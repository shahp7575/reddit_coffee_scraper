1oin1qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityApps/comments/1oin1qh/why_i_consider_bucketmatch_part_of_my/,Why I Consider BucketMatch Part of My Productivity Toolkit (and You Should Too),"A few months ago, I found myself staring at my bucket list feeling… stuck. I had dreams—skydiving, writing a short story, taking a spontaneous trip—but no clue how to actually make them happen. Then I stumbled on BucketMatch. Within days, I was connected with people who weren’t just talking about their dreams—they were doing them.

I joined a local group planning a weekend hiking trip. I matched with someone halfway across the country who was tackling the same goal: running a half-marathon in under two hours. Having someone to swap advice with, cheer each other on, and share mini victories made my bucket list feel real for the first time. It wasn’t about checking boxes; it was about being part of a community that made life feel bigger and brighter.

By the end of that first month, I had crossed off two items I’d been procrastinating for years, met new friends who pushed me gently out of my comfort zone, and started planning a mini-adventure abroad. BucketMatch didn’t just give me a tool—it gave me momentum.

BucketMatch is a social platform that connects people with shared bucket list goals, helping them turn ideas into real experiences. It’s more than a list—it’s a community of doers.

Many apps let you track goals or jot down dreams, but BucketMatch stands out because it actively helps you find companions, resources, and inspiration. It turns passive wishlists into living, breathing adventures.

Here's a few key trends shaping this space:

* **AI-Powered Matchmaking**: BucketMatch’s engine actually matches you with people whose goals, timelines, and interests align with yours.
* **Community Momentum**: You’re not just checking off items alone—you can find local meetups or global buddies.
* **Actionable Planning Tools**: From mini-steps to full itineraries, the app keeps your plans realistic and achievable.

# Who Needs It (and When?)

BucketMatch is perfect if you feel stuck or like life is moving faster than you are. Maybe you’ve had a wake-up moment—turning 30, finishing school, a career shift, or even a health scare—and realized you don’t want to let your “someday” list sit there.

You know you’re ready if you’ve ever:

* Started a list of dreams but never done more than dream.
* Felt lonely tackling goals that seem too big to do alone.
* Wanted to feel accountable but don’t want it to feel rigid.

Basically, it’s for anyone who wants to live boldly, but wants a friendly community to make it fun and achievable.

# How I Chose the Best Tools for Bucket List Apps

I tried a bunch of apps before landing on BucketMatch, and here’s what mattered most:

1. **Community**: I wanted people who could cheer, inspire, and sometimes even join me.
2. **Ease-of-use**: I didn’t need complicated spreadsheets—just clear ways to plan and track.
3. **Matching**: The more aligned my goals were with others, the more motivating the experience.
4. **Affordability**: Something that actually adds value, not another subscription I forget about.
5. **Scalability**: Could it grow with my ambitions? I wanted it to support small weekend adventures and bigger, life-changing goals.

Other apps were fine for lists, but none made you feel like you were part of a movement the way BucketMatch did.

# Why BucketMatch Is Sprinting Ahead

I’ve tried other apps, and they all work on some level—but BucketMatch is different. It doesn’t just ask you to list goals; it actively pairs you with people, events, and mini-milestones that make achieving them feel exciting and inevitable.

The AI matchmaking works surprisingly well. Within my first week, I had connected with three people pursuing similar life goals. The planning tools are practical, yet flexible, so you can tackle a 5K run or a trip abroad without feeling like you need a project manager.

It feels like the perfect companion for anyone serious about living boldly, while still respecting your own pace and comfort zone. Community, accountability, and inspiration all in one place—I honestly haven’t felt this motivated in years.

  


# FAQs

**1. What is a bucket list app?**  
It’s an app that helps you create, track, and achieve personal goals or experiences. The best ones also connect you with others for support and accountability.

**2. How do I choose the right bucket list tool?**  
Consider whether you want community, planning tools, or just a tracker. Try apps that align with your style and goals.

**3. Is BucketMatch better than other apps like Bucket or LifeTick?**  
If you want community and real-life action, yes. Others may be better for purely tracking goals or travel.

**4. How does a bucket list app relate to goal-setting?**  
Bucket lists are often life goals that are aspirational or adventurous. Apps help break them down into actionable steps.

**5. If I’m already successful with other productivity tools, should I try BucketMatch?**  
Yes. BucketMatch complements traditional planning by adding community and inspiration.

**6. How quickly can I see results?**  
Many users, including myself, saw momentum within the first month—mini-adventures, completed goals, and new connections.

**7. What’s the difference between free and paid tiers?**  
Free tiers often limit matches or planning tools. Paid tiers unlock more connections, advanced planning, and enhanced tracking.

**8. Best alternatives to bigger competitors?**  
If you’re considering Bucket, LifeTick, or Polarsteps, BucketMatch often provides more action-oriented community engagement, making it ideal for turning dreams into experiences.",1,1761689268.0,ProductivityApps,0,1.0,False
1oin0r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oin0r0/he_m30_wanted_unprotected_sex_i_f28_dumped_him/,"He (M30) wanted unprotected sex, I (F28) dumped him and now he begs for a second chance","I matched a guy on OLD a month ago. We met for coffee the same day. Immediate deeptalk, lots of banter. And lookswise he´s 100% my type. Fast forward we went on two more dates, the second one lasted a full day, on the third we went to my place. Our first kiss was the best I´ve ever had. He was dominant at times, told me to shut up or grabbed my throat lightly. But I liked it. Sometimes I stopped and he immediately pulled away and asked if I´m okay. Felt totally safe around him.

**On our fourth date** however things went downhill. The original plan was to eat at his place and go out later. He started cooking and I pulled him into bed repeatedly bc I was...very horny. We ended up naked and I blurted out *""Just take me""*, pushing myself against him and holding his penis onto my private parts. He came closer and I stopped *""That´s dangerous"" -* *""Are you concerned about pregnancy or STI? I´m tested. Also you´re on your period and pre-cum doesn´t usually contain sperm. It´s very unlikely."" - ""Not really"" - ""Do you know how getting pregnant works? I wasn´t even close to penetrate you"" - ""It felt very close"" - ""Okay. You know my orgasms take ages, it worked before*."" - *""Are you FOR REAL? I don´t feel like sleeping with you anymore. At all"".*

He asked what´s wrong and I said I always use condoms. He said he did pull out with his ex for two years. They agreed to abort the child in case the method failed. Also he had pull out sex with one long term female friend who has low fertility and who he trusted to be STI free. Otherwise he uses condoms. He even brought condoms for proof: *""Sorry for not discussing protection earlier. Also it hurts that you´re not into me anymore. We should have sticked too cooking""*. I agreed. *""And sorry for not telling you I strictly use condoms""* \- *""It´s ok for now. Would you be willing to try pull out when theres more trust?""* \- *""It has nothing to do with trust but safety!""* \- *""Ok but then I´ll probably won´t finish*...*""*

After a while, we ended up making out and he came onto my face on purpose which set me off again. Him: *""Oh I thought now everything´s fine between us"".* He suggested a walk. But I wanted to leave. He walked me home, crying. He texted me how much he likes me and that he wants to figure it out.

**The next day** he greeted me with flowers. I didn´t want them. We went to his place and talked for hours, calmly. He asked to hold my hand but I rejected. I said it felt like he was trying to persuade me to have unprotected sex. He made clear that he just wanted to share experiences. He apologized if his words made me feel pressured. He never wanted to have sex with me until I´m tested. But I couldn´t believe him. I confessed my feelings, still my trust is broken. He cried, *""Seemingly you already made up your mind...you´re stubborn...and leaving is dumb if we like each other""* Me: *""You seem very self-important. You believe to know what´s best for me"".* We cuddled and I apologized for being ambivalant. He promised to keep fighting for me but I didn´t want him to.

At 4AM he texted me he´s feeling remorse for how he phrased things, nothing was meant the way I understood it. He can´t erase my hurt but I should please try to believe in his intentions. I ignored it. The next day he called me trying to meet up spontaneously, I told him again I need space. One day after he sent me a letter saying he doesn´t want to come across as invasive, *""We can meet in two weeks at xyz spot. I won´t expect an answer""*.

It´s two weeks later, radio silence and tomorrow is the day he intended to meet. Since I left, he´s on my mind 24/7. I´m torn about my feelings and my broken trust.

**How can we solve this?**

**TL;DR: Fourth date, I stopped making out bc its too dangerous, he told me pull out method is safe, did it in the past, apologized for hurting me, I dumped him. He tried to win me back with flowers and letter, wants to meet tomorrow, I´m unsure**",1,1761689206.0,relationships,3,0.67,False

This community is here to help with anything and everything related to carpets, rugs, upholstery, and floor care — whether you’re:
	•	A homeowner wanting to maintain your carpets,
	•	A renter trying to deal with a stubborn spill before inspection,
	•	A pet owner dealing with constant mess (we get it 🐶🐱),
	•	Or a professional cleaner willing to share knowledge and experience.

No matter your background — you’re welcome here.

⸻

What You Can Do Here
	•	Ask for stain removal advice
	•	Share before & after cleaning results
	•	Recommend products, tools, and machines that worked for you
	•	Learn how to care for different carpet fibres
	•	Discuss steam cleaning vs dry cleaning
	•	Ask whether a job is DIY or “call a professional”

If you’re unsure how to treat a stain, ask first — don’t rub!
Rubbing often forces the stain deeper into the fibres.

⸻

How to Ask for Help

When posting a cleaning question, include:
	•	The type of stain (wine, coffee, soot, pet accident, etc.)
	•	What you’ve already tried
	•	A photo if possible (super helpful)

This makes it much easier for people to give good advice.

⸻

Professionals

Cleaners and technicians are welcome — but the focus is helping, not advertising.

Offer knowledge, not sales pitches.
If your advice is valuable, people will naturally ask how to reach you.

⸻

Let’s Start the First Conversation

Comment below:
What’s the worst stain you’ve ever had to deal with?

I’ll go first. 👇

Hi everyone,

After COVID, I developed severe cognitive impairment, whole-body neuropathy, and constant intrusive thoughts while trying to figure out what was wrong.

I ordered a Genova NutraEval test, which showed low methionine and methylation issues that may be affecting my phospholipid synthesis, neurotransmitter balance, and nerve repair—along with mood regulation.

I’m trying to understand:
	1.	How can I restore conversion to methionine and SAMe?
	2.	Why might my body not be producing enough methionine/SAMe?
	3.	Can anyone recommend reliable sites for gene testing related to methylation or amino acid metabolism?

I cant wait for our visit, are we still doing the McDonalds Fries food visit? i have bought the picture tix in advance so thats covered :) ooooooooh i cant wait lol :D i miss you so much.!!! So i think i did good on the test, I feel so relieved to be done with that part now i can focus on the math alone. and then.....we work on YOUR GED ;) its ok you can do it, il help you :) we will do it together. I love you to the far reaches of the Univerce”, Ken says to Gypsy, “Hey darling, I'm sorry I missed your late night phone call tonight, I truly am horribly sick and can't even move out of bed right now let alone talk on the phone... and about —someone— it's okay lover I didn't mean to make you feel that way, I'm totally okay with you talking to her about anything and everything. I got your wonderful letter today and will be writing you back either today or tomorrow if my sickness tones down Love you forever -K” 


2.  Ken says to Gypsy “Hey lover, Summertime has finally hit Seattle, and it’s hotter than ever. I look outside my window at all the lush greenery, and daydream of taking you for a hike through the trails in my neighborhood, showing you the broken down train carts (no idea how they got there, the river with endless rocks to hop over, the molded over bridges that shake when you walk on them (dont worry, i gotcha), and maybe even stop by the hammocks that strangers put up and just swing with you for awhile. God, I miss you. By this point Ive heard all about your 4th, and im happy you got to spend it with your best friends in there and eat some good food :) I didnt get any good food (apart from the 'misplaced' cheeseburger i found) and even though you heard all about the stupid things i did at the festival there, I managed to have a great time, although the fireworks just weren't quite as incredible without being able to hold you close to me while watching them. One day, one day. Well, it’s back to the grind for me. My days are filled with nothing but work again, and the drive to make as much money as possible to get to Missouri as soon as I can. But what else is new, right? I made a new friend at work, his name is —someone— and he's probably one of the nicest people Ive ever met. Just a genuinely good person, ya know? Anyway, we're gonna be new workout buddies. He's very educated on what to eat pre/post workout, and what supplements and vitamins to take. Which I know NOTHING about, so, this will be awesome. Oh, and hes fucking huge, so, im gonna listen. So there you have it, I’ll bet you think I live some incredibly exciting life, but no, its pretty routine. Just work, try and exercise when I can, and spend as much time talking to my one and only as possible. Have I mentioned yet that I love you like crazy? Your new haircut sounds pretty hot. I cant wait to see the new color soon, if they allow it. Long hair, short hair, bangs, or curls, whenever see you, you make my mouth water; Nobody brightens me up quite like you. Wont go blonde huh? I dont know... with those brown eyes of yours.. it might just be a super cute look.. we'll see :) Hahah, oh yeah, the Mariner's... Yeah I dont think I ever seem to talk about baseball except when Im around you, you adorable fuck. But yeah we just swept the Royals in your hometown.. What happened to KC? You guys won the world frickin series a few years ago.. but anyway, ill save the sports talk for the visitation room :) I love how you and I have the same habit, even a year later, of going back and re-reading old letters just to see how far we've come, and just to see what we were talking about back then. Me trying to play it cool, pretending I didnt have this massive crush on you (how well did that work, huh?) and planning out our very first visit *sigh* And here we are. Planning so much more. Dont you just love how life can take you down such unexpected roads sometimes? Lets just roll down the windows, throw the top down, and turn the music up. As long as I have you with me, I dont care where we end up.” 


3.  Ken says to Gypsy, “ Dear Gypsy,
You're all thats on my mind lately. I cant help but wonder how you feel sometimes. What you're thinking. What you're doing. And whats stressing you out. You're constantly in my thoughts. And not always in the happy sense of the meaning, sometimes Im placing myself in your shoes, envisioning the walls around you, with the countless set of rules in place. Imagining the people you share a room with and are forced to interact with, regardless of how much you may like them or not. I cant even pretend to know how that must feel from time to time. Just know Im always praying for you and I want to be here for you for any hard times you face. Im always just a phone call or a visit away. Like ive said before, were in this together. Youre my life partner, and even if its an uphill climb sometimes, if you ever get tired you can just hop on my back and Ill try my best to carry the both of us. Your feelings are my feelings. Your stress is my stress. We both face it everyday. But I like to think were doing okay so far. Were one year in, and I wouldnt turn back for anything. I just love you too damn much. Youre letter you read to me over the phone really hit home with me, and I want to do better for you. Just know im never intentionally vague, or keeping secrets from you. I trust you whole-heartedly, and I want you to feel the same way. Sometimes my life really is just that boring, where just dont have a whole lot to say week after week of what ive been doing. It really just comes down to work most of the time. Trying to get this move taken cared of. Sometimes I wish I could just stumble across a large sum of money somehow and just DO IT. Im just as sick as you are of talking about it. I really just want to be there. No more than an hour away from you, and spend as much time together as possible as we get through this challenge were facing. Just know I AM coming babe. I promise. This weekend has been pretty un-eventful for me as well. I think after all might just stay here at the house for a little while longer. Me and my roommates have worked out all of our differences and Im just gonna keep quiet downstairs for a little while. So feel free to write the same ol address :) Oh man, next time you call me, remind me to tell you the story of how I horribly insulted this family at the bar yesterday. It’s been bothering me all day =( I just miss you so much. More so than ever. Now that ive had these visits, time away from you is torture. I just want to hold your hands and stare into those gazing brown eyes of yours. Have i mentioned lately that im just absolutely crazy about you? No? Well, just know that having a picture of us (not this recent visit, not a fan) as my phone wallpaper just isnt enough anymore. I need more Jersey in my life :) hope your weekend has been great.

Gypsy says to Ken, “GoodMorning Lover, it is the morning of october 1st, Happy Birthday!!!! i just wanted to say that i love you, and though i DID get upset with you last night about knowing who called you, i realize you were just trying to protect me, however DONT ever lie to me again.. dont care how good your intentions are.lies are a gateway to losing me. i love you beyond words in this relationship there is no room for secrets or lies, i have trust issues but trust you just as you trust me lets keep our honest love alive, so let this be the end of this topic. I love you always, you and you alone are my everything. yours GypsyRose” 


6.  Gypsy says to Ken, “Good afternoon Darling, thank you again for calming me last night. i get so defencive and protective of us, its only because i know what we have is real and i just dont wanna lose the best thing thats ever came into my life. i emailed Kristy and told her that we both agree ya'll all all need to meet FIRST and that you will get the chance to talk with my Dad and have that ""moment"" so i said, but its Ken’s choice WHEN that moment will be and if its sooner rather then later then i hope they can find it in their hearts to be happy for us. and everyone will have their time with me even if im right across the street or in New Orleans with you.”, Gypsy also says, “just sending you a reminder that no matter what,..i choose YOU above ALL others and i cant wait to be cudding with you on OUR couch in OUR own place with OUR baby Balto :) without a doubt, im coming home to YOU I love you more and more everyday”

To feel like my existance means something, to live life and feel the joys of sharing life with you. (FUCK im crying again)” 


8.  Gypsy says to Ken, “Gooooood Morning Lover, i had the best dream and guess who was in it??...well you Duhhh :) il just tell you about it on the phone lets just say it was vivid and naughty.

11.  Gypsy says to Ken, “My dear lover,
so just found out i have used up my special visits for the year so it probably will be a few months before we could have another, Bryan's got denide due to me having so many this year eventhough really you and I have only had 2 this year once in March then again in June so maybe its only 2 in a yr span. so i guess next month will have to be only 1 session per day one Friday Sat and one Sun this bites as i love spending the full day with you” 


12.  Ken says to Gypsy, “Dear Gypsy,
Won't you please write me an email tonight telling me about your day. Tell me about the girl at school who talked too much. The stain you got on your shirt at lunch. Tell me about a funny thought you had when you were waking up, but had forgotten about. Tell me how crazy everyone is, and we can laugh about it. Even if I get home late, and the world is already asleep, just send me a message about one little thought you had today, because I love the way you look at the world. I'm so happy I get to hear about your daily adventure, and look at the world through your eyes. Love you”, Gypsy says to Ken, “hey there handsome well somthing totally shocking happened today, i told —someone— where to go. i have never in my life got loud with somone but today i had my fill, dude she called me B$SSS, i said ""who you call'n B$$I$$? B$$$S! when i say i have cohones as big as Texas i am all MOFO impowered now.”


13.  Gypsy says to Ken, “Goodmorning My Love, just waking up with thoughts of you lingering from a dream, its only 7am and already had to rub on poptart :) hope you have a good day love talk to you soon. хохохохохохох”, Ken says to Gypsy, “Hey babe, I'm writing this to you as I got off work, it's around 1:30 am on Saturday morning. I just miss you so much, and often wonder constantly how you're doing. I just needed to say thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart, for sticking with me through this difficult time in my life. I definitely find myself over-worked and paying less attention to the things that matter most to me, which is you. It's crazy how life can be, and how you get tangled up in the little things that make you lose focus on what matters most. Just know you're still my \#1, and everything I do is for US. It's all working towards OUR future. I never know what tomorrow will bring, but I'm happy to jump through these hoops knowing that you're with me in my heart through thick and thin, just like I am for you. I can never tell you this enough, but I love you so much, and am forever grateful to have such an amazing girl like you with me always. I hope youre having an amazing day.. I miss you - K” 


14.  Gypsy says to Ken, “ Hi My Love. so i read that is does take about a day to send and receive an email that bites but hey its better then nothing. the way the kiosk is programd i can get on for 10 min once every hour. but when i have my tablet it wont have a time limit of how lona i can be on it. anvavs i love vou as alwavs and miss ya bunchs! ttyl Your Barbie Gyp” , Gypsy says, “Dear Lover, i am getting ready to head to bed, wishing you were laying beside me. talkng with you today made me so happy it is really the high light of my day and night just to hear your voice. you dont know just how much i love and charish u.someday i can show you but for now its the little kisses that have to do:) you are the best thing that has come into my new life and i am so blessed you have chosen to be in my life and become a huge part of what gets me through this hardship. i am foever your Barbie/poptart :) i love you goodnight and sweetdreams my life partner xoxoxoxoxoxox” , Gypsy says, “Hey sweets, I'm just now waking up this morning of 8/8.

1oimmlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1oimmlv/every_productivity_system_i_tried_for_10_years/,"Every productivity system I tried for 10 years, what failed spectacularly, and what finally worked.","I've been chasing productivity for over 10 years. I've bought every planner, tried every app, tested every methodology that promised to fix my discipline problems. Most of it was expensive bullshit that looked good on Instagram but collapsed under real-world pressure.

Here's my hall of shame, the lessons learned, and what actually stuck.

**THE GRAVEYARD: Systems That Failed Me**

**Bullet Journaling ($200+ in notebooks and pens):** Looked beautiful for exactly 11 days. Then I missed one day of logging, felt like I ""ruined"" the aesthetic, and never opened it again. The system requires too much daily maintenance when you're already struggling with discipline.

**The Pomodoro Technique:** Great in theory. In practice? My work doesn't fit into neat 25-minute blocks. Client calls run long. Deep work needs longer than 25 minutes to get into flow. The timer became an annoying interruption rather than a helpful structure.

**Getting Up at 5 AM:** The ""miracle morning"" crowd will hate this, but forcing myself awake at 5 AM just made me exhausted and resentful. I'd be productive for a few days, then crash hard and sleep until 9 AM for a week straight. Turns out I'm not a morning person, and no amount of discipline changes your circadian rhythm.

**Elaborate Morning/Evening Routines:** I tried building a 90-minute morning routine with meditation, journaling, exercise, cold showers, and a perfect breakfast. It was unsustainable. One disruption (early meeting, sick kid, bad sleep) and the whole thing collapsed. These routines are too fragile for real life.

**Motivation-Based Systems:** Any system that relied on ""just being motivated"" or ""finding your why"" failed spectacularly. Motivation is a terrible foundation. It's like trying to build a house on quicksand.

**Time Blocking My Entire Day:** I'd spend 30 minutes color-coding my calendar with every task, then something urgent would come up at 10 AM and blow up the entire day. The rigidity made me feel like a failure when reality didn't cooperate.

**THE PATTERN IN ALL THESE FAILURES:**

They all required too much activation energy, too much perfection, or too much daily maintenance. They worked great when life was calm and I was motivated. They all collapsed the moment I faced stress, disruption, or just a normal Tuesday.

**WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS: The Anti-Fragile System**

After burning through all those failed experiments, I finally found principles that work *especially well* when life gets messy:

**The 2-Day Rule:** Never miss the same habit two days in a row. Miss Monday's workout? That's life. Miss Tuesday too? Now you're building a pattern of failure. This single rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system I've tried. It builds in forgiveness while preventing total collapse.

**Decision Minimization:** I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. These seem like tiny decisions, but they compound into decision fatigue. Eliminating them preserves mental energy for work that actually matters. No morning decision-making when willpower is already low.

**The 5-Minute Start:** I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. No negotiation, no motivation required...just 5 minutes. Here's the thing: 90% of the time, I continue past those 5 minutes once the initial friction is overcome. Starting is the hardest part. This removes the mental barrier entirely.

**Trigger Stacking:** I attach new habits to existing automatic behaviors. Stretch while the coffee brews. Read while on the exercise bike. Listen to audiobooks while commuting. The existing habit becomes the trigger for the new one. No additional willpower required.

**Weekly Course Correction:** Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked, what didn't, and adjusting for the coming week. I don't beat myself up over failures—I treat them as data points and iterate. This is the *only* tracking I do, and it's maintenance that actually pays off.

**Simple Phone Blocking:** I use a simple blocker on my phone to kill access to social media, news, and other time-sinking distractions. Here's the key: I set it up so I *can't* disable it in a moment of weakness. I use the earn your screen time one but any blocker works. Key is keep it simple and get one that just works without needing to play any ""streak"" games. I achieve my goals and then my apps unlock. Simple.  My phone became a tool again instead of a slot machine.

**WHY THESE WORK (And the Others Didn't):**

* **Low maintenance:** I spend 30 minutes per week on the system, not 30 minutes per day
* **Built-in forgiveness:** The 2-Day Rule expects imperfection
* **No activation energy:** Trigger stacking and prep eliminate the need for willpower
* **Resilient to chaos:** When life explodes, this system bends instead of breaking
* **No tracking anxiety:** I'm not maintaining streaks or checking apps multiple times daily

The common thread? All of these reduce friction and remove the need for willpower. Discipline isn't about forcing yourself through misery... it's about designing a system where the right actions become the path of least resistance.

**THE EXPENSIVE LESSONS:**

* Complexity is the enemy of consistency
* If a system requires daily maintenance, it will eventually fail
* Instagram worthy ≠ actually effective
* Your system needs to work on your worst days, not just your best ones
* Trying to change everything at once guarantees changing nothing
* Forgiveness and flexibility beat perfection and rigidity

I spent 10 years learning this. These unglamorous principles have given me more actual progress than all those failed systems combined.

Skip the graveyard. Start with what works.

i know my life would be better if i had any respect for my circadian rhythm, yet at the same time i feel so much like myself during those quiet hours. the solitary little joys. the idea of letting that time go is excellent in theory but seemingly impossible in practice. something tells me that a lot of you are similar to me in this way. but i wanna hear what your nights are like :-)

a couple nights ago i had a dream that my estranged father and i were sitting in a living room together, reminiscing, having a beautiful lively conversation. i was called away someplace, maybe a party, and was talking to other people and doing other things, but in my mind’s eye i could still see my father in that room. he had pulled a stack of orange post-its from his pocket. on each one he wrote a memory of us, things i had said or places we had been, and he arranged them atop the coffee table in neat rows. he was smiling so fondly. he was laughing a little to himself. it made me happy. the last time we spoke was six years ago.

All suggestions are appreciated.

If it helps, I play alt-country, Americana, western grunge...originals and covers like Tyler Childers, Zach Bryan, Red Clay Strays, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Fred Eaglesmith, Rolling Stones, Bob Seger, Nirvana, Gary Stewart, Hank Jr. and a bunch more. So I'm looking for a solid place to book a 3 hour solo gig. Never played in the area, so bars, restaurants, and other businesses that HAVE music, but aren't necessarily a place I'd need to be known to have a crowd show up are a plus.

1oimhnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oimhnv/how_to_get_my_ex_back_and_is_it_even_a_good_idea/,"How to get my ex back, and is it even a good idea","This is gonna be a long post, but im desparate for help, ive been dealing with so much anxiety and stress for the last 2 years because of this, so i would appreciate anybody that reads it.

Basically, I (21yo M) was in a relationship with my GF (19yo F) for around 2 and a half years (officially). In our relationship we had truly beautiful times together, and truly loved eachother, at the beginning of the relationship, she was head over heels, and i was kinda a dumbass with my ways, and was still talking to my ex ex, which my GF knew, shit hurt her and i didnt do much for the first half year since that was the way i was wired by my previous relationship. After that time i started fixing myself and being the best possible towards my gf to fix the dumb mistakes i did before, at this point (atleast half a year into the relationship) we were still going strong, yes she was hurt, but the ""love"" was stronger. 

Then something started happening with my ""friend"" or lets say a male person i talked to kinda a lot on certain days when we saw eachother but not over text messages or anything like that. Basically she wasnt doing anything wrong, but the guy started blatantly going into our space, talking to her while im in the middle of a convo with her, sitting next to her when they travelled as a group (always had to be next to her even though there was 10 other people he knew longer than her and talked more with). And i hated that, i had a bad feeling about it since im a man and i know our tactics and i didnt like it one bit. So i firstly talked to her about it in a normal manner and she brushed it off as she doesnt even like him and that he is just friendly and nothing more. Time went on and shit was happening every time they travelled together in that same group (its a sports thing) and again, at no point did she do anything wrong around him but i still hated the fact that she was oblivious to him trying to get close to her. We started arguing around it, i asked her nicely to keep a little more distance between them and tell him that he shouldnt focus that much on talking to her, helping her, sitting next to her and all that. She just said i got nothing to worry about im overreacting and that she doesnt want anything to do with him but that she feels its dumb for her to tell him that he should keep more distance between them. 

So okay time went on again, every competition the same story, she wont answer her phone, she sends 1 message per like 3 4 hours, and everytime they post a photo of the group, he is next to her every single time. We were fighting so much around that stuff that she started to ignore me more and more on the competitions so that i dont down her mood. And then once she told me she isnt going with them to a arcade room, and next thing i know, an hour later i get a snap from a third person (from the group) and what do you know, she is driving them to the arcade. I went ballistic, and she again turned off her phone so that i dont ruin her mood, and just kept having fun with them. Be wary that that was literally the first true lie she ever told me, she was a saint before that, you could always trust everything she said. (To resume the timeline this was already like almost 2 years into the relationship. 

Similar fighting kept on happening for the same reasons for another half of a year, until she finally had enough and broke it off with me. The thing is, after breaking up, we kept on talking, we kept on going out for coffee, even having sex. Everything was pretty much the same as while we were in a relationship, besides the ""on paper"" being in a relationship. Since stuff stayed the same, i still hated everything around that guy and we still fought constantly, until we started practicing ""no talk"". I never could go through with it, we mostly didnt talk for 4 days, then talk again for 5, and so on. 

She then tells me one day that she likes him, since they started talking more deeply and says he gave her the support i never gave her. We fight again, 5 weeks pass, and she then tells me that i was pretty much right and that she didnt actually like him but she just found some peace in someone listening to her after going through so many fights with me. Then 5 more weeks and she stopped talking to the guy all together because she says she became even worse than me ( and just to clarify, they didnt do anthing thats out of bounds of the friend status, no kissing no touching nothing, they just talked and grabbed like 2 coffees together). 

Then after some lectures and subtle fighting we just kept on going with our usual 4 days no talking 5 days talking, with the here and there seeing eachother (going shopping, grabbing a coffee, once or twice a month having intimate moments). But every time we had sex especially, or every time we talked a lot for a few days, she just suddenly stops responding and ghosts my messages (she said that especially after having sex she just feels it isnt a right thing we are doing and that she has grief and doesnt want to talk, want us to go ""no talk again""). And that cycle kept on going for like a year after we broke things off, and then we come to the more recent times. 

She met a new guy at uni, again started talking, again he showed clear signs of interest and again she is straight up clueless (the dude literally took her to the cinema and reserved lovebox seats for a horror movie, which, may i add, she rejected me when i asked her to come watch that same movie with me because in the last half a year she has had problems with anxiety when watching horror films) but again, nothing happened ever between them, and he is literally the opposite of her type, but even with clearly stating how much that shit hurts me multiple times, she said she wont get rid of a guy that is just her friend. And that she doesnt see how and why she would need to do that when she obviously doesnt want anything to do with him.

Then they went to a party with some more of her new female friends and one male friend, and ofc she didnt send even 1 message the whole night, and then at 3 am i get messages explaining how the guy is a total asshole and that he left them for another table, and that i was right about him. 

And what do you know, 2 days later, when i ask about it again, she sees no reason to remove him from her life as she isnt interested in him and he has test answers from older generations of uni students so she needs him for that. I just gave up on this and we went on in our vicious no talk-talk cycle for another month or 2.

And then we come to the present times. We started doing more serious ""no talk"" stages, we havent talked for 3 weeks, she was on a trip with her female friend, and out of the blue i get a call from her, i rush home from my friends house and call her back, she is calling me because her friend is ruining the trip for them because she has been quiet for 2 days and"" mad"" at her for no reason and idk i guess she called me to comfort her or make her happy whatever.

Then again no contact, then we see eachother and have sex after some time, again she feels guilt, we dont talk for 2 weeks, then i come over to bring her a flower boquet for her birthday, we have an intimate moment again 2 days later, and then a week later i see that another friend from the same sport has her as his #1 bff on snap (i literally saw this so randomly) and i ask her about it and she tells me that they started snapchatting at the last competition, and that she kinda started liking him there and if she had a chance she would try a relationship with him. (Remeber we had sex like 3 days before she told me this). 

And just to make it even more interesting, this same guy im talking about, has a girlfriend (almost 2 years), and this same guy openly liked my girlfriend while we were still together 2 years ago, everyone knew about it. And im like, why the fuck do you intentionally do the most hurtful things with the most hurtful people to me when you know what you put me through in the last 3 years. And she says she cant control her feelings (which i kinda do understand since you cant choose if you like somebody or not) but come on.

And she promises to me that they dont talk, they dont text, they dont even put text on their snaps, that they just exhange 2 snaps per day. 

And now i kinda exploded with everything that has built inside me over the years and we decided to do a long and real no contact phase (which im struggling with as always, every night my thought are just processing the worst scenarios of her being with him, blah blah..) 

And just to top it all of like a cherry on top, if you remember the second guy i mentioned (the one that took her to the cinema), just yesterday she had a competition in a city near here, and he needed a lift from that city, so she drove him from that city home, and they stopped in a mcdonalds, and he paid for her meal and she again sees all of this as a normal friend and no need to worry because she doesnt want him.

Oh yeah and an important detail i forgot to mention was that for the last  year of this ""situationship"" she told me on multiple ocassions that she wants to have feelings for me, but that they just arent there, that she wants to be happy when she sees me like she was before, but it just isnt like that anymore. And that she kept on going out with me and talking just so i dont hurt (which i kinda call bullshit on since you cant force yourself to go every other day with somebody you dont care about, you cant force smiles that much, kissing, sex, everything, maybe its partly true, but no way thats the whole truth).

And its also good to mention that she still wears my hoodies, she still wear the necklace and bracelet i bought her on different occasions when shes not with me, she still has most of the stuff i got her in her room, she still sleeps with the plushies i bought her..

Now tell me, firstly, am i delusional for thinking she can go back to her old self?
Am i delusional for still believing that she still feels something for me deep inside because of the signs shes shown?

And if there is still a chance, judging by all of the above, what type of approach do you think would win her back, make her come back to me. 
Torturing myself through a long no contact phase  till she maybe feels that she made the wrong choice? Showing that i changed? Working on myself? What do i do.

And just a heads up, i am well aware of my faults, and i acknowledge most of them, and fought myself to fix most of them and never repeat them again. But she literally just got worse and worse, never changed anything, and just kept repeating the same mistakes that she knew all along already hurt me so many times.

Truly from the bottom of my soul APPRECIATE anybody who took the time to read all this and gave me advice, love you all and thanks for helping me get out of this depression, stress and anxiety filled hole i am in.


TL;DR:

I fucked up at the start of the relationship, then fixed it, then we were fighting mostly because she was oblivious to another guy around her attempting to get close, fighting went on for almost 2 years, she had enough and broke it up, then she almost ended up in a relationship with that same guy, but in the end stopped talking to him all together, told me i was right about him, then proceeded to find a new friend that wanted the same thing, she was oblivious once again, once again told me i was right when she saw his true identity, but still kept talking to him, we were in a situationship while all of this was happening again, then she proceeds to start liking a guy that wanted her when i was in a relationship with her, while shes sleeping with me, and now we are in no contact and i am asking you people of reddit for advice on what to do to get her back, or if its even a smart thing to do.",1,1761687953.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

So okay time went on again, every competition the same story, she wont answer her phone, she sends 1 message per like 3 4 hours, and everytime they post a photo of the group, he is next to her every single time. We were fighting so much around that stuff that she started to ignore me more and more on the competitions so that i dont down her mood. And then once she told me she isnt going with them to a arcade room, and next thing i know, an hour later i get a snap from a third person (from the group) and what do you know, she is driving them to the arcade. I went ballistic, and she again turned off her phone so that i dont ruin her mood, and just kept having fun with them. Be wary that that was literally the first true lie she ever told me, she was a saint before that, you could always trust everything she said. (To resume the timeline this was already like almost 2 years into the relationship. 

Similar fighting kept on happening for the same reasons for another half of a year, until she finally had enough and broke it off with me. The thing is, after breaking up, we kept on talking, we kept on going out for coffee, even having sex. Everything was pretty much the same as while we were in a relationship, besides the ""on paper"" being in a relationship. Since stuff stayed the same, i still hated everything around that guy and we still fought constantly, until we started practicing ""no talk"". I never could go through with it, we mostly didnt talk for 4 days, then talk again for 5, and so on. 

She then tells me one day that she likes him, since they started talking more deeply and says he gave her the support i never gave her. We fight again, 5 weeks pass, and she then tells me that i was pretty much right and that she didnt actually like him but she just found some peace in someone listening to her after going through so many fights with me. Then 5 more weeks and she stopped talking to the guy all together because she says she became even worse than me ( and just to clarify, they didnt do anthing thats out of bounds of the friend status, no kissing no touching nothing, they just talked and grabbed like 2 coffees together). 

Then after some lectures and subtle fighting we just kept on going with our usual 4 days no talking 5 days talking, with the here and there seeing eachother (going shopping, grabbing a coffee, once or twice a month having intimate moments). But every time we had sex especially, or every time we talked a lot for a few days, she just suddenly stops responding and ghosts my messages (she said that especially after having sex she just feels it isnt a right thing we are doing and that she has grief and doesnt want to talk, want us to go ""no talk again""). And that cycle kept on going for like a year after we broke things off, and then we come to the more recent times. 

She met a new guy at uni, again started talking, again he showed clear signs of interest and again she is straight up clueless (the dude literally took her to the cinema and reserved lovebox seats for a horror movie, which, may i add, she rejected me when i asked her to come watch that same movie with me because in the last half a year she has had problems with anxiety when watching horror films) but again, nothing happened ever between them, and he is literally the opposite of her type, but even with clearly stating how much that shit hurts me multiple times, she said she wont get rid of a guy that is just her friend. And that she doesnt see how and why she would need to do that when she obviously doesnt want anything to do with him.

Then they went to a party with some more of her new female friends and one male friend, and ofc she didnt send even 1 message the whole night, and then at 3 am i get messages explaining how the guy is a total asshole and that he left them for another table, and that i was right about him. 

And what do you know, 2 days later, when i ask about it again, she sees no reason to remove him from her life as she isnt interested in him and he has test answers from older generations of uni students so she needs him for that. I just gave up on this and we went on in our vicious no talk-talk cycle for another month or 2.

And then we come to the present times. We started doing more serious ""no talk"" stages, we havent talked for 3 weeks, she was on a trip with her female friend, and out of the blue i get a call from her, i rush home from my friends house and call her back, she is calling me because her friend is ruining the trip for them because she has been quiet for 2 days and"" mad"" at her for no reason and idk i guess she called me to comfort her or make her happy whatever.

Then again no contact, then we see eachother and have sex after some time, again she feels guilt, we dont talk for 2 weeks, then i come over to bring her a flower boquet for her birthday, we have an intimate moment again 2 days later, and then a week later i see that another friend from the same sport has her as his #1 bff on snap (i literally saw this so randomly) and i ask her about it and she tells me that they started snapchatting at the last competition, and that she kinda started liking him there and if she had a chance she would try a relationship with him. (Remeber we had sex like 3 days before she told me this). 

And just to make it even more interesting, this same guy im talking about, has a girlfriend (almost 2 years), and this same guy openly liked my girlfriend while we were still together 2 years ago, everyone knew about it. And im like, why the fuck do you intentionally do the most hurtful things with the most hurtful people to me when you know what you put me through in the last 3 years. And she says she cant control her feelings (which i kinda do understand since you cant choose if you like somebody or not) but come on.

And she promises to me that they dont talk, they dont text, they dont even put text on their snaps, that they just exhange 2 snaps per day. 

And now i kinda exploded with everything that has built inside me over the years and we decided to do a long and real no contact phase (which im struggling with as always, every night my thought are just processing the worst scenarios of her being with him, blah blah..) 

And just to top it all of like a cherry on top, if you remember the second guy i mentioned (the one that took her to the cinema), just yesterday she had a competition in a city near here, and he needed a lift from that city, so she drove him from that city home, and they stopped in a mcdonalds, and he paid for her meal and she again sees all of this as a normal friend and no need to worry because she doesnt want him.

Oh yeah and an important detail i forgot to mention was that for the last  year of this ""situationship"" she told me on multiple ocassions that she wants to have feelings for me, but that they just arent there, that she wants to be happy when she sees me like she was before, but it just isnt like that anymore. And that she kept on going out with me and talking just so i dont hurt (which i kinda call bullshit on since you cant force yourself to go every other day with somebody you dont care about, you cant force smiles that much, kissing, sex, everything, maybe its partly true, but no way thats the whole truth).

And its also good to mention that she still wears my hoodies, she still wear the necklace and bracelet i bought her on different occasions when shes not with me, she still has most of the stuff i got her in her room, she still sleeps with the plushies i bought her..

Now tell me, firstly, am i delusional for thinking she can go back to her old self?
Am i delusional for still believing that she still feels something for me deep inside because of the signs shes shown?

And if there is still a chance, judging by all of the above, what type of approach do you think would win her back, make her come back to me. 
Torturing myself through a long no contact phase  till she maybe feels that she made the wrong choice? Showing that i changed? Working on myself? What do i do.

And just a heads up, i am well aware of my faults, and i acknowledge most of them, and fought myself to fix most of them and never repeat them again. But she literally just got worse and worse, never changed anything, and just kept repeating the same mistakes that she knew all along already hurt me so many times.

Truly from the bottom of my soul APPRECIATE anybody who took the time to read all this and gave me advice, love you all and thanks for helping me get out of this depression, stress and anxiety filled hole i am in.


TL;DR:

I fucked up at the start of the relationship, then fixed it, then we were fighting mostly because she was oblivious to another guy around her attempting to get close, fighting went on for almost 2 years, she had enough and broke it up, then she almost ended up in a relationship with that same guy, but in the end stopped talking to him all together, told me i was right about him, then proceeded to find a new friend that wanted the same thing, she was oblivious once again, once again told me i was right when she saw his true identity, but still kept talking to him, we were in a situationship while all of this was happening again, then she proceeds to start liking a guy that wanted her when i was in a relationship with her, while shes sleeping with me, and now we are in no contact and i am asking you people of reddit for advice on what to do to get her back, or if its even a smart thing to do.",1,1761687844.0,relationships,1,0.67,False

1oimeqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/GATEhouse/comments/1oimeqr/orders_an_inbetween_story/,Orders. (an in-between story),"*Writer's note: Yes I am still alive. And this is a departure from the norm. But whatever. Writing is writing and progress is progress.*

*And Driscoll may not be human anymore. But recovering and moving forward under your own power is as human a trait as any. Even if its at a slow pace.*

*Enjoy.*

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

""No ma'am the burgers are sold at the restaurant across the street."" Driscoll said calmly to the older minotaur as she waited in  line. ""We are partnered with them though. We supply their buns, breads, and some of their desserts.""

He auto-piloted through the rest of the conversation. His mind heavy with the call he'd gotten that morning.

The elderly woman left with half a dozen buns (one silver) and a cheesecake sampler (one gold) that she'd insisted her grand-kids would love as he nodded with a smile. As she turned to leave he continued folding the layered butter and dough that would go on to be turned into croissants.

""Next order."" Pileta, a young Dryd (this world's equivalent to dryads, apparently) called as she rang up another order that was slid over in its paper bag by Boris, a remarkably normal Petravian human who was collecting and packing the foods. ""Three folk rolls, a bag of bagels and one..... smeplie turnover ring. That'll be..."" She tapped the order into the tablet that was set into the back of the counter where customers couldn't see it. ""2 gold, four silver, and seven copper."" She informed them.

Driscoll set the laminated dough down and began rolling it out. He was already three folds in and on this one he would be layering in the chocolate and the dehydrated raspberry. He didn't get the Earth fruit deliveries too often. But when he did he always tried to introduce a new item that would sell well, and immediately. This time it was chocolate raspberry croissants.

As he rolled the dough out he glanced up at the curious Petravians that were watching him work from the other side of the glass display. They were... MOSTLY... children.

""What are those going to be?"" Miss Durna, one of their regulars, asked as she passed by with a cup of coffee and a strudel in her hand.

""Uhh. Croissants."" He replied as he reached over to the sifter of chocolate powder. ""Surprise flavor. Got our Earth shipment last night.""

""Oooh! Save me one."" She said as she continued to her favorite spot and opened the book she'd been reading all week.

""You got it Miss Durna."" He said with a chuckle. ""Hey Pil."" He called to Pileta. ""Charge Miss Durna five gold for one of these.""

""Got it boss!"" She called back as she rang up another customer.

""Oh you absolute bandits!"" Miss Durna exclaimed, smiling, before taking a sip of her coffee.

An even coating of chocolate and he set the tin aside in favor of the raspberries he'd spent all night dehydrating before crushing into a fine powder. A few minutes later he had a nice, even, dark layer of delectable chocolate and berry on the dough and he folded it once more.

As he answered a question about their cakes he tried not to think of the call.

It had been nearly one in the morning when his house's bell had rang. When he'd woken up he'd looked over out of his bedroom door and seen the amber glow that marked it as being a delivery for the shop.

He'd thought he'd been brilliant by having the system set up. A sign on the front door telling delivery couriers that if it was for him they could ring the bell on the front door. But that if it was for the bakery they needed to go around back and ring the bell next to the back loading bay.

Choi had introduced this world to burgers and soups and things. But Driscoll was the one responsible for introducing the concept of a doorbell. Or at least an doorbell that was more than just an ACTUAL bell over the door.

He'd begun regretting it almost as soon as he'd installed the system and the signs with their guidance (including a sign that literally pointed them at the button).

He'd groaned and rolled off his bed to open his window and tell the delivery worker to give him a second. It had only improved his mood a tiny bit to see that they were an Earth courier.

Ten minutes later and he'd been unloading a bottomless bag from the delivery company and been happy to see all his fruits and veggies from Earth in good order.

Or at least he'd thought that was all he was getting, until he'd opened the crate of oranges and seen a calling card inside, set neatly on the top of the fruit.

Call us regarding your order.

Below which had been a scan code for his phone.

Anyone else might have assumed it was a simple marketing card. But he had gotten business cards from the fruit companies he'd ordered through. They'd all been eager to up their business with him once they'd realized he was ordering their food for Gate transit.

No. This card had definitely been from his former employers/owners.

Once he'd gotten the food put away and the raspberries set in the dehydrator he'd pulled his phone out and scanned the card.

It hadn't even given him an option and had immediately begun dialing a number that it wouldn't display.

Not even one full ring and he was listening to someone.

""Driscoll's Delic-"" He'd begun before being cut off.

""Full name and D.O.B."" They demanded.

""Elliot Roland Driscoll. One, eight, seventeen."" He said. His eyebrows furrowed at how instinctive that had been for him. He hadn't even thought before replying.

""Copy that. Please hold."" They said.

He looked at the phone with more than a little annoyance. It was still not even two o'clock yet.

A moment later a familiar voice spoke up. One from long before he'd ever come over to this world. Back before he'd regained his humanity by, unironically, becoming non-human.

""Good evening Elliot. How are you?"" Director (ret.) \[Redacted\] said into the phone. ""Or I suppose it's early morning over there according to my computer. I hope I didn't wake you.""

Driscoll's blood ran cold at the faintly Indian accent of his former creator/owner/leader.

He gulped as he took a deep breath.

""Director?"" He said, doing what he could not to sound nervous. ""No I... I called you. It's fine. How can I help you?""

""Well we have a little situation over on our side here Elliot. I was hoping...""

The rest of the call was a blur. Both from the unexpected contact from someone he'd hoped to never hear from again, from how tired he'd been up until that second, and because of the content of the conversation.

""Excuse me Mister Driscoll?""

He snapped back to the present.

He looked up from where he'd gotten a fifth fold out of the croissant dough, and saw the familiar face of Kolna Diligent. A fellow were-fox like Driscoll was.

Driscoll glanced to the side where Pileta was trying NOT to smile. He was glad his fur was already red.

Kolna had, over the past month or so, become their most frequent customer.

And it had taken him until only a few days ago, and being told flatly by Pileta AND Miss Durna, to realize that while Kolna liked the food here, it wasn't why she kept returning.

""Ah. Miss Diligent."" He said, shaking himself out of his distracted thoughts about his early morning disruption. ""How can I help you today?""

""For the millionth time. It's just Kolna Mister Driscoll."" She said before pointing down at the dough he was working on. ""What is that? It smells incredible.""

""A new croissant."" He said. ""Using an Earth fruit called a raspberry. And some chocolate."" Then he nodded a bit. ""And as long as this counter's between us I'll stick with Miss Diligent. Professional standards. You know?""

""Must be an Earth thing."" She replied. ""Maybe you should have the given name of Diligent?"" She joked, referencing her honorary name that had been granted among the Folk. It wasn't the first time she'd made the joke either.

The first time she'd made that joke he'd shot back about how Earthers only got new last names when they married or legally had them changed, and in the case of the former it was usually the man's last name that was carried over. They'd had a few more quips between them, and looking back after Pileta and Miss Durna had explained it to him he'd realized she'd been flirting even back then.

HE was not accustomed to..... attraction. And not in either direction.

He'd never had the time, energy, or even just plain old physiological desire in his old life. Those urges and hormones and what not were, even nine years later, still a confusing concept to him.

And having a, seemingly schizo, fox running around in his consciousness telling him what to do didn't make handling them any easier.

Hence why he'd become so hesitant to interact with the, admittedly very pretty, were-fox since he'd been keyed in on why she showed up every day.

He cut the sheet of dough into long strips and then began cutting those strips into the triangle shape that would result in them forming perfect spiral pastries.

A few minutes later the croissants were baking and he was working on a babka.

And he was still trying not to think of the request the director had made. Which he knew wasn't really a request.

\---------------

Hours later, as the sun began to set and he watched Pilete, Boris, and his backroom staff leave for the day, Driscoll called the only other person he could think of.

And he got her voicemail.

She was probably on the other side of the planet exploring some weird country that the Petravians barely knew about. No satellite coverage. At least not right now.

So, disappointed but not surprised, he departed to pick himself up some dinner before turning in for the night.

He may not have been in his old suit with its sensor suite, but his senses were still strong enough that he knew who was waiting for him when he stepped outside.

""You really should be the one called diligent."" She joked again as he rounded the corner and she fell in beside him. ""It's nearly two hours past closing and you're only just now leaving?""

""I think the fact that you've waited all that time for me when there was a good chance I didn't even leave, is a good sign that that name is safely yours Miss Diligent."" He said sheepishly as he used her arrival as a distraction from the call. He jerked a thumb over his shoulder at the bakery. ""Especially since I live above the bakery. For all you knew I could've just stayed home.""

""Hence why I DO have the name."" She replied easily. ""And there's no counter between us.""

He nodded awkwardly as they continued walking.

It was quiet, minus the city's bustle.

Too quiet.

Uncomfortably quiet.

And she read that as easily as he did. But was significantly more comfortable addressing it.

""You're not comfortable around me are you Mister Driscoll?"" She asked. She looked at him curiously as he glanced at her, once again glad that his fur already made his face red by default. ""And yet you're also not really HERE right now either.""

He rubbed his neck awkwardly.

""I'm not comfortable around very many people. No."" He admitted while avoiding the question. ""And I've just got a lot on my mind right now.""

""Well I'm sorry to hear that."" She said. ""If you're willing, could I join you for dinner? Assuming that's where you're heading.""

Driscoll considered the question.

On the one hand he was still uncomfortable. But he.... also didn't really have a valid reason to say no besides wanting to.

She was, as far as he knew, very nice. She worked at the local children's school as a teacher and had even brought some of the students to the shop a few times. And she'd always been friendly and easy to talk to.

Plus she was pretty, even if his Earth (and pre-were) upbringing made even that fact awkward for him.

And.... honestly.... he needed someone to talk to. And the only other person who could relate was who knew where.

Twenty minutes later they were sitting at a restaurant that he hit maybe once every week or so. He ordered a drink called a Crisper, which was basically a lemon and apple tea with whiskey in it, and a sausage stew that he knew was fresh on this day of the week. She ordered a sandwich and some wine.

""So. What's got you so pensive?"" She asked as the drinks came to the table.

He considered that as he sipped at his drink.

""Soo... you know I'm an Earther."" He said. ""That's fairly common knowledge.""

She nodded. He gestured at himself.

""And obviously I'm one of the folk. Which is.... not common for Earthers. Especially as a non-wolf."" He continued. She nodded again. ""How much else have you managed to learn about me from Pil and Miss Durna?"" He asked.

She seemed to consider the question as she set her wine glass down.

""I know that you were an emergency conversion."" She said. He looked up at her, surprised that they would reveal something like that. ""And also that you used to be with the Earth Military.""

He nodded. ""Both true."" He said. ""I wasn't like the soldiers you've probably met here in the capital though.""

Her head tilted, curious. ""How so?""

He cringed a bit. ""I was a bit more like Spokesman Vickers than I was like any of the standard soldiers."" He said. ""Not really a line soldier. More of a special forces scenario.""

Her head tilted back the other way, in that way that a lot of the Folk did. But knowledge of Earth's military, at least to a basic level, was already fairly common in this world. And especially here in the capital.

""And now you're not?"" She wondered. ""That's odd.""

""Well that's the issue."" He said, unsure of just what he COULD and COULDN'T tell her. ""An old um... commander...  of mine got in touch with me today and ASKED me to do something."" He looked down into his cup. ""People like me and Vickers.... we don't every really... STOP being that kind of thing. Not in their eyes anyways.""

""And I'm guessing they want you to do something you're not comfortable with?"" She asked. ""Have you reported it to the guard? Would you?""

He shrugged. ""I don't know. It's honestly not even a bad thing to do. And I don't think it's any kind of security risk or anything."" He looked off into the distance outside the nearby window. ""But it would require that I cross back over for a while. And.... and do some stuff that I... don't think I'm comfortable with.""

""Then don't do it."" She said easily.

He looked at her with a pained expression. ""It's not really that easy."" He pointed at his head. ""It's like the fox in here."" He said. ""There's a part of me that yearns to do as its been told and fall in line. To be part of that again even if it doesn't make sense.""

She nodded, as if that made perfect sense to her. And why wouldn't it. She had a fox in her brain too. Even if she'd been born with it unlike him.

""Do you like your bakery?"" She asked. He was taken aback by the question.

""Of course."" He said easily. ""Best thing that ever happened to me.""

""And Pileta and Boris and the rest. You like having them around? They're good workers?"" She followed up.

""They're great."" He replied. ""Pil's gonna make a great baker herself some day. In fact if I ever open up a second shop I'll probably let her run it if she's willing. Same for Lomni."" He said, referencing his backroom baker.

""And you're not... kind of... military anymore?"" She wondered. ""Retired or discharged or whatever?""

""You could call it that."" He said. He didn't need to go into details about HOW he'd gotten away from his old duties.

""Then just... tell them you won't do it."" She said. ""It might be difficult. You might feel bad. But it doesn't seem like you have any obligation to do anything for them.""

He nodded. It was essentially what he'd already planned on doing. But it still felt good to hear someone else say so. It was more or less what he would have expected Five to say.

""So..."" He said as their meals arrived and he tried to break the silence that had followed her suggestion. ""How did you like the croissants?"" He asked as he tried a spoon of his stew.

She smirked. ""A bit sour for my taste. But the chocolate more than made up for it."" He was about to respond when she continued. ""Why are you so uncomfortable around me?""

He spluttered a bit, almost choking on the carrot he'd been about to eat.

""I'm not-I'm..."" He sighed. Why even lie?"" I... am... uncomfortable around you."" He admitted painfully.

She looked hurt for just a second. But years of working with kids had taught her to handle unexpectedly painful statements. Kids had a habit of saying hurtful things without knowing it.

""Can I ask why?"" She asked.

*How do I even answer that?* He thought. *Well, I spent nearly twenty years as a*, *literally, dickless killer cyborg. I don't know how to handle attraction or even arousal because I've never had that kind of hardware. And I don't handle social interactions well because I never had any* *outside of the other killer cyborgs. I can't tell her that.*

""I'm.-I don't have a lot of experience with women."" He admitted glumly. ""Or... people... outside of work.""

""Oh thank the gods."" She said with a note of relief, causing him to look at her curiously. ""I thought you were going to tell me you were into men. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I just would've been so embarrassed that I hadn't picked up on that if that'd been the case.""

""No. No."" He said, somehow LESS comfortable than he already wasn't. ""I'm-I... I like women."" He didn't mention the part where his lack of romantic experience meant he actually DIDN'T know if he was into guys or not. But he didn't think he was.

""Thennnn..."" She began, this time being the one who felt awkward. ""Do you think you could give me chance? Maybe see if I can be that experience?""

He thought about it for a few moments. When he'd requested his release from the embassy one of his main reasons had been to ""get the full human experience now that he had a normal body"". And yes... he had seen the irony in that reason.

Outside of general discomfort he had no real reason to deny her.

""Umm. If I did... could we go slow?"" He asked.

She smiled. And he was glad to see that the smile seemed genuine, and warm.

They spent the rest of the meal discussing the ins and outs of both teaching and baking. And they set a date for an ACTUAL date later in the week.

\---------

Driscoll woke the next morning and pulled out his phone as he stood on his balcony with a cup of coffee. A few button taps later he was reconnecting to the Director.

He spoke before the Director could.

""No."" He said firmly.

""Mister Driscoll."" The Director began to retort. ""You'd be doing your country-""

""I said no. Sir."" He reiterated. ""I'm not going back to Earth. I'm not returning to any of the D.S.S.F. facilities."" He steeled himself. That old part of his brain was rebelling against what he was saying. ""If any of them want to ask questions I'd be willing to talk to em. A call or video chat or something. But I'm not your..... I'm your weapon anymore."" He said, his voice catching as he said the words he'd ached to say for years now without even realizing it. ""My life is here. If they're thinking of turning... talk to the Lunar Council. I'm out. Don't call me again. Driscoll signing off.""

He hung up the call before the Director could even say another word. And his phone was shut off before it could even think of ringing with a return call.

He nodded at Boris, who was walking up the back alley below toward the rear entrance of the bakery, the sweet scent of Earth tobacco wafting up from the cigarette he'd made a habit of smoking despite their exorbitant cost.

On his way back inside Driscoll threw the phone into his nightstand, intent on forgetting about it if possible.

He had a bakery to open. And his Miss Diligent, who he supposed he should probably just start calling Kolna now, was probably going to stop by before she went to work.

And for the first time in years, since he'd decided to open his business really, he felt like he'd finally made a decision of his own.

He downed his coffee and headed downstairs to begin opening up.

""No ma'am the burgers are sold at the restaurant across the street."" Driscoll said calmly to the older minotaur as she waited in  line. ""We are partnered with them though. We supply their buns, breads, and some of their desserts.""

He auto-piloted through the rest of the conversation. His mind heavy with the call he'd gotten that morning.

The elderly woman left with half a dozen buns (one silver) and a cheesecake sampler (one gold) that she'd insisted her grand-kids would love as he nodded with a smile. As she turned to leave he continued folding the layered butter and dough that would go on to be turned into croissants.

""Next order."" Pileta, a young Dryd (this world's equivalent to dryads, apparently) called as she rang up another order that was slid over in its paper bag by Boris, a remarkably normal Petravian human who was collecting and packing the foods. ""Three folk rolls, a bag of bagels and one..... smeplie turnover ring. That'll be..."" She tapped the order into the tablet that was set into the back of the counter where customers couldn't see it. ""2 gold, four silver, and seven copper."" She informed them.

Driscoll set the laminated dough down and began rolling it out. He was already three folds in and on this one he would be layering in the chocolate and the dehydrated raspberry. He didn't get the Earth fruit deliveries too often. But when he did he always tried to introduce a new item that would sell well, and immediately. This time it was chocolate raspberry croissants.

As he rolled the dough out he glanced up at the curious Petravians that were watching him work from the other side of the glass display. They were... MOSTLY... children.

""What are those going to be?"" Miss Durna, one of their regulars, asked as she passed by with a cup of coffee and a strudel in her hand.

""Uhh. Croissants."" He replied as he reached over to the sifter of chocolate powder. ""Surprise flavor. Got our Earth shipment last night.""

""Oooh! Save me one."" She said as she continued to her favorite spot and opened the book she'd been reading all week.

""You got it Miss Durna."" He said with a chuckle. ""Hey Pil."" He called to Pileta. ""Charge Miss Durna five gold for one of these.""

""Got it boss!"" She called back as she rang up another customer.

""Oh you absolute bandits!"" Miss Durna exclaimed, smiling, before taking a sip of her coffee.

An even coating of chocolate and he set the tin aside in favor of the raspberries he'd spent all night dehydrating before crushing into a fine powder. A few minutes later he had a nice, even, dark layer of delectable chocolate and berry on the dough and he folded it once more.

As he answered a question about their cakes he tried not to think of the call.

It had been nearly one in the morning when his house's bell had rang. When he'd woken up he'd looked over out of his bedroom door and seen the amber glow that marked it as being a delivery for the shop.

He'd thought he'd been brilliant by having the system set up. A sign on the front door telling delivery couriers that if it was for him they could ring the bell on the front door. But that if it was for the bakery they needed to go around back and ring the bell next to the back loading bay.

Choi had introduced this world to burgers and soups and things. But Driscoll was the one responsible for introducing the concept of a doorbell. Or at least an doorbell that was more than just an ACTUAL bell over the door.

He'd begun regretting it almost as soon as he'd installed the system and the signs with their guidance (including a sign that literally pointed them at the button).

He'd groaned and rolled off his bed to open his window and tell the delivery worker to give him a second. It had only improved his mood a tiny bit to see that they were an Earth courier.

Ten minutes later and he'd been unloading a bottomless bag from the delivery company and been happy to see all his fruits and veggies from Earth in good order.

Or at least he'd thought that was all he was getting, until he'd opened the crate of oranges and seen a calling card inside, set neatly on the top of the fruit.

Call us regarding your order.

Below which had been a scan code for his phone.

Anyone else might have assumed it was a simple marketing card. But he had gotten business cards from the fruit companies he'd ordered through. They'd all been eager to up their business with him once they'd realized he was ordering their food for Gate transit.

No. This card had definitely been from his former employers/owners.

Once he'd gotten the food put away and the raspberries set in the dehydrator he'd pulled his phone out and scanned the card.

It hadn't even given him an option and had immediately begun dialing a number that it wouldn't display.

Not even one full ring and he was listening to someone.

""Driscoll's Delic-"" He'd begun before being cut off.

""Full name and D.O.B."" They demanded.

""Elliot Roland Driscoll. One, eight, seventeen."" He said. His eyebrows furrowed at how instinctive that had been for him. He hadn't even thought before replying.

""Copy that. Please hold."" They said.

He looked at the phone with more than a little annoyance. It was still not even two o'clock yet.

A moment later a familiar voice spoke up. One from long before he'd ever come over to this world. Back before he'd regained his humanity by, unironically, becoming non-human.

""Good evening Elliot. How are you?"" Director (ret.) \[Redacted\] said into the phone. ""Or I suppose it's early morning over there according to my computer. I hope I didn't wake you.""

Driscoll's blood ran cold at the faintly Indian accent of his former creator/owner/leader.

He gulped as he took a deep breath.

""Director?"" He said, doing what he could not to sound nervous. ""No I... I called you. It's fine. How can I help you?""

""Well we have a little situation over on our side here Elliot. I was hoping...""

The rest of the call was a blur. Both from the unexpected contact from someone he'd hoped to never hear from again, from how tired he'd been up until that second, and because of the content of the conversation.

""Excuse me Mister Driscoll?""

He snapped back to the present.

He looked up from where he'd gotten a fifth fold out of the croissant dough, and saw the familiar face of Kolna Diligent. A fellow were-fox like Driscoll was.

Driscoll glanced to the side where Pileta was trying NOT to smile. He was glad his fur was already red.

Kolna had, over the past month or so, become their most frequent customer.

And it had taken him until only a few days ago, and being told flatly by Pileta AND Miss Durna, to realize that while Kolna liked the food here, it wasn't why she kept returning.

""Ah. Miss Diligent."" He said, shaking himself out of his distracted thoughts about his early morning disruption. ""How can I help you today?""

""For the millionth time. It's just Kolna Mister Driscoll."" She said before pointing down at the dough he was working on. ""What is that? It smells incredible.""

""A new croissant."" He said. ""Using an Earth fruit called a raspberry. And some chocolate."" Then he nodded a bit. ""And as long as this counter's between us I'll stick with Miss Diligent. Professional standards. You know?""

""Must be an Earth thing."" She replied. ""Maybe you should have the given name of Diligent?"" She joked, referencing her honorary name that had been granted among the Folk. It wasn't the first time she'd made the joke either.

The first time she'd made that joke he'd shot back about how Earthers only got new last names when they married or legally had them changed, and in the case of the former it was usually the man's last name that was carried over. They'd had a few more quips between them, and looking back after Pileta and Miss Durna had explained it to him he'd realized she'd been flirting even back then.

HE was not accustomed to..... attraction. And not in either direction.

He'd never had the time, energy, or even just plain old physiological desire in his old life. Those urges and hormones and what not were, even nine years later, still a confusing concept to him.

And having a, seemingly schizo, fox running around in his consciousness telling him what to do didn't make handling them any easier.

Hence why he'd become so hesitant to interact with the, admittedly very pretty, were-fox since he'd been keyed in on why she showed up every day.

He cut the sheet of dough into long strips and then began cutting those strips into the triangle shape that would result in them forming perfect spiral pastries.

A few minutes later the croissants were baking and he was working on a babka.

And he was still trying not to think of the request the director had made. Which he knew wasn't really a request.

\---------------

Hours later, as the sun began to set and he watched Pilete, Boris, and his backroom staff leave for the day, Driscoll called the only other person he could think of.

And he got her voicemail.

She was probably on the other side of the planet exploring some weird country that the Petravians barely knew about. No satellite coverage. At least not right now.

So, disappointed but not surprised, he departed to pick himself up some dinner before turning in for the night.

He may not have been in his old suit with its sensor suite, but his senses were still strong enough that he knew who was waiting for him when he stepped outside.

""You really should be the one called diligent."" She joked again as he rounded the corner and she fell in beside him. ""It's nearly two hours past closing and you're only just now leaving?""

""I think the fact that you've waited all that time for me when there was a good chance I didn't even leave, is a good sign that that name is safely yours Miss Diligent."" He said sheepishly as he used her arrival as a distraction from the call. He jerked a thumb over his shoulder at the bakery. ""Especially since I live above the bakery. For all you knew I could've just stayed home.""

""Hence why I DO have the name."" She replied easily. ""And there's no counter between us.""

He nodded awkwardly as they continued walking.

It was quiet, minus the city's bustle.

Too quiet.

Uncomfortably quiet.

And she read that as easily as he did. But was significantly more comfortable addressing it.

""You're not comfortable around me are you Mister Driscoll?"" She asked. She looked at him curiously as he glanced at her, once again glad that his fur already made his face red by default. ""And yet you're also not really HERE right now either.""

He rubbed his neck awkwardly.

""I'm not comfortable around very many people. No."" He admitted while avoiding the question. ""And I've just got a lot on my mind right now.""

""Well I'm sorry to hear that."" She said. ""If you're willing, could I join you for dinner? Assuming that's where you're heading.""

Driscoll considered the question.

On the one hand he was still uncomfortable. But he.... also didn't really have a valid reason to say no besides wanting to.

She was, as far as he knew, very nice. She worked at the local children's school as a teacher and had even brought some of the students to the shop a few times. And she'd always been friendly and easy to talk to.

Plus she was pretty, even if his Earth (and pre-were) upbringing made even that fact awkward for him.

And.... honestly.... he needed someone to talk to. And the only other person who could relate was who knew where.

Twenty minutes later they were sitting at a restaurant that he hit maybe once every week or so. He ordered a drink called a Crisper, which was basically a lemon and apple tea with whiskey in it, and a sausage stew that he knew was fresh on this day of the week. She ordered a sandwich and some wine.

""So. What's got you so pensive?"" She asked as the drinks came to the table.

He considered that as he sipped at his drink.

""Soo... you know I'm an Earther."" He said. ""That's fairly common knowledge.""

She nodded. He gestured at himself.

""And obviously I'm one of the folk. Which is.... not common for Earthers. Especially as a non-wolf."" He continued. She nodded again. ""How much else have you managed to learn about me from Pil and Miss Durna?"" He asked.

She seemed to consider the question as she set her wine glass down.

""I know that you were an emergency conversion."" She said. He looked up at her, surprised that they would reveal something like that. ""And also that you used to be with the Earth Military.""

He nodded. ""Both true."" He said. ""I wasn't like the soldiers you've probably met here in the capital though.""

Her head tilted, curious. ""How so?""

He cringed a bit. ""I was a bit more like Spokesman Vickers than I was like any of the standard soldiers."" He said. ""Not really a line soldier. More of a special forces scenario.""

Her head tilted back the other way, in that way that a lot of the Folk did. But knowledge of Earth's military, at least to a basic level, was already fairly common in this world. And especially here in the capital.

""And now you're not?"" She wondered. ""That's odd.""

""Well that's the issue."" He said, unsure of just what he COULD and COULDN'T tell her. ""An old um... commander...  of mine got in touch with me today and ASKED me to do something."" He looked down into his cup. ""People like me and Vickers.... we don't every really... STOP being that kind of thing. Not in their eyes anyways.""

""And I'm guessing they want you to do something you're not comfortable with?"" She asked. ""Have you reported it to the guard? Would you?""

He shrugged. ""I don't know. It's honestly not even a bad thing to do. And I don't think it's any kind of security risk or anything."" He looked off into the distance outside the nearby window. ""But it would require that I cross back over for a while. And.... and do some stuff that I... don't think I'm comfortable with.""

""Then don't do it."" She said easily.

He looked at her with a pained expression. ""It's not really that easy."" He pointed at his head. ""It's like the fox in here."" He said. ""There's a part of me that yearns to do as its been told and fall in line. To be part of that again even if it doesn't make sense.""

She nodded, as if that made perfect sense to her. And why wouldn't it. She had a fox in her brain too. Even if she'd been born with it unlike him.

""Do you like your bakery?"" She asked. He was taken aback by the question.

""Of course."" He said easily. ""Best thing that ever happened to me.""

""And Pileta and Boris and the rest. You like having them around? They're good workers?"" She followed up.

""They're great."" He replied. ""Pil's gonna make a great baker herself some day. In fact if I ever open up a second shop I'll probably let her run it if she's willing. Same for Lomni."" He said, referencing his backroom baker.

""And you're not... kind of... military anymore?"" She wondered. ""Retired or discharged or whatever?""

""You could call it that."" He said. He didn't need to go into details about HOW he'd gotten away from his old duties.

""Then just... tell them you won't do it."" She said. ""It might be difficult. You might feel bad. But it doesn't seem like you have any obligation to do anything for them.""

He nodded. It was essentially what he'd already planned on doing. But it still felt good to hear someone else say so. It was more or less what he would have expected Five to say.

""So..."" He said as their meals arrived and he tried to break the silence that had followed her suggestion. ""How did you like the croissants?"" He asked as he tried a spoon of his stew.

She smirked. ""A bit sour for my taste. But the chocolate more than made up for it."" He was about to respond when she continued. ""Why are you so uncomfortable around me?""

He spluttered a bit, almost choking on the carrot he'd been about to eat.

""I'm not-I'm..."" He sighed. Why even lie?"" I... am... uncomfortable around you."" He admitted painfully.

She looked hurt for just a second. But years of working with kids had taught her to handle unexpectedly painful statements. Kids had a habit of saying hurtful things without knowing it.

""Can I ask why?"" She asked.

*How do I even answer that?* He thought. *Well, I spent nearly twenty years as a*, *literally, dickless killer cyborg. I don't know how to handle attraction or even arousal because I've never had that kind of hardware. And I don't handle social interactions well because I never had any* *outside of the other killer cyborgs. I can't tell her that.*

""I'm.-I don't have a lot of experience with women."" He admitted glumly. ""Or... people... outside of work.""

""Oh thank the gods."" She said with a note of relief, causing him to look at her curiously. ""I thought you were going to tell me you were into men. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I just would've been so embarrassed that I hadn't picked up on that if that'd been the case.""

""No. No."" He said, somehow LESS comfortable than he already wasn't. ""I'm-I... I like women."" He didn't mention the part where his lack of romantic experience meant he actually DIDN'T know if he was into guys or not. But he didn't think he was.

Hi everyone, I m quite new around and I just started to look more into getting a decent coffee lately, even if I had this curiosity for many years. 
At the moment I don t have much kit at all, I got only a filter coffee machine and a 8£ coffee grinder from amazon and I m thinking to get nore things with time. 

I searched the internet a little bit about coffee grinders and I discovered that a decent electric coffee grinder is over 200£ so I m looking for a decent manual coffee grinder?

After looking a little bit here and there I discovered a grinder with great reviews on a very low price (35£) and his name is MHW3-Bomber blade r3. 
Considering the price this one looks like a good price/quality balance and is capable to grind for espresso as well. I m not sure if I will get an espresso machine any time soon due to space consideration I still lime to have the option in the future.

There are any other decent/better quality grinders within 50£ let say or mhw3 bomber is a good choice?

1oilw51,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1oilw51/the_psychological_trick_that_makes_people/,The psychological trick that makes people instantly feel closer to you (it’s not what you think),"Ever notice how some people just *click* instantly, while others stay acquaintances forever? I’ve seen this over and over again in my research circles, grad school friendships, and podcast discussions. And no, it’s not about being overly charming or having the perfect opener. The weird truth? Your brain can literally *fake* connection until it becomes real. The trick? Act like you’re already close.

Sounds like a TikTok gimmick? Maybe. But this one’s actually backed by real science, not just a 19-year-old influencer whispering “just mirror his body language” into an iPhone mic.

This post breaks down what I’ve learned from the best sources — psych research, bestselling books, TED talks, and expert interviews — about *how to build closeness fast*, and why this strange mind trick actually works.

Let’s get into it.

**Here’s why this works: you hack your own perception first**

Your brain doesn’t just observe relationships. It creates them. According to psychologist Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago, our social perceptions are largely shaped by what we *expect* from others. When you *assume closeness*, you behave in a way that invites it back. It’s a form of what social scientists call the “self-fulfilling prophecy,” first introduced by Robert K. Merton in the 1940s.

This is backed by a fascinating study from Stinson et al. (2009) published in *Psychological Science*: When participants were told to believe that others liked them, they actually became warmer, more open, and more likable — and were rated as more likable in return. Their belief shaped their behavior, which shaped the interaction.

Basically, when you act like someone’s already your friend, you signal safety, warmth, and familiarity. That encourages them to drop their guard too.

**Here’s how to use the “already friends” trick without being awkward**

This isn’t about pretending to know someone’s life story or trauma dumping over coffee. It’s about shifting your own mindset *before* and *during* the interaction. Try these:

- **Use “insider” language**: Say things like “You know how *we* always do this” or “Classic us” — it implies shared experiences, even if you’re just joking. This builds an illusion of camaraderie.

- **Reference the future**: “Next time we hang out we need to…” or “This is totally going in our friend history.” Talking about the future together assumes connection will continue.

- **Use casual body language**: People who are close mirror each other’s posture, lean in, and use open gestures. You don’t force this, but when you assume closeness, this tends to flow naturally.

- **Drop the formal tone**: Avoid the “polite stranger” voice. Use your “with friends” tone — more relaxed, more expressive. It signals familiarity.

- **Remember their details** — then bring them up casually. “Did your sister’s dog survive the haircut trauma?” This does more than show interest. It reinforces continuity — another cue of closeness.

**5 resources that go way deeper into this (and rewire the way you connect)**

- **Book: “The Like Switch” by Jack Schafer PhD**  
  This is written by a former FBI behavioral analyst who used these tricks to get *spies* to open up. Insanely readable, super tactical, and packed with weird psychological cues (like the “eyebrow flash” technique). This book will literally make you see every social interaction differently. One of the best books I’ve ever read on social skills.

- **Book: “Platonic” by Marisa G. Franco, PhD**  
  NYT bestseller, and for good reason. Franco’s research is all about why adult friendship feels so hard — and how to make it easier by being intentional. One study she shares: people *underestimate* how much others like them after first meetings. This book will make you question everything you believe about friendships. Highly, highly recommend if you overthink friend dynamics.

- **Podcast: The Happiness Lab with Dr. Laurie Santos**  
  Check out the series on social connection. Especially the episode “How to Talk to Strangers.” It breaks down the psychology of initial bonds and how our brain often sabotages us with false assumptions of awkwardness or rejection. Santos is a Yale psych professor and has a gift for making complex stuff ridiculously clear.

- **YouTube: Charisma on Command**  
  Their video “How to Instantly Make People Like You” breaks down exactly how confident people act like they’re already friends with everyone. It’s filled with examples (from celebrities and real convos) that show how this works in practice. Watch with a notebook. You’ll pick up tricks you can literally use *today*.

- **App: Finch**  
  This app turns self-reflection and emotional check-ins into a game with a cute bird. But beyond the fluff, it’s actually a powerful way to get better at emotional awareness — which is key for social connection. It helps you track your mood before and after social interactions, and helps you prep mentally for hard convos.

- **App: BeFreed**  
  This AI-powered learning app from a Columbia University team builds completely personalized audio lessons from books, research, expert talks, and more. You can choose your host’s tone and even how deep the lesson goes — 10, 20, or 40 minutes. I use it to stay sharp on topics like social psychology, communication, and connection. What’s wild is that it adapts to your learning habits and keeps refining your roadmap over time. It also has a massive library that includes all the books I mentioned above (yes, even *The Like Switch*). If you’re busy but want to level up your relationship skills with real depth, this app’s a cheat code.

This whole strategy isn’t about being fake. It’s about unlocking a version of yourself that sees connection as *already there*. Your brain doesn’t need much to believe that. And once it does, other people start believing it too.",1,1761686555.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

Because I know at my friend place I will not be able to sleep. Never had problems before going that night

This happen to me like a month ago

I was chilling on a bus stop waiting at 3am my bus, and a dude on a scooter was like just passing by but he was looking at me and make a u-turn and stop in front of me, I noticed it and was freaking out inside and bro asked me “Are you a woman ???!” And I proudly say “YES I AM” and dude just took from he’s pocket 100€ and ask me “are you an escort girl ????” WHAT ? HUH ? I was so afraid but at the same time “oooh I have that passing now ?” I said no and he left ABD THAT’S NOT ALL

After that I take my bus and I’m at a train station, it’s 4am I’m tired and I just wanna smoke my cig and take the train, and then ANOTHER MEN talked to me and I never felt that way, trapped, I cannot say no because he was nice but at the same time weird.
First thing bro do he’s giving me a whole pack of cigarettes and start to say things like “can I buy you a coffee ? You’re so pretty, it’s dangerous for a girl that pretty to be alone at night you know ?” 
A lot of sentence like that and I managed to escape without giving my phone number.
Since that night I did understand I’m a target now, I have a cis passing, I’m pretty I guess and eeewwww but god dammit at the same time I felt affirmed in my gender.

I keep a short journal with three columns: trigger, intervention, result; that helped me adjust doses without ending up with overdosing or hidden withdrawal.

On top of that I worked with Legacy Healing Center for structure and monitoring, especially for dual diagnosis, anxiety plus quitting. They helped me set the initial doses with a doctor's input (steady patch plus rescue gum capped at X pieces per day) and taper them every 2–3 weeks based on what the craving journal showed.",1,1761686282.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

One of the benefits is more mundane tasks become more enjoyable compared to when smoking, in my opinion. I think it’s because of dopamine repair, and also not always thinking about a smoke.

I think quitting is actually pretty easy. If you realize how much better it is to be smoke free, it becomes easier to quit.

Anyway, I made an app to assist with quitting various forms of nicotine, you can check it out here:

The main point of the app is the forum. The stat tracking is pretty cool.

I had actually realesed the “Quit Vaping” app on Android in late 2020, and the app got over 24k downloads, but I stopped tending to it and it was pulled from the store. I made this app to support assistance with quitting various forms of nicotine, not just vaping. (I vaped and smoked)

I want to include a taper feature which will guide users on when to use nicotine and gradually reduce usage to 0.

* The Feed your Senses Day: Walk barefoot on grass. Listen to rain. Taste something you’ve never tried. Smell fresh herbs, old books. 
* The Experiment Day: Try that weird technique you bookmarked six months ago. Paint with coffee. Write a song in a genre you hate. Fail spectacularly. Explore mediums that make no sense for your discipline. Dancers try painting, writers play with food. The day you stop experimenting is the day you start dying creatively
* Find your Tribe Day: Reach out. Coffee with a fellow creator. Email that artist you admire. Comment meaningfully on someone’s work. Ask them questions that go deeper. Discover their process, their struggles, their breakthroughs. Your network isn’t just contacts, it’s your creative lifeline.
* The Reflection Day: Look back at everything you made this month. What worked? What didn’t? What patterns are emerging? Study them like evidence. Stop and extract lessons before you immediately rush to the project. Your past work is a treasure trove of intelligence about your future success, but only if you take time to mine it.

1oillfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1oillfq/i_19m_her_19f_how_do_i_progress_this_talking_stage/,I (19M) her (19F). How do I progress this talking stage?,"Hello I'm a freshman in mechanical engineering so is she she is also in my classes and labs. 


Firstly I arrived at this university knowing just 1 person. A close friend of mine that happened to know her because they live close by. 1 month passed I would look at her, she would look at me but we never really interacted. One day we had a physics lab we sat next to each other and I decided to talk to her. We did our in-class work and had a assignment for next week. Unexpectedly she waited for me and wanted to meet me. We took a walk around campus for around an hour. Exchanged socials, i didn't think much since I wasn't really feeling anything about her. First week goes by we talk a little from dms she approached me and we started having small talks here and there or as we waited for public transport we would talk for a bit. Now second week comes by we had a common break from 10 till 12 I got a message she wanted to hang out. Again it was mostly about university and all that but slowly slowly we started learning eachother more and more. 


Another week goes by we continued to talk from Instagram but her response times would range from 2 minutes up until 30 hours. I mirrored her behavior to he fair since I didn't care at the time and then she started double texting to get my attention. Tuesday comes by and we have that common break (its the only time of the week we both have a common break). She Again reached out and wanted to hang out at a nearby coffee shop. This time it was different she Firstly showed me her presentation, then vented about different topics about her putting for class representative. She sat next to me leaned onto me and started talking about her problems and bullying she has been facing in class after a good 2 hours of talking and sharing opinions and seeing how much chemistry we had. I started actually taking a liking on this girl.


During that week I helped her socialize and speak to people in our lectures she never spoke to before. I also spread her opinions around class and managed to gather around 35 people to vote for her. Anyways she did end up losing but texted me the same day ""just know im greatful for everything you did ❤️❤️"".
After that her response times where immediate and would find every chance to be close to me.


Currently its exam week. She is stressed, im stressed everyone is. Her response times are 30-40 hours but sends me tik toks all day. Basically she finds chances to talk to me. Always smiles at me, stares at me when im not looking and her body language is open and different around me and gets closer to me than your average friend. She sends me big voice mails 10-15 minutes. Appreciates me because I understand her and vented how she was never really treated this way, having someone that isn't bored of her talking all day. She does have bad rumors going around in my class and that kind of hurts her.


Now what's the negatives you might ask. 2 days ago she started talking about a blue eyed boy that looks at her and she thinks she mightve took an interest. Then hit me with the ""Im here trying to do love but at the same time I don't want to do love."". Now I did try to hit her with the ""yeah I like a girl too"" card but she seemed a little unhinged about it. Didn't ask me any questions like who. She responded with ""I won't judge just tell me and ill see if I'll help.""


TL;DR I believe she seems me as a bestie/ friend but does invest alot of energy and wants to hang out 1 on 1. At the same time she compliments me and has this behavior.
Im confused on how to continue this and what is really going on. She seems intrested but has pretty on and off behavior. Does speak to me daily at university and we will talk for a lengthy amount of time in or out of class. On Instagram she will leave me on delivered for 1 or 2 days. But proceeds to send me tik toks and answer to mine back. Today marks the 1 month since our first interaction at that lab.",1,1761685846.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1oiljlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kneereplacement/comments/1oiljlk/update_9_days_posttkr_caregiver_perspective/,Update - 9 days post-TKR (caregiver perspective),"I posted a couple of months ago and was given absolutely brilliant advice, nearly all of which we took, and all of which has been spot on. (It was posted from my now-deleted alt account; I’ll link it in the comments if anyone wants it because it was so helpful and reassuring).

Parent had the knee replaced last Monday (outpatient), first physio yesterday, and is off the walker and now using a cane with increasing confidence inside the house (still mainly walking in the house, but we are going to get out to some nice level places to practice). 

—-

I have thoughts about their surgeon, which I probably need to let go of. Their surgeon is “old school” and does a traditional TKR (with a tourniquet and everything)… I’m hopeful parent will go surgeon shopping for the next one as I was unimpressed with how he responded to simple, reasonable questions (from me, asked by parent) about how the procedure works and details of their process (e.g., got quite defensive when asked if a tourniquet would be used, and said he’s been “doing this for 20 years and always uses a tourniquet”) - but that’s really not my business and if parent is happy and progressing well, then I am happy for them. That said, I do want the second op in 6-12 months to be as easy to heal as possible, because their first knee will still be pretty fresh if everything goes right. I’m going to let my suggestions percolate and leave it to parent to decide.

—-

“Non-essentials” that were essential for us…
- A wedge pillow (the triangle kind) and a folding, height-adjustable, angle-adjustable lap desk have gotten a TON of mileage. 
- A heated blanket has given relief to parent’s sore back and neck from back-sleeping and lying around so much. The day we got that blanket, parent perked up immensely, almost as much as after their first poo following surgery.
- The ice machine is great, but we added gel ice packs (we have two Thrive ones and two from Walmart that have their own sleeve and stretchy elastic to wrap). I’ve already seen there are long-freeze ones that I’m going to suggest parent purchases for the next stages of recovery when I’m not here.
- Tennis balls on the walker feet make it easier to use and prevent floor scrapes; useful when there is a toddler also asleep in the house who wakes at the slightest noise in the night!
- The Medisafe app. I set them up on it and then logged in on their account on my phone; for the first five days I totally managed their medications, but taught them to mark them “taken” gradually. By Saturday they were leading the way on that, and Monday I deleted the app from my phone.
- Alarms for physio - we spaced them out so that it finished by 5:30pm, because the parent was about ready to sleep by 7:30pm. Between my ADHD and their brain fog, this was critical to remember to do the exercises three times daily. The first two days home, we missed a round or two, and the impact was noticeable.
—-
As a caregiver I am incredibly lucky. My parent is resilient, determined, did their prehab regularly, and has a clear goal in mind with good mental strategies to get over and through the frustrating moments. If they weren’t “bought in” or weren’t willing to tolerate and push through discomfort, or didn’t have emotional strategies for difficult moments, we would be having a very different experience. That said, it has really bowled them over and they have even said they couldn’t have truly understood what to expect until they did it. Take that how you will!

Thankfully, we already get along great, and we’ve enjoyed revisiting Downton Abbey and the latest season of SVU together. I found my role was primarily to give emotional support, practical assistance in the first three to five days especially, and coach them with their home exercises until they had memorised them and got the technique right. This week, I have been focused on meal prep and making sure easy-grab food is within reach.

My parent and I also made a plan in advance. I would sleep over at theirs for the first five nights, and the next two we would decide closer to the time. I ended up sticking around on the sixth night because their nerve block (which was SO useful) wore off on Friday, and we both wanted them to be confident with elevating using the wedge pillow and applying their own ice wraps. They were already safely self-mobilising on the Tuesday, including getting in and out of bed and going to the toilet. By the Sunday, they were independently showering with a shower chair and getting dressed without help, shoes and shoelaces included. They’ve not actually needed me for anything today, although I did run out and get them a used recumbent exercise bike and some Taco Bell “as a treat”.

—-

Physio was incredibly happy with ROM and walking progress. I think it would have been OK anyway, but I was quite militant about working to keep their 0 extension that they achieved the day of surgery; so we took the towel prop exercise and positioning advice seriously. Mission accomplished. Their walking speed is a few seconds off what the surgeon wants to see (on what I can only describe as a modified shuttle run), and it is already improving now they are on the cane, which is also helping their gait.

The harder challenge for the parent is flexion, and we’ve upgraded those exercises with the physio’s guidance to help them make headway. I am confident once they start their classes later this week we’ll see positive changes just as we have with walking, balance, and everything else. The blocker is stiffness above the knee, so once their tourniquet bruising is healed, hopefully a little bit of massage (if the physio is happy for that to happen) will help things to relax. The parent does plan on taking a half dose of their opioid beforehand for the hour-long classes, and reviewing to see if that’s really needed or not. 

My suggestions for caregivers on HEP support would be:
- Make sure you do coach your person through their home exercises as needed, especially in the first disoriented days, even if they did prehab on their own. The brain fog is intense and having a positive person to help count and push through when needed is beneficial.
- Have them count elephants for the holds - people count seconds too fast and the holds are important for ROM gains and strengthening /stretching.
- Give them physical markers when needed/ if helpful - the parent initially couldn’t calibrate the straight leg raises, so I told them to keep their ankle in dorsiflexion and try to hit my hand with their toes (they would over or undershoot). This really helped them control the motion and focus on going slowly, with their knee properly locked out.

—-

Next steps for us:
- Keep working on that flexion!
- Do a few more “independence challenges” like - heat up your own soup, make your own sandwich, retrieve your own coffee/ set up the coffee pot yourself - to see where we are with things.
- Get outside the house every remaining day of my visit - we walked the mall on Monday, we might go to a nearby park today if the weather holds up, we will try the sidewalks but they’re a bit dippy with all the driveways. Fresh air was really good for my parent, and so was getting a friend round for coffee this morning (parent grumbled a bit but I can tell they have perked up and will have a better nap as a result).

Overall I would say, for caregivers, your job is (relative to your person) to help them get back to a level of safe independence as quickly as possible. That means looking at their prior life, and priorities (needs and wants) and thinking how to transition and give chances to practice doing things assisted, and then on their own, and review how it went. 

You might find little adaptations along the way - like, we borrowed my sibling’s super fancy camping ice chest to make overnight icing easier (no fucking about with the ice machine at 1 a.m., just grab a wrap, get the leg up, and go). That thing keeps a 10lb bag of party ice frozen for most of a week. (Ice blocks are better though.)

1oilfs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oilfs4/i_found_handprints_in_the_mud_behind_my_chicken/,- I found handprints in the mud behind my chicken coop. They weren’t human.," 

The morning was still as a held breath.

Cold clung to the porch railings and silvered the grass. Mist hung low, pooling in the hollows of the yard and drifting like smoke across the street, where the trees stood black and bare, their limbs tangled like old wire.

I slung my work bag over one shoulder and locked the front door behind me. I wore a flannel overshirt and heavy boots, but the chill still found the skin at my neck. The air smelled of wet leaves and something faintly metallic.

I stepped off the porch and paused.

There, in the patch of mud beside the gravel drive, were tracks. Not boot prints. Not paws. Not anything I could name.

They were long, narrow impressions—like the heel of a hand pressed deep into the earth, fingers splayed. But there were no matching footprints. Just those strange palm-shaped marks, staggered and dragging slightly, as if whatever made them had pulled itself forward on its hands alone.

I crouched, frowning. The soil was soft from last night’s rain, and the prints were fresh. I reached out, almost touched one, then thought better of it.

A flicker of movement caught my eye.

Across the street, just beyond the mist, something pale lay at the edge of the woods. I squinted. It looked like a chicken—limp, wings askew, neck twisted at an unnatural angle. One of ours?

I stood slowly, heart beginning to thud.

The coop was behind the house, fenced and latched. Jules and I had built it ourselves last spring, after I got laid off. It was sturdy. Safe.

I turned on my heel and walked fast around the side of the house, boots crunching frostbitten grass. The coop door hung open. The latch dangled, unbroken.

Inside, feathers. Scattered like torn paper. And in the corner, a smear of something dark.

One hen missing. The rest huddled silent, wide-eyed.

I backed away, breath clouding in the air. I looked toward the trees again, but the mist had thickened. The shape was gone.

I stood for a long moment, staring into the mist where it had been. The trees across the street loomed quiet and still, their trunks swallowed by fog.

I closed the coop gently, checked the latch twice. The remaining hens rustled behind me, feathers puffed and silent.

Inside the house, warmth met me like a blanket. The radiator hummed. One of the cats—Moss—wound around my ankles, purring. The others were curled in their usual places: on the windowsill, the armchair, the folded laundry. I counted them without thinking. Five. All accounted for.

I stepped softly into the bedroom. Jules lay curled on her side, one arm tucked under her cheek, hair fanned across the pillow. I leaned down and kissed her temple, lingering just a moment. She stirred but didn’t wake.

I dressed quietly, poured coffee into a thermos, and left for work.

***…***

The office was a converted house on the edge of town, pale green siding and a crooked porch. I worked for the county’s Parks and Trails department—mostly maintenance, sometimes signage, sometimes trail clearing. It was quiet work, and I liked it that way.

But today, I couldn’t focus.

I kept thinking about the prints. The way they dragged. The way they looked like hands.

And the chicken. That pale shape in the mist. It had been there. I was sure of it. But when I looked again, it was gone.

Around ten, my phone buzzed.

**Jules**:  
Did you say one of the chickens was *missing*?

I stared at the screen, thumb hovering.

**Me**:  
Yeah. Coop door was open. One gone.  
Weird tracks in the mud. Like handprints.  
Thought I saw a dead one across the street.  
It disappeared.

Three dots blinked. Then stopped.

**Jules**:  
That’s… weird.

**Me**:  
I know.

I looked out the office window. Mist still clung to the trees behind the building. The same kind of trees. The same kind of quiet.

Ray walked in and dropped a clipboard on the desk. “You good?” he asked.

I nodded. “Just tired.”

But my eyes kept drifting to the woods.

…

By noon, the mist had burned off, but the cold lingered. I was in the garage, strapping my pack to the back of the ATV when Ray came in, rubbing his hands together like he could will warmth into them.

“Trail 9’s yours today,” he said. “Storm last week knocked some limbs down, and we’ve had a couple hikers complain. Nothing major, just messy.”

I nodded, tightening the last strap.

Ray hesitated. “Also… someone reported an abandoned campsite out past the ridge. Way off trail. Said it looked weird. Like someone left in a hurry.”

I raised an eyebrow. “You want me to check it out?”

“Yeah. Just make sure no one’s hurt or squatting out there. Shouldn’t take long. You’ll be back before dark.”

I didn’t say anything, just waited.

He scratched his beard. “I know it’s a stretch, but with all the missing pets this year… I don’t know. Feels off. Cats, dogs, even a goat from that farm on 42. Just gone.”

I frowned. “You think it’s connected?”

“I think I don’t like coincidences,” he said. “And we’re short-staffed. You’re the only one I trust to handle it solo.”

I gave a short nod, swung my leg over the ATV, and started the engine.

…

The trail was easy. A few downed branches, some erosion near the switchback, but nothing I couldn’t clear with a handsaw and a little muscle. The woods were quiet—too quiet. No birdsong. No wind. Just the hum of the engine and the crunch of tires over frost-hardened dirt.

I found the campsite just past the ridge, tucked in a hollow near a dry creek bed.

At first glance, it looked like someone had left in a hurry. A tent collapsed on one side. A camp chair overturned. A cooler cracked open, contents spilled and half-frozen.

Then I saw the tracks.

Same as the ones by my driveway that morning—long, narrow handprints, fingers splayed, dragging through the mud. They were everywhere. Around the firepit. Across the flattened tent. Leading into the woods and back again, like something had circled the site over and over.

It didn’t look abandoned. It looked destroyed.

My stomach turned. Every instinct screamed that I shouldn’t be here. Not alone.

My hand went to my hip, to the spot where I used to carry a sidearm. But that had been a point of contention—too aggressive, Ray had said. Too much, for someone with my “presence.” Now all I had was the hunting knife strapped to my thigh.

I sighed, low and bitter, and backed away from the site.

The sun was already starting to dip behind the trees. Shadows stretched long across the forest floor. I climbed back onto the ATV and turned it toward the trailhead.

…

The ride back was slower. The air felt heavier. The woods too still.

Then I heard it—faint, far off. A sound like footsteps, but wrong. Not boots. Not hooves. Something uneven. Wet. Like hands slapping the ground.

I stopped the ATV and listened.

Nothing.

I started moving again, faster now, eyes flicking to the trees.

Then came the cry.

It echoed through the forest—long, low, and mournful. Not human. Not animal. Something in between. It made my skin crawl.

The ATV sputtered.

I cursed, tapped the throttle. The engine coughed, then died.

“Well fuck,” I muttered, climbing off.

The forest was silent again. Too silent.

I slung my pack over my shoulder, tightened my grip on the knife, and started walking.

The woods were darker now. The sun had slipped behind the hills, and the trees stood like sentinels, black against the bruised sky.

I walked fast, boots crunching frostbitten leaves. My breath came in short bursts, fogging the air. The knife in my hand felt small. Insufficient.

Behind me, the sounds continued.

Not footsteps. Not exactly.

A wet, slapping rhythm. Uneven. Like something dragging itself forward. Like hands.

I didn’t look back.

I knew better.

The trail curved, and I saw the faint glow of the office porch light through the trees. Relief surged—but it was thin, brittle.

The sounds grew louder.

I stopped.

The forest was silent again. No wind. No birds. Just the thud of my heart.

Then the cry came.

A long, low wail—mournful and wrong. It echoed through the trees, vibrating in my chest.

The hairs on my neck rose.

I turned.

Just for a second.

In the dark, between the trunks, I saw it.

A pale figure—white, torn, hunched low to the ground. It moved in a way that defied sense, limbs bent wrong, head lolling. It didn’t walk. It didn’t crawl. It propelled itself, jerking forward like a puppet with tangled strings.

I gasped and ran.

I sprinted the last stretch, knife clutched tight, lungs burning. I burst through the office door and slammed it shut, locking it.

Ray stood from his desk, startled. “Jesus, Hollis—what happened?”

I leaned against the wall, panting.

“There’s something out there,” I said.

Ray stared at me. “What kind of something?”

I shook my head. “I don’t know. But I’m bringing my sidearm from now on.”

Ray nodded slowly.

We didn’t speak much after that. Just packed up in silence, checked the windows, and stepped out into the cold together. I scanned the tree line as we walked to our trucks.

The woods watched back.

…

By the time I pulled into the driveway, the sky was ink-black and the mist had returned, curling low around the porch steps. The house lights glowed warm through the windows. I sat in the truck for a moment, gripping the wheel, before finally stepping out.

Inside, the smell of mushrooms and thyme wrapped around me like a blanket. Jules stood at the stove, ladling soup into two bowls. Her beautiful pink hair was pulled into a loose bun, wisps curling around her face in the steam. She turned when I came in, her eyes narrowing.

“You’re late,” she said gently. “And you look like hell.”

I dropped my bag by the door and kicked off my boots. “I’m fine.”

She raised an eyebrow.

We sat at the kitchen table, the cats weaving between our legs. I wrapped my hands around the warm bowl, but didn’t eat.

Jules waited.

Finally, I spoke. “I saw something. Out past Trail 9. A wrecked campsite. Same tracks I saw this morning—like handprints, dragging through the mud. And then… something followed me back. I heard it. I saw it.”

She didn’t interrupt. Just listened, her spoon paused halfway to her mouth.

“It was pale,” I said. “Torn up. Moving wrong. Like it didn’t have legs. Like it was pulling itself.”

The silence stretched.

Jules set her spoon down and leaned back in her chair, eyes distant. “You said it moved on its hands?”

I nodded.

She stood abruptly and left the room. I heard the soft clack of keys from the office down the hall, the creak of the old desk chair. I stayed at the table, staring into my soup, the warmth of the house suddenly feeling fragile.

When Jules returned, she was holding a thin folder and a printout. Her face was pale.

“I think I know what you saw,” she said.

I looked up.

“There’s an old story,” Jules began, sitting down again. “Not something people talk about anymore. Not in town. Not even in the library archives unless you know where to look.”

She slid the paper across the table.

“Her name was Maribeth Crane. Lived up in the hills, near where Trail 9 runs now. She was a healer, a midwife, and by all accounts, a good woman. Helped folks who couldn’t afford doctors. Took in strays. Kept to herself.”

Jules hesitated.

“Then there was an accident. No one knows exactly what happened. Some say she was attacked. Others say she fell into a ravine. But she was broken after that. Couldn’t walk upright. Moved on her hands, dragging her body behind her.”

My stomach twisted.

“They say the town turned on her,” Jules continued. “Called her cursed. Said she brought sickness. Said she was unnatural. She lived the rest of her life alone in the woods. Died out there, too. Some say she never left.”

She looked at me carefully.

“There’s more. People say her ghost doesn’t just haunt the woods. It… attaches. To people. Picks someone. Follows them. Watches. And once it’s chosen you, it doesn’t stop.”

I stared at the paper. A grainy photo of a woman with tired eyes and a crooked smile. The caption read: *Maribeth Crane, 1932.*

“No one says her name anymore,” Jules said softly. “Not around here. Folks are too superstitious. They just call her ‘the thing in the trees.’”

I looked at her. “You believe this?”

She didn’t answer right away. Then: “I believe you saw something. And I believe this place remembers pain.”

Outside, the wind picked up. The porch creaked.

I reached for Jules’s hand.

…

The next morning, Jules was quiet. She made coffee, fed the cats, and sat at the table with her laptop open. I watched her from the doorway.

“You okay?” I asked.

She didn’t look up. “I found something else.”

I stepped closer.

“There’s a pattern,” Jules said. “Every few decades. Someone sees it. Feels it. Starts hearing things. Then they disappear.”

My throat tightened. “Disappear how?”

“No one knows. They just… vanish. Sometimes their animals go first. Sometimes their partners. But it always starts with the tracks.”

She turned the laptop toward me. A scanned newspaper clipping. *Local Woman Missing After Strange Reports in Woods.*

The photo was grainy. But I recognized the woman’s eyes. Wide. Haunted.

“She said it followed her,” Jules whispered. “Said she felt it watching. Said she dreamed about it.”

I stepped back.

“I think it’s chosen you,” Jules said.

…

That night, the house felt wrong.

The radiator hissed too loud. The cats wouldn’t settle. One by one, they slunk into the bedroom, ears flat, tails puffed. I sat on the edge of the bed, lacing my boots.

I’d already pulled the water gun from the hall closet—bright green plastic, filled with holy water from a dusty bottle labeled *St. Jude’s, 2009*. A relic from my ghost-hunting days, back when I thought hauntings were stories and salt was just seasoning.

Jules stood in the doorway, pale and silent, holding a flashlight in one hand and a box of rock salt in the other.

We didn’t speak.

Then the porch creaked.

The cats hissed in unison, backing into corners, fur bristling.

A low scraping sound moved along the siding. Then the unmistakable sound of something climbing—slow, deliberate, unnatural.

I stepped into the hallway just as the living room window slid open with a soft click.

It came through.

Twisted. Pale. Its skin hung in tatters, like wet paper clinging to bone. Its arms were too long, elbows bent backward, fingers splayed like broken twigs. It moved on its hands, dragging the rest of its body behind, spine arching and collapsing with each lurch.  Its face was a ruin—half collapsed, half grinning. One eye socket empty. The other wide and gleaming.

It turned toward Jules.

She froze, flashlight trembling in her grip.

The creature crept closer, its breath rattling like wind through dead leaves.

The cats shrieked and scattered.

“Hey,” I said.

The thing stopped.

Its head twisted toward me, neck cracking. That grin widened, impossibly.

“I know you’re here for me,” I said, voice steady. “You picked me.”

It stared.

“I know what they did to you,” I said. “I know what it’s like to be twisted by other people’s fear. To be hated for how you move through the world.”

The leer faltered.

“But I’m not afraid of you,” I said. “And you don’t get to have me.”

I nodded once.

Jules raised the water gun and fired.

The stream hit the creature square in the chest. It screamed—a sound like metal tearing, like wind howling through a broken throat. Its body convulsed, limbs flailing, skin blistering where the water touched.

It scrambled backward, shrieking, and hurled itself through the open window, vanishing into the night with a final, echoing wail.

Silence fell.

The cats crept back in, wide-eyed but unharmed.

Jules and I stood in the center of the room, breathing hard.

Then she said, “Salt?”

“Salt,” I confirmed.

We worked in silence, pouring a ring around the house, every window, every door. The night air was sharp, but the stars were clear.

When we finished, we stood on the porch, side by side.

Jules looked at me. “You okay?”

I nodded. “She picked the wrong bitch.”

She smiled, tired and fierce. “Damn right she did.”

And behind us, the house breathed easy again.",0,1761685471.0,nosleep,0,0.5,False

The area has EVERYTHING: turquoise cenotes, ancient temples, colorful towns, and the kind of food that’ll make you fall in love instantly.

Here my go-to picks for a perfect first adventure:

✨***Cenotes (cee – ee – en – oh – tee – ee – ess)***  
You can’t come to Yucatán and not jump into one of these magical sinkholes. My favorites? *Cenote Ik Kil* (stunning) and *Cenote Oxman* (pretty and way more chill).

✨***Mayan ruins***  
*Chichén Itzá* is a must if it’s your first time. It’s one of the New Seven Wonders of the World! 

✨***Of course, Valladolid***  
This little town has such a cozy, colorful charm. You can grab an iced coffee, explore the pastel streets, and pop into a local cenote. It’s an aesthetic vibe.

✨***Las Coloradas***  
Wanna see something wild and natural? Las Coloradas is where it’s at, pink lagoons, flamingos, and pure magic!

✨***Last but definitely not least… the food!***  
Try *cochinita pibil* or *panuchos* from a local spot. You’ll thank me later.



Pro bono tip: If you want the classic “It's my first time” combo, I’d say go for **Chichén Itzá + a cenote + Valladolid**. It’s a perfect mix of culture, adventure, and just enough chill to make you fall in love with this place.

So… which one would you go for first? the ruins, the cenotes, or the food? Let me know! 🤔🤭",1,1761685190.0,MexicoAdventureTrips,0,0.67,False
1oilamb,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1oilamb/wedding_saturday/,Wedding Saturday,"So my wedding is Saturday and I’m anxious about the dress code. We put cocktail attire on our invite. Our wedding is at a barn that hosts events. Outdoor ceremony and dinner but dance floor, bar, cocktail time is inside the barn. 

We don’t have a full open bar because our venue requires we bring the booze and that would have been difficult. But we have a signature whiskey drink, tequila drink, vodka drink and gin drink + extra mixers so people have many options. We also have red wine, white wine, Prosecco, multiple beers, and high noons. There will be tea, coffee, regular water, and spindrifts for those who don’t drink. 

Cocktail hour is a 5 ft charcuterie table. Our buffet is short ribs, Hawaiian teriyaki chicken, risotto and very flavorful grilled veggies. My fiancé made 300 macarons, 100 cookies, 150 mini cheesecakes, and a big wedding cake. He’s an amazing baker so it will be delicious! 

Was cocktail too much? Should we send a message and change it? I’m hoping to ease my anxiety but we will see. 😂",6,1761685150.0,weddingplanning,14,1.0,False

1oil8di,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oil8di/my_25m_girlfriend_24fs_mom_broke_us_up/,My (25M) girlfriend (24F)’s mom broke us up.,"Some backstory, this girl was my first love, and I was hers. I lost my virginity to her. We dated Junior year summer into Senior year of High School all the way until 3 months into her being in college. She went to a fashion school in New York and wanted to stay together so I came with her, knowing I wasn’t going to any college and was just going to figure out my own path out there with her. We had the best relationship, we would always want to spend more time together and nothing ever felt like enough. We were totally and completely head over heels in love. 

Long story short we started fighting in the last month of being together which led to us having a mutual breakup, if we really wanted to we could’ve stayed together, but I think we were both over fighting so much and needed some time apart. 

This was my first love and the girl I lost my virginity to, I figured I’ll move on and get back out there because I thought every relationship would be just as good if not better than that one, and I had only slept with one girl. A few months had passed and I had a situationship with this other girl on and off for about a year, I could never commit because I was comparing everything to her, so eventually it ended. 

She ended up texting me one day after that and invited me over to her house. We talked and had a great time, she’s always been my best friend and we get along more than I’ve ever had before with anyone. I think I tried to kiss her at the end of the night and she stopped it and said she was in the beginning stages of seeing someone else. She invited me to go thrift shopping with her the next morning, and I overslept. I figured it was for the best as she was seeing someone else anyway. We didn’t talk for a few months after that.

We met up a few more times over a month or two period. Slept together a few times. Had some good times together, but she was still on and off with her boyfriend (apparently because of me she would go on breaks with him because she wasn’t over me yet) and I was also in contact with another girl, but it wasn’t anything remotely serious. She saw that the girl texted me in the morning after we had slept together. I replied that we weren’t exclusive, which was an immature response, but hey she was kind of doing the same thing. After that day we pretty much stopped talking.

I tried to get back out there again, settled for a girl that I knew I wasn’t in love with, but still got along with. My ex texted me asking to get some coffee or lunch or something and I replied that I have a new girlfriend now so I couldn’t. That was the last text I got sent and my relationship went on for 4 years, much longer than I was together with my first girlfriend. Throughout those years my ex girlfriend had moved to LA and I stayed in New York. In this relationship, I must have stalked my ex girlfriends instagram hundreds of times, could never get her out of my head and nothing ever lived up to how I felt for her. It got to a point in my relationship where me talking about her and bringing her up became the biggest problem we had. I think she was also jealous of her beauty and success. 

Come around to last christmas break, I went home to California for the first time in years. I was scheduled to be there for 3 weeks. In the first few days my girlfriend broke up with me over the phone and to be honest, I wasn’t phased in the slightest. I was stuck in that relationship and her breaking up with me instantly made me realize how stuck I really was. I was simply just friends with her, with the label of being boyfriend and girlfriend. That being said we still were together for 4 years, living together for 3 of them. 

3 days after she broke up with me, I was back home and going to a bar with my friends. I had two of my friends come up to me and let me know that my ex girlfriend (the one I had always been in love with) was there. Keep in mind I kind of figured this girl hated me or didn’t want to see me because it had been so long and we didn’t really end things on great terms. Either way, I had had just enough drinks that night to where I didn’t really care and had enough confidence to go over and say hi to her. I was walking around and looking for her, keep in mind this bar had over 150 people jam packed like sardines so it was hard to spot her. 

Once I finally did, it was like the entire room went quiet, and the spotlight was on us. Still, I figured she didn’t want to talk to me so I kind of just said hi and small talked for 30 seconds and then I walked out of the bar. I was outside now and there was a line of 40 people to even get into the bar past the bouncer. I realized that I wanted to keep talking to her so I tried to go back inside and cut the line. The bouncer was cool enough to let me back in after some convincing, and turns out she was walking around looking for me. We ran into each other again, small talked for a sec and I asked her if she wanted to talk outside and catch up. We ended up walking 5 minutes down to the beach and must have talked for an hour and a half. It was going so well. She eventually got cold and asked me to come back to her house. We got back and talked and talked and talked catching up until it was 6am. At the end of the night we started kissing and we slept together. This was the start of our relationship again. We got back together. I went back to New York, moved all my stuff out, and moved back in with my parents a few weeks later. 

The relationship this time around was 100 times better than our last relationship. I found out in the time we were broken up while I was stalking her instagram she was selling vintage clothes at a flea market that my dad is frequent at. She talked to my dad multiple times saying she missed me and she’ll always love me, even being 10 feet away from her current boyfriend then. She had felt all the things I felt while we were apart. I found out she had cried to her parents countless times saying her boyfriend isn’t anything like me and she missed me. She even had another boyfriend after him and felt the same way. Anyway, the relationship this time around was so amazing. I moved into her guest house she was living in at her dads house and we were finally able to spend all our time together. It made us slack on getting jobs for a long time, but we were in love and didn’t care. We had so much fun together everyday for 8 months up until her dad was selling the house. We couldn’t stay there anymore so we ended up moving in with her mom. 

Her mom is the type of lady that was cheated on her husband (my gf’s dad) when she was 26. She didn’t trust any men after that and didn’t really date at all. She thinks all men are evil and narcisists because she’s had a bad experience. She also doesn’t have any friends and can’t keep a friend because she’s a very bitter woman that says a lot of backhanded compliments and doesn’t like people that don’t agree with her conspiracy theory beliefs. I won’t get into those but she has always tried to force them on us and change our beliefs. Her mom also goes to a psychic a few times a week for the past several years. She’s the type of person to read a fake article on the internet and make it her whole personality and force it onto whoever’s around. Even so, my girlfriend has a pretty much non-existant father who just pays for things for her to show his love but is never actually there for her. So her mom is her everything, she listens to her and takes her advice because that’s all she has.

She has expressed that she knows her mom can be crazy and annoying and she’s also had fallings-out with her mom that led to them not talking for years to the point where the mom was so stubborn that she wouldn’t apologize for anything and she just wanted her mom back so she caved. I get it, it’s all she had. Anyway, we moved in to her mom’s house and there were a ton of backhanded compliments towards me and it didn’t make me feel good. We also didn’t have jobs, which is where her dad was in the picture. Giving her a credit card to spend on anything she wanted, so she willingly used it for both of us. We’d get some of our own money here and there and spend it on each other, but mostly it was her dad’s money, which he didn’t really care about how much she ever spent.

 It was an issue, but not that big of an issue. When we moved in with her mom, I guess my gf told her about how she had been using his card and I haven’t been paying for much. Her mom threw a fit and was calling me a mooch and didn’t think I was right for her daughter. This led to me and my gf getting in a pretty big fight because she listens to her mom a lot and takes her advice. I was frustrated that this was brought up because I had just started my full-time job getting good money a few days prior. I thought it was incredibly poor timing for her mom to bring that up and lead us into a fight because of it. Either way, I was frustrated at the mom, but I love my gf so much that I went and had a solo talk with her mom about it. We talked for 45 minutes ot so and I thought it went well. 

My gf came back home while I was finishing talking to her mom and she was still upset about everything and our fight that day. Her mom saw that she was upset and immediately flipped a switch and started calling me a liar and a mooch. She made me grab all my things and leave and move out. I grabbed all my things and I could see my gf crying about all of this and I was apologizing and saying I was so sorry and the mom was overstepping her boundaries and speaking for her. Saying things like, “That doesn’t sound genuine at all” and things to make me sound worse than it was. Anyway I got my stuff and left. I felt very ganged up on.

I brought all my stuff back to my parents house and met them for dinner somewhere. In this time I sent about 6 super long multiple paragraph each texts apologizing and telling her how I felt and reminding her of all the good in our relationship. It was truly very nice text messages. I didn’t get one response back. The next morning, I found out I was blocked on everything from my gf. I couldn’t contact her at all. So I went and bought some nice flowers for her and was waiting at her house until she got home. She was on a walk with her mom or something because they both arrived back at the house at the same time. I was trying to apologize for everything and the mom wouldn’t even let her speak, she just spoke up for her saying she doesn’t want your flowers and she’ll call the police on me if i ever come back and she’ll get a restraining order on me. She also grabbed my flowers and threw them in my car forcefully when I was leaving. I don’t know how this all got to be like this. Her mom convinced her I was the worst guy in the world and convinced her to block me on everything, when in reality, her mom was the one that made all of this happen and led us to breaking up. 

I don’t know what to do. It’s been 4 days since this happened and she hasn’t contacted me at all. I can’t contact her or go to her house even if I wanted to. The simple answer is my gf should have been talking for herself and making her own decisions, but I also feel for her that she has a tough family life and listens to her crazy mom. I don’t feel like I got my closure at all because I couldn’t even say anything to her. I don’t even want closure, I just want her back. None of this would’ve happened if we never moved in with her mom. I’ve been working everyday at my job and been making good money and I can’t even pay for everything for her because her mom caused a fight that I don’t pay for anything literally 1 day before I got my first paycheck. My gf and I have had our fair share of fights and arguments, but at the end of the day we always came to a resolution no matter what and we were always good. Her mom is in her ear convincing her of things that aren’t even true. 

What do you think I should do in this situation. I know I should let her realize it for herself that her mom is insane and she shouldn’t listen to her, but I’m going crazy without her. She’s my best friend and the love of my life. We talked about marriage and kids and our future multiple times a week for our entire relationship. I don’t understand how this happened. Would love some advice, sorry that was longer than I expected to write. ",1,1761685002.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

At the plant there were like 7 layers between us. Got married in a few months

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

He wants another baby and keeps pushing me very hard for it. But I told him I am not having sex with him without birth control. For now I just don't want to do it anyway. And we were fighting one evening because he spankd our toddler. He was having a meeting with his subordinates and our son kept pulling his arm to give him milk from the fridge. Husband kept pushing him away and told him he is busy. My kid started crying, husband had to mute his mic and his image for him is everything and he said that because of this, he looked bad. And he spankd him. However he says he did not push him to the floor. It was a tantrum

And we had an argument one night and he wanted to become intimate with me after it to make up and I didnt want and he kinda forced himself on me. He did not go until the end, he let me go though when I started screaming. He said he was not aware I dont want.",7,1761684902.0,ComfortLevelPod,4,1.0,False

Firstly I arrived at this university knowing just 1 person. A close friend of mine that happened to know her because they live close by. 1 month passed I would look at her, she would look at me but we never really interacted. One day we had a physics lab we sat next to each other and I decided to talk to her. We did our in-class work and had a assignment for next week. Unexpectedly she waited for me and wanted to meet me. We took a walk around campus for around an hour. Exchanged socials, i didn't think much since I wasn't really feeling anything about her. First week goes by we talk a little from dms she approached me and we started having small talks here and there or as we waited for public transport we would talk for a bit. Now second week comes by we had a common break from 10 till 12 I got a message she wanted to hang out. Again it was mostly about university and all that but slowly slowly we started learning eachother more and more. 


Another week goes by we continued to talk from Instagram but her response times would range from 2 minutes up until 30 hours. I mirrored her behavior to he fair since I didn't care at the time and then she started double texting to get my attention. Tuesday comes by and we have that common break (its the only time of the week we both have a common break). She Again reached out and wanted to hang out at a nearby coffee shop. This time it was different she Firstly showed me her presentation, then vented about different topics about her putting for class representative. She sat next to me leaned onto me and started talking about her problems and bullying she has been facing in class after a good 2 hours of talking and sharing opinions and seeing how much chemistry we had. I started actually taking a liking on this girl.


During that week I helped her socialize and speak to people in our lectures she never spoke to before. I also spread her opinions around class and managed to gather around 35 people to vote for her. Anyways she did end up losing but texted me the same day ""just know im greatful for everything you did ❤️❤️"".
After that her response times where immediate and would find every chance to be close to me.


Currently its exam week. She is stressed, im stressed everyone is. Her response times are 30-40 hours but sends me tik toks all day. Basically she finds chances to talk to me. Always smiles at me, stares at me when im not looking and her body language is open and different around me and gets closer to me than your average friend. She sends me big voice mails 10-15 minutes. Appreciates me because I understand her and vented how she was never really treated this way, having someone that isn't bored of her talking all day. She does have bad rumors going around in my class and that kind of hurts her.


Now what's the negatives you might ask. 2 days ago she started talking about a blue eyed boy that looks at her and she thinks she mightve took an interest. Then hit me with the ""Im here trying to do love but at the same time I don't want to do love."". Now I did try to hit her with the ""yeah I like a girl too"" card but she seemed a little unhinged about it. Didn't ask me any questions like who. She responded with ""I won't judge just tell me and ill see if I'll help.""


TL;DR I believe she seems me as a bestie/ friend but does invest alot of energy and wants to hang out 1 on 1. At the same time she compliments me and has this behavior.
Im confused on how to continue this and what is really going on. She seems intrested but has pretty on and off behavior. Does speak to me daily at university and we will talk for a lengthy amount of time in or out of class. On Instagram she will leave me on delivered for 1 or 2 days. But proceeds to send me tik toks and answer to mine back.

The driver called me asking for a PIN number before he could deliver this order. At first I thought it was a ploy to get me to come to the door (I usually wait until they drive away to grab it from the porch), but this guy seemed genuinely confused. I had my boyfriend come to the door with me and the guy showed me his phone with a timer asking him for a PIN to complete the order. I searched the Panera app, my email, everything for this PIN and I had nothing. The timer ran out, he was able to snap a pic and leave, but I'm still confused!

I have been using the delivery feature for years with minimal issue (besides the driver who delivered one singular cream cheese as my bagel, cream cheese, and coffee order bc the bagel I ordered ran out? Lol). I've had small mix ups with drinks or missing cookies, and have only called customer  service twice when I was missing a drink entirely and for the bagel issue. From what I read online this is usually for customers who either request it or have frequent complaints about missing orders, or for ""hand it to me"" orders. Obviously the latter makes sense here, but where the heck do I find this PIN?? I only ever order through the Panera app and I can't find anything about it there or when I click track order.

1oikzhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1oikzhe/i_need_help_advancing_this_talking_stage/,I need help advancing this talking stage,"Hello I'm a freshman in mechanical engineering so is she she is also in my classes and labs. 


Firstly I arrived at this university knowing just 1 person. A close friend of mine that happened to know her because they live close by. 1 month passed I would look at her, she would look at me but we never really interacted. One day we had a physics lab we sat next to each other and I decided to talk to her. We did our in-class work and had a assignment for next week. Unexpectedly she waited for me and wanted to meet me. We took a walk around campus for around an hour. Exchanged socials, i didn't think much since I wasn't really feeling anything about her. First week goes by we talk a little from dms she approached me and we started having small talks here and there or as we waited for public transport we would talk for a bit. Now second week comes by we had a common break from 10 till 12 I got a message she wanted to hang out. Again it was mostly about university and all that but slowly slowly we started learning eachother more and more. 


Another week goes by we continued to talk from Instagram but her response times would range from 2 minutes up until 30 hours. I mirrored her behavior to he fair since I didn't care at the time and then she started double texting to get my attention. Tuesday comes by and we have that common break (its the only time of the week we both have a common break). She Again reached out and wanted to hang out at a nearby coffee shop. This time it was different she Firstly showed me her presentation, then vented about different topics about her putting for class representative. She sat next to me leaned onto me and started talking about her problems and bullying she has been facing in class after a good 2 hours of talking and sharing opinions and seeing how much chemistry we had. I started actually taking a liking on this girl.


During that week I helped her socialize and speak to people in our lectures she never spoke to before. I also spread her opinions around class and managed to gather around 35 people to vote for her. Anyways she did end up losing but texted me the same day ""just know im greatful for everything you did ❤️❤️"".
After that her response times where immediate and would find every chance to be close to me.


Currently its exam week. She is stressed, im stressed everyone is. Her response times are 30-40 hours but sends me tik toks all day. Basically she finds chances to talk to me. Always smiles at me, stares at me when im not looking and her body language is open and different around me and gets closer to me than your average friend. She sends me big voice mails 10-15 minutes. Appreciates me because I understand her and vented how she was never really treated this way, having someone that isn't bored of her talking all day. She does have bad rumors going around in my class and that kind of hurts her.


Now what's the negatives you might ask. 2 days ago she started talking about a blue eyed boy that looks at her and she thinks she mightve took an interest. Then hit me with the ""Im here trying to do love but at the same time I don't want to do love."". Now I did try to hit her with the ""yeah I like a girl too"" card but she seemed a little unhinged about it. Didn't ask me any questions like who. She responded with ""I won't judge just tell me and ill see if I'll help.""


TL;DR I believe she seems me as a bestie/ friend but does invest alot of energy and wants to hang out 1 on 1. At the same time she compliments me and has this behavior.

A bit about me:

* I’m super into movies (especially psychological thrillers).
* Love a good read with coffee and music.
* I fancy travelling as much as i can, really love mountains.
* Big fan of humor, memes, and people who don’t take themselves too seriously.

If you’re around my age and this sounds like your kind of energy, DM or drop a comment!

Please find below another list of ten upcoming indie metroidvania games that may have flown under your radar!

As always, a video showcasing the games can be watched by following this link: [https://youtu.be/q8aNpFc2mbs](https://youtu.be/q8aNpFc2mbs)

**For those who do not wish to watch the video, I cover the below titles:**

[**Forgotten Eras:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3423760/Forgotten_Eras/) This game places you in the role of Ivan, a young hero on a mission to save his world from a malady inflicted upon it by a group of shamans! Greatly inspired by Slavic folklore, the game’s setting is populated by a variety of myths and legends that stem from that culture, including the enigmatic Domovoy and the terrifying Baba Yaga, infusing its worldbuilding with a deep sense of tradition. Ivan himself boasts a very impressive move-set, especially when it comes to his acrobatic abilities, which will definitely come in handy given the numerous platforming gauntlets he will have to face. That being said, combat is also impressive in its own right, allowing you to take on enemies in close quarters while using a legendary sword named Kladenets, pick them off from afar by utilizing your bow and even summoning the spirit of the Grey Wolf in order to tear everything apart, all of which are complemented by a runic power system that will allow you to unlock new skills and develop unique strategies depending on the foes you’ll be facing. Of special note here is the fact that Forgotten Eras features an in-depth choice system that will greatly influence how the story will unfold, effectively making each playthrough a unique experience depending on the decisions that you’ll make. Forgotten Eras has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC!

[**Higher: The Last Dream:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3722970/Higher_The_Last_Dream/) This one aims to capture the platforming intensity of the legendary Celeste! In a universe between Reality and Dreams, you are Starlight, a hero of light who awakens in darkness while devoid of memories and decides to ascend toward the skies in order to make sense of the surrounding obscurity. The game takes a deeply psychological approach to its narrative which also informs its setting, with the various dreamlike biomes you’ll get to traverse representing a traumatic experience or repressed emotion you have to uncover and overcome. There’s also an intense emphasis on fast-paced combat and exploration, with, both, traversal and battle movement being snappy and delirious, resulting in some intense acrobatic nightmares as well as explosive boss-battles against the colossal villains lurking across the realm. Higher: The Last Dream is expected to come out sometime in 2027, and has been confirmed for PC!

[**MONUMENTUM:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3931170/MONUMENTUM/) Definitely the most novel metroidvania on this list, as well as one of the most unique takes on the genre in general! Drawing intense inspiration from pinball, MONUMENTUM will have you play as a small rolling square as you attempt to reach the top of a vast setting comprised of long-dormant mechanisms. Each room you’ll get to traverse here will practically be a platforming puzzle in which you’ll have to make use of a variety of movement-inducing mechanisms that will fling, propel and magnetize you as you try your best to reach the top of this gauntlet, essentially making the whole thing an elaborate pinball machine! It’s also of note that MONUMENTUM features little to no handholding as it adopts a very much minimalistic mentality when it comes to providing information by having no tutorials or user interface options present, effectively encouraging players to experiment and discover everything by themselves! With more than 100 challenges to conquer, this one looks like it’s going to be a treat for lovers of tough-as-nails platforming! MONUMENTUM is expected to come out on the 31^(st) of October, 2025, and has been confirmed for PC!  

[**Runeblight:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3714270/Runeblight/) An unholy union of the metroidvania, soulslike and retro FPS genres! Welcome to the unwelcoming Vilaura, a steampunk fantasy world that’s on the brink of ruination as a result of a plague that has been unleashed by powerful forces which conspire to bring the land to an end! Thankfully, their malicious plan will not go smoothly because of you, a powerful warrior on a mission to save Vilaura with the help of a ridiculous amount of artillery at your disposal. From grenade launchers, shotguns and crossbows, all the way to wands and daggers, Runeblight will provide you with a solid array of armaments in order to obliterate your foes in true boomer shooter fashion, all while exploring an intricately interconnected world full of hidden paths and ancient secrets. Your firepower is complemented by the use of runic magic, which allows you to wield a variety of special skills, some of which are aimed toward combat while others meant for traversal, with the latter giving you access to previously unreachable places in true metroidvania fashion! Navigating the broken world of Vilaura will be made easier by a fast travel system in the form of Hexaltars, which will allow you to quickly teleport across the map! Runeblight has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC! 

[**Croakspire:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3744870/Croakspire/) Prepare to defend yourself with your tongue in a game that has you playing as a frog that must explore a monster-infested castle, which is the only way that initial statement would be appropriate in any way, shape or form! Croakspire is very much inspired by Igavanias, with our amphibian protagonist being capable of leveling up through combat in order to increase his statistics, as well as having a solid collection of equippable tongue-whips, accessories and secondary weapons at his disposal to take down his foes, whom include some formidable bosses! Croakspire is expected to come out sometime during the fourth quarter of 2025, and has been confirmed for PC!

[**This is Fine: Maximum Cope:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229980/This_Is_Fine_Maximum_Cope/) A metroidvania based on the incredibly memable creation of cartoonist KC Green, images of which you must have seen somewhere online at some point in the form of the coffee-sipping dog - also known as Question Hound - amidst flaming chaos. Here you’ll get to traverse said dog’s stress and anxiety-infested mind in order to face its inner demons, with every biome being the embodiment of a diverse range of everyday worries that we all face and must deal with constantly, including fear, regret and failure. Defeating each biome’s boss will award you with a new ability in order to access previously inaccessible areas, most of which will be hiding a variety of quirky collectibles in line with the tone of the comic. This is Fine: Maximum Cope is expected to come out sometime in March of 2026, and has been confirmed for PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch as well as the Xbox Series X and Series S!

[**Paradox Patrol:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3736090/Paradox_Patrol/) Wield the blaster of Officer Conway, a member of the Paradox Patrol, who is sent on a journey to a distant planet in order to investigate a mysterious disturbance that was detected in the space-time continuum. What starts as a routine mission quickly spirals out of control as Conway finds himself struggling to survive amidst the chaos of shifting dimensions of reality and the monstrous creatures that inhabit them! There are two main standout features when it comes to Paradox Patrol. The first one is the game’s boast as the first 360-degree side-scroller, which is expected to allow increased control when it comes to precision aiming and will hopefully work as advertised since shooting is an integral part of the experience and does looks incredibly fun! The second is the very nature of the setting itself, with the constantly changing dimensions bringing forth unpredictable threats and obstacles that you will have to overcome by thinking on your feet and making use of the various traversal mechanics at your disposal, such as the dash and grappling hook. On a last note, bosses are expected to give you a proper challenge due to their unique AI that will be able to adapt to your playstyle, which, in turn, will force you to do the same to theirs! Paradox Patrol has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC!   

[**Alruna: End of History:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3440260/Alruna_End_of_History/) The sequel to the incredibly well-received Alruna and the Necro-Industrialists which came out back in September of 2024! The world has been hollowed out by the Necro-Industrialists, with the only promise of salvation being Elysium, a place of enlightenment that lies just beyond Heaven’s Gate! You’re once again thrust into the role of Alruna, a flower nymph, who must now face off against an increasing number of grotesque and masochistic foes as she tries to find her way to the promised land! Alruna has a solid number of abilities at her disposal, such as super jumps, hyper dashes and the Blossom Blaster, the latter of which allows her to shoot at enemies and also bounce off of her projectiles for an extra boost. On top of that, our girl can find elemental power ups that endow her with the powers of fire, water and lightning, all of which also unlock special skills related to combat and traversal. The game features a total of four large temples that you will need to conquer, with the whole setting connected by a sprawling overworld. In addition, you can expect numerous mini-games and secrets to uncover, including whole biomes that may be hiding just behind a small rock that conceals their entrance! Alruna: End of History is expected to come out sometime during the first quarter of 2026, and has been confirmed for PC!

[**GNAW:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306490/GNAW/) A metroidvania with an endearingly Jurassic theme! In a world populated by anthropomorphic dinosaurs, New Dino City stands tall as the heart of saurian civilization, a place where creatures of different species co-exist harmoniously…or at least used to, since something has upset the natural order of things, turning once peaceful critters into aggressive predators. You are Mack Ripley, an everyday dinosaur living his life before getting tangled into a scientific accident that grants him unnatural powers, which he decides to use in order to get to the bottom of the mystery that is the recent rise in creature aggression. Mack will have a good number of abilities that he will be able to gain during his adventure, which you will be able to mix and match in order to develop your own playstyle depending on how you want to approach combat, whether that is with a basis on melee, ranged or something in between. Fighting aside, exploration appears to be a central, as well as fun, experience here, since New Dino City gives way to dozens of regions that you will be able to investigate, with many of its dark corners hiding strange allies and twisted villains with stories of their own. Of special note here is the game’s art-style, which reminds me of my favorite 90s cartoons and gives the whole endeavor a nostalgic vibe! GNAW is expected to come out sometime in 2026, and has been confirmed for PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch as well as Xbox consoles!

**Honorable Mention:** Before we get to the final game, I do wish to give an honorable mention to [**Skinwalker**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3086670/SKINWALKER/), a violent hack and slash action platformer that is probably not a metroidvania - **even though Steam has tagged it as such** \- but nevertheless looks like something fans of the genre might enjoy! You are the father of a girl afflicted by a terminal illness, and you’re at your wits end when it comes to finding a cure. That is, until you strike a deal with a mysterious creature that’s held captive in the research center where you work. The bargain is simple; help it escape and, in exchange, it will give you the cure you so desperately need. The catch? The creature is a Skinwalker that you will have to form a symbiotic relationship with in order to help it rip and tear its way through the facility. Skinwalker promises incredibly emotional and high stakes storytelling where each decision can bear grave consequences on the story’s outcome. As the two-fold character of the father and monster, you will have to carefully choose your approach when it comes to formulating your escape plan with as few casualties as possible, since the Skinwalker will not hesitate to mutilate anyone standing in its path and, unfortunately, most of those people are innocent. The problem is that the only way for you to strengthen yourself is to spill said innocent blood, which does unlock new upgrades and execution animations but is also related to the grave consequences mentioned previously, thus making the whole thing a series of impossible decisions that will hopefully lead to the saving of your child. The Skinwalker will also bring certain traversal abilities to the table which will allow you to navigate the facility, such as moving through air-ducts and smashing through walls, in addition to the combat capabilities that have already been referenced. Skinwalker is expected to come out sometime in 2026, and has been confirmed for PC!

[**Silent Planet: Elegy of a Dying World:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742920/Silent_Planet__Elegy_of_a_Dying_World/) A dark science fiction metroidvania title with elements of Cosmic Horror! The year is 2997. Somewhere beneath the ground of the planet Thulcandra lies a claustrophobic complex that’s rumored to hold the Angel’s Egg, an ancient artifact believed to be the source of all life in the universe. You take on the role of Apranik, a woman tasked with retrieving the Angel’s Egg from the bowels of the complex, a place now home to technological and biological horrors left behind by a civilization long gone. Silent Planet goes for an oppressive ambience, accentuating feelings of dread and solitude as you face eldritch horrors beyond your understanding. Thankfully, you’re anything but helpless as you have an array of melee and ranged psychokinetic attacks at your disposal, that can take down even the deadliest of foes when used efficiently. The game also adopts a dynamic approach in its exploration, since certain actions you take during your playthrough will influence the environment around you, something that could also denote to a degree of replayabilty value. I actually featured this game on my channel last summer, but decided to do so again since it recently received a proper trailer and updated release date timeframe, and was also renamed from Silent Planet to Silent Planet: Elegy of a Dying World, all of which I figured gave it the right to an encore. Silent Planet: Elegy of a Dying World is expected to come out sometime in the fourth quarter of 2026, and has been confirmed for PC!

Runeblight has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC! 

[**Croakspire:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3744870/Croakspire/) Prepare to defend yourself with your tongue in a game that has you playing as a frog that must explore a monster-infested castle, which is the only way that initial statement would be appropriate in any way, shape or form! Croakspire is very much inspired by Igavanias, with our amphibian protagonist being capable of leveling up through combat in order to increase his statistics, as well as having a solid collection of equippable tongue-whips, accessories and secondary weapons at his disposal to take down his foes, whom include some formidable bosses! Croakspire is expected to come out sometime during the fourth quarter of 2025, and has been confirmed for PC!

[**This is Fine: Maximum Cope:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229980/This_Is_Fine_Maximum_Cope/) A metroidvania based on the incredibly memable creation of cartoonist KC Green, images of which you must have seen somewhere online at some point in the form of the coffee-sipping dog - also known as Question Hound - amidst flaming chaos. Here you’ll get to traverse said dog’s stress and anxiety-infested mind in order to face its inner demons, with every biome being the embodiment of a diverse range of everyday worries that we all face and must deal with constantly, including fear, regret and failure. Defeating each biome’s boss will award you with a new ability in order to access previously inaccessible areas, most of which will be hiding a variety of quirky collectibles in line with the tone of the comic. This is Fine: Maximum Cope is expected to come out sometime in March of 2026, and has been confirmed for PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch as well as the Xbox Series X and Series S!

[**Paradox Patrol:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3736090/Paradox_Patrol/) Wield the blaster of Officer Conway, a member of the Paradox Patrol, who is sent on a journey to a distant planet in order to investigate a mysterious disturbance that was detected in the space-time continuum. What starts as a routine mission quickly spirals out of control as Conway finds himself struggling to survive amidst the chaos of shifting dimensions of reality and the monstrous creatures that inhabit them! There are two main standout features when it comes to Paradox Patrol. The first one is the game’s boast as the first 360-degree side-scroller, which is expected to allow increased control when it comes to precision aiming and will hopefully work as advertised since shooting is an integral part of the experience and does looks incredibly fun! The second is the very nature of the setting itself, with the constantly changing dimensions bringing forth unpredictable threats and obstacles that you will have to overcome by thinking on your feet and making use of the various traversal mechanics at your disposal, such as the dash and grappling hook. On a last note, bosses are expected to give you a proper challenge due to their unique AI that will be able to adapt to your playstyle, which, in turn, will force you to do the same to theirs! Paradox Patrol has no release date as of yet, but has been confirmed for PC!   

[**Alruna: End of History:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3440260/Alruna_End_of_History/) The sequel to the incredibly well-received Alruna and the Necro-Industrialists which came out back in September of 2024! The world has been hollowed out by the Necro-Industrialists, with the only promise of salvation being Elysium, a place of enlightenment that lies just beyond Heaven’s Gate! You’re once again thrust into the role of Alruna, a flower nymph, who must now face off against an increasing number of grotesque and masochistic foes as she tries to find her way to the promised land! Alruna has a solid number of abilities at her disposal, such as super jumps, hyper dashes and the Blossom Blaster, the latter of which allows her to shoot at enemies and also bounce off of her projectiles for an extra boost. On top of that, our girl can find elemental power ups that endow her with the powers of fire, water and lightning, all of which also unlock special skills related to combat and traversal. The game features a total of four large temples that you will need to conquer, with the whole setting connected by a sprawling overworld. In addition, you can expect numerous mini-games and secrets to uncover, including whole biomes that may be hiding just behind a small rock that conceals their entrance! Alruna: End of History is expected to come out sometime during the first quarter of 2026, and has been confirmed for PC!

[**GNAW:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306490/GNAW/) A metroidvania with an endearingly Jurassic theme! In a world populated by anthropomorphic dinosaurs, New Dino City stands tall as the heart of saurian civilization, a place where creatures of different species co-exist harmoniously…or at least used to, since something has upset the natural order of things, turning once peaceful critters into aggressive predators. You are Mack Ripley, an everyday dinosaur living his life before getting tangled into a scientific accident that grants him unnatural powers, which he decides to use in order to get to the bottom of the mystery that is the recent rise in creature aggression. Mack will have a good number of abilities that he will be able to gain during his adventure, which you will be able to mix and match in order to develop your own playstyle depending on how you want to approach combat, whether that is with a basis on melee, ranged or something in between. Fighting aside, exploration appears to be a central, as well as fun, experience here, since New Dino City gives way to dozens of regions that you will be able to investigate, with many of its dark corners hiding strange allies and twisted villains with stories of their own. Of special note here is the game’s art-style, which reminds me of my favorite 90s cartoons and gives the whole endeavor a nostalgic vibe! GNAW is expected to come out sometime in 2026, and has been confirmed for PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch as well as Xbox consoles!

Honorable Mention: Before we get to the final game, I do wish to give an honorable mention to [**Skinwalker**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3086670/SKINWALKER/), a violent hack and slash action platformer that is probably not a metroidvania - even though Steam has tagged it as such - but nevertheless looks like something fans of the genre might enjoy! You are the father of a girl afflicted by a terminal illness, and you’re at your wits end when it comes to finding a cure. That is, until you strike a deal with a mysterious creature that’s held captive in the research center where you work. The bargain is simple; help it escape and, in exchange, it will give you the cure you so desperately need. The catch? The creature is a Skinwalker that you will have to form a symbiotic relationship with in order to help it rip and tear its way through the facility. Skinwalker promises incredibly emotional and high stakes storytelling where each decision can bear grave consequences on the story’s outcome. As the two-fold character of the father and monster, you will have to carefully choose your approach when it comes to formulating your escape plan with as few casualties as possible, since the Skinwalker will not hesitate to mutilate anyone standing in its path and, unfortunately, most of those people are innocent. The problem is that the only way for you to strengthen yourself is to spill said innocent blood, which does unlock new upgrades and execution animations but is also related to the grave consequences mentioned previously, thus making the whole thing a series of impossible decisions that will hopefully lead to the saving of your child. The Skinwalker will also bring certain traversal abilities to the table which will allow you to navigate the facility, such as moving through air-ducts and smashing through walls, in addition to the combat capabilities that have already been referenced. Skinwalker is expected to come out sometime in 2026, and has been confirmed for PC! 

[**Silent Planet: Elegy of a Dying World:**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742920/Silent_Planet__Elegy_of_a_Dying_World/) A dark science fiction metroidvania title with elements of Cosmic Horror! The year is 2997. Somewhere beneath the ground of the planet Thulcandra lies a claustrophobic complex that’s rumored to hold the Angel’s Egg, an ancient artifact believed to be the source of all life in the universe. You take on the role of Apranik, a woman tasked with retrieving the Angel’s Egg from the bowels of the complex, a place now home to technological and biological horrors left behind by a civilization long gone. Silent Planet goes for an oppressive ambience, accentuating feelings of dread and solitude as you face eldritch horrors beyond your understanding. Thankfully, you’re anything but helpless as you have an array of melee and ranged psychokinetic attacks at your disposal, that can take down even the deadliest of foes when used efficiently. The game also adopts a dynamic approach in its exploration, since certain actions you take during your playthrough will influence the environment around you, something that could also denote to a degree of replayabilty value. I actually featured this game on my channel last summer, but decided to do so again since it recently received a proper trailer and updated release date timeframe, and was also renamed from Silent Planet to Silent Planet: Elegy of a Dying World, all of which I figured gave it the right to an encore. Silent Planet: Elegy of a Dying World is expected to come out sometime in the fourth quarter of 2026, and has been confirmed for PC!

Kanade > Afton in FRI.

Kanade > Afton in EM SM and MF: She was able to maintain her kind and caring facade throughout Setuka’s class trial when they were getting close she only stopped after she was revealed as the culprit she endured years of abuse from her sister while still maintaining her mentality.

Kanade > Afton in FI: She memorised Iroha’s coffee schedule and used it to her advantage to remove her alibi she also adapted her guitar playing to synchronise perfectly with Hibiki’s singing during a party organized by Setuka, with an error margin of only 0.000001 seconds and got a perfect score in darts despite never playing it before.

Kanade > Afton in PC and DP: Her plan was far more thought out and detailed than Afton’s dittophobia plan she had a fake alibi, two scapegoats, and a setup where even if they voted for Hibiki or herself, the trial’s rules would let her win.

Kanade > Afton in CR and HR: She saw through Emma’s fake acting and at the age of 3-4 she was able to recognise she was superior to Hibiki in everything so Hibiki would abuse her.

Kanade > Afton in Prediction: She was able to predict she was in a virtual world through predictive reasoning.

Afton > Kanade in Memory.

Afton > Kanade in Potential.

Afton > Kanade in Experience.

Afton > Kanade in Overall Skill.

Afton > Kanade in CPI.

Afton > Kanade in PM.

Kanade > Afton in SI: She reasons in Yuri’s class trial that the culprit couldn’t have jumped off the bell tower due to its height, as the kinetic energy would have dislocated their shoulders upon landing.

Kanade > Afton in DM.

Kanade > Afton in PR: Was able to recognise the pattern of the dying messages from Kokoro represented each icicle as a girl helping her solve the class trial.

Kanade > Afton in Strategy: She would repeatedly murder Hibiki’s acquaintances to psychologically break her reducing her to the state of an obedient puppet starting with Hibiki’s dog Shiro she took a kitchen knife, butchered Shiro into pieces, and washed him down the drain to dispose of the evidence pushing Hibiki’s best friend Ayumi down a flight of stairs to cause her entire body to be paralysed for the rest of her life giving the middle-school teacher Hibiki had a crush on an extra dose of muscle relaxant, and burying him outside the school to dispose of the evidence killing the recording engineer, makeup coordinator, and manager for Hibiki’s band turning them into sushi to dispose of the evidence. She memorised Iroha’s coffee schedule and used it against her by drugging her to ensure she would have no alibi. She lured Setuka to the pool electrocuted her to knock her out and poured fake blood on her then lured Hibiki to Setuka to intentionally make her fall into a trance exploited this trance by using her to murder Setuka together so no matter what she would win unless the rules were bent.

Kanade > Afton in EU: During Kokoro’s Class Trial, she is able to deduce Emma’s entire motive for killing Kokoro, as well as Kokoro’s prior state and actions, from Emma’s own reactions and behavioural traits. During Yuri’s Class Trial, she recognizes Hajime’s guilt of killing Yuri by the tone of his voice. In Setuka’s class trial she deduced Syobai's thought process correctly psychoanalysing him.

Hello I'm a freshman in mechanical engineering so is she she is also in my classes and labs. 


Firstly I arrived at this university knowing just 1 person. A close friend of mine that happened to know her because they live close by. 1 month passed I would look at her, she would look at me but we never really interacted. One day we had a physics lab we sat next to each other and I decided to talk to her. We did our in-class work and had a assignment for next week. Unexpectedly she waited for me and wanted to meet me. We took a walk around campus for around an hour. Exchanged socials, i didn't think much since I wasn't really feeling anything about her. First week goes by we talk a little from dms she approached me and we started having small talks here and there or as we waited for public transport we would talk for a bit. Now second week comes by we had a common break from 10 till 12 I got a message she wanted to hang out. Again it was mostly about university and all that but slowly slowly we started learning eachother more and more. 


Another week goes by we continued to talk from Instagram but her response times would range from 2 minutes up until 30 hours. I mirrored her behavior to he fair since I didn't care at the time and then she started double texting to get my attention. Tuesday comes by and we have that common break (its the only time of the week we both have a common break). She Again reached out and wanted to hang out at a nearby coffee shop. This time it was different she Firstly showed me her presentation, then vented about different topics about her putting for class representative. She sat next to me leaned onto me and started talking about her problems and bullying she has been facing in class after a good 2 hours of talking and sharing opinions and seeing how much chemistry we had. I started actually taking a liking on this girl.


During that week I helped her socialize and speak to people in our lectures she never spoke to before. I also spread her opinions around class and managed to gather around 35 people to vote for her. Anyways she did end up losing but texted me the same day ""just know im greatful for everything you did ❤️❤️"".
After that her response times where immediate and would find every chance to be close to me.


Currently its exam week. She is stressed, im stressed everyone is. Her response times are 30-40 hours but sends me tik toks all day. Basically she finds chances to talk to me. Always smiles at me, stares at me when im not looking and her body language is open and different around me and gets closer to me than your average friend. She sends me big voice mails 10-15 minutes. Appreciates me because I understand her and vented how she was never really treated this way, having someone that isn't bored of her talking all day. She does have bad rumors going around in my class and that kind of hurts her.


Now what's the negatives you might ask. 2 days ago she started talking about a blue eyed boy that looks at her and she thinks she mightve took an interest. Then hit me with the ""Im here trying to do love but at the same time I don't want to do love."". Now I did try to hit her with the ""yeah I like a girl too"" card but she seemed a little unhinged about it. Didn't ask me any questions like who. She responded with ""I won't judge just tell me and ill see if I'll help.""


TL;DR I believe she seems me as a bestie/ friend but does invest alot of energy and wants to hang out 1 on 1. At the same time she compliments me and has this behavior.
Im confused on how to continue this and what is really going on. She seems intrested but has pretty on and off behavior. Does speak to me daily at university and we will talk for a lengthy amount of time in or out of class. On Instagram she will leave me on delivered for 1 or 2 days.

Me with so much respect and really gave me a great impression of the religion. I ended up doing my own research and decided to convert one year ago. The day I converted he was reaching out more and painting himself as a supportive best friend. He was married but assured me that he was just being supportive.

Things escalate to him asking to meet me since he wanted to vent about his life and it ended up with him waving me to get into his car to talk instead. He actually tried to kiss me and unzip my dress (which he ended up doing) before stopping and taking me back to my car. The experience destroyed me. When I doubted his intentions awhile back he made me feel stupid for suggesting anything nefarious and when I decided to trust him completely he broke it. 

We come from different cultures it was totally normal for someone like mine to see friends from the opposite gender for coffee and platonic meets. I understand from an Islamic perspective you can’t even be alone with another woman. 

This whole experience ruined my perception of the religion since i felt like the only reason he didn’t cross boundaries was bc I wasn’t religious and he was scared to touch me. The second I wore a hijab and converted i was treated worse. ",7,1761683526.0,islam,5,0.89,False

This happened last week and I have not talked to my sister since she told me this, she has sent me tiktoks here and there + called me once and have not responded at all. Last Wednesday we were hanging out and grabbing coffee together and I mentioned that I would like to have her and my other sisters +her daughter, my flower girl (10) be in the bridal suite with me and have all of us get ready. We were in the Starbucks line already ordered and she then says ""well what if i wanted to get ready with X"" (we will use that for the story, X is her partner.) I then told her that he isn't invited and that this was not discussed she kind of gave me a shocked look and made noises after like ugh and what to herself. She then added that its normal for people to get plus ones at a wedding and I said well I am not doing that cause i expected her to be with her daughter ( I have a super small family only immediate family and guests with their plus ones will be coming) she then said ""well who am i going to dance with"" and i mentioned her daughter which i assumed she was going to be with.. i mean where else is her daughter going to be besides with her cousins who will be there. she then said ""you know her, she's going to be elsewhere, then she said. ""man your wedding is going to be wack,  well don't be surprised when i leave to be with him"" while we're still in the line. I was not able to say much since were waiting for our order I told her that it was kind of fucked up that she's going to leave just to see him, I told her that i haven't even met him why would she assume he was invited to my wedding she then repeated herself and said that guests normally get a plus one and i repeated myself that i am not doing that since she has her daughter and every sister i have has a child that is with them with no partners have the same ""expectations"", her and her bf i think have been together for 5-6 months and have never met them at all. when we received our order we went straight to my house in straight silence. she tried to break the ice and i interreacted a bit but i was extremely upset and trying to collect my thoughts too. she had plans to be at my house and have her BF pick him up. it was very awkward and then after we started small talk and haven't talked to her since. I feel bad cause maybe I'm in the wrong for assuming she wouldn't want to invite anyone and be with her daughter. But I have not met this man once and i still don't think I will even till the wedding, I want my sister to come she's the one I'm closest too but I am extremely hurt that she told me my wedding is going to be wack and she's going to leave early if hes not invited.. She's basically choosing him over her own sister and that hurts alot..  But at the same time if she were to choose him over her own sister's wedding maybe I should cut contact.

I like to keep my apartment cold. I usually have at least a couple of windows open for fresh air, especially at night. I live in Seattle where the weather can be pretty chilly and sometimes my apartment gets a little too cold, even for me. I'll turn on the radiators but keep them low so they're not blasting heat. My kitchen doesn't have a radiator so it's usually pretty cold in there. I keep my coffee in a cabinet with no other food items, so they stay in a cool dark place.

My question is, can it be too cold for proper bean storage? If my inside temp is below 60°F at night (tbh I have no idea how cold it gets inside but assume probably much colder than 60° in my kitchen) is this bad for the bags? I keep all of my bags in the bags they come in zippered securely. I do have an airscape but I find it doesn't make that much of difference and I have way too many bags anyhow.

1oik9fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1oik9fn/boundaries_with_opposite_sex/,Boundaries with opposite sex,"Firstly I will start by my husband and I both grew up in a conservative Christian environment, we no longer ascribe to that, but I am sure the lens we were given still shapes our approach to the following situation. Secondly, my husband does not have a reputation of being faithful, but I do not want to hold the past against who he is now. 

Recently my husband started a new job and he has enjoyed making friends at work and they all enjoy hanging out when not working. I think this is a positive because he tends to be a workaholic if there isn’t a social scene to take part in. Nonetheless one of his colleagues is a female who has a boyfriend, so initially I didn’t feel intimidated. But I would say on average they hang out 2-3 times a week outside of work and they go cycling with a small group. Sometimes they drive to the cycle spot together and a few times they got lunch afterwards, one on one, granted I was invited but my school schedule didn’t allow me to join. They text quite a bit, but I can’t say I’ve seen anything incriminating. 

About a week ago my husband had Saturday off and he was bored texting someone veraciously, I ask who,  and it was his lady work friend. He was texting about making plans to go on a run with her in a few minutes. This bothered me because he didn’t ask me how I felt about it or if I wanted to go. They are both runners, I’m not as fast as them (working on it) but I will oftentimes ride my bike while my husband runs. This bothered me and I told him I wasn’t comfortable with them hanging out one on one. Then a week later they finish a cycle ride and once everyone else leaves she says hey traffic is so bad right now and he says why don’t we go get coffee meanwhile her boyfriend had just left the group to go to Costco. Mind you this is around 5pm and they’d been together since 9am that morning. To me it seems like they just can’t get enough of each other. 

When I confronted my husband and say how would it make you feel if I were doing this, he says you cannot use hypotheticals because every situation is different and that he isn’t attracted to her. Deep down I feel this reasoning is manipulative. When I mentioned what if some similar situation arises like this for me in the future, he insinuated that I might try and precipitate a situation like this to get back at him. To me his reasoning is kind of narcissistic and this reasoning does not instill trust. Especially when he wouldn’t hang out one on one because he said “well now I know how you will react”. I love him but honestly I don’t trust him. He thinks my reaction is rooted in our Christian upbringing he might be right. I’m not sure what’s instinctual and what’s brainwashing.

1oik7x3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oik7x3,Cafeterias em São Paulo,"Fala, pessoal!

Estive em São Paulo por alguns poucos dias, fui em várias cafeterias e pensei em trazer aqui pro sub alguns pensamentos sob a cena do café especial na cidade, bem como opiniões individuais de cada lugar que visitei.

De um modo geral, percebe-se claramente uma diferença entre cafeterias com baristas que gostam, pesquisam, se interessam e sabem fazer café (1) e cafeterias com baristas que sabem fazer café (2).  
Há também uma variável humana inerente à extração de uma xícara de café — a demanda, humor, nível de cansaço influencia diretamente no resultado final da bebida, fazendo com que você nem sempre tenha uma boa experiência naquela cafeteria que é super recomendada e até mesmo premiada.

Muitas dos lugares que visitei possuem coados prontos em garrafas térmicas (BUNN, Moccamaster, NINJA, OXO etc) e opções de grãos para filtrados na hora, que eu optei em todas as cafeterias que fui, com foco em V60.

Um outro ponto interessante que fiquei pensando é a relação V60 - barista, sendo esse um método bem passível a erros, será que não seria mais interessante adotar um método menos ""errável"" — Clever ou Switch — tendo em vista todas as variáveis que podem influenciar uma pessoa a errar uma extração?

O preço médio do filtrado na hora é R$ 20,00 por 200-220mL de bebida.

Meu vocabulário para descrever café não é muito extenso, então não esperem muito.

Desculpem pelas poucas fotos.

Agora segue a lista dos lugares que visitei:

* [Bonita Café](https://www.instagram.com/_bonitacafe/) (República)
   * Laranja, Capim Santo e Aconchego (*Ito*) e havia também o Moca (*Unique*) na térmica.
   * V60 - Laranja (R$ 18,00): extração equilibrada, acidez média, doçura média com sensorial de laranja bem evidente;
   * Foi um bom começo, embora a arquitetura e decoração dos lugares não me são muito convidativos;
   * Barista tipo 2 — quando perguntei onde beber um bom café na cidade, não soube me responder.
* [Brim](https://www.instagram.com/brim_sp/) (República)
   * ""Frutado"" e ""cítrico"" (*Garagem do Café*);
   * Cítrico/V60 (R$ 18,00): nada saltou à boca, corpo médio-leve, extração ok;
   * Frutado/Aeropress (R$ 18,00): corpo clássico do método, extração mais equilibrado, super fácil de beber, frutado bem presente;
   * O ambiente do Brim é muito bom, um espaço enorme com os mais variados assentos e comidas, embora o preço seja bem salgado.
* [Por um Punhado de Dólares](https://www.instagram.com/porumpunhadodedolares/) (Consolação)
   * Gozolândia, Zica Memo e Fuck Coffee - R$ 15,00 (150mL).
   * Zica Memo/V60: café bem mais ou menos, nada com nada. O pão de queijo estava frio e borrachudo. Não recomendo;
   * Conversando com um barista de outro lugar, ele me disse que o PPD já foi um excelente café, mas hoje já não entrega mais.
* [Joana Cafés](https://www.joanacafes.com.br/) (Pinheiros)
   * Paula e Danielle (torra própria);
   * Paula/Origami (R$ 18,00): estava com um corpo leve (semelhante a um chá) quando quente e depois se parecia mais ganhava mais corpo abrindo mais o sensorial e aparecendo notas mais doces.
   * Danielle/Origami (R$ 18,00): o sensorial não me agradou tanto, tinha uma nota ácida mais forte típica de alguns cafés fermentados que eu entendo como frutas vermelhas estragadas, embora a extração (corpo e desenvolvimento quente-frio) estivesse legal.
   * Elas tem cafés gringos eventualmente, mas acaba rápido.
* [Soul Café](https://soulcafe.com.br/)
   * Save Me, Get Up, Sweet Memories (torra própria).
   * Save Me/V60 (R$ 16,00): extração bem ruim, amarga. Não recomendo;
   * Baristas tipo 2;
   * Conversando com um barista de outro café, ele me disse que o Davi (mestre de torra da Soul) é um cara bem legal e que lá tem bons cafés, fiquei afim de voltar outra vez pra trocar uma ideia com o cara e tentar beber um bom café.
* [Fora da Lei](https://www.instagram.com/foradalei_cafe/) (Vila Mariana)
   * Variedade enorme de grãos torrados na casa e também duas opções Daterra (*SocialBeans*)
   * Mira/V60: a extração não estava muito legal, tava puxando um amargor, quando esfriou até ficou bom, mas me confundi com o cardápio deles e acabei pedindo 90mL de café.
   * A precificação é muito confusa, tem o preço dos grãos deles, tem três tamanhos diferentes, tem o método e cada tópico adiciona +X reais, não entendi nem um pouco, mas como já estava bastante cafeinado, acabei pegando o tamanho pequeno (90mL) e paguei 15,00. Selecionei o Mira por indicação do barista de acordo com o que falei que gosto.
   * A barista que preparou estava fazendo 4 cafés ao mesmo tempo e ainda tinha um rapaz de um aplicativo de entregas enchendo o saco, ao final ela não sabia muito bem qual era qual e isso influenciou na extração.
   * Fiquei com vontade de voltar outra vez num horário mais vazio, porque a galera parece curtir muito café e tem umas coisas interessantes ali! Se for, talvez vá num meio da manhã/tarde.
* [Crio](https://www.crio.cafe/) (Vila Mariana)
   * Se vai no Fora da Lei, desce a rua e passa no Crio!
   * Mais de 15 opções de cafés e mais um monte de métodos que eles escolhem a partir do grão que você pede. Há também duas opções de filtrados do dia nas térmicas;
   * Torta de Limão/Origami (R$ 20,00): acidez alta, corpo licoroso, doçura se apresenta conforme o café esfria. Bem gostoso!
   * Lugar muito agradável sem balcão, os cafés são preparados em uma ilha.
* [Clemente Café](https://www.instagram.com/clementecafe.sp/) (Vila Mariana)
   * Graviola (*Ito*), Cachacinha (*Catarina*), um outro que não me lembro, um da Astral que não lembro o nome, um gringo torrado por uma galera de Barcelona (não lembro o grão nem anotei);
   * Pedi o Graviola/V60 (R$ 16,00) — fiquei afim de experimentar quando comentaram aqui no sub sobre o pós colheita *sprouting* — as notas de graviola tanto no nariz quanto na boca são bem presentes (acho que ser familiarizado com o sensorial ajuda bastante a perceber), porém a extração não saiu muito legal, o café estava puxando um amargor desagradável e sem nenhum dulçor, quando o pacote mostra dulçor no seu “nível máximo”.
* [Sarta](https://www.instagram.com/sartacoffee/) (Vila Madalena)
   * Disparado o lugar mais interessante pra se tomar café! Eles fazem apenas DaTerra (*Abgail Coffee Company*) e tem as três linhas de cafés da fazenda.
   * Laurina Daterra Masterpieces (R$ 29,00) no V60 switch — fenomenal, com sensorial de laranja, puxei algo como pêssego/damasco também, corpo leve, acidez alta, doçura média baixa, cafézão!
   * Na sequência, pedi o Blossom (R$ 22,00), embora sensorial de amêndoas não ser o meu favorita, o barista me disse que poderia extrair menos aquele sensorial, mas alguma coisa deu errado na extração que veio um amargor bem chato, falei com Felipe — barista incrível que foi super atencioso e ficamos trocando muita ideia — e prontamente ele se dispôs e fez outro café, dessa vez o Danielle torrado pelas meninas do Joana, que ficou excepcional, diferente do que tomei lá no próprio Joana, no nariz chegava um herbal muito doce, que dava vontade de ficar cheirando aquele café sem parar, na boca um floral bem pronunciado quando quente, passando a um frutado bem interessante conforme o café esfriava, corpo leve/médio que curto demais. Ficou excelente esse café! Quase voltei no Joana pra comprar o pacote, mas não deu tempo. 
   * Felipe me deu também um pouco de grãos de um café da Soul, que comentei aqui anteriormente não ter tido uma experiência muito boa, sem falar que quase todo café que fazia me dava um gole pra provar. 
   * Eles abriram agora, mas vai longe, lugar incrível, galera muito gente fina, com foco e amor nos cafés! Vale muito a pena ir.
* [Catarina Café e Amor](https://www.catarinacafeeamor.com.br/) (Vila Mariana).
   * Muita variedade de grãos torrados por eles e uns cinco grãos torrados pela Dak (Amsterdam).
   * Fui de Cachacinha (R$ 16,00), Flávia e Augusto (R$ 16,00) e um etiópia lavado da Dak (R$ 39,00), todos V60, creio eu.
   * Uma hora me lembrei de pedir um servidor para servir o café eítope no copo aos poucos, mas o rapaz me falou que não poderia fazer isso, uma vez que ele usava o vidro para fazer os cafés — não entendi muito bem porque ele com certeza tem inúmeros vidros para fazer café e não é como se eu estivesse pagando por um café qualquer torrado por eles — se você se coloca pra servir cafés gringos, com preços chegando a mais de 60 reais, você deve saber que comumente não se serve o café direto na xícara, é no mínimo, ridículo. Isso à parte, quando o tal café chegou, veio numa cerâmica com provavelmente menos que 150mL — dei foi risada.
   * Vamos ao que importa:
      * Etíope: no olfato um floral bem interessante passando pra um pêssego ao esfriar. Na boca um corpo leve típico de lavados, floral e frutas, depois o pêssego tomava conta. Cafézão! Um dos melhores lavados que já tomei (não que eu tenha uma experiência extensa com esse pós colheita).
      * O cachacinha tinha um gosto que não curto muito de frutas vermelhas fermentadas até demais e uma nota alcoólica esquisita. Não curti. A extração também passou um pouco e saiu amarga.
      * Flávia e Augusto tava bem legal, notas de açúcar (caldo de cana no pacote) e acidez cítrica bacana. Bom café.
   * O atendimento e cuidado com cliente deixou a desejar, sem falar na quantidade de café, como meu amigo disse à hora “Amor eu até vi, mas faltou café”.
   * O espaço é uma garagem com uma infinidade de coisas para se comprar, eles tem o torrador lá exposto e uma infinidade de sacos de grãos verdes.
   * Me pareceu um daqueles lugares que os locais e fregueses tem um tratamento à parte, não julgo, mas me afastou.

the way one learns to live with rain,
not fighting it,
just walking slower,
letting it soak through until it feels like part of me.

Some mornings,
it’s quiet.
It sits beside my coffee like an old friend,
no longer asking to be understood.
Other days,
it presses against my ribs,
reminding me that healing was never meant to be painless.

I still miss you,
not loudly,
not in words that could fill a room,
but in the way my hands reach for warmth
even when I know it’s gone.
I miss you in the sound of late night trains,
in half written sentences,
in songs that never end where they should.

I used to run from the ache,
to patch it with distraction and pride,
but now I let it stay.
It hums when the world is too still,
and somehow,
its music has begun to sound like peace.

Maybe this is what love becomes
when it’s no longer shared,
a quiet endurance,
a constant remembering,
a soft ache that teaches you
how to hold the world gently,
even when it hurts to touch.

And though the nights are heavy,
and your name still lingers like dust in every corner of me,
I’ve learned to breathe around it,
to exist with the emptiness
without trying to fill it.

Because missing you
isn’t the wound anymore,
it’s the rhythm.
It’s the proof that something beautiful once lived here,
and somehow,
still does.

Firstly I arrived at this university knowing just 1 person. A close friend of mine that happened to know her because they live close by. 1 month passed I would look at her, she would look at me but we never really interacted. One day we had a physics lab we sat next to each other and I decided to talk to her. We did our in-class work and had a assignment for next week. Unexpectedly she waited for me and wanted to meet me. We took a walk around campus for around an hour. Exchanged socials, i didn't think much since I wasn't really feeling anything about her. First week goes by we talk a little from dms she approached me and we started having small talks here and there or as we waited for public transport we would talk for a bit. Now second week comes by we had a common break from 10 till 12 I got a message she wanted to hang out. Again it was mostly about university and all that but slowly slowly we started learning eachother more and more. 


Another week goes by we continued to talk from Instagram but her response times would range from 2 minutes up until 30 hours. I mirrored her behavior to he fair since I didn't care at the time and then she started double texting to get my attention. Tuesday comes by and we have that common break (its the only time of the week we both have a common break). She Again reached out and wanted to hang out at a nearby coffee shop. This time it was different she Firstly showed me her presentation, then vented about different topics about her putting for class representative. She sat next to me leaned onto me and started talking about her problems and bullying she has been facing in class after a good 2 hours of talking and sharing opinions and seeing how much chemistry we had. I started actually taking a liking on this girl.


During that week I helped her socialize and speak to people in our lectures she never spoke to before. I also spread her opinions around class and managed to gather around 35 people to vote for her. Anyways she did end up losing but texted me the same day ""just know im greatful for everything you did ❤️❤️"".
After that her response times where immediate and would find every chance to be close to me.


Currently its exam week. She is stressed, im stressed everyone is. Her response times are 30-40 hours but sends me tik toks all day. Basically she finds chances to talk to me. Always smiles at me, stares at me when im not looking and her body language is open and different around me and gets closer to me than your average friend. She sends me big voice mails 10-15 minutes. Appreciates me because I understand her and vented how she was never really treated this way, having someone that isn't bored of her talking all day. She does have bad rumors going around in my class and that kind of hurts her.


Now what's the negatives you might ask. 2 days ago she started talking about a blue eyed boy that looks at her and she thinks she mightve took an interest. Then hit me with the ""Im here trying to do love but at the same time I don't want to do love."". Now I did try to hit her with the ""yeah I like a girl too"" card but she seemed a little unhinged about it. Didn't ask me any questions like who. She responded with ""I won't judge just tell me and ill see if I'll help.""


I believe she seems me as a bestie/ friend but does invest alot of energy and wants to hang out 1 on 1. At the same time she compliments me and has this behavior.

1oik3qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1oik3qg/im_planning_on_asking_a_guy_out_for_the_first/,I'm planning on asking a guy out for the first time. My only issue is... I don't know how dates work.,"For some background: I'm 25f and I've been crushing hard on a guy at my gym for months, and I have an inkling of hope that he *may* reciprocate my feelings. My gym schedule is gonna change in two weeks, so I wanna hurry up and make a move before that happens.

I'm really nervous about asking him out. I've never done this before. I'm fully prepared for potential rejection. I feel like my schedule change is convenient for this, that way he won't feel so awkward if he does reject me. If anything, I'm even more scared of the possibility of him saying ""yes"" because this will be entirely new territory for me.

I want to ask if he'd be down for getting some coffee with me to see if we click, and maybe we could wander downtown afterward if it goes well. Or I could ask if he'd want to go to the arcade and challenge me to Mario Kart (the arcade has a quiet cozy retro lounge with a SNES).

Also, if he does say yes, would it be weird to tell him that dating is new to me? I feel like that would make him more understanding if I mess up/act awkward etc etc etc

If any of you have advice, I'd really appreciate it.

1oik3ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1oik3ei/a_bad_job_a_tired_lifeschlechte_arbeit_müdes_leben/,"A Bad Job, A Tired Life|Schlechte Arbeit, müdes Leben","Since September this year, I’ve been doing an FSJ volunteer year in a nursing home in Germany. My main work is in the kitchen. At first, because I was new, the supervisors didn’t give me too much responsibility. But since mid-October, another FSJ volunteer and I have been taking care of everything. She works in the upstairs kitchen; I’m in the downstairs one.

Every day I prepare breakfast, make coffee, serve food, wash dishes, get lunch ready, serve again, wash again, make afternoon tea, clean the machines, keep the kitchen tidy. Work starts at 6:30 a.m. There’s a 15-minute break at 10, a 30-minute break at 2 p.m., and the rest of the time I just keep working.

Last week, the supervisors had a “talk” with us. Two women sat us down and said two things:

1. They think we’re not working hard enough and should find extra tasks on our own.
2. I should smile more while working.

To be honest, the job is boring and exhausting. After that talk, it somehow got worse. If it were just about the work, I could accept it. But I’m also preparing for the Goethe B2 German exam. After work, my legs hurt so badly, yet I still study for about one and a half to two hours every night. After more than a month of this routine, I’m both mentally and physically drained.

Is this a bad job? Maybe. But why do I keep doing it? Because they provide free housing, meals, and some pocket money. The truth is, I came to Germany with nothing. Back home I was just a university graduate working in an office. I chose this rough path myself, so I bite my teeth and go on.

I still have many things I want to achieve. I love reading and writing. One day, I’ll become an unhones person — someone who works in an office but secretly writes novels, not letting reality take away the only thing I have left: my thoughts.  
But right now, I’m just a broke dishwasher with dreams too big for my life.

  
Seit September dieses Jahres arbeite ich als FSJ-Freiwilliger in einem Altenheim. Hauptsächlich bin ich in der Küche tätig. Am Anfang, weil ich mit der Arbeit noch nicht vertraut war, hat die Leitung mir nicht gleich alles überlassen. Seit Mitte dieses Monats erledige ich zusammen mit einer anderen FSJlerin alle Küchenarbeiten: Sie ist in der oberen Küche, ich in der unteren. Jeden Tag bereite ich das Frühstück vor, koche Kaffee, verteile das Essen, spüle das Geschirr, bereite das Mittagessen zu, teile es aus, spüle wieder, mache den Nachmittagstee, räume die Spülmaschine aus und halte die Küche sauber. Der Arbeitstag beginnt um halb sieben, um zehn Uhr gibt es eine Viertelstunde Pause, um zwei Uhr eine halbe Stunde – sonst arbeite ich durchgehend.

Letzte Woche führten zwei Leiterinnen des Hauses ein Gespräch mit uns. Sie sagten im Wesentlichen zwei Dinge:

1. Sie finden, unsere Arbeit sei nicht ausgelastet, ich solle selbständig nach Aufgaben suchen.
2. Ich solle bei der Arbeit öfter lächeln.

Ehrlich gesagt, die Arbeit ist langweilig und anstrengend. Nach diesem Gespräch wurde eine ohnehin schlechte Arbeit noch schlechter. Wenn es nur um die Arbeit ginge, würde ich mich damit abfinden. Aber ich bereite mich gleichzeitig auf die Goethe-B2-Prüfung vor. Nach der Schicht tun mir die Beine weh, und dann lerne ich trotzdem noch jeden Abend anderthalb bis zwei Stunden Deutsch. Nach mehr als einem Monat dieser Vorbereitung bin ich nun körperlich und geistig erschöpft.

Ist das eine schlechte Arbeit? Vielleicht. Warum mache ich trotzdem weiter? Weil sie mir freie Unterkunft und Verpflegung bieten und mir jeden Monat ein Taschengeld zahlen. Im Grunde habe ich in Deutschland nichts – und auch in meinem Heimatland war ich nur ein Büroangestellter mit einem Uniabschluss. Ich habe einen schwierigen Weg gewählt. Ich habe ihn mir selbst ausgesucht, also beiße ich die Zähne zusammen und mache weiter.

Ich habe noch viele Dinge, die ich verwirklichen will. Ich liebe das Lesen, das Schreiben. Eines Tages werde ich ein unehrlicher Mensch sein – jemand, der im Büro arbeitet, aber heimlich an Romanen bastelt, um sich vom Alltag nicht das Denken nehmen zu lassen. Doch im Moment bin ich nur ein mittelloser Tellerwäscher mit großen Träumen.

原文：糟糕的工作，困顿的人生

从今年9月份开始，我在一家养老院做FSJ志愿者。主要在厨房工作，刚开始由于不熟悉工作内容，所以机构的领导没有把活全都丢给我，这个月中旬开始，我和另外一位FSJ志愿者开始包揽厨房的所有工作，她在楼上的厨房，我在楼下的厨房。每天我要准备早餐，煮咖啡，分发早餐，洗盘子，准备午饭，分发午饭，洗盘子，准备下午茶，洗洗碗机，保持厨房干净。每天的工作从六点半开始，10点有15分钟休息时间，下午2点有半小时休息时间，除此之外，一直干活。上周机构的领导和我们进行谈话，两位女士主要说了两点：1.他们觉得我们的工作不够饱和，我应该有自觉，自己找活干。2.我在工作中应该多笑笑。

老实说，这份工作很无聊，压力很大，这次谈话后，让本就糟糕的工作更加糟糕。如果只是工作，那我就认栽了，但是我最近在备考德语B2，下班后我的腿已经痛得不行，于是我就开始学德语，每天晚上1.5小时到2小时。一个多月的备考后，也就是此刻，身心俱疲。

这是一份糟糕的工作吗？也许是。但我为什么要继续下去？因为他们提供免费住宿，承包伙食，每月还提供零花钱。说到底，我来到德国一无所有，在母国我也只是个坐在办公室上班的大学毕业生，我选了一条崎岖的路，认栽了，我咬咬牙继续。

我还有很多未实现的事情，我爱看书，爱写作，总有一天，我要成为一个不诚实的人，在办公室工作中混水摸鱼，构思我的小说，不让现实剥夺我仅有的思想。但现在，我只是一个身无一物，空有梦想的洗碗工。",1,1761682418.0,expats,1,1.0,False

I’m posting again here to expand my horizons by this time around simply hoping to make new friends too. Would be great to get touch with whom I was speaking to previously - perhaps I impulsively deleted my account too soon before anything materialized further. 

About me: I’m a male in my late-20s, straight/heteromantic, and someone who really could  have learned that being-asexual is a thing sooner, in terms of coming to terms with it and just being more comfortable with oneself. 

I live in India, working on graduating right now & also as a writer/analyst. I enjoy traveling, reading, watching slow-burn-drama cinema & shows, comedy, photography, music (please share your playlist with me), consuming way too much coffee, learning new things, listening to history & science podcasts, & the rest I can yap about when we speak!
