Solo [wildlife travel in India](https://www.culturalsafaritours.com/) feels a bit like stepping into your own movie. You land in a new place with just your backpack, your camera, and your curiosity, and the rest of the story slowly unfolds in front of you. A tiger crossing the track in silence, an elephant herd walking through golden light, a forest guide whispering stories by the campfire at night. It is just you and the wild. No distractions, no compromises, no fixed script.

For many people, solo travel already feels like a big step. Solo wildlife adventure in India can sound even bigger, maybe even a little scary. Forests, unknown places, new languages, wild animals, safety doubts, and the fear of feeling alone. But with the right planning, mindset, and guidance, solo wildlife trips in India can become the most powerful, healing, and unforgettable journeys of your life.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to plan a safe, meaningful, and exciting solo wildlife adventure in India. From choosing the right national parks and staying safe, to meeting like minded travelers and finding moments of silence that change you from within, you will find it all here in a simple, friendly way.

# Why Choose a Solo Wildlife Adventure in India

Traveling solo for wildlife is very different from a regular holiday. You are not just checking places off a list. You are entering living landscapes, watching real life unfold in front of your eyes. India is one of the best countries in the world for this kind of journey.

India offers incredible wildlife diversity. You can look for tigers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, rhinos in Assam, lions in Gujarat, elephants in Kerala, leopards in Jawai and Jhalana, and rare birds almost everywhere. The forests are old, the ecosystems are alive, and each national park has its own personality.

A solo wildlife trip gives you:

* Freedom to choose your pace, dates, and budget
* Time to sit quietly and really absorb what you see
* Space for reflection, journaling, and photography without rushing
* More chances to connect deeply with local guides, naturalists, and fellow travelers

When you are alone, you notice more. The sound of dry leaves under the jeep, the nervous calls of langurs when a predator is near, the way light falls on river water at sunrise. These details stay with you long after the trip ends.

# Is Solo Wildlife Travel in India Safe?

This is usually the first question that comes to mind, and it is a fair one. The short answer is yes, solo wildlife travel in India can be safe if you plan well, choose trusted operators, and use basic common sense.

Inside national parks, safaris are strictly regulated. You are never allowed to walk inside core zones on your own. You always go with a registered guide and driver, in a jeep, canter, or boat. Camps and lodges near forests have safety measures, trained staff, and clear rules for guests.

As a solo traveler, especially if you are a woman, it helps to:

* Book stays with good reviews and clear ratings
* Use registered safari operators instead of last minute touts
* Share your basic itinerary with a family member or friend
* Avoid walking alone in dark, isolated areas around villages at night
* Trust your instincts and say no when something feels off

Most wildlife areas in India are used to receiving international and solo travelers. People are usually helpful, curious, and hospitable. With a bit of awareness and respect for local culture, you are likely to feel safe and welcome.

# Choosing the Right Wildlife Destination for Your First Solo Trip

India has many national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, so it can feel overwhelming to pick just one. The key is to choose based on your comfort level, what you want to see, and how experienced you are as a solo traveler.

# Great Options for First Time Solo Wildlife Travelers

These parks are popular, well connected, and have plenty of stay options:

* Ranthambore National Park, Rajasthan Ideal if you are starting from Jaipur or Delhi. It is famous for tigers, beautiful landscapes, and easy accessibility.
* Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand Perfect if you like greenery, rivers, and a calm atmosphere. You may see elephants, deer, birds, and if you are lucky, a tiger.
* Kanha and Bandhavgarh National Parks, Madhya Pradesh Both are excellent for tiger sightings. Kanha has dreamy sal forests and meadows, Bandhavgarh is intense and thrilling.
* Pench National Park, MP/Maharashtra Peaceful, scenic, and less crowded. Great for those who enjoy slow travel and nature.
* Kaziranga National Park, Assam Best for one horned rhinos, elephants, and lovely grassland landscapes.
* Gir National Park, Gujarat The only place to see Asiatic lions in the wild.

If you are a beginner, avoid very remote areas for your first solo wildlife trip. Start with a well known park, get a feel for the rhythm, and then you can explore more offbeat places like Tadoba, Jawai, or the Sundarbans later.

# How to Plan Your Solo Wildlife Itinerary

Planning a solo wildlife adventure in India is all about balancing travel time, safari time, and rest. Instead of rushing through many parks, focus on one or two and spend a few days in each.

A simple structure could be:

* Day 1: Travel to the nearest town, reach your lodge, rest, and enjoy the surroundings
* Day 2: Morning and afternoon safari, relax in between, talk to guides, stargaze at night
* Day 3: Another safari, village walk, birdwatching, or nature trail depending on the park
* Day 4: Last safari and departure

If you are doing multiple parks, you can link them smartly. For example, you can combine Kanha and Bandhavgarh, or Ranthambore with Bharatpur (Keoladeo Bird Sanctuary).

Think about:

* How many days you truly have
* How far the park is from the nearest airport or railway station
* The best season for the park you want to visit
* How many safaris you want to experience (at least three to four is ideal)

You do not need a very complicated schedule. What you need is enough time in the forest to increase your chances of sightings and to really sink into the feel of the place.

# Booking Safaris and Stays Without Stress

As a solo traveler, you want things to be smooth so that you can focus on the experience, not the logistics.

# Where to Book Safaris

Most popular national parks in India allow online safari bookings through forest department websites or trusted travel partners. There are usually two main vehicle types:

* Jeep Safari Smaller, more flexible, more personal. Good for photography and intimate experiences.
* Canter Safari Bigger open bus like vehicles. Slightly less flexible but more economical, and a good way to share the experience with others.

Book safaris at least a few weeks in advance for popular parks and peak seasons, especially if you want specific zones in tiger parks.

# Choosing the Right Stay

As a solo wildlife traveler, the place you stay can shape your entire experience. Look for:

* Lodges close to the park gate to reduce travel time before safaris
* Properties known for experienced naturalists and guided nature walks
* Reviews that mention safety, cleanliness, and good hospitality
* Stays that offer shared safari bookings so you do not have to book a full jeep alone if that feels expensive

Some eco lodges also host evening talks about animal behavior, conservation, or photography, which can be great for solo travelers who enjoy learning and meeting others.

# What to Pack for a Solo Wildlife Adventure in India

Packing right makes your solo journey easier, more comfortable, and more enjoyable. The goal is to travel light, but smart.

Here are essentials to consider:

* Light, breathable clothes in earthy shades like olive, brown, beige, or khaki
* A warm layer if you are traveling in winter, because morning safaris can be cold
* A good pair of closed shoes or trekking shoes
* Hat or cap, sunglasses, and sunscreen to protect from the sun
* A reusable water bottle and light snacks like nuts or energy bars
* Binoculars for birdwatching and spotting wildlife at a distance
* A camera with zoom if you enjoy photography, plus extra batteries and memory cards
* A small backpack or sling bag for carrying things during safaris
* Basic medicines, including something for motion sickness if you need it
* A power bank for your phone, especially if you are staying in remote places

You do not need fancy gear to enjoy wildlife. Even with simple clothes and a curious mind, you can have a life changing experience.

# How a Solo Safari Day Usually Feels

Every park is different, but most days follow a similar rhythm that feels surprisingly peaceful.

You wake up before sunrise, often around 5 am. The air is cool, sometimes misty, sometimes crisp. It is quiet in a way cities never are. You have some tea or coffee, maybe a light snack, then head to the gate. Several jeeps line up, guides chat softly, and birds slowly begin their morning songs.

Once inside the park, the forest opens up. Tall trees, open meadows, rocky hills, rivers, or lakes, depending on where you are. You watch the sun slowly rise, turning everything golden.

Your guide looks for signs: fresh pugmarks of tigers, hoof marks of deer, broken branches, alarm calls of langurs or barking deer. Sometimes, everything is calm and you just enjoy the forest waking up. Sometimes, a sudden series of calls sends a rush of excitement through the jeep. You might wait at a bend in the road for twenty, thirty, forty minutes.

Then, if you are lucky, the jungle reveals itself. A tiger walks out, confident and quiet. Or a leopard crosses a distant slope. Or an elephant herd appears near a river. Even if you do not see a big cat, you might spend time with a family of langurs, a pair of jackals, or a group of wild boar.

After a few hours, you return to the lodge for breakfast and rest. The day continues with reading, walking around the property, chatting with staff, or simply lying on a hammock listening to birds. In the afternoon, you go for another safari. At night, you may sit by a bonfire, share stories with other travelers, and watch the stars.

Solo, this rhythm becomes even more powerful, because you are not distracted. You are fully present.

# Meeting People as a Solo Wildlife Traveler

Traveling alone does not mean being lonely. In fact, national parks are some of the easiest places to meet like minded people.

You share jeeps or canters with other travelers. You sit together for meals at the lodge. You listen to the same guide telling you about how tigers mark their territory or how birds migrate thousands of kilometers. These shared moments naturally lead to conversation.

You may meet:

* Other solo travelers, both Indian and international
* Wildlife photographers who have visited many parks
* Families who love nature and are curious to learn
* Local guides with decades of stories about individual tigers, leopards, and elephants

You do not have to be very social if you do not want to. But if you feel like talking, asking questions, or sharing experiences, you will find many chances. Some solo travelers end up planning their next safari together with new friends they meet on the previous one.

# Solo Safety Tips Inside and Outside the Jungle

Inside the jungle, your main responsibility is to follow the rules. These are not just for your safety, but for the safety of animals and the health of the ecosystem.

Important rules include:

* Never get down from the safari vehicle inside the park unless the guide clearly allows it at designated points
* Do not shout, play loud music, or make sudden movements to disturb animals
* Never throw food or try to feed wildlife
* Do not ask guides to get too close to animals or violate distance norms for a better photo
* Respect the forest timings and gate rules

Outside the park, in nearby towns or villages, basic solo travel safety applies:

* Avoid walking alone in very dark, isolated areas late at night
* Keep your valuables secure and do not leave them unattended
* Use registered cabs or transport services whenever possible
* Be polite but firm if you are not interested in certain offers or services

When in doubt, you can always ask your lodge to arrange safe and trusted transport, guides, or activities.

# Budgeting for a Solo Wildlife Trip in India

Wildlife travel can be done in both a budget friendly and a luxury way, depending on your choices. As a solo traveler, you may need to plan a bit more carefully because you are not splitting costs.

Your main expenses will be:

* Transport (flights, trains, or cars to reach the park)
* Accommodation (ranges from simple homestays to luxury lodges)
* Safari permits and vehicle costs
* Food and tips

To keep costs balanced, you can:

* Travel in shoulder seasons like November or February, when prices are not at the highest
* Choose mid range lodges that offer clean rooms and good food without being too fancy
* Share jeeps or canters with other travelers instead of booking a private vehicle every time
* Combine train travel with short taxi rides instead of long private car transfers

It is possible to have a fulfilling solo wildlife adventure in India without spending a fortune, especially if you are flexible with dates and ready to stay in simple but comfortable places.

# Emotional Benefits of Solo Wildlife Travel

Beyond the animals, beyond the photos, something deeper happens on a solo wildlife journey.

Nature has a way of softening the edges of stress. The more time you spend watching trees, rivers, and animals, the more you feel your own breathing slow down. You start to notice small things again: sunlight on leaves, patterns on butterfly wings, the smell of wet earth.

Many solo travelers say:

* They gained confidence after navigating trains, jeeps, and new places by themselves
* They discovered they enjoy their own company more than they thought
* They felt inspired, peaceful, or even healed after days in the forest
* They left with more respect and love for animals and the environment

A solo wildlife adventure in India is not just travel. It often becomes a turning point, a quiet inner reset.

# Simple Mistakes to Avoid

To keep your trip smooth, try to avoid common mistakes like:

* Booking everything at the last minute in peak season, which can lead to high prices or no safari availability
* Trying to cover too many parks in too few days, which makes the trip tiring and rushed
* Ignoring local advice about weather, road conditions, or safety
* Having very rigid expectations, like “I must see a tiger or this trip is a failure”

Wildlife is not a zoo. You might see tigers on your first safari, or not even after several. What you will definitely see is a living forest full of stories and interactions. The more open you are, the more you receive.

# How to Choose Responsible Operators and Lodges

Because you love wildlife, it is important to support people and places that care about conservation. When choosing where to book, look for:

* Lodges that avoid loud parties, plastic waste, and unnecessary disturbance
* Guides who respect animals, maintain distance, and follow park rules
* Operators who hire local staff and share benefits with nearby communities
* Properties that save water, reduce power use, and avoid cutting trees unnecessarily

By choosing responsible tourism, you become part of the solution. Your solo trip then supports forests and local families, not just your own adventure.",1,1767881705.0,Indiatravellertips,0,1.0,False

I am currently 28 years old and live without any type of finished apprenticeship or education beyond basic school.

My father has been pretty abusive to our family back when we were growing up. He would beat my half brother from time to time, constantly punish us for ANYTHING and even lash out at my mom. He never physically hurt her I don't think, but he still threatened her, or throw a mug of hot coffee toward the ceiling, leaving it for her to clean it up.  
He is the type of father who wants to help you study, but then get super upset when you cant get it right and then end up threatening you with punishments.  
  
I've been told by my mom that he once threatened her with a metal baseball bat to leave the house because she left his drunk self behind when she drove home. Apparently he acted like an asshole at wherever they were at, and didn't want to have to deal with him that night.  
I've heard they cheated on each other too. Of course both cast blame but as witness throughout my life, my dad was always the one being the intimidating force yelling and punishing everyone, beating my brother or generally being angry. He was a big guy, who worked out and used to be part of a biker gang. He looks exactly like you imagine him right now.  
The worst time I believe is when he beat my brother so badly that they fell backwards on the couch, as he continued beating him. My brother ran away right after and didn't return for a few days as he stayed with his biological dad. Somehow my mom convinced him not to sue my father. The reason by the way was that my bro took my internet stick, and used it on his PC to gain access to the internet, despite being banned from doing so for a few weeks.

Now this was years ago and he DID seek anger management, he even now works a pretty high position, earning up to 10k or so a month. He owns a house in SWITZERLAND, has a koi pond and visits turkey for holidays every few months. My parents broke up 10 years or so ago too. And I get that he used to work a job he didn't like, he was thus grumpy a lot of the time. He worked hard. There WERE times where he was nice, or did something good for us. It just doesn't erase the bad. I'm still scared of him to this day, despite knowing that he's not the same anymore. He STILL gets mad when you disagree with him, and he does tend to make fun of me or talk to me in a patronizing manner. And I get it, Im kind of a loser. Im 28 and didn't achieve anything. Its fair for him to think of me as a failure. His current wife DID help me find a job about a year ago too.

But that's exactly part of why I'm thinking on not talking to him anymore. I feel like he never takes me seriously, he never helped me despite making a good amount of money. I was receiving welfare for 8 years or so, ranking up a dept of around 90k CHF now. I was going through depression, attempted suicide and was 150kg heavy. He specifically had instances on Christmas or dinner where he just said something like ""Btw, never ask me for money."" or ""When I die, you wont get a thing from me""  
  
Even recently got super angry and screamed his shit inside the courtroom when he lost the court case against my mom, where he's set to continuing to pay her 1k a month.   
I tried to talk to him about my issues with him before, but he doesn't admit fault and says ""MY dad did so much worse to me, you guys cant complain, you had it nice""  
We had a small fight once and didn't chat for a few years, once I talked to him again since I didn't wanna lose my only dad he told me what he would have never talked to me again if I haven't sent a message first.  
I'm the only child of his that still talks to him, I partly feel bad, but Im sick of always feeling a bit nervous/afraid of him whenever I visit or having him talk shit about mom, or talk about how badly Im doing. That Im not doing enough.

Im attempting to get an apprenticeship this year, and Im thankful for his wife's help to find a job...but Im simply mentally exhausted to deal with him. And him pretending that he didn't do any of that.   
I am aware that I could've sued him for having to help me financially throughout the years, but couldn't do it as I was scared of his reaction.  
  
Am I being a pussy about it? Should I just toughen it out or something? I think of just not communicating with him, and move away to somewhere new once I found that new apprenticeship or career without telling him.",1,1767881541.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I'm experiencing very bad GERD/LPR since Sep 2025, when I get sudden bout of gagging in the middle of the night. Was put on PPIs and maybe it got better. 

But in recent weeks crossing into 2026, I have a severe tightening of my inner throat muscles as if someone is strangling me. Each time I swallow my saliva, it feels like there's a physical object in the base of my throat.

But now, I have this pronounced sensation in the base of my throat and it 'shifts' -- sometimes in the middle, sometimes towards the left. This feeling is relieved each time I burp. I have been burping way much more excessively, and I realise my tummy is super bloated. But sometimes, when I feel like air is stuck in the oesophagus, that's when I really feel the strangling comes in full force, and I feel like I'm dying as I am unable to breathe.

But what I noticed is that I have a very bad sprain behind the back of my neck on the right side each time I turned towards the left and much more painful when I turn towards the right. I'm not too sure if it's related.

(Some causes that could have led up to my first episode in September -- I got a new ergonomic chair and sometimes I feel the way I sit for prolonged hours at my home desk, it might exert pressure on my stomach. I also did a mini massage gun near the side of my neck. I do take coffee almost daily, and chocolate at times.)

(Other background: I have globus since young, always a state of anxiety whenever I have to sit for a test etc. and the lump sensation is always in the middle part of the throat, and doesn't feel as pronounced. I also do have a hypersensitive tongue since young. I was diagnosed with mild hiatal hernia in my early 30s but before I was drinking 3-4 cups of coffee each day while working in a stressful corporate environment.)  
  
I'll be seeing the ENT specialist for the first time on the 28 January, and if to no avail, I will be routed to see the gastroenterologist.

I am really scared but I don't know if I should also bring up this issue of this neck sprain -- I asked my General Practitioner and he didn't think much of it. Would greatly appreciate all help :( Thank you in advance",1,1767881486.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

1q7cn7i,https://i.redd.it/1w401h68u4cg1.jpeg,Why won’t my machine grind beans [De’Longhi Dinamica],"Hey everyone — hoping for a last-ditch sanity check from the community before I return this machine.

I just bought a brand new De’Longhi Dinamica (super-automatic) and I cannot get it to grind beans or produce coffee.

What’s happening:
	•	When I try to brew, I hear the grinder start normally for a few seconds
	•	Beans barely budge in the hopper (maybe a tiny movement)
	•	Then the machine stops, throws the red warning triangle, and the bean icons flash
	•	No coffee comes out

What I’ve already tried (multiple times):
	•	Fully primed the machine with hot water via the water spout
	•	Confirmed water tank is full and fully seated
	•	Brew group removed/reinserted
	•	Hopper emptied and cleaned (removed chaff/dust)
	•	Grinder set to very coarse (7–8)
	•	Adjusted grind only while grinder is running
	•	Tried with hopper half full and ¾ full
	•	Tapped/shook the machine gently while grinding
	•	Confirmed it’s NOT in pre-ground mode
	•	Beans are medium roast, dry, non-oily
	•	Confirmed the metal anti-bridging arm in the hopper is stationary (as designed)

Additional observations:
	•	The grinder sounds normal, not strained
	•	It does not sound jammed
	•	Beans appear to be bridging above the burr inlet and not feeding down
	•	This is straight out of the box — never successfully pulled a shot

At this point I’m trying to figure out:
	•	Is there a known factory feed defect with these?
	•	Any obscure “first-run” tricks I’m missing?
	•	Or is this just return time?",0,1767881121.0,espresso,1,0.5,False
1q7cmx5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q7cmx5,Raipur Airport Lounge,"As I was travelling with a toddler, and had to kill few hours in Raipur Airport, I had researched quite a lot about Raipur Airport lounge that was inaugurated last month. 

I found some inaccurate info in previous reddit posts. Let me debunk them and also mention few findings of my own 

1. The lounge is after the security checkin, some posts mentioned it is before going to security area. 

2. Currently they accept Kotak Mahindra Card (started few days ago) as well along with ICICI and Priority Pass. 

3. They are definitely checking for the card holders name in the boarding pass and not allowing for mismatch. 

4. Breakfast was quite average I'd say - there was Poha (without sev or nimbu), idli, upma, and veg cold sandwich. Coconut chutney was good and std taste. Sambar was horrible. 

There is no juice, soda or alcohol available. Tea was readily available but tastes like made from some premix and is very light - didn't like the taste. Coffee is available on demand. 

Bonus tip - if you ask them they'll grill the otherwise mundane sandwich with butter which makes it 5x tastier. 

5. No washroom available inside the lounge. Even for Handwash you have go out use the ground floor washrooms which felt very inconvenient. 

PS - I was visited it today morning 9 am. 
PPS - Not ranting about the lounge, I am glad that atleast something basic has strated and can get improved over time. I'm just stating the current facts that makes decision easier for future travellers. ",12,1767881102.0,Raipur,1,1.0,False
1q7cm81,https://i.redd.it/e97lwchyt4cg1.jpeg,The Cursed Heiress: Now I'm Their Billionaire Nightmare,"Chapter 1 I'm Jacob, Your Brother!
Nadine Clark lingered at the edge of a street, her gaze fixed on a modest two-story home tucked behind a small courtyard. 

This was it--the place where the Clark family lived. 

For more than twenty years, she'd clung to memories and imagined scenes of the home she'd never truly known. 

Now, standing here at last, her heart ached with questions she'd carried for as long as she could remember. 

What could have made her real parents turn their backs on her? 

How could they leave her to be passed off to strangers, only to end up in the nightmare that was Urygan? 

The last words from her foster parents rang in her ears. ""You're Nadine Clark, the unwanted child, tossed aside by your own bl\*\*d.""

It was that pain--and the hope of one day facing her birth parents--that gave her the strength to endure everything she'd suffered in Urygan's darkness. 

She was about to cross the street when a harsh sound echoed from a grimy alley just a few steps away. 

In the shadows, a man who should have been standing tall was instead crumpled on the ground, taking savage blows from a much smaller, mean-faced figure. 

""You still believe you're some kind of Clark family prince, that you can call the shots? Wake up! You think you'll get your hands on medicine for your crazy mother?""

Without hesitation, the smaller man raised his boot and smashed it down on the outstretched hand of the man on the ground. 

The crack of breaking bone split the air. 

The tall man lay huddled on the dirty pavement, his body shaking with pain as a strangled gr\*\*n slipped past his lips. 

Despite the agony, his grip never loosened around the bundle in his arms. 

Watching from the shadows, Nadine felt a strange ache in her ch\*\*t--then, without hesitation, she appeared behind the man's attacker. 

The sound of bones snapping rang through the alley. A howl burst from the smaller man as he toppled over, clutching his ankle in shock. 

""You have a death wish or something?"" Nadine asked, her gaze cold and unflinching. 

Writhing on the ground, the t\*\*g spat cu\*\*es between sobs. ""You have no idea who you're messing with, you little bi\*\*h. You're done for...""

Before he could finish, Nadine pressed her shoe hard onto his injured ankle. 

His screams echoed down the alley, desperation twisting his face. ""Please! I'm sorry, I swear! I didn't know--I'll never do it again, just let me go!""

Nadine's voice was flat and cold. ""Get lost.""

Without a second's delay, the t\*\*g scrambled to his feet and vanished down the alley. 

A moment later, a person dressed in black stepped out of the shadows and held out a folder. 

""Boss,"" he said respectfully. ""Here's everything on the Clark family, including the truth behind your disappearance all those years ago.""

Nadine flipped open the folder, her eyes widening as she absorbed the words on each page. 

More than two decades ago, the Clark family's little girl vanished after being snatched by traffickers just outside their front door. 

That moment shattered a once-celebrated family, sending them into a downward spiral they never escaped. 

Her mother, Stacey Clark, lost her grip on reality, and madness consumed her. 

Her father, Jordy Clark, fell ill soon after, his health failing until there was no hope left. 

Brad Clark, the oldest brother and a gifted pianist, abandoned his dreams and humbled himself into a wealthy marriage--all for the sake of buying medicine for their parents. 

Kaden Clark, the second brother, was once the star of the police department. He was framed, arrested, and sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit. 

Jacob Clark, the youngest, turned to the city's underbelly, desperate to clear Kaden's name and track down his missing sister. 

His efforts only left him battered and powerless, kicked around by anyone with the slightest authority. 

Even as the family lost almost everything, they still scraped together every cent they could, never giving up the search for Nadine--even pouring millions into what everyone else called a hopeless cause. 

Nadine's hands shook as she reached the end of the file. The anger that had fueled her for years crumbled in an instant. 

She hadn't been abandoned at all. 

There had always been someone longing for her return. 

A rustling sound drew her attention--the taller man, battered and bl\*\*ding, struggled to his feet. 

He froze when he caught sight of Nadine, recognition dawning beneath the bl\*\*d and grime. 

Then, half stumbling, half running, he reached for her. ""Nadine! Is it really you? I'm Jacob, your brother!""

Stunned, Nadine repeated, ""Jacob?""

Jacob nodded frantically, voice thick with emotion. ""It's me! We never stopped searching for you. I can't believe you're finally home!""


Chapter 2 You're Engaged To The Bailey Heir
Worried Nadine might doubt him, Jacob quickly reached beneath his shirt and pulled out a worn pocket watch. 

He popped it open, revealing a faded photograph inside. 

""Nadine, look at this. That's our family--see for yourself!""

The image showed a graceful woman with a gentle smile, cradling a little girl who looked like a porcelain doll. Both were beaming, their happiness captured forever. 

There was no mistaking it--the woman's features mirrored Nadine's own. Their faces had the same soft shape, and when they smiled, identical dimples formed at the corners of their mouths. 

Nadine's breath caught. 

Now she understood how Jacob had recognized her instantly. He really was her brother. 

""You vanished twenty years ago--a trafficker grabbed you right outside our gate. We went crazy looking for you. Mom lost herself from the grief. She clings to your favorite doll and whispers your childhood nickname, Naddie, all day long..."" Jacob's hand reached out, trembling, but he hesitated before touching her sleeve. 

With a desperate hope, he pleaded, ""Please come home. Mom's sick--she's never stopped waiting for you to walk back through the door.""

Nadine nodded, her answer gentle but sure. ""I'll come with you.""

While they walked, Jacob asked how she'd managed to find them after so many years apart. 

Nadine offered a simple reply: she'd registered with a missing persons initiative that bridged Archam and Urygan. By chance, the search reunited her with her family. 

The man in black who had appeared earlier was simply a government escort, tasked with bringing her home. 

Nadine decided to keep her true circumstances to herself. 

Everything she had endured, and the influence she now held, felt impossible to explain to her family in a way they could understand. 

She worried that the truth might only frighten them. 

When Jacob heard that Nadine had been trafficked to Urygan, his entire body trembled with guilt and sorrow. 

Regret gnawed at him--if only he'd kept a closer eye on her years ago, maybe she wouldn't have endured so much pain. 

A fierce promise took root inside him. He would stand by his sister from this day on, never letting harm come her way again. 

He never let go of her hand for a single step as they approached the house. 

The moment the door swung open, a disheveled woman raced out, clinging to a worn, filthy doll. ""Is my baby home? Has Naddie finally come back to me?""

The woman's gaze found Nadine's face, and hope blazed in her eyes. ""Naddie... my sweet Naddie... It's really you!""

She crushed Nadine in a desperate embrace. 

For a moment, Nadine went rigid, overwhelmed by the woman's wild energy. 

Could this truly be the mother who had lost her mind searching for her child? 

Nadine wrapped her arms around Stacey, choking back a rush of emotion. ""I'm here, Mom. I've come back.""

This time, Nadine was determined--she'd never let anyone harm the Clark family again. 

Just then, another door creaked open behind them. 

A girl draped in expensive silk, a luxurious bracelet flashing at her wrist, leaned against the frame, her expression cold and unimpressed.

""So the real daughter finally shows up? Perfect. I've played the stand-in long enough. Now I can leave without a backward glance.""

Daniela Clark, standing in the doorway, gave Nadine a slow, contemptuous once-over. 

""Enough with the touching mother-daughter reunion at the entrance. It's making me sick. Get inside, will you? I don't want you wasting my time--I need to finish packing.""

Jacob's face turned pale. ""Daniela, where exactly do you think you're heading? This family has cared for you for more than ten years. Have we ever treated you badly?""

""So I'm supposed to stick around?"" Daniela sneered, her voice sharp. ""For what--so I can nurse a mother who's lost her mind and a dying father? I'm not letting you ruin my future with your endless problems.""

""That's enough!"" Jacob's hands balled into fists, anger simmering in his eyes. 

Daniela only laughed harder, her voice rising. ""What, did I hit a nerve? Go ahead, enjoy your little reunion. From this moment on, I want nothing to do with this miserable place!""

With a toss of her hair, she disappeared into the house. 

Watching her, Nadine pieced it together in an instant. 

So this was the adopted daughter who'd grown up under the Clark family's roof--eager to walk out the second an opportunity arose, clutching every last valuable she could carry. 

Moments later, Daniela reappeared, wrestling a stuffed suitcase behind her. 

Nadine stepped squarely in her path. ""So that's it? Now that you've drained the Clark family of everything, you're just going to walk away? You leech.""

""Don't talk rubbish! Move!"" Daniela shrieked, voice shrill. 

Without a word, Nadine wrenched the suitcase from her grasp, then swiftly slipped the bracelet from Daniela's wrist and unclasped the necklace at her throat. 

To Nadine, Daniela was nothing more than a thief--someone who'd already taken too much. 

Daniela screamed and lunged. ""What do you think you're doing, you maniac? Give those back!""

Nadine dodged her easily, letting Daniela sprawl awkwardly to the floor. 

A twist of Nadine's wrist cracked open the suitcase, scattering its contents--gold bracelets, necklaces encrusted with diamonds, and several pieces of rare jewelry--across the floor. 

What remained in Daniela's suitcase was likely all the Clark family had left of any value. 

Daniela clearly intended to leave them penniless and desperate. 

""Those belong to me! Give them back!"" Daniela shrieked, her eyes wild as she scrambled to snatch the scattered treasures.

But Nadine stood her ground, knowing full well these items were the only way to afford medicine for Stacey and Jordy. 

She thought of Jacob taking beatings just to get by, and fury flashed in her eyes. 

Without warning, Nadine raised her foot and drove her boot straight into Daniela's stomach. 

""Ah--!"" Daniela's cry split the air as she tumbled into the muddy courtyard, clutching her side in agony. 

Glaring down at her, Nadine's words came out cold as stone. ""Get out. If you show your face around here again, you'll regret it.""

Coughing and trembling, Daniela dragged herself upright, shooting Nadine a look filled with hatred. ""This isn't over! Just wait!""

She pointed a shaky finger at the pile of jewelry and gemstones, sneering, ""Keep it. Think of it as a parting gift for your dying father and your mad mother.""

Then, lips curling into a malicious grin, Daniela added, ""Almost slipped my mind--congratulations, Nadine. You're engaged to the Bailey heir. The one everyone calls a lost cause--a notorious playboy. Enjoy your happy ending!""


Chapter 3 She Had Not Been Forgotten
A fit of coughing echoed from the doorway. 

Jordy, whom Daniela had called a dying father, braced himself on the frame and dragged his feet forward, determined not to collapse. 

""Are you Nadine?"" His voice wavered, but his eyes shone with a fragile hope as he looked her way. 

A strange warmth welled up in Nadine's ch\*\*t, leaving her shaken in a way she could not quite explain. 

Did all those stories about family bonds ring true after all? 

""I am,"" she replied, her voice steady. 

Jordy's composure shattered at her answer, and tears rolled freely down his cheeks. ""You've come home. That's all I ever hoped for. Just having you here is enough for me.""

In the middle of this, Stacey quietly emerged from the chaos, holding an old wooden box in her arms. ""Naddie, come see... everything in here is for you.""

When Nadine peered inside, she found a treasure trove of keepsakes--a faded pink dress fit for a little princess, sweaters that had been lovingly hand-knit, and a handful of hair clips still wrapped and untouched by time. 

Jacob, his voice soft and eyes rimmed with red, stood by her side and explained, ""Nadine, we saved these gifts for every birthday you missed after you were gone. Mom and Dad, and all of us, kept them for you every year. At last, we can finally give them to you ourselves.""

Her hand trembled as she reached for the princess dress, brushing the rough fabric with her fingertips. 

The texture brought a sting of emotion so deep she almost forgot to breathe. 

All this time, she had not been forgotten. They had always been waiting for her to come home. 

""Nadine... Nadine, my little girl."" Jordy's hand clamped over his ch\*\*t as a violent cough overtook him, and bl\*\*d spilled past his lips, darkening the floor. 

Even with pain twisting his features, a gentle smile tugged at his mouth. ""You came back to me, Nadine. That's all I needed. I can go in peace now.""

""Dad!"" Jacob lunged forward, catching Jordy just as he faltered, panic rushing into his voice. 

""Don't give up! Stay with us, Dad! I'm calling for help! Brad and Kaden aren't even home yet. We need you here!""

Moving on instinct, Nadine bent down and brushed her fingertips across the crimson on the ground. 

She lifted her hand, bringing it close for a quick sniff. 

Decadesleep Toxin. Only a handful of people in the world would recognize it--she did. Lethal, patient, impossible to cure once it took hold. Jordy had reached the very end. 

Someone had waited years for this. Who hated the Clark family so deeply? 

Now wasn't the time to search for answers. Nadine's eyes hardened with determination. 

She gently eased Jordy onto his back and, without hesitation, produced a scalpel from a hidden pocket at her waist. 

Jacob, frantic, tried to intervene. ""Nadine! Are you out of your mind? What are you doing?""

She shook her head. ""If you want him to live, trust me. I'm not letting him die here.""

There was no way she would lose the family she had just gotten back. 

Nadine dropped to one knee and sliced Jordy's shirt open in a single, practiced motion. 

Her scalpel danced with precision, never straying near anything vital, parting flesh and muscle to reveal the heart that was struggling to go on. 

With swift, practiced hands, she pressed the scalpel's tip to a series of precise points around Jordy's heart. 

Thick, inky bl\*\*d welled up and spilled out in slow streams. 

Each drop that left his body seemed to make his breathing just a bit calmer, the strain in his ch\*\*t slowly fading. 

Wiping her bl\*\*e clean, Nadine lifted Jordy into her arms and carried him straight to the neatest bedroom she could find. 

She moved so quickly, the entire rescue lasted less than sixty seconds. 

For a moment, Jacob stood frozen, mouth open, unable to process what he had just seen. 

Could this really be happening? Had Nadine just pulled their father back from the edge of death? 

Specialists from across Sheftol had all said there was no hope. Yet, here was Nadine, missing for two decades, saving their father's life as if it was nothing more than a routine procedure. 

How was this even possible? 

""How did you... Nadine, you... you're unbelievable,"" Jacob stammered, his voice shaky with awe. 

As soon as Jordy was tucked in and stable, Nadine turned, exhaustion written all over her face. ""Jacob, I need a place to lie down. I'm worn out.""

Jacob snapped out of his daze. ""Of course! Right away!"" He led her down the hall and opened the door to a bright, well-kept room.

""This has always been your room, Nadine. We've made sure to keep it clean every single day. You rest now. I need to call Brad and Kaden. They're going to be thrilled to hear this!""

Stacey lingered in the doorway, eyes brimming with emotion. Nadine smiled and motioned for her. ""Mom, come over. Let's share the bed.""

... 

Meanwhile, in a shadowy corner of an exclusive club in Sheftol, Rhys Bailey sat quietly, a cold, distant look in his eyes. 

A woman dressed to turn heads strolled over, her voice laced with bravado. ""Mr. Bailey, you look a little lost on your own. Want some company and a drink?""

Rhys shot her a glare. ""Go bother someone else.""

His friend, Nicholas Howard, let out a low chuckle from across the table. 

""Rhys, you really ought to learn a thing or two about charm. Are you really that devoted to your mystery fiancee, Nadine Clark? You have not even met her, man.""

Just the sound of her name made Rhys tense, irritation flashing across his face. ""That engagement ends tomorrow. I am done.""

Nicholas arched a brow, his grin playful. ""Calling it quits, huh? You think your old man is just going to smile and let you walk away?""

""I'll choose my own path when it comes to marriage,"" said Rhys, his voice cold as he slouched back on the sofa. His hand drifted to the scar over his ch\*\*t, lost in memory. 

Three years earlier, everything had gone wrong at the Urygan border. Trapped by enemies, left bl\*\*ding from gu\*\*hot wounds, he was certain he would not see another sunrise. 

Through a haze of pain, he remembered a woman's steady hands, a scalpel flashing in the dim light, saving him from death. 

He fought to focus, catching only a glimpse of her face before darkness took him. 

When he woke, she was gone as if she had never existed at all.

Since then, Rhys had unleashed every resource the Baileys possessed, searching every corner of Urygan. The woman who saved his life and captured his heart remained a mystery. 

Whatever agreement his family made with the Clark family, he knew what he wanted. 

Only the woman who pulled him back from death could ever truly be his. 


Chapter 4 Calling Off The Engagement!
Sunlight spilled across the sheets. Even before Nadine peeled her eyes open, a strange tension prickled her skin--she sensed two other presences in the room. 

Her hand hovered near the hidden bl\*\*e tucked in her sleeve, muscles taut and ready for anything. 

When she opened her eyes, nothing seemed threatening. 

Stacey and Jacob stood nearby, their faces filled with tenderness and quiet heartbreak, watching her as if afraid she might disappear. 

Stacey's lips trembled, and her eyes shimmered with fresh tears. ""Naddie, thank goodness you're still with us.""

Standing beside her, Jacob, tall and usually confident, twisted his hands in a rare show of nerves. ""You went through so much yesterday, Nadine. If you need more rest, we'll be right here.""

Frustration tugged at his features. He could not forgive himself for being powerless the day before. 

He had been forced to stand by while his adopted sister stripped the house of anything valuable and watched his father break down, coughing up bl\*\*d. 

Nadine had stepped in and held the family together. Without her, they would have been lost. 

To him, Nadine was nothing short of extraordinary. 

She pushed herself up, glancing around the neat but faded room, her gaze catching on a childhood portrait she could not even remember posing for. 

She had to get to the bottom of everything that happened. There was too much at stake. 

Why did things unravel so quickly after she disappeared? 

Who had been working in the shadows against them? 

She gathered herself and spoke, her voice raspy from sleep. ""Don't worry about me. Can you tell me... where is Dad now?""

Speaking the word out loud felt strange, as though it belonged to someone else. 

Jacob's entire face brightened. Hearing Nadine ask about their father was like a promise--she was finally letting them in. 

He believed, in that moment, she was here to stay. 

""Dad's doing a lot better. He woke up this morning and managed some porridge, then drifted back to sleep. I haven't seen him this peaceful in ages.""

He could not hide the admiration in his voice. Nadine had worked a miracle. 

""Okay."" Nadine nodded, though inside her thoughts tumbled over themselves. The Decadesleep Toxin remained a ticking clock inside Jordy. 

Her intervention yesterday had only bought them time, not a cure. 

She knew there was not much time left unless she found a way to cleanse the poison. 

Jacob broke into her reverie with a hopeful grin. ""You must be starving, Nadine. Mom's made breakfast for you. Let's go down and eat together.""

She offered a faint smile and climbed out of bed. 

At the table, Jacob hovered close, always reaching to pour her tea or pass her food, determined not to let her feel the slightest discomfort. 

Stacey never stopped watching, her gaze soft and unwavering, as if afraid Nadine might disappear again. 

After a long stretch of silence, Jacob finally gathered his courage. 

""Nadine, the Baileys have called for a meeting today about the marriage agreement."" His voice faltered with embarrassment, dropping even lower. ""We still haven't heard from Brad, and as for Kaden...""

A troubled look passed over him, but he squared his shoulders. ""Don't worry. No matter what happens, I won't let you be pushed into anything you don't want.""

Nadine placed her spoon aside and dabbed her lips with a napkin, her calm composure returning. 

To her, the whole marriage arrangement was nothing more than a minor irritation. 

""Send me the location, Jacob,"" she said quietly. 

Jacob stared at her, surprised. ""Nadine, are you saying...""

She gave a small, decisive nod. ""I'm ending the engagement today.""

It was clear to Nadine that if the Baileys genuinely cared about this alliance, the Clark family would never have been left to fall apart. 

Besides, whispers around town claimed that Rhys Bailey--the notorious heir from a family with a reputation steeped in shadows--was already in love with another woman. 

This was the perfect opportunity. The Clark family's troubles gave her all the justification she needed to walk away from this arrangement. 

... 

At the Stardust Cafe, Rhys sat near the window, a storm brewing just beneath his calm expression. 

His eyes flicked to his watch. 

Three minutes had passed since their scheduled meeting time. 

He felt only impatience for a fiancee he had never met and wanted this pointless contract dissolved as quickly as possible. 

He was just about to rise and leave when the chair across from him slid out, and a poised woman sat down. ""Mr. Bailey?""

Rhys' gaze lifted with a frown. But in the next instant, shock rooted him to the spot. 

That face--he could never forget it. It haunted his dreams and filled the empty sketches scattered across his desk. 

Years ago, bl\*\*ding out in an abandoned warehouse on the Urygan border, it was her face he saw just before the world went black. She had been the one who brought him back from the brink. 

Nadine, on the other hand, misread the tension in his eyes, thinking it was simply annoyance over the engagement. That was exactly how she wanted it. 

She slid a small box across the table, her gaze unwavering. ""I'm Nadine Clark. Let's not waste time. The engagement is over. You won't have to worry about it anymore. Everything the Bailey family sent to my family is right here. I'm giving it all back.""

Rhys felt his entire world tilt. For three relentless years, he had hunted for the woman who saved his life. 

He had thrown all of the Baileys' influence behind the search, overturned every stone in Urygan, and always came up empty. 

And now, the woman he had been looking for sat right across from him--Nadine Clark. His fiancee. 

Rhys' voice caught as he forced out the words. ""You really don't remember me?""

Nadine watched him with a hint of irritation. 

From what she'd heard, he had a reputation for being a player. 

She wondered if the talk about his S\*Ds was true as well. 

Pulling her chair back a little, Nadine offered a cool, mocking smile. ""No, I have no idea who you are. If that's all, Mr. Bailey, we're done here. The engagement is finished. Goodbye.""

She pushed back from the table and turned to go. 

Rhys shot up, arm outstretched to block her way. ""Who said I agreed to end the engagement?""


Chapter 5 That's Impossible!
Nadine gave a sharp, humorless laugh. ""What's wrong, Mr. Bailey? You're not on board with this?""

Everything she had heard about Rhys seemed true. He could be drawn to any woman, and his attitude made her skin crawl. 

""If this engagement mattered so much to you, where were you when my family was falling apart? If you have an issue, I'll go straight to your father and have the whole thing scrapped.""

Rhys knew words would not help him now. 

If he had realized the woman he owed his life to was actually the youngest Clark daughter, he never would have let the family struggle on their own.

He understood how empty those words would sound to Nadine, so he watched her go, powerless to stop her. 

But as far as he was concerned, the engagement was far from over. Not now, not ever. 

Pulling out his phone, Rhys barked into the receiver. ""Get me a list of every enemy the Clark family have. I want every single one of them ruined. Make sure no one can sleep easy until I say so.""

He hung up and immediately sent out another order. ""Prepare a formal gift. I'll visit the Clark family myself to apologize.""

Back at the Clark house, Nadine stepped inside and glanced at her phone when it chimed. 

A message from Rhys appeared. ""Whatever trouble your family has, I'll handle it.""

Nadine barely reacted, having heard empty promises like that countless times in Urygan. 

Nadine tapped out a reply, saying, ""Save your concern.""

Without another thought, she blocked his number and tucked her phone away. 

The only person Nadine could rely on in this world was herself. 

... 

In a grand sitting room at the Lewis family villa, Daniela buried her face in Lisette Lewis's shoulder, sobs shaking her body. 

""Mrs. Lewis, please help me! I did everything you and Mr. Lewis wanted. I tried to gather whatever scraps the Clarks had left, but now Nadine's come home and thrown me out! She called me a leech and even kicked me!""

Painting herself as the wronged little sister, Daniela leaned into her role as the victim, hoping to win sympathy and a new place in the Lewis family. 

In truth, she had done everything in her power to ruin the Clark family for the Lewises' gain, and now, desperate, she clung to the hope of rising higher under their roof. 

Blaine Lewis sat at the head of the table, his eyes cold as steel. ""Did you do as I instructed, Daniela? Was Jordy poisoned every day?""

Daniela nodded, trying to look as pitiful as possible. 

Blaine's voice thundered through the room. ""Then how do you explain this? Word is, someone kept him alive!""

Decadesleep Toxin was not something a man survived. Blaine had spent a small fortune to bring the deadly poison from overseas.

Daniela had dosed Jordy for more than a decade--he was supposed to be at death's door by now. 

Instead, Jordy had managed to eat breakfast this morning. 

Suspicion sharpened Blaine's gaze as he fixed it on Daniela. ""Be honest. Did Nadine save him?""

Daniela bristled, her envy showing through. ""That's impossible! Nadine grew up in poverty. She doesn't know a thing about medicine. Just wait--Jordy's not going to last!""

Blaine tapped his fingers against the tabletop, deep in thought. 

He had ruined Kaden, the Clark family's second son, and picked the family clean over the years. Victory was within reach until Nadine's return disrupted everything. 

She was an unknown threat. He needed to see her with his own eyes. 

Blaine looked up, a sly smile creeping across his face. ""Dry your tears, Daniela. We're throwing a business banquet tomorrow. You'll bring an invitation to the Clark family. Tell them it's a party to welcome Nadine back and celebrate their reunion.""

He had to find out for himself who Nadine truly was and what kind of person she turned out to be. 


Chapter 6 You Might End Up Needing It
A gold-trimmed invitation lay forgotten on the battered coffee table in the Clark family's living room. 

Jacob spotted it and grabbed it without a second thought. His expression soured the instant he read the name. 

""The Lewis family? I can't believe they actually invited us,"" said Jacob, his voice tense. 

He swung around to face Nadine. ""Nadine, we shouldn't set foot in that place! After everything we did for their family, you'd think they'd show some loyalty. But as soon as Dad's company started to collapse, Blaine Lewis couldn't wait to stomp on us. He swooped in and bought up our businesses for pennies, then went around telling everyone that working with us meant making an enemy out of him!""

Jacob's eyes were bloodshot with anger. He took a shaky breath and said, ""Honestly, the Lewises are the reason we lost everything.""

Nadine sat on the sofa, her attention glued to the latest message lighting up her phone. 

""Boss, I got the info. Turns out, it was Blaine Lewis who orchestrated Kaden's arrest. Plus, most of the Lewis family's recent wealth comes from trafficking people across the Urygan border.""

Human trafficking. That was it. 

Kaden used to be the best detective on the force. He must have uncovered the Lewises' crimes and paid the price for it. 

So this so-called banquet was nothing more than a setup to gauge her next move--the new threat they hadn't counted on. 

She slipped her phone into her pocket and looked Jacob square in the eye, his face still burning with outrage.

""We're going. I want to see what games they're playing this time.""

I just received my Hume Body Pod and did my initial measurements today. First of all, I really like the amount of data the app provides — hydration, segmental fat, muscle mass, visceral fat, etc. It’s definitely more detailed than most devices I’ve used.

That said, I wanted to share my initial results and get feedback from others here, especially regarding body fat percentage.
My situation:

Weight
Hume: ~188.3 lb
My regular digital scale: ~188.5 lb

→ Very close, no issue there.

Body fat %
HumePod: ~30–32%
Omron HBF-306C (handheld): ~24–25%
That’s a pretty significant difference, and visually / physically I don’t really feel like I’m in the low-30s range. I have decent muscle mass, train regularly, and my visceral fat index on Hume came back as “normal.”

Important context

I took the Hume measurement during a prolonged fast (no food, only coffee).
Hydration may not have been optimal.
This was literally day one, first scan.

From what I understand, BIA devices can be sensitive to fasting, hydration, glycogen levels, and water distribution, especially more advanced, segmental systems like Hume compared to a handheld device like Omron.

What I’m trying to understand

Has anyone noticed higher body fat readings when measuring fasted?

Do initial Hume scans tend to normalize after a few days of consistent measurements?

For tracking progress, do you focus more on trends rather than absolute % values?

Any best practices you recommend (time of day, fed vs fasted, hydration level)?

I’m not trying to bash the device at all , I actually want to understand it better and use it correctly.
 I’m genuinely curious how other users interpret differences like this and how your numbers evolved over time.

1q7chc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q7chc0/feedback_on_my_characters/,Feedback on my characters,"TW: VERY BRIEF AND MILD SUICIDE MENTION


Hello everyone. My name is Foxy and I’m co creating a book series and I wanted your opinions on the autistic characters I’ve got so far. Yuki and Jacks are twin eldritch antichrist children, Robin is a clone, and Angie is a superpowered human.

Yuki. 
Yuki is around 13 years old, Level 2/MSN non verbal dyspraxic autistic host and little of an OSDD system. They’re the twin of Jacks, foster sibling of Angie, Josh, and another unnamed child, and the love interest of Robin. They are part of a dissociative system, have some form of psychosis, PTSD and other mental health issues. He is AFAB, but faesari (uses he/they) and an asexual lesboy.

They are Japanese X Russian, but have been exposed to other cultures due to growing up in a travelling circus. 

They have a pretty big power set, but their main powers are necromancy, a form of telekenisis and the powers of the other mother from coraline. Maybe some type of kitsune powers but I haven’t worked that out yet.

Story wise their arc is learning that they don’t have to be perfect to be worthy of love and happiness and they’re allowed to ask for help. It also tackled their grief around age regression, the loss and dissociation from their memories, and their grief around skill regression. 
In the beginning, they have taken on the mantle of a vigilante whose death they hold themselves responsible, and at the same time is trying to achieve their parent’s dream of becoming an honor student and forensic pathologist. Nothing is going well for them. They are unable to keep up with the demands placed on them (plus they are so so bored doing it) they’re labelled as a violent, angry, destructive, troubled kid. They frequently abscond from class, get into fights, cause trouble, set things on fire, and have loud destructive meltdowns. 

When an unknown active serial killer case peeks their interest, they become dangerously obsessed with it, driven crazy from anger and boredom. 

Slowly, with support from their love interest and family, they choose to switch to an art school, but their perfectionist complex is extremely visible there, especially as they struggle to meet demands and are eventually expelled for being too high needs. Around this time their twin Jacks commits suicide and Yuki lose’s their powers. They’re then transferred to special education, where they grieve Jacks and rebuild their confidence with the loss of their powers and art school. They finally give up the vigilante life and follow their dreams to work in a theater and co author a book with their girlfriend, Robin.

Symptoms:

Both sensory seeking and sensory avoidant. Hates loud noises, wears headphones 24/7. Not particularly fussed about tastes, loves dim lighting. Adores pastel colors.
Completely non verbal. Does not speak, uses cat noises and chirping as well as a PECS board to communicate
Both hyperexpressive or flat. Doesn’t really show most negative emotions, unless crying, but is extremely hyperexpressive when happy.
Stims like crazy 24/7. Constantly pacing, occasionally bites themself, hits their knee, visually stims by looking at pictures, screams, hums, flaps hands, rocks.
Can do eye contact but really doesn’t want to.
Very socially unaware. Will bulldoze past any social cues while they happily chatter about their interests. They occasionally mask but quickly forget about it
Exclusively interested in their own interests. If not doing something they’re interested in, they dissociate, become destructive and elope.
Has big meltdowns. Crying, screaming, throwing, biting etc as well as looping. See good doctor I am a surgeon for idea.
Pretty “self centered”. Has very low empathy, no sympathy and compassion unless attached to that person, due to low theory of mind.
Has dyspraxia. Really struggles with coordination, super clumsy. Can’t tie shoelaces, writing hurts them, can’t dry hair or brush teeth properly.
Hyperlexic. Loves reading.
Their special interests are mostly fandoms and whatever ocs they have. Definitely art and character design. Oh and has a few morbid ones like poison or torture.
Has maladaptive daydreaming.
Pretty bad executive dysfunction. Needs instructions to be broken down into small steps.
Visual and Audio processing disorder
Has several ESSA’s and a service doggy named Cat.
Either loves or is actively uncomfortable around a person.



Jacks.

Jacks is the twin brother of Yuki, and the persecutor and protector of the same system as Yuki. They are biological twins, however their telekinesis blended their minds together at a young age, though they insist they are separate people. Jacks is the parentified caregiver of Yuki, and is basically a yandere. He struggles with control issues and possessiveness due to having an insanely abusive family, which can manifest in abusive ways. Throughout the story he grows more and more paranoid/mentally unstable which eventually results in his suicide.

They are Japanese X Russian, but have been exposed to other cultures due to growing up in a travelling circus. 

They have a pretty big power set, but their main powers are necromancy, a form of telekinesis and the powers of the other mother from coraline. Maybe some type of kitsune powers but I haven’t worked that out yet.

Symptoms:

Semi Verbal. Has unreliable speech. Often can’t talk, and even when he can it’s a huge effort and painful. Uses an AAC. He does talk very fast without volume control though,
Has regular sympathy, but low empathy. People are confusing.
Struggles with regulating emotions.
Very sensory avoidant. Loves kawaii, but wears black baggy clothes and has very pale colored plushies.
Impulse control issues. 
Stims quite a lot. 
Very socially awkward. Knows enough to know they are missing out on stuff.
Very social, kinda like Enid Sinclair from the Wednesday series.
Feels very little body cues.
His special interests are stuff like nails, hairdressing, and stuff from mainstream culture.
Has a flat affect.
Can do eye contact, doesn’t want to.
Happy to do something outside their interests.
Very standoffish yet protective of people.
Might have a learning disability



Robin. (I’m changing the names.)
Robin is the “14 year old” clone of one of the most famous vigilantes (For my sake I call him Batman) and one of his “love interests.” Batman’s love interest created Robin to help Batman with the loss of his middle son, Jason. However, Robin, then artificially 12 years old, wasn’t activated till decades later, which is when she escaped. Robin is the toxicologist and doctor of the bat family. Robin is a girl and pansexual, and unknown ethnicity. Likely white. She does not have any powers, but is basically the female and morbid version of the stereotypical sciency autistic genius.


Knows social cues but does not mask AT ALL.
Extremely obsessive about their interests, often neglects sleep and food.
Very blunt, has a flat affect, yet sarcastic.
Has ARFID. Survives off coffee, potatoes, and pasta. Hates sunlight.
Doesn’t really stim other than the occasional spin in her chair, or tapping her foot.
She is completely verbal, she just doesn’t want to talk to you.
Pretty “self centered”. Has very low empathy, no sympathy and compassion unless attached to that person, due to low theory of mind. She’s here to do a job as a doctor, and really hates it when grown ass vigilantes whine, and will be purposefully rough. Only one she’s gentle with is Yuki and Jacks.
Has a very strong sense of justice, and is okay with murder. 
Has shutdowns sometimes, as well as verbal shutdowns.
Extremely flat affect.



Angie, otherwise known as Angelica. 

She is the 16 year old foster sister of Josh and Yuki, a popular girl and cheerleader, and a high masking LSN autistic. She’s mixed but with unknown heritage, and a bit on the chubbier side. She’s a sort of a social chameleon character, showing different sides of her with different people. With teachers she’s the smartest girl in school, so curious and disciplined, and a good girl. With peers, she’s charming, friendly, kind, a bit motherly, daring, a bit reckless, and a bit more of a jokester. With her siblings, she’s more of a mother figure, a bit controlling, stern and stubborn. She often needs Jacks to act as a mediator. She absolutely abuses her reputation with people, like using her good girl status with teachers to get away with some devious shit, and using her charms to manipulate peers.

She’s probably gonna act as a mirror to Jacks, learning how to be less controlling and manipulative.

I haven't quite figured out her power set yet, but she’s an insanely competent fighter.


Very high masker. 
Has a lot of academic based special interests.
Stims subtly by tapping her foot, doodling, highlighting etc. She also uses food doe sensory seeking.
Sensory seeker. She’s a cheerleader, she loves tumbling and loud noises.
Scripts a lot of her conversations. Always avoids it unless she has a plan/ulterior motive unless it’s her siblings.
Feels really disconnected from herself.
Medium to high empathy, high sympathy and compassion.
Is actually hyperverbal, but just masks it.

The Sun owned the wall.

Not in the poetic way Mara usually allowed herself, but in the blunt, practical way of raw data and photons. A disk of impossible brightness rendered harmless only by layers of optics, software, and human caution. Even so, it still felt like looking at something that wasn’t meant to be looked at, only endured.

She hovered her hands above the keyboard and didn’t touch anything. A superstition, maybe. Or a way to prove to herself that whatever she was seeing wasn’t something her fingers had accidentally made.

Granulation crawled across the photosphere, the familiar quilt of convection cells. It should have looked like the Sun always looked up close: restless, boiling, self-arguing. Instead, the edges of the cells seemed… gentler. The contrast wasn’t gone, the motion wasn’t gone, but the randomness had lost a fraction of its teeth, like a crowd that had stopped milling and started listening.

Mara leaned back an inch and tried to force her breathing to stay casual.

“Did we change the deconvolution settings?” she asked, as if this were going to be a boring answer and not a turning point.

Jun sat at the neighboring console, shoulders slightly hunched in the posture of a man who lived inside instrument manuals. He didn’t look up. “No.”

On Mara’s second monitor, helioseismology data ran as a transparent overlay: Doppler shifts so small they were almost an insult, the Sun’s interior ringing mapped as delicate oscillations. The Sun always rang. It had a whole cathedral of modes, each one murmuring its own frequency, each one wobbling and wandering with the impatient heat of a star doing what stars do.

But today, one note had stopped wandering.

A narrow peak began to lift itself out of the noise floor, clean enough that her first instinct was to distrust it. She watched it for another cycle, expecting it to smear, to broaden, to behave like a real measurement inside a real star.

It didn’t.

Ninety seconds.

A second pulse landed right where the first had.

Then a third, like a polite knock on a door that didn’t exist yesterday.

Mara felt her stomach shift, not into panic but into the colder, steadier sensation of recognition: the moment your brain decides the universe has changed a rule and it isn’t asking permission.

She kept her hands off the keyboard and whispered, mostly to herself, “That’s… on time.”

**T+00:12:00 (Pulse 8)**  
*NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center, Boulder*

The Sun on the big screen was a false-color lie that told the truth.

A mottled sphere in blues and reds, annotated and boxed and translated into something a room full of humans could treat like weather. Under it, the real language scrolled by in graphs: solar wind speed, X-ray flux, proton counts, magnetic indices. The kind of lines and spikes that made satellites live or die.

The operations floor sounded like it always did, which somehow made it worse. Fans. Fluorescent lights. Keys tapping. The careful, professional murmur of people who refused to admit they were nervous about the nearest star because admitting it felt like inviting it to notice you.

DeShawn Patel stood with a coffee he hadn’t touched in ten minutes. He pointed at a plot that should have been ugly. Not broken, not dramatic. Ugly in the honest way the Sun is ugly: messy, noisy, full of little surprises.

This plot had developed manners.

“That’s not noise,” he said.

Across the desk, Liz squinted at the line as if narrowing her eyes could force it back into chaos. “Aliasing. Timing drift. GPS sync issue. You know the usual gremlins.”

DeShawn didn’t argue. He just asked, soft and surgical, “Across which instrument?”

Liz hesitated.

“Because it’s in two,” DeShawn added, and clicked the following window open before she could finish the denial.

A third feed came up—same shape.

A fourth. Same shape again.

The signature wasn’t just present; it was tidy—a clean pulse sitting on the data like a heartbeat drawn by someone with a ruler. Where there should have been a choir of half-coherent fluctuations, there was now a conductor.

Ninety seconds.

Again.

Again.

DeShawn felt his mouth start to form a joke, the reflex that made terrifying things survivable, and then he swallowed it like a bad pill. Humor could come later—first, accuracy.

“Okay,” he said, louder now, pitching his voice to the room. “Everyone pretends we’re calm.”

A few heads turned. A few chairs rolled closer.

“Call the spacecraft folks. Call the ground-based teams. Somebody call… anyone who speaks ‘Sun’ fluently.”

He didn’t have to tell them twice. Phones came up. Headsets went on. A contact list unfurled across a monitor. The phone tree began to light up in branching patterns, bright squares blooming one after another, like a nervous system waking from sleep and realizing the body was already running.

**T+00:33:00 (Pulse 22)**  
*Particle Physics Lab, University Office with Too Many Coffee Cups*

Elias Venn learned the universe’s bad news the way everyone learned the universe’s bad news now: through a rectangle that buzzed on his desk like an anxious insect.

The group text name was something aggressively normal. Physics Dept. Nonsense or Coffee Survivors. A place where people posted memes about grant applications and complained about undergrads calling electrons “tiny planets.”

The message pinned at the top was not a meme.

**SUN DATA LOOKS LIKE A CLOCK. 90s PERIOD. MULTIPLE FEEDS.**

Elias stared at it long enough for his brain to try its favorite defense mechanism: misread it.

Sun. Data. Clock.

He blinked once, hard, the way you do when you expect the words to rearrange into something less offensive. They stayed put.

His office was a slow-motion disaster: stacks of preprints, a whiteboard full of half-erased integrals, a paper cup with the fossilized ring of coffee at the bottom. He’d once told a student that laboratories were where humanity negotiated with reality. His office looked like reality had counter-offered, and he’d thrown the contract across the room.

He snapped his notebook open so quickly the spine creaked in protest.

The pages inside were not about stars. They were about barriers, potentials, and tunneling amplitudes. Sketches of wavefunctions leaking where they had no right to be. Coherence lengths like lifelines. Scribbles about coupled oscillators syncing despite themselves. Josephson junction equations like prayers you didn’t want to believe in but memorized anyway.

He read the text again.

Ninety seconds.

A clock. In the Sun.

The Sun was not a clock. The Sun was a furnace the size of a million Earths, a violent heat engine that made entropy the way lungs make breath. It did not permit neat, tidy periodicity on command. It certainly did not permit it across multiple instruments, multiple wavelengths, and multiple teams who all hated each other just enough to make coordinated error unlikely.

Elias felt the hair on his arms lift as if his body had decided before his mind did.

He muttered, “That’s entrainment.”

The word came out like a verdict. He didn’t mean it as a metaphor. He meant it the way he meant it in the lab: a chaotic system being dragged into phase by a coupling it cannot refuse.

He wrote two words, large enough to be rude.

**MODE CAPTURE.**

He underlined it once. Then again. The pen dug into the paper until the fiber protested.

His mind raced down the usual hallway of explanations, slamming doors as it went.

Instrumentation artifact? Across multiple feeds. No.

Timing drift? GPS? Aliasing? Across multiple independent time bases. No.

Natural solar oscillations? The Sun does ring, yes, but it rings like a crowded cathedral, not a single tuning fork. A new, dominant 90-second peak that sharpens instead of washes out is not “the Sun being the Sun.” It’s the Sun being forced to behave.

Forced by what?

That question was a cold coin he couldn’t stop turning in his mouth.

Without asking permission from his own sense of self-preservation, he wrote another phrase beneath the first.

**MACROSCOPIC COHERENCE FRONT.**

He stared at the words. His heart ticked once, and he hated how well it matched the idea.

Coherence was supposed to be fragile. Coherence died when the world looked at you too hard. Coherence was a candle in a hurricane, something you coaxed into existence in cryogenic silence and protected like a secret.

The Sun was not in cryogenic silence.

Which meant that if coherence was appearing there, it wasn’t doing so politely. It was being imposed.

Elias’ thoughts flicked, uninvited, to the old videos he used in lectures, the ones students loved because they made deep physics feel like a magic trick: metronomes on a shared board, starting all out of sync, then slowly finding the same beat. A hundred little machines, each stubborn, each individual, and yet the coupling through the board dragged them into lockstep.

He pulled the video up on his laptop. The metronomes began their clacking dance.

Childish. Perfect.

He watched them drift into synchrony and felt his skin prickle, not with wonder, but with the kind of fear that arrives when a toy demonstrates a principle you didn’t want shown.

Because the Sun had a board, too.

Its board was plasma, magnetic fields, pressure waves, and gravity. Its board was a medium that could couple motion across absurd distances if something found the proper handle.

Elias picked up his phone with fingers that didn’t quite feel like his.

He typed carefully, trying to build a sentence that didn’t sound like lunacy while knowing that lunacy was now a reasonable working category.

*Looks like entrainment / phase-locking. A chaotic system is being pulled into a single mode. If that peak keeps sharpening, treat it as a coherence cascade (mode capture spreading).  
Not saying “teleportation,” but in tunneling experiments, coherence changes what “barriers” mean. Nonlocal transition analogies may apply. Please don’t laugh.*

He hit send.

For a moment the office was silent except for the metronomes clacking on his laptop, steadily falling into the same beat, as if the universe were demonstrating his point with a grin he couldn’t see.

The replies came back fast, as if humor might nail the lid back onto reality.

*Lol, tunneling the Sun?*  
*Elias, go to sleep*  
*Can we not say “nonlocal” in an ops channel?*  
*This is solar people stuff. Stay in your lane.*

Elias stared at the screen until the words blurred.

He wanted to argue. He tried to explain that lanes were a human invention and the universe did not respect them. He wanted to ask whether anyone had checked if the 90-second signal was becoming more coherent, because that was the tell. Noise didn’t sharpen itself into a knife.

But he could feel the social immune system already working—the reflex to quarantine the weird idea so everyone could keep breathing.

He set his phone face down, gently, as it might explode.

Then he turned his notebook to a clean page and wrote the next line in the only language he trusted when fear showed up:

*If a coherence front can propagate through a star, then a star is, briefly, one object.*

He paused.

He added another line beneath it, smaller, as if writing it quietly might make it less accurate:

*And one object can be moved.*

Elias listened to the metronomes on the laptop as they found perfect lockstep.

Outside his office, the building bustled with everyday life. Footsteps. Distant laughter. The soft wheeze of HVAC.

Inside, he wrote until his hand cramped, because if this was really happening, the usual maps were worthless. Known probabilities were a deck of cards someone had just set on fire.

And Elias, for reasons he didn’t fully understand, had the sickening feeling that he had seen this kind of pattern before.

Just not at the scale of a star.

**T+01:14:00 (Pulse 49)**  
*DKIST Control Room, Haleakalā Observatory*

By the time the clock on the wall rolled past an hour, the control room had changed shape without anyone moving furniture.

More bodies, for one. People who “weren’t on shift” had arrived anyway, drawn by the kind of anomaly that makes schedules feel like a quaint superstition. There were extra mugs on the counters. Extra laptops. Extra voices that kept dropping into whispers, as if the Sun might hear them through the fiber line.

On the wall, the Sun looked… groomed.

Not quiet. Not dead. Still alive in every pixel, still boiling in the way plasma boils when it is being bullied by gravity and heat. But the texture had lost its animal unpredictability. It wasn’t that granules had vanished; it was that their borders no longer had that frantic, forever-falling-apart quality. The granulation pattern had begun to look like a field of cells obeying a rule instead of improvising one.

Mara tried to describe it to herself the way she would in a paper, because papers were armor.

*Reduced stochastic contrast in granulation. Increased coherence in flow patterns. Emergence of dominant periodic global mode.*

On the screen, supergranulation, usually a slow, sloppy drift of larger convection structures, was starting to hint at alignment. Not a perfect lattice, not something you could circle and label with confidence, but enough repetition to make the human pattern-recognition engine light up like a warning flare.

And then it happened again.

Ninety seconds.

A global Doppler shift swept across the disk like a sigh. Not localized, not patchy. A star-scale inhalation.

The brightness proxies didn’t jump. They breathed. A tiny, synchronized brightening that made the Sun look, for a heartbeat, like a single instrument being bowed.

Jun sat at his console with both hands pressed against his temples, as if he could physically prevent his brain from doing the math. “This is not solar minimum,” he said. “This is not instrumentation. This is not… anything.”

His voice cracked on the last word. Not from fear exactly. From offense. The Sun had always been the Sun. The Sun had always been predictable in its unpredictability. It had cycles. It had noise. It had storms. It had a thousand messy, overlapping clocks that never agreed with each other for long.

This was an agreement.

Mara didn’t answer him. She had the magnetogram window open, her eyes locked on it as if it were a crime scene.

Magnetic maps layered over magnetic maps, time stepped in minute increments. In normal days, the Sun’s field is a snarl of small-scale flux tubes and ephemeral knots, little braids forming and snapping and reforming with the impatience of convection. It’s a constant argument between motion and magnetism.

Now the argument was being mediated.

The small-scale tangles were smoothing out, not disappearing, but draining into fewer strands, like threads being gathered into rope. The low-order components were strengthening: a cleaner dipole-like structure beginning to assert itself under the noise, and the noise itself thinning as if someone were turning down the static.

“Look at the helicity proxies,” someone said from the left, breathless. “It’s dropping. It’s like it’s… combing.”

Mara’s cursor hovered over a plot: magnetic twist, braided complexity. The number should wander. It should jitter. It should do what all turbulent numbers did.

It was trending. Purposefully.

A graduate student behind her, eyes too wide, asked the question nobody wanted to touch. “Could the data be… being forced? Like externally forced?”

Mara felt Jun’s gaze on her, sharp and silent. She knew what he wanted her to say.

No.  
Impossible.  
Go get some sleep.

Instead, she said the only honest thing. “If it’s external, it’s using the Sun’s own couplings.”

Because that was the part that had settled into her bones: this wasn’t a foreign object in the frame. This was the Sun’s familiar physics… arranged.

Pressure waves. Magnetic tension. Convection. Rotation. The ordinary handles the Sun always had, only now someone or something had found a grip on the whole bundle at once.

Another pulse arrived.

Ninety seconds.

The Doppler sweep moved across the disk with the same phase, the exact timing, the same obscene regularity. Jun’s knuckles went white around a pencil he didn’t realize he was holding.

Somewhere in the back, someone whispered, low enough to pretend it wasn’t spoken.

“It looks manufactured.”

The words were quiet, but they hit Mara like a dropped tool in a silent room. She felt something cold and clean settle behind her ribs. Not the animal fear of impact or fire. This was a scholar’s fear, a curator’s fear: the dread of realizing that a category you thought was closed has just been reopened.

Because if the Sun could be marched into lockstep… then it wasn’t just a star anymore.

It was a system that could be addressed.

Mara stared at the magnetograms, at the orderly draining of chaos into structure, and thought of a door she had never believed existed.

A door with a handle.

And the handle, against all sense, was turning on a ninety-second tick.

**T+02:03:00 (Pulse 82)**  
*SWPC, Boulder*

The conference call had outgrown the term 'call'.

It was a living thing now, a many-headed knot of voices stitched together by fiber, satellites, and mutual dread. DeShawn could hear different kinds of sleep deprivation in it. The crisp, caffeinated edge of operations staff. The irritated fog of academics who had been pulled out of bed by a grad student saying the forbidden phrase: *You need to see this right now.*

Names stacked in the participant list until the screen had to scroll.

Spacecraft teams. Ground-based observatories. Solar physicists who usually spoke in measured caveats are now speaking too fast. Someone from an instrument lab who kept repeating, “We’ve checked the timing chain,” as if repetition could exorcise error.

DeShawn sat very still in his chair, shoulders squared, hands folded around a pen he wasn’t using. He had stopped trying to hide his tension because there was nothing to hide it behind anymore. The room around him was a hive of quiet motion, but his voice, when he spoke, stayed level. The kind of calm that came from duty, not comfort.

A woman from a spectroscopy team spoke first, her mic clipping slightly as she leaned too close. “We’re seeing narrowing of line profiles. Across multiple lines. Reduced convective and turbulent broadening. It’s not subtle.”

Someone else cut in immediately. “Same here in different bands. The line asymmetries are changing. Granulation signatures are… smoothing.”

A coronal imaging lead, voice rough, said, “Coronal loops are simplifying. Fewer impulsive brightenings. It looks like the field is being organized into a low-order structure. Dipole components are strengthening relative to the small-scale stuff.”

DeShawn watched the plots on his own monitors while the voices piled up like weather. Every ninety seconds, the same pulse. Same phase. Same timing. Not a statistical bump. A metronome.

Then an academic solar seismologist, someone who sounded like she’d been woken up mid-dream, said quietly, “The mode power spectrum is collapsing into a dominant peak. It’s… It’s too clean. Modes that should wander in phase aren’t wandering. They’re phase-locking.”

The word *phase-locking* hung in the air like smoke. Nobody liked it. It belonged to lasers, superconductors, and controlled experiments. It did not belong to a star.

DeShawn listened until there was a gap in the overlapping reports, then cleared his throat. The mic made his slight human sound huge.

“Okay,” he said. “So our current best description is…”

He hesitated. He hated the sentence and he hated himself for having to say it.

“…the Sun is syncing.”

Silence fell like a blanket thrown over a fire.

Not because anyone disagreed. Because saying it out loud was a kind of acceptance, and acceptance was a step toward a conclusion none of them wanted to touch.

In the silence, the old human reflex tried to crawl in: joke it away.

Someone, a younger voice, half under their breath but hot-mic’d anyway, muttered, “Maybe it’s aliens.”

A few people laughed. The laugh was thin, brittle, and died immediately, as if it had realized it was inappropriate in a room full of adults watching the laws of nature quietly change.

A senior scientist snapped, “No. We are not doing that.” Then, softer, almost pleading, “It’s not that. It can’t be that.”

DeShawn didn’t rebuke the comment. He didn’t endorse it either. He just let it evaporate the way nervous jokes always evaporated when the data didn’t care.

Another voice cut in, hesitant and oddly formal, as if the speaker had to introduce himself to a room that didn’t want him.

“Hi. Sorry. I’m a particle physicist.”

DeShawn glanced at the participant list and found the name: **Elias Venn**. Patched in by someone from a university group who had apparently decided that if the universe was going to misbehave, it could at least do it in an interdisciplinary way.

Elias continued, rushing now that he’d started. “I know this is going to sound insane.”

Three people began talking at once. Someone said, “We don’t need—” Someone else said, “This isn’t your—” Someone else said, “We’re on a tight loop—”

Elias barreled through, voice gaining steadiness as if fear had finally chosen a direction. “What you’re describing looks like entrainment. Mode capture. A coherence cascade. In lab systems, when enough degrees of freedom are phase-locked, the system stops behaving like a pile of parts and starts behaving like a single object. The coherence length effectively goes macroscopic.”

DeShawn watched the pulse hit again, right on schedule. Pulse 82. A clean spike rising where there should have been messy noise.

Elias swallowed, audibly. “And when systems go coherent, barriers don’t behave the same way. In tunneling contexts, coherence changes what counts as separable. It can make transitions… permissive. I’m not saying the Sun is going to teleport.” He rushed that last sentence like a man trying to outrun ridicule. “I’m saying this pattern is in the same family of behavior.”

A snort came through someone’s mic, loud and involuntary.

Then a solar physicist spoke, patient in the way people are patient when they are angry but civilized. “We are not tunneling the Sun, Doctor.”

Elias’ voice tightened. “I’m not claiming it will. I’m pointing out that the mathematical shape of what you’re seeing, phase coherence emerging out of thermal chaos, is not something that happens in large, hot, strongly interacting systems without an external coupling. Something is driving a global mode.”

That got everyone’s attention again because it returned to common ground. External coupling. Driving. A forcing function. Words solar people could hold without feeling ridiculous.

Someone from an instrument team said quickly, “All our timing checks are clean.”

A spacecraft lead added, “We see it too. Independent clocks. Independent pipelines.”

The room of voices shifted, not into agreement, but into the grim recognition that the usual escape hatches were closing. Aliasing. Drift. Calibration. The comforting catalog of mundane explanations. One by one, they were being marked unlikely.

DeShawn didn’t defend Elias. He didn’t dismiss him either. He knew what dismissal did; it made people stop sharing data. He knew what endorsement did; it made the room fracture into camps.

He did the only thing an ops person could do when the universe stopped behaving, and the humans had to keep behaving anyway.

“Noted,” he said.

Then, after a beat, “Keep him on the line.”

That, more than the laughter, changed the temperature of the call. You could feel it through the silence that followed.

Because it meant the crazy idea wasn’t being invited in as a joke.

It was being kept in the room as a contingency.

And every ninety seconds, like a heartbeat that belonged to no one on Earth, the Sun knocked again in perfect time, as if reminding them that contingency was not paranoia.

It was planned.

**Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** is the traditional practice of improving a website so that it ranks higher in ""organic"" search results on engines like Google or Bing.^(2)



* **The Goal:** To get your website link to appear on the first page so users click on it.^(3)
* **The Method:** It relies on keywords, high-quality backlinks (other sites linking to yours), technical site speed, and mobile-friendliness.^(4)
* **The User Journey:** User types a query → Sees a list of links → Clicks a link → Visits your website.^(5)

# 2. What is GSE (or SGE)?

**Generative Search Experience (GSE)**—often called **SGE** (Search Generative Experience) by Google—is an AI-powered search interface.^(6) Instead of just giving you links, it uses an AI model (like Gemini) to synthesize information from across the web and write a custom, conversational answer.^(7)

\+1



* **The Goal:** To provide the user with a direct answer immediately on the search page.^(8)
* **The Method:** It prioritizes ""extractable"" facts, structured data (Schema), and conversational content that the AI can easily summarize.^(9)
* **The User Journey:** User asks a complex question → AI generates a comprehensive summary → User gets the answer without necessarily clicking any links (often called a ""zero-click"" search).^(10)

# 3. Similarities

Despite their technical differences, both share a common foundation. If you have good SEO, you are already halfway to succeeding in GSE.^(11)



* **User Intent:** Both aim to provide the most relevant answer to what the user is actually looking for.^(12)
* **Content Quality (E-E-A-T):** Both Google’s ranking algorithm and AI models prioritize **Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness**.^(13)
* **Technical Health:** A broken, slow, or unreadable website will fail in both traditional rankings and AI citations.
* **Keywords:** While GSE is more conversational, it still relies on ""entities"" and keywords to understand what a page is about.

Post:

Hi everyone,
I’m looking for perspective on whether what I’m experiencing sounds like die-off (Herxheimer reaction) or something else.

Background:
I’ve had long-term constipation / slow transit, lots of odorless gas, pellet stools, bloating, and reflux symptoms. I suspect methane-dominant SIBO or dysbiosis (not officially diagnosed yet).

What I’ve been taking recently:
	•	Allicin (low to moderate dose)
	•	Berberine
	•	Mastic gum
	•	Magnesium (low dose, as tolerated)
	•	Some dietary changes (more fiber earlier, but paused now)
	•	Coffee earlier in the day (which I now realize may have irritated things)

What happened:
	•	Sudden huge increase in gas (mostly odorless)
	•	Gas felt burning / “hot” (not actual heat, but irritation)
	•	Then frequent bowel movements
	•	Then diarrhea
	•	Diarrhea contained floating orange/yellow material (looked like bile/fat or mucus)
	•	No fever, no vomiting, no blood, no black stools
	•	Symptoms came in waves and seemed to release pressure

I’ve since stopped all supplements and am hydrating.

Does this sound consistent with die-off, especially for methane patterns, or should I be thinking something else?
Has anyone experienced a similar progression when starting antimicrobials?

Thanks in advance — trying to approach this calmly and figure out next steps.",2,1767880339.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False
1q7cb8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1q7cb8i/the_struggle_of_am_i_good_enough/,The struggle of “am I good enough”,"            Sometimes I wonder if I do enough to be considered a working mom.  And not just a mom who found a loophole in work. 

      I’ve been a nanny for a long time but when my son (3) was diagnosed with a medical condition that needs me to be a watchful and “on it” , I was able to find another child (2) that I can watch at my home with my own boy. I only watch him only 3-4 hours a day, but oh man it feels like I’m just a stressed mom with two toddler boys who are always pushing each-others buttons. 
      Then when my 11 year old daughter gets home from school she babysits her brother for an hour as I head to my other job which is a behavior technician for only 3 hours and over there the kids can be sometimes more of a handful and overstimulating. I get home at 7:30pm and finish up bedtime routine. 


I feel like everything I do is just an altered way of just being a mom and not having a real job like a 9-5. 

It makes me wonder if I could even cut it in an adult job because I feel like my mind is deteriorating being only with children day and night.  When my husband get home I hear myself sharing the more boring things like oh today we did sensory play with rice or made a toy car wash , when he shares adult stories and adult problems about co-workers from his (scientist) job.  My co-worker is 2 and won’t keep his hands out of his mouth and then touches our couch. 

I moved across the country and a town that primarily speaks Korean and meeting people is hard, let alone me being a reserved and shy person at that. 

I’ve also spent a lot of time as a preschool teacher, I know they are stretched thin and know that I’m not comfortable having my son with his condition to be under their care… yet maybe.  I wish I could afford a nurse or something like that to be with him. 

I guess I need to be more grateful that my background gets to be exactly what he needs but still sometimes I just wish Id be happier throwing him in daycare and working for some thing simple like a fast food chain or a coffee shop and just turn my mom brain off.

Salty doesn't dress up as food because to him most salty food isn't salty by itself so credit goes to the salt crystals used, so his shirt is plain bc salt crystals. He's also just a cynical guy, poor guy has to sell fast food.

Sweet Queen had broad shoulders, that silluoette is inspired by some 20th century fashion where people were drawn with wider shoulders. 

I once tasted soap and it felt pretty bitter to me, so I decided to add a soap pipe to Bitter Boss. The other rulers have beef with eachother but Bitter Boss understands the most that they have to work together, his things like cocoa and coffee are really popular when paired with sugar, and he sees how that goes for other elements. Sour candy, salty waffles with ice cream, umami and bitter tea, etc, he's the most sensible of the bunch when it comes to this, but he is a mafia boss so he would do things like torture people to get information, which is why Sweet Queen is the actual most sensible, just not as sensible when it comes to her relationship with the other rulers. Strange how the Bitter one holds the least grudges against his fellows, right?

It's hard to understand what umami tastes like to me so I was perplexed at how I could make this character, but the more I thought, I began to think ""what is sweet? what is salty?? is shoyu sauce salty or umami? to me its salty but I heard its umami, but what's umami? have I ever tasted anything in my life?"" in this crisis I decided to just search umami foods, because I really searched foods their design is the most gimmicky, but I like it, they're kinda goofy and I think they should be The Fun One.

Sour Soveregin is actually sweet in personality, she's a bit aloof, naive and scatterbrained. She does have candy as her hair so I think it's justified. My sibling commented ""I like how Sour looks more like candy than the Sweet Queen, normally candy people are drawn really colorful like Sour"" and I felt very happy. I like the idea of a sugar person that is just such pure sugar that almost all her colors are yellow and brown because that's molten sugar color. We use food coloring a lot on candy but I think normal molten sugar has it's charm.

They were all just supposed to be side characters of another story about the 7 colors of the rainbow as people, which Sweet having the most screentime out of them because she's close friends with Yellow. Trying to think of a name for this story is hard, I was thinking of something simple like 7 colors in my native language(7 Cores) or Nana Iro which is seven colors in japanese but idk, it all feels basic, if you tried to search for it you might not find it if its called that.",4,1767880274.0,OriginalCharacter,0,1.0,False

Two days ago, my mom’s closest best friend passed away suddenly from a heart attack.

 She was only 54 and ill call her beth for the sake of the story. 
I grew up calling her Mama Beth even though we weren’t related by blood. she practically helped raise me. I spent summers on her farm, learned how to feed animals before i learned how to ride a bike, and watched her rebuild her life after her husband died. 

that ranch was her whole universe. she has a funny habit of using large speakers and keeps a good music all day long for the workers to enjoy working. Her favorite songs are ofcourse Carpenters 


what’s happening now feels like something out of a bad drama.

She hadn’t even been buried yet when her daughter and son-in-law showed up not to grieve, not to mourn, but to secure what they think is theirs. theyve been causing alot of trouble for the past couple of days.  news came like a wildfire. nobody worked. everyone is outside the the family house within hours of her passing,

 they were already talking about assets. About paperwork. About how things need to move quickly The same daughter who hadn’t visited Mama Beth for quiet sometine suddenly couldnt stop calling lawyers. the same son in law who once told her she was selfish for not selling the farm and ranch was now walking around the property like he already owned it. workers despises him. he keeps on asking everyone to do their jobs.


 and my mom insisted on staying as she promised not to go anywhere until her internment. she didnt want to sleep either and coffee is her new water. 

I was there with my mom when it happened as i was visiting my mom and Mama Beth asked us for tea. she was fine at first and keeps on teasing me for my new boyfriend. it happened so fast that i thought i was imagining things at first 

Back to the what happebed today.

The lawyer kept saying things like “estate management,” “intent,” and “future planning,” while the daughter cried dramatically on cue, wiping dry eyes and talking about how much her mother “would have wanted this.” Except everyone who actually knew her knew that wasn’t true. She had been very clear repeatedly that she did not want the ranch sold.

She told my mom that. She told the ranch workers. She told me.

Now suddenly the story is that she was conflicted and probably pressured by grief and wouldnt want the burden of land.

 The irony 
The ranch workers peope who showed up for her every single day, are being treated like obstacles now. I overheard the son in law say they were just employees and had no place in family matters.One of them has worked that land longer than I’ve been alive.
tensions everywhere. raised voices and accusations The daughter keeps saying she was robbed of her future, as if her mother wasn’t a human being with her own life and grief. As if love is measured in property value.
What hurts the most is how fast they rewrote her story.

She was warm. She was stubborn, yes but in the way people are when they’ve built something with their own hands. She loved that ranch because it was the last place her husband existed in real, tangible ways. Selling it would have destroyed her. And they knew that.
Two days. That’s all it took for grief to turn into greed.

My mom says losing a friend hurts differently than losing family, because there’s no protection, no rights just helplessness as you watch their legacy get torn apart. I see it now. The woman who survived widowhood, loneliness, and abandonment didn’t even get peace in death.

I don’t know how this will end. Lawyers are involved now. Lines are being drawn. But I do know this the way someone behaves when the body isn’t even cold yet tells you everything you need to know about who they really are.

And no amount of travel money will ever cover the cost of what they’re doing now.


If she sells the land everyone will lose employment and their life. 
I dont have a say in this coz im not a family member but i hate her so much that it will be such a relief if im only able to slap her like 5 times today. The fatigue is real and i dont know how to help my mom with the sadness . She lost a sister .

**Note** : The chapters I’m sharing aren’t chronological, they’re written in the order they resurfaced for me, not the order they happened.

**Chapter 1 : Sep 2012 - Dec 2013 :**

I arrived in Blois, France in September 2012, at twenty years old. It was a city I barely knew, a name on a map, a light I had seen only once during an open day visit. I had a suitcase, a bag, and that strange mix of excitement and hope you feel when you haven’t really succeeded at what you started, but you convince yourself that the next chapter will be different.

I had just left two years of business school. Officially, “it wasn’t for me.” In reality, I mostly had the feeling of disappearing there. I watched the others in silence: they seemed to know what they were doing there. I looked at the classes as if they were foreign objects, things that slid past me without ever reaching me. I wasn’t unhappy, just misplaced. Like a piece from another puzzle that you still try to force into place.

I had already left home, already come out, already fallen in love for the first time, already smoked my first joints. On paper, I looked a bit like an adult. Inside, I was still that shy teenager, unsure of himself, slightly crooked inside his own skin. I could feel that something in me wanted to be born, but I didn’t yet know what it was.

And then there was this program. A technical degree in web design and web development. Things I loved without daring yet to say, “that’s what I want to do.” I had always loved computers, video games, the internet, forums, sleepless nights tinkering with no real purpose. All of that had been labeled “passion” and not “future.” For the first time, the two overlapped.

I remember the open day very clearly. It was cold but bright, that kind of sky that promises nothing and yet makes you want to believe. Walking through Blois, a feeling hit me, silent and precise: this is it. Not a divine voice, not a big mystical sign. Something quieter, more intimate. As if the city recognized me before I even introduced myself. As if it were saying: “this is where you’re supposed to be.”

So in September, I came back. For good.

My apartment was on the top floor, under the roof, with an almost unreal view over the whole city. Rooftops, church towers, lights at night. Nothing luxurious: slightly warped walls, a floor that squeaked, a tiny kitchen. But it was my cocoon. I walked in, put my things down, sat on the bed, and had this simple, almost childlike thought: this is home. Not my parents’ home, not a boyfriend’s place, not someone else’s. Mine.

Very quickly, another quiet miracle happened: at this new program, I felt that I belonged.

The other students had habits, tastes, awkwardness that looked like mine. Some were shy, others loud, many were passionate, and all of them seemed to share this strange love of screens, images, machines, ideas. I had always defined myself as “the weird one,” and suddenly I discovered the new possibility of simply being normal among the weird ones.

The classes genuinely interested me. I listened, I learned things that I actually enjoyed. It was as if, after years of walking slightly sideways, I was finally putting my feet in the right direction again. I wasn’t brilliant, but I was good. And that was enough to build a new kind of confidence.

My life quickly organized itself into a rhythm that suited me: classes until late afternoon, then sports, then back to my apartment. On weekends, I still carried my social anxiety. I didn’t go out much. I spent a lot of time alone, and I realized that solitude didn’t scare me anymore. It was a space where no one judged me, where I could breathe, play, listen to music, listen to myself. My relationships with classmates during the day were more than enough, and I enjoyed the conversations we had during breaks, while waiting for or riding the bus. That alone was enough to fill me.

Weed had already been part of my inner landscape for two years. A quiet love, almost tender. In Blois, I quickly looked for it again. Buying it was an adventure in itself: the texts, the waiting, the slightly nervous walk to the address, the bus ride back with the little bag hidden in my backpack, and that childlike excitement of holding a treasure and knowing the next few days would feel even softer and nicer.

At night, I came home. I closed the door. I dropped my bag. I opened my little box. I rolled a joint.

The first one was always special. A wave of euphoria, warmth, almost magic. The music I discovered back then, the tracks my classmates introduced me to, added even more to that special moment. There was this intoxicating sense of newness and the feeling of being exactly in the right place at the right time, in that slightly too small room, with the whole city spread out behind the window.

I ate, I quickly worked on what I had to do for the next day, I smoked another joint or two, and I went to bed.

And life went on.

Little by little, I built connections. One very close friend especially, like an older sister. With her, conversations took on a strange depth: we talked about everything and nothing, yet behind it was the intuition that we were building ourselves together. I stayed discreet, shy, barely partied, but I felt, maybe for the first time, that people liked me as I was, without effort, without disguise.

Around March 2013, we started hearing about possibilities of going abroad for a semester.  I quickly learned that I was selected to go to Montreal. That day something vibrated in my body. A soft certainty: something is going to happen there. I didn't know what exactly, but I was ready to meet it.

Meanwhile, life in Blois continued with incredible serenity. The nights were beautiful. The moonlit streets were soothing. In my apartment, the smell of warmth mixed with weed and floating music. My body was young, strong, trained: five workouts a week, healthy fatigue, that feeling of standing upright without effort.

I stayed in a relationship I had been since 2010 despite everything, even though the love had already moved somewhere else. When it ended in the summer of 2013, it wasn’t a tear but a calm release. A space opening up ahead of me again.

The summer was quiet. Lonely. But filled with a deep peace.

In the evenings, I sat on my balcony and looked at the cathedral of Blois. The silence had a special thickness, almost liquid. With Emancipator in my ears, I projected myself far ahead. Where would I be in ten years? What would I have lived, loved, built? My innocence tasted like adventure. I vaguely felt I was only at the threshold. I mostly had the hope that great adventures were waiting around the corner.

Then the countdown began.

Five months left.

Four.

Three.

With my friend, we joked around to protect ourselves from what was coming. We smoked, laughed, made naive promises we wouldn't keep. I found myself becoming bolder, more alive. Montreal was taking shape on the horizon and I already knew I wouldn’t be exactly the same person there.

The last months were almost painfully tender. I felt comfortable with people, with classes, with life. I savored every ordinary thing: waiting for the bus with music in my ears, coming home late with the night clinging to the walls, smelling papers and classrooms. Even going to buy a gram of weed turned into a tiny epic: slightly dark apartments, low voices, lists of other drugs that fascinated me as much as they scared me. I wouldn’t have dared touch them. Not yet. I felt right at the edge of a world I was looking at without entering.

At night, I’d come home with my little prize.

I closed the door.

I smoked.

Music filled the space. My bare feet on the faux fur rug. The glass of water being put down, that small, sharp click on the glass coffee table.

Then time sped up.

Just a few weeks left.

Then a few days.

I woke up with nostalgia in my lower back, even though nothing was over yet. I was both happy to leave and already mourning what I was about to lose. I somehow knew I wouldn’t come back exactly the same. I realiwe now, It’s always like that: you leave a place, and you leave a version of yourself behind.

The day finally came.

My mother came with a friend. We dismantled my little world piece by piece. The furniture, the dishes, the things I had accumulated without noticing. In the end, only that strange emptiness of post-move apartments remained, that silence that seems to look at the walls and say: it’s over.

One last surprise evening with the new friends I had made this year. Slightly tense laughter. Promises without dates. Looks that say more than words. Then the station, the suitcases, quick hugs.

And the train left.

That evening, back at my mother's place before taking the plane to Montreal, in my bed, I cried. It wasn’t exactly sadness. It was something else. I kept listening to a song about growing older, and I somehow understood that I had just finished something.

I wasn’t only saying goodbye to Blois.  
I was saying goodbye to a version of myself, the one who was still innocently convinced that everything was only just beginning.

There was in that “everything’s just beginning” something immensely naive and immensely true at the same time. A soft certainty: simply the feeling that life was a long straight line ahead of me, still untouched, still blank, and all I had to do was walk along it.  I didn’t yet know weariness or repetition, or the tiny renunciations that pile up over the years. All I knew was momentum.

I truly believed there were only beginnings, that each step would lead to something bigger, more intense, brighter. I had this quiet faith in the future, in my own ability to transform without ever losing who I was. Nothing had yet damaged me enough to make me doubt myself for long. I was convinced that what I felt, that discreet magic, that sense of being in the right place, would repeat itself endlessly, in other forms, in other cities, with other faces.

I didn’t yet understand that some doors really close, that some moments don’t come back, that some “us” dissolve. I believed life was a constant ascent, a staircase without descents, a succession of openings. I thought I could accumulate versions of myself without ever having to bury any of them. It was sincere innocence, a naked trust that life was an adventure and that something was waiting for me somewhere.

There was a moment in my life when I truly believed that life was made only of beginnings, and maybe that's what makes that period in Blois so sweet: It was the last time I could believe it without lying to myself.",1,1767880076.0,self,0,1.0,False

i (22f) am an extroverted person but i have an intrinsic need for a certain amount of alone time and space. i get lonely really easily, though! my solution to this in the past was having a cat/dog bc i’m an animal person! however, my soul cat was rehomed (against my will) when i was 20, and i have never been in a financial/living situation since where i felt i could responsibly own a cat, and i also feel too heartbroken still to really want to. tldr: getting an animal companion has to be on the backburner for now. 

i like the vibrancy of being swept up in other people’s worlds (as long as i can retreat). i like doing chores with others, living parallel to others, having coffee with another person in the morning, going for a drink, etc. my ideal living situation is with (mutually respectful) friends. life just has a certain colour to it when you’re with other (good) people. 

however, last year, i was in a terrible living situation (renting from extended family who kept arbitrarily raising rent bc they could), where i would work long days (10 hrs incl. commute) come home and be over scrutinized and emotionally laid into for everything i did, baited into talking about politics and vilified for grey rocking, i couldn’t cook, i couldn’t clean, i couldn’t do laundry in peace, i could not ever feel at ease in a space that i worked so hard to pay for. i couldn’t go for a walk without it being a topic of discussion, and forget ever having friends over. setting boundaries was impossible. i am prone to anemia and it was a religiously vegan household — i tried to make it work but everything was me making an effort to accommodate, zero reciprocation, etc, i’m sure many of you have been in similar situations.

while i was there, all i wanted was space and freedom. i just wanted to be alone, to wear my headphones without being yelled at for not being available to talk to, to wash the dishes without being cornered about my thoughts on some kind of controversial political discussion, and i became convinced that i first of all, had to move asap, and secondly, that i had to live alone bc the thought of hopping from that into some kind of toxic roommate dynamic terrified me. 

but i’m so depressed and i hate it!! it would be different if i could have my friends over all the time, but my space is too small for that. i go out and do things often, i have my routines and rituals, i’ve tried to make it cute & cozy. even my ‘alone’ hobbies (drawing, painting, watching movies) i prefer to do with others. the only time i really need to be alone is when i’m doing my yin yoga, or when i go for long walks or go to coffee shops/boutiques (which aren’t even done in my space), or when i’m reading and smoking🍃 — i don’t even need to be alone, i just need other people to respect the vibe lol

ultimately! i just don’t think i have the temperament needed for this! i totally respect and understand that for some people this is amazing for them! but i’m the kind of person where, at work, i want to work beside and with others. i like having friends with me just to run errands. and maybe i feel depressed bc my space is cramped, dark, and it’s already a dark and dreary winter. but i don’t know how i’ll survive until my lease expires. 

does anyone have any advice? my only other plan is to just fill up my schedule so much that i’m only in my space to sleep and get ready. ",4,1767879768.0,LivingAlone,4,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I’m 26F, got an ACL repair in 2024, gained a bunch of weight due to my slow recovery post op. March 2025, doctor found gallstones during a stomach ultrasound, told me to do nothing, and I do nothing. October 2025, first attack, pain at 4am, I go to the hospital and then they give me painkillers send me home, I go back to get a scan during day time the doctor tells me to start planning surgery. 

I saw 2 gastro docs post the ultrasound, both suggested surgery. I told them I needed to plan it out and take off from work, they told me to stay low fat till I could schedule surgery. I got paranoid, ate barely any food next two months, lost 8kg, had one more attack during the time (after eating toast of all things lol no butter also) and I realised that my attacks are super random and even the low fat diet isn’t making sense. So I plan for surgery during my Christmas holidays (I don’t celebrate)

So fast forward to 28th night, I get admitted, my MRCP was way worse than my actual surgery and I begged them to sedate me and they said no because they needed me to hold my breath during the scan. It was the worst I was feeling claustrophobic plus crazy knee pain? (Idk honestly there’s no metal inside but the minute the MRI machine was turned on my knee started hurting like crazy) 
But yes after that they just did some more tests and I got everything done, slept and was woken up at 5:30am to get prepped for surgery. Was wheeled out at 8:30am, surgery was a bit delayed which made me anxious. I got taken to the operating room at 9 ish? They connected my IV and everything and gave me an oxygen mask, 3-4 breaths and I was out. Next thing I remember I was being patted awake and they told me it’s done, the pain was sooooo much lesser than I imagined. ( ACL was 11/10 this was around 4 or 5/10) they kept me in a recovery room for 2 hours monitoring my BP, ECG etc. then sent me to my room around 11:30am. I got liquids for the next few hours - coconut water, apple juice, soup and my first soft solid meal at 8pm. The next day was a lot of soft solids (im in india so for an indians idly, rice with dal steamed sautéed veggies, khichadi and upma) 
And I got discharged by evening on 29th. They covered the stitches in gauze but they told me to take it off the next day post my shower. The stitches are dissolvable internal ones so it’s been open wound since day 3.

It’s been 10 days today so I thought I’ll write this. I only had medicines for 5 days, and it was only a paracetamol sustained release pill for pain killers and it worked fine for me. I wouldn’t really call it pain it was just a soreness and it lasted a week, I woke up day before and it felt like my entire abdomen had relaxed. There is scab forming on the scars (dissolvable stitches) and some mild burning in awkward positions but nothing too bad. It’s been overall pretty good and I’m back to eating regular food (still staying low oil and butter for 2 weeks as per surgeons advice but I have coffee again so that’s nice) 

So for anyone scared of surgery I just wanted to give my positive experience if it helps even a little bit.

[\(Philissa Cramer\)](https://preview.redd.it/bfpa6zvpo4cg1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=5af9292fcf09e1d5782cddb2b9fbea539e6998d5)

Employees at New York City’s biggest Israeli bakery chain say they have formed a union — and one of their top demands is “an end to this company’s support of the genocide happening in Palestine.”

As an example, they cited Breads Bakery’s participation in last year’s [Great Nosh, a citywide festival of Jewish food held on Governor’s Island.](https://www.jta.org/2025/06/09/ny/when-it-comes-to-jewish-events-in-nyc-theres-a-new-theory-go-big-or-go-home)

“The workers refuse to participate in Zionist projects such as fundraisers that support the ‘Israeli’ occupation of Palestine, baking cookies with the ‘Israeli’ flag, and catering events such as the Great Nosh, which are connected to organizations that donate millions each year to the IDF,” the union, which is calling itself Breaking Breads, said in a statement issued Tuesday.

The employees at Breads, a spinoff of a Tel Aviv bakery with six outposts in New York City, say “over 30%” of the company’s 275 workers had signed cards in support of the union, which will be represented by United Auto Workers. They are alleging poor working conditions, low and unfair pay and a lack of “respect” from management.

But the workers also are calling on the bakery’s operators, CEO Yonatan Floman and founder Gadi Peleg, to end Breads’ ties to Israel. Both men are themselves Israeli, and Breads’ menu features items from across the Jewish diaspora that are popular in Israel, such as rugelach, challah, bourekas and its award-winning babka.

“We cannot and will not ignore the implicit and explicit support this bakery has for Israel,” Breaking Breads [posted on Instagram on Jan. 1](https://www.instagram.com/p/DS-v3tikTwM/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) in a statement that appeared in English, Spanish, Arabic and French. It said it had announced itself to Breads’ management days earlier.

“We see our struggles for fair pay, respect, and safety as connected to struggles against genocide and forces of exploitation around the world,” the statement continued. “There are deep cultural changes that need to happen here, and we need to see accountability from upper management.”

To form a union under federal law, at least 30% of workers must sign on. Now, if the bakery does not agree to voluntarily recognize the union, Breaking Breads can petition the National Labor Relations Board for an election to be legally recognized. It’s rare for unions to announce themselves at the threshold, more often waiting until at least twice as many workers join in as a show of strength and a safeguard against challenges.

A representative from Breads Bakery did not respond to a request for comment.

Breaking Breads declined to speak further with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, and referred back to the press release.

Breads is not the first employer to face worker demands related to support for Israel. In November 2023, about a month after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, five employees [at New York’s Café Aronne](https://www.jta.org/2023/11/07/ny/after-employees-quit-due-to-pro-israel-stance-hundreds-show-up-to-support-upper-east-side-coffee-shop) quit after learning of the owner’s public support for Israel; volunteers stepped up to help run the café.

In 2024, [employees at a Detroit bagel shop either quit or were fired following a dustup with management when their concerns about work conditions merged](https://www.jta.org/2024/08/07/united-states/a-jewish-bagel-shop-in-detroit-upends-after-staff-walk-out-protesting-zionist-new-owner) with their criticism of Israel. Earlier this year, workers at Alamo Drafthouse, a movie theater chain, [petitioned their employer not to show the film “September 5,](https://forward.com/culture/film-tv/688066/alamo-drafthouse-employees-petition-1972-munich-film-september-5-israel-palestine/)” calling it “Zionist propaganda.”

And in Philadelphia, [workers were among those who protested ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/08/michael-solomonov-philadelphia-restaurant-israel-antisemitic-protest)after the celebrity chef Mike Solomonov’s restaurant group, CookNSolo, donated to United Hatzalah, an Israeli rescue service, soon after Oct. 7.

Breads, too, staged an emergency fundraiser to benefit Israel shortly after Oct. 7. The bakery worked with the Israeli food influencer (and [now bakery owner himself](https://www.jta.org/2025/04/01/food/from-las-bo-re-kas-to-nycs-buba-israeli-bourekas-enter-the-american-fast-food-mainstream)) Ben Siman-Tov to create [heart-shaped challahs that sold for $36](https://www.jta.org/2023/10/23/ny/jewish-nyc-restaurants-win-new-fans-and-lose-others-through-israel-fundraisers?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to benefit Magen David Adom, Israel’s national organization responsible for emergency pre-hospital medical care and blood services. The bakery raised more than $20,000 amid a stronger-than-anticipated response.

Peleg and Floman also donated Breads’ signature black-and-white cookies to [a bake sale fundraiser that raised $27,000 for Israeli food relief efforts](https://www.jta.org/2023/10/12/ny/jewish-food-celebrities-hold-a-bake-sale-for-israel-raising-26k-for-food-relief-efforts) in the wake of Hamas’ attack.

“What happened in Israel was an act of pure evil,” Peleg said at the time. “What we are doing is an act of pure good.”

Such fundraisers would be prohibited if the union succeeds in being recognized and negotiates a contract reflecting its demands. So, too, would the ability of customers to order Israeli flags on custom products, which Breads produces for private events.

Breaking Breads is explicitly positioning itself in the context of Jewish baking labor history. In its statement, it says it is the largest New York City craft bakery union since the 1920s, [when Bagel Bakers Local 338 had roughly 300 craftsmen across the city](https://www.jta.org/jewniverse/2015/the-bagel-makers-union-of-the-lower-east-side). In the 1960s, Local 338 was nicknamed the “bagel mafia” after it prevented the Italian mob [from entering the industry](https://www.grubstreet.com/2020/01/bagel-mafia-wars-local-338-union.html#:~:text=Pertinently%2C%20the%20mob%20now%20had%20significant%20say%20in%20(and%20the%20ability%20to%20skim%20from)%20Manhattan%E2%80%99s%20two%20top%20kosher%2Dmeat%20companies%2C%20resulting%20in%20a%20spike%20in%20consumer%20prices.%20New%20Yorkers%20whose%20diet%20relied%20on%20these%20products%20were%20beside%20themselves.).

Breads Bakery employs 275 workers overall. In its statement announcing itself, Breaking Breads alleges a host of offenses, including deference to violent customers, failure to follow regular schedules for workers, and telling workers that they cannot speak Arabic in the cafes.

For some Jewish Breads fans, the union’s objections to expressions of support for Israel were surprising.

“I think it’s ridiculous to work for a Jewish-slash-Israeli-owned company and then be appalled by their policies and affiliations,” said Morgan Raum, a Jewish food influencer who has promoted Breads in the past.

Raum said the union’s boycott of events like The Great Nosh, for which she sat on the host committee, was especially galling.

The event on Governor’s Island last June drew 2,000 people and had a waitlist of another 2,000. It was not billed as a fundraiser for Israeli organizations, or as an Israeli food event — but some of its supporters and vendors are Israeli, and have fundraised for Israeli causes, such as supporting border communities after Oct. 7, providing trauma care, or providing rehabilitation and civilian reintegration services for injured Israeli soldiers.

Jewish Food Society, the Great Nosh’s lead organizer, did not respond to a request for comment on the Breads unionization effort. UJA-Federation of New York, which gave $500,000 to the event and also raised $800 million for Israel after Oct. 7, also declined to comment.

“I think it’s antisemitic to target the Great Nosh,” Raum said. “Tons of organizations and events are connected to organizations that donate or are affiliated with or support Israel. So it would be extremely hard to navigate anything, any event, any world in which you’re not doing so.”

And a few others..,"My family and I are planning a two week trip in 2027 to explore Germany. My husband's mother immigrated to the US in her 20s after he was born.

I'm sure in the last 35 years she's been here things have changed a good bit. So I wanted to ask my questions to honestly anyone with more recent insight.

We are from the southeast of the US. Which means we are accustomed to extreme heat and humidity. (I hate it here lol). We have experience in snow but not to the point where I'm going to want to sight see in frigid temps day after day. LOL.

1. **What time of year is best for sight seeing AND avoiding excessive crowds?** (we're not really interested in Oktoberfest- and as much as I would love to visit Christmas markets my anxiety cannot handle the crowds I've seen) but we do love fall weather. I'm hoping for a mix of outdoor and indoor explorations. Currently Cologne Cathedral and a few museums/castles are on the list - I have a few lakes in Bavaria I think would be amazing to check out. Visiting massive flower fields would be cool. (IDK if that is more of a Netherlands thing). We do plan to drive or take public transportation all over the country.
2. **Since we will be traveling all over - should we rent a car or do public transportation**? We live in an incredibly ""small town"" with less than 30k people. We are not familiar with any type of public transportation are are used to driving. But we are open to public transportation if it would be more feasible.
3. We are a family of 4. Our children will be 13 and 10 when we go. I would love to stay in something other than a hotel in every town. Are there things like bed and breakfasts there - if so are there websites to check them out? Air BNB? Are hotels bland AF over there like they are in the US? They all feel like a hospital. Way too sterile for my taste.
4. **How much would should I plan per person for meals per day?** I know this will vary based on where we decide to eat and what we order. Plus how big of an appetite each member has. But in general. If you ate out for 3 meals a day (whether it's just coffee for bfast, a quick bite for lunch and a nice sit down for dinner) what would you likely spend?

I still have so many questions and if you made it this far thank you. I know this isn't a travel sub but I figured no better person to ask these things to than you guys.",0,1767879265.0,AskAGerman,23,0.43,False

I’m after something real. Shared values, actual trust, long-term goals. Not into games, flings, or modern dating nonsense.

\*\*About Me:\*\* Music’s a big part of my life. I mostly listen to extreme metal, black and death metal stuff. Cradle of Filth is my favorite band, with Belphegor and Burzum right behind. I do vocals for fun and used to play with some guys (I have hit the drum set a couple times). Emperor's song With Strength I Burn probably has my favorite lyrics. You don’t have to love the music, but you’ll need to be okay with the sound, the shirts, and the wall art.

I work in IT, handling help desk support for the rest of the staff, and I’m starting to get into software security. I know tech pretty well but I don’t like to live online. I’ll scroll sometimes, but I’d rather be talking or watching something together than just sitting on our phones.

Been gaming since I was a kid. I’m into Dark Souls, Resident Evil, Timesplitters, and old Tony Hawk. Still down for Kirby or Mario Party with friends. I like board games that actually require some thought, like Betrayal at House on the Hill or HeroQuest. Other stuff I’m into: classic horror, building Gunpla kits, museums, occasional camping, and I’ve been slowly learning Japanese. I don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, or even bother with caffeine usually, not in a judgy way if you drink coffee (but in a judgy way of you smoke).

\*\*What I’m Like:\*\* Introverted at first but social once I’m comfortable. My humor’s usually dry, dark, or a little weird. People say I’m easy to talk to and usually pretty funny in person. I have a strong filter for quality, whether it’s people, ideas, or anything else in life. I don’t fake things and can come off as negative sometimes but that just amplifies the stuff I do like as genuine and not slop. I take relationships seriously. I’m not afraid of commitment, I just want it to be with the right person, someone I can actually build a life with. I’ll take care of the people I love. I’m reliable, loyal, and when I’m with someone, I’m all in.

\*\*What I’m Looking For:\*\* I want a serious relationship with someone who shares traditional values. Long-term, I want a dynamic where I provide and my partner takes care of the home and raises a family. If that sounds boring or outdated to you, we’re probably not a match. I’m looking for someone younger, ideally between 18 and 24, since I want a big family and the timeline matters. I’m most attracted to East Asian or white women with a slim or average build, obviously personality is king but we can’t deny that physical attraction matters. As such I’ve attached pics of me for you to judge.

\*\*Dealbreakers:\*\* tattoos, far-left politics, weed or drug use, heavy drinking, or being chronically online. If you’re into gaming, metal, horror, or nerd stuff, we’ll probably get along. I’m not expecting perfect. Just someone honest, loyal, and serious about building something real. You obviously don’t need to match me 100%, I’m open to trying new things (as long as I’m not doing substances) and hope you’re at least receptive to trying a board game or TCG.

1q7bvuo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q7bvuo,I Developed Tinder For Investing,"Hi everyone 👋

I’m a 28-year-old with a bachelor’s degree in Economics and a master’s degree in Financial Technology.

For a while now, I’ve been developing an investment app. I originally built it as an AI-powered analysis platform, but after realizing that most people aren’t very excited about reading long analysis reports, I updated it into a more fun yet still useful version.

When I looked through investment subreddits, I noticed that the main recurring question is usually something like:

“I have X amount of money and want to invest it for Y months. What should I invest in?”

I believe this app can help address exactly that problem.

The app is not just an “investment Tinder”, but also:

**Investment Spotify:**

You can group your investments into different categories (similar to Spotify playlists organized by genre or mood) and analyze their performance both individually and as a whole.

**Investment Chess.com:**

Just like how your rating on chess.com proves your chess skills worldwide, the app calculates your risk-adjusted return score and places you into a percentile ranking among other users (top 1%, bottom 20%, etc.). Think of it as a litmus test for being a good investor.

I’m open to all kinds of feedback — ASO, functionality, UX, anything really. Thanks in advance 🫶

If you’re interested, you can download the app for free via the link in my profile. For now it’s only available on the App Store, but I’m planning to release it on Google Play soon.",2,1767879163.0,AppStoreOptimization,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Today I felt so ass about going to school so me and my friend Y went out to a coffee shop up the road from school (just for the first period). 

As soon as we got our coffees my cousin F came in out of nowhere (she goes to the same school as me and she's in year 13), and she tells at me in front of other customers and tells me to go to school- she texts my sister M and tells her abt this. My cousin calls sister now as well and my sister began screaming at me over the phone to go back to school and now she says that she's going to tell my mom.

This is my last month with my sister until she's going to college in Cape town and I don't want her to leave with us being on bad terms but seriously she did worse shit while in school and I never told my mom about it. She's currently out of school and hasn't ever had a job not once in her life not even this 9 month gap between when she graduated from highschool and now when shes leaving for college.

I just got home abt thirty minutes ago and no one said hi to me.. my sister has gave me this smiley dirty look and I walked up the stairs and hid in my dad's bathroom. I noticed my home computer (an old laptop I use to play the Sims) was unplugged and gone from its usual place. I looked around for abt five minutes but I couldn't find it so I took all my remaining devices to the bathroom with me and some snacks and water from my bedroom that I share with my sister M. 

My mom knocked on the door and I though she was just gonna yell at me or try to git me or something but she said that I was grounded for 2 weeks and couldn't have my phone for any time when we were at home, and I could only take it to school and id have to give it back to her when she got home.

I was supposed to hang out with my friend Y tommorow bcz it was her birthday on Monday and I'd give her her gift and we could eat cake and whatnot.
But no.
No people over.
Not for 2 weeks.
Not until after M leaves.
I'm going to miss M so much. But she's narcissistic and 2 faced when she doesn't get what she wants... Just like my grandma and my mom.
The people at school. The randoms on the side of the road, my friends.
They all hate me.
But thats something I can relate to.
I hate me too.

Everything hurts.
More than normal bcz I'm on my period.
There's still glass in my hand from when my glass bottle broke in my bag and I had to clean it out.
The nurse laughed at me when I came to the nurse.
I said it didn't hurt.
I don't know if I can tell if it actually hurts or not anymore.
Because everything does.

I'm sitting here waiting. She'll take my phone soon.
And I'll break down even sooner.

I'm pretty sure my crush A at school likes someone else. Someone that I don't hate. Just dislike.

People at school call me nicknames bcz of my size.
And my acne.
I hate it all.

I hate the type of person I am.
I don't like myself or the people around me.
I miss my old friends.
The real ones at least so... Two or three?
I'm not sure, even now.

But I love my cat M so much. I think he's one of main reasons I didn't try to off myself much sooner.

I'm fat. Ugly. And dumb. 
What's there to live for anyways? 
So I can just grow old and die?
So that the economy can leech off me?
So that rich people can dominate the world and kill it?
So that wildlife disappears off the planet?
So everyone around me dies before I do?
Why?
...

Goodbye. Not forever but soon?

1.  I’m struggling with the sustainability piece, especially clothing. I know I’ll donate what I can, but the textile recycling cycle is deeply disappointing once you actually look at it. So much still ends up as waste, and it’s hard not to feel complicit. I want to save it all in case I regain. 

2. Add to that the sunk cost of money spent, materials used, environmental impact. Letting go feels less like “decluttering” and more like acknowledging failure. I want to be more sustainable, but right now it feels like there are no truly good options.

	3.	There’s also a quieter anxiety underneath all of this: fear of regain and fear of bone loss. I’ve become hyper-focused on gym time and weight lifting sometimes to the point where it feels almost compulsive. I catch myself wondering if I’m just trading one form of control or anxiety for another. Is this health, or is this just a different version of vigilance?

	4.	And finally, there’s a small but surprisingly sad loss: taste. Things I used to genuinely savor are now just… okay. Coffee, especially. I’ve been drinking and truly enjoying coffee for almost 40 years. My favorite flavor even as a child, part of my morning ritual, a flavor I loved in ice cream, cakes, and candy. I even enjoy candle scents. Now I still like it, but the pleasure is muted. It’s not tragic, but it’s real, and it feels like losing a tiny, familiar joy I never expected to miss.  On the other hand, I can’t get enough of cucumber. 

First world problems, I know, but all this to lead to my real issue: my mind doesn’t yet realize I am a size 6 and 125 pounds. I was a formidable presence before with the brawn and bold personality.

Question is, san kaya sila maganda dalhin? Around Feb 12-15 kasi sila darating. Nabanggit ko naman na baka crowded ang malls ng Feb 14 since Valentine’s day is being celebrated by couples and families dito sa Pilipinas. If ever, Feb 13 nalang daw kami umalis.

Additional Note: My boss has been staying in Thailand for about 5 years na so gusto ko naman maexperience niya talaga yung unique lang dito sa Pilipinas. I’ve been to Bangkok na rin naman pero wala ko maisip kung san sila maganda dalhin HAHAHAHA skip na namin intramuros kasi mainit, traffic, tsaka di sila mahilig sa ganun 😅 chill itinerary lang sana like kain, inom coffee, etc.

I'm not huge on dating apps – too many ghosts and flakes – so I thought, why not try Reddit? I posted in a local subreddit about wanting to grab coffee with someone who shares my love for hiking and indie bands. Got a few replies, but one stood out: this girl (let's call her Sarah) messaged me saying she was new in town, loved outdoor adventures, and suggested we meet up at a park nearby.

We chat a bit online – she's funny, shares some trail pics, seems genuine. No red flags. We set a time for last weekend, and I show up excited. She's even cuter in person than her profile suggested, great smile, easy conversation starters. We're walking around, talking about our favorite spots, and I'm thinking, ""Score! This could actually go somewhere.""

About 20 minutes in, she casually mentions she's ""super passionate about wellness"" and pulls out her phone to show me some ""amazing products"" she's been using. Okay, fine, everyone has hobbies. But then it escalates: essential oils for stress, supplements for energy, and oh, by the way, ""Have you ever thought about financial freedom? I have this opportunity where you can build your own team...""

Y'all, it hit me like a ton of bricks. This wasn't a date – it was a pitch. She was deep in some MLM scheme (think oils, shakes, the usual pyramid vibes). I politely nodded along, but inside I was dying. Tried to steer back to normal talk, but she kept circling back to how I could ""join her downline"" and make bank while ""helping people."" I wrapped it up quick, said I had to run, and bolted. Blocked her on Reddit afterward. Lesson learned: Reddit meetups can be wildcards.

We currently have the US Grant booked but wondering if there might be other options that better fit our needs.  Some details of our stay and what we're looking for:

* We have a 2 yr old and 5 yr old - they're well behaved, but kids (is US Grant too stuffy?) - looking for somewhere safe to walk around nearby that is close to restaurants, coffee shops, etc. - we'll have a rental car but would rather not be constantly in and out of the car and dealing with car seats
* Staying Friday to Sunday
* Pool would be a bonus but not necessary
* On-site parking is preferred
* Do not need beach proximity - we live by the beach at home so that's not important for this trip
* Hoping to stay on points (currently have the US Grant booked on points)

Editing to add: Based on amenities, points value, location, and pictures alone, I'm considering switching to either the Alma (looks nice and I like that the pool has a large first step/shallow entry for the kids and in the same area as the US Grant) and the Westin Bayview (the outside grassy area looks good for the kids over the usual concrete and still nearby).  Any thoughts on either of these? Or others you'd suggest?

I will say the Marquis is a little more points than we currently have but would consider paying cash if it is worth it, but looking at the map it looks more out of the way than some of the others - is that true or is there plenty to do nearby? (Again, total SD newbie!) Location and walkability is more important to us than pool as we'll be spending 4 days in DL after and really looking to spend our time in SD exploring the city.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1q7bg3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/HelpMeFind/comments/1q7bg3k/lgbtq_lesbian_novel/,LGBTQ+ Lesbian Novel,"Hello everyone! I have been looking for a book since 2020, and I was hoping you guys might know the title/author! The book was an original story on Wattpad but I can’t find it for the life of me and I am hoping it still exists somewhere. The book is about a post-apocalyptic America (I believe it was a civil war) after which a religious order took over based on the Old Testament (or the book's version of the Old Testament).

As part of its system, each man is titled Adam (but he has his own name which he is referred to at times, I believe it was Luke but I might be wrong) and are given multiple wives titled with a quality associated with Eve (these qualities were picked out of a verse either from the Old Testament/the author making up a verse and associating it with the old Testament). For some reason, I have a list of the qualities: True, Endure, Honor, Amiable, Able, Brave, Lucid, Patience, Compassion, Gentle, Beauty, Fruitful (so a woman would be titled 'Eve Endure', but usually they are just called by their quality). So each man has an Eve Endure, Eve beauty and so on. I don't recall why the system is set up this way, perhaps to get the population up?

The story focuses on a specific family in which the main character, Endure, falls in love with Able. This is found out and Able is taken away (basically, I believe as a means to entrench control and legitimise the religious order, a tradition is that every month (or maybe more often) each Adam is to sleep with a different wife (probably to make children), and while that is happening, the other wives sleep with each other. To ensure the wives aren't actually enjoying it, they are closely monitored with machinery. This sounds INSANE but it made more sense in the book! Able and Endure are assigned to each other one month and Able orgasms, and as she is the only one to do so, she is the only one taken away because she is the only one believed to be gay (being gay is a sin under this system).

The story is about how Endure and Able find each other and escape to the border, but also looks at the dynamic between all the wives and their relationship with Adam (who is not described as a bad person, but a victim of the system like them). I believe in the end, Adam loses all his wives except Beauty (who has developed this illness which causes her pain everywhere after childbirth). I believe Beauty's daughter/ or one of the other wives' daughter, was declared special and taken away to become a priestess (which is not good either because although she isn't forced to be a wife or have children, she will basically be trapped forever- she doesn't get a choice either way).

It was a beautifully written story and means so much to me (evidenced by the fact that I have been looking for it for years even though I believe I read it in 2017). I hope someone can help me find it! I recall the author talking about winning an award on Wattpad and finding out at a coffee shop and almost dropping their coffee. I emailed Wattpad, asking for historical records of Wattys winners, but they said no, so that is a dead end, unfortunately.

I'm not huge on dating apps – too many ghosts and flakes – so I thought, why not try Reddit? I posted in a local subreddit about wanting to grab coffee with someone who shares my love for hiking and indie bands. Got a few replies, but one stood out: this girl (let's call her Sarah) messaged me saying she was new in town, loved outdoor adventures, and suggested we meet up at a park nearby.

We chat a bit online – she's funny, shares some trail pics, seems genuine. No red flags. We set a time for last weekend, and I show up excited. She's even cuter in person than her profile suggested, great smile, easy conversation starters. We're walking around, talking about our favorite spots, and I'm thinking, ""Score! This could actually go somewhere.""

About 20 minutes in, she casually mentions she's ""super passionate about wellness"" and pulls out her phone to show me some ""amazing products"" she's been using. Okay, fine, everyone has hobbies. But then it escalates: essential oils for stress, supplements for energy, and oh, by the way, ""Have you ever thought about financial freedom? I have this opportunity where you can build your own team...""

Y'all, it hit me like a ton of bricks. This wasn't a date – it was a pitch. She was deep in some MLM scheme (think oils, shakes, the usual pyramid vibes). I politely nodded along, but inside I was dying. Tried to steer back to normal talk, but she kept circling back to how I could ""join her downline"" and make bank while ""helping people."" I wrapped it up quick, said I had to run, and bolted. Blocked her on Reddit afterward. Lesson learned: Reddit meetups can be wildcards.

Has this happened to anyone else? How do you vet people better without being paranoid? I feel like I wasted my afternoon, but at least it wasn't a total catfish.

On a brighter note, this whole fiasco got me thinking about better ways to connect with people IRL without the hidden agendas. That's actually why I built my app, Nearlly – it's a proximity-based social networking thing where folks post their actual plans or purposes upfront (like ""hiking buddy wanted at \[park\] this Saturday"" or ""coffee chat about indie music?""). No swiping, no endless DMs – just real-time, nearby strangers linking up based on shared intentions. It's helped me dodge the BS and meet genuine people for hangouts, events, or even dates.

Specifically: Do you think deeper at home, in a less crowded coffee shop? Do you have Home or Personal reflections at unusual places (like at Work or during a Work schedule if WFH)? 

Where do you have certain thoughts and why? I'm curious to see how a certain environment and personality type (extroverted journallers) reflect which type of thoughts and on what place they write it in.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Popcorn chicken with tator tots

Corn chips with pico de Gallo

This is my diet 80% of the month. I actually love new foods and textures but once or twice and I'm no longer interested in trying it again. 

Of note, I do have alpha gal. Basically I was bit by a tick that made me allergic to mammal based meats and their byproducts (milk, some sugars, cheese, some medications etc) so that does limit my diet. I was living off a coffee flavored protein drink prior. So for me to suggest alpha gal has changed my eating much is not accurate but does play into my ""rut.""

My question is this. My nurse suggested I see a nutritionist. I'm not exactly apposed to this in practice but in reality they were of little help in the past when I had severe gi issues. Have they been helpful for autistic specific concerns?

Also any good vegan friendly supplements?  My iron is actually really good but b12 and D3 were extremely low. The d3 my insurance covers is mammilian based

I'm not huge on dating apps – too many ghosts and flakes – so I thought, why not try Reddit? I posted in a local subreddit about wanting to grab coffee with someone who shares my love for hiking and indie bands. Got a few replies, but one stood out: this girl (let's call her Sarah) messaged me saying she was new in town, loved outdoor adventures, and suggested we meet up at a park nearby.

We chat a bit online – she's funny, shares some trail pics, seems genuine. No red flags. We set a time for last weekend, and I show up excited. She's even cuter in person than her profile suggested, great smile, easy conversation starters. We're walking around, talking about our favorite spots, and I'm thinking, ""Score! This could actually go somewhere.""

About 20 minutes in, she casually mentions she's ""super passionate about wellness"" and pulls out her phone to show me some ""amazing products"" she's been using. Okay, fine, everyone has hobbies. But then it escalates: essential oils for stress, supplements for energy, and oh, by the way, ""Have you ever thought about financial freedom? I have this opportunity where you can build your own team...""

Y'all, it hit me like a ton of bricks. This wasn't a date – it was a pitch. She was deep in some MLM scheme (think oils, shakes, the usual pyramid vibes). I politely nodded along, but inside I was dying. Tried to steer back to normal talk, but she kept circling back to how I could ""join her downline"" and make bank while ""helping people."" I wrapped it up quick, said I had to run, and bolted. Blocked her on Reddit afterward. Lesson learned: Reddit meetups can be wildcards.

Has this happened to anyone else? How do you vet people better without being paranoid? I feel like I wasted my afternoon, but at least it wasn't a total catfish.

On a brighter note, this whole fiasco got me thinking about better ways to connect with people IRL without the hidden agendas. That's actually why I built my app, Nearlly – it's a proximity-based social networking thing where folks post their actual plans or purposes upfront (like ""hiking buddy wanted at \[park\] this Saturday"" or ""coffee chat about indie music?""). No swiping, no endless DMs – just real-time, nearby strangers linking up based on shared intentions. It's helped me dodge the BS and meet genuine people for hangouts, events, or even dates. If you're tired of Reddit roulette or app fatigue, check it out – it's free to try, and who knows, maybe you'll avoid your own MLM ambush. Sharing the link if anyone’s curious - https://linktr.ee/nearlly?utm\_source=linktree\_profile\_share&ltsid=41352317-3316-4b51-8811-4f2e9ad636a7

---

**6:42 AM.**

Today I woke up with a dry mouth and that state where the brain processes that it was a dream, today the dream was the same as since January 8th: clicky voices, the deep smell of salt and one of them with that strange look calling me something that involved being hot.

I turned the TV on at maximum volume, and while I brushed my teeth I listened to the journalist.

“...and so, for the third consecutive week, the rate of adherence to the Tiamat enzyme exceeds 89% in all Integration Zones! Humanity is reborn! Since January 8th of this year, human life changed forever, an alien species landed on Earth seeking shelter, we gave ourselves and in return they helped us with everything, starting with dissolving all current governments and then cur-.""


Isabel grumbled from the top bunk and threw a pillow at me, and I grumbled as I grabbed the remote and turned off the TV.

— “Damn it, Sebas!* Turn that off, please!”

She sat down, her black hair messy, her eyes still swollen but with that soft glow that only appears after someone takes the possessive enzyme. Isabel Morales, 24 years old, from Oaxaca. She arrived three days before the Ark entered orbit. Now, she shares with me a ""temporary human enclosure,"" as the Thalassari call it with that chilling delicacy.


— “Just take the enzyme, man.”


she said, rubbing her eyes.

“You look like a ghost. And I don’t want to be the only one with a green badge in this hole.”
She craned her neck. The badge glowed a radioactive green, the kind you see in a child's drawing.

""Trusted Human.""
Written in large letters, meaningful enough for a human to understand and alien enough for a Thala to understand.

""Not mandatory... for now,"" I said, stirring my cold coffee.


""It's not, but it's smart. My aunt in Chiapas is alive again, Sebas. She had a disease I can't even pronounce for two years, and now she's planting corn with her own hands because a **Guardian** passed by and cured everyone in the community without charging, see-without... without asking for anything! They just set up camp there.""

Guardian—that's how the Thalassari referred to themselves now. Never ""commanders."" Never ""lords."" Always “guardians” as if we had already agreed that we needed to be guarded and protected.

— “They ask,” I murmured, finishing my cold coffee. “They just don’t charge in money.”

She looked deep into my eyes with those two pearls that each day became more like theirs. Not with anger, with pity.

— “You’re seeing malice in genuine kindness, man. Take the enzyme at least to stop dreaming about the bottom of the sea you’ve been in since the Thala arrived.”

**8:07 AM.**

I left the room.


The city where tourists from New York always came to spend the night is now called ""Vermara,"" a name chosen in homage to ""Verm'ara,"" the legendary City of Singing Corals, destroyed in the Great Betrayal: an event that, from what I understand, resulted in the near extinction and flight to land of these fish-faced people.


The streets are clean, without a single dirty or poorly lit alley, but what bothers me most is the silence. There are no shouts, no loud music, only the sounds of thala doing strange things inside the barges, a deep, guttural sound that makes the chest vibrate.


I pass by a mixed couple: a Thala in a gray uniform and a human woman with phosphorescent green eyes. The Thala holds her hand carefully, as if afraid of crushing it, and whether he wants to or not, that could happen. Poor politician from the East who thought he could insult one of these monsters and get away with it; his hand crumbled in a handshake that was ""accidentally too strong.""

She smiles, tilts her head… but it doesn't seem natural—I mean, what in this world seems natural after the arrival of the Thalas?


They've been here for three and a half weeks. Nobody here is really in love, just learning to pretend.


And that's when I realized something funny: you couldn't tell if it was male or female: even from behind, even with the tight uniform.

Muscular body, long tail, firm and voluminous chest... Everything is the same in everyone, because from what I understood in the books they gave as if they were pamphlets for a ball, the reason for this is that they evolved to completely divide the role of creation, taking away the fact of conceiving, that is, they do not have, in the human sense, the definition of woman and man.
The only part that perhaps is what you do to differentiate them is that their eyes were different, the colors are always warm or cold, perhaps a way to differentiate them.

**9:18 AM.**

I get close to the old industrial district, partially demolished to get in touch with the nearby ocean, now it's ""Maritime Zone 23"".

This is where the Thalassari set up their ""logistical support"" camp, tents of live coral. I've never seen one, and it's basically a thin coral that looks like a tent-shaped fabric. Now put beings 5 ​​to 6 meters tall inside, and there you have it, their tent. The Thalassaris circulated with relaxed postures and clothes that theoretically would be casual, but which only look like the clothes soldiers wear underneath the universe. Everything about them indicated civilians; after all, they didn't make any distinction when they went to look at the ""Ark."" What makes me wonder is that their eyes were always scanning the surroundings.

I hide behind a container marked with the symbol of the Ark—a spiral with eyes. I don't know why I was here, but since I was, I would satisfy my curiosity and maybe end my paranoia, or just reinforce it. Regardless, it will be interesting.

Amidst the matter carrying orders in their language, that's where I hear it.

Not everything.
Just fragments.
As if the wind were choosing what I can let hear.

“...Zone 23 still resists. Greater... refusal to the continent's enzyme.”

“...no... force... Council forbade.”

“...then that... Release... Therak... ancient sewer... ""Environmental accident""...”
“...Begging for protection... protection... tastes like calm.”

They stop when a sound of water crashing against the earth is heard, as if one of them had arrived and this one also seems to conspire
""...after they accept the bond... They never... thought alone.”*

My blood ran cold.


Zone 23 was... My neighborhood! Okay, calm down. None of this makes complete sense, but it's enough to make my stomach churn.


Because now I know: I was right, they had ulterior motives, they are evil! But... Regardless of who I tell, it wouldn't change anything.


I stand still for so long that I almost don't notice when I turn around. You know, their skin, being basically sharks, is colder than human skin, around 20 degrees Celsius with lower sensations. And why am I talking about this? Simple, I didn't notice the cold spreading, and while I was preparing to move, my shoulder bumps into something that doesn't give way, cold as wet steel, hard as living stone. Before I can move away, a hand grabs me by the neck. It doesn't squeeze. It just… prevents it, and that alone makes it seem worse. And then, a voice as low as the bottom of the sea speaks as if it were a lieutenant giving orders to a Brazilian soldier, reverberating within me:


""You, human, what are you doing here, listening to conversations between soldiers? Have you lost your mind?""

Instead, he went to get the car washed, blew leaves off the driveway, and washed most of the dishes **except** the knives. (We laugh about it, I'm not making fun of him.)

I'm behind schedule a bit, but still hoping to hit my goal of having the house semi-presentable by Jan 15th.

F32 pregnant with third M31,"I’m married to my husband with 2 children and we just found out I was pregnant. (So yes I’m sensitive but please hear me out- I want kindness and love from family not rude comments)

For months, I’ve been getting mean comments from multiple women in my husbands family. 

He’s not mad at them for being rude to me. 
He is mad at me for seeing through their bullshit and “ not liking them” after being mean to me. 

if an example is needed: his soon to be sister in law (girl engaged to his brother) always makes unsolicited comments on my appearance, my kids and sisters looks… she does this in subtle coercive ways through always appearing chill and laid back but will drop 2-3 “negging” remarks. They’ve all added up and now I feel like she has some secret dislike or maybe even jealousy causing her to make those comments. 

Another example: my husband’s girl cousin hosted us for dinner over the holidays. She didn’t greet us kindly with “hey guys how was the drive” 
She goes “great now my dog is going to get run over and killed” bc we walked in the back door after trying to get a hold of her for 10 mins. Later that night she called me “childish” and talked down to me like she does her own children for sitting on their back porch alone and crying. Mind you, their whole family was watching Ohio state football but I snuck  away to call my mom bc she was very sick.
My husband didn’t say anything about her comments he just confirmed “her mom is very sick” 

She also makes smart Alec remarks at me when I’m politely asking her questions. She’s loud competitive and intense. I’m generally introverted and do things for fun not competition. I think we’re so different and don’t mesh well but since day 1 tried to assert dominance over me for some weird reason: at our first baby shower she asked me if she could “steal my husband/her cousin” to go get coffee with him… I’m like uhm weird timing and weird thing to do but ok. 

His grandma: 👵🏼 our baby was fussy and she instantly asks if my “milk has dried out” mind you, I breastfed our first until 3.5 years old lol. His grandpa called me “middle age” (I’m 32 years old) and his grandma told me on Christmas morning “you’re lucky to have my grandson” …. Bc he was up all night wrapping our extra Santa gifts. At that point I thought fuck it and these ppl and said “I packed our bags and majority of gifts, I am up with our babies every night of the year. He is lucky to have me. We are lucky to have each other”

Bruh after all these people in his life have been unnecessarily unkind to me I’m left wondering why. I go into relationships with people hoping for the best (that my future sister in law could be my bestie) but she’s rotting our connection by simply being passive aggressive and rude. I am tired by them getting involved in my own emotions and when I run to my husband for advice he shuts it down and tells me not to think of it at all. I told him I stopped having  feelings when I caught his porn addiction. He told me last night that he realized he didn’t like me when I came to him upset about his future sister in law bullying me.  My husband’s big and strong so no one messes with him and I thought at first he was sensitive to my emotions but over the years he’s become more cold and doesn’t give a flying f if I’m upset about anything. Yesterday we were both sick… yet he spent the entire day sleeping in bed while I had to take my kids to school, karate, keep track of baby all day with food, bath changing etc I just feel defeated that on a day we’re both sick(and I’m pregnant) he doesn’t once ask about me.  He’s also been taking adderall and that’s dramatically shifted his moods. 

I’m so lost. I just want my man to be my protector and side with me when I’m feeling picked on by people. Rather, he debates me on my issues- “when you ask for a hug 🫂 but instead receive a lecture” is the overall tone. I think it’s over. I just don’t want to start over. :(
Oh and yes I’m just so emotionally isolated since he never once has validated any experience I’ve had. I saw somewhere the other day that it is actually a form of emotional abuse if someone consistently invalidates your feelings + emotions… and honestly when I chose my husband as my person, if someone disrespected him I would be like revved up about it and quickly defend his character etc. I think my husband hates me and I’ve offered divorce a month before the pregnancy bc I sense  he didn’t like me anymore… but here’s the thing: I no longer like him or have much hope to grow with him if he’s my main bully that enables people to mistreat me.",1,1767877394.0,Divorce,5,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

You cant do anything outside for an extended period unless it's a bit warmer. You can lose your fingers, toes, nose, and/or ears to frost bite.

Now on to what I really hate about the winter. The snow. Fuck the snow. Yes it looks pretty and ot helps refill the rivers so i understand why its needed. With that out of the way it still sucks ass.  As soon as it melts it gives everything an ugly half ass look. Especially when it mixes with sand on the street used for traction. The streets turn to a brownish mushy mess. Then of course you have the ice. Car accident and slips and falls from the damn ice. 

The final thing that passes me off about winter. This might be a little out there but fuck it. All you ""I love the winter"" people annoy the shit out of me. You people claim to love the winter, then how come I dont see you bitches outside during and or after a snow? You motherfuckers should be frolicking in the damn streets since you love winter so fucking much but no. Your probably inside you cushy house or job with your fucking overpriced coffee you made some poor schlub deliver to you so you could stay warm and cozy.

By accident once though, I drank decaf regular filter coffee from a drip machine that was not horrible, so I figured that maybe it is not so bad after all.


Couple years go by and I feel like decaf coffee started trending slightly, I saw videos about the different processes for decaffeination itself and somehow I got the impression that there has been some improvements on the decaf industry front and they're now better at taking out the caffeine without sacrificing the quality of the coffee. 


Then I start having some slight arrhythmia issues, and while it didn't seem serious, I figured that I should maybe decrease my caffeine consumption, or maybe at least occasionally replace the regular espresso with decaf. I put my normal bean subscription on hold and try a few different decaf beans. And boy have I been disappointed. I've had a lot of different issues but here are a few:


1. The taste.

All of the ones I've tried have been significantly worse than all of the normal beans I've had with the espresso machine. In milk drinks they're drinkable but still nowhere near great. 

2. Dialing in.

It seems that they need to be ground extremely fine, which is fine I guess, but the window for successful cup seems to be much, much smaller. Very small adjustment can make it from running through in 15 seconds to chocking and going full 45 seconds. 

3. The texture. 

We all know that rich, thick, syrupy espresso that looks gorgeous, tastes amazing and feels great in the mouth. Well, forget about that with decaf. It is so watery and even visually unappealing that this alone makes you not want to drink it. 

4. The clean up. 

I can't imagine how bad it would be without using a puck screen, and I'm not going to try, however, I'm used to getting these super clean pucks that fall right off the basket with a single basket. Not with decaf though, it is a gooey mess, everytime.


My beans are freshly roasted and like I said, I've tried different ones from different roasteries, but should I still try some more in hopes for better decaf espresso? Is there something vital in the process that I'm missing vs regular beans? Is it just bad, or personal preference? Maybe it's just harder to find a good decaf bean?


Let me know if you've had good results with decaf espresso or if I'm on a wild goose chase here. ",2,1767876831.0,espresso,13,1.0,False

**Journal of Dr. Stephen Barry**

**November 2nd, 2025**



It's been an… eventful few years since I joined Ashurst State Penitentiary. 

Maybe too eventful. 

I'd like to say I'm fine but honestly I'm not sure… am I fine? Am I not? Honestly, I don’t know!

Liz says I should take up journaling. 

I wasn’t super into the idea at first, but when I mentioned it to Cora, she seemed pretty on board with it. So I guess I've finally caved and now I've started a fresh journal. Hopefully this will help. I'm not sure if it will but I'm open to giving it a shot.



\*\*\*



How do I even start this? Do I just talk about myself? Do I talk about my day? I don’t know. Maybe I should’ve started with an actual journal as opposed to vomiting my thoughts out onto a Google Doc. Fuck, maybe it *would* just be better to try ChatGPT? At least that thing talks back. It’s like talking to the stupidest person you’ve ever met, but it talks back.

No… I’m not that desperate.

Maybe I’ll just introduce myself? Sure. I’ll introduce myself. 

My name is Dr. Stephen Barry. 

I’m not actually a medical doctor. I’m a psychologist. I switched to that after deciding I didn’t want to follow my parents into Marine Biology for… well, there’s a reason, but I’m not gonna get into it here.

I still think I ended up mostly alright. After working with criminals for a bit, I ended up getting offered an… interesting, gig working for a private company. They called themselves the International Fae Relations Bureau… FRB for short.. I’d worked as a consultant for a while, helping their agents track down dangerous individuals who weren’t exactly human, and eventually I figured I’d try working for them full time to see how that panned out.

I took a job as a researcher and psychologist at Marcus A. Smith Correctional Facility in Arizona… or more accurately, I took a job at their facility housed beneath the Marcus A. Smith Correctional Facility in Arizona. 

On paper, the facility has a long formal name that I don’t really remember because nobody ever uses it. Most people just refer to it as the Ashurst State Penitentiary (you know, because Smith and Ashurst were the first two senators of Arizona) even though it’s not exactly a state penitentiary. We get prisoners from all over. It’s just more low key to call it Ashurst State Penitentiary since people don’t tend to ask a lot of questions about what we do there once they hear that name. 

Ashurst is… it’s complicated. Despite the many, many threats upon my life and near death experiences, I haven’t hated my time there. 

But I won’t pretend it’s been easy either…I mean, hell, I got attacked by a Class 5 Old Fae within my first month or so. I got used as part of a prison break by Kayla, a Siren extremist who went on to mass murder most of the FRB’s board of Directors. After that fiasco ended with Warden Parker taking a leave of absence, I ended up shooting the intermittent warden Rick Russman, in the head after he tried to turn the place into an execution camp, and had to get an exorcism so his ghost would stop trying to kill me.

Not to mention the multitude of things that have tried to maim me, eat me or banish me directly to Hell. 

All things considered, it hasn’t been that bad… and for the last year or so, it’s been pretty calm!

Warden Parker is back full time after that whole fiasco with the escape and the intermittent warden and together we’ve worked on some reforms to the way Ashurst works. Back when I joined up, it was more of a dumping ground for anything dangerous. A bottomless pit to house whatever entities the FRB didn’t want running around out there.

That kind of thinking was what got the FRB nearly wiped out. Parker knows that.

And so we’ve been trying to tidy things up. We’ve implemented a three tiered system for the various different offenders at Ashurst.

*Tier One* \- is just for the minor offenders. The ones who fucked up, but have a chance to do their time and eventually rejoin polite society… or at least, rejoin it as much as a Fae can. Most people don’t really know they exist. I’ve actually seen a lot of progress with some of these prisoners! Especially Juliette… she was a young Siren who’d been taken into custody for her involvement in the organization Kayla had started. She’d been the first to be released. Honestly, I was happy to see her go and as far as I’ve heard, she’s kept to her probation. So I’ve got to say, I’m happy with the way the program is working.   
*Tier Two* \- is for the more severe offenders. Entities that are too dangerous to be freed. Perhaps they *could* be rehabilitated, and we’ll certainly give them a chance. But if that fails… well, they’re either in for a very long stay, or slated for execution. It’s harsh, yes. But the reality is that some people are just too dangerous. I avoid signing off on executions where I can, but sometimes it can’t be avoided.

*Tier Three* is kinda the nightmare tier. Anything marked as a Tier Three entity is kept on a specialized sublevel, far below the rest of the facility. Any entity marked by the FRB as a Class 4 or 5 (Entities who could cause massive or even apocalyptic loss of life if left unchecked) usually go there. I’m talking Old Fae, Low Gods and anything of the Midnight Grove. The things you do *not* want to fuck with. Tier Three entities are beyond rehabilitation… and destroying them is either complicated, or basically a pipe dream. We’ve managed to put down a few of them, but it’s never easy. These things are hard to kill. 

All in all… I’d say I’m happy with the way things are going. Ashurst feels… livelier, these days. Parker seems a hell of a lot less stressed than she used to. Hell, this past year has been the quietest we’ve had up until recently.

Which I guess now brings me to recent events…



\*\*\*



Silas Barrett was a Tier One inmate… although odds are, he would’ve been pushed down to Tier 2 eventually.

Barrett was… troubled. He was a Karah, which aren’t that much different from ordinary humans. They’re former humans, changed by long term exposure to the Dryads, although most of them have left their service these days and now thrive in their own little communities, bound by familial ties, blood magic and ancestral worship. Barrett was something of a loner though. He’d been kicked out of his own community for his macabre interest in some of the darker applications of blood magic, and once untethered from them, promptly went full serial killer.

He’d taken 4 lives before the police had caught up with him. After his arrest, he was handed over to the FRB and sent to Ashurst to ensure he didn’t try anything funny. 

During my sessions with him, he’d expressed little remorse for his crimes. I’m not sure if he simply lacked empathy or if he truly believed that whatever batshit insane end goal he was trying to accomplish was worth murdering innocent people… but I suppose it hardly matters now.

Silas Barrett was dead. 

The Guards found him this morning, after hearing him screaming. When they came to investigate, he was laying on the floor in his cell. He’d smashed his head against his bedframe until his skull split.

Hell of a way to go.

If you’d just shown me the body, I would’ve told you that there was no way it was a suicide. For starters, Barrett was far from suicidal! Every time I’d spoken to him, he talked about escape.

   *“When I break out of here, I’ll finish my work with your blood, Barry,”* He told me, during our last session together.

In other words - he had goals. One of them was to murder me, but that still qualifies as a goal. Even without his drive, his death was just too violent. He looked like he’d been beaten to death!

But we had a witness. Someone in the cell across from him who’d seen the whole thing.

Cassie Rose is an… interesting case. Technically she doesn’t belong in Ashurst. She’s not a Fae. She’s just a regular human serial killer, not much different from many of the others I’ve seen in other prisons I’ve worked in. Apparently Cassie accidentally got herself involved in a larger organized crime ring of some sort. Bloodsports, cannibalism, real sick shit. She agreed to serve as a witness and informant in exchange for protection and that protection was Ashurst. Apparently one of the FRB’s associates in Toronto pulled some strings to have her sent here. Not that I mind. This may sound odd since she is a literal serial killer who’s displayed no remorse whatsoever for her crimes, but I do legitimately like Cassie. And no, it’s not because she was some kind of e-girl on the outside… she’s really not my type. But she *is* charismatic. Infectiously so, honestly. Usually whenever I see her, she’s got a big, almost innocent grin plastered across her face (which sounds a lot creepier than it is when I write it down, considering her history.)

Although when I saw her today… Cassie wasn’t smiling.

When I saw her today, Cassie looked uneasy. Usually whenever we were in the interview room together she was calm… jovial, almost. 

Today though? Her arms were folded. She was bouncing her leg. She still smiled, but it seemed a bit forced. 

   “I was on my weekly call with my sister when the screaming started. I don’t know what the fuck came over him,” She said, when I asked her to tell me exactly what she saw. “One minute, he was in his cell brooding like the weird little creep he was and the next? He just… he just started screaming. Like, at the top of his lungs.”

   “Did he say anything?” I asked. “Was he trying to talk to anyone or was he just screaming?” I asked.

   “It was hard to make out. I think he might’ve been talking to someone? He kept begging for someone to leave him alone, even though he was the only one in the cell.”

She shook her head.

   “The whole thing was just… it was unsettling. Then he got violent. Started clawing at his face, banging his head against the metal part of his bedframe. I saw him do it. I heard the moment his skull cracked…”

She laughed. There was no humor in it, just a quiet unease, and considering the fact that even she wasn’t entirely sure as to how many people she’d murdered… well, that probably said something.

   “And that’s all you saw?” I asked.

   “That’s the whole enchilada,” she said. “You can call up Zoe and ask her what she heard, if you want. She heard the screaming start. I hung up when he started to get really agitated, but she’ll tell you more or less the same thing I did.”

   “No, that’s fine,” I said. “Thank you, Cassie.”



\*\*\*



I’ve seen the security footage from inside Barrett’s cell. There’s nothing there that contradicts Cassie’s story. Silas Barrett killed himself.

But… that doesn’t make any sense?

Why would he take his own life? Hell, why would he do it so violently?!

I don’t know.

I honestly don’t know.

I was hoping that maybe if I wrote all of this down, something would click. It really hasn’t. I’m not sure if this was a waste of time or not.

I dunno. Maybe I’ll read it back later and then maybe things might make a little more sense?

  


**Journal of Dr. Stephen Barry**

**November 3rd, 2025**



Dr. Samaras and I sat down with some of the other inmates in Section 2 today - the block where Barrett was held.

I wish I could say that it helped, but it really didn’t. 

We spoke to the inmates on either side of Barrett, just in case they saw or heard anything. The first of them, a Vampire by the name of Patrick Jackson who was more or less completely useless. 

   “I kinda slept through most of it,” He admitted a little sheepishly. “I mean like, I heard the screams! I just sorta… tuned them out.”

   “Tuned them out?” Cora asked. I noticed her hair twitching a little bit in agitation.

Dr. Cora Samaras is a Gorgon… and Gorgons aren’t exactly good at hiding when they’re pissed off. The serpents that make up their hair tend to say what their mouths don’t, and Cora’s hair was twisting and coiling, as if ready to strike. Usually, that’s a bad sign.

There’s a common misconception about Gorgon’s. It’s not their stare that kills you. It’s their bite. *That* is what you don’t want to mess with. Within a few minutes of being bitten, the flesh begins to calcify. I’ve seen it happen. It’s a nasty way to die.

   “You heard someone screaming and crying and you just… ignored it?” 

   “I mean… I didn’t really know the guy? Wasn’t he crazy or something?” Jackson asked. “I just figured the crazy guy was… y’know, being crazy?”

Cora’s mouth twitched a little, and she quietly ended the interview.

Next up was Barrett’s other neighbor. Some Mau by the name of Austin Molluso. 

Mau are fickle creatures. They’re Chimera-Fae, a subgroup of Fae who have animalistic traits. For Mau, their features are more catlike. They have catlike ears and tails, and just about every Mau worth their salt  can cast very realistic illusions which to my knowledge is not an ability most cats have.

Naturally, you'd assume Austin Molluso - and by extension, most Mau in Ashurst would be incarcerated for illusion related crimes.

But no. 

Molluso was in for fraud. 7 out of 10 Mau at Ashurst are in for white collar crimes. Embezzlement, fraud, market manipulation… just the most mundane shit. It's been a serious topic of discussion on if they even belong in Ashurst… but those illusions they cast makes keeping them anywhere else tricky. The Mau in Ashurst are fitted with runed collars to keep them from using their illusions. Without access to those, they normally just behave like regular prisoners.

   “Sorry, I wish I could say I saw anything, but I didn’t. I heard the screams, but from my vantage point…” He shrugged. His voice was quiet, apologetic. “Sorry,” He said again.

After Molluso, we brought in Jackie Meyers, who was one of Cassie’s neighbors. Her cell was across from Patricks.

Meyers was another weird case. She was a werewolf… although the crime she’d been brought in for had almost nothing to do with actually being a werewolf.

She’d used her werewolf form to rob banks… usually breaking in after hours, which would’ve admittedly been enough to get her in Ashurst anyways, but that wasn’t the thing that had actually led to her incarceration.

No, she was caught after a hit and run. She’d struck a pedestrian as she was leaving the scene of a robbery. 

Her story was more or less the same as Cassie’s. 

   “He was pacing, screaming… it was just him in there, though,” She said. “I didn’t smell anyone weird around.”

   “Would you have smelled anything unusual?” Cora asked.

Jackie raised an eyebrow at her.

   “I’ve got a good nose, okay?” She said. “I can tell when they clean the cells, which cell gets cleaned, who’s sick. Everything. So when I tell you nothing was out of the ordinary, I mean it.”

That was good enough, I supposed.

We skipped Cassie, since she’d already told us everything she knew… and that just left one last inmate who could’ve seen something.

Atticus Black.

Black was… weird. Like Cassie, he was fully human. Unlike Cassie, he wasn’t in Ashurst because someone was trying to keep him alive.

Atticus Black was brought in from California after being linked to several ritual murders. He and his followers had all been part of some sort of cult, worshipping one of the nastier High Gods. A being known as The Lugal. 

He’d spent some time in a regular prison… but it hadn’t held him.

Black knew how to handle magic… and it served him well.

Apparently, he’d used his own blood to open a portal to the Abyss - which is literally Hell - within his cell. Then he just slipped through and reappeared elsewhere. How the Devil herself didn’t clock him as something to keep is beyond me, but Black was recaptured six months later after taking another three lives. 

This time, the FRB got involved and sent him to Ashurst where we’ve got the protections to actually ensure he stays in his cell.

Black is another inmate shortlisted to be marked as a Tier 2, and the word ‘termination’ has been tossed around his file a few times, but honestly… he’s kinda a model prisoner.

During our one on one sessions, I’ve always found him articulate and downright pleasant to talk to… he’s a lot like Cassie in that regard, although despite being neighbors, I’ve never noticed the two of them interacting. 

While Cora and I interviewed him, Black sat comfortably in his chair. His black hair was neatly trimmed and combed, and even in his prisoners jumpsuit he looked relaxed and put together. 

   “Honestly, I regret to inform you that there really isn’t much I can add to your investigation,” He said. “If you want my honest opinion, I think Barrett was just disturbed. I’ve seen his kind before… well, I am his kind. A man on a mission. Confinement can be harsh… the realization that your work may yet be incomplete. It’s a harsh one.”

   “You seem to manage just fine,” I said. 

   “I have my good days and my bad days,” Black replied. “I suspect Barrett simply had a very bad day. All the same, there’s nothing I can tell you that Miss Rose or Miss Meyers wouldn’t have. Did I see the whole thing? Yes. Was it disturbing? Yes? Was it a bit much? Also yes. But I honestly can’t say I’m that surprised. Barrett was… well, he was a lunatic.”

Cora shifted in her seat.

   “You’re not surprised?” She asked. 

   “You two have spoken to him, haven’t you? Are you honestly going to look me in the eye and tell me that man, Karah, whatever he was, was playing with a full deck of cards? I don’t think so.”

He wasn’t wrong… but that answer didn’t sit well with me. He seemed too calm. Like he was downplaying it too much.

Cora seems to believe the same.

But going over all our notes, I hate to say that we’ve really got nothing more than a gut feeling.

To be honest, I’m not entirely sure I can say with confidence that Barrett didn’t just experience a psychotic break of some sort. He wouldn’t be the first… 

I don’t know.

I just… I really don’t know.

We had another incident today.

It was Jackie Meyers this time. 

She’s not dead, thank God… but she came damn near close. Cora was in the cell block when it happened. She’d been doing a regularly scheduled one on one with Jackson and was just bringing him back when it happened.

   “She was already screaming when I walked onto the cell block…” Cora said softly. She was sitting in her office when I went to check on her, a coffee in her hand. The snakes in her hair were slow, sluggish, drooping. Her eyes had a faraway look in them.

   “She kept saying that she: *‘Didn’t mean it’* and that she *‘Wasn’t a killer.’*

Then she started changing. Shifting into her wolf form. She started thrashing around her cell. I called for security to sedate her. She was clawing at the walls… howling… but it… that wasn’t rage, Steve. I’ve worked with enough werewolves to know the difference. It wasn’t rage. *She was fucking terrified.* The started clawing at herself… just… frantically clawing at herself. By the time security got to her, she’d almost fucking eviscerated herself… I… I’ve never… I’ve never seen a werewolf do anything like that before.”

I pulled her into a hug, and Cora rested her head on my shoulder.

   “It’s alright,” I said softly. “It’s alright…”

   “Is it?” Cora snapped, her serpentine hair flaring. She paused, realizing what that looked like and pulled away.

   “I’m sorry!” She said, “I’m sorry, Steve… I didn’t…”

   “It’s fine…” I took her by the hands. “Look, if it weren’t for you, Jackie would be dead by now.”

   “She might be dead either way,” Cora scoffed.

   “We don’t know that for sure. But she’s got a chance to pull through. That’s on you.”

She sighed but didn’t reply and when I pulled her into my arms again, she didn’t resist. 

She took the rest of the day off, after that.



\*\*\*



At time of writing, Jackie is still in intensive care. I’m not sure if she’ll pull through or not.

I hope so… for Cora’s sake. 

I’ve reviewed the footage of the incident. Just like before, I don’t see any real cause for what happened… Jackie just… she just lost her shit. One minute, she was laying in her bed… then suddenly something seemed to startle her.

Someone… although whoever or whatever it was isn’t showing up on camera. Then the screaming starts. Panicked babbling while she stares at nothing.

   *“I didn’t mean it! I’m sorry… I’m sorry I… I didn’t mean to… I’m not a murderer, I swear! I’m sorry!”* 

The way she was talking… it got me thinking about the hit and run she was involved with. Almost as if she were talking to her victim. I know from experience that ghosts are real, so there’s the possibility that could be it, but I’m really not sure. 

I’ve spoken to the other inmates nearby, but honestly the conversations weren’t all that different from the ones we had the other day, so I won’t go into them.

It just doesn’t make any sense.

I’ll have to keep digging.

It’s getting worse.

Something happened to Cora today.

She sent me a text sometime around noon, asking if I could stop by her office. 



*‘Hey, I’ve been thinking about what happened the other day with Jackie. I think I’ve got an idea on what might be going on, but I could use a second pair of eyes. I want to be sure before I go to Parker.’*



I was in a session with an inmate when she sent it, so I didn’t check it until after we were done. The moment I read it though, I made time for her and headed straight for the office.

I was down the hall when I heard the screaming.

I broke into a run, sprinting down towards her office. The door was closed, so I threw it open. As soon as I entered the room, I saw Cora. She’d crawled into the corner, the snakes in her hair were flared and hissing, trying to strike at something that wasn’t there.

   *“NO!”* She cried. *“NO, NO, NO! GET BACK! DON’T TOUCH ME! D-DON’T TOUCH ME! NO, NO!”*

She flailed her arms as if trying to push something back. Her snakes snapped forward, biting at thin air.

Then she began to thrash, clawing at something I couldn’t see as if it were crawling on her. Her snakes went wild, and began biting at her. Sinking their fangs into her chin and shoulders.

My heart skipped a beat.

She was biting herself.

*She was going to kill herself.*

I’d been frozen in place when I’d come in, but on instinct I acted. I noticed her wastepaper basket under her desk and grabbed it. Thinking fast, I forced it over her head, keeping her snakes contained.

   *“Cora! Cora, listen to me! You’re hurting yourself! Cora, stop!”*

   *“IT’S ON ME…”* She sobbed. *“OH GOD, IT’S ON MY SKIN!”*

   “No it’s not. Look at me. Cora. Look. Look at me.”

She opened her eyes. She was hyperventilating, still sobbing. She stared at me. Her snakes writhed and trashed inside the wastepaper basket. 

I heard someone entering the office behind me. I didn’t even look to see who it was, but I was pretty sure they were wearing a security uniform. It might’ve been Davis?

   “Get someone from medical in here now! She’s bitten herself!” I snapped.

They took off without another word.

   “I… Steve… I…”

Her voice was shaking. 

   “It’ll be okay,” I promised. ”It’ll be okay.

   “D-did I… did I really…?”

   “Yeah. I don’t know what Gorgon venom does to Gorgons but we’re gonna get you checked out, alright?”

   “Did I hurt you…? Did I…?”

   “I’m fine,” I promised her. “I’m fine. I’m more worried about you. Can you stand?”

She nodded, still shaking, still crying. She tried to speak, but couldn’t get a word out. I offered her a hand and helped her to her feet, then slowly I helped her to the medical wing, wastepaper basket still on her head.

I’d thought they’d be expecting us… but no. Whoever that security guard was, he’d clearly just fucked off. 

If I could remember who it was, I’d write them up. 



\*\*\*



Cora is fine for now. Gorgon’s aren’t immune to their own venom, but they do resist it and we have a decent antivenom on hand. She should be okay.

Right now she’s resting, and I’m going to stick around a little later tonight to keep an eye on her. I feel like I’m just sitting around though… and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just wasting time.

I don’t know. Cora’s computer is here. She’s sedated so many Maybe I can poke around her office. Maybe if I’m lucky, I’ll figure out what she was trying to show me before she wakes up.

  


**Journal of Dr. Stephen Barry**

**November 9th, 2025**



Of course.

Godfuckingdamnit.

*Of course.*

It’s just so fucking obvious. How the hell did I miss it? How the hell did any of us miss it?

Cora left the files she’d been looking at open on her computer. 

The first was the video footage of Jackie’s attack. Nothing I hadn’t seen before, but before, I’d only been looking at Jackie. I hadn’t been looking at anything in the background. I hadn’t been looking at the other inmates.

In the footage, Patrick and Cora could be seen in the hall, watching in horror as Jackie ripped herself open. They were easy to spot… but there was a second inmate I’d barely noticed.

From its vantage point along the wall of the cell, the camera could see into the hallway too. It could see Barrett’s empty cell across the hall… and it could just barely see into Molluso’s cell, right beside Barrett’s cell.

Molluso’s cell.

From that vantage point, you couldn’t see much. But you *could* see Molluso. His face almost pressed up against the glass, watching as Jackie ripped open her own flesh.

Maybe that was understandable given what was going on, but his expression seemed so calm. Matter of fact.

At one point, I saw Cora look in his direction. She hadn’t paid Molluso much mind, but she still had to have noticed him.

Maybe that’s what inspired her to start digging into him.

Austin Molluso. A 37 year old Mau. Arrested 3 years ago for a scheme where he’d approach people, using his illusions to pose as a loved one - usually a parent or grandparent - begging for money. He’d feed them a sob story about some trouble they’d gotten into, and naturally the poor victim would take pity and open their wallet. 

Not that abnormal for a Mau… until I remembered the way Jackie had reacted. Speaking as if she was begging the person she’d killed for forgiveness. 

She had to have seen them… or at least thought she did.

But then, how could Molluso cast any illusions at all? As mentioned before, we use runed collars to prevent that kind of magic from being used.

Cora had to have thought of that too.

I’ll admit, I probably shouldn’t have checked her emails. That was a breach of privacy. But I needed to follow the trail.

If there is any suspicion of a security failure, protocol is to immediately alert security. Cora would’ve emailed them the second she even thought something was off.

And that’s exactly what she did.

One hour before she’d texted me, she’d asked them to examine Molluso’s cell and his collar.

The results were still pending… which is a bit suspicious, but I went ahead and had my own examination done, while Molluso was taken out for his daily exercise. Warden Parker signed off on allowing me to personally go through his cell and my results were waiting for him in his cell when he got back. An entire folder. 

At my request, Molluso was the first one brought back from the indoor exercise yard today. I was waiting just outside of his cell as he was brought in… and I saw his eyes immediately shift to the folder on his bed. He paused, before looking at me and gingerly picking up the folder.

   “What’s this?” He asked.

   “You don’t recognize it?” I replied. “Go on. Take a look.”

He didn’t open the folder. He just kept staring at me.

   “I’ll admit, jumping from fraud to murder is a hell of a leap, otherwise we probably would’ve clocked you sooner.” I said. “And I wouldn’t expect you to have the things you’ve got in that folder there… details on Barrett’s victims, Jackie's hit and run and Cassie's admittedly very impressive library of snuff films. And of course, how could I forget a picture of Dr. Samaras office. How’d you come across those?”

Molluso didn’t respond.

   “Someone gave them to you,” I said. “I'm willing to bet someone messed with the runes on your collar too, didn't they? Made it inert. Give me a name and I won’t mark you down for termination.”

A small, knowing smile cracked Molluso’s lips.

   “You first,” He said softly.

I felt a hand on my shoulder and heard an all too familiar voice in my ear.

   *“You’re the one who ought to be terminated, Barry…”*

Russman.

I felt my skin crawl as he forced me to turn around. His eyes burned into mine. I could see the bullet hole in his head from where I’d shot him.

   *“You thought you could get rid of me?”* He hissed. *“Sorry, bud. You’re stuck with me for life… or however much life you’ve got left.”*

I didn’t respond to him, even as I felt his hand close around my throat.

   *“Time for your dirt nap, Barry…”* Russman growled. I saw something crawling out from underneath his skin. Small, biting insects, like ants or spiders, burrowing out of his flesh and crawling towards me. I could feel as their mandibles began to chew into my meat, burrowing down beneath my skin.

It was agonizing.

I couldn’t help but swat at them on instinct and it took a hell of a lot of restraint to keep myself still.

But I forced myself to look over at Molluso.

He glared at me, a smirk on his lips that slowly began to fade when he saw I wasn’t reacting. Not the way the others did.

   “Okay, full credit where it’s due. All of this really is pretty unsettling,” I said. “I didn’t know Mau could cause physical sensations like that… that’s very impressive. But the whole thing still loses its impact when you know it’s not real.”

The illusion of Russman tightened its grip on my throat. 

   *“Oh but I AM real!”* He snarled. The bugs wormed their way out of his flesh, and continued to burrow into mine. *“And you’ll be a fine sacrifice for Midnight's Rise…”*  
I gritted my teeth, ignoring the pain… which upon examination, was fainter than it probably should have been, and glared back at Molluso. I took a step away, pulling out of the phantom Russman’s grasp with no effort. 

   “Midnight’s Rise, huh? What’s that?”

I saw a flicker of unease in Molluso’s eyes. The phantom Russman lunged at me again, but Molluso’s focus was fractured. He wasn’t concentrating on making it feel real anymore and I already knew it wasn’t. I felt it grab me, but the pain was fading.

   “Midnight will Rise again…” He said. “Midight will Rise and one way or another, you’ll die. You’ll all die!”

   “Good to know. Warden Parker… have you seen enough?”

   “Yeah. Yeah, I’d say so…” Parker said from Barrett’s empty cell beside us. Molluso froze as she stepped into his field of view. She calmly took out her pistol, opened Molluso’s cell door and stepped in to face him.

The Mau froze up, eyes wide and bulging. He didn’t even get a chance to speak before Parker had pistol whipped him, sending him to the ground in a sad, anticlimactic heap.

His illusion dissipated, and now that I could finally stop putting on the tough facade, I allowed myself to thrash and swat at the phantom bugs I still swore I felt crawling all over my body.

   *“Fuck, fuck, FUCK…* God, that’s just…”

   “I could see you straining a little bit there,” Parker said as she holstered her pistol.

   *“Jesus Christ, that was the worst!”*

   “Yeah? Well you toughed it the fuck out. Attaboy, Barry.”

I shuddered. I needed the hottest possible shower and I needed it immediately. 

   “I’ll be moving this sumbitch down to Tier 2… solitary,” Parker said, nudging Molluso with her boot. “We’ll get this little shit to talk one way or the other.”

   “Good…” I said, pulling my arms in a little closer around myself. “Someone was helping him. Someone on the security team, most likely.”

   “Just what we fucking need…” Parker sighed. “Welp. Same shit, different day. I suppose you’ll be looking into this ‘Midnight Rise situation?”

I nodded.

   “Yeah. I’ll see what I can dig up.”

With that, I left Parker to her work.

Honestly, if anyone would break Molluso, it’ll be her… I’d say I pitied the little shit, but I really don’t. 



\*\*\*



Cora’s awake now. The doctor says she’ll be fine and she’s been sent home. I’ll check in on her shortly and let her know what’s happened. I’m sure she’ll be happy to hear that Molluso’s been dealt with… although I can’t shake the feeling that Molluso is just the tip of the iceberg.

Hopefully he’ll talk and make things easy. But if he doesn’t?

I’ve got a feeling our troubles are far from over.

Just flew into town and boy are my arms tired... along with the rest of my body because that's a long ass plane ride. Even worse when you sleep about 90 minutes in 19 hours of flying.... But on the positive side, all my flights had free wifi, so I went ham on TF.  
  
It's currently 7ish pm and I'm finishing writing this while sitting in the giant hot tub in the middle of my room (I'm aware that many people think it's a waste, but fuck em, i did it for me). Big shout out to the Hotel Baraquda staff. So far all the locals I've met have been awesome, but the staff at this hotel are so cool. I've never had anyone from a hotel call 5 minutes after I got into my hotel room to make sure everything was alright. They also sent up some goodies to welcome me, unfortunately it was during my first shit since I set out on this quest 2 days ago... needless to say, they had to wait a minute. Also, great call on Nam's. I know it's more expensive, but after sitting for essentially a day and a half, I needed the expedited trip. The airline also fucked up and caused my bag (that I didn't want to check) to come in on three next flight, 90 minutes later. But Noina was a trooper and waited for me. Seriously, if you get her, treat her well because she's wonderful.  
  
So far the highlight of TF was the girl who immediately wanted to go off app, asked which sexy outfits she should bring, and told me she would ""suck my soul out"" after I told her bbbj was my favorite. I suspect she's new to the game because she's fairly attractive but quoted me 3k apples LT + transit (600 each way from a place called Chanthaburi). Asked what was on the table and she said ""all my holes"". Unless one of the vets spots a serious red flag, I'm gonna go for that one. Note: this paragraph was written while I was on the plane and I have not heard from her since lol. And the girl I selected to be my first from TF also flaked, or she's at least a few hours late. But yall warned me, so I was prepared for it.  
  
Ended up thinking it would be a good decision to look for a legit massage to help me unwind from the flights. Instead found several special ones. Checked out a few ""ladies"" with nice bodies, but moved on when I realized they had bigger Adam's apples than mine. Picked a super sweet tiny girl named Ann, or whatever the Thai version of Ann is. I expected a half ass massage and unenthusiastic BJ, but she was really good at the massage. We joked around and she teased me when I jumped... but she got a little too close to the brown eye for comfort. Ended with a nice bj, nothing mind blowing, but it worked. Then I felt bad because I apparently had more in the chamber than I realized...  
  
So yea, I'm still cleaning off the massage oil and welding what to do next. Thinking about taking a quick nap so I can jump right into the crazy late night shit tonight. Fuck it, you only get your first Pattaya experience once, right?  
  
Also if anyone can give me a run down on weed bars, that would be awesome. I went in one and it seemed more like a coffee shop that sold bongs and rolling papers.

1q7arh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Uzbekistan/comments/1q7arh0/considering_moving_from_bangkok_to_tashkent/,Considering moving from Bangkok to Tashkent,"I’m currently in process of selling my condo in Bangkok that will take approximately one month so by the end of January/ early Feb I’ll be able to move. I’ll have about 700,000 USD from that sale that I intend to convert into a property in another country (maybe not immediately).

I’ve been always romanticising the Central Asian region because of how isolated it is geographically and the mystery that surrounds that place. The nature the clan food and fresh air.

I’ve only been to Kazakhstan twice and seen Astana and Almaty of which I definitely prefer Astana because of how walkable, clean it is and everything is new, love the architecture there.

However Kazakhstan doesn’t allow foreigners to buy any property unless you are a resident there. Uzbekistan afaik on the other hand allows me to buy an apartment even if I’m just visiting as a tourist (my EU passport can enter for 30 days visa free and I’m sure after that I can get another type of visa easy). I also don’t really stay in one place longer than 1-2 months at a time even if the place is my base and I have my own property there.

I did some research about new buildings in Tashkent and found that there is a new tower a first skyscraper in the country called Nest One where apartments are priced slightly over $3000 per square meter which means I could get a place 3 times bigger than the one I had in Bangkok. Although I probably wouldn’t be going for 300 sqm but rather 150 sqm max.

Tashkent seems like a very big vibrant city and on paper looks bigger than Astana so I’d like to know how’s the experience living there if I choose it as my main base there and will spend 30-40% time a year there.

I might consider first just renting short-mid term if I can find any penthouse style places.

As a side fun business I want to open a small boutique longevity/weight loss/bio hacking clinic combined with a small max 10 people Pilates studio possibly a matcha coffee shop too with some basic metabolically healthy and gut friendly locally sourced food. Would consist of targeted peptide therapies, hormone replacement, HBOT, red light, sauna, IHHT.

1q7aq6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExEgyptDating/comments/1q7aq6w/21m_looking_for_longterm_relationshipfriendship/,21M looking for longterm relationship/friendship,"Hellos everyone,

I am looking for people who are serious about forming meaningful connections, whether longterm relationship or just genuine friendship.

A bit about me: I value honesty, maturity, intelligence, personal autonomy, and respect. I am more introverted but I feel comfortable with meeting and talking to new people. I enjoy gaming (just finished No, I'm Not a Human), reading (currently reading The Second Sex), traveling (in Egypt for the mean time cause I do not have the finances to fund anything abroad), philosophical and political conversations, music (huge SOAD fan), anime (currently watching Haibane Renmei), movies/shows (recently finished Severance, totally recommended).

People usually call me a libtard, but I prefer to view myself as a centrist in the sense that I do not pick extreme views and do not fully identify with the liberal left on many issues. My life philosophy is centered around living with such uncompromising freedom and integrity that simply existing according to my principles becomes itself an act of rebellion against the uncaring world we live in (heavily inspired by Albert Camus' work The Myth of Sisyphus).

I identify as an agnostic, yet I am still interested in the spiritual aspects of religion. I do practice religious rituals for both personal and societal reasons, mainly from the Islamic tradition due to my background, and I am open to practicing other religions Christianity, Buddhism, or any elaborate theological structure. I plan to study Islam and Christianity more in the future since I am interested in how they shaped modern civilization. To elaborate, I do not believe that religions are inherently bad or harmful, even though some aspects could certainly be.

Moreover, I do not like drinking alcohol. I smoke socially, but neither a heavy smoker nor do I smoke alone. I care about my health quite a bit so I am not a big fan of such habits.

For the friendship side: I value friends who can have deep conversations but also enjoy simple, low-pressure moments like gaming together, watching shows, or just talking about life. I appreciate people who are independent yet capable of mutual support, who challenge my thinking but respect boundaries, and who can laugh at themselves and the absurdities of life.

I tend to connect best with those who are introspective, thoughtful, and value loyalty over quantity in friendships. Shared interests are a great starting points, but I am very open to meeting people whose passions are completely different. I prefer keeping things meaningful rather than casual acquaintances, so I am not here for surface-level interactions or small talk. I enjoy building a sense of trust and understanding over time.

For the time being, I am (almost) completely off the grid. I do not open insta, fb, whatsapp, or reddit much. Maybe now and then (and obviously now), but for the most part you will reach me through my phone number and email. I am not a huge calling person per se, but I will call you frequently and (hopefully) you will call back as frequently. I live in Cairo (not originally from here), but do not mind traveling a couple of hours to hang out on weekends. If you are living further in Upper Egypt, it would prove difficult but we could still meet every couple of months.

For the romantic relationships side: I am pan-, demi-, and sapiosexual. You could say I am interested in all gender identities (cis, trans, nonbinary). I come from an Islamic background if that could be an issue for you, but I personally do not mind dating someone from a Christian background. My friends believe that I am a hopeless romantic lover boy, but I will let you decide if that is true or not. That said, I would like to take things slow at first rather than rushing everything. A slight age gap is acceptable i.e. ±3 years, age is just a number after all.

I date to marry, but I do not believe in marriage in the legal sense but as a spiritual and social ceremony. Marriage as a tool was invented to solve a very outdated issue. Nevertheless, I think the idea of symbolizing forever commitment and celebrating such symbol with friends and family is such a lovely thing.

I plan to travel abroad after graduation to either work or pursue a master's degree, and do not generally plan to get back to Egypt. I do not hate the place here per se, but it is just unsuitable for my future goals. I do have a lot of stuff that I want to accomplish in my lifetime and would not like to waste much time in general.

I do want kids eventually, not in the near future, but at some time later when I and my partner are capable both financially and physically. Of course the kids do not need to be biological necessarily. I simply love kids and would like to raise a one myself alongside my partner.

Thanks for reading all of that. I should admittedly contract it down, but these exact words were the truest to my character. If any of this relates to your soul, I would love to meet up for a coffee, a walk downtown, or a museum visit.",3,1767875933.0,ExEgyptDating,0,1.0,False

Let’s face it… when you have an unexplained problem over and over again, most doctors tend to roll their eyes and shove an unrelated Rx in your face and go about their day. 

For reference, I am a female in my mid 30’s, and I have a history of cystic acne, even having taken accutane once before about 10 years ago, which worked well for a little while, with the occasional bad breakout, but recently, in the past 4 months or so, my face broke out BAD. Worse than it ever has before. It was so painful and my self esteem was at an all time low, on top of already trying to navigate a “new” mid 30 year old ever changing body. I have endometriosis and have been unable to conceive since I started trying about 6 years ago, so I have even done many rounds of ovulation inducing meds, and didn’t have this kind of reaction with acne. Nonetheless, I have chalked acne up to being hormonal and due to endometriosis for a long time. I have tried most oral meds and most topical meds in relation to acne with no relief. After such a stint with acne this time, I decided to give birth control pills another try, something I absolutely hate and haven’t done in probably 12+ years, and am trying spironolactone again. Currently 3 weeks in. Also, to try to make the picture more clear, I had my gallbladder removed about 10 years ago, so know that may play a role in what I will say next when it comes to high contents of fat at once. Also, I am a registered nurse, so I do have some basic knowledge at least of how most medical processes, gathering and tracking relevant information and such work. 

I’ve noticed this before but didn’t put too much thought into it… but yesterday in particular was bad. Yesterday, I decided to stop and get a blizzard from Dairy Queen. I knew it was a mistake and that it would probably mess my stomach up but it was way worse than I anticipated. I had to go to the bathroom almost immediately and went several times for the rest of the night. I had intense stomach cramps and felt sooo tired afterwards for the rest of the evening. Like, just drained. I actually thought before that my acne may be related to dairy so I cut out coffee creamer that contained dairy and switched to oat milk. I didn’t really notice a difference with my face, but maybe my gut felt a little better after, say, a cup of coffee. Today is the morning after that blizzard and my stomach still feels a little crampy and not 100% like I need to watch what I eat today. I used to loveee milk. Preferred it actually over a lot of things. But I did see that lactose intolerance can develop later in life.

I know that IBS and lactose intolerance can overlap. My mom and brother both have IBS so I am somewhat familiar. 

I don’t really know what I’m looking for here, and I know what the answer would be… to cut it out and see if it makes a difference and I am going to try that, but maybe I just need someone who has similar experiences to listen and validate me. 

Did anyone have acne issues like this before cutting dairy out? Also, what’s the general census about lactase pills? The best bang I see for the buck is some from Costco with pretty good reviews. 

I’d love to hear about your experiences with determining you may be lactose intolerant later in life and with acne and lactase specifically. And how do you navigate in the world as someone with lactose intolerance. ",2,1767875785.0,lactoseintolerant,0,1.0,False

I was never married before, me 25F and my husband 31M are married for 5 months. It’s been hard since we are different in few aspects. For example - spending time alone or together. He feels like since I moved with him we’re spending all the time together. He’s at work, then he comes home, watches TV. For him it is time together. It took me so much explaining that it’s not quality time. So we made a compromise and we made a weekly schedule when we go out together, etc and most of the time I put there time alone for him because I know he desperately need it. He goes to gym, to play football, to meet friends and I’m saying nothing to this, I’m even happy he can rest like that. Yesterday he said we will watch a movie but he needs to go to the city for half and hour. He was gone for 1,5 hour. I called him and he didn’t pick up. He picked up after his brother called him. I was angry. I said “When you don’t want to watch a movie with me just tell me or you don’t have to propose time together at all if you don’t mean it really”. I don’t know what’s wrong with him. At the begging he was treating me with respect but now… when I ask if we have plans for the weekend I hear “we can go for a coffee, pick the place”. When I ask which place he says he doesn’t know, he has no plans. He says this to me while looking at the phone. When we go out he’s all the time looking at the phone. But when his friends want to meet with him he’s searching for a place, planning and he’s mad when I text him during the meeting. 

Is this too much what I ask for? A compromise - few hours during the week of time with me, to know if he wants to cancel the plans (not disappearing) and not treating me worse than his friends? ",8,1767875657.0,MuslimMarriage,2,1.0,False

For the last three years, I’ve kept the same quiet tradition: I buy my favorite coffee, a small cake from Starbucks, walk around parks or museums, and buy myself flowers. I was happy and content but it came to the point where it feels lonely na. 

I appreciate the greetings though. However, I’ve never really experienced being surprised, kasi I’m usually the giver. I guess I just wish maybe someday someone would give me, even a single stem of flower on my birthday too. Even a friend. Just once.

I’m turning 24 soon, and I’ll probably celebrate the same way again. I’m independent, and I can go on days being alone. But birthdays… birthdays still sting a little.

This ain't about self pity or whatever. Just needed to get if off my chest. 

I just hope that one day, my future birthdays will feel different.  ",4,1767875596.0,OffMyChestPH,3,0.84,False
1q7am7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightmares/comments/1q7am7t/hiding_via_acting_normal/,Hiding via acting normal,"Now before i actually get into the nightmare itself i will mention, i dont usually get nightmares, and i assume the main reason for it is because i drank coffee before bed as a way of falling asleep faster (i know its stupid but it works everytime for me)

When it initiated, i was in some house reassembling that of a standard house out in the country or by a farm, but it wasnt near a farm, in fact i dont know where it was, it was too dark to see outside (this had been standard in my dreams so i didnt bat an eye) wandering i noticed a few of my own friends were also wandering, the inside of the place reassembled that of an unfinished basement, set up in a way to hold people, it had the same vibe as the large christmas store in frankenmuth MI, but if i was there after hours.
 Eventually after wandering for a bit, i found a staircase, which had at the top, a door that lead to a strange party room, everyone in this room had a cup in their hand, and reassembled a funeral homes foyer, blue lights flooded the room with streaks of green and pink moving around the room, the dancefloor was full but nobody was dancing, everyone was holding solo cups and socializing. But their was one thing that caught my gaze, a thing that had to be at least 8 feet tall, twiggish limbs and a face with sunken eyes and a full mouth to toe jaw stretch. im confident that that was not a normal human, i left my phone in that room and forgot about it.  
I moved back downstairs hearing one of my friend mention a thing about a device with 3D printed wires, i thought ""well at least we have something to do"" and began investigating, and yeah, it was just a 3D printed box with 3D printed wires coming out leading to the nearby power box, investigating further revealed more of these devices scattered, we began ripping the wires out the boxes when eventually a friends phone popped up with a serious warning, releasing a noise that sounded like the equivilent of sidechaining a tornado siren. Their screen was black with a countdown from 100 seconds with the message in white typewriter font saying ""preted your using or opening something, i you will die if you do not. It is here.""
I panicked and grabbed a small toy mailbox pretending to have full interest while the sound of rising strings began to come out of the walls, one of my friends hid in a murky fish tank, planning to dip and hide until it was gone and another hid behind a pillar under a staircase near the door. Eventually, panic got the better of me, and in complete blindness to my actions, i had punched through the fishtank, and through the heart of my friend, the last thing heard from them was a blood curdling scream as their face began to look like it had been rotting for years, their corpse was moved out of the fish tank and onto a chair, while another friend was panicking over the dead friend as strings got even louder eventually calminating in a friend screaming ""oh my god!!"" Before all i saw was white and my bedroom, i woke up feeling so cold it felt like i had fallen asleep without a blanket.

If eating were the only purpose, ordering online would always be the easier option. What truly attracts people to cafes is the overall experience, the comfort, the ambiance, and the feeling of being in a space that feels inviting and enjoyable.

# Trending Cafe Interior Design Ideas That Customers Love

  
These trending cafe interior design ideas by J Design Studio are popular because they make people feel comfortable, relaxed, and excited to spend time in the space. Let’s explore what’s working right now.

# 1. Biophilic Design

  
Biophilic design is all about bringing nature indoors. Think lots of plants, wooden furniture, stone textures, and natural light. It creates a calm and relaxing vibe that makes customers want to stay longer. People love sitting in green spaces; it feels refreshing and Instagram-worthy at the same time.

# 2. Vintage & Retro Style

Vintage and retro elements are back in style. Old-school tiles, retro chairs, vintage posters, and classic décor combined with modern touches make a cafe feel unique and memorable. This style gives a cozy, nostalgic feeling that attracts both young people and adults looking for a warm, inviting space.

# 3. Instagram-Friendly Spaces

Cafes today are designed for photos and social media shares. Neon signs, statement walls, colorful corners, and creative seating arrangements make every shot look great. If a cafe is Instagram-worthy, customers will naturally share it online, giving your cafe free publicity.

# 4. Open Coffee Bar

An open coffee bar is a trend that works wonders. Customers love watching coffee being made, from espresso shots to latte art. It adds energy, trust, and interaction to the space.

They're a natural, chemical-free way to exfoliate and nourish the skin. But, like any skincare product, coffee scrubbers can be overused or misused, leading to irritation and other issues. In this article, we'll explore the benefits and risks of coffee scrubbers, and provide tips on how to use them safely and effectively.



What are Coffee Scrubbers?



Coffee scrubbers are a type of exfoliant made from coffee grounds, often mixed with other ingredients like oils and sugars. They're designed to remove dead skin cells, improve circulation, and nourish the skin. Coffee scrubbers can be used on the face, body, or both, and come in a variety of textures and formulations.



Benefits of Coffee Scrubbers



1. Exfoliates dead skin cells: Coffee grounds are a gentle yet effective exfoliant, removing dead skin cells and revealing smoother skin.

2. Improves circulation: Caffeine in coffee can help improve blood flow, reducing the appearance of cellulite and giving skin a healthier glow.

3. Antioxidant properties: Coffee contains antioxidants that can help protect skin from environmental stressors and reduce inflammation.

4. May reduce inflammation: Coffee's anti-inflammatory properties can help soothe skin and reduce redness.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Hey guys,

I'm a heavy sleeper. Like, 'sleeping through a construction site' heavy. I tried everything: Alarmy, putting my phone across the room, math alarms. Eventually, my brain just learned to solve math in my sleep.

So I spent my weekends building something worse.

It's called **Ducking Loud Alarm**.

Here is how it tortures you:

* **The Sound:** It’s a rhythmic, loud duck quack mixed with a siren. It’s not soothing. It induces pure rage.
* **The Lock:** You can't just swipe it off. You have to solve a **Picture Matching Game** (Pairs). It forces your brain to actually wake up and process visual information.
* **No Mercy:** It keeps the screen active and overrides silent mode.

I’ve been using it for a week. I hate it. But I haven't overslept once.

I just put it on the App Store for the price of a coffee ($1.99) because I need to fund my caffeine addiction (ironically). No subscriptions, no ads, just ducks.

If you struggle with waking up, give it a shot. And sorry in advance.

1q7adz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/deftones/comments/1q7adz4/saturday_night_wrist_album_review/,Saturday Night Wrist Album Review,"Saturday Night Wrist is Deftones' 5th Studio album, And it is released in October 31st, 2006. 
In my opinion, this album makes a really big difference from the other past albums.
The subtle but still noticeable shift from Heavier Songs like ""Lotion"", ""Root"" , and ""Headup"", to Softer songs like ""Cherry Waves"", ""Xerces"" etc, really makes fans wonder the genre of this band.
alright, enough taking, let's get straight into the album. 
For me, Saturday Night Wrist is a really Unique album and it's definitely one of my favorite deftones albums. 
From songs like ""Rats!Rats!Rats!"" to ""U,U,D,D,L,R,L,R,A,B,Select,Start"", you could see the contrast in this Amazing album.
Okay, track one, Hole in the Earth.
this song starts with a guitar harmonic part (and it's usually switched with a synth part if played live) and you get to the intro. The intro hits you right away with Abe's groovy drums that pairs perfectly with Chino and Steph's heavy power chords.
this section ends with a clean guitar that cuts through the air, Chi's signature playing, and still.. Abe's groovy beats. And then The vocals start, while Frank playing atmospheric synths. after that, Steph starts to play his really downtuned 7-String that acts as the cherry on top in this part. and now.. the chorus hits. you feel like flying around the solar system in this part. (well that's one way to explain it.) 
Fast forward to the post chorus, Chino hits a high note for ""I hate all of my friends"" which explains the hard time he had when producing this album. And the bridge, it's as good and legendary as the first half. Chino sings ""This is the end.. Please take a bow."" Explaining that Chino thinks that this is the end of the band. Fast forward again to the outro, it's.. the same as the intro? until Chino plays a different rhythm paired with some synths. No debate, that's one of the best deftones outros of all time. and then it ends. it ends with a d power chord. and you hear Steph's lead guitar, playing for one last time before we're out.
That's a really solid track from this album. Definitely one of the most Relatable, Atmospheric, and Best Tracks. 9/10. Alright, we're still in the beginning of the album and we're in Song 2! (Not the blur song, but the second track.) alright, rapture.. it's definitely.. questionable, wait let me listen to it one more time to make sure. okay, i just listened to it one more time, and it's not as bad as I thought it is. It's like a rougher and less dreamy Version of a song later in this album. It's definitely moody and stuff, but it's not one of my favorites. What more can I say, i could catch myself listening to this song. 5/10.
Song 3! Beware. Hey didn't this song get like a trap remix and stuff? Yeah something like that. This is a solid song, maybe not something I'd listen to like really usually. It's still really good though. This song tells us to ""Beware"" for the temptations of drugs, alcohol, and lust. and it is interpreted as "" the water "" in this song as told in the chorus ""Beware the water.."" this song has a solid structure too. Frank and Steph really did a good job on the synths in this song. I don't really like the ""beeeeeeeware"" high note in the chorus. it's just really overhyped and stuff. And oh comes the breakdown.. Steph 7-String G# Standard guitar layered with a distorted bass really rips through the air like a bullet. And that's all for this song! maybe you'd like the chirping sounds at the end.
8/10. 
And Song 4!! Cherry Waves. This song got a lot of popularity on TikTok these years and I'm proud about it! It's kind of overrated, but it's worth it like in the middle of the song. This song starts with a Abe's matching band type beat and continues with Chino's vocals and Chi's Groovy bass. The chorus is really ethereal for me. It reminds me of something really deep. Like the ocean! Yeah, that's the main idea for this song. in lines like ""If like you, should sink down, beneath"" you could see what I'm referring to. The bridge is good,  it's like a thorny riff (that's another way to explain this album) and then it ends with the chorus. The outro is nothing really special but it feels like realizing you put out the fire that warms you. it's like moving through the ruins of this song. and you're like escaping this song. (emphasized by the lyric ""escape below"" in this part) Another 9/10 for me.
Song 5!!! Mein. This song is really atmospheric in my opinion. This song features Serj Tankian from another Alternative metal band ""System Of A Down""
Abe's doing really good work in this  song. And I think the bridge (where Serj sings) is kinda overrated. What more can I say, it's really good, I can't lie, but I don't have much to say for this song. Thank you Serj, And that's another 9/10 for this album.
Song 6... U,U,D,D,L,R,L,R,A,B,Select,Start. 
This is a really Unique song. It's an instrumental song, that's just as good as the other songs. This song starts with a.. what's this sound? Well, I don't really know anyway. It's like plucking the strings above a guitar nut. And the part continues with.. well.. instruments.. yeah it's really good nonetheless. 8.5/10
Song 7!!! Xerces. 
Oh how much text can I type for this song, it's just so beautiful, just like the Xerxes butterfly, which is extinct. (The song probably gets its name from there) It starts with a simple section with a piano playing, which is sometimes a thing in deftones' songs.
Some people question the meaning of this song. I think it's about death. From the lyrics, maybe you could interpret it as death, or many other things! That's what I like about deftones and Chino's lyric writing. You could interpret it by any way. You could tweak it to match your or someone's story and stuff, and it'll probably make sense! That's why deftones has a good fanbase, because the fans heavily relate to the lyrics, even if they have different life stories! It's awesome! Yeah back to Xerces. 
Fast forward to the outro, Steph's guitar playing is using bends and stuff. That's what makes this part special, it's really nice. It's really ethereal, and it reminds me of a time in my life! Alright, my rating is.. 10/10!! The perfect song for me! Thank you deftones for writing this song, it's really really really good :)))
Alright, Alright, here's song 8, which is ""Rats!Rats!Rats!"". 
This is the song I was referring to in Rapture (the second track) 
and well it's a dreamier and less rough song than Rapture. It's really fire tho, 
This song starts with Steph's 7-String Downtuned to Drop F# making staccato chords, and then the rest of the band enters the song. After that part you have the really short pre-verse part. I think it is really cool because it has a pinch harmonic at the lowest string, which is the F#. (I don't know why's that cool.) Then Chino starts to sing: ""Decide! Decide! Is this it, is it? Decide"" Being screamed at you like you did a horrible mistake. After that section ends, it kinda ""rises you up high"" to the dreamy section. Fast forward to the breakdown, it's really cool. Steph is just chugging that guitar really fast that sound like the drums use double pedals (Idk if I did that right, I don't play the drums.) and Chi's just following that chug? Can you believe it? Using fingers? Chugging that fast? That's just incredible. And the chugging section follows a power chord part. Then its the verse until it ends. Heh, pretty cool song, 8/10.
Song 9... Oh how do I start this. 
Pink Cellphone is a deftones song that is heavily using the synth. It makes mixed opinions in the community. I personally, I kinda dislike that song. It's groovy BUT, the words at the end is just.. weird. Frank did a good job on that track but it's questionable. 
4.5/10.
Song 10. Combat.
What's this song again? Wait let me listen to it. Intro sounds like one more light by Linkin Park. ooh, it sounds like if you put every song in Saturday Night Wrist in one song. I think that this is the most forgettable song of the album. It's good though, there's not much for me so yeah. 7/10.
Alright, song 11, Kimdracula. 
Really good song, good intro, good structure, good instrumental, good vocals, it's just good. Fans theorize that this song is about Chino's divorce, and I agree with that theory. I think this song has the best lyrics in Saturday Night Wrist. ""I really wish these snakes were your arms."" That's just absolutely great. Oh yeah, the guitar in the intro is top 10 deftones riffs of all time. Abe's a beast in this song, indeed. And hey, we're reaching the end of this album. so, my rating is 9/10 for this song.
Song 12... Final song (or is it?) 
Riviére. This is a great song. It's that one soft song in every deftones album. If nostalgia has a sound, it has to be this song. Chino sings so good in this track. The guitar is really great, Frank's Synths are good, Abe's still a beast. The groove is just unbelievable.
And that one part is just.. great. And remember, it's great not perfect. I don't have a lot to say for this track so.. okay. 8/10.
Track 13? Ohh, it's Drive, the cars cover. This song is like a cherry on top for this album. It's like an ending to a horror film when everyone's dead and the main character just sipping coffee and covered in blankets. This song feels like dawn after a really bloody night. 9/10. THE END. 
Hey guys, so this is my first review and hope you guys enjoy it, sorry if some songs' review are too short or too long, so yeah I apologize. And this is all my opinion, you don't need to agree with me, and you guys don't need to be mad. I respect your opinion, have a great day.

1q7acno,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1q7acno/should_i_break_up_with_my_boyfriend/,Should I break up with my boyfriend?,"I (21f) am in a relationship with my boyfriend (22m) for 2,5 years. I'm thinking about breaking up, but it's really hard to decide. We always had love and understanding for each other, but there were always things that weren't perfect, about which we argued. I am really responsible, I like order, being reliable, being productive, overall active and proactive. Making positive change on myself and doing new things etc. He is a really good person, he is super calm and understanding, he is really smart, charismatic and overall I am proud to be with him. But he is not so responsible. He has a bad memory, he always forgets his promises, he forgets stories that i told him that are important to me, he always procrastinates on everything, even if the thing he said he'll do is his idea. He is living a slow life, always drinking his coffee in cafés for long hours. Never inviting me and making ides for fun dates, that aren't being in café or in his room. So when we traveled to different places, where we tried new and fun things, our relationship was so much better. I had higher libido, which regularly disappoints. He always has high libido and is always ready to make love, while i am not. I need a lot of foreplay and recently i realised that his passive and unresponsible behaviour made my libido go down. I took the responsibility to work on it and fix it, i read books, took a course, visited therapist. And he always said that we'll stay together as long as he sees me trying to fix the issue we have. If I give up and the issue is still there, the relationship will end.

He is the person who usually understands me so well, and he was ready to try to change the things that bothered me as they are objectively not so good for himself either, but recently i feel like he stopped trying. He doesn't want to work on that anymore. He even doesn't apologise when he brakes his word, he just says it's not his fault, his brain works that way. (e.g. He said he'll call me to chat (we haven't seen each other in few days) in 10 minutes, after he finishes a game, then 2 hours later he calls and asks me why didn't i remind him, tells me that he goes out now and can't talk. He got lost in his game, lost sense of time, and ultimately didn't call me for 2 hours. He didn't apologise because his brain simply works like that and it's not his fault. And for him it's too much effort to sat an alarm.) Thats one example, i have a ton of these. I can't accept this kind of behaviour, but I can't just let him go either. I love him and he loves me. We deeply care for one another. We discussed our future together, we wanted to get married one day and have kids. But now it all seems to be falling apart and i feel like I'm loosing part of myself and my future with loosing him. I feel like I'll never find love this deep and I don't want to be alone forever. Now we are in out hometowns for holidays, this Sunday we'll be back in the city where we study and we will talk about this. If he wants to break up too, it'll be easier. 

  
Tldr I don't know weather I should brake up with my boyfriend. We love each other and have a healthy relationship, but he is not responsible which is bothering me. ",1,1767874780.0,relationships,7,1.0,False
