Ngayon lang...it was so sad... it's him na nakilala ko, mga six months ago already. Recently lagi kami nagchachat, him doing the first move. Usually replying sa stories ko. He said he'll take me out on a coffee date pero malayo kasi sya naka-assign, at di pa rin yun natutuloy kasi busy kami both weekdays at may Saturday class din ako. That's one of the signs din na hindi nya talaga ako gusto kasi free sya ng weekends, pero di nya magawan ng paraan kahit i'm free on sundays. I'm kind of traditional kasi and i prefer guys who do the first move. I'm single and free naman so i explore possibilities. 

Buti nalang talaga he revealed (kahit implied) yung intentions nya sakin... he asked kung kailangan ko ng stress reliever. I said that syempre oo, but kahit walang jowa, i'm perfectly fine. Deep inside me naman if there's someone who'll knock on my heart, then we'll test if the heart beats...At first, i didn't know that he's talking about being partners in bed. Pero while reflecting on his words, narealize ko na yun pala ang gusto nya... It was just so sad... na yun lang ang gusto nya... and we're not on the same boat. 

I'm telling this here kasi nakakapagod na sobra lalo na trentahin na to. 😆 Yun lang... 

I wanted to say that it's my fault for assuming that we already had something... but I don't wanna gaslight myself. Wala akong mapagsabihan pa kasi wala pa naman nakakaalam in our circle na magkachat kami. Super sad ako hindi ako ganun nakapakinig sa statistics class ko kanina. Anyways...

While I’m here, another disc had a stain (sort of lumpy and looks like it could be taken off) on the label and can’t be read (I missed this before purchasing 😬). Is there a safe way to clean it off?

Before my symptoms start I get this kind of aura of pain in my lower abdomen and I know if I go pee, it will start. I’ll pee and it won’t hurt when I’m peeing but after my bladder is empty, it begins. I have pain on the front of my belly and directly on my urethra opening, just all down there hurts. Normally I end up either staying on the toilet for ages, and as my bladder fills up I get the need to keep peeing even if it’s just a tiny bit cause the slightest amount hurts and I feel relief only for like the 20 seconds after I pee, normally have to be curled up and if I can drag myself off the toilet I’d either have to be in a scalding hot bath to relieve the pain or have a hot water bottle on my belly and vagina, or be pointing a hot showerhead directly down there. With heat the pain lessens. 

This pain sometimes lasts for a whole day, sometimes a few hours, it’s really impacting my ability to work etc 

I have previously noticed days after I do something like eat dominos, or these particularly vinegary crisps I like, sometimes coffee, Diet Coke, that the pain tends to correlate with that. 

Also sometimes I think the pain feels worse and happens more often when I’m constipated, which occurs quite consistently for me. Sometimes pooping gives me a little relief 

I’ve tried over counter medication including cocodamol which is the only thing that takes the pain away, paracetamol and Brufen don’t touch the sides. It takes away the pain at first but in the long term I think it makes me more constipated and the pain gets worse. 

This has been ongoing for me for like 5 years atp but in the last two it’s been getting consistently worse, since new years I’ve basically not been able to do nothing and I’m really looking for some answers!! Help pls! 

I also notice sometimes it comes with my period but not always, idk if that’s just coincidence

I put it all together in a pdf so u can read it in detail but here's the tldr:



1.  The Best Strategies are free:

* Meta/Facebook Ads Library research (free).
* Competitor landing page + creative teardown.
* Make multiple ad angles, iterate fast.
* If you're going to make blogs do things that make you seem like an expert in this field eg. if u sell coffee create: How to brew the perfect French Press



2.  Optimisations:

* Link Your Orphans: Ensure every product is reachable within 3 clicks of the homepage. If it’s not linked internally, Google won't rank it.
* Speed Up: Compress images to WebP and delete any unused apps. Shopify stores get ""app bloat"" very easily, which destroys mobile rankings.
* Diversify Search**:** Connect your store to Bing Webmaster Tools. It’s the easiest 5 minute win to get discovered by AI search (ChatGPT/Claude).
* Optimise URLs (use `/products/blue-running-shoes` instead of SKU numbers).
* Check your Sitemap in Search Console to ensure Google can actually see your pages.



3. Things to Avoid:

* Kill the Spam: Stop buying cheap $15 backlink packages and stop mass publishing thin AI content. Google views both as ""noise"" and will eventually penalise you. 
* Stop deleting out of stock product. If that page had any backlinks or authority, you just threw it in the bin so keep the page up, and add an ""Email when in stock"" button.
* Stop relying on “everyone’s selling it” as your only source. Use them to fulfil, not to *discover*. Discovery should come from: ads that are running, customer complaints/reviews, and niche communities.

 

4. Budget/disciplines (half useful, half just vibes):

* You don’t need Kalodata; you need 30 days of disciplined execution
* Do organic / SEO until u can fund ads.
* FOMO is a strategy tax. You pay it with time and money.
* Set a monthly ‘testing budget’ like rent. Non-negotiable.

1qlj3wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qlj3wf/what_flavour_elements_represent_gesha_specialty/,"What flavour elements represent 'gesha' / specialty varietals, and when does processing dominate?","A coffee friend said this week, on trying the recent Wilder Lazo Sidra from Skylark, that it had 'mad floral and berries' and was very sweet, adding that it reminded him of a gesha So I thought it was worth us asking what's going on here...

I'd just had the Hermanos Martha's Gesha - not what I expected! Surprisingly clean for a Hermanos coffee, given my experience with them so far. It has the silky body, light floral aromatics and balanced 'tea-like' and balanced citrus fruit I associate with (washed) gesha, and which is what I believe gesha is known and valued for, but followed gently by the influence of the honey process: a balanced light and clean tropical fruit note - passion fruit seems right, though mango works too. Delicious!

An Ethiopian natural Gesha ([https://tambourine-mango-dblx.squarespace.com/shop/p/benchi-maji-gesha-1931-sfw-submerged-fermentation-washed-yc4wl](https://tambourine-mango-dblx.squarespace.com/shop/p/benchi-maji-gesha-1931-sfw-submerged-fermentation-washed-yc4wl))  is the closest thing I've had to it recently, though that just shifted a little more to juicier (orange) citrus and a stronger tropical note, and a little further from the profile I'd expect in a washed.

I think that gives a pretty reasonable expectation of tasting notes from a gesha, though a particular natural fermentation could push it more towards the purple notes - violet and blueberry.

Even in that 'purple' space, I'd begin to question how much the varietal matters: the more common Ethiopian varieties and other Landraces can produce the same, or potentially even more intense notes.

Setting aside the possibility of flavouring (we can't prove or disprove, but it happens) and pushing fermentation further, Hermanos's Liliana's gesha being a good example, you might get a more layered flavour with a range of fruit and funkiness with possibilities including boozy, yeasty, cheesy and generally bizarre flavours. By this point, I think the varietal is likely bordering on irrelevant, but we still often seem to get the better examples of these weird (Latin) fermentations, when there are prized and pricier varietals in play. I suspect here that in large part, this is correlation rather than causation. The producer has a hard-to-grow varietal they've gone to great lengths to produce, and are likely to invest more time and resources (including human labour, yeasts) into the fermentation - avoiding or at least balancing some of the undesirable (to me) funk notes we often see from naturals and 'advanced' processing from Latin America (and particularly Colombia)

I'm not an expert, and it's very hard to find definitive interpretations of what's really going on across the full supply/value chain, so I'd really welcome any insight from others - how much does varietal matter once we're in funk town, and to what extent are anaerobic processed gesha's and other pricier varietals just a cash-grab driven by importers to take advantage of hype-trains and ignorance from consumers in importing countries?

What Matthew Hussey gets right (and wrong) about modern dating,"Everyone seems to be looking for “the one”… but way too many people are still stuck in dating purgatory. Swiping endlessly. Getting ghosted. Settling for “situationships.” Feeling like something must be wrong with them. It’s exhausting. And parts of modern dating culture (thanks, TikTok therapists and dating “gurus” on IG) have made it worse. So let’s break it down properly. Based on real psych research. Real data. No fluff.  

Relationship coach Matthew Hussey and his book *Get The Guy* have blown up because he tells people (especially women) to stop waiting for the “perfect” partner and start noticing real relationship habits. Some of his advice actually lines up with what the science says but parts of it miss the bigger picture. This post is for anyone feeling stuck, wondering if “the one” even exists anymore, and ready for clarity over chaos.  

Pulled this from top-tier research, podcasts like Esther Perel’s *Where Should We Begin*, and books like *Attached* by Amir Levine, plus multiple studies from Harvard, Stanford, and Pew Research. Here's what you should actually know:  

- **There is no ""one,"" but there are many “right people” depending on how your attachment system is wired.** The book *Attached* explains how our attachment styles (anxious, avoidant, secure) shape everything who we’re drawn to, how we interpret love, and what pulls us into harmful dynamics. People with secure attachment tend to have more stable relationships, and they rarely frame love as some dramatic, all-consuming “meant to be” narrative.  

- **Hussey’s “be high value” advice matters, but it oversimplifies attraction.** Yes, confidence and having a life outside dating increases attraction. But the 2023 Pew study found that what's most correlated with dating success long-term isn’t looks or charisma it’s emotional availability and communication skills. Basically, the “hot & mysterious” trope is mostly a trap for anxious daters. What you actually need is someone consistent, curious, and kind... even if they’re bad at texting sometimes.  

- **The biggest predictor of whether you’ll “find the one” is actually how well you know yourself.** A 2021 Stanford longitudinal study found that people who reflect on their patterns and actively invest in personal growth are 2x more likely to form lasting relationships. Why? Because they break cycles. They stop chasing chemistry and start choosing compatibility.  

- **Date like a scientist, not a romantic.** Hussey emphasizes action going out, initiating, being bold. He’s right on that. Behavioral psychologist Logan Ury, in her book *How to Not Die Alone*, agrees: most people say they want love, but their behavior doesn’t back it. You don’t need a soulmate, you need reps, reflection, and real standards.  

- **Compatibility is built more than it's found.** The myth that “the one” shows up and everything just clicks is… false. Dr. Eli Finkel (Northwestern University) shows that the best relationships are ones where both people grow *into* each other through shared goals, rituals, and conflict resolution styles. That happens *after* the honeymoon phase.  

So yeah, you probably won’t just stumble across “the one” at a coffee shop in Paris. But you can definitely meet *a* great one if you stop chasing ideals and start choosing wisely.

1qlix6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qlix6x/true_story_someone_knew_my_walking_route/,(True Story) Someone Knew My Walking Route,"Every night after work, I take the same walk.

Nothing scenic. Just a loop around my neighborhood to clear my head. Same streets, same pace, headphones in, phone in my pocket. I’ve done it for years without thinking twice.

That’s probably why it took me so long to notice the first sign.

One night, halfway through the walk, I felt my phone vibrate. No notification sound—just a buzz. I stopped under a streetlight and checked.

No message. No missed call.

I shrugged it off and kept walking.

Two nights later, it happened again. Same spot. Same vibration. Still nothing on my phone.

The third time, I slowed down and paid attention. The vibration came exactly as I passed a small park bench near a dead tree. The kind of place you wouldn’t stop unless you had a reason to.

That’s when I noticed something new on the bench.

A disposable coffee cup.

Still warm.

I told myself someone had just been there. Maybe a dog walker. Maybe nothing.

But the next night, the cup was gone. In its place was a folded napkin.

I didn’t touch it. I shouldn’t have looked, but I did.

Written in pen:

“Same time tomorrow?”

My stomach dropped.

I changed my route the next night. Took a longer loop, different streets, avoided the park completely.

No vibration.

No messages.

I started to relax—until three nights later.

I was walking a new street when my phone vibrated again.

This time, it was a text from an unknown number.

“Wrong turn.”

I stopped walking.

The message timestamp matched the vibration exactly.

I turned around slowly. No one nearby. Just parked cars and dark windows.

Another text came in.

“The old bench is easier to see you from.”

I didn’t reply. I went straight home and didn’t walk for weeks.

Eventually, life pushed me back outside. I started walking again, but only during the day. Different routes. Different times.

Months passed. Nothing happened.

Then one afternoon, I found something tucked into my mailbox.

A napkin.

Same handwriting.

Four words this time:

“Night walks suited you.”

I don’t walk anymore.

Not at night.

Not at all.",2,1769247922.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

1qliuja,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sonsofanarchy/comments/1qliuja/soa_fanfiction/,SOA fan-fiction,"The Founding Ride: The Epic Saga of the First 9

In the scorched underbelly of Charming, California, amid the late '60s chaos where Vietnam's ghosts howled through the night and the counterculture ignited like wildfire on gasoline-soaked highways, two unbreakable warriors—and one cunning queen—ignited a revolution on two wheels. John Teller and Piney Winston, with Gemma Teller (née Madock) at JT's side as his wife, didn't just found the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original—SAMCRO—they carved it from the raw flesh of betrayal, war, and defiance. Gemma, a born rebel from Oregon roots, with her preacher father's shadow looming and a fire in her veins that matched JT's dreams, was no mere bystander. She was the club's shadowy architect, weaving alliances with her razor-sharp instincts and a loyalty to the life that often eclipsed her vows. But even in those early days, her devotion was a double-edged blade—fierce for the club, yet tangled with ambitions that whispered of fractures to come.

John Teller, the tormented visionary, was the inferno's spark. Scarred from 'Nam's hellish jungles, where death danced in the shadows and brothers fell like rain, JT's eyes burned with a fevered dream. This wasn't some joyride for thrills and tail; it was a crusade against the iron-fisted system that devoured soldiers and spat out hollow shells. ""We're forging an empire of the free!"" he'd roar over the thunder of engines, his manifestos scrawled in blood-inked notebooks, preaching anarchy as salvation. JT was the pulsating heart, drawing the damned into his orbit with a charisma that could rally the dead. Gemma stood by him, her presence a force multiplier—whispering strategies in the dead of night, her hands bandaging wounds while her words forged unbreakable bonds. Yet beneath her support simmered a restlessness, a queen's hunger for control that JT's ideals sometimes couldn't contain.

Piney Winston, JT's iron-forged co-founder, was the storm's unyielding anchor—a battle-hardened vet whose beard twisted like barbed wire from forgotten foxholes, his lungs poisoned by Agent Orange's vile kiss. He'd stared into the abyss of war's carnage, losing comrades to the mud and his soul to the screams. As enforcer, Piney could silence a room of Hell's Angels castoffs with a glare that pierced like shrapnel. ""We bleed for our own!"" he'd bellow, his war-trophy shotgun eternally vigilant, a sentinel against the encroaching darkness. It was Piney who scouted the prospects, molding them in the crucible of loyalty, his gruff wisdom the club's unbreakable spine—often sharpened by Gemma's cunning vetting, as she sniffed out weakness like a wolf in the pack.

Lenny ""The Pimp"" Janowitz erupted into the fold like a grenade in a foxhole, his Vietnam scars fueling a street-savvy fury. With a pimp's silver tongue and a killer's cold precision, Lenny orchestrated alliances that turned whispers into weapons. But his demons lurked—secrets that chained him to silence, even as prison bars claimed him. In the heat of betrayal, Lenny's unyielding vow became legend: loyalty unto death, a shadow that haunted rivals' nightmares. Gemma recognized his grit, pulling him deeper with calculated encouragement that masked her own agendas.

Keith McGee, the exiled Irish thunder, crashed ashore from Belfast's blood-soaked streets, his IRA ink etched like curses under his cut. A demolitions maestro who'd shattered bridges and dreams alike, Keith transformed their humble garage into an impregnable bastion of booby-traps and blasts. His brogue, thick as whiskey-fueled fog, spun tales of the Troubles that chilled the desert air. ""We're rebels, not rats!"" he'd thunder, as explosions echoed their defiance, blurring the razor-thin line between outlaw and oblivion. Gemma's allure drew him in, her stories around flickering campfires binding him to the family's fraying tapestry.

Wally Grazer, the weathered oracle, hobbled in on a '55 crash's limp, his fifty years a tapestry of road-worn wisdom from the Boozefighters' glory days. He birthed their grim reaper patch on a grease-stained napkin, a harbinger of doom amid black coffee steam. ""This path devours the weak!"" he'd warn, his gravel voice a dirge over endless runs, stoking the flames of purpose as storms raged and tires screamed. Gemma consulted his elder insights, using them to navigate the club's turbulent birth, all while planting seeds of her influence.

Thomas ""Uncle Tom"" Whitney, the wide-eyed prodigy, was innocence thrust into the inferno—barely beyond boyhood, yet entrusted with the ledgers of their burgeoning empire of guns and grit. His youthful fire reminded them of lost purity, a beacon in the encroaching night. But fate's cruel blade struck swift: a treacherous Russian deal erupted in gunfire, ripping Tom from their ranks in a storm of bullets and screams. His fall was the First 9's shattering crucible, forging grief into unbreakable steel. Gemma mourned him with a mother's ferocity, channeling sorrow into a steel resolve that armored the club against future storms.

Chico Villanueva, the barrio blaze, ignited their world with feral energy—a switchblade-wielding wildcard whose laugh masked a tempest of terror. Master of Oakland's shadowy veins, he wove webs of dealers and double-crosses. ""Familia or death!"" he'd snarl through tequila haze, his addictions a serpent coiling ever tighter. The club was his salvation, a fragile leash on the chaos that threatened to consume him whole. Gemma's interventions were a mix of tough love and manipulation, keeping him useful while tightening her grip.

Otto ""Lil' Killer"" Moran, the brooding colossus, loomed like a silent apocalypse—a mechanical savant whose hands rebuilt beasts from scrap, his war-muted tongue belying a fury that earned his moniker in rivers of rival blood. In the aftermath of savage clashes, Otto's steady vigil mended flesh and fractures alike, stitching wounds that mocked mortality. His loyalty was a fortress, unbreached amid the carnage. Gemma coaxed rare confessions from him, turning silence into strength for her visions.

And then came Clarence ""Clay"" Morrow, the final forge—the ambitious predator prospected under Piney's watchful eye. Raw and ravenous, with eyes like smoldering coals, Clay alchemized junk into fortunes, fists into fear. He revered JT and Piney, yet a serpent of ambition slithered within, foreshadowing thrones toppled and brothers broken. It was Clay who masterminded their inaugural heist: storming a convoy of surplus arms under a vengeful moon, declaring, ""This is our reckoning!"" as crates cracked open like Pandora's doom. Gemma eyed his rise with a knowing gleam, her early guidance laced with the sparks of forbidden flames that would one day ignite betrayal.

Their odyssey exploded on Route 66's forsaken blacktop, JT, Gemma, and Piney's vision roaring to life with the First 9's symphony of engines, dust devils swirling like specters of slaughtered dreams. They were no angels; they were avenging demons with a sacred code, erecting SAMCRO from the ashes of brawls, betrayals, and blood-soaked pacts. Midnight raids thundered, alliances cracked like thunder, and the anarchy they craved twisted into a venomous vine, strangling from the inside—Gemma's web of loyalty and intrigue holding it all, a queen whose crown was forged in fire and secrets.

But in the thunderous chronicles of outlaw myth, the First 9—and the woman whose devotion reshaped their destiny—reign eternal—a cataclysmic echo in the gale, a dire prophecy to all who dare: Freedom demands sacrifice, and brotherhood's blade cleaves deepest of all.",0,1769247642.0,Sonsofanarchy,2,0.5,False

I know things weren't easy. I know there were complications. But, how do you go from ""I love you"" to basically ghosting me via text. Almost 2 months now. I didn't believe I would find anyone like you. Were you perfect... hell no... was I, am I... also hell no. But, we fit, we made sense, we had the power to be this beautiful healing relationship.

You asked me to trust you, and impossibly I found I could and I trust no one. You said you wanted to me to feel safe with you, impossibly I opened myself to try and did a bit, more than any other to be sure. The way you felt made me believe in twin flames and soulmates. The way I felt you and am sure you felt me. Maybe, we still do. Filled with passion and joy, we fit so well. So much potential.

I just couldn't take when interactions became mostly shitty excuses. I could have had patience of a saint for you if you had just communicated honestly. That was all I asked - honesty, consistency, respect. I loved you heart and soul. I grieve this loss, this loss of potential to see if we could build something together. I grieve the loss of your hugs that felt like you wanted to squeeze every bit of pain I ever suffered out of me. I grieve the loss of your kisses that felt like you claimed me and burnt a you shaped hole into my armor. Felt like they burnt off all the bad and purified me for you.

I grieve the loss of seeing your smile and hearing your laugh. I grieve the loss of moments, just having coffee. I grieve the loss of hearing the sound of your voice, your presence, taste, scent, just you in all your power, grace and I dont know just fucking you You. I dont think you see yourself well. I think you sell yourself short. I want to hate you, I want to just move on and find literally anyone else just to forget you. But, that's not me, I dont want just anything. I want the right damn thing. You felt like the right damn thing.

You were good for me though in deep hurting truth, reminded me of ways I need to be better. I regret the words I said in anger. \*You reminded me what love feels like. What happiness feels like, I hadn't felt happy for so long. Sure I am happy within my own life, but the happiness of feeling loved, seen, cared about. I hadn't felt that in... maybe ever. Letting go of you, the hope, the potential, the barely got to start has been so hard. I ask myself why I excused the red flags. Why I believed? Why I can't help but still...still feel just love for you.

I know I should just forget you, but I never want to forget you.

I want to hate you, but all I can feel is hope that you are ok mentally and physically. If I can't be with you, just fucking be ok, be well. I wont forget you, I wont block you I would never have to. It felt so unfair, so sudden. I hope you get out of the loop life you have been miserable in. I hope you see its feeding your depression. I hope you find the happiness we almost had.

I know that I want work for an NGO in climate change /animal welfare/human right but I don’t know what type of job doing. I’m 24 years old, I have a degree in marketing and communication, and I did 2 internship and one year working in communication in local ngo. The problem it’s that I don’t like that a lot, I don’t like stay every hours under a computer and the main problem it’s that I saw what I have doing doesn’t have a big impact, it’s was pretty useless. 

So I did music study for 3 years but same I realize that it’s going to be too complicated to find a job so I give up this option (I feel good about it, I love music but I want to do a job that produce concrete change in the world).

So now I move to Brussels, I find an alimentary job in a coffee just for have the time to find what I want to do…

I know my ultimate goal in life is to be kind of an international activism, I think the world is in very bad state and I want to have the most positive high-impact on it. 

But now I’m lost, I reflect for the moment to orient my career around digital marketing / communication for fundraising (for the next 3 years), it’s a better compromise because it have the strategic / concrete / impactful side that just communication officer didn’t have…

My strategy it’s to find an internship paid in this area for having a solid experience in it.

But I feel I’m so late, that I lost the last 3 years and my previous experience was a long time ago, same for my degree (4 years ago). I don’t know how it’s the market for ngo, if they looking a lot for interns, if they have too much demands…

1qlitdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDigitalBreadwin/comments/1qlitdi/hustle_insight_29_how_cocacola_saved_itself_by/,Hustle Insight #29: How Coca-Cola Saved Itself by Ignoring a Century of Success,"Hustlers, today‘s story is about a company that faced its own mortality. After 100+ years of global dominance, Coca-Cola‘s growth had flatlined. The diagnosis was grim: the world was moving on from sugary soda. But instead of panicking or chasing fads, they asked a radical first-principles question:

> **“What are people *actually* buying when they reach for a Coke? Is it brown sugar water, or is it something **far more powerful** that we‘ve forgotten how to sell?”**

**The Scene: Early 2000s, The “Sugar Crisis”**
Health trends were turning against sugary drinks. Coke‘s response was classic corporate scramble: launch dozens of new products (C2, Coke Blak, flavored waters), desperately trying to find the next hit. It failed. Complexity soared, marketing was diluted, and the core brand felt confused. They were losing by trying to be everything to everyone.

**The “First Principles” Breakdown:**
Under a new CEO, James Quincey, Coke stopped looking at spreadsheets and looked at **human psychology and culture.** They realized:
*   **The Commodity:** Sugar, water, caffeine, flavoring.
*   **The Product:** A consistent, refreshing beverage.
*   **The *Real* Product (The Forgotten Truth):** **A moment of happiness, optimism, and universal connection.** Coke wasn‘t a drink; it was **the world‘s most widely recognized symbol of shared joy.**

They had been selling the *commodity* while their brand stood for the *emotion.*

**The Brutal, Simple Inferences & The “One Brand” Strategy:**
Coke made a counter-intuitive pivot: **Simplify to Amplify.**
1.  **Prune the Portfolio:** They ruthlessly cut underperforming brands (over 700 SKUs!), focusing resources.
2.  **Return to the Core:** They stopped apologizing for “Classic Coke.” They doubled down on marketing the **emotional experience and iconic imagery** (e.g., “Share a Coke” campaign).
3.  **Innovate Within the Creed:** New products (Coke Zero Sugar) weren‘t random experiments; they were **extensions of the core brand promise** (“great taste, now with no sugar”), allowing them to adapt without diluting the master brand.
4.  **Become a “Total Beverage Company” Strategically:** They didn‘t just sell soda; they invested in or acquired brands (coffee, water, juice) that served different needs and occasions, but let them operate independently. The portfolio was managed, not mashed together.

**The Result:**
Coke didn‘t just survive; it reinvigorated its core. By returning to its fundamental purpose—selling **happiness in a bottle**—it cut through the noise of a health-conscious market. The “Share a Coke” campaign, which put names on bottles, was a genius move: it made a global brand feel personal, leveraging the very “connection” it stood for. They proved that a century-old brand‘s greatest asset isn‘t its secret formula, but its **permission to make people feel something positive.**

**The Hustle Insight:**
When you‘re stuck, don‘t just add more. **Go back to your atomic unit of value—the deepest, most emotional reason people first chose you.** Strip away the complexity and noise, and ask: “What is the **one thing** we deliver that no one else can?” Often, growth comes not from frantic expansion, but from a **ruthless and profound recommitment to your core truth.**

---

**Your Turn: The “Core Truth” Investigator Challenge**
To train as a **“Strategic Thinker”**:

Everywhere I went (school, uni, previous jobs) I’ve always had good interactions and connection with people, and never really had any conflict with people either.

I recently quit a job that shattered my confidence and my mental health. I worked in a team of 7 people and because i worked with them day to day, I felt comfortable enough to be myself (i.e. share things about myself as you would in casual conversations - I later regretted this because now I feel very exposed to people that don’t like me). As time went on, I felt like the odd one out. It was a team of mostly guys, with one other girl including myself. They were all close, they’d have lunches/coffee together and not include me. I know they would talk about me too. Honestly, I don’t know what caused them to become cold towards me, so I began to isolate myself from them. The job started getting stressful, and I felt like a lot of blame was put on me. A new guy started in a lead position and would speak down to me & would treat the others well. I got the general feeling that everyone disliked me.

The company became a toxic place for everyone, but this was my individual experience. The company was going through radical changes with new management (few people were let go, and I felt like I was next).

Anyway, I understand that work is work, that you’re not there for friendships (that used to be the type of advice I would give people). It’s just that this whole situation has made me feel small, like an outsider, my confidence is gone and I feel like a joke. I resigned, but I still find myself thinking about my experience and I feel so sad.

**Question**: For anyone who’s gone through anything similar, how did you move on from the bad experience and not allow it to occupy your thoughts and make you feel like shit?",1,1769247495.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

I Built a Life Without You
😍What happens next👉Click Here to read on👉
MY HUSBAND Christopher Cavill presented A RING to Rowena Grant—his childhood sweetheart.
But this time, I couldn't care less. I APPLAUDED COOLLY.
Christopher FROZE.
I tossed my wedding ring aside and turned to leave.
Christopher chased after me, panic written all over his face.
""Yelena, let me explain. It's not like that. Rowie and I are innocent.""
I pushed his hand away, ""You're a good match.""
""I'm not with her! Why can't you believe me?"" he insisted, his voice rising.
""Christopher, you're a grown man. This isn't a good look.""
His face went pale. Perhaps realization hit him then.
Six months ago, when I'd caught him and Rowena entering a hotel together and confronted him, this was exactly what he'd said to me.
Now, the roles were reversed, and the hurt in his eyes was unmistakable.
I ignored him and simply walked out of his sight.
Chapter 1
At our seventh wedding anniversary party, Christopher Cavill presented a ring to Rowena Grant—his childhood sweetheart.
I applauded coolly. In response, Christopher berated me in front of everyone.
""I'm just messing around with my friend. Why are you being so petty? If Rowie and I really had feelings for each other, you wouldn't have ended up marrying me.""
He stormed out in a rage. That same night, Rowena changed her Instagram profile photo to a sweet pic of her and Christopher holding hands.
Before, I would've rushed to her place, dragged Christopher out, and demanded to know whether he loved me or not.
But this time, I couldn't care less.
***
Christopher didn't come home until the next day.
When he came in, I was cleaning up the mess in the backyard.
Yesterday had been our seventh wedding anniversary.
He once said, ""Everyone says the seven-year itch is unavoidable, but I don't believe that.
""When we hit seven years, we'll invite all our friends and family over. I want everyone to see how happy we are.""
Because of his promise, I'd started preparing for our anniversary party three months in advance.
Every evening after work, no matter how exhausted I was, I forced myself to learn how to bake, mix drinks, and cook dishes I had never attempted before.
Yet, the party I poured everything into became a stage for Christopher and Rowena to flirt.
He even stayed out all night for her.
""What happened to your hand?"" Christopher noticed the cut on my index finger and asked casually.
""I cut it while cooking yesterday,"" I replied.
He scoffed. ""You can't even handle something this simple. Tell me—can you do anything right?""
The old me couldn't stand having the slightest flaw in his eyes.
One sharp remark from him would have been enough to spark a half-hour argument, followed by an almost obsessive pursuit of perfection.
But now, I was too tired to say even one extra word.
As if sensing my displeasure, Christopher bent down and took my hand. ""I'll do it.""
I pulled away. He stubbornly followed, refusing to let go.
During the struggle, I tripped over a stool.
He laughed. ""Geez. How can you be so clumsy?""
I said nothing, my brows knitting together as a wave of pain surged through me.
That was when he finally noticed the blood between my legs.
He quickly pulled me up. ""I'll take you to the hospital!""
The pain in my lower abdomen was severe, and a bad feeling settled in my chest. I didn't refuse.
The moment we entered the hospital lobby, we ran into Rowena.
Her face was pale as she leaned weakly into Christopher's arms. ""Chris, my stomach's acting up again. It hurts so much.""
He held her, then turned to me. ""Guess you're just on your period. It's nothing serious. Just go get yourself checked in. Rowie's condition is bad. I can't leave her alone. I'll take her to the ER.""
I nodded. ""Okay.""
He paused, frowning at me in confusion. ""You aren't mad?""
I didn't get it.
Why would I be mad?
Did I need to make a scene like I used to?
But I simply didn't care anymore.
Whatever he and Rowena did had nothing to do with me.
""If there's nothing else, I'll go check in.""
I turned and walked away. His footsteps gradually faded, but I didn't look back.
Later, the bleeding worsened. A nurse at the triage desk noticed and rushed me to the OB-GYN.
The doctor told me that I'd miscarried.
""Where's your family? You'll need a D&C procedure. We need a family member to sign the consent form,"" she asked.
I touched my lower abdomen numbly and replied, ""I don't have any family.""
Chapter 2
I signed the consent form myself and went into surgery alone.
From the anesthesia to the moment I fully woke up, three hours passed. Christopher never asked about me once.
That evening, when he came home, I was lying on the couch, staring blankly into space.
He glanced at the kitchen. ""Why didn't you cook?""
For seven years of marriage, whenever he came home, there was always a hot meal waiting.
Even when I worked overtime, I'd order his favorite takeout in advance.
This was the first time he'd come home to a cold stove and an empty kitchen.
He clearly expected me to get up immediately. Instead, I said flatly, ""If you want to eat, cook something yourself.""
Christopher frowned and handed me a bag.
""I remember you tend to get period cramps, so I bought you some heat packs.""
I turned my head and met his gaze. ""I don't need them. Give them to someone who does.""
What he didn't know was that ten minutes earlier, Rowena had posted a photo on her Instagram story—a heat pack pressed against her stomach.
The hand in the photo was his left one, the one wearing his wedding ring.
The photo had already been deleted, but I knew these heat packs were her leftovers.
They were just like Christopher, who only came back to me once Rowena no longer needed him.
Christopher tore one open anyway, insisting on sticking it on me.
I shoved him away. His waist slammed into the coffee table, and his face twisted in pain.
""Yelena Swanson, what's wrong with you?"" he snapped. ""Rowie's stomach condition flared up, and you're just on your period. Don't you know what matters more? Why do you have to blow this up?""
I met his anger calmly. ""Christopher, it wasn't my period. I miscarried.""
He froze.
Chapter 3
After a long pause, he let out a mocking laugh. ""Is this your way of making me feel sorry for you?
""Don't forget—we had tests done seven years ago. You were told it'd be extremely hard for you to get pregnant. Lying about something like this is disgusting. Don't you feel ashamed?""
I once desperately wanted to build a complete family with Christopher.
When I learned how difficult it would be for me to conceive, I collapsed in tears.
Over the years, I secretly went through countless treatments. Every ovulation cycle, I clung to him, hoping for good news. Unfortunately, there were never any.
Ironically, when I finally let go, the child came.
Just as cruelly, the day I learned of his existence was the day I lost him forever.
Maybe this was a warning—an omen of the end for Christopher and me.
I sat up. ""Believe it or don't. I don't care.""
I picked up the heat pack from the floor, tossed it into the trash, grabbed my backpack, and walked out.
""Are you running away from home?"" he demanded.
I answered calmly, ""My best friend just moved. She asked me to stay over for a couple of days.""
Christopher chased after me, his brows drawn tightly together.
It was the first time he'd ever stopped me when I left.
Before, he'd only watch coldly. No matter whose fault it was, I'd always come crawling back within days.
This time, I didn't want to.
I walked past him, stepped into the elevator, and pressed close.
Half an hour later, I arrived at Lindsay Keaton's place.
When I told her about the miscarriage, she held me and stayed up talking with me for hours.
During that time, I never messaged Christopher, but he sent me a single question mark.
I ignored it. The next morning, another message came through.
""Breakfast outside sucks.""
I was still calmly eating, and Lindsay stared at me in disbelief. ""I can't believe you didn't rush back to make him breakfast.""
I smiled faintly and hummed.
In the past, one word from him was enough to make me drop everything.
Now, I was completely exhausted.
Lindsay said sincerely, ""You're finally choosing yourself.""
I stared at the ceiling for a long moment. ""Lindy, you're a divorce attorney. What should I do if I want a divorce?""
She sprang upright and rattled off a long list of legal terms.
I barely understood any of it, but she waved it off. ""Just leave it to me.""
I stayed with her peacefully and didn't reply to Christopher for days.
Five days later, my mother-in-law, Matilda Cavill, posted a photo in the family group chat, saying her birthday was coming up, yet hardly anyone had returned early to keep her company.
The photo showed the family seated at the table.
Christopher was there, and beside him, nestled far too closely, was Rowena.
Chapter 4
Less than ten minutes after the photo was posted, Christopher called me. ""Lena, don't get the wrong idea. My mom planned this. I couldn't exactly say no, so—""
I cut him off, ""I know. Anything else?""
""You're not mad?""
I chuckled and asked, ""Why would I be?""
Christopher fell silent.
After a moment, he said, ""This Saturday's my mom's birthday. I'll come pick you up.""
He hung up immediately, as if afraid I might refuse.
On Saturday morning, Christopher arrived at Lindsay's place.
As soon as the car stopped, Rowena leaned out from the passenger seat. ""Lena, hurry up! We've been waiting forever.""
She seemed every bit like the lady of the house.
In the past, I would've dragged her out of the passenger seat and forced Christopher to choose who belonged there.
This time, I simply nodded and got into the back seat.
Christopher tightened his grip on the steering wheel and glanced at me through the rearview mirror.
I gave a polite smile, then lowered my head and chatted with Lindsay.
At the Cavill's residence, I took out the birthday gift I'd prepared. ""Happy birthday, Matilda.""
Then, I sat down and ate quietly.
Christopher and Rowena sat on either side of me, leaning toward each other and laughing openly.
I stood up. ""Why don't we switch seats? It'll be easier for you two to talk.""
Everyone was stunned.
Just months ago, I'd caused a full-blown scene over Rowena insisting on sitting next to Christopher, pointing at her and calling her a homewrecker.
No one expected me to say something like this so calmly.
Rowena happily slid into my seat. Christopher, however, stared at me darkly.
I went to the restroom.
When I returned, the atmosphere was warm and cheerful.
I heard Rowena say, ""Mrs. Cavill, it's your birthday. Why are you giving me a gift?""
Following her gaze, I saw Matilda holding an emerald bracelet, fastening it around Rowena's wrist.
Christopher didn't stop her, but everyone else looked uneasy.
They all knew what that bracelet meant—it was a family heirloom, meant for the daughter-in-law.
When Christopher and I married, Matilda had never approved. She thought I wasn't good enough.
Years without children only worsened her dissatisfaction. The bracelet was never meant for me.
On her previous birthday, she'd already wanted to give it to Rowena.
I'd objected to it. When Rowena reached for it, I'd lashed out.
We'd both fallen into the flowerbed during the struggle. Christopher hadn't hesitated—he pulled Rowena out first, then turned on me viciously.
""It's just a bracelet. Haven't you got enough? Why are you fighting Rowie over this? Have I spoiled you too much? I'll just buy you another one. It's not a big deal.""
I caught a cold and ran a fever for two days straight.
Christopher scolded me coldly, ""Serves you right. That's what you get for being childish.""
But now, I no longer wanted to fight anyone.
I walked over, picked up my bag, and excused myself gracefully.
With that, I went home.
Christopher arrived moments later, his face dark with fury.
""Yelena, know your limits. You disappear for days, and today, with everyone present, you decide to sulk? How can you be so rude?""
When I stayed silent, he loosened his tie and sneered.
""Are you really throwing a tantrum now? Fine. Let's just get divorced.""
This was the third time Christopher had brought it up.
The first was when I refused a drink offered by his boss and embarrassed him.
To make it up to him, I met the boss again, drank until my stomach bled, and begged for his forgiveness while hooked to an IV.
The second time was when I accidentally broke a puzzle Rowena had given him.
He'd flown into a rage. I'd knelt in front of him, crying and promising it would never happen again.
But this time, I looked at him and said, ""Okay.""

1qliij3,https://i.redd.it/c43cmftrl9fg1.png,"Sorry, I'm Mated To The Commander","Collect My Husband

""Can you believe it? The Sullivans' real daughter, the one who went missing ten years ago, has finally been found,"" one lady whispered.



""Goodness, that's wonderful. But what will become of the girl they adopted?"" another lady replied, her voice full of concern.



""Oh, that's not all. I've heard that the long-lost heiress and the adopted daughter's fiancé got very close during his rut,"" the first lady added, her tone dropping even lower.



""If I were in her shoes, I don't think I could bear to stay under the same roof another day,"" the second lady murmured, shaking her head.



A stunning young woman with long hair stood by the window, rubbing her throbbing temples. She frowned slightly. 'Strange, I did drink a lot last night, but it shouldn't have knocked me out that completely.'



The low whispers drifting in from outside caught her attention. Recognizing the gossip was about her, she let out a self-deprecating laugh.



Ten years ago, Xanthe Sullivan, the beloved daughter of the noble Sullivan family on Alpha Prime, went missing in a spaceship crash.



The Sullivan family was heartbroken. Later, they adopted a little girl named Layla from the Wastelands-9 Orphan Core, who looked a bit like Xanthe and was about the same age. They renamed the girl Layla Sullivan.



A decade later, Xanthe was found. Of course, the Sullivan family was overjoyed. They poured all their love onto Xanthe, buying her favorite clothes, jewelry, as well as the latest optical computers and aero-vehicles.



They even made Layla move out of her house, all because Xanthe had remarked one day, ""Layla's house is so pretty.""



The Sullivan family spared no effort in spoiling Xanthe. None of this came as a surprise to Layla. After all, she was only adopted, while Xanthe was the family's real daughter.



Layla moved out quietly and tried her best to be kind to Xanthe. What she never imagined, however, was that her own fiancé had spent his rut with Xanthe.



Shaking off the thought, Layla let out a slow yawn and turned to pack her things. She was leaving for Imperial Academy. 'It's time to leave the Sullivans anyway,' she told herself.



Packing didn't take long. She had little to bring, and wanted nothing from the Sullivan family. She put on her white and blue freshman uniform, tucking the cuffs into her black boots. Looking into the mirror, she tied her hair into a neat ponytail.



The only thing left was her optical computer, a birthday gift from her eldest brother Nolan Sullivan two years ago. Nolan had always been kind to her. He'd been stationed on an alien planet supervising energy operations and hadn't been home in half a year.



But Layla knew that even Nolan would surely dote on Xanthe more. She decided to format the optical computer, wiping all her data clean, before returning it to the Sullivans for good.



Just as she was about to format the computer, a notification from Prime AI flashed. \[Ms. Layla Sullivan, your Genetic Pairing Program application has been received. Data processing in progress. Genetic comparison ongoing.\]



Layla froze, her fingers going numb. The watch-like optical computer slipped from her grasp, hitting the floor with a sharp clatter.



On Alpha Prime, there were two ways to marry. The first was free love and marriage, chosen by most. The second was the Genetic Pairing Program.



Once one applied, Prime AI would compare their genes with every eligible unmarried person on the planet. The highest match led to an automatic marriage. In short, it was like asking Prime AI to assign a spouse.



But this second option had mostly fallen out of use. It was seen as cold and impersonal, often leading to unhappy marriages. Almost no one chose it anymore.



A cold glint flashed in Layla's eyes. 'Who got into my optical computer and submitted that application?' She walked straight out and called for the robot butler. ""Who entered my room last night?""



The robot butler's electronic eyes flickered. Without another word, Layla reached over and accessed its central control system, pulling up the surveillance feed from the night before, during which she had been drunk and sound asleep.



The records had been deleted, but recovering the data was no trouble for Layla. Within minutes, the restored footage showed a figure slipping into her room.



It was Xanthe. What's more, the footage also clearly showed that last night, Xanthe had furtively put something into Layla's drink.



\*\*\*\*\*



The Sullivan kitchen was spacious. Most of their meals were handled by household robots, but this morning, Xanthe was bustling around. She was in a white dress, her curly hair pulled back, with a pink apron tied over her dress.



She looked at her mother Harper Sullivan, who stood nearby, and said, ""Mom, the oatmeal I made probably isn't as perfect as the robot's.""



Harper, a gentle-looking lady, looked at Xanthe with tender eyes. ""Nothing tastes better than the oatmeal my daughter makes herself.""



Xanthe smiled, about to reply when hurried footsteps cut through the quiet kitchen. Before she could turn fully, Layla walked straight up and slapped her hard across the face.



Xanthe covered her cheek, tears instantly filling her eyes. ""Layla, why did you slap me?"" She looked so hurt and fragile that anyone watching would have felt sorry for her.



Harper's eyes reddened. She pulled Xanthe into a protective hug and glared at Layla. ""Layla, what has gotten into you? How could you slap Xanthe like that?""



""Ask Xanthe what she did to my optical computer last night,"" Layla replied, her voice icy and flat.



""That still doesn't give you the right to slap her, no matter what she might have done,"" Harper shot back, holding Xanthe closer.



A cold smile twisted Layla's lips. ""What if I told you she used my optical computer to apply for the Genetic Pairing Program in my name?""



Harper froze. She turned to look at Xanthe in her arms. Xanthe's tears fell freely down. ""Mom, I didn't mean to. I just wanted to download some study materials from her optical computer.



""You know Layla got into Imperial Academy, but I never had the chance to learn properly when I was gone. I wanted to study hard this year and try the exam next time.



""She was drunk and asleep last night. I didn't want to disturb her, so I tried to get the files myself. I must have pressed something wrong and sent off some kind of application by mistake. I would never do this on purpose, I swear.""



The more Harper listened, the more her heart ached. 'My poor daughter suffered so much out there alone.' And the thought of it, as always, filled her with a sharp pang of guilt.



She turned back to Layla, her expression stern. ""Layla, no matter what, Xanthe didn't mean it. If you're unhappy with the match they give you, we will cover all the costs for an annulment.""



Layla looked at the lady who had once been so kind to her, now speaking of her forced marriage as if it were nothing. A deep chill settled in her chest.



""Do you know what else she did last night?"" Layla's voice was low and steady. ""She slipped into the kitchen and put something in my drink.



""Then she sneaked into my room and used my optical computer to submit that application. She just wants me to leave this house for good.""



Harper looked shocked, her face losing its color. ""That's impossible,"" she said, her voice tight. She refused to believe her own daughter could do something so low.



Layla's tone remained calm. ""Believe what you want. I've already sent all the surveillance footage to your email.""



Harper looked at her sobbing daughter. After a heavy pause, she spoke with pained reluctance. ""Layla, Xanthe couldn't have meant any real harm. Can you forgive her?



""You know how much she suffered out there. And I raised you for ten years. Can't those ten years of care count for something? Can't they make you a little more understanding toward her?""



Each word felt like a needle. The sharper the pain grew inside Layla, the quieter she became. ""Mrs. Sullivan, I do remember those ten years. You spent 168,000 starcoins on me. I will pay back every last one."" With that, she turned to go.



Harper finally registered what Layla had called her. She froze where she stood. ""Layla, you called me Mrs. Sullivan. Are you really ending everything between us over something like this?""



Xanthe looked up and saw the conflict and sorrow in her mother's eyes. She suddenly began to sob even louder. ""It's all my fault. Layla, you must still be angry about Caleb and me.



""If you're upset, just blame me. But please, Layla, the Sullivans raised you for ten years. How can you be so cold? You're going to break Mom and Dad's hearts.""



Layla turned around and saw the tears welling in Harper's eyes. A bitter realization washed over her. 'From beginning to end, I was the only villain. With Xanthe here, my life would never be as peaceful as before. If they want to spoil her rotten, fine. I'll leave.'



Right then, a soft beep came from her optical computer. She glanced down and found the marriage application had been approved. Without a word, she formatted the device and dropped it onto the floor. Then she turned and walked toward the door.



""Layla, where are you going?"" Harper called out, her voice trembling. No matter what, she had still raised Layla for ten years, and that kind of bond wasn't easy to simply let go of.



Layla waved a hand over her shoulder without turning around. ""To the Central Nexus,"" she replied, her tone flat. ""Going to collect my husband.""



Chapter 2 Do You Like My Pheromones?

The Central Nexus of Alpha Prime was located at the heart of Prime City, handling nearly all the daily affairs of the planet's residents. Civil marriage matters were processed on the 14th floor of the Central Tower.



Layla took a public aero-vehicle to the Central Nexus and entered through the iris scanner. As soon as she stepped inside, a polished man in silver uniform and glasses approached her. ""Are you Ms. Layla Sullivan?"" the man asked.



Layla nodded. The man went on, ""Please follow me to the VIP lounge. Your genetic match is already waiting.""



""Thank you, please lead the way,"" Layla said. She had no plan to go through with a forced marriage. She intended to explain clearly to her match that she hadn't filed the application herself.



Besides, now that she'd cut ties with the Sullivans, she was broke. She was sure her match wouldn't want someone with nothing to offer. As long as he refused, the Genetic Pairing would be canceled automatically.



She followed the staff member down what felt like an endlessly long corridor. Other people they passed kept glancing curiously at her, but whenever she looked back, they quickly turned away.



Layla frowned slightly, feeling something was off. But with this being her first marriage, she couldn't tell if that was normal. 'Maybe they're staring because I used the Genetic Pairing Program. Hardly anyone does that anymore.'



Layla turned to the staff member. ""What's my match like?"" Even though she didn't plan to marry him, she wanted to know who she'd be dealing with.



The staff member seemed nervous. He adjusted his glasses. ""You'll see when you meet him,"" he said, as if he didn't dare to say more.



They finally stopped outside the lounge. Its door bore a gilded emblem, which looked strangely familiar to Layla. The staff member said respectfully, ""Ms. Sullivan, please go in. Your match is already inside.""



Layla looked puzzled. ""Aren't you coming in with me?"" She hadn't expected to be left alone with a complete stranger.



The staff member hesitated, then shook his head. ""Marriage is a private matter. It's better if you talk alone first. If you need anything, coffee, for example, just ask the service robot inside.""



Layla nodded. ""Your service has been very helpful. Do you take reviews? I'll give you nine stars,"" she said, genuinely appreciating his polite manner.



The man's expression shifted slightly. He kept his smile with some effort. ""Thank you. If you're satisfied later, I would be happy to accept a nine-star review.""



His words felt odd to her, and he seemed almost too respectful. 'Maybe he still thinks I'm Karter Sullivan's daughter,' she thought. Karter Sullivan, after all, was a duke.



Then she shrugged the thoughts off, turning and pushing the door open. It slid shut slowly behind her with a soft hum.



The room was bright, lit by floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the crisscrossing aerial lanes outside. Layla recognized at once that the furnishings were top-grade.



The wine cabinet held all kinds of rare vintages, and the circular red sofa in the middle was upholstered in upper-tier starbeast hide, soft to the touch.



Then she noticed the air was thick with the scent of cedar. It was the smell of pheromones. Her gaze moved to the carpet by the window, where an extraordinarily beautiful young man stood.



His features were striking. Leaning against the window, his height was hard to judge, but his long legs suggested he was tall. He wore a plain white shirt and black trousers, the cuffs and waist finely embroidered. The clothes spoke of quiet expense.



His silver-gray hair fell in loose strands across his forehead, but it didn't hide his arresting eyes, which were wide and clear like a starry sky. And he was watching her, unblinking. Behind him, several large, fluffy white tails swayed gently.



'He's breathtaking.' As Layla breathed in the rich cedar scent, the air in the room seemed to grow warmer. ""Your pheromones smell good,"" Layla said before she could stop herself.



""Do you like it?"" The young man's voice was slightly husky, yet incredibly pleasing to the ear, like music from an ancient instrument.



Layla's heart gave a small jump, but she kept her voice steady. ""I should explain. I didn't submit the marriage application. I came to talk things through with you. But right now, I think you should take a suppressant first.""



The young man's fluffy white fox ears twitched. His long lashes lowered briefly, as if trying to clear the haze from his mind. It was clear his rut had taken over, leaving his shifter instincts mostly in control.



Looking at those soft ears, Layla felt a restless urge inside her chest, like a cat gently scratching. 'This is bad. His pheromones are starting to get to me. Fox shifters' scent really is tempting.'



She cleared her throat, trying to settle herself. ""Did you forget to bring your suppressant? I'll go out and ask for one,"" she said, already turning toward the door.



She moved quickly, because the urge to close the distance and kiss him was already too strong. If she stayed any longer, she wasn't sure she could hold back.



Since Layla had fully awakened as a shifter, she'd never come across pheromones she liked this much. As for her former fiancé, Caleb James, she had never even caught his scent.



Caleb had always been polite and proper, telling her he would rely on suppressants during his rut until after their wedding. Yet he ended up spending his rut with Xanthe instead.



Layla liked everything about the stunning fox-eared young man before her. His scent, his look and his voice were all annoyingly perfect. He was exactly her type, and in every way, he outshone Caleb completely.



Still, Layla clung to her last bit of sense. 'I came here to end this arrangement. If Xanthe hadn't applied for it with my optical computer, he wouldn't be involved at all. Taking advantage of him in his rut wouldn't be right.'



But just as she reached the door and gripped the handle, the cedar scent grew suddenly stronger behind her. ""Star, don't go, please,"" the young man said.



His voice was so close that she felt his warm breath against her ear. Both of her ears flushed pink instantly, and she spun around.



Chapter 3 Can You Do Me A Favor?

The silver-haired young man, who had been by the window, was now standing right beside Layla. He stood a full head taller than her, despite her own height of 5'7"".



They stood so close that it felt like she was already in his arms. Layla took a step back and bumped against the metal doorknob with a soft thud. 'Ouch! That's going to leave a bruise,' she thought.



When she looked up, the young man stepped forward again, closing the distance between them. His warm breath brushed her cheeks, making them burn.



His striking blue eyes fixed on hers, full of wounded confusion, like a child who'd been pushed away. ""Do you hate me?"" he asked, his voice low and rough.

1qligjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/centralcoastnsw/comments/1qligjg/cool_people_listening_to_good_music/,Cool People Listening to Good Music?,"Hey locals 👋

I wanted to float an idea and see if there’s genuine interest before taking it any further.

I’m getting into listening to records and realised there are no real spaces locally just to listen to records together (unless there's is and I'd love to know!). Not gigs, not DJs but just people bringing records they love, playing them and hanging out.

Was thinking a small, community listening night.

People bring a record (or just come to listen), we play a side or a few tracks each, chat between plays, drink coffee or beers, and keep it relaxed and respectful.

More about curiosity, connection, and slowing down than a DJ night or gig .

Thinking low volume enough to talk, good sound, mixed tastes welcome, no gatekeeping. More chill coffee shop energy rather than nightclub.

I’m not trying to make money, just wondering if there are some people locally who’d actually want something like this occasionally (monthly / casual). I'm based in Ettalong so ideally on the peninsula but would be happy to travel for the right crowd and happy to organise. 

Before I approach any venues, I just wanted to see whether anyone would you come along to something like this?

Open to thoughts, tweaks, or ideas too. Cheers",5,1769246221.0,centralcoastnsw,4,1.0,False

1qliew6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KeatsChinese/comments/1qliew6/是_shì_expressing_existence/,“是 (shì) ”Expressing Existence,"

Besides indicating judgment or identity, 是 (shì) can also express the existence of people or things alone. It often follows directional or location words, serving as a concise way to express existence in spoken Chinese. It is similar in usage to the existential verb 有 (yǒu), and is more commonly used in casual daily speech.

Basic Sentence Pattern

Location/Direction + 是 (shì) + Person/Thing

(No subject; the location is placed at the beginning of the sentence to highlight there is somebody/something somewhere.)

Key Reminders for HSK Level 1 (Chinese-English)

1.	This usage has no negative form. To express there is no somebody/something somewhere, use Location + 没有 (méi yǒu) + Person/Thing directly, instead of 不是 (bú shì).

2.	No measure word is needed after 是 (shì) (a basic requirement for HSK1). Directly use nouns for people/things, which conforms to spoken habits.

Simple Difference from 有 (yǒu) for Existence (HSK1 Friendly)

是 (shì) for existence: More colloquial and concise, used for casual descriptions.

有 (yǒu) for existence: Universal for formal and spoken Chinese, a basic existential pattern with the negative form 没有 (méi yǒu).

1qlidh7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qlidh7,What's up with this foul?,"I just watched the EvW match of Brian Shaw vs Brandon Allen. In the video at around 10:00 Allen very obviously lifts his elbow, as he is about to lose the round, so as to get a foul instead of a loss. 

I went on the EvW website and looked at the rules where it states:

>**4.5.10** \- Any foul committed when the competitor’s hand is in a losing position will result in a foul and loss of the round.

I have seen this happen countless times, and I have never seen anybody lose a round for this (unless they already had 2 fouls). 

My question is: What's the matter with that? Do the refs not know the rules? Is it some sort of insider code, that this rule isn't enforced?

1qliagt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llrJoxmhnHA,"50 years ago, one of the most bizarre moments in 70s television: Mary Tyler Moore variety special re-enacts biblical episodes with weird song-and-dance numbers; Ben Vereen plays the devil; pink-tuxedoed vampire sings Sympathy for the Devil mixed with Hallelujah Chorus","""Mary’s Incredible Dream,"" which aired on CBS on January 22, 1976.

Mary Tyler Moore teamed up with producer Jack Good (who was known for avant-garde, trippy musical projects) to create a special that was less like a standard variety show and more like a fever dream based on the Bible and the history of humanity.

The special begins with Mary falling asleep and ascending to ""heaven."" Heaven is depicted as the inside of a massive, glowing vintage radio. Mary is greeted by the acapella group Manhattan Transfer (who had Top 40 hits around this time), who are dressed as Radio Angels in white tuxedos and gowns.

Instead of pearly gates, the entrance is a series of Art Deco neon tubes and dials. Arthur Fiedler (conductor of the Boston Pops) stands atop a podium that looks like a speaker component, conducting a choir of angels.

To move between ""human eras,"" the screen would often dissolve through static or tuning noises, emphasizing that Mary was ""tuning in"" to different points in human history.

The show attempts to tell the story of the 'eternal cycle of man,' creation, the fall from grace, and rebirth. So we get:

\- Adam and Eve: Mary played Eve, with Cajun fiddler Doug Kershaw as Adam and Ben Vereen as Lucifer.

\- Before God floods the earth, Mary sings Java Jive (I love coffee, I love tea...)  I missed the reason for this one.

\- Noah’s Ark is re-enacted in this way: Mary and Ben Vereen as Mr. and Mrs. Noah, floating (for some unexplained reason) on a giant pair plaster-of-Paris hands of God while the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower poke out of the water in the background, like it's Planet of the Apes.  They sing 'Morning Has Broken', in the arrangement by Cat Stevens.

\- The caveman era of mankind:  Mary singing into a dinosaur-bone microphone, performs a cover of ""Nobody Does It Like Me,"" a song from the recent 1973 Broadway musical Seesaw. ""If there's a wrong way to keep it cool, a right way to be a fool, nobody does it like me""

Mary Tyler Moore, dressed in glittery green pseudo-military costume, sings a British recruiting song from a 1914 revue:  ""On Friday I’m a-missing, but on Saturday I’m willing, If you’ll only take the Shilling, To make a man of any one of you!""

Manhattan Transfer performs""Sympathy for the Devil,"" with the lead taken by a devil figure wearing a red and pink tuxedo (? do tuxedos have swallow tails)  The minor devil characters in the chorus are decked out in glittery, campy pink & red outfits, stalking the stage in a way that feels like a psychedelic rock opera.  Somehow the Hallelujah Chorus is mixed in, and then it transitions to some kid of religious vision of monks and clergy from different parts of the world lighting candles.

The special ended with Mary singing Steven Sondheim’s ""I'm Still Here,"" which is maybe a meta-commentary on the bizarre hour of television she has just survived (and I survived, watchng this thing, even 50 years later). 

In her 1995 memoir, *After All*, Mary Tyler Moore explained that this special was originally going to be titled *Mary Tyler Moore Explains the History of the World*. Do you think she was inspired by Thornton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth, which was also a panorama of the history of humanity?",1,1769245610.0,Crazy_retro_stories,0,1.0,False

**The Setup:**
Six locations around our city, each revealing the next clue through GPS check-ins. Started at our first date spot, ended at the surprise party location. Mixed riddles, photo challenges, and mini-missions at each stop.

**What Worked:**
- GPS triggers were clutch - no confusion about ""am I at the right place?""
- Built in a 2-hour time window so it didn't feel rushed
- Mixed solo and group challenges (some they could do alone, others needed help from our friends who were ""planted"" at locations)
- Each location had a small memory attached - our favorite coffee shop, the park where we adopted our dog, etc.

**What I'd Change:**
- Parking was a nightmare downtown. Should've picked more walkable locations or warned them ahead
- One riddle was way too hard - they were stuck for 20 minutes. Keep it challenging but not frustrating
- Weather contingency plan! Didn't think about rain

**Best Moment:**
The second-to-last location was our favorite bookstore. Challenge was ""find the book that started our relationship"" (we both reached for the same book on a shelf 3 years ago). The owner helped me set it up with a note inside. My partner absolutely lost it.

**Tech Note:**
Used a platform that let me set GPS boundaries and unlock clues automatically. Way better than the paper version I did for my sister's hunt where half the clues blew away.

If you're on the fence about doing something like this - totally worth the planning time. Way more memorable than dinner and drinks.",0,1769245422.0,scavengerhunt,0,0.5,False

1qli6t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxietypilled/comments/1qli6t2/someplace_cold_and_dark_full_of_things_that_are/,"Someplace Cold and Dark, Full of Things that are Old and Broken","I drove. My destination was simply *away*. I drove as if speed and distance could separate me from what I did. A long, fast burn down the interstate with eyes full of tears. 

Snow began to fall and I left the highway. I turned onto a state road, then onto a smaller road. I had no idea where I was and I didn’t care where the road went. The snowflakes directly in my path flew at and around the windshield like stars slipping past a spaceship jumping to hyperspace in a sci-fi movie. If only I could really fall into hyperspace and come out somewhere impossibly far away. Impossibly different from here. Someplace where I was different.

I was mesmerized by the snow flowing around the truck and I drifted onto the shoulder. I steered back onto the road and slowed down. Getting mutilated in a wreck would be a good start to accepting the universe’s payback for what I did to Casey.  But no. If I crashed, I’d probably just end up hurting someone else. Some other driver who didn’t deserve the suffering that I deserved. 

My head swam with guilt. I could hardly see the road through the snow and the tears. I had no idea what to do. Maybe it was time to stop driving. 

A few seconds after I decided to pull over, I came to a small gravel pull-off. I took it and rolled into a parking lot in front of a dilapidated steel building. The kind of building you’d throw together if you were setting up an auto-body, or a metalworking shop. An ancient *For Lease* sign hung over a steel door placed awkwardly off-center of the road-facing side of the building. 

The parking lot was empty. I slowly drove down the gravel strip that wound around to the back. The small turn-around area behind the building held a stack of rotting pallets and a truck tire. Behind the turn-around area was an ugly field of mud, clumps of grass gone to seed, and scrubby trees. The half-inch-or-so of snow that had fallen so far failed to cover the grass and sticks. The back of the building was as blank as the front and the side, with nothing but a large garage door held closed with a hasp and a padlock.

I got out of my truck and rooted around in the bed for my bolt cutters. Without thinking about it too much, I opened the cutters and closed them on the shackle of the lock. The lock was a good one, and I had to work hard to get the cutters through it. The effort re-opened the abrasions on my knuckles, and I once again had blood on my hands.

I had the momentary thought: *Why am I breaking into this building?* At that point though, I didn’t really know why I had done anything. Why had I flown into a rage this morning? Why did I hit Casey? Why did I drive aimlessly for three hours? I guess I was just getting used to just doing stuff for no reason. I said “Whatever” to myself and kept working on the lock.

The lock finally gave way. I worked it out of the hasp and chucked it into the field. I looked around to make sure nobody was watching me - the coast was clear - and lifted the garage door. 

The interior of the building was dark, and I could only see a few feet inside. Next to the door I just opened were shelves full of … stuff. Piles of old junk. My eyes landed on the shelf closest to the door, where an old garden hose, tangled up with an extension cord had been heaped on top of more junk. *Could I hang myself with the hose, or the cord?* The thought just sort-of popped into my mind. An intrusive thought, isn’t that what they call it? Dark thoughts that just show up, unwanted. Everyone gets those, right?

Instead of dismissing the idea of hanging myself as just some kind of meaningless brain-noise, I welcomed it into my mind. I imagined trying to fashion a noose, or some kind of slip-knot with the rubber hose or the electric cord. Would it slip around my neck and choke me properly when I put my full weight on it? Would it be strong enough to hold me, assuming I could attach it to a roof beam? *Probably wouldn’t work*, I finally decided. If I’m going to go that route, I’ll need something that’s guaranteed to work, and to work fast.

“Whatever.”

There was enough room immediately inside the garage door to fit my truck. I carefully pulled into the building, then shut the garage door behind me. Inside was cold and dark. It wasn’t pitch black, like in a cave. A little bit of daylight broke in through a few gaps in the corrugated metal walls and roof. The inside had the feel of a basement with the door at the top of the stairs open. Dim, but you can still see.

I decided to stay inside this ruined building for a while. Maybe the cold and darkness were what appealed to me. Eventually, I assumed, the cops will find me, and they’ll lock me up in a place that’s well lit and warm. That will be too comfortable. I need to be treated in ways that are cruel and unusual. I’ve always been a DIY kind of guy. I’ll roll my own self-punishment, thank-you-very-much.

I sat down on the concrete floor next to my truck and stayed there for a few hours. My thoughts drifted around, but always came back to what I did to Casey that morning. I was searching for some excuse for behaving like I did. Some point of view where I was at least a little-bit justified in losing my shit in the driveway. Some reason why I should be given a little slack. But I came up with nothing. She was screaming at me. I was screaming at her. Then I hit her. Screaming then hitting. That’s me. That’s who I am. 

My phone buzzed, startling me. I didn’t want to even think about who it could be - the police calling me to “ask me some questions?” Maybe it’s Casey calling to tell me how bad I hurt her. I closed my eyes and picked up the phone - I didn’t want to know who was calling. My fingers found the power button and turned the phone off. Problem solved. For now.

I finally got bored with dwelling on my violent, thoughtless act. I got bored with punching the floor out of despair and smacking the back of my head against the truck. 

“Whatever,” I sighed.

I got up and looked about the inside of the building I had designated as my DIY prison.

The place was like an indoor junkyard. Stuff was piled on ancient metal shelves and more stuff was arranged in precarious heaps on the floor. I saw an old outboard motor, a drill press, a reel-to-reel tape player, an air compressor, a tent, a vacuum cleaner, a clock-radio, a bent-to-hell dog crate, a manual typewriter, a busted chair, a refrigerator, a ceiling fan with a missing blade. There was no organization to it. No clear categories or reasons for it being here. I don’t think I ever saw two of the same kind of item.

Everything was old. Ancient. Like from the 1970s or earlier. The vacuum cleaner had a sticker on it that said it was purchased at Two Guys - that store went out of business a loooong time ago. Some of the junk was even older than that. The oven had a “Caloric” logo on it. That brand went extinct with the dinosaurs.

The only other thing the stuff had in common, besides being old, was that it was all broken. Everything had obvious physical damage. Key caps busted off the typewriter, broken tent poles, bent propeller on the outboard. 

I found the john during my “tour of the facility.” Surprisingly the toilet (a very ancient industrial model) flushed and cold water came from the tap in the sink. With a supply of water and a working toilet, my dumb idea of long-term self-isolation in this strange building started to look actually doable. 

I still had groceries in the back of the truck from my morning Costco run. I never even got them in the house because of what happened - because of what I did - in the driveway. I got back from Costco. Casey and I argued. The neighbors came out to watch. At least two of them were videoing us. I hit Casey. Then I punched the side of my truck a few times. Then I sped away. Now I’m here.

I looked in my truck’s bed. The stuff from Costco was scattered around because of the way I had been driving and was wet from the snow. The tortilla chips were a little crushed but the cans and jars looked okay.

I was hungry, but just looking at the groceries gave new life to the agonizing feeling of guilt and shame. I decided not to eat. Not for a while. I wanted to stay cold and hungry in the dark. Knowing that I was inflicting some level of suffering on myself actually helped my emotional state.

The sun went down and the interior of the building got for-real dark, not just dim. And it got even colder. I fumbled around until I found the broken tent I spotted earlier, and set it up as well as I could next to my truck. With two of its three poles broken, the tent was a derpy mess. I found an old ratty tarp under a pile of broken office chairs. I crawled into the tent, wrapped myself in the tarp, and somehow managed to fall asleep.

When I woke up, there was a dim light behind the crumpled canvas of the broken tent. There was a moment - a second? A tenth of a second, maybe, where what happened yesterday - what I *did* yesterday - hadn’t bubbled up into my brain. I was in a tent. I was content. Then I remembered. I remembered the argument in the driveway. I remembered how Casey fell when I hit her. I remembered the *sound* of my fist hitting her face. The guilt, the sickening anxiety and shame flooded back. I crawled out of the tent and threw up.

The indoor junkyard was again dimly lit by a few shafts of light from the building’s bent and corrosion-ridden walls and roof. I sat on the floor for a while. An hour, maybe. Then I got up and used the john.

After I grabbed a few handfuls of water from the faucet, I headed back to my truck. On the way back I found The Machine. I didn’t see it yesterday even though I carefully looked around the whole place. I probably missed it because it was so big, it was easy to mistake for a wall. 

The Machine sat in the center of the building, it was ten or twelve feet tall and as long as a bus. It was a boxy, steel-paneled enclosure with a door on one end that looked like it belonged in a submarine - racetrack-shaped, with a huge handle that operated a nine-pin locking mechanism like you’d see on a bank vault. The door had a nice round window made of super-thick, super-tinted glass, like a port-hole made out of the glass in a welding helmet.

What was this giant thing? Any guess I had was as good as another. An industrial sausage-making machine? Something NASA built as part of the moon missions? Like everything else in here, it looked old. Like everything else, it was busted. A control panel full of buttons, switches, and lights hung off the side like it had been ripped out of the machine. One of the steel panels on the side opposite the door was bent out, as if some heavy and fast-moving part inside got loose and flew into the steel enclosure.

I walked back to the truck. I was starving and I absent-mindedly tore open the bag of tortilla chips and shoved huge handfuls into my mouth. Then I remembered that last night I had decided not to eat. I wanted to remain cold and hungry, to punish myself for what I did. Now it was too late. Like a dumbass, I had just shoved food in my mouth without thinking. Actions without thinking - my signature move. Like hitting Casey.

I punched the side of my truck again. Five times with my right hand. There was some blood on my knuckle. I hit the truck five more times. Five more after that. And five more. Now my hand hurt. Blood ran down my middle finger. Did my hand hurt as much as Casey hurt when I hit her? 

I loved that truck. Saved for a year to buy it. I kept it clean and well maintained. This morning, though, when I looked at the truck, I saw *me*. This thing that absorbed so much of my energy and attention somehow represented me. It had to go.

I stomped back into the depths of the building and rooted around for tools. I found a bent screwdriver, a socket set that looked like it went through world-war-one about fifty times, a rusting crowbar, and a claw hammer with a broken-off claw. I brought them back to the truck. Then I smashed the driver’s window with the hammer. I broke all the glass on the vehicle. The windows, the windshield. The headlights. Everything. I used the crowbar to pry off every body panel that I could. I unscrewed every screw that I saw. I took out the seats. Disassembled everything under the hood.

I spent hours taking the thing apart. A few hours before sunset I shoved the rest of the bag of tortilla chips into my mouth to give me the energy to keep at it. I was determined to break the truck down its smallest parts. 

The task of destruction took me two days. Two days of prying, smashing, loosening, cursing, and kicking to take that thing apart. But I did it. I completely dismantled my truck. I stacked the parts neatly in a corner of the building. Maybe someone could use them one day. But there was no way in hell that person was going to be me. I had decided that I was never leaving this building. This dark and cold place, full of things that were old and broken, would be the last place I ever saw.

I began my fourth day in the dark and cold building by eating a can of Costco black beans using the bent screwdriver as a utensil. The pile of parts that used to be my truck leaned against the wall next to the garage door. With only a few lousy broken tools, I had to use my body a lot during the truck-breakdown project. My hands, knees, arms, and shins were scratched and bruised from the effort. But the minor injuries were a small thing. Overall, destroying my truck had been therapeutic. That truck had been a decent-sized chunk of my identity. Now that it was a pile of parts, it was like part of me was gone. 

*You don’t need to drive a truck to be a real man.*

Another intrusive thought. It popped into my head completely uninvited. The idea sounded familiar. Like a rant against toxic masculinity I’d see on social media. “A real man doesn’t need to bla bla bla.” Lots of ideas circulating out there about what a real man does or doesn’t do.

Somewhere, I like to imagine, someone is keeping the official master list of “what a real man does.” I don’t pretend to know everything on that list, and which stuff is more manly than the other stuff. I can take a pretty good guess at some of it, though. Making a ton of money - providing - that’s got to be near the top of the list. I sure as hell don’t check that box. I haven’t even had a job for nine months.

Being a protector. That’s gotta be on the list. A man protects his family. 

*POW! Right in the kisser!*

Another intrusive thought. That’s exactly what I did to Casey. Roundhouse to her jaw. In my mind’s eye, I remembered how she fell after I punched her. I threw the half-eaten can of beans against the wall, again too disgusted with myself and what I did to eat.

I returned to thinking about the list of what makes a guy a “real” man. Being a good father? I’m sure that’s on the list too. Fatherhood is something else I fail hard on also. Jessica doesn’t even look at me anymore when she comes home from school. Some days, she even tries to sneak past me to get to her room.

Objectively, I have almost no value as a man. As a human. *Almost.* There’s one thing I’m good at. I don’t know if it’s on that magic list of stuff you need to do to be a “real” man, but what I’m good at is *tinkering*. Fiddling with stuff, figuring it out, and getting it to work. I’m shit at everything else. But give me a busted lawnmower, and I will get that thing working again. Guaranteed.

I took a break from thinking about how bad I was at being a decent human and looked around the place again. This weird old building was starting to feel familiar and comfortable. All the old, broken, and worn-out things started to feel like my friends. I was amongst my people!

I examined the old Caloric oven. I checked out a snowblower that had to have been from the early 1950s. I picked up an Electrolux vacuum, then gently put it back on the shelf. Straightened a pair of rabbit-ear antennas on a TV whose cathode ray tube was missing. Then I came to The Machine.

It was a dark green box about thirty feet long and ten feet wide. I knocked on the side and heard the satisfying, deep boom you get when you bang on sheet metal. The controls - a box full of chunky switches and buttons - was hanging on only by the cable harness. The submarine-hatch-bank-vault door was on one of the ends. On the other end was a three-foot-square metal plate held in with screws. Some kind of access panel, I guessed.

The control panel had no markings. No labels on the switches and buttons. I walked around the thing again. There were no labels or signs or stickers or anything that hinted at what The Machine was.

I cupped my hands and tried to peer through the darkened glass window on the hatch, but couldn’t see anything. I grabbed the thick metal door lever and got ready to give it a good tug. Then I let go. I stepped back. Something was wrong. I suddenly had a “stranger danger” sort of feeling. The Machine was different. Different than anything else in here. Different than anything else *anywhere*, maybe.

I thought for a minute. My fear was one of those “gut feelings.” The feeling you get when your subconscious mind knows something isn’t right, but can’t figure out exactly what it is. 

What was my lizard brain seeing that my conscious mind didn’t realize? The hatch was definitely weird. Why make such a strong door, with a bank-vault-style locking system on the *outside*? Why weren’t there any labels on the control panel? Why wasn’t there some kind of power input to this machine? Or ventilation panels? Why didn’t I notice The Machine the other day, when I first got here and looked around?

“Whatever.”

I grabbed the door handle and pulled. The nine locking pins slid inwards with a satisfying series of clanks. The door opened with a squeal. 

Inside was a dark chamber. I poked my head in. The space inside the door was a perfect cube. The metal walls, floor and ceiling were totally blank - the same dark-green-painted steel as the exterior of the machine. Something small sat in the center of the floor. I stepped in and looked closer. It was an ancient Mr. Coffee brand coffee maker. I picked it up and carried it outside of the dark chamber to look at it closer. It was just a regular coffee maker. The hot plate was grimy. The plastic part that holds the coffee grounds was cracked. There was a scorch mark next to the power switch. Just another old, broken thing. 

I carried the coffee maker to the nearest shelf and gingerly put it down next to a broken lamp. “Here you go, little dude,” I said to the Mr. Coffee. “You can hang out with your buddies now.”

I turned back to The Machine. “And you,” I said. “Whatever you are, I’m going to fix you.”

I unscrewed the access panel with the same screwdriver I used to take apart my truck and to eat my beans. The side of The Machine opposite the cube-shaped chamber was filled with gears, shafts, motors and linkages. Clearly, the “doing stuff” part of The Machine was behind the access panel, and the “gets stuff done to it” part was the chamber where I found the Mr. Coffee. What stuff was it doing? What stuff was it supposed to do it to? I still had no clue.

I rummaged around the building and found a few old, cracked mirrors. I carefully arranged them to reflect one of the shafts of sunlight from a hole in the roof into The Machine. I collected the tools I used to take apart my truck, and got started.

I didn’t know what The Machine was when I started, and, frankly, I didn’t learn anything from crawling around the innards, trying to patch it up. Inside were things that were probably motors. One of them had a magnet so strong I needed both hands to pry the screwdriver off it when it got stuck. A lot of the mechanism functioned as a gearbox, allowing a gizmo that reminded me of an old-fashioned mechanical cash register to adjust the rotational speed of a collection of coils and shiny metal parts. 

Even with zero knowledge of The Machine’s function, it wasn’t too hard to see what was broken. A large flywheel had been mounted on the end of a shaft. The shaft was bent and the flywheel, which weighed about fifty pounds, must have been flung off into the wall when the shaft was spinning. I found the flywheel on the floor of the mechanical space, underneath a huge dent in the steel wall that was shaped exactly like the metal wheel.

I’m pretty proud of the way I came up with fixing that shaft. I cut out the bend in the shaft with a hacksaw I found, and managed to swap in parts of my truck’s drivetrain. I fashioned a sleeve to hold the thing together from metal I cut out of my truck bed. Let’s just say it was brilliant. It took me three days.

I had a lot of emotional ups-and-downs during those three days. Sometimes I thought that I wouldn’t be able to fix it. That I’d fail at the one damn thing that I allowed myself to think I was good at. Sometimes I got mad. Here I was, working like hell to fix this thing *for no reason*. Just because. How come nobody ever tried to fix *me*? Wouldn’t that be great, if someone decided to try to fix me, just because? Not because they had to, or because there’d be some benefit for them later.

After I was satisfied that the flywheel was mounted securely with the sleeve and fasteners that I rigged from truck parts, I took a look at the control panel. The cable harness had been treated pretty roughly and the connections to a bunch of the switches had been torn loose. I carefully re-attached the wires, making educated guesses about which ones connected to which switches. When everything looked good, I bolted the control panel back to the side.

I opened another can of beans and slowly shoveled them into my mouth with my screwdriver as I contemplated my handiwork. Was I done? Did I manage to fix it? Since I still didn’t know what The Machine did, deciding if my fix was any good was going to be tricky.

I walked around it again. Maybe I was missing some detail, some clue, that would unravel the mystery of this thing. I opened the hatch and stepped into the cube-shaped chamber where I found the Mr. Coffee. I sat on the floor and slowly ate beans. Maybe I would have some inspiration or brilliant insight into the nature of The Machine if I sat inside it for a while.

A sound came from behind me. A clacking, whirring noise like you hear from old-fashioned typewriters. *Or cash registers*. I left the beans on the floor and jumped out of the chamber. I sprinted around the side and stopped short at the control panel. One of the buttons was lit up.

There were three buttons - the chunky square kind that have little lamps inside of them. The kind of buttons you push and they toggle in and out with a really nice “chick” sound. The first button was lit up with a yellow light.

The clacking sound continued - it came from the “doing stuff” side of the machine, where I had spent most of the last three days fixing the flywheel. I walked around and looked inside. Stuff was moving! My flywheel was spinning about at 500 RPM - faster than I thought it would go. But my fix was holding. There wasn’t any vibration or noise coming from the shaft. The cash-register-looking thing was clacking away, like it was totaling up a huge shopping receipt in like, Macy’s in, like, 1930 or something.

I screwed the steel access panel back in. It seemed like the safe thing to do. If the flywheel or another fast-moving part got loose, I’d prefer it to not shoot out of the back of the thing. Then I walked back to the control panel. I got the same stranger-danger feeling that I had when I first examined The Machine. It was stronger this time. My heart was racing. I had a strong, sick feeling in my gut.

*Power*. What the hell is powering it?

I basically lived inside of this thing for the last three days. I didn’t see anything. At. All. that looked like a source of power. No high-voltage input. No batteries. Nothing that looked like a capacitor. I didn’t see any mechanical inputs either - no pulleys or shafts to connect to an outside source of mechanical energy. So, what’s it running on? The beans I left in the chamber?

The yellow button on the control panel started blinking as if it was saying: Push me. Push me. Push me…

I pushed it.

The mechanical sounds increased in frequency and volume. Whatever The Machine is doing, pushing the button made it do it faster. A light-blue lamp in the second button started flashing. I pushed it.

The sounds coming from The Machine changed again. They got soft, then loud, then soft again. Like the thing was throbbing. A super-high-pitched whine sounded. But it wasn’t coming from the mechanical side of the machine. I held my ears and walked to the hatch. Even though I was holding my ears, the sound was horrible. Hot air poured out of the cube-shaped chamber. My half-eaten can of beans was still in the center of the floor. I closed the door with my foot and the high-pitched squeal was attenuated to the point where it was bearable. I heaved on the lever and the door locked.

I walked back to the control panel. The third button lit up with a blinking orange light.

“Whatever.” I pushed the third button.

Nothing happened. I waited. Still nothing. Ten more seconds. Then a bell from somewhere inside the machine gave a quiet “ding.” The high-pitched whine immediately ceased. The clacking from the mechanical side of the thing stopped too. The lights on the control panel went dark. All I heard was the sound of the machinery slowly spinning down, like a washing machine after the spin cycle stops.

I waited for it to fully spin down, then opened the hatch. The beans were gone. In their place was a tiny, gold-colored object. I checked to make sure the walls of the chamber weren’t hot - they weren’t. And stepped in to examine the thing on the floor. It was an old-fashioned wind-up alarm clock. One of the little legs was broken off, the glass face was cracked and the minute hand was bent a bit. It was another old and broken thing. Like the Mr. Coffee. Like everything in this place. Where was the can of beans? Did the beans get turned into a broken alarm clock?

The sun was going down and the building was becoming for-real dark. I made my way back to the derpy tent and crawled in. I couldn’t sleep. What happened to the beans? What is The Machine? What is this place?

Sometime before dawn I came up with a theory. All the old, broken stuff in this place came from The Machine. Everything in here started as something else - something that wasn’t a broken household appliance. The alarm clock started as a half-eaten can of beans. What was the Mr. Coffee before it was transformed by the machine? What about this tent? Or the oven? 

It’s just a guess, but I think that everything in here started as something alive. The beans, for example, used to be part of a plant. Maybe the Mr. Coffee, and the snowblower, and everything else started out as a person. A human who entered the machine and came out as a busted old thing.

Based on that theory, I came up with a plan. When I first got here, and saw the old garden hose on the shelf, my first thought was whether or not I could use it to hang myself. I’m really glad I didn’t, because then I wouldn’t have had a chance to fix The Machine. Now I can use The Machine to make someone fix me. I’m going to put myself in the machine. If I’m right about how it works, it’ll turn me into a broken lawnmower or blender or something. One day, if I’m lucky, someone will find me here. They’ll say “Oh, look at this. I can fix this - a little penetrating oil, a fresh coat of paint, and it’ll be good!” 

Here’s how I’m going to do it: I’m going to start up The Machine by sitting in the chamber, like I did when I was eating the beans. Then I’ll run out, push the three buttons, and run back into the chamber before the bell dings. Is the plan foolproof? No. Is it safe? Probably not. Is it a good idea? I don’t know, but I’m doing it anyway.

There was just one last thing I needed to do - writing down what happened to me and posting it here. 

I crawled out of the tent and found my phone where I left it on top of the pile of truck parts. I turned it off when I arrived, so the battery should still be good. I turned it back on. It booted itself, then found the cell tower. I had so many notifications and missed calls that the thing vibrated for about five whole minutes after it powered up. Fifty-five missed calls. Forty voice mails. Ninety seven texts. Every single app I have that lets you send messages had a red bubble on the icon with two or three-digit notification counts. 

I dismissed all the notifications without checking any of them. I’m sure they were all horrible things - people telling me that they heard what I did, and that they were never going to speak to me again. The cops asking me to come to the station. Probably somewhere in that mess of messages was Casey telling me she’s divorcing me. Whatever people were trying to say to me, it doesn’t matter now. I’m going to be a friggin’ lawnmower!

I wrote down everything that happened and posted it here - in this forum where nobody knows me. If Casey or anyone ever wants to find out what happened to me, maybe they’ll find my story here. But I just want to fade away. I want to disappear from the minds and memories of everyone I ever knew. But before I go, I want to say this: if you come across something old and broken at a flea market or antique store or someone’s attic, it might be me. Think about taking it home and fixing it up. That’s what I’d want.

1qli6ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huel/comments/1qli6ac/first_month_on_huel_product_reviews/,First month on Huel - product reviews,"Used Huel for a little new years reboot with 1 shake and 1 Hot&Savoury meal per day. As I took advantage of the Huel Black selection box and the pasta&grains and noodle selection boxes for the hit meals, I can give my review for every flavour! These will be the UK versions and I am going into this wanting to like the products and looking for positives. 

One note is I find it really disappointing that the packaging is not recyclable. Hope this is fixed in future. 

*Huel Black*

Found early on that 500ml + powder shook and chilled overnight, topped up with 200ml and shook again gave the best texture and made the shake more satisfying, this was my shake method. 

*Strawberry & cream* - I typically do not like strawberry flavoured things but this was not disgusting. Not too sweet and didn't have too weird of an aftertaste. Subtle flavour but not bland. I don't dread the idea of drinking it again but it maybe wouldn't be my first choice. 

*Salted Caramel* - was pleasantly surprised that this was also not too sweet and didn't have much of an aftertaste. Another one that was subtle in the flavour but in a good way. 

*Cinnamon Swirl* - Oh baby. Perfect amount of cinnamon, right level of sweetness, has a creamy taste and that nice warm cinnamon aftertaste. It almost even has that slightly yeasty flavour you get with baked goods. Could genuinely drink this for pleasure. 

*Vanilla* - first impression was that it had a chemically aftertaste but that could be because I had it as I was cleaning my apartment. It's fine. It isn't too heavily flavoured so it doesn't cross into gross territory. It's what you expect of a vanilla flavour. 

*Banana* - I don't like banana flavoured anything. This was never going to be my first choice. I found this to be chalky and the aftertaste was foul but that's just my experience of all banana flavoured stuff. It does get better as I complete the serving. Wouldn't pick it but don't hate it. 

*Cookies and Cream* - I expected this to be very sweet but was encouraged by the powder having more of a biscuit smell. It is not massively sweet but it also doesn't taste like much else either? It's not unpleasant but it's very plain. 

*Coffee Caramel* - fairly decent coffee flavour. Tastes a bit like a not very sweet coffee cake (in a good way) . Not bad. 

*Chocolate* - not mega sweet, not super strong but not super bland. The right kind of flavour balance so it's easy to drink without being too much. It's alright. 

My picks for future orders: Cinnamon Swirl, Salted Caramel and Coffee Caramel.

*Hot&Savoury*

For the hot meals the technique I developed was:  add water, stir, leave for 10 minutes, add extra water, stir, microwave for 1 minute. This way it wasn't mush, but didn't have crunchy underdone grains/pasta/noodles either. 

*Mac and Cheeze* - Nice on its own and reasonably satisfying. Taste a bit like powdery potato but given a cheesier flavour with a bit of dijon mustard stirred in. Enjoyable with some hot sauce on top also. 

*Korean BBQ noodles* - meh, though I appreciated the smokey flavour. Improved with some gochujang and/or hot sauce. 

*Mexican Chilli* - nice smokiness and decent chilli kick but not mad spicy. Has a bit of a bitter taste as if the chilli caught on the bottom of the pan. For some reason my second packet tasted total ass. I'm sure I had this before and it was better? 

*Firery chick'n noodles* - actually, make-your-nose-run, spicy but still flavourful rather than just being hot to hide blandness. Little bit tomatoey, little bit creamy, that nice savoury aftertaste. I'm a little spice lover so I liked this. If I was allowing myself any cheese, this would be banging with some cheese on top or mixed in (even vegan cheese if you are so inclined). Some people on here can't stand the beany chunks but I've bought these kinds of chunks separately to use in home cooking so they don't bother me in the slightest.

*Thai green curry* - flavourful with a warming level of spice. Wasn't sure at first but really not bad. 

*Pasta Bolognese* - This has a bitter aftertaste. While in the chilli that went with the smokey flavour and was okay alongside the slight spiciness, this is bad and overpowering. I think Huel are adding a flavouring to this and the chilli which might be aiming to give beef but instead just tastes burnt. It seems to be  the sun-dried tomato flavouring. It's awful. This is so bad I wanted to throw out the other servings I have, but I persevered because I won't waste food. Adding a bit of balsamic vinegar makes this edible. Huel, please sort this out it's fucking terrible and so easy to fix. 

*Madras* - I have had this previously but I swear I remember it being spicier. This version is hot but in a nice warming way, tasty and filling. This also has that bitter taste in it but in the background, like the chilli so it's still edible. Honestly the pasta bolognese is so bad it's dropped the bar down to ""is it edible? Do I hate it?"". To which the answer is yes this is edible and no I don't hate it. 

*Cajun Pasta* - nicely flavoured, warm rather than hot on the spice level. Texture is whack, so some reason I couldn't get this to not be vaguely powdery. 

*Katsu Curry Noodles* - quite bland but not terrible. 

*Hoisin 'Duck' Noodles* - smells fantastic but taste is just alright. Not bad, not amazing. Edible. 

*Chick'n & Mushroom* - alright. Nice mushroom flavour. A bit in the bland side but fine overall. 

Would I but the Hot and Savoury meals again? Eh maybe as lazy lunches or of I was going camping with only a stove top kettle. I don't think I'd ever try having them as an evening meal again. I think the pastas are better than the noodles overall. I'd have the mac and cheeze and cajun pasta again in a pinch but everything else was either bland or just outright bad. 

Will I carry on with this? No. 
The shakes I could probably have for a quick replacement when I'm, say, doing a day at the ice rink and want to fuel up during the resurfacing. The hot meals could be alright for a quick lunch if I'm feeling super lazy. I wouldn't do another month of this being my main food source. This did do what I wanted though, in that it made me less food focused and less driven to overeat. ",4,1769245186.0,Huel,0,1.0,False

I'm looking for a coffee machine that will last years. I mostly drink 1–2 cups a day and want something simple, low-maintenance and made of quality materials (no cheap plastic).

Single serve preferred, but open to compromises. Price isn’t the main concern, however longevity and reliability are.

1qli5am,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qli5am/the_catman_at_the_bottom_of_my_stairs/,The catman at the bottom of my stairs,"&#x200B;

It was a little over a month ago when he first showed up. It was the dead of night and I awoke to a distant rattling coming from somewhere in my house.

As I entered the dark kitchen, still half asleep and wiping at my eyes, I noticed the cat flap snapping open and shut. It must've been Silver, my cat. Perhaps she'd had lost the magnet to her collar again. It had happened before and boy did she make herself known if anything changed in our predictable little lives. 

But no, as I bent down to beckon Silver into the kitchen, I peered through the hole and saw a pair of dirty, bare feet. 

The cat flap slammed shut and I scuttled backwards. My heart raced in my chest. Beyond the door's frosted glass, a shape formed. A face pressed upon the glass then withdrew leaving a wet smear. 

Something brushed against my leg. I startled, scrambled away, and turned to see Silver strutting in the moonlight. She hesitated, then nuzzled against me.

I looked back to the door and the thing was gone. 

At the time, I stupidly thought it was a mistake. Perhaps whoever it was had been a drunk and had arrived at my house thinking it was his own. That was, unfortunately, wishful thinking.

Then, one night, things got worse.

Once again, I was awoke at an ungodly hour. This time, it was to the sound of my cat mewing. She was making unfamiliar noises. They were shrill, clipped, insistent.

I threw off the covers and got out of bed. I had spoilt that cat. I’d forgotten to order her usual brand of cat food and had to pick up some less-than-premium stuff on the way home from work. I could imagine her circling the untouched food in her bowl, waiting for me to appear and deliver her complaints to the chef. My Silver was a very particular little girl.

After wrapping myself in my gown and trudging downstairs, I followed the mews to my kitchen. 

It was dark, yet I could see something moving near the back door. 

Another clipped meow came out from the darkness.

“Alright, alright,” I said to the shadows around me, rolling my eyes in the process. “I think there’s a tin of tuna in the fridge. I was \*planning\* to use it for lunch tomorr...”

I opened the fridge, bathing the room in a cold, bluish glow.

A pale face stared up at me from the floor. It was him. He had managed to get inside. 

Large, dark eyes and a slack jaw expression. A fat, bluish tongue hanging out the side of his open maw. His cheeks were puckered with grotesque pockmarks as though he had been attacked by a swarm of bees. The ears were simply two dangling lengths of torn flesh atop his head. Instead of a nose at its centre, his face pinched into a small, pinkish, wet nub. Patches of wiry black hair sprouted from his face, his neck, his back and chest. All visible skin was milky, smooth scar tissue which shone in the dim light.

I stepped back, dropping the tuna and knocking some of the contents out my fridge. My mind was whirring, trying to work out what was happening. The man–if it could be described as such–had somehow squeezed his head, shoulders and upper torso through the cat flap. Overly long arms stretched out into my kitchen; its hands clawing at the floor as he tried to drag himself across the tiles and work his waist through the gap.  

 

“Get back!” I shouted, grabbing out at the first thing within arm’s reach and then wielding it like a weapon. 

To my dismay, I’d picked up a can opener and wasn’t winning any duels anytime soon. Though, it was metal and had a bit of weight to it. So I figured I could at least throw it at the fucker if all else failed.

The thing groped at the floor. Its long, bony fingers walking along the tiles toward me. It let out a loud shrieking mew which sent a shiver through me. Then, it heaved again, finally contorting its waist through that impossibly small cat flap in the door. The rest of its body fell into the kitchen and, for a moment, it just laid there, swallowing deep chugs of air. Its back rising and falling with each wheezing breath.

Suddenly, it rose up on all fours, head swaying like a pendulum upon its neck. That tongue dangling like a thick cut of uncooked meat. Then, it scuttled over to Silver’s cat bowl. Its limbs moving with surprising grace despite their spindly appearance.

I staggered back and wildly threw the can opener in its direction, not wanting the damned thing to come any closer. My effort was fruitless; my makeshift weapon missed and bounced off into an empty corner of the room. 

The thing looked at me, fixed me with those large, dark eyes. Then, with a low purr, lowered its face to Silver’s bowl. Its tongue slowly lapped at her food. 

I screamed and grabbed at anything I could find with some heft to it. Flailing my arms around, I threw all kinds of shit in its direction. Cups, plates, utensils, a bread bin. A couple of things hit it and  made it recoil, hissing. Its mouth twisted into a hideous shape as it made the noise. Then, I clocked it with a well placed shot using a bottle of wine.  

It let out a bizarre scream, which sounded a little like roaring static. So loud it buzzed through my chest. 

It backed away, limbs twitching. Then, he twisted his body back through the cat flap in an effortless movement. By the time, I opened the back door, it had disappeared through a loose panel in my garden fence.

Catching a breath and ensuring it was gone, I poured myself a double bourbon and called the police. The operator seemed mildly frustrated and suspicious as I described the perpetrator. I offered very little. I wasn’t willing to have people think I was crazy, nor was I completely sure what I had seen. All I knew is that I was terrified and felt incredibly vulnerable in my home.

\###

“You know, I’d think about buying a dog if you’re that worried about security,” the locksmith said with a handful of screws pinched between his lips.

 

I didn’t answer. I just stood by the kitchen window, letting the morning sun warm my back as I watched him secure the last bolt on the new door. He rose up, then demonstrated how a door works by opening it and then shutting it again. He smiled, looking pretty proud of his work. 

“No way anyone can get through this one,” he said, tapping the door’s window with the tip of his screwdriver. “It’s a stubborn bastard. Everything from the panelling to the glass to the lock is reinforced.”

“Thanks,” I said, frowning at Silver’s cat bowl and trying to cast away all the memories of the night before. 

“I’m serious,” the locksmith went on, swiping his cup of coffee from the counter and taking a long swig, “no-one’s getting through that thing. Or your front door—that’s the same deal. Nope,”—he stood and admired his handy work—“you could nuke the entire neighbourhood and the only things left standing would be your doors.”

He laughed.

I smiled, then hid my face in my cup.

“Thanks,” I said again, trying not to sound so distant. 

I was grateful. Sure, getting an emergency locksmith first thing on a Sunday to install military grade doors cost a small fortune, but I was somewhat reassured that the problem was fixed. Though, despite this, I couldn’t shake a heavy sense of dread that churned deep in my guts. A fear crawling about within me.

\*Would that thing find another way in?\*

Later that day, a police officer with a face dominated by a huge, grey moustache visited my home in response to my report. 

“You see,” the moustache said, frowning at his notepad and blowing out a sigh, “without a better description of the guy, there’s not all else we can do to catch him.”

We were both sat in my living room, perched on opposite sofas. I watched small droplets of coffee fall from the officer’s face and onto his shirt after every sip. I wondered whether he had ever seen a thing dislocate every joint necessary to pull itself through a hole no wider than the palm of his hand. I pictured the way the officer’s moustache might bristle like a frightened animal if I described what I had really seen. What would he write in his notepad then? 

“It was dark,” I said, shrugging and simultaneously shutting down the conversation and likely the entire investigation. “I’m sorry. That’s all I have.”

The officer nodded slowly, then closed his notepad. 

“I see...” He then stood up and began packing his bag. “It looks like you’ve made a wise decision to improve the security of the house. Doors like that aren’t cheap.”

“What happens now?” I asked, following him to the front door.

“Well,” he said, putting on his coat and, after I had opened the door for him, stepping outside, “we start looking for the guy and, depending on our luck, we’ll keep you updated.”

“And if he comes back?”

“Call us immediately,” he said, pressing out a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Call us and we’ll come straight out. We’ve flagged the property.”

“Flagged?”

“It means a police may be dispatched more quickly to your address if you raise an alert.”

“Right, I guess that’s something.”

“Yep.” The moustache did one last inspection of the front door, then nodded with approval. “The wife wants one of these. Though I’m not completely convinced.”

I just shrugged, unsure whether the officer wanted my opinion. 

He nodded again, indicating that he did not, then turned towards the street and left. 

I watched him for a moment or two before he disappeared behind a line of parked cars, wondering if he considered his visit a complete waste of time.

\###

It’d been a week or so without incident and the heaviness against my heart had eased. Things had returned to normal around the house and a healthy dose of overtime at work had kept my mind focused on other matters. 

I drove home from work feeling...calm. Entering the house, I hung up my coat and turned on the hallway lights. I heard the movement on one of the sofas in the living room. Silver was stirring from her usual spot and probably eager to be fed. 

""Evening,"" I called out. ""Did you miss m--""

I looked up to see Silver sat at the top of the stairs. 

\*What was that noise from inside the living room?\*

Silence. 

Perhaps I was mistaken.

""Come,"" I called up to Silver. ""Let's get you some dinner.""

She just sat there, staring.

""Fine. I'll come to you then.""

I sighed, then went began climbing the stairs.

That's when I saw it.

I froze. 

A large dark mass coiled on my sofa. As if sensing that it was being watched, the things face rose up and looked at me.

For a moment, we stared at each other. Then, it scuttled towards me. It moved in a way no animal should. Limbs twisted and cracked with each bounding stride.

It was the wrong decision, but I ran towards Silver. Clambering up the stairs I could feel the thing swiping at my heels. Silver led the way and I followed her to my bedroom. The thing closing distance.

I slammed the door. I braced myself, expecting an impact. 

But nothing came.

Instead, I could hear it. Barely, over my beating heart and panting breaths, I could hear the damned thing gently scratching and pawing at the door. 

Then, after a beat of silence, I heard it let out a distorted mew.

\###

Now, I'm still sat up in my bedroom, with my duvet pulled up to my nose, and the police cackling down the phone. And I know he is still downstairs waiting for me. I hear him scapper around and mew. I hear him claw at my sofa and knock pillows onto the floor. 

I wonder what he is thinking, whether he simply wants a warm place to stay in the night or something more. 

I tried to escape, but found him sat at the bottom of the staircase. His head cocked and those wide, unblinking eyes held me in place. I returned to my room without any incident.

Though, I do not know what I fear the most. That thing or being locked alone with all this fear. Eyes locked on the door, I wonder when he will make his way up those stairs, enter my room and decide it is time to curl up at the bottom of my bed, nose at my toes and purr in the darkness, all night long.",5,1769245079.0,scarystories,2,1.0,False

I'm a 24 year old man and this is destroying my mental health.

  
Usually the timeline is something like this:

Workout->Eat, drink, feel good and chill for a couple hours->Crash hours later and nap for max 30 minutes, really tired->Head starts feeling foggy but restless at the same time, body starts to hurt and I feel really weird and wired->Can't fall asleep and when I do I repeatedly wake up throughout the night, sometimes jolting awake full of adrenaline feeling like dying->Next day I usually feel really awful but can sleep again at night and then am recovered.

  
The frustrating thing is that I have done everything. I have a whole wind down routine everynight where I do no screens, amber glasses etc 2 hours before bed, no food 4 hours before bed. Every morning I wear luminette glasses, I hydrate properly, I eat properly, I meditate daily, I do deep breathing, yoga and NSDR, no coffee 10 hours before bed. I pretty much try every single thing that could activate my parasympathetic nervous system but it just doesn't seem to matter...

  
The only thing that seems to help is not go as hard in the gym, because it's the only thing that causes it. But I wanna go hard, both for my mental health which it boosts in the moment and few hours after, and for the gains. This always happens when I overdid it but I have no clue where that line is because usually this happens like once a week and I train every other day. It happens on different muscle groups aswel. I already cut out intense cardio because this seemed to trigger it, but apparently just doing weights is enough to throw my system off too. I always train in the morning/early afternoons way before bedtime.

  
My current supplement stack is: Omega 3, L-Glutamine, Creatine, Magnesium Bisglycinate, L-Theanine, Zinc. Any help would be appreciated.",2,1769243723.0,HubermanLab,20,0.67,False

We first built it as a ""dinosaur landscape"" maybe 5 years ago by gluing cardboard together and painting a stream in the middle (more layers of cardboard on the side). Since its made for play paint came off and we added sand and stuff and gave it a new layer of paint.

The ""mountain"" in one corner lost its bark cliffs and after a while the whole piece was transformed into a winter landscape using white paint, glue and baking powder. We lost the river in the process. Polar Bears and Penguins and other Arctic and Antarctic plastic toys lived there.

Then it was back as a green board with lots of sand and coffee grounds as texture. Thats how its been the last year or more. Mostly as a ""dog yard"" since we built a bunch of agility scatter to go with it and our collection of small toy dogs.

But this winter the paint started coming off again, and what was supposed to be just a quick renovation project became a total overhaul with new riverside cliffs and the river returning. Up to 15 kids ages 3-5 have been involved in the process with a smaller core group of 4-5 year olds that took part more than once.

Materials is anything we had on hand. Paint (acrylis, water colous), different types of wrong glue for this kind of thing, coffee grounds, chia seeds, rice, small stones, pine cones, moss, bark, cardboard and paper.",12,1769243603.0,TerrainBuilding,0,1.0,False
1qlhqld,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qlhqld/which_endgame_grinder/,"Which ""endgame"" grinder?","Hey,

I'm looking to upgrade my grinder and am looking for a solution that makes me happy long-term.

For the last few years, I've been working with a Lagom P64 with different burrs (Mizen OM, SSP LS v2, SSP UMv1) using it for Espresso and Pourover. However, I started noticing that I prefer medium or even modern dark espresso while I love my pourover to be superlight. So, in December I bought a Lagom Casa for Espresso and now, I'm looking for a pourover grinder that can produce great cups. 

These days I drink >80% pourover, so I'm also willing to spend good money for the right grinder.

So, what coffees do I drink? Better known roasteries on my shelf are Sey, Prodigal, Coffee Collective, Datura, etc. - For really nice filter roasts I'm willing to spend up to \~150€/kilogram. I mostly go for washed coffees and sometimes clean naturals. Usually, I avoid coffees with higher processing.

What am I looking for in a cup? My highest priority high clarity with vivid acid (not astringent), but I also want the cup to be a bit sweet and juicy.

So, which grinders have I considered so far? I've been looking at various grinders, also in different price ranges:

For quite some time I thought that Bookoo Motto80 with ULF burrs could be the way to go. - Of course, we will still have to see how the Bookoo turns out, but the more I read about the ULF burrs, the less I'm convinced that it is the right burr for me. From description I would assume that it is kind of unforgiving and won't make for a juicy cup.

As a platform I've also considered Zerno Z2, which would be currently at my limit pricewise, but I like the aethetics and I just love handcrafted high quality things. Concerns about the ULF burrs are the same though.

I'm not sure if any of that will be better with a 98mm platform or 102 (Lagom 01) plus I'm not a huge fan of the Lagom 01 aethetic. I like the look of Mahlkönig EK43S but as far as I can tell it will only perform really well after some costly upgrades which will probably make it too expensive. I've also looked at the Titus Nautilus, but I think I won't like the workflow at that price point. 

Lately, I came across Coffee Chronicler's review of the Femobook A4Z and also read some posts on here, praising the grinder for its cup quality. The descriptions of its traits in the cup sound quite good to me and probably what I'm looking for. However, I have to admit that the grinder itself doesn't really excite me. To me the main downsides are: 1) I've no need for my grinder to be battery powered and it feels like quite the waste, since I have an electric outlet right next to my coffee station. 2) It's quite slow. 3) Its catchcup only has space for 30g of coffee. In the mornings, I brew one batch with 48g. 

I'm sure I'm overlooking some other great options, so I wanted to ask the community here for recommendations.

The first of these experiences occurred on the night of 10/12/2025 (NZDT).

I don't know where to start, but I'll start at the beginning, I guess.

I’m an 18 year old girl.

It's a Wednesday night, and I head to bed early, about 10:30pm, as I have a 6:00am start.

At about 11:30pm, I'm awakened to a constant slamming noise outside my bedroom window, and sounds of steps going up and down my hallway (I live with a Couple and their young Daughter)

Initially I ignore it, but there is still that slamming noise coming from outside. At this point I am annoyed, and head outside to see what's going on. What I see shocks me, on either side of my entranceway, all the leaves and branches have been cut down and assembled into neat piles, left and right, and there are several boxes with random indistinguishable things inside them, I remember one distinctively, as it was full of glass bottles, some of which had a weird wavy shape to them filled with a dirty water looking substance, also some green rectangular things with hard metal bits sticking out of them.

Having followed me outside, the daughter observes and says ""That's just my elder’s junk"". Confused, I go for a short walk to investigate anything in the neighbourhood, and come home 5 minutes later to the Father standing confused on the front lawn, I say to him, ""what happened to all the branches?"" He said ""it's dealt with"".

Upon entering the house, the daughter suddenly approaches me and said ""we can feed you, but you have to live outside"", ""We can look after you, but for now this is our home.

I say, ""I'm tired, let's talk about this tomorrow"".

The daughter says some things to encourage me to stay, (Such as, ""we can grow together and enhance, but you can't live with us inside”), I dismiss it, and continue to say ""We'll talk tomorrow""

The next morning, I wake up, and it's silent, I leave for work, and there are now only two boxes out the front, as l well as the two bald, empty bushes.

Nine hours later, I arrive home, and to my amazement both bushes have grown back like new, yet there were still two boxes remaining, I go inside to gather my thoughts and absorb what has happened.

Ten minutes later, I go outside.

And almost like I was never given a choice, I open one.

It's the box full of green junk and glass bottles.

Attached is a dusty old note, Saying “for you, my long-lost Son”.

 I never heard from the Couple or their daughter ever again.

I’m confused, and go and visit a friend of mine, she immediately says “who are you”?, I’m Stella, can we have a coffee? She looks at me weird, like Lazers cutting through ice, “I don’t know anyone called Stella.”

 

“I just saw you yesterday”

“I didn’t meet with anyone yesterday”

As a proud Bulgarian from Sofia, I look at our beautiful Balkans and can’t help but notice how Lake Ohrid — that UNESCO pearl — is sadly stuck with you. While Bulgaria has been steadily climbing the economic ladder (our GDP per capita is already more than double yours, around $22-24k vs your \~$9-10k), we see North Macedonia still struggling with stagnation, corruption, low wages, and endless EU delays.

So, inspired by the Americans’ cheeky Greenland idea, here’s a serious yet friendly offer from Bulgaria: We’ll buy Lake Ohrid from you for a very generous price — let’s say enough to give your economy a real boost, pay off some debts, and finally get your people out of poverty. With our funds and management, we’ll turn it into an even bigger tourist magnet, protect it properly from pollution, and make sure the rakija flows freely for everyone.

Think about it:

•  No more worrying about UNESCO threats or environmental scandals on your watch.

•  Your budget gets a massive injection while we handle the jewel of the Balkans like the responsible EU member we are.

•  We share the lake’s beauty anyway — why not let the richer, more stable neighbor take the reins and lift the whole region?

Of course, if you’re too attached to your little lake (and your endless excuses for why you’re still behind), just say no. But deep down, you know Bulgaria could do it so much better.

What do you say, Skopje? Ready to cash in and let the big boys handle the gem? 🇧🇬💰

Let’s discuss over a coffee — or better yet, over some Bulgarian yogurt and banitsa on our side of the border.

The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself.” Ezekiel 18:20 

My father was a good man. We were poor growing up, but he did the best he could, working odd jobs here and there to provide for mother and me. We did a lot of moving around when I was younger, lots of new towns, a new school every year or two. My mother used to say we moved so much because, “Daddy got a new better paying job.” in whatever town we would be moving to next. That was always the excuse but by the time I turned twelve, I had stopped believing the recurring lie. Despite dad’s “better job”, we never seemed to have much money. For most of my young life, we lived off the barest of means. In our home, a bologna sandwich was considered to be doing well. 

 I never really learned why we moved around so much. I always had the feeling dad was chasing something or maybe running from something. Unlike mom's usual excuse, dad would never answer when I would ask why we had to leave again; he usually wouldn't even look at me. He would come home from work one evening and loudly announce, “Time to go!” and mom and I would quickly pack up whatever shitty little apartment we happen to be staying in, and we would be on the road that later that night. 

That was my life for 14 years. Then one day I came home from school and dad's pickup was already home. We were staying in a rundown singlewide trailer house just outside of Joplin, Missouri. It was almost unheard of for dad to be home early on a weekday. I mean sure, there were times he would be laid off from wherever he was working at the time, but he would usually scramble to go job hunting that day, and he almost never took sick days. My concern grew as I approached the house and saw that the trucks driver's side door was standing open, and so was the front door to the house.  

I remember that walk, down the driveway to the house. The absolute silence of the world as my footsteps crunched over the gravel and dirt. The creak of each wooden step up to the small wobbly porch. The feel of the warm breeze that blew through the trailers open door, carrying with it a coppery smell. I saw mom first. I could see her through the open door, slumped down against the wall beside the couch; her knees pulled up to her chest. She was pale and wouldn't look at me, no matter how loud I called to her. She just stared straight ahead, shivering. After summoning up as much courage as I could, I stepped into the house and around the corner, and there was dad. At first, I couldn't understand what I was seeing, I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that this was really happening, that that was dad. He was on his back, on top of the dining room table. His head hung backwards off of the edge, at too sharp of an angle. His eyes rolled in their sockets before focusing on me for the briefest of moments. He tried to speak but all that came out was a sickening gurgle as blood poured from his lips and his throat... God his throat, it was gone. It was like it had been ripped away and flung across the room. Blood coated the walls and ceiling in thick dripping lines. I screamed and turned to mom, trying to shake her out of her shock or whatever was happening, but she just kept staring straight ahead, she never even acknowledged me. 

 I don't remember much after that, but they say I ran to a neighbor's house and got them to call 911. Dad was obviously dead when the ambulance and police arrived. They took mom to the hospital and tried to get her to tell them what she had seen, but I guess the shock was too deep. She wouldn’t speak; she stopped eating, stopped drinking and was eventually admitted to the psyche ward. For years, therapists tried to reach her, to help her to process and talk about what she had seen. Unfortunately, mom never spoke again.  

After the incident, I ended up moving in with my grandparents in El Paso. They had mom moved to an assisted living home an hour's drive from their house. We would go visit her two to three times a week for the first couple of years, hoping and praying that she would come back to us. But she never did. Occasionally she would whistle, but only ever one tune. Grandpa said the tune sounded familiar, but he could never place it; no one could. Eventually the visits became once a week, then every other week, once a month. By the time I was 18, I only saw mom a couple times a year for special occasions. I spent a lot of my free time in therapy, trying to deal with my trauma, but I had nightmares of my dad's face for years, still do sometimes. 

 My life with my grandparents was more comfortable than I could ever have imagined. I had good food, a warm bed every night, and I was finally in school long enough to make real, lasting friendships. And I struggled with the guilt that I was happier with my grandparents than I ever was with my parents.  

Now I'm a relatively happy, stable, and sane 35-year-old history teacher with a wife and a son of my own, despite the trauma I went through as a child. At least I thought I was sane. For the past couple weeks, I've been waking up in the middle of the night with my mother's whistle stuck in my head. On one particularly rough night, Grace told me it could be the manifestation of my guilt for not visiting mom in a while. It made sense, after all I hadn't gone to visit for the past two years. But to be honest, I didn’t feel much guilt. Maybe that made me an asshole, but I was pretty sure she didn’t even know who I was when I did visit. But, I was off work the next day, so I figured I had no excuse to not go for a visit.  

That morning, I filled my coffee cup, got Shawn off to preschool and headed for the Shady Grove care home. I still lived roughly an hour from the home, plenty of time to think on the drive. I thought about how things were when I was a kid, about mom and what she had seen... about dad. The look on his face as his loose neck swiveled toward me. What did he try to say? Who did that to him? What had mom seen? I realized my hand was shaking as I raised my coffee to my lips and did my best to clear my mind of the questions that would probably never be answered. I took a steadying breath and turned up the radio.  

Shady Grove was a very upscale assisted living home, one of the most celebrated in the state, if the banner in the lobby was to be believed.  

“Hi Susan.” I said as I approached the nurse's desk. 

The older woman with big poofy blonde hair looked up and studied me for a moment before recognition spread a smile on her face, “Jim, hi. Wow it's been a while.”  

I nodded, “Yeah well, I've been busy.” Clearing my throat I continued, “How is she?” 

Susan stood up and came around the desk shaking her head, “Oh you know her, she just sits quietly most of the time. Although some of the night staff say she has started whistling more at night lately. Come on, I'll take you to her.” 

“Really?” I asked as I followed, “How long has she been doing that for?” 

“Oh, just the past week or so.”  

That was one hell of a coincidence, I thought as we walked down the sterile white halls, the smell of soiled bed sheets, bleach, and stale body odor permeating the air. I hated this place, it felt like deaths waiting room.  

Finally, Susan brought me to a brightly lit reading room with large windows facing a garden outside. There she was, sitting slumped in her wheelchair. Her once dark brown hair now turned gray, hung down around her shoulders in tangles. I slowly walked across the room, picking up a white plastic chair on the way. Setting the chair next to her I sat down and looked her over.  

“Hey mom.” I said, touching her arm.  

She didn't look at me; she never did. Her vacant eyes stayed fixed forward. Lost in a moment, years ago.  

“Mom, it's Jim. Your son.”  

Still no reaction. I don't know why I always come here expecting anything else. I nodded, “It's okay mom, I'll just sit here with you for a while.” 

We sat and watched the butterflies in the garden for a while. Then I stood and just as I was about to leave, mom started to whistle. When I turned to look at her, I noticed something I hadn't seen before. Her eyes, while still mostly fixed straight forward, had more focus in them than I had seen in years. 

“Mom?” I asked. Bending down to her.  

She didn't answer just kept whistling and looking straight ahead, a single tear broke from her left eye and ran down her face. She was focused on something. I turned to see where she was looking. Out the window, across the garden, in a darkened upstairs window on the other side of the courtyard. At first, I thought I could see something, was it a person? I couldn't tell. But when I blinked, whatever I thought I saw was gone. 

I stopped another nurse as she passed, “Excuse me, could you tell me what's on the other side of the building there?” I asked as I pointed to the darkened window. 

“Oh, that's going to be the therapeutic wing when its finished, unfortunately the contractors are dragging their feet lately.” She answered. 

“So, it’s empty? Theres nothing or no one in there?” 

“Shouldn't be. Unless it was one of the workers.”  

I nodded and turned back to mom as she slowly stopped whistling and went back to her vacant stare. I looked back at the window again but there was nothing there. I sighed and bent down to kiss mom on the cheek. “Goodbye mom, I'll see you next time.” And with that I left Shady Grove. 

That night after dinner and putting Shawn to bed, I spoke with Grace about the visit with my mother while we washed the dishes. 

“Well, it sounds like not much has changed. Do you at least feel better after seeing her?” She asked. 

“I don't know, maybe. On the one hand it was good to see her, but...” I trailed off as I absently dried a plate. 

“But?” Prompted Grace. 

I shrugged, “But at the same time, she’s not her. Not the mother I grew up with. I keep waiting for her to snap out of it. Every time I visit, I walk in thinking maybe this time she will turn and just... speak, say something, say anything.”   

Grace put her hand on my shoulder, “I'm sorry.”  

“I know it's awful, but sometimes I wish that if she can't get better, she could just move on.” I turned to my wife. “Does that make me a monster?”  

She put down her towel and wrapped her arms around me, “No, honey. It just means you just want her to be free, whatever freedom looks like.”  

I smiled, “Sounds a lot nicer the way you say it.” 

Grace smiled back, “Well I'm a little nicer than you are.” 

We laughed and I leaned in and kissed her. And then Shawn started yelling.  

“Momma I had a bad dream!” He cried. 

Grace sighed and smiled up at me, “To be continued.” She said before turning and heading for Shawn’s room, leaving me to finish the dishes. 

 

I woke up again that night, it wasn't the whistling in my head though. You know how when you think you are alone, but then you slowly get that feeling crawling up your spine that someone somewhere is looking at you? It was like that. I sat up and looked around the room but saw only shadows. The clock on the nightstand showed 3:30AM. I lay back down and tried to get to sleep but I just tossed and turned. 

 After a while I decided to get up for a glass of water. I left my bedroom and walked down the hall past Shawns' room, his SpongeBob nightlight illuminating his room in a soft yellow glow. Down the stairs, through the front room, and into the kitchen. I downed one glass and was about to fill it again when I heard it. The whistle. Moms whistle. Only it wasn't in my head. It was on the other side of my front door.  

I froze listening to the whistle for a solid minute before it stopped. It was the exact same tune. I stepped through the house as if on autopilot and approached the front door. Was mom out there? Could she have gotten here? No, no she didn't even know where I lived. My heart was pounding as I looked through the peep hole. But, there was no one there. I pulled the curtain on the front room window aside and looked out but still, I saw nothing. Just the empty street, the neighbor's houses were all dark except for porch lights and the single streetlight on the corner. Was it just in my head? I wondered. Maybe I really was losing it.  

I went back to the kitchen and drank another half glass of water before walking back upstairs and past Shawns' room, Shawns' dark room. I stopped and walked back down the hall and into his room. I bent down next to the outlet, feeling around for the nightlight, thinking that maybe it had fallen. When I couldn't find it, I just shrugged and headed back to bed. Only when I got there, that's when I found the nightlight. It was sitting right there on my pillow. “What the hell?”  

I picked up the nightlight and looked it over, wondering how it had gotten there. I almost woke grace and asked her, but she had to perform surgery in the morning and needed her sleep. I took the nightlight and made my way back down the hall to Shawn’s room to plug it in. If he woke up without it, he would not be getting back to sleep tonight. I plugged in the light then turned and smiled as I looked down at my sleeping son. I was about to head back to my room when I noticed something. Shawns room faced the street, and through his window under the glow of the streetlight was a man. He was a tall thin man, dressed in dark clothes with a long black coat and a wide brimmed hat, concealing his face in shadow. But I could swear I saw the glint of eyes, like an animal's eyes reflected in light, and he was looking right into the window, at me. I stared back for a moment, then the man tipped his hat before turning and walking off into the darkness. 

I grabbed Shawn and took him to my room with Grace, waking her up and telling her what I had seen. 

“Grace, he was in the house I'm sure of it!” I yelled as I pulled my shotgun from the closet and loaded it.  

“Are you sure?” She asked, “Did you see him?”  

Shawn was confused and crying from being woken up and carried roughly through the house, not to mention his half-crazed father shouting and waving a gun around. 

“I didn't see him, but I know he was here, I don't know how, but I know it!” I yelled. 

“Okay.” she said putting her hands on my trembling arms, “Let's just put this down.” She said, taking the shotgun and setting it by the nightstand. “And let's call the police.”  

I nodded, realizing she was right and that I was scaring my son. 

When the sheriff arrived, I told him what had happened and he took down my statement, looking at me pretty dubiously.  

Sheriff Ward had been a longtime friend of my grandfathers; he knew them well and knew my story. 

“So, you're saying that this man broke into your house, moved your son's nightlight and then whistled at your door.” He asked, smoothing his thick white mustache. 

I crossed my arms and dropped my head; this was ridiculous. I was losing my mind. It was probably old trauma from my past rearing its head and making me see and hear things. I felt so embarrassed to have made this into such a big thing. 

Grace said, “Jim says this man was in our house, as crazy as it sounds, I believe him.” 

The Sheriff sighed, “Okay, I'll put out an apb to be on the lookout for anyone suspicious matching your description. And for the time being I'll have a car posted her in case he comes back.” 

“Thank you.” Said Grace.  

I nodded my thanks and we went back inside.  

It was nearly 6:00AM by the time we got Shawn back to bed. Grace had to leave for surgery, and it happened to be a Saturday, so I was off work. I spent the morning drinking coffee and grading papers, and around noon my long-time buddy Ben came over to see how things were going. I told him about what had happened or what I thought had happened over a few beers while Shawn and Bens kids played in the yard.  

“Shits crazy man.” Said Ben, “You think it has something to do with your dad?” 

I looked at him, “What do you mean?” 

Ben leaned back, causing my lawn chain to groan, “Well, seeing as how your dad was murdered when you were a kid, could it be possible that you are seeing things. And you’re having such an extreme reaction to it because you are afraid of being murdered yourself and leaving your son irreparably scarred the way you were?” 

I stared at him for a moment, “Since when are you a fucking psychologist?” 

He laughed, “Hey brother I just call em like I see em.”  

I sighed, “I don't know, maybe you're right, maybe I am overreacting. I should probably make an appointment to see my therapist.” 

Ben shrugged, “Not a bad idea amigo. Now pass me another beer.”  

 

That evening Grace had to work a double shift, so me and Shawn were on our own for dinner. We made homemade pizzas and watched cartoons until the little man fell asleep on the couch. I carried him to bed and tucked him in before heading back downstairs to watch reruns of the twilight zone. 

I had just sat down with my bowl of popcorn as Rod Sterling was wrapping up another episode, when I heard something hit the back door. I looked but I couldn't tell what had made the noise, so I got up and walked over to the back door. “What?” There, just outside on the ground, was Shawn's nightlight. I turned and ran upstairs as fast as I could to check on Shawn, I knew that the light was there when I tucked him in.  

When I got to his room, I saw that he was fine, he was fast asleep. I walked to my room and grabbed the shotgun before heading back downstairs. 

I flung open the door and walked out into the yard raising the shotgun, “Where are you? You son of a bitch! Come out and face me!”  

Then I heard it, a voice, a deep and raspy voice. And it was singing,  

“Oooh death 

OoOh death 

Wont you spare me over til another year” 

My heart froze, the tune... that God damn tune. It was what my mother had been whistling for the past 20 years. I turned in the direction of the voice, and the man stepped out of the shadow of a small tree near the edge of my yard, a shadow far too small to fully conceal him. He was twenty yards away when I raised my shotgun.  

“Who are you?” I yelled.  

The man laughed 

“What do you want?” I demanded. 

The man just laughed and smiled, even from that distance I could see there was something wrong with his teeth. 

“You take one more step and I'll shoot.” I shouted at him. 

He stopped and flung his arms out to the sides in a “Here I am” gesture before continuing forward.  

“I mean it, I'll kill you!” I yelled. 

But he just kept coming, so I fired. Only he wasn't where I was aiming anymore. He was off to the left, so I adjusted my aim and fired again, but he wasn't there either. He was off to the far right, so I took aim and fired again. But again, I missed and in the next moment he was right in front of me. I fell back to the ground just as one of the deputies came running around the side of the house. 

“What the hell are you shooting at?” He yelled. 

In my panic, I had forgotten about the deputy parked out front. I turned back to where the man was, but he was gone. What could I say? I couldn't very well tell him I was shooting at a ghost, even if that's what if felt like. My sanity was already up for debate as far as the sheriff's department was concerned.  

I shakily got to my feet, “Opossum, big Opossum. They like to dig through our trash.  

The deputy shook his head, “Well did you get him at least?” 

“No.” I said looking around the yard, “No, I guess not.”  

For the rest of the night, I sat up in Shawn’s room, my shotgun across my lap, for all the good it had done. When Grace finally made it home, it was nearly 4:30AM. I told her what I had seen and from the look on her face, I could see that she wanted to believe me. But even I knew how it sounded.  

It took some doing but I managed to convince her that maybe I just needed a few days on my own to get my head straight. That morning, she packed up bags for her and Shawn and went to stay at her mother's house for a couple days. I stood in the driveway and waved them off before heading back inside for my car keys. I needed to take another trip to Shady Grove. 

When I arrived, I found mom in the same brightly lit reading room, facing out the same window. Again, I pulled over a chair and sat next to her. 

“Mom, it's Jim. I really need you to talk to me.” I could hear the desperation in my own voice as I pleaded for her to talk. 

“What happened to dad?” I asked, leaving the chair and kneeling down in front of her, “What did you see? Was it a tall thin man?” 

I was answered only by silence and the same vacant stare she always had. 

“He was in my house god dammit!” I erupted. “My son, your grandson, may be in danger! Fucking say something!”  

“Sir.” said one of the nurses approaching from behind me. “You’re gonna need to lower your voice or...” 

“Yeah.” I said interrupting, “Sorry, I was just leaving.” 

I stood and started for the door, then a thought occurred to me. I turned and walked back to stand next to mom. 

“Ooh death.” I began to sing, “OoOh death.” 

And then something happened, something I never thought I would see. Mom slowly turned her head, her eyes widening as tears began to pour down her face. Her lip quivered as she took a sharp inhale of breath, and then she began screaming. Nurses quickly gathered around, pushing me back and taking my screaming mother away. 

30 minutes later, an orderly came and found me sitting numbly in the reading room. “Sir?” 

“Yes?” I said standing up, “How is she?” 

“She’s calmed down now, we’ve given her a mild sedative, she wants to speak to you.” 

The words hit me like a freight train; “She wants to speak to you.” The words I had prayed to hear for the past 20 years, but had given up on. I wordlessly followed the orderly to her room and there she was. Her eyes fluttered up to me as I stepped through the door. Tears burned in mine as she tried to smile. “Hi mom.” I said. She weakly waved me closer, and I knelt down by her side, taking her hand. 

“Jimmy.” She said, her voice was weak and small with disuse.  

“I'm here mom.” I said. Leaning close. 

She leaned forward and whispered in my ear, “He’s coming for you, now.” She smiled sadly as tears ran down her face. 

“Who is he?” I asked. 

She shook her head, “Run if you want, hide if you can. It won't matter in the end.” 

“What are you saying? Run and hide from who?” 

“Find your father's family, they will tell you. He didn't know until it was too late.” 

“Tell me what?” I asked “I don't understand. Who is he?” 

She smiled that same sad smile and put her hand on my cheek, “He’s death.” 

And with that she turned away and closed her eyes. I tried to wake her, but the nurses quickly ushered me out. “She needs her rest.” one of them said, “We will call you if anything changes.” ",1,1769242889.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

1qlhj63,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1qlhj63/the_blood_of_fathers_part_1/,The Blood of Fathers Part 1,"“The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself.” Ezekiel 18:20 

My father was a good man. We were poor growing up, but he did the best he could, working odd jobs here and there to provide for mother and me. We did a lot of moving around when I was younger, lots of new towns, a new school every year or two. My mother used to say we moved so much because, “Daddy got a new better paying job.” in whatever town we would be moving to next. That was always the excuse but by the time I turned twelve, I had stopped believing the recurring lie. Despite dad’s “better job”, we never seemed to have much money. For most of my young life, we lived off the barest of means. In our home, a bologna sandwich was considered to be doing well. 

 I never really learned why we moved around so much. I always had the feeling dad was chasing something or maybe running from something. Unlike mom's usual excuse, dad would never answer when I would ask why we had to leave again; he usually wouldn't even look at me. He would come home from work one evening and loudly announce, “Time to go!” and mom and I would quickly pack up whatever shitty little apartment we happen to be staying in, and we would be on the road that later that night. 

That was my life for 14 years. Then one day I came home from school and dad's pickup was already home. We were staying in a rundown singlewide trailer house just outside of Joplin, Missouri. It was almost unheard of for dad to be home early on a weekday. I mean sure, there were times he would be laid off from wherever he was working at the time, but he would usually scramble to go job hunting that day, and he almost never took sick days. My concern grew as I approached the house and saw that the trucks driver's side door was standing open, and so was the front door to the house.  

I remember that walk, down the driveway to the house. The absolute silence of the world as my footsteps crunched over the gravel and dirt. The creak of each wooden step up to the small wobbly porch. The feel of the warm breeze that blew through the trailers open door, carrying with it a coppery smell. I saw mom first. I could see her through the open door, slumped down against the wall beside the couch; her knees pulled up to her chest. She was pale and wouldn't look at me, no matter how loud I called to her. She just stared straight ahead, shivering. After summoning up as much courage as I could, I stepped into the house and around the corner, and there was dad. At first, I couldn't understand what I was seeing, I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that this was really happening, that that was dad. He was on his back, on top of the dining room table. His head hung backwards off of the edge, at too sharp of an angle. His eyes rolled in their sockets before focusing on me for the briefest of moments. He tried to speak but all that came out was a sickening gurgle as blood poured from his lips and his throat... God his throat, it was gone. It was like it had been ripped away and flung across the room. Blood coated the walls and ceiling in thick dripping lines. I screamed and turned to mom, trying to shake her out of her shock or whatever was happening, but she just kept staring straight ahead, she never even acknowledged me. 

 I don't remember much after that, but they say I ran to a neighbor's house and got them to call 911. Dad was obviously dead when the ambulance and police arrived. They took mom to the hospital and tried to get her to tell them what she had seen, but I guess the shock was too deep. She wouldn’t speak; she stopped eating, stopped drinking and was eventually admitted to the psyche ward. For years, therapists tried to reach her, to help her to process and talk about what she had seen. Unfortunately, mom never spoke again.  

After the incident, I ended up moving in with my grandparents in El Paso. They had mom moved to an assisted living home an hour's drive from their house. We would go visit her two to three times a week for the first couple of years, hoping and praying that she would come back to us. But she never did. Occasionally she would whistle, but only ever one tune. Grandpa said the tune sounded familiar, but he could never place it; no one could. Eventually the visits became once a week, then every other week, once a month. By the time I was 18, I only saw mom a couple times a year for special occasions. I spent a lot of my free time in therapy, trying to deal with my trauma, but I had nightmares of my dad's face for years, still do sometimes. 

 My life with my grandparents was more comfortable than I could ever have imagined. I had good food, a warm bed every night, and I was finally in school long enough to make real, lasting friendships. And I struggled with the guilt that I was happier with my grandparents than I ever was with my parents.  

Now I'm a relatively happy, stable, and sane 35-year-old history teacher with a wife and a son of my own, despite the trauma I went through as a child. At least I thought I was sane. For the past couple weeks, I've been waking up in the middle of the night with my mother's whistle stuck in my head. On one particularly rough night, Grace told me it could be the manifestation of my guilt for not visiting mom in a while. It made sense, after all I hadn't gone to visit for the past two years. But to be honest, I didn’t feel much guilt. Maybe that made me an asshole, but I was pretty sure she didn’t even know who I was when I did visit. But, I was off work the next day, so I figured I had no excuse to not go for a visit.  

That morning, I filled my coffee cup, got Shawn off to preschool and headed for the Shady Grove care home. I still lived roughly an hour from the home, plenty of time to think on the drive. I thought about how things were when I was a kid, about mom and what she had seen... about dad. The look on his face as his loose neck swiveled toward me. What did he try to say? Who did that to him? What had mom seen? I realized my hand was shaking as I raised my coffee to my lips and did my best to clear my mind of the questions that would probably never be answered. I took a steadying breath and turned up the radio.  

Shady Grove was a very upscale assisted living home, one of the most celebrated in the state, if the banner in the lobby was to be believed.  

“Hi Susan.” I said as I approached the nurse's desk. 

The older woman with big poofy blonde hair looked up and studied me for a moment before recognition spread a smile on her face, “Jim, hi. Wow it's been a while.”  

I nodded, “Yeah well, I've been busy.” Clearing my throat I continued, “How is she?” 

Susan stood up and came around the desk shaking her head, “Oh you know her, she just sits quietly most of the time. Although some of the night staff say she has started whistling more at night lately. Come on, I'll take you to her.” 

“Really?” I asked as I followed, “How long has she been doing that for?” 

“Oh, just the past week or so.”  

That was one hell of a coincidence, I thought as we walked down the sterile white halls, the smell of soiled bed sheets, bleach, and stale body odor permeating the air. I hated this place, it felt like deaths waiting room.  

Finally, Susan brought me to a brightly lit reading room with large windows facing a garden outside. There she was, sitting slumped in her wheelchair. Her once dark brown hair now turned gray, hung down around her shoulders in tangles. I slowly walked across the room, picking up a white plastic chair on the way. Setting the chair next to her I sat down and looked her over.  

“Hey mom.” I said, touching her arm.  

She didn't look at me; she never did. Her vacant eyes stayed fixed forward. Lost in a moment, years ago.  

“Mom, it's Jim. Your son.”  

Still no reaction. I don't know why I always come here expecting anything else. I nodded, “It's okay mom, I'll just sit here with you for a while.” 

We sat and watched the butterflies in the garden for a while. Then I stood and just as I was about to leave, mom started to whistle. When I turned to look at her, I noticed something I hadn't seen before. Her eyes, while still mostly fixed straight forward, had more focus in them than I had seen in years. 

“Mom?” I asked. Bending down to her.  

She didn't answer just kept whistling and looking straight ahead, a single tear broke from her left eye and ran down her face. She was focused on something. I turned to see where she was looking. Out the window, across the garden, in a darkened upstairs window on the other side of the courtyard. At first, I thought I could see something, was it a person? I couldn't tell. But when I blinked, whatever I thought I saw was gone. 

I stopped another nurse as she passed, “Excuse me, could you tell me what's on the other side of the building there?” I asked as I pointed to the darkened window. 

“Oh, that's going to be the therapeutic wing when its finished, unfortunately the contractors are dragging their feet lately.” She answered. 

“So, it’s empty? Theres nothing or no one in there?” 

“Shouldn't be. Unless it was one of the workers.”  

I nodded and turned back to mom as she slowly stopped whistling and went back to her vacant stare. I looked back at the window again but there was nothing there. I sighed and bent down to kiss mom on the cheek. “Goodbye mom, I'll see you next time.” And with that I left Shady Grove. 

That night after dinner and putting Shawn to bed, I spoke with Grace about the visit with my mother while we washed the dishes. 

“Well, it sounds like not much has changed. Do you at least feel better after seeing her?” She asked. 

“I don't know, maybe. On the one hand it was good to see her, but...” I trailed off as I absently dried a plate. 

“But?” Prompted Grace. 

I shrugged, “But at the same time, she’s not her. Not the mother I grew up with. I keep waiting for her to snap out of it. Every time I visit, I walk in thinking maybe this time she will turn and just... speak, say something, say anything.”   

Grace put her hand on my shoulder, “I'm sorry.”  

“I know it's awful, but sometimes I wish that if she can't get better, she could just move on.” I turned to my wife. “Does that make me a monster?”  

She put down her towel and wrapped her arms around me, “No, honey. It just means you just want her to be free, whatever freedom looks like.”  

I smiled, “Sounds a lot nicer the way you say it.” 

Grace smiled back, “Well I'm a little nicer than you are.” 

We laughed and I leaned in and kissed her. And then Shawn started yelling.  

“Momma I had a bad dream!” He cried. 

Grace sighed and smiled up at me, “To be continued.” She said before turning and heading for Shawn’s room, leaving me to finish the dishes. 

 

I woke up again that night, it wasn't the whistling in my head though. You know how when you think you are alone, but then you slowly get that feeling crawling up your spine that someone somewhere is looking at you? It was like that. I sat up and looked around the room but saw only shadows. The clock on the nightstand showed 3:30AM. I lay back down and tried to get to sleep but I just tossed and turned. 

 After a while I decided to get up for a glass of water. I left my bedroom and walked down the hall past Shawns' room, his SpongeBob nightlight illuminating his room in a soft yellow glow. Down the stairs, through the front room, and into the kitchen. I downed one glass and was about to fill it again when I heard it. The whistle. Moms whistle. Only it wasn't in my head. It was on the other side of my front door.  

I froze listening to the whistle for a solid minute before it stopped. It was the exact same tune. I stepped through the house as if on autopilot and approached the front door. Was mom out there? Could she have gotten here? No, no she didn't even know where I lived. My heart was pounding as I looked through the peep hole. But, there was no one there. I pulled the curtain on the front room window aside and looked out but still, I saw nothing. Just the empty street, the neighbor's houses were all dark except for porch lights and the single streetlight on the corner. Was it just in my head? I wondered. Maybe I really was losing it.  

I went back to the kitchen and drank another half glass of water before walking back upstairs and past Shawns' room, Shawns' dark room. I stopped and walked back down the hall and into his room. I bent down next to the outlet, feeling around for the nightlight, thinking that maybe it had fallen. When I couldn't find it, I just shrugged and headed back to bed. Only when I got there, that's when I found the nightlight. It was sitting right there on my pillow. “What the hell?”  

I picked up the nightlight and looked it over, wondering how it had gotten there. I almost woke grace and asked her, but she had to perform surgery in the morning and needed her sleep. I took the nightlight and made my way back down the hall to Shawn’s room to plug it in. If he woke up without it, he would not be getting back to sleep tonight. I plugged in the light then turned and smiled as I looked down at my sleeping son. I was about to head back to my room when I noticed something. Shawns room faced the street, and through his window under the glow of the streetlight was a man. He was a tall thin man, dressed in dark clothes with a long black coat and a wide brimmed hat, concealing his face in shadow. But I could swear I saw the glint of eyes, like an animal's eyes reflected in light, and he was looking right into the window, at me. I stared back for a moment, then the man tipped his hat before turning and walking off into the darkness. 

I grabbed Shawn and took him to my room with Grace, waking her up and telling her what I had seen. 

“Grace, he was in the house I'm sure of it!” I yelled as I pulled my shotgun from the closet and loaded it.  

“Are you sure?” She asked, “Did you see him?”  

Shawn was confused and crying from being woken up and carried roughly through the house, not to mention his half-crazed father shouting and waving a gun around. 

“I didn't see him, but I know he was here, I don't know how, but I know it!” I yelled. 

“Okay.” she said putting her hands on my trembling arms, “Let's just put this down.” She said, taking the shotgun and setting it by the nightstand. “And let's call the police.”  

I nodded, realizing she was right and that I was scaring my son. 

When the sheriff arrived, I told him what had happened and he took down my statement, looking at me pretty dubiously.  

Sheriff Ward had been a longtime friend of my grandfathers; he knew them well and knew my story. 

“So, you're saying that this man broke into your house, moved your son's nightlight and then whistled at your door.” He asked, smoothing his thick white mustache. 

I crossed my arms and dropped my head; this was ridiculous. I was losing my mind. It was probably old trauma from my past rearing its head and making me see and hear things. I felt so embarrassed to have made this into such a big thing. 

Grace said, “Jim says this man was in our house, as crazy as it sounds, I believe him.” 

The Sheriff sighed, “Okay, I'll put out an apb to be on the lookout for anyone suspicious matching your description. And for the time being I'll have a car posted her in case he comes back.” 

“Thank you.” Said Grace.  

I nodded my thanks and we went back inside.  

It was nearly 6:00AM by the time we got Shawn back to bed. Grace had to leave for surgery, and it happened to be a Saturday, so I was off work. I spent the morning drinking coffee and grading papers, and around noon my long-time buddy Ben came over to see how things were going. I told him about what had happened or what I thought had happened over a few beers while Shawn and Bens kids played in the yard.  

“Shits crazy man.” Said Ben, “You think it has something to do with your dad?” 

I looked at him, “What do you mean?” 

Ben leaned back, causing my lawn chain to groan, “Well, seeing as how your dad was murdered when you were a kid, could it be possible that you are seeing things. And you’re having such an extreme reaction to it because you are afraid of being murdered yourself and leaving your son irreparably scarred the way you were?” 

I stared at him for a moment, “Since when are you a fucking psychologist?” 

He laughed, “Hey brother I just call em like I see em.”  

I sighed, “I don't know, maybe you're right, maybe I am overreacting. I should probably make an appointment to see my therapist.” 

Ben shrugged, “Not a bad idea amigo. Now pass me another beer.”  

 

That evening Grace had to work a double shift, so me and Shawn were on our own for dinner. We made homemade pizzas and watched cartoons until the little man fell asleep on the couch. I carried him to bed and tucked him in before heading back downstairs to watch reruns of the twilight zone. 

I had just sat down with my bowl of popcorn as Rod Sterling was wrapping up another episode, when I heard something hit the back door. I looked but I couldn't tell what had made the noise, so I got up and walked over to the back door. “What?” There, just outside on the ground, was Shawn's nightlight. I turned and ran upstairs as fast as I could to check on Shawn, I knew that the light was there when I tucked him in.  

When I got to his room, I saw that he was fine, he was fast asleep. I walked to my room and grabbed the shotgun before heading back downstairs. 

I flung open the door and walked out into the yard raising the shotgun, “Where are you? You son of a bitch! Come out and face me!”  

Then I heard it, a voice, a deep and raspy voice. And it was singing,  

“Oooh death 

OoOh death 

Wont you spare me over til another year” 

My heart froze, the tune... that God damn tune. It was what my mother had been whistling for the past 20 years. I turned in the direction of the voice, and the man stepped out of the shadow of a small tree near the edge of my yard, a shadow far too small to fully conceal him. He was twenty yards away when I raised my shotgun.  

“Who are you?” I yelled.  

The man laughed 

“What do you want?” I demanded. 

The man just laughed and smiled, even from that distance I could see there was something wrong with his teeth. 

“You take one more step and I'll shoot.” I shouted at him. 

He stopped and flung his arms out to the sides in a “Here I am” gesture before continuing forward.  

“I mean it, I'll kill you!” I yelled. 

But he just kept coming, so I fired. Only he wasn't where I was aiming anymore. He was off to the left, so I adjusted my aim and fired again, but he wasn't there either. He was off to the far right, so I took aim and fired again. But again, I missed and in the next moment he was right in front of me. I fell back to the ground just as one of the deputies came running around the side of the house. 

“What the hell are you shooting at?” He yelled. 

In my panic, I had forgotten about the deputy parked out front. I turned back to where the man was, but he was gone. What could I say? I couldn't very well tell him I was shooting at a ghost, even if that's what if felt like. My sanity was already up for debate as far as the sheriff's department was concerned.  

I shakily got to my feet, “Opossum, big Opossum. They like to dig through our trash.  

The deputy shook his head, “Well did you get him at least?” 

“No.” I said looking around the yard, “No, I guess not.”  

For the rest of the night, I sat up in Shawn’s room, my shotgun across my lap, for all the good it had done. When Grace finally made it home, it was nearly 4:30AM. I told her what I had seen and from the look on her face, I could see that she wanted to believe me. But even I knew how it sounded.  

It took some doing but I managed to convince her that maybe I just needed a few days on my own to get my head straight. That morning, she packed up bags for her and Shawn and went to stay at her mother's house for a couple days. I stood in the driveway and waved them off before heading back inside for my car keys. I needed to take another trip to Shady Grove. 

When I arrived, I found mom in the same brightly lit reading room, facing out the same window. Again, I pulled over a chair and sat next to her. 

“Mom, it's Jim. I really need you to talk to me.” I could hear the desperation in my own voice as I pleaded for her to talk. 

“What happened to dad?” I asked, leaving the chair and kneeling down in front of her, “What did you see? Was it a tall thin man?” 

I was answered only by silence and the same vacant stare she always had. 

“He was in my house god dammit!” I erupted. “My son, your grandson, may be in danger! Fucking say something!”  

“Sir.” said one of the nurses approaching from behind me. “You’re gonna need to lower your voice or...” 

“Yeah.” I said interrupting, “Sorry, I was just leaving.” 

I stood and started for the door, then a thought occurred to me. I turned and walked back to stand next to mom. 

“Ooh death.” I began to sing, “OoOh death.” 

And then something happened, something I never thought I would see. Mom slowly turned her head, her eyes widening as tears began to pour down her face. Her lip quivered as she took a sharp inhale of breath, and then she began screaming. Nurses quickly gathered around, pushing me back and taking my screaming mother away. 

30 minutes later, an orderly came and found me sitting numbly in the reading room. “Sir?” 

“Yes?” I said standing up, “How is she?” 

“She’s calmed down now, we’ve given her a mild sedative, she wants to speak to you.” 

The words hit me like a freight train; “She wants to speak to you.” The words I had prayed to hear for the past 20 years, but had given up on. I wordlessly followed the orderly to her room and there she was. Her eyes fluttered up to me as I stepped through the door. Tears burned in mine as she tried to smile. “Hi mom.” I said. She weakly waved me closer, and I knelt down by her side, taking her hand. 

“Jimmy.” She said, her voice was weak and small with disuse.  

“I'm here mom.” I said. Leaning close. 

She leaned forward and whispered in my ear, “He’s coming for you, now.” She smiled sadly as tears ran down her face. 

“Who is he?” I asked. 

She shook her head, “Run if you want, hide if you can. It won't matter in the end.” 

“What are you saying? Run and hide from who?” 

“Find your father's family, they will tell you. He didn't know until it was too late.” 

“Tell me what?” I asked “I don't understand. Who is he?” 

She smiled that same sad smile and put her hand on my cheek, “He’s death.” 

And with that she turned away and closed her eyes. I tried to wake her, but the nurses quickly ushered me out. “She needs her rest.” one of them said, “We will call you if anything changes.” ",3,1769242827.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False

The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself.” Ezekiel 18:20 

My father was a good man. We were poor growing up, but he did the best he could, working odd jobs here and there to provide for mother and me. We did a lot of moving around when I was younger, lots of new towns, a new school every year or two. My mother used to say we moved so much because, “Daddy got a new better paying job.” in whatever town we would be moving to next. That was always the excuse but by the time I turned twelve, I had stopped believing the recurring lie. Despite dad’s “better job”, we never seemed to have much money. For most of my young life, we lived off the barest of means. In our home, a bologna sandwich was considered to be doing well. 

 I never really learned why we moved around so much. I always had the feeling dad was chasing something or maybe running from something. Unlike mom's usual excuse, dad would never answer when I would ask why we had to leave again; he usually wouldn't even look at me. He would come home from work one evening and loudly announce, “Time to go!” and mom and I would quickly pack up whatever shitty little apartment we happen to be staying in, and we would be on the road that later that night. 

That was my life for 14 years. Then one day I came home from school and dad's pickup was already home. We were staying in a rundown singlewide trailer house just outside of Joplin, Missouri. It was almost unheard of for dad to be home early on a weekday. I mean sure, there were times he would be laid off from wherever he was working at the time, but he would usually scramble to go job hunting that day, and he almost never took sick days. My concern grew as I approached the house and saw that the trucks driver's side door was standing open, and so was the front door to the house.  

I remember that walk, down the driveway to the house. The absolute silence of the world as my footsteps crunched over the gravel and dirt. The creak of each wooden step up to the small wobbly porch. The feel of the warm breeze that blew through the trailers open door, carrying with it a coppery smell. I saw mom first. I could see her through the open door, slumped down against the wall beside the couch; her knees pulled up to her chest. She was pale and wouldn't look at me, no matter how loud I called to her. She just stared straight ahead, shivering. After summoning up as much courage as I could, I stepped into the house and around the corner, and there was dad. At first, I couldn't understand what I was seeing, I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that this was really happening, that that was dad. He was on his back, on top of the dining room table. His head hung backwards off of the edge, at too sharp of an angle. His eyes rolled in their sockets before focusing on me for the briefest of moments. He tried to speak but all that came out was a sickening gurgle as blood poured from his lips and his throat... God his throat, it was gone. It was like it had been ripped away and flung across the room. Blood coated the walls and ceiling in thick dripping lines. I screamed and turned to mom, trying to shake her out of her shock or whatever was happening, but she just kept staring straight ahead, she never even acknowledged me. 

 I don't remember much after that, but they say I ran to a neighbor's house and got them to call 911. Dad was obviously dead when the ambulance and police arrived. They took mom to the hospital and tried to get her to tell them what she had seen, but I guess the shock was too deep. She wouldn’t speak; she stopped eating, stopped drinking and was eventually admitted to the psyche ward. For years, therapists tried to reach her, to help her to process and talk about what she had seen. Unfortunately, mom never spoke again.  

After the incident, I ended up moving in with my grandparents in El Paso. They had mom moved to an assisted living home an hour's drive from their house. We would go visit her two to three times a week for the first couple of years, hoping and praying that she would come back to us. But she never did. Occasionally she would whistle, but only ever one tune. Grandpa said the tune sounded familiar, but he could never place it; no one could. Eventually the visits became once a week, then every other week, once a month. By the time I was 18, I only saw mom a couple times a year for special occasions. I spent a lot of my free time in therapy, trying to deal with my trauma, but I had nightmares of my dad's face for years, still do sometimes. 

 My life with my grandparents was more comfortable than I could ever have imagined. I had good food, a warm bed every night, and I was finally in school long enough to make real, lasting friendships. And I struggled with the guilt that I was happier with my grandparents than I ever was with my parents.  

Now I'm a relatively happy, stable, and sane 35-year-old history teacher with a wife and a son of my own, despite the trauma I went through as a child. At least I thought I was sane. For the past couple weeks, I've been waking up in the middle of the night with my mother's whistle stuck in my head. On one particularly rough night, Grace told me it could be the manifestation of my guilt for not visiting mom in a while. It made sense, after all I hadn't gone to visit for the past two years. But to be honest, I didn’t feel much guilt. Maybe that made me an asshole, but I was pretty sure she didn’t even know who I was when I did visit. But, I was off work the next day, so I figured I had no excuse to not go for a visit.  

That morning, I filled my coffee cup, got Shawn off to preschool and headed for the Shady Grove care home. I still lived roughly an hour from the home, plenty of time to think on the drive. I thought about how things were when I was a kid, about mom and what she had seen... about dad. The look on his face as his loose neck swiveled toward me. What did he try to say? Who did that to him? What had mom seen? I realized my hand was shaking as I raised my coffee to my lips and did my best to clear my mind of the questions that would probably never be answered. I took a steadying breath and turned up the radio.  

Shady Grove was a very upscale assisted living home, one of the most celebrated in the state, if the banner in the lobby was to be believed.  

“Hi Susan.” I said as I approached the nurse's desk. 

The older woman with big poofy blonde hair looked up and studied me for a moment before recognition spread a smile on her face, “Jim, hi. Wow it's been a while.”  

I nodded, “Yeah well, I've been busy.” Clearing my throat I continued, “How is she?” 

Susan stood up and came around the desk shaking her head, “Oh you know her, she just sits quietly most of the time. Although some of the night staff say she has started whistling more at night lately. Come on, I'll take you to her.” 

“Really?” I asked as I followed, “How long has she been doing that for?” 

“Oh, just the past week or so.”  

That was one hell of a coincidence, I thought as we walked down the sterile white halls, the smell of soiled bed sheets, bleach, and stale body odor permeating the air. I hated this place, it felt like deaths waiting room.  

Finally, Susan brought me to a brightly lit reading room with large windows facing a garden outside. There she was, sitting slumped in her wheelchair. Her once dark brown hair now turned gray, hung down around her shoulders in tangles. I slowly walked across the room, picking up a white plastic chair on the way. Setting the chair next to her I sat down and looked her over.  

“Hey mom.” I said, touching her arm.  

She didn't look at me; she never did. Her vacant eyes stayed fixed forward. Lost in a moment, years ago.  

“Mom, it's Jim. Your son.”  

Still no reaction. I don't know why I always come here expecting anything else. I nodded, “It's okay mom, I'll just sit here with you for a while.” 

We sat and watched the butterflies in the garden for a while. Then I stood and just as I was about to leave, mom started to whistle. When I turned to look at her, I noticed something I hadn't seen before. Her eyes, while still mostly fixed straight forward, had more focus in them than I had seen in years. 

“Mom?” I asked. Bending down to her.  

She didn't answer just kept whistling and looking straight ahead, a single tear broke from her left eye and ran down her face. She was focused on something. I turned to see where she was looking. Out the window, across the garden, in a darkened upstairs window on the other side of the courtyard. At first, I thought I could see something, was it a person? I couldn't tell. But when I blinked, whatever I thought I saw was gone. 

I stopped another nurse as she passed, “Excuse me, could you tell me what's on the other side of the building there?” I asked as I pointed to the darkened window. 

“Oh, that's going to be the therapeutic wing when its finished, unfortunately the contractors are dragging their feet lately.” She answered. 

“So, it’s empty? Theres nothing or no one in there?” 

“Shouldn't be. Unless it was one of the workers.”  

I nodded and turned back to mom as she slowly stopped whistling and went back to her vacant stare. I looked back at the window again but there was nothing there. I sighed and bent down to kiss mom on the cheek. “Goodbye mom, I'll see you next time.” And with that I left Shady Grove. 

That night after dinner and putting Shawn to bed, I spoke with Grace about the visit with my mother while we washed the dishes. 

“Well, it sounds like not much has changed. Do you at least feel better after seeing her?” She asked. 

“I don't know, maybe. On the one hand it was good to see her, but...” I trailed off as I absently dried a plate. 

“But?” Prompted Grace. 

I shrugged, “But at the same time, she’s not her. Not the mother I grew up with. I keep waiting for her to snap out of it. Every time I visit, I walk in thinking maybe this time she will turn and just... speak, say something, say anything.”   

Grace put her hand on my shoulder, “I'm sorry.”  

“I know it's awful, but sometimes I wish that if she can't get better, she could just move on.” I turned to my wife. “Does that make me a monster?”  

She put down her towel and wrapped her arms around me, “No, honey. It just means you just want her to be free, whatever freedom looks like.”  

I smiled, “Sounds a lot nicer the way you say it.” 

Grace smiled back, “Well I'm a little nicer than you are.” 

We laughed and I leaned in and kissed her. And then Shawn started yelling.  

“Momma I had a bad dream!” He cried. 

Grace sighed and smiled up at me, “To be continued.” She said before turning and heading for Shawn’s room, leaving me to finish the dishes. 

 

I woke up again that night, it wasn't the whistling in my head though. You know how when you think you are alone, but then you slowly get that feeling crawling up your spine that someone somewhere is looking at you? It was like that. I sat up and looked around the room but saw only shadows. The clock on the nightstand showed 3:30AM. I lay back down and tried to get to sleep but I just tossed and turned. 

 After a while I decided to get up for a glass of water. I left my bedroom and walked down the hall past Shawns' room, his SpongeBob nightlight illuminating his room in a soft yellow glow. Down the stairs, through the front room, and into the kitchen. I downed one glass and was about to fill it again when I heard it. The whistle. Moms whistle. Only it wasn't in my head. It was on the other side of my front door.  

I froze listening to the whistle for a solid minute before it stopped. It was the exact same tune. I stepped through the house as if on autopilot and approached the front door. Was mom out there? Could she have gotten here? No, no she didn't even know where I lived. My heart was pounding as I looked through the peep hole. But, there was no one there. I pulled the curtain on the front room window aside and looked out but still, I saw nothing. Just the empty street, the neighbor's houses were all dark except for porch lights and the single streetlight on the corner. Was it just in my head? I wondered. Maybe I really was losing it.  

I went back to the kitchen and drank another half glass of water before walking back upstairs and past Shawns' room, Shawns' dark room. I stopped and walked back down the hall and into his room. I bent down next to the outlet, feeling around for the nightlight, thinking that maybe it had fallen. When I couldn't find it, I just shrugged and headed back to bed. Only when I got there, that's when I found the nightlight. It was sitting right there on my pillow. “What the hell?”  

I picked up the nightlight and looked it over, wondering how it had gotten there. I almost woke grace and asked her, but she had to perform surgery in the morning and needed her sleep. I took the nightlight and made my way back down the hall to Shawn’s room to plug it in. If he woke up without it, he would not be getting back to sleep tonight. I plugged in the light then turned and smiled as I looked down at my sleeping son. I was about to head back to my room when I noticed something. Shawns room faced the street, and through his window under the glow of the streetlight was a man. He was a tall thin man, dressed in dark clothes with a long black coat and a wide brimmed hat, concealing his face in shadow. But I could swear I saw the glint of eyes, like an animal's eyes reflected in light, and he was looking right into the window, at me. I stared back for a moment, then the man tipped his hat before turning and walking off into the darkness. 

I grabbed Shawn and took him to my room with Grace, waking her up and telling her what I had seen. 

“Grace, he was in the house I'm sure of it!” I yelled as I pulled my shotgun from the closet and loaded it.  

“Are you sure?” She asked, “Did you see him?”  

Shawn was confused and crying from being woken up and carried roughly through the house, not to mention his half-crazed father shouting and waving a gun around. 

“I didn't see him, but I know he was here, I don't know how, but I know it!” I yelled. 

“Okay.” she said putting her hands on my trembling arms, “Let's just put this down.” She said, taking the shotgun and setting it by the nightstand. “And let's call the police.”  

I nodded, realizing she was right and that I was scaring my son. 

When the sheriff arrived, I told him what had happened and he took down my statement, looking at me pretty dubiously.  

Sheriff Ward had been a longtime friend of my grandfathers; he knew them well and knew my story. 

“So, you're saying that this man broke into your house, moved your son's nightlight and then whistled at your door.” He asked, smoothing his thick white mustache. 

I crossed my arms and dropped my head; this was ridiculous. I was losing my mind. It was probably old trauma from my past rearing its head and making me see and hear things. I felt so embarrassed to have made this into such a big thing. 

Grace said, “Jim says this man was in our house, as crazy as it sounds, I believe him.” 

The Sheriff sighed, “Okay, I'll put out an apb to be on the lookout for anyone suspicious matching your description. And for the time being I'll have a car posted her in case he comes back.” 

“Thank you.” Said Grace.  

I nodded my thanks and we went back inside.  

It was nearly 6:00AM by the time we got Shawn back to bed. Grace had to leave for surgery, and it happened to be a Saturday, so I was off work. I spent the morning drinking coffee and grading papers, and around noon my long-time buddy Ben came over to see how things were going. I told him about what had happened or what I thought had happened over a few beers while Shawn and Bens kids played in the yard.  

“Shits crazy man.” Said Ben, “You think it has something to do with your dad?” 

I looked at him, “What do you mean?” 

Ben leaned back, causing my lawn chain to groan, “Well, seeing as how your dad was murdered when you were a kid, could it be possible that you are seeing things. And you’re having such an extreme reaction to it because you are afraid of being murdered yourself and leaving your son irreparably scarred the way you were?” 

I stared at him for a moment, “Since when are you a fucking psychologist?” 

He laughed, “Hey brother I just call em like I see em.”  

I sighed, “I don't know, maybe you're right, maybe I am overreacting. I should probably make an appointment to see my therapist.” 

Ben shrugged, “Not a bad idea amigo. Now pass me another beer.”  

 

That evening Grace had to work a double shift, so me and Shawn were on our own for dinner. We made homemade pizzas and watched cartoons until the little man fell asleep on the couch. I carried him to bed and tucked him in before heading back downstairs to watch reruns of the twilight zone. 

I had just sat down with my bowl of popcorn as Rod Sterling was wrapping up another episode, when I heard something hit the back door. I looked but I couldn't tell what had made the noise, so I got up and walked over to the back door. “What?” There, just outside on the ground, was Shawn's nightlight. I turned and ran upstairs as fast as I could to check on Shawn, I knew that the light was there when I tucked him in.  

When I got to his room, I saw that he was fine, he was fast asleep. I walked to my room and grabbed the shotgun before heading back downstairs. 

I flung open the door and walked out into the yard raising the shotgun, “Where are you? You son of a bitch! Come out and face me!”  

Then I heard it, a voice, a deep and raspy voice. And it was singing,  

“Oooh death 

OoOh death 

Wont you spare me over til another year” 

My heart froze, the tune... that God damn tune. It was what my mother had been whistling for the past 20 years. I turned in the direction of the voice, and the man stepped out of the shadow of a small tree near the edge of my yard, a shadow far too small to fully conceal him. He was twenty yards away when I raised my shotgun.  

“Who are you?” I yelled.  

The man laughed 

“What do you want?” I demanded. 

The man just laughed and smiled, even from that distance I could see there was something wrong with his teeth. 

“You take one more step and I'll shoot.” I shouted at him. 

He stopped and flung his arms out to the sides in a “Here I am” gesture before continuing forward.  

“I mean it, I'll kill you!” I yelled. 

But he just kept coming, so I fired. Only he wasn't where I was aiming anymore. He was off to the left, so I adjusted my aim and fired again, but he wasn't there either. He was off to the far right, so I took aim and fired again. But again, I missed and in the next moment he was right in front of me. I fell back to the ground just as one of the deputies came running around the side of the house. 

“What the hell are you shooting at?” He yelled. 

In my panic, I had forgotten about the deputy parked out front. I turned back to where the man was, but he was gone. What could I say? I couldn't very well tell him I was shooting at a ghost, even if that's what if felt like. My sanity was already up for debate as far as the sheriff's department was concerned.  

I shakily got to my feet, “Opossum, big Opossum. They like to dig through our trash.  

The deputy shook his head, “Well did you get him at least?” 

“No.” I said looking around the yard, “No, I guess not.”  

For the rest of the night, I sat up in Shawn’s room, my shotgun across my lap, for all the good it had done. When Grace finally made it home, it was nearly 4:30AM. I told her what I had seen and from the look on her face, I could see that she wanted to believe me. But even I knew how it sounded.  

It took some doing but I managed to convince her that maybe I just needed a few days on my own to get my head straight. That morning, she packed up bags for her and Shawn and went to stay at her mother's house for a couple days. I stood in the driveway and waved them off before heading back inside for my car keys. I needed to take another trip to Shady Grove. 

When I arrived, I found mom in the same brightly lit reading room, facing out the same window. Again, I pulled over a chair and sat next to her. 

“Mom, it's Jim. I really need you to talk to me.” I could hear the desperation in my own voice as I pleaded for her to talk. 

“What happened to dad?” I asked, leaving the chair and kneeling down in front of her, “What did you see? Was it a tall thin man?” 

I was answered only by silence and the same vacant stare she always had. 

“He was in my house god dammit!” I erupted. “My son, your grandson, may be in danger! Fucking say something!”  

“Sir.” said one of the nurses approaching from behind me. “You’re gonna need to lower your voice or...” 

“Yeah.” I said interrupting, “Sorry, I was just leaving.” 

I stood and started for the door, then a thought occurred to me. I turned and walked back to stand next to mom. 

“Ooh death.” I began to sing, “OoOh death.” 

And then something happened, something I never thought I would see. Mom slowly turned her head, her eyes widening as tears began to pour down her face. Her lip quivered as she took a sharp inhale of breath, and then she began screaming. Nurses quickly gathered around, pushing me back and taking my screaming mother away. 

30 minutes later, an orderly came and found me sitting numbly in the reading room. “Sir?” 

“Yes?” I said standing up, “How is she?” 

“She’s calmed down now, we’ve given her a mild sedative, she wants to speak to you.” 

The words hit me like a freight train; “She wants to speak to you.” The words I had prayed to hear for the past 20 years, but had given up on. I wordlessly followed the orderly to her room and there she was. Her eyes fluttered up to me as I stepped through the door. Tears burned in mine as she tried to smile. “Hi mom.” I said. She weakly waved me closer, and I knelt down by her side, taking her hand. 

“Jimmy.” She said, her voice was weak and small with disuse.  

“I'm here mom.” I said. Leaning close. 

She leaned forward and whispered in my ear, “He’s coming for you, now.” She smiled sadly as tears ran down her face. 

“Who is he?” I asked. 

She shook her head, “Run if you want, hide if you can. It won't matter in the end.” 

“What are you saying? Run and hide from who?” 

“Find your father's family, they will tell you. He didn't know until it was too late.” 

“Tell me what?” I asked “I don't understand. Who is he?” 

She smiled that same sad smile and put her hand on my cheek, “He’s death.” 

And with that she turned away and closed her eyes. I tried to wake her, but the nurses quickly ushered me out. “She needs her rest.” one of them said, “We will call you if anything changes.” ",1,1769242756.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1qlhi32,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qlhi32/advice_for_k6_and_flat_brewer_and_more/,Advice for K6 and flat brewer (and more),"I've got a Kingrinder K6 and I like it but I rarely get the ""A damn fine cup of coffee"" cups. I usually end up with mid cups. 

I use a Varia Flo (this is the interchangeable flat bottom brewer from Varia), good quality coffee from local roasters and I pay attention to water, temp and resting times. 

My usual recipe is something like: 

90C temp

15g coffee to 250ml water

50 g Bloom for 45s -> add 50g -> add the rest of the water (usually done by 3:00)

Grind size 90-85 clicks

The cups are balanced but lack character most of the time, but sometimes (even if I don't seem to change anything) I get a very floral, sweet, interesting cup.

What are your to-go recipes for flat-bottom brewers and even for basic V60 (got one around but I like the balanced cups from Varia more)? Also, do you have any tips for the grinder? 

Not sure if important but my 0 point is on -3 clicks. 

I know there are many recipes around but I wanted to start a new discussion, getting some fresh takes. Thank you!

The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself.” Ezekiel 18:20 

My father was a good man. We were poor growing up, but he did the best he could, working odd jobs here and there to provide for mother and me. We did a lot of moving around when I was younger, lots of new towns, a new school every year or two. My mother used to say we moved so much because, “Daddy got a new better paying job.” in whatever town we would be moving to next. That was always the excuse but by the time I turned twelve, I had stopped believing the recurring lie. Despite dad’s “better job”, we never seemed to have much money. For most of my young life, we lived off the barest of means. In our home, a bologna sandwich was considered to be doing well. 

 I never really learned why we moved around so much. I always had the feeling dad was chasing something or maybe running from something. Unlike mom's usual excuse, dad would never answer when I would ask why we had to leave again; he usually wouldn't even look at me. He would come home from work one evening and loudly announce, “Time to go!” and mom and I would quickly pack up whatever shitty little apartment we happen to be staying in, and we would be on the road that later that night. 

That was my life for 14 years. Then one day I came home from school and dad's pickup was already home. We were staying in a rundown singlewide trailer house just outside of Joplin, Missouri. It was almost unheard of for dad to be home early on a weekday. I mean sure, there were times he would be laid off from wherever he was working at the time, but he would usually scramble to go job hunting that day, and he almost never took sick days. My concern grew as I approached the house and saw that the trucks driver's side door was standing open, and so was the front door to the house.  

I remember that walk, down the driveway to the house. The absolute silence of the world as my footsteps crunched over the gravel and dirt. The creak of each wooden step up to the small wobbly porch. The feel of the warm breeze that blew through the trailers open door, carrying with it a coppery smell. I saw mom first. I could see her through the open door, slumped down against the wall beside the couch; her knees pulled up to her chest. She was pale and wouldn't look at me, no matter how loud I called to her. She just stared straight ahead, shivering. After summoning up as much courage as I could, I stepped into the house and around the corner, and there was dad. At first, I couldn't understand what I was seeing, I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that this was really happening, that that was dad. He was on his back, on top of the dining room table. His head hung backwards off of the edge, at too sharp of an angle. His eyes rolled in their sockets before focusing on me for the briefest of moments. He tried to speak but all that came out was a sickening gurgle as blood poured from his lips and his throat... God his throat, it was gone. It was like it had been ripped away and flung across the room. Blood coated the walls and ceiling in thick dripping lines. I screamed and turned to mom, trying to shake her out of her shock or whatever was happening, but she just kept staring straight ahead, she never even acknowledged me. 

 I don't remember much after that, but they say I ran to a neighbor's house and got them to call 911. Dad was obviously dead when the ambulance and police arrived. They took mom to the hospital and tried to get her to tell them what she had seen, but I guess the shock was too deep. She wouldn’t speak; she stopped eating, stopped drinking and was eventually admitted to the psyche ward. For years, therapists tried to reach her, to help her to process and talk about what she had seen. Unfortunately, mom never spoke again.  

After the incident, I ended up moving in with my grandparents in El Paso. They had mom moved to an assisted living home an hour's drive from their house. We would go visit her two to three times a week for the first couple of years, hoping and praying that she would come back to us. But she never did. Occasionally she would whistle, but only ever one tune. Grandpa said the tune sounded familiar, but he could never place it; no one could. Eventually the visits became once a week, then every other week, once a month. By the time I was 18, I only saw mom a couple times a year for special occasions. I spent a lot of my free time in therapy, trying to deal with my trauma, but I had nightmares of my dad's face for years, still do sometimes. 

 My life with my grandparents was more comfortable than I could ever have imagined. I had good food, a warm bed every night, and I was finally in school long enough to make real, lasting friendships. And I struggled with the guilt that I was happier with my grandparents than I ever was with my parents.  

Now I'm a relatively happy, stable, and sane 35-year-old history teacher with a wife and a son of my own, despite the trauma I went through as a child. At least I thought I was sane. For the past couple weeks, I've been waking up in the middle of the night with my mother's whistle stuck in my head. On one particularly rough night, Grace told me it could be the manifestation of my guilt for not visiting mom in a while. It made sense, after all I hadn't gone to visit for the past two years. But to be honest, I didn’t feel much guilt. Maybe that made me an asshole, but I was pretty sure she didn’t even know who I was when I did visit. But, I was off work the next day, so I figured I had no excuse to not go for a visit.  

That morning, I filled my coffee cup, got Shawn off to preschool and headed for the Shady Grove care home. I still lived roughly an hour from the home, plenty of time to think on the drive. I thought about how things were when I was a kid, about mom and what she had seen... about dad. The look on his face as his loose neck swiveled toward me. What did he try to say? Who did that to him? What had mom seen? I realized my hand was shaking as I raised my coffee to my lips and did my best to clear my mind of the questions that would probably never be answered. I took a steadying breath and turned up the radio.  

Shady Grove was a very upscale assisted living home, one of the most celebrated in the state, if the banner in the lobby was to be believed.  

“Hi Susan.” I said as I approached the nurse's desk. 

The older woman with big poofy blonde hair looked up and studied me for a moment before recognition spread a smile on her face, “Jim, hi. Wow it's been a while.”  

I nodded, “Yeah well, I've been busy.” Clearing my throat I continued, “How is she?” 

Susan stood up and came around the desk shaking her head, “Oh you know her, she just sits quietly most of the time. Although some of the night staff say she has started whistling more at night lately. Come on, I'll take you to her.” 

“Really?” I asked as I followed, “How long has she been doing that for?” 

“Oh, just the past week or so.”  

That was one hell of a coincidence, I thought as we walked down the sterile white halls, the smell of soiled bed sheets, bleach, and stale body odor permeating the air. I hated this place, it felt like deaths waiting room.  

Finally, Susan brought me to a brightly lit reading room with large windows facing a garden outside. There she was, sitting slumped in her wheelchair. Her once dark brown hair now turned gray, hung down around her shoulders in tangles. I slowly walked across the room, picking up a white plastic chair on the way. Setting the chair next to her I sat down and looked her over.  

“Hey mom.” I said, touching her arm.  

She didn't look at me; she never did. Her vacant eyes stayed fixed forward. Lost in a moment, years ago.  

“Mom, it's Jim. Your son.”  

Still no reaction. I don't know why I always come here expecting anything else. I nodded, “It's okay mom, I'll just sit here with you for a while.” 

We sat and watched the butterflies in the garden for a while. Then I stood and just as I was about to leave, mom started to whistle. When I turned to look at her, I noticed something I hadn't seen before. Her eyes, while still mostly fixed straight forward, had more focus in them than I had seen in years. 

“Mom?” I asked. Bending down to her.  

She didn't answer just kept whistling and looking straight ahead, a single tear broke from her left eye and ran down her face. She was focused on something. I turned to see where she was looking. Out the window, across the garden, in a darkened upstairs window on the other side of the courtyard. At first, I thought I could see something, was it a person? I couldn't tell. But when I blinked, whatever I thought I saw was gone. 

I stopped another nurse as she passed, “Excuse me, could you tell me what's on the other side of the building there?” I asked as I pointed to the darkened window. 

“Oh, that's going to be the therapeutic wing when its finished, unfortunately the contractors are dragging their feet lately.” She answered. 

“So, it’s empty? Theres nothing or no one in there?” 

“Shouldn't be. Unless it was one of the workers.”  

I nodded and turned back to mom as she slowly stopped whistling and went back to her vacant stare. I looked back at the window again but there was nothing there. I sighed and bent down to kiss mom on the cheek. “Goodbye mom, I'll see you next time.” And with that I left Shady Grove. 

That night after dinner and putting Shawn to bed, I spoke with Grace about the visit with my mother while we washed the dishes. 

“Well, it sounds like not much has changed. Do you at least feel better after seeing her?” She asked. 

“I don't know, maybe. On the one hand it was good to see her, but...” I trailed off as I absently dried a plate. 

“But?” Prompted Grace. 

I shrugged, “But at the same time, she’s not her. Not the mother I grew up with. I keep waiting for her to snap out of it. Every time I visit, I walk in thinking maybe this time she will turn and just... speak, say something, say anything.”   

Grace put her hand on my shoulder, “I'm sorry.”  

“I know it's awful, but sometimes I wish that if she can't get better, she could just move on.” I turned to my wife. “Does that make me a monster?”  

She put down her towel and wrapped her arms around me, “No, honey. It just means you just want her to be free, whatever freedom looks like.”  

I smiled, “Sounds a lot nicer the way you say it.” 

Grace smiled back, “Well I'm a little nicer than you are.” 

We laughed and I leaned in and kissed her. And then Shawn started yelling.  

“Momma I had a bad dream!” He cried. 

Grace sighed and smiled up at me, “To be continued.” She said before turning and heading for Shawn’s room, leaving me to finish the dishes. 

 

I woke up again that night, it wasn't the whistling in my head though. You know how when you think you are alone, but then you slowly get that feeling crawling up your spine that someone somewhere is looking at you? It was like that. I sat up and looked around the room but saw only shadows. The clock on the nightstand showed 3:30AM. I lay back down and tried to get to sleep but I just tossed and turned. 

 After a while I decided to get up for a glass of water. I left my bedroom and walked down the hall past Shawns' room, his SpongeBob nightlight illuminating his room in a soft yellow glow. Down the stairs, through the front room, and into the kitchen. I downed one glass and was about to fill it again when I heard it. The whistle. Moms whistle. Only it wasn't in my head. It was on the other side of my front door.  

I froze listening to the whistle for a solid minute before it stopped. It was the exact same tune. I stepped through the house as if on autopilot and approached the front door. Was mom out there? Could she have gotten here? No, no she didn't even know where I lived. My heart was pounding as I looked through the peep hole. But, there was no one there. I pulled the curtain on the front room window aside and looked out but still, I saw nothing. Just the empty street, the neighbor's houses were all dark except for porch lights and the single streetlight on the corner. Was it just in my head? I wondered. Maybe I really was losing it.  

I went back to the kitchen and drank another half glass of water before walking back upstairs and past Shawns' room, Shawns' dark room. I stopped and walked back down the hall and into his room. I bent down next to the outlet, feeling around for the nightlight, thinking that maybe it had fallen. When I couldn't find it, I just shrugged and headed back to bed. Only when I got there, that's when I found the nightlight. It was sitting right there on my pillow. “What the hell?”  

I picked up the nightlight and looked it over, wondering how it had gotten there. I almost woke grace and asked her, but she had to perform surgery in the morning and needed her sleep. I took the nightlight and made my way back down the hall to Shawn’s room to plug it in. If he woke up without it, he would not be getting back to sleep tonight. I plugged in the light then turned and smiled as I looked down at my sleeping son. I was about to head back to my room when I noticed something. Shawns room faced the street, and through his window under the glow of the streetlight was a man. He was a tall thin man, dressed in dark clothes with a long black coat and a wide brimmed hat, concealing his face in shadow. But I could swear I saw the glint of eyes, like an animal's eyes reflected in light, and he was looking right into the window, at me. I stared back for a moment, then the man tipped his hat before turning and walking off into the darkness. 

I grabbed Shawn and took him to my room with Grace, waking her up and telling her what I had seen. 

“Grace, he was in the house I'm sure of it!” I yelled as I pulled my shotgun from the closet and loaded it.  

“Are you sure?” She asked, “Did you see him?”  

Shawn was confused and crying from being woken up and carried roughly through the house, not to mention his half-crazed father shouting and waving a gun around. 

“I didn't see him, but I know he was here, I don't know how, but I know it!” I yelled. 

“Okay.” she said putting her hands on my trembling arms, “Let's just put this down.” She said, taking the shotgun and setting it by the nightstand. “And let's call the police.”  

I nodded, realizing she was right and that I was scaring my son. 

When the sheriff arrived, I told him what had happened and he took down my statement, looking at me pretty dubiously.  

Sheriff Ward had been a longtime friend of my grandfathers; he knew them well and knew my story. 

“So, you're saying that this man broke into your house, moved your son's nightlight and then whistled at your door.” He asked, smoothing his thick white mustache. 

I crossed my arms and dropped my head; this was ridiculous. I was losing my mind. It was probably old trauma from my past rearing its head and making me see and hear things. I felt so embarrassed to have made this into such a big thing. 

Grace said, “Jim says this man was in our house, as crazy as it sounds, I believe him.” 

The Sheriff sighed, “Okay, I'll put out an apb to be on the lookout for anyone suspicious matching your description. And for the time being I'll have a car posted her in case he comes back.” 

“Thank you.” Said Grace.  

I nodded my thanks and we went back inside.  

It was nearly 6:00AM by the time we got Shawn back to bed. Grace had to leave for surgery, and it happened to be a Saturday, so I was off work. I spent the morning drinking coffee and grading papers, and around noon my long-time buddy Ben came over to see how things were going. I told him about what had happened or what I thought had happened over a few beers while Shawn and Bens kids played in the yard.  

“Shits crazy man.” Said Ben, “You think it has something to do with your dad?” 

I looked at him, “What do you mean?” 

Ben leaned back, causing my lawn chain to groan, “Well, seeing as how your dad was murdered when you were a kid, could it be possible that you are seeing things. And you’re having such an extreme reaction to it because you are afraid of being murdered yourself and leaving your son irreparably scarred the way you were?” 

I stared at him for a moment, “Since when are you a fucking psychologist?” 

He laughed, “Hey brother I just call em like I see em.”  

I sighed, “I don't know, maybe you're right, maybe I am overreacting. I should probably make an appointment to see my therapist.” 

Ben shrugged, “Not a bad idea amigo. Now pass me another beer.”  

 

That evening Grace had to work a double shift, so me and Shawn were on our own for dinner. We made homemade pizzas and watched cartoons until the little man fell asleep on the couch. I carried him to bed and tucked him in before heading back downstairs to watch reruns of the twilight zone. 

I had just sat down with my bowl of popcorn as Rod Sterling was wrapping up another episode, when I heard something hit the back door. I looked but I couldn't tell what had made the noise, so I got up and walked over to the back door. “What?” There, just outside on the ground, was Shawn's nightlight. I turned and ran upstairs as fast as I could to check on Shawn, I knew that the light was there when I tucked him in.  

When I got to his room, I saw that he was fine, he was fast asleep. I walked to my room and grabbed the shotgun before heading back downstairs. 

I flung open the door and walked out into the yard raising the shotgun, “Where are you? You son of a bitch! Come out and face me!”  

Then I heard it, a voice, a deep and raspy voice. And it was singing,  

“Oooh death 

OoOh death 

Wont you spare me over til another year” 

My heart froze, the tune... that God damn tune. It was what my mother had been whistling for the past 20 years. I turned in the direction of the voice, and the man stepped out of the shadow of a small tree near the edge of my yard, a shadow far too small to fully conceal him. He was twenty yards away when I raised my shotgun.  

“Who are you?” I yelled.  

The man laughed 

“What do you want?” I demanded. 

The man just laughed and smiled, even from that distance I could see there was something wrong with his teeth. 

“You take one more step and I'll shoot.” I shouted at him. 

He stopped and flung his arms out to the sides in a “Here I am” gesture before continuing forward.  

“I mean it, I'll kill you!” I yelled. 

But he just kept coming, so I fired. Only he wasn't where I was aiming anymore. He was off to the left, so I adjusted my aim and fired again, but he wasn't there either. He was off to the far right, so I took aim and fired again. But again, I missed and in the next moment he was right in front of me. I fell back to the ground just as one of the deputies came running around the side of the house. 

“What the hell are you shooting at?” He yelled. 

In my panic, I had forgotten about the deputy parked out front. I turned back to where the man was, but he was gone. What could I say? I couldn't very well tell him I was shooting at a ghost, even if that's what if felt like. My sanity was already up for debate as far as the sheriff's department was concerned.  

I shakily got to my feet, “Opossum, big Opossum. They like to dig through our trash.  

The deputy shook his head, “Well did you get him at least?” 

“No.” I said looking around the yard, “No, I guess not.”  

For the rest of the night, I sat up in Shawn’s room, my shotgun across my lap, for all the good it had done. When Grace finally made it home, it was nearly 4:30AM. I told her what I had seen and from the look on her face, I could see that she wanted to believe me. But even I knew how it sounded.  

It took some doing but I managed to convince her that maybe I just needed a few days on my own to get my head straight. That morning, she packed up bags for her and Shawn and went to stay at her mother's house for a couple days. I stood in the driveway and waved them off before heading back inside for my car keys. I needed to take another trip to Shady Grove. 

When I arrived, I found mom in the same brightly lit reading room, facing out the same window. Again, I pulled over a chair and sat next to her. 

“Mom, it's Jim. I really need you to talk to me.” I could hear the desperation in my own voice as I pleaded for her to talk. 

“What happened to dad?” I asked, leaving the chair and kneeling down in front of her, “What did you see? Was it a tall thin man?” 

I was answered only by silence and the same vacant stare she always had. 

“He was in my house god dammit!” I erupted. “My son, your grandson, may be in danger! Fucking say something!”  

“Sir.” said one of the nurses approaching from behind me. “You’re gonna need to lower your voice or...” 

“Yeah.” I said interrupting, “Sorry, I was just leaving.” 

I stood and started for the door, then a thought occurred to me. I turned and walked back to stand next to mom. 

“Ooh death.” I began to sing, “OoOh death.” 

And then something happened, something I never thought I would see. Mom slowly turned her head, her eyes widening as tears began to pour down her face. Her lip quivered as she took a sharp inhale of breath, and then she began screaming. Nurses quickly gathered around, pushing me back and taking my screaming mother away. 

30 minutes later, an orderly came and found me sitting numbly in the reading room. “Sir?” 

“Yes?” I said standing up, “How is she?” 

“She’s calmed down now, we’ve given her a mild sedative, she wants to speak to you.” 

The words hit me like a freight train; “She wants to speak to you.” The words I had prayed to hear for the past 20 years, but had given up on. I wordlessly followed the orderly to her room and there she was. Her eyes fluttered up to me as I stepped through the door. Tears burned in mine as she tried to smile. “Hi mom.” I said. She weakly waved me closer, and I knelt down by her side, taking her hand. 

“Jimmy.” She said, her voice was weak and small with disuse.  

“I'm here mom.” I said. Leaning close. 

She leaned forward and whispered in my ear, “He’s coming for you, now.” She smiled sadly as tears ran down her face. 

“Who is he?” I asked. 

She shook her head, “Run if you want, hide if you can. It won't matter in the end.” 

“What are you saying? Run and hide from who?” 

“Find your father's family, they will tell you. He didn't know until it was too late.” 

“Tell me what?” I asked “I don't understand. Who is he?” 

She smiled that same sad smile and put her hand on my cheek, “He’s death.” 

And with that she turned away and closed her eyes. I tried to wake her, but the nurses quickly ushered me out. “She needs her rest.” one of them said, “We will call you if anything changes.” ",2,1769242634.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False
1qlhgmp,https://v.redd.it/00sgimm3a9fg1,☀️Shanghai City Walk,"City walk stop #1 starts at a tiny Japanese café in Shanghai.

The sun finally shows up after days away, and suddenly the streets feel softer.

Lunch is a bowl of signature crab roe noodles—rich, comforting, and just right.

Then a long-overdue brunch with a friend, catching up slowly, properly.

The afternoon begins with a special coffee, like hitting reset.

Wandering between art spaces and modern architecture, I start to understand Shanghai’s contradictions—

and why that’s exactly what makes it so unique.

1qlhgjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITManagers/comments/1qlhgjw/is_our_it_department_normal_or_am_i_just_slowly/,"Is our IT department “normal”, or am I just slowly losing my mind? (Rant)","Hey all first thing I want to be honest with is that It took me like 2 hours to write a rant about our operations but then I figured that AI would make it more suitable for reddit so I put my text trough copilot and it came out way better so this text is modified by copilot. Which is why it might seem like AI wirtten but its so much better than what I wrote because Im not native English speaker and copilot just does my rant better:

  
I’m posting this because I honestly need to know whether our IT support situation is anywhere near normal, or if we’re living in some corporate fever dream. I’m also on the edge of burning out because the company keeps piling more responsibilities on us without adding a single new resource. Our IT manager has tried to explain this to the CIO, but the guy either doesn’t have time or doesn’t care.

**The environment:**  
We’re a tech manufacturing company with \~400 blue‑collar workers and \~250–300 engineers. We run our own server rooms, \~100 virtual servers, hybrid AD, our own network, our own device installations, custom integrations between servers and production machines — the whole circus. If our IT team disappeared tomorrow, the company would collapse within a week or two. No outsourcing partner could pick this up fast enough.

**The team:**  
We are *five* people.

1. **The ultra‑sysadmin.** The guy is a genius. Reads Microsoft documentation like it’s morning coffee. Handles infra, networking, backups, everything. But he’s so fast and so smart that he doesn’t understand that the rest of us are not built like him. He keeps creating new tools and systems without documentation and expects everyone to magically know how to use them by just quickly showing ""how to"".
2. **The “not‑so‑sysadmin” sysadmin.** Been here two years. Doesn’t learn anything unless explicitly told. Needs constant reminders to even check tickets. Has taken two remote days per week and somehow has only four tickets assigned (pretty sure hes not doing them actively). Not malicious, just… not suited for this environment.
3. **The office IT guy.** Handles laptops and meeting rooms. Refuses to learn anything new (Intune, Entra, firewalls, you name it). Has been doing the same job for 15 years and guards his job description like a dragon guards treasure. Also takes two remote days a week and often uses overtime to take Mondays off after drinking weekends. Meanwhile the rest of us handle his on‑site tasks. He also blocked our IT manager from outsourcing PC preinstallation because “everyone needs special software anyway”. So now *nobody* gets ready‑to‑use devices.
4. **The production support guy.** Solid worker. Does what he’s told, handles bulk installs, backups, restores. Not very innovative, but reliable. Doesn’t take on new systems unless explicitly ordered to, which I think is fine considering amount of work we have to do.
5. **Me.** 12 years in production IT. I handle the complex stuff, the projects, the integrations, the weird failures. I’ve learned firewalls, Intune, network documentation tools — whatever the environment has needed. But I’m burned out on basic tickets. If I get one more “production screen is flickering” ticket, I might scream. I’m studying IT management because I need a way out and at same time I want to be able to discuss about our problems with other ways than just complaining.

**The real problem:**  
Our ticket load is insane. Engineers don’t send “simple” tickets — they solve those themselves. Every ticket we get is basically a mini‑project:

* “Create a new system.”
* “Fix this custom server.”
* "" We created powerapp function for cheap android phones and we need 20 devices by next week. You know what android model is good, right?”
* “Build a new monitoring system for factory safety.”

And these come in as if they were trivial tasks.

Only me and the ultra‑sysadmin can actually build new things. The others either can’t, won’t, or don’t have the skills. So everything funnels to us.

Production IT is drowning. Office IT has like 4 tickets. Production has 40. And we’re blamed for “not prioritizing”. We have been suggested that we should share the load, but each of ours roles contain so much detail that we simply cannot do each others work.

**The organization sees us as ‘the guys who fix computers’.**  
They don’t understand that if we fall behind:

* production devices won’t be recoverable
* customer requirements won’t be met
* cybersecurity will suffer
* and eventually the whole company will feel it
* ... Actually they already feel it, but all they know is blaming us not prioritizing.

Our team is getting frustrated with each other because the system is setting us up to fail. And honestly, I’m starting to think the only real solution is hiring more people — but nobody above us seems to care. We are tight on money right now so thats obviously a reason they are using now, but they didnt bother with our resources even when we had loads of money.

  
I’ve been studying ICT management, and honestly it’s making me even more depressed — because now I fully realize the problem isn’t just our department. The entire company should be treating IT as a strategic resource, not just a support function. It's just that we are ones to blame.

1qlhgej,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qlhgej,Got scammed by an instagram clothing brand,"So there’s a brand called Legdays.in on insta with approx 1659 followers and 23 posts. So apparently i was searching for a decent pair of baggy tracks for gym and this brands reels/ads caught my attention, at the time there was an offer ongoing 2 baggy tracks for 1499. So i made a purchase for 2 pairs ( one was a special edition & another was basic ) so the total cost came upto ₹1550, as you can see it was a prepaid order. So i was in a dilemma of whether  the size ( i purchased M as per the size chart on their website ) would fit me well or not, i’m 6’1. So i replied to their instagram story and they reverted back quick enough. They sent me a vn that “ sir if you’re 6’1 XL size would fit you well and if you’ve already placed an order rest assured just confirm your size with me here and i’ll modify the shipment from my end and XL would be delivered to you ! “ , hearing him say that i was actually quite impressed by this level of service by such a new brand ! but again guess when i texted him that “ okay i’ll go with your recommendation size XL “

now even after a day he wasn’t seeing my dm, i even called and whatsapp on their number mentioned on the site still no response…. and after a whole day when my order got shipped he texted “ really sorry sir send your no. you’ll get a call tomorrow “ 

i shared my no.. and still nothing changed, no calls no assurance. and then 2 days later when i texted again he replied “ sir aapko XL hi deliver hoga wo M kikha hai kyuki apne wo select kia tha “ 

atp i was still fine let’s see. but but guess what when the order arrived it was M and even worse it was totally a different pair of colors ( coffee brown & camel brown ) i was like wtf ! i texted him immediately but he didn’t respond for the next few hours, later when i got frustrated i checked his instagram posts and found that few people too got wrong orders and were asking for an exchange in the comments, naturally i to commented there to get his attention, and it did work he dm’ed me with a vn “ sir comments krne se kya exchange ho jayega ? “ and also found out he deleted all the negative comments from his posts ! now i wonder if he’s even gonna return the money or even exchange the product, it’s been already 3 days since the delivery and he’s not responding ! 

Please help of suggest what can be done here ! 

Also i found out his personal id and found out he is a guy from DU and must have started this as a startup , but apparently this made me more sure that he’s not serious about his business. ",5,1769242545.0,scamindia,0,0.86,False
1qlhgau,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qlhgau/the_sins_of_fathers/,The Sins of Fathers,"“The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself.” Ezekiel 18:20 

My father was a good man. We were poor growing up, but he did the best he could, working odd jobs here and there to provide for mother and me. We did a lot of moving around when I was younger, lots of new towns, a new school every year or two. My mother used to say we moved so much because, “Daddy got a new better paying job.” in whatever town we would be moving to next. That was always the excuse but by the time I turned twelve, I had stopped believing the recurring lie. Despite dad’s “better job”, we never seemed to have much money. For most of my young life, we lived off the barest of means. In our home, a bologna sandwich was considered to be doing well. 

 I never really learned why we moved around so much. I always had the feeling dad was chasing something or maybe running from something. Unlike mom's usual excuse, dad would never answer when I would ask why we had to leave again; he usually wouldn't even look at me. He would come home from work one evening and loudly announce, “Time to go!” and mom and I would quickly pack up whatever shitty little apartment we happen to be staying in, and we would be on the road that later that night. 

That was my life for 14 years. Then one day I came home from school and dad's pickup was already home. We were staying in a rundown singlewide trailer house just outside of Joplin, Missouri. It was almost unheard of for dad to be home early on a weekday. I mean sure, there were times he would be laid off from wherever he was working at the time, but he would usually scramble to go job hunting that day, and he almost never took sick days. My concern grew as I approached the house and saw that the trucks driver's side door was standing open, and so was the front door to the house.  

I remember that walk, down the driveway to the house. The absolute silence of the world as my footsteps crunched over the gravel and dirt. The creak of each wooden step up to the small wobbly porch. The feel of the warm breeze that blew through the trailers open door, carrying with it a coppery smell. I saw mom first. I could see her through the open door, slumped down against the wall beside the couch; her knees pulled up to her chest. She was pale and wouldn't look at me, no matter how loud I called to her. She just stared straight ahead, shivering. After summoning up as much courage as I could, I stepped into the house and around the corner, and there was dad. At first, I couldn't understand what I was seeing, I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that this was really happening, that that was dad. He was on his back, on top of the dining room table. His head hung backwards off of the edge, at too sharp of an angle. His eyes rolled in their sockets before focusing on me for the briefest of moments. He tried to speak but all that came out was a sickening gurgle as blood poured from his lips and his throat... God his throat, it was gone. It was like it had been ripped away and flung across the room. Blood coated the walls and ceiling in thick dripping lines. I screamed and turned to mom, trying to shake her out of her shock or whatever was happening, but she just kept staring straight ahead, she never even acknowledged me. 

 I don't remember much after that, but they say I ran to a neighbor's house and got them to call 911. Dad was obviously dead when the ambulance and police arrived. They took mom to the hospital and tried to get her to tell them what she had seen, but I guess the shock was too deep. She wouldn’t speak; she stopped eating, stopped drinking and was eventually admitted to the psyche ward. For years, therapists tried to reach her, to help her to process and talk about what she had seen. Unfortunately, mom never spoke again.  

After the incident, I ended up moving in with my grandparents in El Paso. They had mom moved to an assisted living home an hour's drive from their house. We would go visit her two to three times a week for the first couple of years, hoping and praying that she would come back to us. But she never did. Occasionally she would whistle, but only ever one tune. Grandpa said the tune sounded familiar, but he could never place it; no one could. Eventually the visits became once a week, then every other week, once a month. By the time I was 18, I only saw mom a couple times a year for special occasions. I spent a lot of my free time in therapy, trying to deal with my trauma, but I had nightmares of my dad's face for years, still do sometimes. 

 My life with my grandparents was more comfortable than I could ever have imagined. I had good food, a warm bed every night, and I was finally in school long enough to make real, lasting friendships. And I struggled with the guilt that I was happier with my grandparents than I ever was with my parents.  

Now I'm a relatively happy, stable, and sane 35-year-old history teacher with a wife and a son of my own, despite the trauma I went through as a child. At least I thought I was sane. For the past couple weeks, I've been waking up in the middle of the night with my mother's whistle stuck in my head. On one particularly rough night, Grace told me it could be the manifestation of my guilt for not visiting mom in a while. It made sense, after all I hadn't gone to visit for the past two years. But to be honest, I didn’t feel much guilt. Maybe that made me an asshole, but I was pretty sure she didn’t even know who I was when I did visit. But, I was off work the next day, so I figured I had no excuse to not go for a visit.  

That morning, I filled my coffee cup, got Shawn off to preschool and headed for the Shady Grove care home. I still lived roughly an hour from the home, plenty of time to think on the drive. I thought about how things were when I was a kid, about mom and what she had seen... about dad. The look on his face as his loose neck swiveled toward me. What did he try to say? Who did that to him? What had mom seen? I realized my hand was shaking as I raised my coffee to my lips and did my best to clear my mind of the questions that would probably never be answered. I took a steadying breath and turned up the radio.  

Shady Grove was a very upscale assisted living home, one of the most celebrated in the state, if the banner in the lobby was to be believed.  

“Hi Susan.” I said as I approached the nurse's desk. 

The older woman with big poofy blonde hair looked up and studied me for a moment before recognition spread a smile on her face, “Jim, hi. Wow it's been a while.”  

I nodded, “Yeah well, I've been busy.” Clearing my throat I continued, “How is she?” 

Susan stood up and came around the desk shaking her head, “Oh you know her, she just sits quietly most of the time. Although some of the night staff say she has started whistling more at night lately. Come on, I'll take you to her.” 

“Really?” I asked as I followed, “How long has she been doing that for?” 

“Oh, just the past week or so.”  

That was one hell of a coincidence, I thought as we walked down the sterile white halls, the smell of soiled bed sheets, bleach, and stale body odor permeating the air. I hated this place, it felt like deaths waiting room.  

Finally, Susan brought me to a brightly lit reading room with large windows facing a garden outside. There she was, sitting slumped in her wheelchair. Her once dark brown hair now turned gray, hung down around her shoulders in tangles. I slowly walked across the room, picking up a white plastic chair on the way. Setting the chair next to her I sat down and looked her over.  

“Hey mom.” I said, touching her arm.  

She didn't look at me; she never did. Her vacant eyes stayed fixed forward. Lost in a moment, years ago.  

“Mom, it's Jim. Your son.”  

Still no reaction. I don't know why I always come here expecting anything else. I nodded, “It's okay mom, I'll just sit here with you for a while.” 

We sat and watched the butterflies in the garden for a while. Then I stood and just as I was about to leave, mom started to whistle. When I turned to look at her, I noticed something I hadn't seen before. Her eyes, while still mostly fixed straight forward, had more focus in them than I had seen in years. 

“Mom?” I asked. Bending down to her.  

She didn't answer just kept whistling and looking straight ahead, a single tear broke from her left eye and ran down her face. She was focused on something. I turned to see where she was looking. Out the window, across the garden, in a darkened upstairs window on the other side of the courtyard. At first, I thought I could see something, was it a person? I couldn't tell. But when I blinked, whatever I thought I saw was gone. 

I stopped another nurse as she passed, “Excuse me, could you tell me what's on the other side of the building there?” I asked as I pointed to the darkened window. 

“Oh, that's going to be the therapeutic wing when its finished, unfortunately the contractors are dragging their feet lately.” She answered. 

“So, it’s empty? Theres nothing or no one in there?” 

“Shouldn't be. Unless it was one of the workers.”  

I nodded and turned back to mom as she slowly stopped whistling and went back to her vacant stare. I looked back at the window again but there was nothing there. I sighed and bent down to kiss mom on the cheek. “Goodbye mom, I'll see you next time.” And with that I left Shady Grove. 

That night after dinner and putting Shawn to bed, I spoke with Grace about the visit with my mother while we washed the dishes. 

“Well, it sounds like not much has changed. Do you at least feel better after seeing her?” She asked. 

“I don't know, maybe. On the one hand it was good to see her, but...” I trailed off as I absently dried a plate. 

“But?” Prompted Grace. 

I shrugged, “But at the same time, she’s not her. Not the mother I grew up with. I keep waiting for her to snap out of it. Every time I visit, I walk in thinking maybe this time she will turn and just... speak, say something, say anything.”   

Grace put her hand on my shoulder, “I'm sorry.”  

“I know it's awful, but sometimes I wish that if she can't get better, she could just move on.” I turned to my wife. “Does that make me a monster?”  

She put down her towel and wrapped her arms around me, “No, honey. It just means you just want her to be free, whatever freedom looks like.”  

I smiled, “Sounds a lot nicer the way you say it.” 

Grace smiled back, “Well I'm a little nicer than you are.” 

We laughed and I leaned in and kissed her. And then Shawn started yelling.  

“Momma I had a bad dream!” He cried. 

Grace sighed and smiled up at me, “To be continued.” She said before turning and heading for Shawn’s room, leaving me to finish the dishes. 

 

I woke up again that night, it wasn't the whistling in my head though. You know how when you think you are alone, but then you slowly get that feeling crawling up your spine that someone somewhere is looking at you? It was like that. I sat up and looked around the room but saw only shadows. The clock on the nightstand showed 3:30AM. I lay back down and tried to get to sleep but I just tossed and turned. 

 After a while I decided to get up for a glass of water. I left my bedroom and walked down the hall past Shawns' room, his SpongeBob nightlight illuminating his room in a soft yellow glow. Down the stairs, through the front room, and into the kitchen. I downed one glass and was about to fill it again when I heard it. The whistle. Moms whistle. Only it wasn't in my head. It was on the other side of my front door.  

I froze listening to the whistle for a solid minute before it stopped. It was the exact same tune. I stepped through the house as if on autopilot and approached the front door. Was mom out there? Could she have gotten here? No, no she didn't even know where I lived. My heart was pounding as I looked through the peep hole. But, there was no one there. I pulled the curtain on the front room window aside and looked out but still, I saw nothing. Just the empty street, the neighbor's houses were all dark except for porch lights and the single streetlight on the corner. Was it just in my head? I wondered. Maybe I really was losing it.  

I went back to the kitchen and drank another half glass of water before walking back upstairs and past Shawns' room, Shawns' dark room. I stopped and walked back down the hall and into his room. I bent down next to the outlet, feeling around for the nightlight, thinking that maybe it had fallen. When I couldn't find it, I just shrugged and headed back to bed. Only when I got there, that's when I found the nightlight. It was sitting right there on my pillow. “What the hell?”  

I picked up the nightlight and looked it over, wondering how it had gotten there. I almost woke grace and asked her, but she had to perform surgery in the morning and needed her sleep. I took the nightlight and made my way back down the hall to Shawn’s room to plug it in. If he woke up without it, he would not be getting back to sleep tonight. I plugged in the light then turned and smiled as I looked down at my sleeping son. I was about to head back to my room when I noticed something. Shawns room faced the street, and through his window under the glow of the streetlight was a man. He was a tall thin man, dressed in dark clothes with a long black coat and a wide brimmed hat, concealing his face in shadow. But I could swear I saw the glint of eyes, like an animal's eyes reflected in light, and he was looking right into the window, at me. I stared back for a moment, then the man tipped his hat before turning and walking off into the darkness. 

I grabbed Shawn and took him to my room with Grace, waking her up and telling her what I had seen. 

“Grace, he was in the house I'm sure of it!” I yelled as I pulled my shotgun from the closet and loaded it.  

“Are you sure?” She asked, “Did you see him?”  

Shawn was confused and crying from being woken up and carried roughly through the house, not to mention his half-crazed father shouting and waving a gun around. 

“I didn't see him, but I know he was here, I don't know how, but I know it!” I yelled. 

“Okay.” she said putting her hands on my trembling arms, “Let's just put this down.” She said, taking the shotgun and setting it by the nightstand. “And let's call the police.”  

I nodded, realizing she was right and that I was scaring my son. 

When the sheriff arrived, I told him what had happened and he took down my statement, looking at me pretty dubiously.  

Sheriff Ward had been a longtime friend of my grandfathers; he knew them well and knew my story. 

“So, you're saying that this man broke into your house, moved your son's nightlight and then whistled at your door.” He asked, smoothing his thick white mustache. 

I crossed my arms and dropped my head; this was ridiculous. I was losing my mind. It was probably old trauma from my past rearing its head and making me see and hear things. I felt so embarrassed to have made this into such a big thing. 

Grace said, “Jim says this man was in our house, as crazy as it sounds, I believe him.” 

The Sheriff sighed, “Okay, I'll put out an apb to be on the lookout for anyone suspicious matching your description. And for the time being I'll have a car posted her in case he comes back.” 

“Thank you.” Said Grace.  

I nodded my thanks and we went back inside.  

It was nearly 6:00AM by the time we got Shawn back to bed. Grace had to leave for surgery, and it happened to be a Saturday, so I was off work. I spent the morning drinking coffee and grading papers, and around noon my long-time buddy Ben came over to see how things were going. I told him about what had happened or what I thought had happened over a few beers while Shawn and Bens kids played in the yard.  

“Shits crazy man.” Said Ben, “You think it has something to do with your dad?” 

I looked at him, “What do you mean?” 

Ben leaned back, causing my lawn chain to groan, “Well, seeing as how your dad was murdered when you were a kid, could it be possible that you are seeing things. And you’re having such an extreme reaction to it because you are afraid of being murdered yourself and leaving your son irreparably scarred the way you were?” 

I stared at him for a moment, “Since when are you a fucking psychologist?” 

He laughed, “Hey brother I just call em like I see em.”  

I sighed, “I don't know, maybe you're right, maybe I am overreacting. I should probably make an appointment to see my therapist.” 

Ben shrugged, “Not a bad idea amigo. Now pass me another beer.”  

 

That evening Grace had to work a double shift, so me and Shawn were on our own for dinner. We made homemade pizzas and watched cartoons until the little man fell asleep on the couch. I carried him to bed and tucked him in before heading back downstairs to watch reruns of the twilight zone. 

I had just sat down with my bowl of popcorn as Rod Sterling was wrapping up another episode, when I heard something hit the back door. I looked but I couldn't tell what had made the noise, so I got up and walked over to the back door. “What?” There, just outside on the ground, was Shawn's nightlight. I turned and ran upstairs as fast as I could to check on Shawn, I knew that the light was there when I tucked him in.  

When I got to his room, I saw that he was fine, he was fast asleep. I walked to my room and grabbed the shotgun before heading back downstairs. 

I flung open the door and walked out into the yard raising the shotgun, “Where are you? You son of a bitch! Come out and face me!”  

Then I heard it, a voice, a deep and raspy voice. And it was singing,  

“Oooh death 

OoOh death 

Wont you spare me over til another year” 

My heart froze, the tune... that God damn tune. It was what my mother had been whistling for the past 20 years. I turned in the direction of the voice, and the man stepped out of the shadow of a small tree near the edge of my yard, a shadow far too small to fully conceal him. He was twenty yards away when I raised my shotgun.  

“Who are you?” I yelled.  

The man laughed 

“What do you want?” I demanded. 

The man just laughed and smiled, even from that distance I could see there was something wrong with his teeth. 

“You take one more step and I'll shoot.” I shouted at him. 

He stopped and flung his arms out to the sides in a “Here I am” gesture before continuing forward.  

“I mean it, I'll kill you!” I yelled. 

But he just kept coming, so I fired. Only he wasn't where I was aiming anymore. He was off to the left, so I adjusted my aim and fired again, but he wasn't there either. He was off to the far right, so I took aim and fired again. But again, I missed and in the next moment he was right in front of me. I fell back to the ground just as one of the deputies came running around the side of the house. 

“What the hell are you shooting at?” He yelled. 

In my panic, I had forgotten about the deputy parked out front. I turned back to where the man was, but he was gone. What could I say? I couldn't very well tell him I was shooting at a ghost, even if that's what if felt like. My sanity was already up for debate as far as the sheriff's department was concerned.  

I shakily got to my feet, “Opossum, big Opossum. They like to dig through our trash.  

The deputy shook his head, “Well did you get him at least?” 

“No.” I said looking around the yard, “No, I guess not.”  

For the rest of the night, I sat up in Shawn’s room, my shotgun across my lap, for all the good it had done. When Grace finally made it home, it was nearly 4:30AM. I told her what I had seen and from the look on her face, I could see that she wanted to believe me. But even I knew how it sounded.  

It took some doing but I managed to convince her that maybe I just needed a few days on my own to get my head straight. That morning, she packed up bags for her and Shawn and went to stay at her mother's house for a couple days. I stood in the driveway and waved them off before heading back inside for my car keys. I needed to take another trip to Shady Grove. 

When I arrived, I found mom in the same brightly lit reading room, facing out the same window. Again, I pulled over a chair and sat next to her. 

“Mom, it's Jim. I really need you to talk to me.” I could hear the desperation in my own voice as I pleaded for her to talk. 

“What happened to dad?” I asked, leaving the chair and kneeling down in front of her, “What did you see? Was it a tall thin man?” 

I was answered only by silence and the same vacant stare she always had. 

“He was in my house god dammit!” I erupted. “My son, your grandson, may be in danger! Fucking say something!”  

“Sir.” said one of the nurses approaching from behind me. “You’re gonna need to lower your voice or...” 

“Yeah.” I said interrupting, “Sorry, I was just leaving.” 

I stood and started for the door, then a thought occurred to me. I turned and walked back to stand next to mom. 

“Ooh death.” I began to sing, “OoOh death.” 

And then something happened, something I never thought I would see. Mom slowly turned her head, her eyes widening as tears began to pour down her face. Her lip quivered as she took a sharp inhale of breath, and then she began screaming. Nurses quickly gathered around, pushing me back and taking my screaming mother away. 

30 minutes later, an orderly came and found me sitting numbly in the reading room. “Sir?” 

“Yes?” I said standing up, “How is she?” 

“She’s calmed down now, we’ve given her a mild sedative, she wants to speak to you.” 

The words hit me like a freight train; “She wants to speak to you.” The words I had prayed to hear for the past 20 years, but had given up on. I wordlessly followed the orderly to her room and there she was. Her eyes fluttered up to me as I stepped through the door. Tears burned in mine as she tried to smile. “Hi mom.” I said. She weakly waved me closer, and I knelt down by her side, taking her hand. 

“Jimmy.” She said, her voice was weak and small with disuse.  

“I'm here mom.” I said. Leaning close. 

She leaned forward and whispered in my ear, “He’s coming for you, now.” She smiled sadly as tears ran down her face. 

“Who is he?” I asked. 

She shook her head, “Run if you want, hide if you can. It won't matter in the end.” 

“What are you saying? Run and hide from who?” 

“Find your father's family, they will tell you. He didn't know until it was too late.” 

“Tell me what?” I asked “I don't understand. Who is he?” 

She smiled that same sad smile and put her hand on my cheek, “He’s death.” 

And with that she turned away and closed her eyes. I tried to wake her, but the nurses quickly ushered me out. “She needs her rest.” one of them said, “We will call you if anything changes.” ",3,1769242535.0,nosleep,0,0.72,False
