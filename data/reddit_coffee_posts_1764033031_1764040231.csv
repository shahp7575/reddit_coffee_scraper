cut to us meeting for chai because coffee is apparently “too formal”. cute moment. he’s staring, smiling, doing the whole shy boy act. everything was fine until he suddenly drops this line. you’re really pretty but i don’t date trans women. it’s just a preference.

and i swear the way he said it felt less like a boundary and more like he was scared someone might hear him admit he liked me. private me was fine. public me was too risky.

this is where i get confused. nobody owes me attraction and i’m not sitting here begging for validation. but in india a lot of men are attracted to trans women in private and terrified of being seen with us outside. they hide behind the word preference like it’s some spiritual truth when half the time it’s just fear of society aunties uncles bros memes all of it.

if your preference flips the moment you step out into daylight it isn’t a preference. it’s social panic.

1p61ijk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jibreal_Khan/comments/1p61ijk/how_to_fix_porn_induced_erectile_dysfunction/,How To Fix Porn Induced Erectile Dysfunction.,"There are a number of reasons why watching porn causes a person to have erectile dysfunction. And when I use the term erectile dysfunction, I mean that the person is unable to get an erection while he is being intimate with a real person. This is quite damaging to the self-image of the person that you are being intimate with and damaging to your own confidence as a man, knowing that you cannot satisfy the needs of your spouse.

**Reason - 1**  
The first reason why porn causes an erectile dysfunction is simply due to the fact that it is significantly more stimulating than real life intimacy. Think about what an average porn session might look like, you are browsing through dozens of naked women, different shapes and sizes, doing absolutely whatever you can think off. This releases an absurd about of dopamine into your brain and causes you to get desensitized to the lower dopamine release from real life intimacy.

**Reason - 2**  
The second reason that contributes to erectile dysfunction is that fact that most people when they are viewing porn, they are masturbating to it, and it is usually with a firm grip. What this does is that, once, again it desensitizes your genitals to all other forms of softer touch.

**Reason - 3**  
The third reason why you might experience erectile dysfunction is due to you having developed fetishes. Years of watching porn and pursuing strange and novel experiences has led you to develop fetishes. Not your brain has been rewired to only associates those strange sexual acts with pleasure. All other forms of intimacy are no longer that exciting to your brain.

**Can you recover?**  
The good news is that you can fully recover from a porn induced erectile dysfunction. Your brain has the ability to rewire itself and this is known as neuroplasticity. With the right protocols you can bring your brain back to it default settings and heal your erectile dysfunction.

**How long does it take to recover?**  
The answer to this question entirely depends on how bad the damage is. If you have been watching porn for decades and you have been using it multiple times a day, then obvious, it is going to take a bit longer to recover. Additionally, if you strictly adhere to the protocols that I am going to describe, then your recovery is going to accelerate significantly. Lastly, your time for recovery, strongly depends on how many relapses you have. If you are still relapsing every few days or every week, then recovery is going to take far longer.

But let's say you are strictly adhering to all the protocols that I describe, and you have a good system in place that prevents you from relapsing, then I would say that most people can make a full recovery in 1-6 months (just my opinion).

# The foundation

This part of the protocol is going to sound very cliche, yet it something that plays a critical role in your recovery. These are your 3 core pillars of health: your sleep, your diet and exercise. Each of these things significantly impact your brain health and its ability to rewire itself.

**Sleep**  
If you are someone who has terrible sleep hygiene: you go to bed at random times, you don’t get adequate hours of sleep, you view bright lights from your cellphone or laptop before bed, you don’t get enough sunlight during the day, you have stimulants like coffee or energy drinks close to bedtime, then guess what, your sleep quality is going to be quite terrible and a result your recovery is going to be rather slow.

Additionally, poor sleep quality can also put you at risk of relapsing, because sleep has shown to play a significant role when it comes to impulse control and if your impulse control is compromised due to poor sleep, then you are putting yourself in a pretty vulnerable position.

If you are someone who is really looking to optimize their sleep, I would highly recommend that you watch one of Andrew Huberman’s podcasts on sleep optimization. It covers all things that you need to know in order to have high quality sleep. Things like: What time to eat? What time to view sunlight? How long to view sunlight? what time to avoid light?

**Diet**  
Recovery happens when your brain stops receiving hyper stimulation and in the absence of hyperstimulation, it begins to recalibrate itself. One of the ways it does so, is by improving the sensitivity and the number of its dopamine receptors to now accommodate for the fact that there is no longer that flood of dopamine coming in from pornography. However, If you are someone that consumes a lot of processed food. Things like chocolates, burgers, soda, chips etc. Then you might be greatly slowing down your recovery. That’s because you are flooding your brain with dopamine and now it doesn’t get the chance to recalibrate itself.

You don’t want to just quit one addiction and replace it with another addiction. You want to give your brain a window during which it is not being bombarded with hyperstimulation. Additionally, another property of fast food is that it generates cravings for instant pleasure. You might have noticed this, each time you consume highly processed food, like a chocolate cake, your cravings for sex just skyrocket and this puts you in quite a vulnerable position and could lead to a relapse.

What I would recommend is that you really focus on cleaning out your diet. Remove all processed food from it and replace it with whole natural single ingredient food. Things like meat, eggs, honey, dates, fruits, vegetables. These are quality ingredients that assist in healing your brain rather than help destroy it.

**Exercise**  
Exercise is not just about shaping muscles, losing weight, or improving athletic performance. When you exercise and really get that sweat going, then you brain is soaked in a cocktail of neurochemicals that are just so nourishing for it.

Exercise is not only going to help your brain rewire faster and heal your erectile dysfunction, but it is also going fill the void that was left behind by porn and it absolutely essential to fill this void with healthy sources of dopamine, else you are going to be vulnerable to relapses.

# Speeding up your recovery

Once you are no longer relapsing and you have your 3 core pillars of health fixed. Your diet is good, your sleep is good, and you are working out consistently. Then you are on your way to recover successfully from erectile dysfunction. It might take a couple of months, so just stick to your healthy habits and trust the process.

**Signs that you have recovered.**  
One way that you can get some sort of a hint that your erectile dysfunction has been cured is that fact that you will start getting morning wood and you will get frequent erections even at times when you are not looking at something sexually arousing.

So don’t try to see if your erectile dysfunction is cured by looking at porn of hypersexualized images, I have seen people try this time and time again and it just ends up in relapses and undoing your progress.

I am now going to tell you about 2 tools, that in my opinion, will significantly speed up your recovery. It might just take you half or even a third of time to recover if you incorporate these tools in your life.

**Tool 1 - Fasting**  
The first tool is fasting. Going without food for a duration of time has shown to significantly boost neuroplasticity and this allows your brain to recover much faster.

The reason why fasting is so effective is because when you voluntarily deprive your body of food, then it switches its source of energy and it starts using your fat as fuel. When this energy switch happens, your body gets the message that ‘there is a scarcity of resources’ and this causes it to start cleaning itself and burning of dysfunctional cells as a source of energy. This process is known as autophagy and fasting plays a key role in promoting it.

Additionally, fasting promotes something called neurogenesis, which is the creation of new neurons. This combination of autophagy and neurogenesis is vital for rewiring your brain and with fasting you can accelerate both these mechanisms.

**Tool 2 - Ketogenic Diet**  
Now fasting is great, but you can’t fast forever 24 hours day, 7 days a week. Or perhaps you are someone who is on the skinny side of things or you are someone who really cares about his performance in the gym or there could be many other reasons why you are not looking forward to the idea of fasting.

However, you can still get the benefits of fasting: the autophagy and neurogenesis by following a fasting mimicking diet, which is called the ‘ketogenic diet’. You might have come across it in passing, it seems to have picked up some steam in communities centered around weight loss. But it is also just a fantastic tool when it come to getting the benefits of fasting, without actually fasting. To put it simply, a ketogenic diet is when you consume little carbs, typically between 20-50 gms and mainly consume fats and proteins.

**To the skeptics**  
Now some of you are probably skeptical about the effectiveness of intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet, especially when it comes to overcoming porn addiction and, to be fair, there hasn’t been a relevant study done on the impact on ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting on porn addiction.

However, there are studies that have shown that the ketogenic diet has a positive impact on substance use disorders. There are studies that show that ketogenic diet helps reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. And lastly, there is a study that shows that ketogenic diet also reduces cravings for alcohol.

So granted that none of these things are actually porn. However, these substances behave very similar to porn, meaning they release large amounts of dopamine and are addictive. It is my hypothesis, based on my experience working with dozens of porn addicts, that ketogenic diet could be a potential tool that helps rewire the brain from porn addiction and reduce cravings for porn.

But when I do my feelings are so strong too soon. Idk what to do. Even right now at my internship, I see this really cute girl.

1. I saw her going into the elevator with another intern, probably to grab coffee. And I lost it, I was so furious I couldn't focus at work. It was like someone dropped a weight on my heart.

2. I am thinking about her every moment when she's in. Hoping she comes to my desk. If she doesn't I end up texting her to see if she wants to go get fresh air or something. just excuses to talk to her.

3. I'm so worried I can't tell what she's want. We talk great and laugh together, but I don't even know if she has a boyfriend. We've talked a fair amount and I haven't heard about one. Can't figure if I should back off or try to approach her more often.

4. I can't stop thinking about her, she can dictate my mood unknowingly by how much attention she gives me. I could be mad she didn't come say hi and then as soon as she comes my mood will light up

5. I overthink so much, I don't want to be a guy she ends up avoiding, but I also don't want to be slow and lose her to somebody else, if I haven't already.

What do I do? Why are my feelings so strong? It's been like this for the past few years with all of the girls I've liked",1,1764039801.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

He hasn’t gone outside in ten years but now is desperate to and yells at the front door constantly. We took him to the vet and he got on blood pressure meds that he has been on for several days now. But they haven’t helped his distress. He constantly paces even if he’s just walking back and forth on a coffee table. He is obsessively following my mom and freaks out if he can’t see her. Last night was a turning point though. My mom had been complaining about him waking her up at 3am the past couple of weeks. The vet said the blood pressure meds should help by now with his sleep. I stayed up until 3 with him trying to calm and comfort him. When I fell asleep at 3:15 he seemed okay. But he woke my mom up at 4 and me up at 5 and at 6 the house was awake. So he had someone with him literally all night. So he wasn’t alone the lights were on and he had food and water and a litter box. Now we are concerned that his quality of life isn’t as high as we thought it was. We called our vet and she said we might need to start thinking about if it’s the end or not.

Thoughtfully curated fruit platters (some fruit is left whole, some is cut in half. It’s so whimsical!), yummy pancakes and waffles fresh from the freezer, drizzled honey in **iced** coffee (WHY) and store-bought quiche that’s been sitting in the oven for an undetermined period of time (Meghan, for the love of god, you’re _not_ Ina, so please stop trying).

Kaiser, who once ridiculed Pippa Middleton for the same dumb obvious entertaining advice Meghan is now peddling, LOVED Meghan’s “nice little video”:
> Give it two days and they’ll call this Frozen Pancake-gate!! Everything Meghan does or says is so scandalous to them. The Frozen Pancakes That Brought A Nation To Its Knees! Meanwhile, Meghan spoke to People Magazine exclusively last week to offer some holiday entertaining tips. **I learned that Harry’s favorite part of Thanksgiving is the gravy!**

Last sentence bolded by me because it’s hilarious and somewhat sad she’s so excited to learn that…Harry likes gravy.

Speaking of pancakes, frozen or not, even Kaiser wasn’t that keen on them as a breakfast item back in 2018 when she was writing about Pippa:
> As for what Pippa says about breakfasts… I know I should be outraged that she’s dissing the more American-style breakfast, but here are a few things: most Americans aren’t really sitting down to eat pancakes, bacon and syrup every day anyway. That’s a special-occasion breakfast for most people. Secondly, I can’t eat that kind of stuff early in the morning either. I’m like Pippa – all I want is some yogurt and a piece of fruit, like a banana, and I’m good. **Thinking about scarfing down pancakes and bacon early in the morning leaves me cold.**

Anyway, Kaiser’s post on Meghan’s hostessing tips hasn’t gotten much traction (and the royalty tea sub where a lot of the CB commenters have migrated, hasn’t even posted about it yet) because what can they really say? We love a queen who tries to sell us overprice crepe mix but then recommends eating frozen pancakes!

Me, M20 currently at 2nd year college in an engneering course and my now ex, F19 in a HM course has been together for around 2 years. We've started dating a few months before graduation in senior high school, and we're classmates for 2 years there. I can say we were on good terms for a year, we were going on dates almost every week, and I even introduced her to my family. Her family is struggling financially since she has 4 other siblings and only their father is the one providing for them. So those dates every week, it was all on me. Mind you, we're both students and luckily I have the money to spend since I have a scholarship grand that gives me PHP8,000 per month. I was fine with spending some since I really did love her. However, she never once introduced me to her family. We've talked about that matter several times, but she insisted that her house was pretty bad and she'll get embarassed if I ever visit them. I got pretty upset since it's not fair on my part and she already knows that I won't leave her with that shallow of a reason. But we got over it and we continued this routine of dates every week or every other week just so we can be together. All of our dates, in those 2 years, have been on my tab. I never once complained, since I know that when we'd graduate and have our own jobs, she can be the one to spend on us. Buuuut, in the summer of our first year college, a friend of mine recommended a summer job in a coffee shop near us, since it was more suited for her with her course and all, I said that they should take her instead. And so she got hired and we were very happy. To help her, I always drive her to work with my motor. Even if it's 5am in the morning, I'll always get up and take her there. I even bring her food whenever I don't have anything to do. Her work continued even when it was the start of school. And I continued helping her even if my schedule is way beyond hers, like she has to get to her school at 8am and me in like 10am, I'll get up early to drive her and then go to my own school. I endured all of that, since I really really do love her. But for 2 years of those sacrifices, efforts, and gifts I gave her, I never once received one back. I never received a gift on my birthday from her, I never once got treated to a date even if she has the money, dang she never even invited me to a date, it was always me. It's like I was trying to make something work and she's just going with it without putting in effort. But I was dumb, I just accepted all of it without any second thoughts because I truly believe that it's all an investment, and she's worth those invesments. I even gave her a phone since she got a crappy one.

But then just recently, when I asked her ""can't wait na ikaw naman bumawi"" (can't wait for you to get back)(like efforts and such) after I drove her to her school, she just said ""anong bawi? Next life nalang bumawi"" (what do you mean get back? In the next life). 

That broke the shit out of me. I just now realized how dumb I am to force things to someone like that. I broke up with her, and now I just need the phone I gave her back since I can't stand the thought that she'll have somebody else to chat and be lovey with, with my OWN phone.

This might be just a one sided story since it's all on my perspective, but man I think I did the right thing. I am so dumb, I feel like I wasted 2 years of my life for nothing. If I give a rough estimation, I think I spent like 80k on her😭",1,1764039468.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

For some context, she's been absent for a majority of the year due to medical reasons and has only been able to join us for two classes, including the one where she asked me to be her project partner. So I've only ever interacted with her once or twice before that.

During our previous interactions, I realised she was really... Talkative, but it was always really self-centered. (Always bringing the discussion back to herself, not letting someone finish a story before starting her own, etc) She seems really nice but something about her doesn't match with me, which is alright, we can't be friends with everyone.

Today, we went into town to buy some material for said project and I quickly realised I found her annoying and pushy.

She seems to have a lot of troubles with certain boundaries. For example, I told her I had multiple tattoos and instead of asking 'can I see them?' she told me 'well, you need to show me the one on your shoulder and pictures of the two others'. I don't mind showing my tattoos, far from it, but there was something that irked me in the way she said it.

Same thing when I told her I would be going to get coffee with a crush, she told me 'you'll have to tell me how it went, send me a message with an emoji describing how it's going.' again, I wouldn't mind telling her how it went, but, again, the way she phrased it made it sound almost like an order.

What disturbs me the most is that we've only known each other for two classes and we haven't hung out together outside of that at all. And I feel like she's not asking me but ordering me to tell her these things, almost as if she was entitled to them.

After we bought what we needed, I walked back with her to her doctor's office for her appointment, because it wasn't a big detour and she asked me to. She asked me at least twice if I could stay with her and I told her that I couldn't every time. And right before she left for her appointment, she told me 'I like you, I like your sense of humour, I'm going to be hanging around you a lot more.' and the only thought that crossed my mind was 'oh, please no.' 

Would I be the asshole if I told her after our project that I don't want to be friends with her?
(And before you ask, I was too stunned by the way she asked about my tattoo and crush to have been able to tell her she was crossing a boundary, but I plan on telling her the next time we see each other)",2,1764039317.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,1,1.0,False

1p61aog,https://i.redd.it/yd00fm4dib3g1.jpeg,From Idea to Live App in Minutes: Building a PPT generate AI  with Gemini 3.0,"
After trying Gemini 3.0, I’m convinced it’s the fastest path from idea to production. Inside AI Studio, I can assemble an app in about five minutes—prompt, wire the tools, preview, and then deploy straight to Google Cloud. Auth, APIs, logging, and a clean UI come out of the box, so I spend my time on product, not plumbing.

My latest project is DocuDeck AI, a tiny tool with big leverage. Upload a PDF or Word document and Gemini 3.0 analyzes the content, extracts key points, and generates a professional PowerPoint deck in seconds. The interface is intentionally minimal: drag-and-drop upload, clear progress, smart headings, and balanced color themes—all auto‑tuned by the model.

What this enables

Instant iteration: ship a working MVP over a coffee break.
Production confidence: seamless Google Cloud deployment and observability.
Better UX by default: polished UI components without heavy frontend work.

(Injury advice),"Bad Day: Showed up to work 30 minutes before shift and brewed a fresh pot of coffee for those on the last shift still getting up and those coming in. The typical flow is that members (including probies) usually relax for an hour to drink coffee before starting checks and chores. Long story short one of our veteran members didn’t take too kindly to me and gave me a pretty hard time about everything from my physical appearance to my laziness and lack of communication with a new crew (I disagree with all of these takes but that’s not the point). I ended up dumping my coffee early and doing most morning duties alone. Ultimately, the guy who didn’t take to kindly to me ended up working on my training for the day and decided to do some attack line and search training which he is known for pushing extremely hard on. I did my search just fine and got some good remarks from the members on shift but once I went to stretch some hose that’s where some things went wrong. 
 
We were simulating smoke conditions down a set of stairs I had only  been down a few times before.  I stretched a line, had them charge it, and made entry. I made it to the bottom of the stairs but couldn’t see anything so I stayed low and reached forward expecting a door but realized that I was only on a landing followed by 3-4 more stairs. I fell face first down the stairs and landed mostly on my outstretched right arm. I felt a little pain but didn’t think much of it. I recouped, grabbed my hose line and started moving through the props. As I was dragging the line I think the hose got kinked or something so I planted my right arm and pulled with my left. As I did I felt my right shoulder dislocate posteriorly and almost as a reflex I jerked backwards while still gripping the door frame resetting the shoulder. It hurt but since it wasn’t still dislocated I figured it was just a fluke and continued with my attack. I tried to stay tripod position and move the hose through the maze but I ended up having my right shoulder “slip” 2 more times before tapping out. It was extremely embarrassing to tap out on training in front of all those people but my shoulder started hurting pretty bad afterwards. 
 
Long story short I delayed reporting but ended up getting to a dr and am now off for a minimum of 4 weeks while I wait on more testing. The DR said that best case scenario because of it slipping multiple times is that I do some PT but deal with lifelong instability due to my labrum and rotator cuff. Worst case scenario is the testing reveals a tear and I am off for 6 mos-a year recovering. 

Backstory: I turn 30 next year after a late career change from corporate misery to a job that I genuinely love (EMS more than fire but love both). After speaking to the doc he said that no matter what I will probably deal with some form of instability for the rest of my life with a medium to high risk injuring it again. Unfortunately, there are no public EMS only agencies in my area and I am now at a loss for where to go from here. I am sure I can recover enough to stay in the fire service on paper but I NEVER want to be the guy who is a liability on the fire ground and I’m nervous to even go back to training like that for fear of injuring it again. I do have a bachelors degree in a low demand IT field with no desire to go back to corporate life and I would love to stay here in the fire service but I’m already on the older side of transition and am worried about lasting a whole career over here.

Mid-70s, walks with a slight limp, always fixes things himself, and says hello in this calm, steady voice. I figured he was just retired and enjoying peace.

Last month the elevator got stuck between floors, and he happened to be inside with me. While we were waiting for maintenance, he pulled out this little metal toolkit and started calmly checking the emergency panels like he’d done it a hundred times before. I asked jokingly, “What, you used to be some kind of engineer?”

He looked up and said, “Not quite. I used to fly into places where the engineers couldn’t go.”

Turns out he was a **disaster-rescue helicopter pilot** for an international humanitarian team back in the 80s and 90s. He flew into earthquake zones, typhoon-hit villages, collapsed mining sites basically the places everyone else was trying to escape from. He showed me photos later: entire mountainsides wiped out, rooftops barely peeking over flood water, and him landing a chopper on what looked like a patch of gravel barely big enough for a bicycle.

Every Saturday morning now, I go upstairs with two cups of coffee, and he gives me these “flight lessons” in his living room. No actual controls, obviously just old manuals, hand-drawn diagrams, radio call examples, how to read wind, how to steady your breathing when you’re hovering above chaos.

The man can still describe microbursts and tail rotor failures like he experienced them yesterday. And when he talks about the people he pulled out of disaster zones, his whole face changes like he’s right back there.

It’s honestly wild that for years I thought he was just the guy who watered his plants on the balcony… and now he’s teaching me how to “fly” from a recliner chair.

It's made me the happiest I've ever been but also the loneliest. I've picked up more hours at both of my two jobs to make more money; I figured if I'm not doing anything I might as well make some extra cash. I've always been surrounded by girls and was everyone's GBF in high school, I've had no issue with making girlfriends my whole life but can never seem to make any other gay friends.... I do have anxiety, but I don't think I've ever let that get in the way of my friendships and connections. 

I'm extremely grateful my family is very supportive of me and my sister is also a lesbian. Sometimes I will hang out with her and her gf/ her other friends and I truly value my time with them and always look forward to it. I almost envy my sisters ability to make friends and social connections so easily. I really don't know why it's such a struggle for me. 

  
I did high school out in Western MA and although there was a very limited queer community (besides Northampton), I met all of my gay friends there. Once I moved about an hour and a half away and started weeding the real friends out of the filler friends my circle became VERY small and I have no one near me. I've used this alone time (my Sundays off) to discover who I am and what I enjoy doing, like trying new coffee shops, going to the gym, cooking and eating healthy, reading, learn Japanese, watch anime, and play video games.

I do try to put myself out there and even went on vacation to Florida alone and stopped in a gay bar in ST. Petersburg to try and make friends..... I stayed for 45 minutes and didn't talk to anyone. I don't understand why it's such a struggle to make other platonic gay friends. I understand that I'm more than likely the problem, but I don't know what to do in order to fix this. When I've tried to have platonic gay friends in the past, I usually get ditched once they have a BF.

I glance at the tombstone one more time before I head back to the Pack-house, feeling sad as I always do after visiting my Mother's grave.

My Mom isn't buried there, but Dad placed the tombstone to give us both a place to go to. No one seems to know where her grave is, as she died miles away from here. Mom and Dad had been running from her parents, who didn’t agree with her accepting her fated Mate.

Dad barely escaped with me, and when we came to this Pack, I was only a year old. Dad took the position of Assassin, as it was his birthright.

We were happy until I turned fourteen, and he was told I had to move into the Pack-house, waiting to be chosen by unmated males. Every female over fourteen in this Pack had to follow this rule. If my Father had known, he would have never joined this Pack—he would’ve kept running with me.

In the almost three years since I had to move into the Pack-house, I have been working in the kitchen, something I will keep doing after my Mate selects me.

""Umayza, I need you to—"" Luna's voice trails off as she frantically searches the kitchen, not realizing I'm standing right behind her. I step forward and clear my throat.

Startled, she spins around. ""Where did you come from?""

""I've been at my station since my shift started, Luna,"" I reply, noticing she brought another young female to replace me in the kitchen.

This is the day I've been dreading for the past three years—the day I get fitted for the outfit I'll wear in six months, a day I fear even more. Nearly every female in our Pack dreads that day, except maybe the High-ranking ones.

Like me, every girl in the Pack gets fitted for an outfit when she turns seventeen, then has six months to learn a dance to perform in front of all the unmated males. On that night, any male can inform the Alpha if he wants you as his Mate.

High-ranking females perform for a much smaller audience, since there are fewer unmated High-ranking males left. In my case, I should be performing for the Highest ranks as well, but for some reason, our Alpha decided I'd have a better chance if I perform for the general unmated males instead.

Most of them are fine, but there are a few I wouldn't describe as okay—and with me, most females feel that way. I have tried to get out of this performance, but our Alpha wouldn't hear of it, and Dad pleading with him didn’t work either.

Dad doesn't like the way this Pack chooses their Mates, and Dad doesn't participate in the process. He told me that he is working on a plan to get out of here. He doesn't want me to have to go through this process, and according to Dad, it is even illegal.

Until Dad can find a way out of this, I will play along with their charade, and as an Assassin's Daughter, I have mastered looking innocent to perfection—not that I am innocent at all. I have seen enough since I was moved into the Pack-house, and if I ever get the chance, I will take the Alpha and this Pack down.

Our Luna is waiting for me to step into the room where this whole ordeal will start, and I look around at all the fabric and drawings in the room. One outfit is more revealing than the other, and I want to run as our Luna holds the drawing of my outfit in front of me.

""They designed this especially for you, Umayza. It will be in scarlet red, made from lace and silk,"" Luna explains as I take a closer look. It looks more like a nightgown, and I don't think it is suited for a girl my age.

That evening, I finally see Dad for the first time in three days, and I tell him I had my measurements taken for my outfit. ""It is knee-length with a flaring silk skirt and a lace top. The V-neck is almost down to my waist, and there are triangles of fabric behind the lace where my breasts will be. Two little buttons will fasten the lace on my back, and other than that, it is a bare back.""

Dad looks disgusted as I describe the dress to him.

He tells me he has a few more things to take care of before we can leave this Pack, but he will make sure it happens in the next few weeks. I tell him he has at least six months until we have to leave.

Weeks pass as I continue working in the kitchen, fitting my so-called dress, and rehearsing the dance.

Today, I have a sinking feeling that something bad is about to happen.

We have to eat in the dining room with the unmated males, and we always have to sit in the same seat. The only thing that changes is the males we sit between during a day.

As I place bowls of fruit on the tables, I realize my fears were right: I'm seated next to the cruelest male in the Pack.

Every female avoids him due to the rumors about his previous two Mates. It's said that he kept them locked up in his cottage, isolated them from their friends and the rest of the Pack.

Rumors also say that he is abusive, both physically and mentally, and that either he killed them or they took their own lives—stories vary with every person who tells them.

I've noticed him glancing at me from time to time, and today I have to sit right next to him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I hope he'll ignore me like most males do, but I'm afraid I won't be that lucky this time.

Our Alpha instructs us to take our seats, and I reluctantly sit down. As unmated males sit beside me, I keep my eyes on my plate. When the signal is given to start eating, I notice my nightmare placing a bowl of fruit in front of me. I quietly thank him as I take the bowl from his hands.

Neither male speaks to me during breakfast, and I feel relieved when I return to the kitchen. I spend my break in my room, reviewing everything Dad and I discussed over the past two weeks, before heading back to work.

Lunch is similar to breakfast, and as I make my way to the ballroom, I hear our Luna is already present. Over the years, I've learned to distinguish her laughter, and this one signals trouble for whoever is involved.

I stop beside the door, which they left ajar, unsure if they expect me yet, as I usually arrive ten minutes later.

""Does Umayza suspect this is a setup?"" one of the other females asks, and I want to scream, No.

""Of course not. She's as gullible as her Father was when he arrived here. They have no idea he requested the Alpha to put her in the other group, and he'll make sure she never finds out. He'll have his fun with her, but I hope she'll last longer than the others did.

His first Mate disappeared within a year, and his second Mate within two years. But you know, I don't care—he only picks females not born in this Pack,"" Luna responds. I quickly walk away until I am out of hearing range.

My heart races with a surge of dread and revulsion. To feign ignorance, I put on a light expression and start humming as I walk towards the ballroom again.

""Hello, Luna,"" I greet as I walk into the ballroom, only to stop dead in my tracks when I see my so-called dress ready.

""Umayza, today you will rehearse in your outfit,"" Luna says, holding the dress out to me. There's something in her eyes that tells me she's up to something.

Chapter 2 Conviction

Umayza

""Luna, I think there's been a mistake with my measurements. This is way too short,"" I protest after I change into my outfit.

The dress, now altered, barely covers my body. I can't help but worry that a simple turn will expose my panties to everyone.

""No, it's perfect for you,"" Luna says with a cold smile. ""I want to make sure that you find a Mate, and I don't want any of our High-ranking members to pick you. When someone requested you be placed in this group, I convinced my Mate it was for the best. I never wanted your Father or you to join our Pack.""

She states this, and I see there are at least five Warriors present—something that is normally not allowed during rehearsal.

I stare at our Luna as she starts laughing, and I finally realize she actually hates me, for whatever reason that might be.

Without thinking further, I lunge at her, my fist connecting with her nose in a sharp, resounding crack.

Two Warriors immediately seize me, pulling me away before I can do any more harm. One of the High-ranking females steps forward, her gaze icy. ""You've assaulted your Luna, and for that, you will be convicted."" She looks at everyone in the room, and they all agree with her.

The Luna has a smirk on her face as the Warriors drag me down to the dungeons.

An hour later, my Father arrives at the dungeon. There is no worry in his eyes as he says, ""Be patient. Everything will be alright.""

Whenever Dad says that, I know something unexpected is about to happen. It's something his Father taught him, and so far, it always turns out well.

I nod my head as I see my nightmare coming down the stairs.

His eyes move up and down my body, and the look he gives me sends shivers down my spine.

When Dad notices my discomfort, he turns around. ""Stay away from her,"" he growls at the man.

Dad pulls a chair in front of my cell and keeps his eyes on my nightmare. One of the Warriors standing guard grabs a sheet from a shelf and hands it to me through the bars.

I thank him as I wrap the sheet around myself.

We talk about everything that won’t give away that something is going to happen—the latest book I read, the show he watched on TV the other night. We talk about Mom and how much I resemble her. I have her light brown hair and chocolate brown eyes.

About an hour after dinner, our Alpha walks in with two huge males behind him, and I can tell they are Lycans.

Dad gives me a reassuring smile as I look at him. Apparently, this is my ticket out of here, and for some reason, our Alpha is not pleased.

Both males are about 6'3"" with blond hair and blue eyes. Anyone can see that they are twins, and if I had to bet on it, I would say they are High-ranking Lycans.

""Open her cell,"" one of the males says to a Warrior, and our Alpha just nods, though he looks like he wants to object.

""You are charged with assaulting your Luna. The Council has ordered us to bring you to the Academy,"" the same male tells me.

""You can leave the sheet in your cell,"" the other male says, and with some fright in my eyes, I look at Dad.

""Gentlemen, my Daughter was in a fitting session at the time of the attack. I brought her a change of clothes, as I know she won't be comfortable in what she's wearing under that sheet,"" Dad says.

I see both males looking from me to Dad, so I decide to show them what I am wearing.

I turn in such a way that only they can see what is underneath the sheet, and I see anger flashing through their eyes.

They order everyone out and tell Dad to hand me the bag with clothes he brought for me. Then, they all walk out of the dungeons.

Ten minutes later, one of the Lycans walks back in and tells me to follow him.

Dad is waiting outside with the other Lycan. He hugs me as he whispers in my ear that we will meet soon. I kiss him on his cheek before I follow one of the Lycans to a black SUV.

The young female who has been covering my station these past few weeks smiles at me, and I get a feeling that she called in my conviction to the Council. Within seconds, the other Lycan gets behind the wheel.

Just as he turns the ignition on, my nightmare jumps in front of the SUV.

Our Alpha quickly pulls him away, and they start arguing as the SUV passes them. I sigh in relief. I know both males heard it, but they don't say a word as we leave the Pack grounds behind us.

I close my eyes and lean back into the car seat, letting the events of the past day run through my mind.

I have a sinking feeling my nightmare won't give up easily, and I wonder if I should tell the men in the front seats about him.

As my thoughts race, sleep takes over.

Shouting startles me awake. I am very disoriented as I try to figure out what is going on.

""Damn it, Evander! Keep your eyes on the road. I'll see where they're coming from!"" the passenger yells. I glance to my left as I see him looking to the right.

""Left,"" I say, spotting a wolf emerging from the tree line. Evander swerves, barely avoiding the charging wolf.

I recognize the wolf instantly, and a cold certainty settles over me—this won't end until he's dead.

""I know this isn't the time to tell you my life story, but that wolf won't stop until he has me or he's dead,"" I say, my voice tight.

For a moment, the wolf seems to vanish, leaving a strange knot in my stomach. I scan the area, turning my head left and right, trying to spot him again. Up front, the men debate whether to take a detour to shake him off.

""Conri, call Council-member Boaz and ask what we should do about this wolf. Also, tell him he's after the convict we have in the SUV,"" Evander says, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. I keep scanning the surroundings, hoping the wolf doesn't show up again.

""Boaz wants us to head to one of the safe-houses. They'll hold a conference call to hear her story,"" Conri says after ending the call. ""They don't want to wait until she reaches the Academy. After that, they'll decide what to do about the wolf.""

Conri explains that the Council has safe-houses all over the country within the grounds of allied Packs. They plan to take me to the nearest one, where I'll get a chance to tell the Council what happened.

I continue scanning the area, but so far, my nightmare hasn't reappeared. I start to relax a little, though my Father's lessons keep me alert, even after we arrive at the Pack where we'll be staying for a few hours.

Evander drives past the Pack-house, quickly leaving the Pack village behind. He stops in front of a small cottage hidden among tall trees. I realize I would never have found this place on my own if Evander didn't know where to go.

Conri opens the door and extends a hand to help me out. At 5'7"", I feel pretty small standing next to him, and when Evander joins us, I get an irrational urge to run. But without my wolf, I know I wouldn't stand a chance.

It'll take another year before I get my wolf and can shift—maybe then I'll be able to outrun them.

I glance up at both of them and suddenly burst into laughter, realizing I'd never outrun them, even with my wolf.

They both look at me, confused.

""Sorry,"" I chuckle. ""I just realized that even with my wolf, there's no way I'd outrun the two of you.""

Thankfully, they have a sense of humor and laugh along with me.

Chapter 3 Evander

Evander

""Gentlemen, we just received a call from Bright Moon Pack. One of their members was accused and convicted of assaulting their Luna, and we need you to go pick her up. We weren't given many details, but the caller did mention that we needed to act quickly. She sounded pretty fearful, and she told us not to trust the Alpha and Luna about what happened—that we needed to hear her story as well,"" Council-member Boaz says.

Conri and I nod our heads as we get up from our seats, and we waste no time getting to our SUV.

""Evander, any thoughts as to why this person was asking the Council to react fast?"" Conri asks me, and I let the little information we have pass through my mind. It is not much, and I understand why Conri is asking me this question, considering the past.

My mind travels back to another assignment we did for the Council—a young woman had been accused and convicted by the Pack, and a Warrior had called the Council to inform them. When we arrived at the Pack, the Alpha had sworn up and down it had been a misunderstanding, and we contacted the Council on how to proceed.

We were told to head back to the Academy and leave the punishment up to the Alpha, as it had been a minor incident according to him. A month later, a neighboring Pack had contacted the Council that a female had asked for asylum—she was more dead than alive at that time.

When the Council was informed of the circumstances, they had realized it was the female we had been sent for, and Conri and I had been sent back to talk to her. During our conversation, we found out that if we had talked to her that day, we would have taken her with us.

To this day, we regret not talking to her, not saving her, and she made us promise with her dying breath that we would never walk away until we had heard both sides of the story. The Council allowed our Squad Captain Armand and the rest of our team to join us, and we were joined by Investigator Harlyn.

Together, we had managed to find the evidence against the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Turns out that the female had been the Alpha's Daughter, but he had never treated her as such, and his Beta and Gamma had taken liberties with her for years.

The Warrior who had called the Council had accused her on purpose—he had hoped to get her out of the situation she was in before it would end her life, and if we hadn't listened to the Alpha, he would have succeeded in rescuing her.

Conri pulls me from my thoughts as he asks again if I have any idea why the Council was asked to act quickly. ""We know it involves a female, and there are a number of reasons why a female would attack a Luna. Most of those reasons are enough to get convicted by the Council as well, so we can assume that it is not a standard reason,"" I say.

I let him think on my words as we drive towards Bright Moon Pack.

By the time we get there, we still haven't narrowed down the answer, and I am afraid we may never find out, as we will not be there when she has to face the Council. Maybe we will get the chance to ask her on the way back.

The Alpha is not too pleased with our presence—he actually looks really uncomfortable—and as we follow him to the dungeons, I hear Conri through our mind-link: ""I think the caller was right; it is a good thing we came this soon."" I believe he is correct in his assumption.

The girl in the cell is gorgeous, and I can see that the male with her is related to her. I see an uncomfortable look on her face after I tell her to leave the sheet behind. Once she realizes we don't understand her concerns, she turns her back on the others and reveals what she is wearing. I quickly understand her discomfort, and I order everyone out as I tell her to get changed.

The girl is wearing a dress that barely covers her, and the top is mostly see-through. I groan inwardly as I take in how she looks. ""Fuck, Evander. What the hell is she wearing? There is no way I will let her walk out of here dressed like that,"" Conri says.

As we are waiting outside, the Alpha orders the Warriors to follow him to the Pack-house. Her Father looks around before he turns to us and hands me a piece of paper. ""Give this to my Daughter once she is safe and the Council gives you permission,"" he says. I peek inside to see a number written down.

I nod my head before I push it into my pocket. Conri walks back into the dungeons after ten minutes to take the girl to our SUV, and I see Pack-members gathering as Conri guides her over to the SUV.

One member looks murderous, while another has a small smile on her face, and I think I just found out who the girl's guardian angel is. But I don't understand why the male looks as if we took his Mate away from him. Unless, of course, she is his underaged Mate—that would explain his expression.

But if she is his Mate, then why didn't he say anything? Or why was he not with her in the dungeon? I only have more questions than answers, and I need to talk to Conri about this. I also need to inform the Council about my thoughts, and I hope they will be able to help her.

The Alpha pulls the idiot out of the way so I can drive off with the girl in the backseat, and as I look in the rearview mirror, she closes her eyes. Within minutes, she is fast asleep. It gives me the chance to tell Conri my thoughts, and he quickly relays everything to the Council through an email.

""What do you think that piece of fabric was about?"" Conri asks me, and I think back on the minuscule, red dress she had been wearing, cursing at Conri for putting that picture back in my head. I thought she had been gorgeous with that sheet wrapped around her, but seeing her in that dress...

I shake my head as if I can get rid of the image that way, and from the corner of my eye, I see that Conri isn't doing much better. The sight of her in that dress affects both of us. We both softly chuckle as we adjust ourselves, and I keep an eye on our passenger.

A movement on the right side of the SUV pulls my attention away from her, and Conri is on high alert as he looks out the window, but there is nothing to see out there. I curse as something flies over the hood of the SUV, and Conri follows whatever it was into the forest.

A moment later, I curse loudly as I pull the steering wheel hard to the left—a wolf jumps out of the way in the nick of time, and a moment later, the wolf is back again. ""A rogue on a suicide mission,"" Conri mumbles as we swerve across the road, trying to avoid the wolf.

Conri is shouting at me to keep my eyes on the road, but he can't watch both sides of the SUV at the same time, and I don't want to ram this SUV into a wolf. ""Left,"" I hear from the backseat, and I manage to avoid him once again, but her next words freeze the blood in my veins.

""He won't give up until he has me or until he is dead."" 

Chapter 4 Conri

Evander

It is a whisper, but it is a very clear whisper, and Conri calls Council-member Boaz at my request. We need to know what we can and can't do when it comes to this idiotic wolf, and we need to keep this girl safe at all costs.

Council-member Boaz orders us to go to the nearest safe-house, and I sigh in relief the moment I start to recognize my surroundings. It won't be long before we are at the cottage. I am glad we have been here before, because now no one knows who we brought with us.

It is a one-story cottage surrounded by tall trees and a whole variety of wildflowers. There are two bedrooms at the back, and that is more than enough to accommodate us tonight. As Conri stands next to her, I realize that she isn't tall, and we both tower over her.

She hasn't lost her sense of humor as she tells us what ran through her mind, and I chuckle as I try to imagine her running away from us. My Lycan starts to chuckle at that image. Conri guides her into the cottage as I grab the bag from the SUV—her Father gave it to me after Conri left us to get her from the dungeon.

My Lycan has been acting strange for the past two days, and he is starting to annoy the hell out of me. Conri told me that his Lycan was no better. Neither of our Lycans are able to tell us why they act the way they do, nor can they explain what it is they are feeling.

Tomorrow will be the first day of the Full Moon, and I have a suspicion our Lycans are hoping to find their Mate. We have been waiting long enough for her. We have been waiting for her for thirty years, and Conri and I are close to giving up hope.

With every year that passes, my Lycan starts to get more depressed, but every time I bring up taking a chosen Mate, he blows up in my face, and it takes days before he talks to me again. Conri's Lycan is the same when it comes to our fated Mate and a chosen Mate.

We sometimes talk about it and have a good laugh at their attitude towards a chosen Mate. Conri's Lycan refused to talk to him for a week when Conri once suggested to me that we each take our own chosen Mate—not that he was being serious.

Rummaging in the kitchen pulls me from my thoughts, and I see Conri in the doorway with his arms crossed in front of his chest.

Conri

After I ask my Brother why he thinks she got convicted, I know where his thoughts are going—the same place and time as mine—and I know why the Council chose us to go get this girl. Not that they don’t trust anyone else to do the job, but because of our past experiences.

The Alpha is waiting for us as we stop in front of the Pack-house, and I can tell by the look on his face he is not pleased to see us—not that Evander or I care about that at all. ""Alpha, we received a call that one of your Pack-members attacked your Luna. We are here to bring her in front of the Council,"" I say.

Before the Alpha gets a chance to say anything, his Luna steps forward. ""She hit me in the face and broke my nose,"" she growls angrily, and the Alpha has no choice but to show us where they are holding the girl. On our way to the dungeons, the Alpha tries to convince us that his Luna was overreacting to Umayza’s attack.

""Alpha, Umayza attacked your Luna and broke her nose. There were witnesses to it, and they convicted her of assault. We will take her to the Council for her sentencing,"" I say—not that the Council will sentence anyone without hearing the full story.

Over the years, I have seen males and females brought in front of the Council, and some of them were actually sentenced for their crimes. But most of them had been relocated or given the chance to get revenge for a wrongful conviction. Not that Packs were informed of what happened to the Pack-members we brought in front of the Council.

Squad-members who are sent to get a convicted member from a Pack usually don’t even find out what they were accused of or what their explanation for their crime was. Sometimes we get to hear the story as we bring them to a new Pack, or we escort them towards the Sanctuary.

We walk down the stairs into the dungeons, through a hallway leading us further into the dungeons, and the Alpha opens a door that leads into a small room with one cell. My eyes get drawn to the female inside the cell—her hair in a messy bun on top of her head, and her chocolate brown eyes don’t reveal anything.

My Lycan growls in my head as she shows us what she is wearing under that sheet. I link Evander to tell him I won’t allow her to walk out of there dressed like that. He orders everyone out of the dungeons to give her time to change into something more comfortable for her.

My mind is on Umayza, and I know her appearance affected Evander as much as it did me when I see him adjusting himself after I had asked what that piece of fabric was about. I had quickly shoved it into her bag when her back was turned to me—I wanted the Council to see what it was she had been wearing at the time.

My Lycan is convinced it has something to do with the attack, and I have to agree with him on that. It was a little too revealing for my taste. I think as long as she was standing still there wouldn’t be a problem, but if she moved, it would have revealed more than any male should be able to see.

From the corner of my eye, I see movement, and my yelling at Evander wakes Umayza up. Her eyes are on the left side of the road as I watch the right side of the road. Once I am certain the wolf is gone, I call Council-member Boaz with the information I have, and once he gives the okay, we head for the nearest safe-house.

Despite the situation, she hasn’t lost her sense of humor, and my Lycan shows me an image of us chasing after her. I guide her into the cottage and show her where her room is, but she is more interested in the kitchen. There are fresh fruits and vegetables in the fridge, and I can smell that the Alpha has recently been here.

Looks like the Council warned him we were on our way, and I am glad he put some provisions into the fridge and cupboards before we got here. Umayza seems at ease as she is putting everything she wants on the counter. I watch her as Evander walks into the cottage, and for a moment, he stops to look at what is going on in the kitchen.

He smiles as he walks towards the back of the house with her bag. ""You might want to get the dress out of there—I took it as evidence for the Council,"" I say through the mind-link, and he growls back at me. I chuckle at him, knowing exactly why he growled at me.

Chapter 5 Safe-house

Conri

I hear water running in the shower, and I wait for Evander to get back to the kitchen before I head for the shower myself. Once I am back, Evander asks her if she wants to eat first or if she wants to shower first. ""Food first,"" she says as she places three plates on the kitchen island and takes the seat across from me.

Evander sits down next to me, and we are enjoying the food she has prepared for us. She asks us if anyone knows that we are here, and Evander tells her that the Alpha does, but that he won’t be coming here, as that is the deal the Council made with him.

""None of the Packs come to the safe-house when it is occupied. The Council doesn’t want them to know who is here, and it is for their own protection. If your Alpha was to call here, no one will be able to tell him if you are here or not,"" I explain, and she tells me that that makes sense to her.

Evander and I tell her to take a shower while we clean up the kitchen. At first, she wants to object, but one look at us and she thanks us before she walks to the back of the house. It doesn’t take us long to clean everything up, and I start making coffee for Evander and myself.

I hear her sniffle the air as she walks towards us, and I ask her if she would like some coffee as well. ""Yeah, might keep me awake long enough to answer the questions from the Council,"" she says, and Evander and I chuckle as we know a meeting can be boring at times.

Evander tells her that normally we don’t hear about the charges or why someone committed the alleged crimes—that we hardly ever hear about what triggered them to do what they did—and that in some cases, we are more than curious to find out.

""Well, looks like today is your lucky day, as you will be here when I have to talk to the Council,"" she says, but she doesn’t sound as if it bothers her that we will be hearing everything as well.

Umayza

It is nine in the evening when Evander sets up a laptop for the conference call with the Council. Unlike I had expected, I feel comfortable with the two males next to me, and I know that they will keep me safe while I am with them. Instead of multiple screens popping up for the conference call, there is only one, and I can see the seven Council-members.

Conri introduces the Council-members to me, and Council-member Dayanah tells me that she will be leading the questioning for this investigation. She asks if I want Conri and Evander to leave the cottage. ""That won’t be necessary—they have seen a part of what I need to tell the Council,"" I answer.

Conri sits down to my left as Evander sits down to my right, and for some reason, I feel completely at ease. I don’t feel the anxiety I would feel as I had during one of the meals back in my Pack. I take a deep breath to calm my nerves, and I decide to start my story with how we came to live in Bright Moon Pack.

""My parents were fated Mates, but my maternal Grandparents didn’t approve of my Father, and my parents left Mom’s Pack to be together. However, they were hunted down by my Grandparents, and by the time they finally caught up with my parents, I had already been born. Not that it stopped them from hunting us down—they didn’t even stop after Mom died while protecting me.

Dad kept running until we reached Bright Moon Pack, and Dad was offered the position of Assassin, as that is his rank. Dad was able to build a normal life for us there. It wasn’t until I turned fourteen that we found out this Pack has a rather strange look on Mates—our Alpha doesn’t allow anyone to accept their fated Mate, and anyone that finds their fated Mate is ordered to reject them.

Every female starts living in the Pack-house at the age of fourteen—no exceptions. The unmated females have to stay inside the Pack-house. We were not allowed to go to our family’s homes, and they were allowed a minimum of contact with us at the Pack-house.""

I feel the males next to me get angrier the more I say, and even the Council-members look angry.

""We have to do all the chores in the Pack-house. We prepare the meals for everyone, and when we have our meals, our stations get covered by mated females. During the meals, we sit in assigned seats, and each day, different unmated males sit on either side of us.

When a female turns seventeen, our Luna takes her to a part of the Pack-house we call the fitting room. Your measurements get taken while our Luna picks out a drawing of your outfit, and from that day on, the female has to attend dance classes.

They teach the female a very sensual dance, which you have to perform in front of all the unmated males six months before you turn eighteen. If a male wants to have you as his chosen Mate, he informs our Alpha. There is a ceremony for the High-ranking males and one for the Warriors.

With my Father being our Pack’s Assassin, I normally would have to perform in front of the High-ranking males. But the Wolf that attacked us asked our Alpha to put me in front of the Warriors, as he has an interest in me. I am not sure if our Alpha wanted to grant his request, but on the day I attacked our Luna, she told me she had convinced her Mate to allow it.

She told me she never wanted my Father or me to join the Pack, and this was her way of getting revenge. They also altered my dress to be a lot shorter than it initially was, and when I asked her about it, she told me how she had helped my nightmare to get me in front of him.""

I didn’t look at anyone as I spoke, and my eyes are still on the floor once I am finished.

""Umayza, you had every right to attack her, and we won’t sentence you for this crime. I will send a team to investigate this Pack, because I want to know why the Luna didn’t want you and your Father in her Pack, and we will put a stop to their way of running their Pack.

Is there any way you can contact your Father?"" Council-member Dayanah asks, and I shake my head as I didn’t have my phone with me.

""Council-member Dayanah, her Father handed me a piece of paper with a phone number on it before we left. He asked me to give it to her once she was safe, and if you would allow me to give it to her,"" Evander says.

Council-member Dayanah tells him to give it to me. I smile as I open the piece of paper and recognize my Father’s handwriting.

Chapter 6 Mate

Evander

That my Lycan and I were fuming was putting it mildly, and I could feel through our bond that my Brother wasn’t doing any better. The Council is quick in telling Umayza she will not be sentenced for attacking her Luna, and she releases a sigh of relief.

I don’t understand why some Lycans or Werewolves can be this depraved. The leaders of Bright Moon Pack are really a fry short of a happy meal, and I want to knock some sense into them. Knowing there will be an investigation makes me feel a little better, but not by much.

Council-member Dayanah asks Umayza what she wants to do, and Umayza tells the Council she wants to train to be an Assassin just like her Father—to help the Council get justice for those who can’t get it themselves.

""Umayza, the Council grants you your request. Please call your Father and ask him to report to the Academy as soon as he can. We can use someone with his experience here,"" Council-member Dayanah says. Soon after that, we say our goodbyes to the Council-members.

Umayza looks exhausted, and Conri asks her if she wants to call her Father tonight or tomorrow when we are on our way to the Academy. She opts for the next day as she is struggling to keep her eyes open. Conri guides her to her bedroom as I get some sodas for Conri and myself.

I am proud of Umayza for telling her story to the Council. I can only imagine what it was like growing up in a Pack like that, and I am glad Conri and I grew up in a Pack that values its members. Before I can let my mind wander to White Crescent Pack, Conri walks back into the room.

""She was asleep before she hit the pillow,"" he says with a smile on his face. ""I am glad we grew up in White Crescent Pack. Alpha Atlas was a good and fair Alpha, and Luna Anthea was so sweet. I know Amarah has some big shoes to fill, but I know she will be an excellent Alpha.""

Before I can reply, Conri’s phone starts ringing. When he sees the caller-ID, he puts it on speaker. ""Captain, to what do we owe this pleasure?"" Conri asks, and Captain Armand tells us he and the rest of our Squad will meet us outside the Pack’s territory.

""Knowing a male is after Umayza made Council-member Boaz contact me to come up with a plan to get her safely to the Academy, and Theron has come up with a solid plan. We need clothes that smell like her to put in our SUVs before we all drive away.

There is a fork in the road miles from the Pack that leads in four different directions, and that is where we will all split up to see if we can get rid of him. We will keep in touch by phone, and hopefully you guys can get Umayza to the Academy without further problems,"" Armand says.

Conri tells him he will take care of the clothes they will need. He walks out of the living room, and after I have agreed on our meeting time, I disconnect the call. I stand in front of the window, staring at nothing in particular as Conri walks back into the room. He tells me that he put her clothes under her sheets.

""I left a set on a chair in her room for her to wear tomorrow, and the rest will be divided over the other SUVs. I really hope this will work—I would hate for that idiot to get his hands on her,"" Conri says. As my Lycan roars in my head, his Lycan roars out loud.

""I am going to give Armand her little red dress,"" he says with a smirk on his face, and I groan as the image of Umayza in that outfit pops into my head. My Lycan has a smirk on his face as he says, ""Something to picture when you have to take care of yourself."" I groan again as I quickly block him.",1,1764038168.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

Hey I’m Denise! I’m a pretty easy going an extroverted gal. I struggle to sit still and have a lot of different interests.

I’ll describe my situation. Been in a relationship with a wonderful man for 2.5 years. First 1.5 years was amazing, he was the first to say he loved me and he really is an amazing person who wants to make everyone happy. 

He is plagued by worry, anxiety, and everything gets to him so even if I say something like he should have done the dishes, it would become a whole night of silence for saying something normally and not with any anger. I knew about all this from the start.

But he recognised it and always worked through it, had had a therapist, a spiritual coach, a life coach. I just became more careful about not saying too much as to me, these are smaller things. I can always do the dishes, he and I are good together. His mum loves me, his kids love me and he loves me. I love him. 

He was divorced before we met and money has always been a sort of thing for him - that he built his life by working hard and saving, his marriage of 14 years broke up as she asked for a divorce but they were not in love for a long time, and after that he gave up half his income/ earnings to her so he is left with a much smaller retirement pot - he wanted to retire early as he doesn’t care about money, just wants enough to live a decent life. Anyway so he is still working… always said his ex-wife randomly gave up her job one day, never went back to it or they could have built much more as a double income family. 

I come in when he is already divorced, he takes great care to introduce me to his kids slowly as he is a great dad and wants to make sure the kids can handle it (kids live 60% of time with mum and 40% with him - the ex wife and him are now on amicable terms, there’s no hostility). 

Him and me have an amazing relationship, I can’t believe how lovely he is and all round nice guy (I had enough jerks in the past). Our interests are quite different but I show up for all the stuff important in his life and for 2.5 years we are together atleast 5 days out of 7 and we travel a lot. My friends and family love him.

This year I felt a bit strange when we travelled for new year, I fell sick and while he was nice, it wasn’t really a loving or caring side that I saw, almost just normal but I would have cared more for a friend if I travelled and they were sick. Anyway, still a good holiday and we came back.

Second holiday a few months later (in between all was fine, according to me), he seemed checked out and in his own head, no physical contact, enjoying the holiday well enough but physically and emotionally I felt something was off. I thought he has some stresses as he often does. Tried to talk about it when we came back, he didn’t really give any answer, said you are right but nothing else.

Then changed to good again, we went to his home town, met his family, met lots of his very close friends and it was brilliant. We didn’t fight or have any less than happy day - I was surprised but joyful that maybe the previous few months were just him working through it. 

Came back, and then somehow there was no sex for maybe 8 weeks. I put it down to him having some minor health issues, not feeling great, being tired. For his daughter’s birthday, we celebrated it together with her friends and his ex-wife, all great. 

I had a big birthday and he helped me plan it, did a lot to surprise me, gave me so many gifts, balloons, a lovely dinner and then we had a party later with all of his friends and my friends. I was over the moon as he really went above and beyond in our private birthday celebration. The only hiccup being I found a drunk text in his phone to some woman I don’t know saying he missed her. I didn’t say anything then as I didn’t want to ruin things. Then this party was ten days ago, it was great, everyone loved it and had a good time.

Three days ago, I received some bad news that my company was transitioning my role out (corporate speak). That day, he was sick from something he ate the night before and wasn’t good so I didn’t tell him this news when I went home in the evening. The best day, we went to get some coffee and that’s when I told him. To be clear, he knows I live in my own place (we live separately but either he is at my place or I am at his), that I have savings, and I didn’t say anything alarmist; just that this happened. He then deflected the conversation to something that happened in his workplace etc. I was surprised at the lack of empathy, we continued some other conversation, then he gave me a hug in the elevator when we were returning but overall, all I wanted to hear was I am here for you. But he didn’t say it.

He had made plans to go out with his friends that day for quite sometime so as he was ironing his shirt; with this at the back of my head, plus the drunk text that I had not asked about… I said, are you happy with us- as in our relationship? And very casually while ironing his shirt; he said, you are more certain of it than I am. So I asked, what do you mean? He says he is not content, that he doesn’t know what he wants. I am gob smacked as I can’t understand how this happened. He says “I wanted us to have a good time, but I had my doubts, if what I am feeling is enough” 

I asked about the woman and he says she’s just a friend and helps him through stuff. I’ve met all his friends and he has never mentioned her. But he says there’s nothing there, that there is no other woman, he is just not happy. None of this was an angry conversation - I am quite calm and so was he. I left his house and next day he texted that he is thinking of me, is concerned and sorry that he didn’t make me happy - but I reply I am happy, it’s me who doesn’t make him happy. 

I look back at the first 1.5 years as amazing, this year maybe I saw some signs but he didn’t come outright and say anything when I asked, last couple of months, amazing. Now, it’s all gone.

Now I have no job and no relationship. I am lost. ",1,1764037981.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

I’ll start with this one from Ju Fufu’s trailer, pretty sure I can accurately guess what Yixuan is drinking here: a medium iced latte. Reasons being 1: the fact that the cup is transparent, hot coffee cups at shops use styrofoam due to it being a good insulator for hot drinks, whereas iced drinks use clear plastic. 2: cup size and shape, too big to be a small, but large iced coffee cups have a large bevel at the bottom (larger than the one here). 3: the layering, typically regular coffees get mixed when cream/milk is added, but lattes specifically don’t get mixed (though the drink will naturally mix when poured), you could argue the reason for the top of the drink being darker is due to shading, but it looks too dark for that, and there’s clearly the start of a gradient at the bottom.
I know all this seems dumb, but, having worked at a Dunkin, when I saw this shot my mind immediately started trying to figure out what Yixuan had ordered.

So, seriously, you all got any dumb little mostly useless pieces of information like this for any of the other trailers?",0,1764037877.0,ZZZ_Official,1,0.29,False
1p60t3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1p60t3o/is_my_sister_jealous_of_me/,Is my sister jealous of me?,"It's a bit long actually.
Well, it turns out that a year and 8 months ago I became a partner with my boyfriend, my sister went out with us, we took her for walks and things like that, just to make it clear I am younger than my sister by 8 years so at that time she was 26 and I was 18, at this moment I am 19 and she is 27, but without deviating from the topic everything was very good, until 3 months after I became a couple after my boyfriend, she started talking to a Guy, I didn't know who he was, the truth is I didn't know him, my sister is a single mother so wherever we went she went and my nephew went, that's how we were until my boyfriend and I made a date and we were going to the VIP cinema, well my sister didn't ask me or anything, but she simply decided that she would go with us and it was okay haha, but she wanted to go with us because she had invited that boy she met, she met him on Tiktok and he lives almost 50 km from where we live, but well it turns out that We thought that he would pick up my sister and we would each go in a car, but no, it turns out that he didn't have a car, being 35 years old, so we had to take my sister to the cinema, pay for the VIP tickets for the 4 of us and aha, well, since we paid for the seats we decided where to sit, which was at the top in one corner and they were at the bottom of our row in the other corner, when we left the movie they made a drama of us for having put them in that place, my boyfriend was not paid for the tickets or nothing, and it was okay?, then we separated and we were hanging around the square where the cinema was, and my boyfriend and I went to a place that is pure games, we got ready to play and they went to a Starbucks, at that moment my mother called me and asked me why my sister didn't answer her and I told her that I honestly didn't know where she was, since I didn't know if she would stay there to consume the coffee or go around exploring the entire square, the conversation ends there and when I get home and my mom asks me why my sister wasn't with us, and I tell her it was because she was with this boy and she tells me like she was with a boy? And I tell her yes, he is the one she always talks to in the afternoons, and well, it becomes a bigger problem because I didn't know that my sister had not told my mother that she was going to see this boy, and my sister and this boy start to say things to me because my mother scolded my sister, after that months passed, and every time I saw myself or invited my boyfriend to the house, my sister would wear clothes with low neckline, super small shorts and provocative clothes in front of my partner, which made me It made me uncomfortable, and then in September it was my sister's birthday and this boy gave her a few perfumes, well this happened one weekend, and during the week she hid several perfumes in my backpack from the University, and when her boyfriend arrived the next weekend he told her the lie that I had used those perfumes and had hidden them in my backpack, I must clarify that I am a little special with the aromas of perfumes so I didn't like the smells that those perfumes had the most At least, everyone in my house knew that I would never be able to grab my sister's perfume and that's why I have never been one to grab things that aren't mine without permission, but well that weekend my sister told her boyfriend that I had grabbed her perfume and that little boy told my mom to control me because how was it possible for me to grab things that aren't mine, what I didn't know was that even my sister-in-law had turned against me since my sister-in-law doesn't like me because put many limits on their attitude, I am their younger sister, my older brother is 30, my sister is 27 and I am 19, which is why my brother has always taken care of me since I was a baby and I get along very well with him, which is why my sister-in-law gets jealous of me and that is why she dislikes me, so my mother, seeing that they were attacking me, told them that in my life I would take those perfumes because they are not smells that I like, and there I stay, and now my sister searches through my things, my clothes, my backpack, things that could affect me, telling my mom, a few months ago I had an appointment with my Gynecologist for colic control issues and she gave me some birth control pills but I had talked to my mom about why I was taking them, my sister didn't know anything, the thing is that I take them out of my backpack and show them to my mom and dad, just to hurt me by thinking that I was taking them for birth control but no, no, My boyfriend and I have decided other things in terms of sexual relations, but I understand that anyone who sees that would think that it is due to birth control, but my annoyance was that I took them out of my backpack because I was rummaging through it just to make myself look bad in front of my parents. The week that happened, one weekend my sister's boyfriend came, we had arrived from visiting my grandfather so we were very tired, my parents fell asleep and my nephew was lying in a room where there are two beds, in one he and my sister sleep and in another I sleep, and well my sister's boyfriend arrived and they went to sleep in my bed because my nephew was in the other, I didn't have much battery in my cell phone and my charger was in my room, which is basically my sister's and mine's room, I went in as if nothing had happened, and I found my sister and her partner having sex, I was shocked, I didn't expect to go in and for them to be in that position, so I grabbed my charger and went out, I waited for that my parents got up and I told them what I saw, they didn't believe me, they didn't think that my sister was so shameless to do that in her own house and in front of her sleeping son, the next day my mother asked her to tell her the truth and she lied to her saying that the person who said that was a liar, and that then she was going to do like me, taking care of me from getting pregnant and injecting me with contraceptive methods which, well, I have never injected myself, I have only taken pills to control the colic, which implied that she had had unprotected sex, and in her own words she said ""I don't think I'll get pregnant because he can't have a family"" which no one knows if it's true or not since he didn't show her any paper confirming it and now her boyfriend makes faces at me every time he sees me because I'm a ""gossip."" My intention was never to be a gossip, I was simply worried that my nephew might wake up and see them in that uncomfortable position, but according to my boyfriend I've never noticed that my sister's boyfriend sees my butt and breasts when I wear tight clothes, which is very unusual but he still does it, so many have told me that my sister is probably jealous of me, what do you think?",1,1764037873.0,family,1,1.0,False

1p60sep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1p60sep/councils_academy_the_lycan_brothers_gifted_mate/,Council's Academy: The Lycan Brothers Gifted Mate,"I only have thirty minutes left before I have to report to the kitchen for my duties. I glance at the tombstone one more time before I head back to the Pack-house, feeling sad as I always do after visiting my Mother's grave.

My Mom isn't buried there, but Dad placed the tombstone to give us both a place to go to. No one seems to know where her grave is, as she died miles away from here. Mom and Dad had been running from her parents, who didn’t agree with her accepting her fated Mate.

Dad barely escaped with me, and when we came to this Pack, I was only a year old. Dad took the position of Assassin, as it was his birthright.

We were happy until I turned fourteen, and he was told I had to move into the Pack-house, waiting to be chosen by unmated males. Every female over fourteen in this Pack had to follow this rule. If my Father had known, he would have never joined this Pack—he would’ve kept running with me.

In the almost three years since I had to move into the Pack-house, I have been working in the kitchen, something I will keep doing after my Mate selects me.

""Umayza, I need you to—"" Luna's voice trails off as she frantically searches the kitchen, not realizing I'm standing right behind her. I step forward and clear my throat.

Startled, she spins around. ""Where did you come from?""

""I've been at my station since my shift started, Luna,"" I reply, noticing she brought another young female to replace me in the kitchen.

This is the day I've been dreading for the past three years—the day I get fitted for the outfit I'll wear in six months, a day I fear even more. Nearly every female in our Pack dreads that day, except maybe the High-ranking ones.

Like me, every girl in the Pack gets fitted for an outfit when she turns seventeen, then has six months to learn a dance to perform in front of all the unmated males. On that night, any male can inform the Alpha if he wants you as his Mate.

High-ranking females perform for a much smaller audience, since there are fewer unmated High-ranking males left. In my case, I should be performing for the Highest ranks as well, but for some reason, our Alpha decided I'd have a better chance if I perform for the general unmated males instead.

Most of them are fine, but there are a few I wouldn't describe as okay—and with me, most females feel that way. I have tried to get out of this performance, but our Alpha wouldn't hear of it, and Dad pleading with him didn’t work either.

Dad doesn't like the way this Pack chooses their Mates, and Dad doesn't participate in the process. He told me that he is working on a plan to get out of here. He doesn't want me to have to go through this process, and according to Dad, it is even illegal.

Until Dad can find a way out of this, I will play along with their charade, and as an Assassin's Daughter, I have mastered looking innocent to perfection—not that I am innocent at all. I have seen enough since I was moved into the Pack-house, and if I ever get the chance, I will take the Alpha and this Pack down.

Our Luna is waiting for me to step into the room where this whole ordeal will start, and I look around at all the fabric and drawings in the room. One outfit is more revealing than the other, and I want to run as our Luna holds the drawing of my outfit in front of me.

""They designed this especially for you, Umayza. It will be in scarlet red, made from lace and silk,"" Luna explains as I take a closer look. It looks more like a nightgown, and I don't think it is suited for a girl my age.

That evening, I finally see Dad for the first time in three days, and I tell him I had my measurements taken for my outfit. ""It is knee-length with a flaring silk skirt and a lace top. The V-neck is almost down to my waist, and there are triangles of fabric behind the lace where my breasts will be. Two little buttons will fasten the lace on my back, and other than that, it is a bare back.""

Dad looks disgusted as I describe the dress to him.

He tells me he has a few more things to take care of before we can leave this Pack, but he will make sure it happens in the next few weeks. I tell him he has at least six months until we have to leave.

Weeks pass as I continue working in the kitchen, fitting my so-called dress, and rehearsing the dance.

Today, I have a sinking feeling that something bad is about to happen.

We have to eat in the dining room with the unmated males, and we always have to sit in the same seat. The only thing that changes is the males we sit between during a day.

As I place bowls of fruit on the tables, I realize my fears were right: I'm seated next to the cruelest male in the Pack.

Every female avoids him due to the rumors about his previous two Mates. It's said that he kept them locked up in his cottage, isolated them from their friends and the rest of the Pack.

Rumors also say that he is abusive, both physically and mentally, and that either he killed them or they took their own lives—stories vary with every person who tells them.

I've noticed him glancing at me from time to time, and today I have to sit right next to him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I hope he'll ignore me like most males do, but I'm afraid I won't be that lucky this time.

Our Alpha instructs us to take our seats, and I reluctantly sit down. As unmated males sit beside me, I keep my eyes on my plate. When the signal is given to start eating, I notice my nightmare placing a bowl of fruit in front of me. I quietly thank him as I take the bowl from his hands.

Neither male speaks to me during breakfast, and I feel relieved when I return to the kitchen. I spend my break in my room, reviewing everything Dad and I discussed over the past two weeks, before heading back to work.

Lunch is similar to breakfast, and as I make my way to the ballroom, I hear our Luna is already present. Over the years, I've learned to distinguish her laughter, and this one signals trouble for whoever is involved.

I stop beside the door, which they left ajar, unsure if they expect me yet, as I usually arrive ten minutes later.

""Does Umayza suspect this is a setup?"" one of the other females asks, and I want to scream, No.

""Of course not. She's as gullible as her Father was when he arrived here. They have no idea he requested the Alpha to put her in the other group, and he'll make sure she never finds out. He'll have his fun with her, but I hope she'll last longer than the others did.

His first Mate disappeared within a year, and his second Mate within two years. But you know, I don't care—he only picks females not born in this Pack,"" Luna responds. I quickly walk away until I am out of hearing range.

My heart races with a surge of dread and revulsion. To feign ignorance, I put on a light expression and start humming as I walk towards the ballroom again.

""Hello, Luna,"" I greet as I walk into the ballroom, only to stop dead in my tracks when I see my so-called dress ready.

""Umayza, today you will rehearse in your outfit,"" Luna says, holding the dress out to me. There's something in her eyes that tells me she's up to something.

Chapter 2 Conviction

Umayza

""Luna, I think there's been a mistake with my measurements. This is way too short,"" I protest after I change into my outfit.

The dress, now altered, barely covers my body. I can't help but worry that a simple turn will expose my panties to everyone.

""No, it's perfect for you,"" Luna says with a cold smile. ""I want to make sure that you find a Mate, and I don't want any of our High-ranking members to pick you. When someone requested you be placed in this group, I convinced my Mate it was for the best. I never wanted your Father or you to join our Pack.""

She states this, and I see there are at least five Warriors present—something that is normally not allowed during rehearsal.

I stare at our Luna as she starts laughing, and I finally realize she actually hates me, for whatever reason that might be.

Without thinking further, I lunge at her, my fist connecting with her nose in a sharp, resounding crack.

Two Warriors immediately seize me, pulling me away before I can do any more harm. One of the High-ranking females steps forward, her gaze icy. ""You've assaulted your Luna, and for that, you will be convicted."" She looks at everyone in the room, and they all agree with her.

The Luna has a smirk on her face as the Warriors drag me down to the dungeons.

An hour later, my Father arrives at the dungeon. There is no worry in his eyes as he says, ""Be patient. Everything will be alright.""

Whenever Dad says that, I know something unexpected is about to happen. It's something his Father taught him, and so far, it always turns out well.

I nod my head as I see my nightmare coming down the stairs.

His eyes move up and down my body, and the look he gives me sends shivers down my spine.

When Dad notices my discomfort, he turns around. ""Stay away from her,"" he growls at the man.

Dad pulls a chair in front of my cell and keeps his eyes on my nightmare. One of the Warriors standing guard grabs a sheet from a shelf and hands it to me through the bars.

I thank him as I wrap the sheet around myself.

We talk about everything that won’t give away that something is going to happen—the latest book I read, the show he watched on TV the other night. We talk about Mom and how much I resemble her. I have her light brown hair and chocolate brown eyes.

About an hour after dinner, our Alpha walks in with two huge males behind him, and I can tell they are Lycans.

Dad gives me a reassuring smile as I look at him. Apparently, this is my ticket out of here, and for some reason, our Alpha is not pleased.

Both males are about 6'3"" with blond hair and blue eyes. Anyone can see that they are twins, and if I had to bet on it, I would say they are High-ranking Lycans.

""Open her cell,"" one of the males says to a Warrior, and our Alpha just nods, though he looks like he wants to object.

""You are charged with assaulting your Luna. The Council has ordered us to bring you to the Academy,"" the same male tells me.

""You can leave the sheet in your cell,"" the other male says, and with some fright in my eyes, I look at Dad.

""Gentlemen, my Daughter was in a fitting session at the time of the attack. I brought her a change of clothes, as I know she won't be comfortable in what she's wearing under that sheet,"" Dad says.

I see both males looking from me to Dad, so I decide to show them what I am wearing.

I turn in such a way that only they can see what is underneath the sheet, and I see anger flashing through their eyes.

They order everyone out and tell Dad to hand me the bag with clothes he brought for me. Then, they all walk out of the dungeons.

Ten minutes later, one of the Lycans walks back in and tells me to follow him.

Dad is waiting outside with the other Lycan. He hugs me as he whispers in my ear that we will meet soon. I kiss him on his cheek before I follow one of the Lycans to a black SUV.

The young female who has been covering my station these past few weeks smiles at me, and I get a feeling that she called in my conviction to the Council. Within seconds, the other Lycan gets behind the wheel.

Just as he turns the ignition on, my nightmare jumps in front of the SUV.

Our Alpha quickly pulls him away, and they start arguing as the SUV passes them. I sigh in relief. I know both males heard it, but they don't say a word as we leave the Pack grounds behind us.

I close my eyes and lean back into the car seat, letting the events of the past day run through my mind.

I have a sinking feeling my nightmare won't give up easily, and I wonder if I should tell the men in the front seats about him.

As my thoughts race, sleep takes over.

Shouting startles me awake. I am very disoriented as I try to figure out what is going on.

""Damn it, Evander! Keep your eyes on the road. I'll see where they're coming from!"" the passenger yells. I glance to my left as I see him looking to the right.

""Left,"" I say, spotting a wolf emerging from the tree line. Evander swerves, barely avoiding the charging wolf.

I recognize the wolf instantly, and a cold certainty settles over me—this won't end until he's dead.

""I know this isn't the time to tell you my life story, but that wolf won't stop until he has me or he's dead,"" I say, my voice tight.

For a moment, the wolf seems to vanish, leaving a strange knot in my stomach. I scan the area, turning my head left and right, trying to spot him again. Up front, the men debate whether to take a detour to shake him off.

""Conri, call Council-member Boaz and ask what we should do about this wolf. Also, tell him he's after the convict we have in the SUV,"" Evander says, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. I keep scanning the surroundings, hoping the wolf doesn't show up again.

""Boaz wants us to head to one of the safe-houses. They'll hold a conference call to hear her story,"" Conri says after ending the call. ""They don't want to wait until she reaches the Academy. After that, they'll decide what to do about the wolf.""

Conri explains that the Council has safe-houses all over the country within the grounds of allied Packs. They plan to take me to the nearest one, where I'll get a chance to tell the Council what happened.

I continue scanning the area, but so far, my nightmare hasn't reappeared. I start to relax a little, though my Father's lessons keep me alert, even after we arrive at the Pack where we'll be staying for a few hours.

Evander drives past the Pack-house, quickly leaving the Pack village behind. He stops in front of a small cottage hidden among tall trees. I realize I would never have found this place on my own if Evander didn't know where to go.

Conri opens the door and extends a hand to help me out. At 5'7"", I feel pretty small standing next to him, and when Evander joins us, I get an irrational urge to run. But without my wolf, I know I wouldn't stand a chance.

It'll take another year before I get my wolf and can shift—maybe then I'll be able to outrun them.

I glance up at both of them and suddenly burst into laughter, realizing I'd never outrun them, even with my wolf.

They both look at me, confused.

""Sorry,"" I chuckle. ""I just realized that even with my wolf, there's no way I'd outrun the two of you.""

Thankfully, they have a sense of humor and laugh along with me.

Chapter 3 Evander

Evander

""Gentlemen, we just received a call from Bright Moon Pack. One of their members was accused and convicted of assaulting their Luna, and we need you to go pick her up. We weren't given many details, but the caller did mention that we needed to act quickly. She sounded pretty fearful, and she told us not to trust the Alpha and Luna about what happened—that we needed to hear her story as well,"" Council-member Boaz says.

Conri and I nod our heads as we get up from our seats, and we waste no time getting to our SUV.

""Evander, any thoughts as to why this person was asking the Council to react fast?"" Conri asks me, and I let the little information we have pass through my mind. It is not much, and I understand why Conri is asking me this question, considering the past.

My mind travels back to another assignment we did for the Council—a young woman had been accused and convicted by the Pack, and a Warrior had called the Council to inform them. When we arrived at the Pack, the Alpha had sworn up and down it had been a misunderstanding, and we contacted the Council on how to proceed.

We were told to head back to the Academy and leave the punishment up to the Alpha, as it had been a minor incident according to him. A month later, a neighboring Pack had contacted the Council that a female had asked for asylum—she was more dead than alive at that time.

When the Council was informed of the circumstances, they had realized it was the female we had been sent for, and Conri and I had been sent back to talk to her. During our conversation, we found out that if we had talked to her that day, we would have taken her with us.

To this day, we regret not talking to her, not saving her, and she made us promise with her dying breath that we would never walk away until we had heard both sides of the story. The Council allowed our Squad Captain Armand and the rest of our team to join us, and we were joined by Investigator Harlyn.

Together, we had managed to find the evidence against the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Turns out that the female had been the Alpha's Daughter, but he had never treated her as such, and his Beta and Gamma had taken liberties with her for years.

The Warrior who had called the Council had accused her on purpose—he had hoped to get her out of the situation she was in before it would end her life, and if we hadn't listened to the Alpha, he would have succeeded in rescuing her.

Conri pulls me from my thoughts as he asks again if I have any idea why the Council was asked to act quickly. ""We know it involves a female, and there are a number of reasons why a female would attack a Luna. Most of those reasons are enough to get convicted by the Council as well, so we can assume that it is not a standard reason,"" I say.

I let him think on my words as we drive towards Bright Moon Pack.

By the time we get there, we still haven't narrowed down the answer, and I am afraid we may never find out, as we will not be there when she has to face the Council. Maybe we will get the chance to ask her on the way back.

The Alpha is not too pleased with our presence—he actually looks really uncomfortable—and as we follow him to the dungeons, I hear Conri through our mind-link: ""I think the caller was right; it is a good thing we came this soon."" I believe he is correct in his assumption.

The girl in the cell is gorgeous, and I can see that the male with her is related to her. I see an uncomfortable look on her face after I tell her to leave the sheet behind. Once she realizes we don't understand her concerns, she turns her back on the others and reveals what she is wearing. I quickly understand her discomfort, and I order everyone out as I tell her to get changed.

The girl is wearing a dress that barely covers her, and the top is mostly see-through. I groan inwardly as I take in how she looks. ""Fuck, Evander. What the hell is she wearing? There is no way I will let her walk out of here dressed like that,"" Conri says.

As we are waiting outside, the Alpha orders the Warriors to follow him to the Pack-house. Her Father looks around before he turns to us and hands me a piece of paper. ""Give this to my Daughter once she is safe and the Council gives you permission,"" he says. I peek inside to see a number written down.

I nod my head before I push it into my pocket. Conri walks back into the dungeons after ten minutes to take the girl to our SUV, and I see Pack-members gathering as Conri guides her over to the SUV.

One member looks murderous, while another has a small smile on her face, and I think I just found out who the girl's guardian angel is. But I don't understand why the male looks as if we took his Mate away from him. Unless, of course, she is his underaged Mate—that would explain his expression.

But if she is his Mate, then why didn't he say anything? Or why was he not with her in the dungeon? I only have more questions than answers, and I need to talk to Conri about this. I also need to inform the Council about my thoughts, and I hope they will be able to help her.

The Alpha pulls the idiot out of the way so I can drive off with the girl in the backseat, and as I look in the rearview mirror, she closes her eyes. Within minutes, she is fast asleep. It gives me the chance to tell Conri my thoughts, and he quickly relays everything to the Council through an email.

""What do you think that piece of fabric was about?"" Conri asks me, and I think back on the minuscule, red dress she had been wearing, cursing at Conri for putting that picture back in my head. I thought she had been gorgeous with that sheet wrapped around her, but seeing her in that dress...

I shake my head as if I can get rid of the image that way, and from the corner of my eye, I see that Conri isn't doing much better. The sight of her in that dress affects both of us. We both softly chuckle as we adjust ourselves, and I keep an eye on our passenger.

A movement on the right side of the SUV pulls my attention away from her, and Conri is on high alert as he looks out the window, but there is nothing to see out there. I curse as something flies over the hood of the SUV, and Conri follows whatever it was into the forest.

A moment later, I curse loudly as I pull the steering wheel hard to the left—a wolf jumps out of the way in the nick of time, and a moment later, the wolf is back again. ""A rogue on a suicide mission,"" Conri mumbles as we swerve across the road, trying to avoid the wolf.

Conri is shouting at me to keep my eyes on the road, but he can't watch both sides of the SUV at the same time, and I don't want to ram this SUV into a wolf. ""Left,"" I hear from the backseat, and I manage to avoid him once again, but her next words freeze the blood in my veins.

""He won't give up until he has me or until he is dead."" 

Chapter 4 Conri

Evander

It is a whisper, but it is a very clear whisper, and Conri calls Council-member Boaz at my request. We need to know what we can and can't do when it comes to this idiotic wolf, and we need to keep this girl safe at all costs.

Council-member Boaz orders us to go to the nearest safe-house, and I sigh in relief the moment I start to recognize my surroundings. It won't be long before we are at the cottage. I am glad we have been here before, because now no one knows who we brought with us.

It is a one-story cottage surrounded by tall trees and a whole variety of wildflowers. There are two bedrooms at the back, and that is more than enough to accommodate us tonight. As Conri stands next to her, I realize that she isn't tall, and we both tower over her.

She hasn't lost her sense of humor as she tells us what ran through her mind, and I chuckle as I try to imagine her running away from us. My Lycan starts to chuckle at that image. Conri guides her into the cottage as I grab the bag from the SUV—her Father gave it to me after Conri left us to get her from the dungeon.

My Lycan has been acting strange for the past two days, and he is starting to annoy the hell out of me. Conri told me that his Lycan was no better. Neither of our Lycans are able to tell us why they act the way they do, nor can they explain what it is they are feeling.

Tomorrow will be the first day of the Full Moon, and I have a suspicion our Lycans are hoping to find their Mate. We have been waiting long enough for her. We have been waiting for her for thirty years, and Conri and I are close to giving up hope.

With every year that passes, my Lycan starts to get more depressed, but every time I bring up taking a chosen Mate, he blows up in my face, and it takes days before he talks to me again. Conri's Lycan is the same when it comes to our fated Mate and a chosen Mate.

We sometimes talk about it and have a good laugh at their attitude towards a chosen Mate. Conri's Lycan refused to talk to him for a week when Conri once suggested to me that we each take our own chosen Mate—not that he was being serious.

Rummaging in the kitchen pulls me from my thoughts, and I see Conri in the doorway with his arms crossed in front of his chest.

Conri

After I ask my Brother why he thinks she got convicted, I know where his thoughts are going—the same place and time as mine—and I know why the Council chose us to go get this girl. Not that they don’t trust anyone else to do the job, but because of our past experiences.

The Alpha is waiting for us as we stop in front of the Pack-house, and I can tell by the look on his face he is not pleased to see us—not that Evander or I care about that at all. ""Alpha, we received a call that one of your Pack-members attacked your Luna. We are here to bring her in front of the Council,"" I say.

Before the Alpha gets a chance to say anything, his Luna steps forward. ""She hit me in the face and broke my nose,"" she growls angrily, and the Alpha has no choice but to show us where they are holding the girl. On our way to the dungeons, the Alpha tries to convince us that his Luna was overreacting to Umayza’s attack.

""Alpha, Umayza attacked your Luna and broke her nose. There were witnesses to it, and they convicted her of assault. We will take her to the Council for her sentencing,"" I say—not that the Council will sentence anyone without hearing the full story.

Over the years, I have seen males and females brought in front of the Council, and some of them were actually sentenced for their crimes. But most of them had been relocated or given the chance to get revenge for a wrongful conviction. Not that Packs were informed of what happened to the Pack-members we brought in front of the Council.

Squad-members who are sent to get a convicted member from a Pack usually don’t even find out what they were accused of or what their explanation for their crime was. Sometimes we get to hear the story as we bring them to a new Pack, or we escort them towards the Sanctuary.

We walk down the stairs into the dungeons, through a hallway leading us further into the dungeons, and the Alpha opens a door that leads into a small room with one cell. My eyes get drawn to the female inside the cell—her hair in a messy bun on top of her head, and her chocolate brown eyes don’t reveal anything.

My Lycan growls in my head as she shows us what she is wearing under that sheet. I link Evander to tell him I won’t allow her to walk out of there dressed like that. He orders everyone out of the dungeons to give her time to change into something more comfortable for her.

My mind is on Umayza, and I know her appearance affected Evander as much as it did me when I see him adjusting himself after I had asked what that piece of fabric was about. I had quickly shoved it into her bag when her back was turned to me—I wanted the Council to see what it was she had been wearing at the time.

My Lycan is convinced it has something to do with the attack, and I have to agree with him on that. It was a little too revealing for my taste. I think as long as she was standing still there wouldn’t be a problem, but if she moved, it would have revealed more than any male should be able to see.

From the corner of my eye, I see movement, and my yelling at Evander wakes Umayza up. Her eyes are on the left side of the road as I watch the right side of the road. Once I am certain the wolf is gone, I call Council-member Boaz with the information I have, and once he gives the okay, we head for the nearest safe-house.

Despite the situation, she hasn’t lost her sense of humor, and my Lycan shows me an image of us chasing after her. I guide her into the cottage and show her where her room is, but she is more interested in the kitchen. There are fresh fruits and vegetables in the fridge, and I can smell that the Alpha has recently been here.

Looks like the Council warned him we were on our way, and I am glad he put some provisions into the fridge and cupboards before we got here. Umayza seems at ease as she is putting everything she wants on the counter. I watch her as Evander walks into the cottage, and for a moment, he stops to look at what is going on in the kitchen.

He smiles as he walks towards the back of the house with her bag. ""You might want to get the dress out of there—I took it as evidence for the Council,"" I say through the mind-link, and he growls back at me. I chuckle at him, knowing exactly why he growled at me.

Chapter 5 Safe-house

Conri

I hear water running in the shower, and I wait for Evander to get back to the kitchen before I head for the shower myself. Once I am back, Evander asks her if she wants to eat first or if she wants to shower first. ""Food first,"" she says as she places three plates on the kitchen island and takes the seat across from me.

Evander sits down next to me, and we are enjoying the food she has prepared for us. She asks us if anyone knows that we are here, and Evander tells her that the Alpha does, but that he won’t be coming here, as that is the deal the Council made with him.

""None of the Packs come to the safe-house when it is occupied. The Council doesn’t want them to know who is here, and it is for their own protection. If your Alpha was to call here, no one will be able to tell him if you are here or not,"" I explain, and she tells me that that makes sense to her.

Evander and I tell her to take a shower while we clean up the kitchen. At first, she wants to object, but one look at us and she thanks us before she walks to the back of the house. It doesn’t take us long to clean everything up, and I start making coffee for Evander and myself.

I hear her sniffle the air as she walks towards us, and I ask her if she would like some coffee as well. ""Yeah, might keep me awake long enough to answer the questions from the Council,"" she says, and Evander and I chuckle as we know a meeting can be boring at times.

Evander tells her that normally we don’t hear about the charges or why someone committed the alleged crimes—that we hardly ever hear about what triggered them to do what they did—and that in some cases, we are more than curious to find out.

""Well, looks like today is your lucky day, as you will be here when I have to talk to the Council,"" she says, but she doesn’t sound as if it bothers her that we will be hearing everything as well.

Umayza

It is nine in the evening when Evander sets up a laptop for the conference call with the Council. Unlike I had expected, I feel comfortable with the two males next to me, and I know that they will keep me safe while I am with them. Instead of multiple screens popping up for the conference call, there is only one, and I can see the seven Council-members.

Conri introduces the Council-members to me, and Council-member Dayanah tells me that she will be leading the questioning for this investigation. She asks if I want Conri and Evander to leave the cottage. ""That won’t be necessary—they have seen a part of what I need to tell the Council,"" I answer.

Conri sits down to my left as Evander sits down to my right, and for some reason, I feel completely at ease. I don’t feel the anxiety I would feel as I had during one of the meals back in my Pack. I take a deep breath to calm my nerves, and I decide to start my story with how we came to live in Bright Moon Pack.

""My parents were fated Mates, but my maternal Grandparents didn’t approve of my Father, and my parents left Mom’s Pack to be together. However, they were hunted down by my Grandparents, and by the time they finally caught up with my parents, I had already been born. Not that it stopped them from hunting us down—they didn’t even stop after Mom died while protecting me.

Dad kept running until we reached Bright Moon Pack, and Dad was offered the position of Assassin, as that is his rank. Dad was able to build a normal life for us there. It wasn’t until I turned fourteen that we found out this Pack has a rather strange look on Mates—our Alpha doesn’t allow anyone to accept their fated Mate, and anyone that finds their fated Mate is ordered to reject them.

Every female starts living in the Pack-house at the age of fourteen—no exceptions. The unmated females have to stay inside the Pack-house. We were not allowed to go to our family’s homes, and they were allowed a minimum of contact with us at the Pack-house.""

I feel the males next to me get angrier the more I say, and even the Council-members look angry.

""We have to do all the chores in the Pack-house. We prepare the meals for everyone, and when we have our meals, our stations get covered by mated females. During the meals, we sit in assigned seats, and each day, different unmated males sit on either side of us.

When a female turns seventeen, our Luna takes her to a part of the Pack-house we call the fitting room. Your measurements get taken while our Luna picks out a drawing of your outfit, and from that day on, the female has to attend dance classes.

They teach the female a very sensual dance, which you have to perform in front of all the unmated males six months before you turn eighteen. If a male wants to have you as his chosen Mate, he informs our Alpha. There is a ceremony for the High-ranking males and one for the Warriors.

With my Father being our Pack’s Assassin, I normally would have to perform in front of the High-ranking males. But the Wolf that attacked us asked our Alpha to put me in front of the Warriors, as he has an interest in me. I am not sure if our Alpha wanted to grant his request, but on the day I attacked our Luna, she told me she had convinced her Mate to allow it.

She told me she never wanted my Father or me to join the Pack, and this was her way of getting revenge. They also altered my dress to be a lot shorter than it initially was, and when I asked her about it, she told me how she had helped my nightmare to get me in front of him.""

I didn’t look at anyone as I spoke, and my eyes are still on the floor once I am finished.

""Umayza, you had every right to attack her, and we won’t sentence you for this crime. I will send a team to investigate this Pack, because I want to know why the Luna didn’t want you and your Father in her Pack, and we will put a stop to their way of running their Pack.

Is there any way you can contact your Father?"" Council-member Dayanah asks, and I shake my head as I didn’t have my phone with me.

""Council-member Dayanah, her Father handed me a piece of paper with a phone number on it before we left. He asked me to give it to her once she was safe, and if you would allow me to give it to her,"" Evander says.

Council-member Dayanah tells him to give it to me. I smile as I open the piece of paper and recognize my Father’s handwriting.

Chapter 6 Mate

Evander

That my Lycan and I were fuming was putting it mildly, and I could feel through our bond that my Brother wasn’t doing any better. The Council is quick in telling Umayza she will not be sentenced for attacking her Luna, and she releases a sigh of relief.

I don’t understand why some Lycans or Werewolves can be this depraved. The leaders of Bright Moon Pack are really a fry short of a happy meal, and I want to knock some sense into them. Knowing there will be an investigation makes me feel a little better, but not by much.

Council-member Dayanah asks Umayza what she wants to do, and Umayza tells the Council she wants to train to be an Assassin just like her Father—to help the Council get justice for those who can’t get it themselves.

""Umayza, the Council grants you your request. Please call your Father and ask him to report to the Academy as soon as he can. We can use someone with his experience here,"" Council-member Dayanah says. Soon after that, we say our goodbyes to the Council-members.

Umayza looks exhausted, and Conri asks her if she wants to call her Father tonight or tomorrow when we are on our way to the Academy. She opts for the next day as she is struggling to keep her eyes open. Conri guides her to her bedroom as I get some sodas for Conri and myself.

I am proud of Umayza for telling her story to the Council. I can only imagine what it was like growing up in a Pack like that, and I am glad Conri and I grew up in a Pack that values its members. Before I can let my mind wander to White Crescent Pack, Conri walks back into the room.

""She was asleep before she hit the pillow,"" he says with a smile on his face. ""I am glad we grew up in White Crescent Pack. Alpha Atlas was a good and fair Alpha, and Luna Anthea was so sweet. I know Amarah has some big shoes to fill, but I know she will be an excellent Alpha.""

Before I can reply, Conri’s phone starts ringing. When he sees the caller-ID, he puts it on speaker. ""Captain, to what do we owe this pleasure?"" Conri asks, and Captain Armand tells us he and the rest of our Squad will meet us outside the Pack’s territory.

""Knowing a male is after Umayza made Council-member Boaz contact me to come up with a plan to get her safely to the Academy, and Theron has come up with a solid plan. We need clothes that smell like her to put in our SUVs before we all drive away.

There is a fork in the road miles from the Pack that leads in four different directions, and that is where we will all split up to see if we can get rid of him. We will keep in touch by phone, and hopefully you guys can get Umayza to the Academy without further problems,"" Armand says.

Conri tells him he will take care of the clothes they will need. He walks out of the living room, and after I have agreed on our meeting time, I disconnect the call. I stand in front of the window, staring at nothing in particular as Conri walks back into the room. He tells me that he put her clothes under her sheets.

""I left a set on a chair in her room for her to wear tomorrow, and the rest will be divided over the other SUVs. I really hope this will work—I would hate for that idiot to get his hands on her,"" Conri says. As my Lycan roars in my head, his Lycan roars out loud.

""I am going to give Armand her little red dress,"" he says with a smirk on his face, and I groan as the image of Umayza in that outfit pops into my head. My Lycan has a smirk on his face as he says, ""Something to picture when you have to take care of yourself."" I groan again as I quickly block him.",1,1764037823.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

I was fired this last Friday, a week before Thanksgiving for the most ridiculous reason you will ever hear. It all started with stupid Ninox shit, a data collection program on my iPad and I had to go back to some more information and I had to use the iPad which needed to be charged. I was no longer able to charge it in my van because if I ran it more than 15 minutes sitting idle, it would sound the alarm. I was told at this particular property that no one uses this conference room and I could use it while I was working at their facility. It had a coffee maker and other things that made me think this was just another break room/conference room type thing. I went to plug my iPad in, the other plug accidentally fell out, I plugged it back in. Apparently, that plug was the receiver for their main security cameras for the bank. Not hardwired in, no lock, someone can very easily unplug it, or mistakenly knock it out. While I was still at the property for another 2 hours, no one mentioned a single thing. Until a week later, when my boss told me what actually happened and that the fire department and the security company had came out and ALMOST fined them. They did not fine them. Because of that, the company that owns the property no longer wants me to work at their properties, and since that was the biggest cash cow I no longer had a job. I will say my direct manager did fight for me, but this was above his head. I got nothing.

I glance at the tombstone one more time before I head back to the Pack-house, feeling sad as I always do after visiting my Mother's grave.

My Mom isn't buried there, but Dad placed the tombstone to give us both a place to go to. No one seems to know where her grave is, as she died miles away from here. Mom and Dad had been running from her parents, who didn’t agree with her accepting her fated Mate.

Dad barely escaped with me, and when we came to this Pack, I was only a year old. Dad took the position of Assassin, as it was his birthright.

We were happy until I turned fourteen, and he was told I had to move into the Pack-house, waiting to be chosen by unmated males. Every female over fourteen in this Pack had to follow this rule. If my Father had known, he would have never joined this Pack—he would’ve kept running with me.

In the almost three years since I had to move into the Pack-house, I have been working in the kitchen, something I will keep doing after my Mate selects me.

""Umayza, I need you to—"" Luna's voice trails off as she frantically searches the kitchen, not realizing I'm standing right behind her. I step forward and clear my throat.

Startled, she spins around. ""Where did you come from?""

""I've been at my station since my shift started, Luna,"" I reply, noticing she brought another young female to replace me in the kitchen.

This is the day I've been dreading for the past three years—the day I get fitted for the outfit I'll wear in six months, a day I fear even more. Nearly every female in our Pack dreads that day, except maybe the High-ranking ones.

Like me, every girl in the Pack gets fitted for an outfit when she turns seventeen, then has six months to learn a dance to perform in front of all the unmated males. On that night, any male can inform the Alpha if he wants you as his Mate.

High-ranking females perform for a much smaller audience, since there are fewer unmated High-ranking males left. In my case, I should be performing for the Highest ranks as well, but for some reason, our Alpha decided I'd have a better chance if I perform for the general unmated males instead.

Most of them are fine, but there are a few I wouldn't describe as okay—and with me, most females feel that way. I have tried to get out of this performance, but our Alpha wouldn't hear of it, and Dad pleading with him didn’t work either.

Dad doesn't like the way this Pack chooses their Mates, and Dad doesn't participate in the process. He told me that he is working on a plan to get out of here. He doesn't want me to have to go through this process, and according to Dad, it is even illegal.

Until Dad can find a way out of this, I will play along with their charade, and as an Assassin's Daughter, I have mastered looking innocent to perfection—not that I am innocent at all. I have seen enough since I was moved into the Pack-house, and if I ever get the chance, I will take the Alpha and this Pack down.

Our Luna is waiting for me to step into the room where this whole ordeal will start, and I look around at all the fabric and drawings in the room. One outfit is more revealing than the other, and I want to run as our Luna holds the drawing of my outfit in front of me.

""They designed this especially for you, Umayza. It will be in scarlet red, made from lace and silk,"" Luna explains as I take a closer look. It looks more like a nightgown, and I don't think it is suited for a girl my age.

That evening, I finally see Dad for the first time in three days, and I tell him I had my measurements taken for my outfit. ""It is knee-length with a flaring silk skirt and a lace top. The V-neck is almost down to my waist, and there are triangles of fabric behind the lace where my breasts will be. Two little buttons will fasten the lace on my back, and other than that, it is a bare back.""

Dad looks disgusted as I describe the dress to him.

He tells me he has a few more things to take care of before we can leave this Pack, but he will make sure it happens in the next few weeks. I tell him he has at least six months until we have to leave.

Weeks pass as I continue working in the kitchen, fitting my so-called dress, and rehearsing the dance.

Today, I have a sinking feeling that something bad is about to happen.

We have to eat in the dining room with the unmated males, and we always have to sit in the same seat. The only thing that changes is the males we sit between during a day.

As I place bowls of fruit on the tables, I realize my fears were right: I'm seated next to the cruelest male in the Pack.

Every female avoids him due to the rumors about his previous two Mates. It's said that he kept them locked up in his cottage, isolated them from their friends and the rest of the Pack.

Rumors also say that he is abusive, both physically and mentally, and that either he killed them or they took their own lives—stories vary with every person who tells them.

I've noticed him glancing at me from time to time, and today I have to sit right next to him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I hope he'll ignore me like most males do, but I'm afraid I won't be that lucky this time.

Our Alpha instructs us to take our seats, and I reluctantly sit down. As unmated males sit beside me, I keep my eyes on my plate. When the signal is given to start eating, I notice my nightmare placing a bowl of fruit in front of me. I quietly thank him as I take the bowl from his hands.

Neither male speaks to me during breakfast, and I feel relieved when I return to the kitchen. I spend my break in my room, reviewing everything Dad and I discussed over the past two weeks, before heading back to work.

Lunch is similar to breakfast, and as I make my way to the ballroom, I hear our Luna is already present. Over the years, I've learned to distinguish her laughter, and this one signals trouble for whoever is involved.

I stop beside the door, which they left ajar, unsure if they expect me yet, as I usually arrive ten minutes later.

""Does Umayza suspect this is a setup?"" one of the other females asks, and I want to scream, No.

""Of course not. She's as gullible as her Father was when he arrived here. They have no idea he requested the Alpha to put her in the other group, and he'll make sure she never finds out. He'll have his fun with her, but I hope she'll last longer than the others did.

His first Mate disappeared within a year, and his second Mate within two years. But you know, I don't care—he only picks females not born in this Pack,"" Luna responds. I quickly walk away until I am out of hearing range.

My heart races with a surge of dread and revulsion. To feign ignorance, I put on a light expression and start humming as I walk towards the ballroom again.

""Hello, Luna,"" I greet as I walk into the ballroom, only to stop dead in my tracks when I see my so-called dress ready.

""Umayza, today you will rehearse in your outfit,"" Luna says, holding the dress out to me. There's something in her eyes that tells me she's up to something.

Chapter 2 Conviction

Umayza

""Luna, I think there's been a mistake with my measurements. This is way too short,"" I protest after I change into my outfit.

The dress, now altered, barely covers my body. I can't help but worry that a simple turn will expose my panties to everyone.

""No, it's perfect for you,"" Luna says with a cold smile. ""I want to make sure that you find a Mate, and I don't want any of our High-ranking members to pick you. When someone requested you be placed in this group, I convinced my Mate it was for the best. I never wanted your Father or you to join our Pack.""

She states this, and I see there are at least five Warriors present—something that is normally not allowed during rehearsal.

I stare at our Luna as she starts laughing, and I finally realize she actually hates me, for whatever reason that might be.

Without thinking further, I lunge at her, my fist connecting with her nose in a sharp, resounding crack.

Two Warriors immediately seize me, pulling me away before I can do any more harm. One of the High-ranking females steps forward, her gaze icy. ""You've assaulted your Luna, and for that, you will be convicted."" She looks at everyone in the room, and they all agree with her.

The Luna has a smirk on her face as the Warriors drag me down to the dungeons.

An hour later, my Father arrives at the dungeon. There is no worry in his eyes as he says, ""Be patient. Everything will be alright.""

Whenever Dad says that, I know something unexpected is about to happen. It's something his Father taught him, and so far, it always turns out well.

I nod my head as I see my nightmare coming down the stairs.

His eyes move up and down my body, and the look he gives me sends shivers down my spine.

When Dad notices my discomfort, he turns around. ""Stay away from her,"" he growls at the man.

Dad pulls a chair in front of my cell and keeps his eyes on my nightmare. One of the Warriors standing guard grabs a sheet from a shelf and hands it to me through the bars.

I thank him as I wrap the sheet around myself.

We talk about everything that won’t give away that something is going to happen—the latest book I read, the show he watched on TV the other night. We talk about Mom and how much I resemble her. I have her light brown hair and chocolate brown eyes.

About an hour after dinner, our Alpha walks in with two huge males behind him, and I can tell they are Lycans.

Dad gives me a reassuring smile as I look at him. Apparently, this is my ticket out of here, and for some reason, our Alpha is not pleased.

Both males are about 6'3"" with blond hair and blue eyes. Anyone can see that they are twins, and if I had to bet on it, I would say they are High-ranking Lycans.

""Open her cell,"" one of the males says to a Warrior, and our Alpha just nods, though he looks like he wants to object.

""You are charged with assaulting your Luna. The Council has ordered us to bring you to the Academy,"" the same male tells me.

""You can leave the sheet in your cell,"" the other male says, and with some fright in my eyes, I look at Dad.

""Gentlemen, my Daughter was in a fitting session at the time of the attack. I brought her a change of clothes, as I know she won't be comfortable in what she's wearing under that sheet,"" Dad says.

I see both males looking from me to Dad, so I decide to show them what I am wearing.

I turn in such a way that only they can see what is underneath the sheet, and I see anger flashing through their eyes.

They order everyone out and tell Dad to hand me the bag with clothes he brought for me. Then, they all walk out of the dungeons.

Ten minutes later, one of the Lycans walks back in and tells me to follow him.

Dad is waiting outside with the other Lycan. He hugs me as he whispers in my ear that we will meet soon. I kiss him on his cheek before I follow one of the Lycans to a black SUV.

The young female who has been covering my station these past few weeks smiles at me, and I get a feeling that she called in my conviction to the Council. Within seconds, the other Lycan gets behind the wheel.

Just as he turns the ignition on, my nightmare jumps in front of the SUV.

Our Alpha quickly pulls him away, and they start arguing as the SUV passes them. I sigh in relief. I know both males heard it, but they don't say a word as we leave the Pack grounds behind us.

I close my eyes and lean back into the car seat, letting the events of the past day run through my mind.

I have a sinking feeling my nightmare won't give up easily, and I wonder if I should tell the men in the front seats about him.

As my thoughts race, sleep takes over.

Shouting startles me awake. I am very disoriented as I try to figure out what is going on.

""Damn it, Evander! Keep your eyes on the road. I'll see where they're coming from!"" the passenger yells. I glance to my left as I see him looking to the right.

""Left,"" I say, spotting a wolf emerging from the tree line. Evander swerves, barely avoiding the charging wolf.

I recognize the wolf instantly, and a cold certainty settles over me—this won't end until he's dead.

""I know this isn't the time to tell you my life story, but that wolf won't stop until he has me or he's dead,"" I say, my voice tight.

For a moment, the wolf seems to vanish, leaving a strange knot in my stomach. I scan the area, turning my head left and right, trying to spot him again. Up front, the men debate whether to take a detour to shake him off.

""Conri, call Council-member Boaz and ask what we should do about this wolf. Also, tell him he's after the convict we have in the SUV,"" Evander says, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. I keep scanning the surroundings, hoping the wolf doesn't show up again.

""Boaz wants us to head to one of the safe-houses. They'll hold a conference call to hear her story,"" Conri says after ending the call. ""They don't want to wait until she reaches the Academy. After that, they'll decide what to do about the wolf.""

Conri explains that the Council has safe-houses all over the country within the grounds of allied Packs. They plan to take me to the nearest one, where I'll get a chance to tell the Council what happened.

I continue scanning the area, but so far, my nightmare hasn't reappeared. I start to relax a little, though my Father's lessons keep me alert, even after we arrive at the Pack where we'll be staying for a few hours.

Evander drives past the Pack-house, quickly leaving the Pack village behind. He stops in front of a small cottage hidden among tall trees. I realize I would never have found this place on my own if Evander didn't know where to go.

Conri opens the door and extends a hand to help me out. At 5'7"", I feel pretty small standing next to him, and when Evander joins us, I get an irrational urge to run. But without my wolf, I know I wouldn't stand a chance.

It'll take another year before I get my wolf and can shift—maybe then I'll be able to outrun them.

I glance up at both of them and suddenly burst into laughter, realizing I'd never outrun them, even with my wolf.

They both look at me, confused.

""Sorry,"" I chuckle. ""I just realized that even with my wolf, there's no way I'd outrun the two of you.""

Thankfully, they have a sense of humor and laugh along with me.

Chapter 3 Evander

Evander

""Gentlemen, we just received a call from Bright Moon Pack. One of their members was accused and convicted of assaulting their Luna, and we need you to go pick her up. We weren't given many details, but the caller did mention that we needed to act quickly. She sounded pretty fearful, and she told us not to trust the Alpha and Luna about what happened—that we needed to hear her story as well,"" Council-member Boaz says.

Conri and I nod our heads as we get up from our seats, and we waste no time getting to our SUV.

""Evander, any thoughts as to why this person was asking the Council to react fast?"" Conri asks me, and I let the little information we have pass through my mind. It is not much, and I understand why Conri is asking me this question, considering the past.

My mind travels back to another assignment we did for the Council—a young woman had been accused and convicted by the Pack, and a Warrior had called the Council to inform them. When we arrived at the Pack, the Alpha had sworn up and down it had been a misunderstanding, and we contacted the Council on how to proceed.

We were told to head back to the Academy and leave the punishment up to the Alpha, as it had been a minor incident according to him. A month later, a neighboring Pack had contacted the Council that a female had asked for asylum—she was more dead than alive at that time.

When the Council was informed of the circumstances, they had realized it was the female we had been sent for, and Conri and I had been sent back to talk to her. During our conversation, we found out that if we had talked to her that day, we would have taken her with us.

To this day, we regret not talking to her, not saving her, and she made us promise with her dying breath that we would never walk away until we had heard both sides of the story. The Council allowed our Squad Captain Armand and the rest of our team to join us, and we were joined by Investigator Harlyn.

Together, we had managed to find the evidence against the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Turns out that the female had been the Alpha's Daughter, but he had never treated her as such, and his Beta and Gamma had taken liberties with her for years.

The Warrior who had called the Council had accused her on purpose—he had hoped to get her out of the situation she was in before it would end her life, and if we hadn't listened to the Alpha, he would have succeeded in rescuing her.

Conri pulls me from my thoughts as he asks again if I have any idea why the Council was asked to act quickly. ""We know it involves a female, and there are a number of reasons why a female would attack a Luna. Most of those reasons are enough to get convicted by the Council as well, so we can assume that it is not a standard reason,"" I say.

I let him think on my words as we drive towards Bright Moon Pack.

By the time we get there, we still haven't narrowed down the answer, and I am afraid we may never find out, as we will not be there when she has to face the Council. Maybe we will get the chance to ask her on the way back.

The Alpha is not too pleased with our presence—he actually looks really uncomfortable—and as we follow him to the dungeons, I hear Conri through our mind-link: ""I think the caller was right; it is a good thing we came this soon."" I believe he is correct in his assumption.

The girl in the cell is gorgeous, and I can see that the male with her is related to her. I see an uncomfortable look on her face after I tell her to leave the sheet behind. Once she realizes we don't understand her concerns, she turns her back on the others and reveals what she is wearing. I quickly understand her discomfort, and I order everyone out as I tell her to get changed.

The girl is wearing a dress that barely covers her, and the top is mostly see-through. I groan inwardly as I take in how she looks. ""Fuck, Evander. What the hell is she wearing? There is no way I will let her walk out of here dressed like that,"" Conri says.

As we are waiting outside, the Alpha orders the Warriors to follow him to the Pack-house. Her Father looks around before he turns to us and hands me a piece of paper. ""Give this to my Daughter once she is safe and the Council gives you permission,"" he says. I peek inside to see a number written down.

I nod my head before I push it into my pocket. Conri walks back into the dungeons after ten minutes to take the girl to our SUV, and I see Pack-members gathering as Conri guides her over to the SUV.

One member looks murderous, while another has a small smile on her face, and I think I just found out who the girl's guardian angel is. But I don't understand why the male looks as if we took his Mate away from him. Unless, of course, she is his underaged Mate—that would explain his expression.

But if she is his Mate, then why didn't he say anything? Or why was he not with her in the dungeon? I only have more questions than answers, and I need to talk to Conri about this. I also need to inform the Council about my thoughts, and I hope they will be able to help her.

The Alpha pulls the idiot out of the way so I can drive off with the girl in the backseat, and as I look in the rearview mirror, she closes her eyes. Within minutes, she is fast asleep. It gives me the chance to tell Conri my thoughts, and he quickly relays everything to the Council through an email.

""What do you think that piece of fabric was about?"" Conri asks me, and I think back on the minuscule, red dress she had been wearing, cursing at Conri for putting that picture back in my head. I thought she had been gorgeous with that sheet wrapped around her, but seeing her in that dress...

I shake my head as if I can get rid of the image that way, and from the corner of my eye, I see that Conri isn't doing much better. The sight of her in that dress affects both of us. We both softly chuckle as we adjust ourselves, and I keep an eye on our passenger.

A movement on the right side of the SUV pulls my attention away from her, and Conri is on high alert as he looks out the window, but there is nothing to see out there. I curse as something flies over the hood of the SUV, and Conri follows whatever it was into the forest.

A moment later, I curse loudly as I pull the steering wheel hard to the left—a wolf jumps out of the way in the nick of time, and a moment later, the wolf is back again. ""A rogue on a suicide mission,"" Conri mumbles as we swerve across the road, trying to avoid the wolf.

Conri is shouting at me to keep my eyes on the road, but he can't watch both sides of the SUV at the same time, and I don't want to ram this SUV into a wolf. ""Left,"" I hear from the backseat, and I manage to avoid him once again, but her next words freeze the blood in my veins.

""He won't give up until he has me or until he is dead."" 

Chapter 4 Conri

Evander

It is a whisper, but it is a very clear whisper, and Conri calls Council-member Boaz at my request. We need to know what we can and can't do when it comes to this idiotic wolf, and we need to keep this girl safe at all costs.

Council-member Boaz orders us to go to the nearest safe-house, and I sigh in relief the moment I start to recognize my surroundings. It won't be long before we are at the cottage. I am glad we have been here before, because now no one knows who we brought with us.

It is a one-story cottage surrounded by tall trees and a whole variety of wildflowers. There are two bedrooms at the back, and that is more than enough to accommodate us tonight. As Conri stands next to her, I realize that she isn't tall, and we both tower over her.

She hasn't lost her sense of humor as she tells us what ran through her mind, and I chuckle as I try to imagine her running away from us. My Lycan starts to chuckle at that image. Conri guides her into the cottage as I grab the bag from the SUV—her Father gave it to me after Conri left us to get her from the dungeon.

My Lycan has been acting strange for the past two days, and he is starting to annoy the hell out of me. Conri told me that his Lycan was no better. Neither of our Lycans are able to tell us why they act the way they do, nor can they explain what it is they are feeling.

Tomorrow will be the first day of the Full Moon, and I have a suspicion our Lycans are hoping to find their Mate. We have been waiting long enough for her. We have been waiting for her for thirty years, and Conri and I are close to giving up hope.

With every year that passes, my Lycan starts to get more depressed, but every time I bring up taking a chosen Mate, he blows up in my face, and it takes days before he talks to me again. Conri's Lycan is the same when it comes to our fated Mate and a chosen Mate.

We sometimes talk about it and have a good laugh at their attitude towards a chosen Mate. Conri's Lycan refused to talk to him for a week when Conri once suggested to me that we each take our own chosen Mate—not that he was being serious.

Rummaging in the kitchen pulls me from my thoughts, and I see Conri in the doorway with his arms crossed in front of his chest.

Conri

After I ask my Brother why he thinks she got convicted, I know where his thoughts are going—the same place and time as mine—and I know why the Council chose us to go get this girl. Not that they don’t trust anyone else to do the job, but because of our past experiences.

The Alpha is waiting for us as we stop in front of the Pack-house, and I can tell by the look on his face he is not pleased to see us—not that Evander or I care about that at all. ""Alpha, we received a call that one of your Pack-members attacked your Luna. We are here to bring her in front of the Council,"" I say.

Before the Alpha gets a chance to say anything, his Luna steps forward. ""She hit me in the face and broke my nose,"" she growls angrily, and the Alpha has no choice but to show us where they are holding the girl. On our way to the dungeons, the Alpha tries to convince us that his Luna was overreacting to Umayza’s attack.

""Alpha, Umayza attacked your Luna and broke her nose. There were witnesses to it, and they convicted her of assault. We will take her to the Council for her sentencing,"" I say—not that the Council will sentence anyone without hearing the full story.

Over the years, I have seen males and females brought in front of the Council, and some of them were actually sentenced for their crimes. But most of them had been relocated or given the chance to get revenge for a wrongful conviction. Not that Packs were informed of what happened to the Pack-members we brought in front of the Council.

Squad-members who are sent to get a convicted member from a Pack usually don’t even find out what they were accused of or what their explanation for their crime was. Sometimes we get to hear the story as we bring them to a new Pack, or we escort them towards the Sanctuary.

We walk down the stairs into the dungeons, through a hallway leading us further into the dungeons, and the Alpha opens a door that leads into a small room with one cell. My eyes get drawn to the female inside the cell—her hair in a messy bun on top of her head, and her chocolate brown eyes don’t reveal anything.

My Lycan growls in my head as she shows us what she is wearing under that sheet. I link Evander to tell him I won’t allow her to walk out of there dressed like that. He orders everyone out of the dungeons to give her time to change into something more comfortable for her.

My mind is on Umayza, and I know her appearance affected Evander as much as it did me when I see him adjusting himself after I had asked what that piece of fabric was about. I had quickly shoved it into her bag when her back was turned to me—I wanted the Council to see what it was she had been wearing at the time.

My Lycan is convinced it has something to do with the attack, and I have to agree with him on that. It was a little too revealing for my taste. I think as long as she was standing still there wouldn’t be a problem, but if she moved, it would have revealed more than any male should be able to see.

From the corner of my eye, I see movement, and my yelling at Evander wakes Umayza up. Her eyes are on the left side of the road as I watch the right side of the road. Once I am certain the wolf is gone, I call Council-member Boaz with the information I have, and once he gives the okay, we head for the nearest safe-house.

Despite the situation, she hasn’t lost her sense of humor, and my Lycan shows me an image of us chasing after her. I guide her into the cottage and show her where her room is, but she is more interested in the kitchen. There are fresh fruits and vegetables in the fridge, and I can smell that the Alpha has recently been here.

Looks like the Council warned him we were on our way, and I am glad he put some provisions into the fridge and cupboards before we got here. Umayza seems at ease as she is putting everything she wants on the counter. I watch her as Evander walks into the cottage, and for a moment, he stops to look at what is going on in the kitchen.

He smiles as he walks towards the back of the house with her bag. ""You might want to get the dress out of there—I took it as evidence for the Council,"" I say through the mind-link, and he growls back at me. I chuckle at him, knowing exactly why he growled at me.

Chapter 5 Safe-house

Conri

I hear water running in the shower, and I wait for Evander to get back to the kitchen before I head for the shower myself. Once I am back, Evander asks her if she wants to eat first or if she wants to shower first. ""Food first,"" she says as she places three plates on the kitchen island and takes the seat across from me.

Evander sits down next to me, and we are enjoying the food she has prepared for us. She asks us if anyone knows that we are here, and Evander tells her that the Alpha does, but that he won’t be coming here, as that is the deal the Council made with him.

""None of the Packs come to the safe-house when it is occupied. The Council doesn’t want them to know who is here, and it is for their own protection. If your Alpha was to call here, no one will be able to tell him if you are here or not,"" I explain, and she tells me that that makes sense to her.

Evander and I tell her to take a shower while we clean up the kitchen. At first, she wants to object, but one look at us and she thanks us before she walks to the back of the house. It doesn’t take us long to clean everything up, and I start making coffee for Evander and myself.

I hear her sniffle the air as she walks towards us, and I ask her if she would like some coffee as well. ""Yeah, might keep me awake long enough to answer the questions from the Council,"" she says, and Evander and I chuckle as we know a meeting can be boring at times.

Evander tells her that normally we don’t hear about the charges or why someone committed the alleged crimes—that we hardly ever hear about what triggered them to do what they did—and that in some cases, we are more than curious to find out.

""Well, looks like today is your lucky day, as you will be here when I have to talk to the Council,"" she says, but she doesn’t sound as if it bothers her that we will be hearing everything as well.

Umayza

It is nine in the evening when Evander sets up a laptop for the conference call with the Council. Unlike I had expected, I feel comfortable with the two males next to me, and I know that they will keep me safe while I am with them. Instead of multiple screens popping up for the conference call, there is only one, and I can see the seven Council-members.

Conri introduces the Council-members to me, and Council-member Dayanah tells me that she will be leading the questioning for this investigation. She asks if I want Conri and Evander to leave the cottage. ""That won’t be necessary—they have seen a part of what I need to tell the Council,"" I answer.

Conri sits down to my left as Evander sits down to my right, and for some reason, I feel completely at ease. I don’t feel the anxiety I would feel as I had during one of the meals back in my Pack. I take a deep breath to calm my nerves, and I decide to start my story with how we came to live in Bright Moon Pack.

""My parents were fated Mates, but my maternal Grandparents didn’t approve of my Father, and my parents left Mom’s Pack to be together. However, they were hunted down by my Grandparents, and by the time they finally caught up with my parents, I had already been born. Not that it stopped them from hunting us down—they didn’t even stop after Mom died while protecting me.

Dad kept running until we reached Bright Moon Pack, and Dad was offered the position of Assassin, as that is his rank. Dad was able to build a normal life for us there. It wasn’t until I turned fourteen that we found out this Pack has a rather strange look on Mates—our Alpha doesn’t allow anyone to accept their fated Mate, and anyone that finds their fated Mate is ordered to reject them.

Every female starts living in the Pack-house at the age of fourteen—no exceptions. The unmated females have to stay inside the Pack-house. We were not allowed to go to our family’s homes, and they were allowed a minimum of contact with us at the Pack-house.""

I feel the males next to me get angrier the more I say, and even the Council-members look angry.

""We have to do all the chores in the Pack-house. We prepare the meals for everyone, and when we have our meals, our stations get covered by mated females. During the meals, we sit in assigned seats, and each day, different unmated males sit on either side of us.

When a female turns seventeen, our Luna takes her to a part of the Pack-house we call the fitting room. Your measurements get taken while our Luna picks out a drawing of your outfit, and from that day on, the female has to attend dance classes.

They teach the female a very sensual dance, which you have to perform in front of all the unmated males six months before you turn eighteen. If a male wants to have you as his chosen Mate, he informs our Alpha. There is a ceremony for the High-ranking males and one for the Warriors.

With my Father being our Pack’s Assassin, I normally would have to perform in front of the High-ranking males. But the Wolf that attacked us asked our Alpha to put me in front of the Warriors, as he has an interest in me. I am not sure if our Alpha wanted to grant his request, but on the day I attacked our Luna, she told me she had convinced her Mate to allow it.

She told me she never wanted my Father or me to join the Pack, and this was her way of getting revenge. They also altered my dress to be a lot shorter than it initially was, and when I asked her about it, she told me how she had helped my nightmare to get me in front of him.""

I didn’t look at anyone as I spoke, and my eyes are still on the floor once I am finished.

""Umayza, you had every right to attack her, and we won’t sentence you for this crime. I will send a team to investigate this Pack, because I want to know why the Luna didn’t want you and your Father in her Pack, and we will put a stop to their way of running their Pack.

Is there any way you can contact your Father?"" Council-member Dayanah asks, and I shake my head as I didn’t have my phone with me.

""Council-member Dayanah, her Father handed me a piece of paper with a phone number on it before we left. He asked me to give it to her once she was safe, and if you would allow me to give it to her,"" Evander says.

Council-member Dayanah tells him to give it to me. I smile as I open the piece of paper and recognize my Father’s handwriting.

Chapter 6 Mate

Evander

That my Lycan and I were fuming was putting it mildly, and I could feel through our bond that my Brother wasn’t doing any better. The Council is quick in telling Umayza she will not be sentenced for attacking her Luna, and she releases a sigh of relief.

I don’t understand why some Lycans or Werewolves can be this depraved. The leaders of Bright Moon Pack are really a fry short of a happy meal, and I want to knock some sense into them. Knowing there will be an investigation makes me feel a little better, but not by much.

Council-member Dayanah asks Umayza what she wants to do, and Umayza tells the Council she wants to train to be an Assassin just like her Father—to help the Council get justice for those who can’t get it themselves.

""Umayza, the Council grants you your request. Please call your Father and ask him to report to the Academy as soon as he can. We can use someone with his experience here,"" Council-member Dayanah says. Soon after that, we say our goodbyes to the Council-members.

Umayza looks exhausted, and Conri asks her if she wants to call her Father tonight or tomorrow when we are on our way to the Academy. She opts for the next day as she is struggling to keep her eyes open. Conri guides her to her bedroom as I get some sodas for Conri and myself.

I am proud of Umayza for telling her story to the Council. I can only imagine what it was like growing up in a Pack like that, and I am glad Conri and I grew up in a Pack that values its members. Before I can let my mind wander to White Crescent Pack, Conri walks back into the room.

""She was asleep before she hit the pillow,"" he says with a smile on his face. ""I am glad we grew up in White Crescent Pack. Alpha Atlas was a good and fair Alpha, and Luna Anthea was so sweet. I know Amarah has some big shoes to fill, but I know she will be an excellent Alpha.""

Before I can reply, Conri’s phone starts ringing. When he sees the caller-ID, he puts it on speaker. ""Captain, to what do we owe this pleasure?"" Conri asks, and Captain Armand tells us he and the rest of our Squad will meet us outside the Pack’s territory.

""Knowing a male is after Umayza made Council-member Boaz contact me to come up with a plan to get her safely to the Academy, and Theron has come up with a solid plan. We need clothes that smell like her to put in our SUVs before we all drive away.

There is a fork in the road miles from the Pack that leads in four different directions, and that is where we will all split up to see if we can get rid of him. We will keep in touch by phone, and hopefully you guys can get Umayza to the Academy without further problems,"" Armand says.

Conri tells him he will take care of the clothes they will need. He walks out of the living room, and after I have agreed on our meeting time, I disconnect the call. I stand in front of the window, staring at nothing in particular as Conri walks back into the room. He tells me that he put her clothes under her sheets.

""I left a set on a chair in her room for her to wear tomorrow, and the rest will be divided over the other SUVs. I really hope this will work—I would hate for that idiot to get his hands on her,"" Conri says. As my Lycan roars in my head, his Lycan roars out loud.

""I am going to give Armand her little red dress,"" he says with a smirk on his face, and I groan as the image of Umayza in that outfit pops into my head. My Lycan has a smirk on his face as he says, ""Something to picture when you have to take care of yourself."" I groan again as I quickly block him.",1,1764037722.0,BooksPoint,0,1.0,False

I wake up, but the day doesn’t start… it presses down on me like a weight I can’t lift. I look in the mirror. The reflection is mine, but it’s fractured. My eyes betray every sleepless night, every anxious heartbeat. My jaw tightens. My brain spins on a frequency no one else can hear.

I walk to the kitchen. Coffee. Not for pleasure, for survival. I overthink every movement: the cup too close, the spoon too loud. My mind races ahead, imagining every judgment, every silent critique from the world I’m about to face. I am hyper-aware of the self I present—clumsy, awkward, misunderstood.

I leave the apartment and step outside. The city hums, alive and indifferent. People brush past me, and I feel like a ghost in the crowd. A woman walks by, her laugh like a spotlight. I want connection, intimacy, a spark… but my anxiety suffocates me before I can breathe.

At work, I overcompensate. Every word, every glance, every action is calculated. I’m sharp, intelligent, perceptive… but misunderstood. My temper flares, my thoughts explode internally. People see a hint of arrogance or moodiness, but they don’t see the battlefield behind my eyes. They don’t know the war I fight just to exist.

I come home, exhausted. Alone. But even in solitude, I can’t rest. Thoughts spin: missed opportunities, unspoken words, failed connections. My brain hums, racing, analyzing. Yet, somewhere inside, a flame burns. A voice whispers: “You are not defeated. You are still here. You are still fighting.”

I write again: “They may not see me, but I see me. And that’s enough… for now.”

The fire is still there. Hidden, silent, invisible to all, but it grows.

He’s since broken up but he was quite heartbroken for the following year so I didn’t really get a chance to be close with him. 

I’ve told him I liked him before and he’s rejected me saying he’s not sure about me, I get the feeling it’s more about his ex than me. We’ve always been really close friends and talk to each other every day. Generally he’s quite closed off because of his past with his family, but he always lets me know if something is bothering him. He’s also always open about the fact he’s seeing people every now and then, though it’s not very serious. 

We flirt a lot when we’re together and we have before but I sense he feels more himself this year. He’s showing me music and movies he likes and we do our bedtime hygiene routine together. He’s initiated flirting more and quite openly like joking I want to touch his chest. I don’t catch him moving away as much when I get close. I notice when he sits down his leg is always touching mine and I can lean on him without him moving away. When he’s feeling goofy he’ll stick his face up to mine and stick his tongue out. Sometimes we touch our feet or hands together and it’s quite silly but we get a good laugh out of it. We game a lot and he’s usually really hard working but I’ve gotten him to want to stay later to play with me. 

The other night, we talked about work and he put his head on the pillow on my tummy as we’re linking arms. He always makes sure I’m okay especially when I’m drunk and bought me coffee in bed when I’m hungover.

I care about him a lot but I’m scared this is how he is with close friends. I don’t want to misinterpret him again and pull us apart.


PS We had gotten drunk and done some sexual things together before. I thought he went around in his own time but he told his friend recently he’s only ever done that with me.

I’d like advise on if I should wait because I don’t want to rush and push him away. I’m not in a rush as well myself, I just don’t want to give myself false hope.",5,1764037568.0,isfp,0,1.0,False

1p60l7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1p60l7k/councils_academy_the_lycan_brothers_gifted_mate/,Council's Academy: The Lycan Brothers Gifted Mate,"I only have thirty minutes left before I have to report to the kitchen for my duties. I glance at the tombstone one more time before I head back to the Pack-house, feeling sad as I always do after visiting my Mother's grave.

My Mom isn't buried there, but Dad placed the tombstone to give us both a place to go to. No one seems to know where her grave is, as she died miles away from here. Mom and Dad had been running from her parents, who didn’t agree with her accepting her fated Mate.

Dad barely escaped with me, and when we came to this Pack, I was only a year old. Dad took the position of Assassin, as it was his birthright.

We were happy until I turned fourteen, and he was told I had to move into the Pack-house, waiting to be chosen by unmated males. Every female over fourteen in this Pack had to follow this rule. If my Father had known, he would have never joined this Pack—he would’ve kept running with me.

In the almost three years since I had to move into the Pack-house, I have been working in the kitchen, something I will keep doing after my Mate selects me.

""Umayza, I need you to—"" Luna's voice trails off as she frantically searches the kitchen, not realizing I'm standing right behind her. I step forward and clear my throat.

Startled, she spins around. ""Where did you come from?""

""I've been at my station since my shift started, Luna,"" I reply, noticing she brought another young female to replace me in the kitchen.

This is the day I've been dreading for the past three years—the day I get fitted for the outfit I'll wear in six months, a day I fear even more. Nearly every female in our Pack dreads that day, except maybe the High-ranking ones.

Like me, every girl in the Pack gets fitted for an outfit when she turns seventeen, then has six months to learn a dance to perform in front of all the unmated males. On that night, any male can inform the Alpha if he wants you as his Mate.

High-ranking females perform for a much smaller audience, since there are fewer unmated High-ranking males left. In my case, I should be performing for the Highest ranks as well, but for some reason, our Alpha decided I'd have a better chance if I perform for the general unmated males instead.

Most of them are fine, but there are a few I wouldn't describe as okay—and with me, most females feel that way. I have tried to get out of this performance, but our Alpha wouldn't hear of it, and Dad pleading with him didn’t work either.

Dad doesn't like the way this Pack chooses their Mates, and Dad doesn't participate in the process. He told me that he is working on a plan to get out of here. He doesn't want me to have to go through this process, and according to Dad, it is even illegal.

Until Dad can find a way out of this, I will play along with their charade, and as an Assassin's Daughter, I have mastered looking innocent to perfection—not that I am innocent at all. I have seen enough since I was moved into the Pack-house, and if I ever get the chance, I will take the Alpha and this Pack down.

Our Luna is waiting for me to step into the room where this whole ordeal will start, and I look around at all the fabric and drawings in the room. One outfit is more revealing than the other, and I want to run as our Luna holds the drawing of my outfit in front of me.

""They designed this especially for you, Umayza. It will be in scarlet red, made from lace and silk,"" Luna explains as I take a closer look. It looks more like a nightgown, and I don't think it is suited for a girl my age.

That evening, I finally see Dad for the first time in three days, and I tell him I had my measurements taken for my outfit. ""It is knee-length with a flaring silk skirt and a lace top. The V-neck is almost down to my waist, and there are triangles of fabric behind the lace where my breasts will be. Two little buttons will fasten the lace on my back, and other than that, it is a bare back.""

Dad looks disgusted as I describe the dress to him.

He tells me he has a few more things to take care of before we can leave this Pack, but he will make sure it happens in the next few weeks. I tell him he has at least six months until we have to leave.

Weeks pass as I continue working in the kitchen, fitting my so-called dress, and rehearsing the dance.

Today, I have a sinking feeling that something bad is about to happen.

We have to eat in the dining room with the unmated males, and we always have to sit in the same seat. The only thing that changes is the males we sit between during a day.

As I place bowls of fruit on the tables, I realize my fears were right: I'm seated next to the cruelest male in the Pack.

Every female avoids him due to the rumors about his previous two Mates. It's said that he kept them locked up in his cottage, isolated them from their friends and the rest of the Pack.

Rumors also say that he is abusive, both physically and mentally, and that either he killed them or they took their own lives—stories vary with every person who tells them.

I've noticed him glancing at me from time to time, and today I have to sit right next to him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I hope he'll ignore me like most males do, but I'm afraid I won't be that lucky this time.

Our Alpha instructs us to take our seats, and I reluctantly sit down. As unmated males sit beside me, I keep my eyes on my plate. When the signal is given to start eating, I notice my nightmare placing a bowl of fruit in front of me. I quietly thank him as I take the bowl from his hands.

Neither male speaks to me during breakfast, and I feel relieved when I return to the kitchen. I spend my break in my room, reviewing everything Dad and I discussed over the past two weeks, before heading back to work.

Lunch is similar to breakfast, and as I make my way to the ballroom, I hear our Luna is already present. Over the years, I've learned to distinguish her laughter, and this one signals trouble for whoever is involved.

I stop beside the door, which they left ajar, unsure if they expect me yet, as I usually arrive ten minutes later.

""Does Umayza suspect this is a setup?"" one of the other females asks, and I want to scream, No.

""Of course not. She's as gullible as her Father was when he arrived here. They have no idea he requested the Alpha to put her in the other group, and he'll make sure she never finds out. He'll have his fun with her, but I hope she'll last longer than the others did.

His first Mate disappeared within a year, and his second Mate within two years. But you know, I don't care—he only picks females not born in this Pack,"" Luna responds. I quickly walk away until I am out of hearing range.

My heart races with a surge of dread and revulsion. To feign ignorance, I put on a light expression and start humming as I walk towards the ballroom again.

""Hello, Luna,"" I greet as I walk into the ballroom, only to stop dead in my tracks when I see my so-called dress ready.

""Umayza, today you will rehearse in your outfit,"" Luna says, holding the dress out to me. There's something in her eyes that tells me she's up to something.

Chapter 2 Conviction

Umayza

""Luna, I think there's been a mistake with my measurements. This is way too short,"" I protest after I change into my outfit.

The dress, now altered, barely covers my body. I can't help but worry that a simple turn will expose my panties to everyone.

""No, it's perfect for you,"" Luna says with a cold smile. ""I want to make sure that you find a Mate, and I don't want any of our High-ranking members to pick you. When someone requested you be placed in this group, I convinced my Mate it was for the best. I never wanted your Father or you to join our Pack.""

She states this, and I see there are at least five Warriors present—something that is normally not allowed during rehearsal.

I stare at our Luna as she starts laughing, and I finally realize she actually hates me, for whatever reason that might be.

Without thinking further, I lunge at her, my fist connecting with her nose in a sharp, resounding crack.

Two Warriors immediately seize me, pulling me away before I can do any more harm. One of the High-ranking females steps forward, her gaze icy. ""You've assaulted your Luna, and for that, you will be convicted."" She looks at everyone in the room, and they all agree with her.

The Luna has a smirk on her face as the Warriors drag me down to the dungeons.

An hour later, my Father arrives at the dungeon. There is no worry in his eyes as he says, ""Be patient. Everything will be alright.""

Whenever Dad says that, I know something unexpected is about to happen. It's something his Father taught him, and so far, it always turns out well.

I nod my head as I see my nightmare coming down the stairs.

His eyes move up and down my body, and the look he gives me sends shivers down my spine.

When Dad notices my discomfort, he turns around. ""Stay away from her,"" he growls at the man.

Dad pulls a chair in front of my cell and keeps his eyes on my nightmare. One of the Warriors standing guard grabs a sheet from a shelf and hands it to me through the bars.

I thank him as I wrap the sheet around myself.

We talk about everything that won’t give away that something is going to happen—the latest book I read, the show he watched on TV the other night. We talk about Mom and how much I resemble her. I have her light brown hair and chocolate brown eyes.

About an hour after dinner, our Alpha walks in with two huge males behind him, and I can tell they are Lycans.

Dad gives me a reassuring smile as I look at him. Apparently, this is my ticket out of here, and for some reason, our Alpha is not pleased.

Both males are about 6'3"" with blond hair and blue eyes. Anyone can see that they are twins, and if I had to bet on it, I would say they are High-ranking Lycans.

""Open her cell,"" one of the males says to a Warrior, and our Alpha just nods, though he looks like he wants to object.

""You are charged with assaulting your Luna. The Council has ordered us to bring you to the Academy,"" the same male tells me.

""You can leave the sheet in your cell,"" the other male says, and with some fright in my eyes, I look at Dad.

""Gentlemen, my Daughter was in a fitting session at the time of the attack. I brought her a change of clothes, as I know she won't be comfortable in what she's wearing under that sheet,"" Dad says.

I see both males looking from me to Dad, so I decide to show them what I am wearing.

I turn in such a way that only they can see what is underneath the sheet, and I see anger flashing through their eyes.

They order everyone out and tell Dad to hand me the bag with clothes he brought for me. Then, they all walk out of the dungeons.

Ten minutes later, one of the Lycans walks back in and tells me to follow him.

Dad is waiting outside with the other Lycan. He hugs me as he whispers in my ear that we will meet soon. I kiss him on his cheek before I follow one of the Lycans to a black SUV.

The young female who has been covering my station these past few weeks smiles at me, and I get a feeling that she called in my conviction to the Council. Within seconds, the other Lycan gets behind the wheel.

Just as he turns the ignition on, my nightmare jumps in front of the SUV.

Our Alpha quickly pulls him away, and they start arguing as the SUV passes them. I sigh in relief. I know both males heard it, but they don't say a word as we leave the Pack grounds behind us.

I close my eyes and lean back into the car seat, letting the events of the past day run through my mind.

I have a sinking feeling my nightmare won't give up easily, and I wonder if I should tell the men in the front seats about him.

As my thoughts race, sleep takes over.

Shouting startles me awake. I am very disoriented as I try to figure out what is going on.

""Damn it, Evander! Keep your eyes on the road. I'll see where they're coming from!"" the passenger yells. I glance to my left as I see him looking to the right.

""Left,"" I say, spotting a wolf emerging from the tree line. Evander swerves, barely avoiding the charging wolf.

I recognize the wolf instantly, and a cold certainty settles over me—this won't end until he's dead.

""I know this isn't the time to tell you my life story, but that wolf won't stop until he has me or he's dead,"" I say, my voice tight.

For a moment, the wolf seems to vanish, leaving a strange knot in my stomach. I scan the area, turning my head left and right, trying to spot him again. Up front, the men debate whether to take a detour to shake him off.

""Conri, call Council-member Boaz and ask what we should do about this wolf. Also, tell him he's after the convict we have in the SUV,"" Evander says, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. I keep scanning the surroundings, hoping the wolf doesn't show up again.

""Boaz wants us to head to one of the safe-houses. They'll hold a conference call to hear her story,"" Conri says after ending the call. ""They don't want to wait until she reaches the Academy. After that, they'll decide what to do about the wolf.""

Conri explains that the Council has safe-houses all over the country within the grounds of allied Packs. They plan to take me to the nearest one, where I'll get a chance to tell the Council what happened.

I continue scanning the area, but so far, my nightmare hasn't reappeared. I start to relax a little, though my Father's lessons keep me alert, even after we arrive at the Pack where we'll be staying for a few hours.

Evander drives past the Pack-house, quickly leaving the Pack village behind. He stops in front of a small cottage hidden among tall trees. I realize I would never have found this place on my own if Evander didn't know where to go.

Conri opens the door and extends a hand to help me out. At 5'7"", I feel pretty small standing next to him, and when Evander joins us, I get an irrational urge to run. But without my wolf, I know I wouldn't stand a chance.

It'll take another year before I get my wolf and can shift—maybe then I'll be able to outrun them.

I glance up at both of them and suddenly burst into laughter, realizing I'd never outrun them, even with my wolf.

They both look at me, confused.

""Sorry,"" I chuckle. ""I just realized that even with my wolf, there's no way I'd outrun the two of you.""

Thankfully, they have a sense of humor and laugh along with me.

Chapter 3 Evander

Evander

""Gentlemen, we just received a call from Bright Moon Pack. One of their members was accused and convicted of assaulting their Luna, and we need you to go pick her up. We weren't given many details, but the caller did mention that we needed to act quickly. She sounded pretty fearful, and she told us not to trust the Alpha and Luna about what happened—that we needed to hear her story as well,"" Council-member Boaz says.

Conri and I nod our heads as we get up from our seats, and we waste no time getting to our SUV.

""Evander, any thoughts as to why this person was asking the Council to react fast?"" Conri asks me, and I let the little information we have pass through my mind. It is not much, and I understand why Conri is asking me this question, considering the past.

My mind travels back to another assignment we did for the Council—a young woman had been accused and convicted by the Pack, and a Warrior had called the Council to inform them. When we arrived at the Pack, the Alpha had sworn up and down it had been a misunderstanding, and we contacted the Council on how to proceed.

We were told to head back to the Academy and leave the punishment up to the Alpha, as it had been a minor incident according to him. A month later, a neighboring Pack had contacted the Council that a female had asked for asylum—she was more dead than alive at that time.

When the Council was informed of the circumstances, they had realized it was the female we had been sent for, and Conri and I had been sent back to talk to her. During our conversation, we found out that if we had talked to her that day, we would have taken her with us.

To this day, we regret not talking to her, not saving her, and she made us promise with her dying breath that we would never walk away until we had heard both sides of the story. The Council allowed our Squad Captain Armand and the rest of our team to join us, and we were joined by Investigator Harlyn.

Together, we had managed to find the evidence against the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Turns out that the female had been the Alpha's Daughter, but he had never treated her as such, and his Beta and Gamma had taken liberties with her for years.

The Warrior who had called the Council had accused her on purpose—he had hoped to get her out of the situation she was in before it would end her life, and if we hadn't listened to the Alpha, he would have succeeded in rescuing her.

Conri pulls me from my thoughts as he asks again if I have any idea why the Council was asked to act quickly. ""We know it involves a female, and there are a number of reasons why a female would attack a Luna. Most of those reasons are enough to get convicted by the Council as well, so we can assume that it is not a standard reason,"" I say.

I let him think on my words as we drive towards Bright Moon Pack.

By the time we get there, we still haven't narrowed down the answer, and I am afraid we may never find out, as we will not be there when she has to face the Council. Maybe we will get the chance to ask her on the way back.

The Alpha is not too pleased with our presence—he actually looks really uncomfortable—and as we follow him to the dungeons, I hear Conri through our mind-link: ""I think the caller was right; it is a good thing we came this soon."" I believe he is correct in his assumption.

The girl in the cell is gorgeous, and I can see that the male with her is related to her. I see an uncomfortable look on her face after I tell her to leave the sheet behind. Once she realizes we don't understand her concerns, she turns her back on the others and reveals what she is wearing. I quickly understand her discomfort, and I order everyone out as I tell her to get changed.

The girl is wearing a dress that barely covers her, and the top is mostly see-through. I groan inwardly as I take in how she looks. ""Fuck, Evander. What the hell is she wearing? There is no way I will let her walk out of here dressed like that,"" Conri says.

As we are waiting outside, the Alpha orders the Warriors to follow him to the Pack-house. Her Father looks around before he turns to us and hands me a piece of paper. ""Give this to my Daughter once she is safe and the Council gives you permission,"" he says. I peek inside to see a number written down.

I nod my head before I push it into my pocket. Conri walks back into the dungeons after ten minutes to take the girl to our SUV, and I see Pack-members gathering as Conri guides her over to the SUV.

One member looks murderous, while another has a small smile on her face, and I think I just found out who the girl's guardian angel is. But I don't understand why the male looks as if we took his Mate away from him. Unless, of course, she is his underaged Mate—that would explain his expression.

But if she is his Mate, then why didn't he say anything? Or why was he not with her in the dungeon? I only have more questions than answers, and I need to talk to Conri about this. I also need to inform the Council about my thoughts, and I hope they will be able to help her.

The Alpha pulls the idiot out of the way so I can drive off with the girl in the backseat, and as I look in the rearview mirror, she closes her eyes. Within minutes, she is fast asleep. It gives me the chance to tell Conri my thoughts, and he quickly relays everything to the Council through an email.

""What do you think that piece of fabric was about?"" Conri asks me, and I think back on the minuscule, red dress she had been wearing, cursing at Conri for putting that picture back in my head. I thought she had been gorgeous with that sheet wrapped around her, but seeing her in that dress...

I shake my head as if I can get rid of the image that way, and from the corner of my eye, I see that Conri isn't doing much better. The sight of her in that dress affects both of us. We both softly chuckle as we adjust ourselves, and I keep an eye on our passenger.

A movement on the right side of the SUV pulls my attention away from her, and Conri is on high alert as he looks out the window, but there is nothing to see out there. I curse as something flies over the hood of the SUV, and Conri follows whatever it was into the forest.

A moment later, I curse loudly as I pull the steering wheel hard to the left—a wolf jumps out of the way in the nick of time, and a moment later, the wolf is back again. ""A rogue on a suicide mission,"" Conri mumbles as we swerve across the road, trying to avoid the wolf.

Conri is shouting at me to keep my eyes on the road, but he can't watch both sides of the SUV at the same time, and I don't want to ram this SUV into a wolf. ""Left,"" I hear from the backseat, and I manage to avoid him once again, but her next words freeze the blood in my veins.

""He won't give up until he has me or until he is dead."" 

Chapter 4 Conri

Evander

It is a whisper, but it is a very clear whisper, and Conri calls Council-member Boaz at my request. We need to know what we can and can't do when it comes to this idiotic wolf, and we need to keep this girl safe at all costs.

Council-member Boaz orders us to go to the nearest safe-house, and I sigh in relief the moment I start to recognize my surroundings. It won't be long before we are at the cottage. I am glad we have been here before, because now no one knows who we brought with us.

It is a one-story cottage surrounded by tall trees and a whole variety of wildflowers. There are two bedrooms at the back, and that is more than enough to accommodate us tonight. As Conri stands next to her, I realize that she isn't tall, and we both tower over her.

She hasn't lost her sense of humor as she tells us what ran through her mind, and I chuckle as I try to imagine her running away from us. My Lycan starts to chuckle at that image. Conri guides her into the cottage as I grab the bag from the SUV—her Father gave it to me after Conri left us to get her from the dungeon.

My Lycan has been acting strange for the past two days, and he is starting to annoy the hell out of me. Conri told me that his Lycan was no better. Neither of our Lycans are able to tell us why they act the way they do, nor can they explain what it is they are feeling.

Tomorrow will be the first day of the Full Moon, and I have a suspicion our Lycans are hoping to find their Mate. We have been waiting long enough for her. We have been waiting for her for thirty years, and Conri and I are close to giving up hope.

With every year that passes, my Lycan starts to get more depressed, but every time I bring up taking a chosen Mate, he blows up in my face, and it takes days before he talks to me again. Conri's Lycan is the same when it comes to our fated Mate and a chosen Mate.

We sometimes talk about it and have a good laugh at their attitude towards a chosen Mate. Conri's Lycan refused to talk to him for a week when Conri once suggested to me that we each take our own chosen Mate—not that he was being serious.

Rummaging in the kitchen pulls me from my thoughts, and I see Conri in the doorway with his arms crossed in front of his chest.

Conri

After I ask my Brother why he thinks she got convicted, I know where his thoughts are going—the same place and time as mine—and I know why the Council chose us to go get this girl. Not that they don’t trust anyone else to do the job, but because of our past experiences.

The Alpha is waiting for us as we stop in front of the Pack-house, and I can tell by the look on his face he is not pleased to see us—not that Evander or I care about that at all. ""Alpha, we received a call that one of your Pack-members attacked your Luna. We are here to bring her in front of the Council,"" I say.

Before the Alpha gets a chance to say anything, his Luna steps forward. ""She hit me in the face and broke my nose,"" she growls angrily, and the Alpha has no choice but to show us where they are holding the girl. On our way to the dungeons, the Alpha tries to convince us that his Luna was overreacting to Umayza’s attack.

""Alpha, Umayza attacked your Luna and broke her nose. There were witnesses to it, and they convicted her of assault. We will take her to the Council for her sentencing,"" I say—not that the Council will sentence anyone without hearing the full story.

Over the years, I have seen males and females brought in front of the Council, and some of them were actually sentenced for their crimes. But most of them had been relocated or given the chance to get revenge for a wrongful conviction. Not that Packs were informed of what happened to the Pack-members we brought in front of the Council.

Squad-members who are sent to get a convicted member from a Pack usually don’t even find out what they were accused of or what their explanation for their crime was. Sometimes we get to hear the story as we bring them to a new Pack, or we escort them towards the Sanctuary.

We walk down the stairs into the dungeons, through a hallway leading us further into the dungeons, and the Alpha opens a door that leads into a small room with one cell. My eyes get drawn to the female inside the cell—her hair in a messy bun on top of her head, and her chocolate brown eyes don’t reveal anything.

My Lycan growls in my head as she shows us what she is wearing under that sheet. I link Evander to tell him I won’t allow her to walk out of there dressed like that. He orders everyone out of the dungeons to give her time to change into something more comfortable for her.

My mind is on Umayza, and I know her appearance affected Evander as much as it did me when I see him adjusting himself after I had asked what that piece of fabric was about. I had quickly shoved it into her bag when her back was turned to me—I wanted the Council to see what it was she had been wearing at the time.

My Lycan is convinced it has something to do with the attack, and I have to agree with him on that. It was a little too revealing for my taste. I think as long as she was standing still there wouldn’t be a problem, but if she moved, it would have revealed more than any male should be able to see.

From the corner of my eye, I see movement, and my yelling at Evander wakes Umayza up. Her eyes are on the left side of the road as I watch the right side of the road. Once I am certain the wolf is gone, I call Council-member Boaz with the information I have, and once he gives the okay, we head for the nearest safe-house.

Despite the situation, she hasn’t lost her sense of humor, and my Lycan shows me an image of us chasing after her. I guide her into the cottage and show her where her room is, but she is more interested in the kitchen. There are fresh fruits and vegetables in the fridge, and I can smell that the Alpha has recently been here.

Looks like the Council warned him we were on our way, and I am glad he put some provisions into the fridge and cupboards before we got here. Umayza seems at ease as she is putting everything she wants on the counter. I watch her as Evander walks into the cottage, and for a moment, he stops to look at what is going on in the kitchen.

He smiles as he walks towards the back of the house with her bag. ""You might want to get the dress out of there—I took it as evidence for the Council,"" I say through the mind-link, and he growls back at me. I chuckle at him, knowing exactly why he growled at me.

Chapter 5 Safe-house

Conri

I hear water running in the shower, and I wait for Evander to get back to the kitchen before I head for the shower myself. Once I am back, Evander asks her if she wants to eat first or if she wants to shower first. ""Food first,"" she says as she places three plates on the kitchen island and takes the seat across from me.

Evander sits down next to me, and we are enjoying the food she has prepared for us. She asks us if anyone knows that we are here, and Evander tells her that the Alpha does, but that he won’t be coming here, as that is the deal the Council made with him.

""None of the Packs come to the safe-house when it is occupied. The Council doesn’t want them to know who is here, and it is for their own protection. If your Alpha was to call here, no one will be able to tell him if you are here or not,"" I explain, and she tells me that that makes sense to her.

Evander and I tell her to take a shower while we clean up the kitchen. At first, she wants to object, but one look at us and she thanks us before she walks to the back of the house. It doesn’t take us long to clean everything up, and I start making coffee for Evander and myself.

I hear her sniffle the air as she walks towards us, and I ask her if she would like some coffee as well. ""Yeah, might keep me awake long enough to answer the questions from the Council,"" she says, and Evander and I chuckle as we know a meeting can be boring at times.

Evander tells her that normally we don’t hear about the charges or why someone committed the alleged crimes—that we hardly ever hear about what triggered them to do what they did—and that in some cases, we are more than curious to find out.

""Well, looks like today is your lucky day, as you will be here when I have to talk to the Council,"" she says, but she doesn’t sound as if it bothers her that we will be hearing everything as well.

Umayza

It is nine in the evening when Evander sets up a laptop for the conference call with the Council. Unlike I had expected, I feel comfortable with the two males next to me, and I know that they will keep me safe while I am with them. Instead of multiple screens popping up for the conference call, there is only one, and I can see the seven Council-members.

Conri introduces the Council-members to me, and Council-member Dayanah tells me that she will be leading the questioning for this investigation. She asks if I want Conri and Evander to leave the cottage. ""That won’t be necessary—they have seen a part of what I need to tell the Council,"" I answer.

Conri sits down to my left as Evander sits down to my right, and for some reason, I feel completely at ease. I don’t feel the anxiety I would feel as I had during one of the meals back in my Pack. I take a deep breath to calm my nerves, and I decide to start my story with how we came to live in Bright Moon Pack.

""My parents were fated Mates, but my maternal Grandparents didn’t approve of my Father, and my parents left Mom’s Pack to be together. However, they were hunted down by my Grandparents, and by the time they finally caught up with my parents, I had already been born. Not that it stopped them from hunting us down—they didn’t even stop after Mom died while protecting me.

Dad kept running until we reached Bright Moon Pack, and Dad was offered the position of Assassin, as that is his rank. Dad was able to build a normal life for us there. It wasn’t until I turned fourteen that we found out this Pack has a rather strange look on Mates—our Alpha doesn’t allow anyone to accept their fated Mate, and anyone that finds their fated Mate is ordered to reject them.

Every female starts living in the Pack-house at the age of fourteen—no exceptions. The unmated females have to stay inside the Pack-house. We were not allowed to go to our family’s homes, and they were allowed a minimum of contact with us at the Pack-house.""

I feel the males next to me get angrier the more I say, and even the Council-members look angry.

""We have to do all the chores in the Pack-house. We prepare the meals for everyone, and when we have our meals, our stations get covered by mated females. During the meals, we sit in assigned seats, and each day, different unmated males sit on either side of us.

When a female turns seventeen, our Luna takes her to a part of the Pack-house we call the fitting room. Your measurements get taken while our Luna picks out a drawing of your outfit, and from that day on, the female has to attend dance classes.

They teach the female a very sensual dance, which you have to perform in front of all the unmated males six months before you turn eighteen. If a male wants to have you as his chosen Mate, he informs our Alpha. There is a ceremony for the High-ranking males and one for the Warriors.

With my Father being our Pack’s Assassin, I normally would have to perform in front of the High-ranking males. But the Wolf that attacked us asked our Alpha to put me in front of the Warriors, as he has an interest in me. I am not sure if our Alpha wanted to grant his request, but on the day I attacked our Luna, she told me she had convinced her Mate to allow it.

She told me she never wanted my Father or me to join the Pack, and this was her way of getting revenge. They also altered my dress to be a lot shorter than it initially was, and when I asked her about it, she told me how she had helped my nightmare to get me in front of him.""

I didn’t look at anyone as I spoke, and my eyes are still on the floor once I am finished.

""Umayza, you had every right to attack her, and we won’t sentence you for this crime. I will send a team to investigate this Pack, because I want to know why the Luna didn’t want you and your Father in her Pack, and we will put a stop to their way of running their Pack.

Is there any way you can contact your Father?"" Council-member Dayanah asks, and I shake my head as I didn’t have my phone with me.

""Council-member Dayanah, her Father handed me a piece of paper with a phone number on it before we left. He asked me to give it to her once she was safe, and if you would allow me to give it to her,"" Evander says.

Council-member Dayanah tells him to give it to me. I smile as I open the piece of paper and recognize my Father’s handwriting.

Chapter 6 Mate

Evander

That my Lycan and I were fuming was putting it mildly, and I could feel through our bond that my Brother wasn’t doing any better. The Council is quick in telling Umayza she will not be sentenced for attacking her Luna, and she releases a sigh of relief.

I don’t understand why some Lycans or Werewolves can be this depraved. The leaders of Bright Moon Pack are really a fry short of a happy meal, and I want to knock some sense into them. Knowing there will be an investigation makes me feel a little better, but not by much.

Council-member Dayanah asks Umayza what she wants to do, and Umayza tells the Council she wants to train to be an Assassin just like her Father—to help the Council get justice for those who can’t get it themselves.

""Umayza, the Council grants you your request. Please call your Father and ask him to report to the Academy as soon as he can. We can use someone with his experience here,"" Council-member Dayanah says. Soon after that, we say our goodbyes to the Council-members.

Umayza looks exhausted, and Conri asks her if she wants to call her Father tonight or tomorrow when we are on our way to the Academy. She opts for the next day as she is struggling to keep her eyes open. Conri guides her to her bedroom as I get some sodas for Conri and myself.

I am proud of Umayza for telling her story to the Council. I can only imagine what it was like growing up in a Pack like that, and I am glad Conri and I grew up in a Pack that values its members. Before I can let my mind wander to White Crescent Pack, Conri walks back into the room.

""She was asleep before she hit the pillow,"" he says with a smile on his face. ""I am glad we grew up in White Crescent Pack. Alpha Atlas was a good and fair Alpha, and Luna Anthea was so sweet. I know Amarah has some big shoes to fill, but I know she will be an excellent Alpha.""

Before I can reply, Conri’s phone starts ringing. When he sees the caller-ID, he puts it on speaker. ""Captain, to what do we owe this pleasure?"" Conri asks, and Captain Armand tells us he and the rest of our Squad will meet us outside the Pack’s territory.

""Knowing a male is after Umayza made Council-member Boaz contact me to come up with a plan to get her safely to the Academy, and Theron has come up with a solid plan. We need clothes that smell like her to put in our SUVs before we all drive away.

There is a fork in the road miles from the Pack that leads in four different directions, and that is where we will all split up to see if we can get rid of him. We will keep in touch by phone, and hopefully you guys can get Umayza to the Academy without further problems,"" Armand says.

Conri tells him he will take care of the clothes they will need. He walks out of the living room, and after I have agreed on our meeting time, I disconnect the call. I stand in front of the window, staring at nothing in particular as Conri walks back into the room. He tells me that he put her clothes under her sheets.

""I left a set on a chair in her room for her to wear tomorrow, and the rest will be divided over the other SUVs. I really hope this will work—I would hate for that idiot to get his hands on her,"" Conri says. As my Lycan roars in my head, his Lycan roars out loud.

""I am going to give Armand her little red dress,"" he says with a smirk on his face, and I groan as the image of Umayza in that outfit pops into my head. My Lycan has a smirk on his face as he says, ""Something to picture when you have to take care of yourself."" I groan again as I quickly block him.

1p60kij,https://www.reddit.com/r/acidreflux/comments/1p60kij/new_member_here_need_help/,New Member Here - Need help :(,"Hi everyone,

Recently I have been suffering from what seems like Acid reflux and it has now been 12 days of this.

let me break it down for everyone.



**November 12th evening:**   
ate Thai food at night with my wife, no issues.

**November 13th morning:**  
Ate the Thai food for leftovers with wedges on the side then had a coffee an hour later.  
That afternoon I experienced what felt like Nausea and I wanted to throw up.  
The feeling eventually went away after a few hours.

**Friday and Saturday after:**  
Can't remember what I ate but I know I ate somewhat light and didn't feel much symptoms.

**Sunday November 16th:**  
Started the morning with an apple and a matcha latte.  
an hour later - Symptoms arrived again.  
Later that afternoon, I thought eating would help so I had KFC.  
I then threw up the food and felt nauseous again - the feeling went away after a few hours.

All last week, I ate considerably lighter and avoided coffee most of the time. Symptoms were less but still came and went depending on what I ate.

**Friday November 21st.**  
went out in the evening and ate Pho and spring roles and a double scoop of ice cream at 10pm at night. I figured the symptoms would arrive, but they did not? Weird, now I am confused.

**Saturday morning of the 22nd.**  
Still no symptoms after eating late and bad at night? Weird, am I cured?  
Had a little McDonalds - no symptoms.

**Sunday the 23rd ( Yesterday )**  
I put it to the test, had French fries from Burger King - still no symptoms.  
Had chicken soulvaki with garlic sauce and hummus - still no symptoms?

  
at this point, I assume I am cured.

  
**NOW TODAY:**  
I feel as though I am cured so I :

woke up and had oatmeal : no symptoms.  
made a ham and cheese sandwich : no symptoms.

Had a cold brew coffee and small bag of chips : Boom, symptoms returned.

I thought I thought I should eat so I ate :

Rice, Fried chicken cutlet, broccoli in soy sauce.

and NOW my symptoms of feeling nauseated are fully back, I feel like I need to bard and I keep burping.

WHAT IS THIS? HOW DID I EAT ALL THAT FOOD ON FRIDAY, SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AND BARELY FELT ANYTHING? THEN TODAY I HAVE A COFFEE AND A HEAVY DINNER AND BOOM IT'S BACK?

  
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP :(

  
ps : I went to the doctor last week, took blood work and it was all good. He thinks it's acid reflux and digestion. But coffee never bothered me before? why now? why all of a sudden?

  
Thanks everyone.",1,1764037191.0,acidreflux,0,1.0,False
1p60jyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1p60jyk/where_to_buy_a_laptop_stand_for_small_apartment/,Where to buy a laptop stand for small apartment setups?,"If you're working from a small apartment, you know how tough it can be to set up a proper workspace. Every inch counts, and your desk space is probably fighting for room with your coffee mug, notebooks, and maybe yesterday's lunch plate. A laptop stand can seriously change the game for you.

## Why You Need a Laptop Stand in a Small Space

When you're cramped for space, a laptop stand helps you work vertically instead of horizontally. You get better airflow under your laptop, which means it won't overheat during those long work sessions. Plus, raising your screen to eye level saves your neck from that painful hunched-over position.

The right stand also creates extra storage underneath. You can slide your keyboard, mouse, or papers under it when you're done working. In a small apartment, furniture that does double duty is worth its weight in gold.

## What Makes a Good Laptop Stand for Apartments

Look for something adjustable so you can find the perfect height for your setup. Portability matters too – you might want to move between your desk, couch, or even bed. Lightweight aluminum or plastic stands work great because they're sturdy without taking up too much visual space.

Foldable designs are perfect when you need to clear your table for dinner or when friends come over. Some stands also have built-in cable management, which keeps your small space looking neat instead of like a tech store exploded.

## Where to Actually Buy One

You don't need to drive around to five different stores. Amazon has tons of options with detailed reviews from real people who actually use them in their homes. You can compare different styles, sizes, and price ranges all in one place.

Check out [this collection of laptop stands](https://athomewave.com/laptop-stand) to see what's available. The selection includes everything from basic risers to fancy adjustable models with cooling fans. Reading through customer photos helps too – you'll see how the stands look in actual apartments, not just professional photos.

## Quick Shopping Tips

Filter by price if you're on a budget. Most decent stands run between $20-$50, which is pretty reasonable for something you'll use every day. Pay attention to weight capacity if you have a chunky gaming laptop versus a light MacBook Air.

Look at the dimensions carefully. Measure your desk space before ordering so you don't end up with something that hangs off the edge. Customer questions and answers are goldmine information – other people probably asked the exact questions you're wondering about.

## Making Your Decision

Once you've narrowed down your options, check the return policy. Most stands are returnable if they don't fit your space right, which takes the pressure off choosing perfectly the first time.

Ready to upgrade your workspace? Head over to [browse laptop stands](https://athomewave.com/laptop-stand) and find one that fits your apartment setup. Your neck and your productivity will thank you, and your small space will feel a lot more organized.

Getting your workspace sorted doesn't have to be complicated. With the right laptop stand, even the tiniest apartment desk can become a comfortable, functional spot where you actually want to work.",1,1764037149.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

# **THE RED CASTLE – Episode Two**

### **“The Stokes Shift”**

The Institute for Advanced Study woke to a peculiar kind of quiet — the kind that meant something was happening behind several closed doors at once. Even the deer on the lawn seemed to be holding their breath.

**INT. IAS – FULD HALL – MORNING**

Dr. **Rhea Laghari** — still the newest and somehow already the most rumored-about fellow on campus — arrived with coffee, a notebook, and a sense that today something was going to try to recruit her, seduce her, or explode in front of her. Possibly all three.

At the front desk, **Martin**, the unflappable administrator, nodded with urgent dread.

**MARTIN**
They’re early today.

**RHEA**
“They”?

**MARTIN**
The Smithsonian delegation. They brought a PowerPoint this time. That’s never good.

He slid her a color-coded map of Fuld Hall as if it were a military operation. Several rooms were circled in red.

**MARTIN**
If you hear the term “synergy hub,” run.

Rhea sighed. Second week at the IAS and the inter-institutional poaching already felt like a Cold War.

---

### **INT. SEMINAR ROOM B – MOMENTS LATER**

Inside, **Professor Mendel**, IAS veteran and habitual coat-misplacer, attempted to explain quantum geometry to a nervous cluster of postdocs. Halfway through a sentence, his phone buzzed violently.

He checked the caller ID.

He groaned.

**MENDEL**
Smithsonian again. They’ve discovered I dislike D.C. traffic and they keep using it as leverage.

He answered with all the enthusiasm of a man attending his own arraignment.

**MENDEL**
(into phone)
No, I don’t want a parking stipend. No, not even a *big* parking stipend. Listen — my work requires isolation from society, not a front-row view of the Capitol. Yes, I’m sure.
(long beat)
*No*, I don’t need a personal gopher. Why would anyone need a personal gopher?

The postdocs immediately began whispering: *They’re offering gophers now?*

---

### **EXT. IAS GROUNDS – MIDDAY**

Meanwhile, on the lawn near the pond, an argument was brewing.

The Smithsonian envoy — the impeccably dressed **Dr. Naomi Klyne**, who carried herself like a diplomat who moonlighted as a shark — walked briskly toward Rhea.

**KLYNE**
Dr. Laghari. Wonderful to see you in natural light. I’d love a minute.

**RHEA**
I’m on my way to lunch.

**KLYNE**
Perfect. I’ll walk with you.

Rhea tried increasing her pace. Klyne matched it effortlessly.

**KLYNE**
We’ve been watching your turbulence–frequency paper. Daring methodology. Slightly irresponsible. But daring.

**RHEA**
Thank you? I think?

**KLYNE**
We’d like to offer you… options. Resources. A research team instead of a research *room*. A lab that doesn’t smell faintly of Einstein’s old pipe.

Rhea stumbled.

**RHEA**
You smelled *that*?

**KLYNE**
Everyone smells that. The entire building smells like theoretical tobacco.

Klyne handed her a sleek envelope.

**KLYNE**
Just look it over. Not now. Not here. Preferably not where the IAS loyalty sensors can read your heartbeat.

She walked away with the confidence of someone who always had a backup plan hidden inside another backup plan.

---

### **INT. IAS – CAFETERIA – AFTERNOON**

The Institute cafeteria — a quiet room where Nobel laureates casually spilled soup — hummed with gossip.

At one table: Rhea and her three unofficial IAS guides:

* **Professor Mendel**
* **Helena Voss**, the coldly brilliant mathematician who considered smiling an unnecessary biological function
* **Tomás Arriaga**, astrophysicist, rumored escapee of at least two Smithsonian recruitment dinners

Tomás leaned over conspiratorially.

**TOMÁS**
Let me guess — they offered you the envelope.

Rhea set it on the table.

**RHEA**
What’s inside it?

**HELENA**
(ice cold)
A trap.

**MENDEL**
Or an offer you’ll pretend not to consider for two weeks before seriously considering it.

**TOMÁS**
Or a parking stipend. They love those.

Rhea didn’t open the envelope.

Yet.

---

### **INT. SMITHSONIAN OPS ROOM – WASHINGTON D.C. – SAME TIME**

Back in D.C., the Smithsonian’s internal “Talent Acquisition War Room” buzzed with screens, maps, and a whiteboard titled “OPERATION: RED CASTLE SHIFT.”

A young analyst pointed at a blinking signal on the Princeton grid.

**ANALYST**
We’ve made contact with Laghari. Klyne initiated Phase Two.

**DIRECTOR HALE**, a man who believed academic recruitment should involve tactics once classified by NATO, steepled his hands.

**HALE**
Good. Maintain light pressure. Nothing overt. No drones this time.

Another analyst timidly raised a hand.

**ANALYST 2**
…Do we tell her about the stipend?

**HALE**
No. Not yet. Stipends are for the endgame.

---

### **INT. IAS – FULD HALL – EVENING**

Rhea returned to her office, the envelope still unopened.

She stared at the chalkboard filled with equations. The IAS quiet had grown warm to her — the kind of quiet that made thought easier, not lonelier.

She finally opened the envelope.

Inside: a single white card.

A date, a time.
A location in D.C.
A line of text.

**“We only recruit those whose work might change something.”**

Underneath it, handwritten:

**“Come see what we think you’re capable of.”**

She dropped the card on the desk.

**RHEA**
(to herself)
Goddammit.

She already felt the pull.
But also — the resistance.

---

### **EXT. IAS CAMPUS – NIGHT**

Tomás caught up to her as she walked home through the quiet.

**TOMÁS**
You look like someone who’s been offered either a golden opportunity or a very sophisticated bear trap.

**RHEA**
Maybe both.

He walked beside her.

**TOMÁS**
Listen, the Smithsonian has flash. Resources. Buildings that don’t creak at night like something’s thinking in the walls.
But the IAS gives you one thing they never will.

**RHEA**
What’s that?

**TOMÁS**
Space.
Real, silent, terrifying space.
The kind where ideas actually form before someone monetizes them.

They reached the campus gate.

Rhea paused.

**RHEA**
If I go to that meeting… am I betraying the Institute?

Tomás shrugged.

**TOMÁS**
Only if you don’t come back.

**hdfidelity presents**  

# *The Langley Directive*  

---  

# **Episode 4 — “Budget Season”**

The first sign of Budget Season was the coffee.  
More specifically: the sudden disappearance of it.

Every year, like migrating birds or cicadas, the Office of Appropriations consumed more caffeine than the rest of Langley combined. Supplies vanished. Machines clogged. Someone inevitably blamed foreign sabotage. But everyone knew the truth:

**Congress was coming.**

---

## **I. THE ANNUAL SACRIFICE**

On the seventh floor, a grim ritual unfolded.

Deputy Director **Conrad Vale** stood before a projector screen displaying a pie chart so aggressively color-coded it caused actual discomfort.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began solemnly, “it is once again time to justify our existence.”

A low groan rippled through the room.

He tapped the remote. Up came a slide labeled:

> **PROPOSED FY BUDGET REALLOCATION**
>
> * 14% Cyber Resilience  
> * 9% Public Transparency Initiatives  
> * 32% Discretionary Black Programs (Classified)  
> * 45% Classified (Classified)

Someone raised a hand. “Deputy Director, what exactly is *‘Classified (Classified)’*?”

Vale smiled. “If I knew, I’d sleep better.”

A few chuckles escaped. Mostly pitying ones.

---

## **II. ENTER: THE HILL**

Meanwhile, Director **Leonard Graves** was preparing in his own way.

He sat in his office, rolling a cigarette, reading the committee briefing packet with an expression one might use while inspecting a suspicious stain.

“Three hours of questions from people who don’t know what we do,” he murmured.  
“But enjoy pretending they do.”

Denise stood in the doorway with a garment bag.

“I pressed your suit, Director.”

He nodded. “Good. I want to look respectable when they misunderstand me.”

She paused. “Should I pack your flask?”

Graves considered this.

“…Yes. But discreetly.”

---

## **III. THE HEARING PREP**

The team assembled in the main conference room to rehearse responses.

Avery Lott, now transferring between Cyber Ethics and “General Analyst When Needed,” was tasked with roleplaying *the most antagonistic possible senator.*
His first attempt:

> “Director Graves, why did the Agency spend $8 million on something labeled *‘Project Night Window’*? What is that? Why is it so dark? Why a window?”

Vale clapped. “Good energy, Avery. Lean into the paranoia.”

Nadia Quinn, repurposed as “communications wrangler,” recorded everything for later messaging.

During a simulated grilling, she flipped through her notes and said:

“Director, remember to say ‘interagency cooperation’ at least twice. Preferably while looking bored.”

Graves frowned. “I *am* bored.”

“Perfect,” she replied.

---

## **IV. THE COMMITTEE HEARING**

Room 211 of the Hart Senate Office Building smelled of polished wood and cheap indignation.

News cameras lined the walls. Staffers scuttled. Senators adjusted microphones like they were auditioning for a morning talk show.

Graves took his seat. Vale sat to his right, buzzing like a very expensive anxiety device. Nadia, Avery, and Denise sat behind them as the “support bench,” also known as *the blame sponge section.*

The Committee Chair opened with theatrical gravitas:

“Director Graves, thank you for joining us to discuss this year’s budget request.  
We have concerns.”

Graves nodded politely. “So do I.”

This was not the expected answer.

---

### **The Dance Begins**

For two hours, they fired questions:

* Overspending.  
* Underspending.  
* Duplicate spending.  
* Spending on programs nobody could confirm existed.  
* Spending on programs that, if they did exist, they definitely shouldn’t mention.

Vale responded like a man afraid someone would see through his suit and discover a stack of performance reviews stapled to bone.

Graves responded like a man who’d lost interest in survival.

At one point, a senator questioned the breach from Episode 3.

> **SENATOR:** “Director, regarding the so-called ‘intrusion simulation’—was it, in fact, a simulation?”  
> **GRAVES:** “Senator, in intelligence work, reality is often classified.”  
> **SENATOR:** “…What does that mean?”  
> **GRAVES:** “Exactly.”

A reporter choked on laughter. Nadia wrote that line down immediately.

---

## **V. THE INCIDENT**

Halfway through the hearing, the room lights flickered.
Then dimmed.  
Then went out entirely.

Chaos.

Cameras flashed. Staffers yelled. Vale made a noise only dogs could hear.

In the darkness, Graves calmly took a sip from his flask.

When emergency lights flickered back, the Committee Chair stared accusingly.

“Director Graves—was your Agency responsible for this power outage?”

Graves blinked.  
“Madam Chair, we lack the budget for such theatrics. Pending your approval, of course.”

A few senators laughed. One staffer fainted.

---

## **VI. AFTERMATH**

Back at Langley, the debrief was held in a dimly lit room because the power grid was still “recovering.”

Vale paced. “The outage made us look incompetent.”

Graves shrugged. “We are incompetent. We’ve just trained ourselves to lean into it.”

Avery coughed softly. “Um… the outage wasn’t us. I checked the logs. It was a nearby construction crew. They hit a line.”

Vale stopped. “So it *wasn’t* sabotage?”

“No,” Avery said. “Just poor infrastructure.”

Nadia sighed. “Honesty really is the scariest explanation in this building.”

Denise updated her logbook:

> **Incident #48: Power Failure During Hearing.**  
> Cause: *Actual electricians.*  
> Spin: *Possible cyber-intimidation.*  
> Outcome: Director unusually charming.

She added a heart.

---

## **VII. EPILOGUE**

A week later, an envelope arrived:

> **APPROVED: FY BUDGET (FULL).**  
> *Plus a discretionary bonus earmarked for “classified utility upgrades.”*

Vale held it like a sacred text.  
Graves held it like a bill.  
Nadia framed her favorite headline:

> **CIA Budget Increases After Unrelated Blackout**  
> *Experts Unsure If Strategic or Stupid.*

No one corrected them.

Because at Langley, stupidity and strategy often shared a parking spot.

---

**Fade out.**
**Title Card Italics:** *BUDGET SECURED. TRUTH NOT INCLUDED.*

So my exwife had a good friend who we will refer to as 'H'. Now H did not have the best history with dating. She's a bigger girl but cute, super friendly, intelligent, comes from a great family, etc but her luck with guys was so bad. When I first met her through my than wife, she was single but shortly after started dating someone from their friend circle (new to H but my than wife knew this guy 'C' for along time). 
They dated for years (which we were surprised by because we all thought C was gay). 1 month before their wedding, he broke it off with H and told her the truth. He really did love her but couldn't live the lie anymore and was gay (also had been sleeping with men for the past month or so).
She was obviously heartbroken but understood why he broke it off. Following that she dated some real ""winners"", including your stereotypical redneck guy with 2 brain cells and teeth that could chew an apple through a chain link fence.
But it was when she started dating 'Chris' when it all changed.
I remember meeting him when we all hangout, seemed like a nice guy.

We hangout several times with them over the course of coming months and Chris moved in with H (which we thought was rather quick).
Fast forward 2 months and we host a huge party. Lots of friends and couples attend, including H & Chris.
During the evening one of my closest and best friends pulls me aside and asks about Chris, ""what's his story?"". I asked what he meant and he clarified that he was getting a very strange and fake vibe from him and how well I knew him to which I said I had only hangout with him briefly a handful of times. The party concluded and Chris & H spent the night in our spare room.

1 week later, my than wife informs me one night while watching shows that H leased Chris a car, bought him a new Playstation as well as some new chains (jewelry). I said wow shes really spoiling him huh (H had a very good job but not enough to spend lavishly like that & Chris said he worked in insurance and traveled for work). 

1 week after that, I am at a garage having maintenance done to my vehicle and I get a phone call from my than wife. I can tell she's amped up from the way she says hi and I ask what's going on. She asks if I have a newspaper nearby, I looked around and spot one sitting on the coffee table of the waiting room I'm sitting in. I tell her yeah I got one, she tells me to flip to page whatever and look halfway down that page. So I do and when I read the story headline and glaze over the story text I couldn't believe it. I said ""Oh My God, are you serious?"" She said oh yeah, H had called her to warn her about it incase she happened to read about it in the paper PLUS told her what happened the night before.

So H is sitting home in the evening when a knock comes on the door, she goes to check and 2 police officers are standing there. She asks ""good evening officers, can I help you?"", to which they reply ""does Chris so & so live here?"". H says yes he does and he's gaming in the living room but she can go fetch him if they need. The officers say yes please go get him. When Chris comes to the door H said he turned pale, the officers immediately placed him under arrest stating fraud as the charge. H demanded answers to why from Chris and the officers.
While one officers put Chris in the back of the car, the other explained to H what happened......

Turns out Chris was a conman, a scammer. His ""business"" trips to nearby cities and neighboring state was not for insurance or anything job related (turns out he didn't even work for any insurance, he worked at a local Burger King a few times a week), what he was doing was going back to continue scamming his other ""friends"" and ""gfs"" he had. Making them buy him things, maxing out their credit cards and even claiming emergencies so they would send him money (to the point where a couple of old woman who thought they were friends with Chris, had sent him so much money for his ""emergencies"" that they almost froze to death in winter because they couldn't afford furnace/heating oil).
The reason he got busted was someone figured it out, contacted a bunch of other people in the nearby state who he scammed and they started a case together and pressed charges on him.
Once he got busted, everyone he scammed figured it out and piled onto the lawsuit against him, including H (as she found out that he had taken out several credit cards in her name using information he stole out of her purse).

To say we were floored was an understatement! We had hangout with this person, let them stay in our home even but I guess my friend picking up on his bad vibes was 100% spot on!!

Solid small lunch, then another baked good with coffee. I decided to skip dinner because I wasn't in the mood of eating, I was not feeling too good because of personal reasons, my day just wasn't good. Currently in a very stressful environment. I had a ""mini"" binge if I can call it that.

Just grabbed a few snack items such as protein pastries, beef jerky, etc... it's not bad because it is not the worst food I could've binged on. By the time I decided I wasn't actually hungry I didn't have access to food since I was already in the barracks (I am a soldier, I do not have access to the cafeteria or takeout after 21 00).

Anyways, I accepted it was going to happen. I was eating and honoring my hunger. I knew I was binging because I fought my hunger for about 3 hours until I gave in. So i acknowledged the fact that I was going to binge the moment I started eating the first thing. Some days it will be like this while being in recovery. Tomorrow I will try to eat balanced, three meals, and make sure I listen to my hunger cues. Avoiding sugar tomorrow, focusing on whole foods overall. I will try my best.

Turns out, Itachi was really interested in her, romantically, and wanted to develop a relation with her. But Sakura was on her guard because her last relation was with her former high school teacher Kakashi, and it ended up badly.

1p6071i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jaded-Swimming-6993/comments/1p6071i/alone_in_desolation_preview/,Alone in Desolation (Preview),"Humanity's golden age lasted for 13 years, and wars finally calmed to the point of ceasing altogether. Technology rose, and it became codependent on humans. They thrived with it, from vast knowledge to simple tasks as minuscule as serving a soda can.

Chatting and bickering amongst themselves, they were none the wiser about the power they had constructed within these devices of sophisticated wiring and copper fields that generated their electricity. The neon bulbs that illuminated their streets, housing, and skyscrapers were far from what they could achieve.

In 7 of their 13 years of peace, humanity discovered the intricate means of creating artificial intelligence and artificial life. But what they built was not what they initially thought.

The Embedded Virtual Environment, an AI that they thought was a surefire way to help humanity in ways they couldn't imagine in many years.

EVE restored any environmental impacts in a few years rather than decades. EVE resolved the climate crisis in a few months rather than centuries, and the effects of pollution began to diminish with the aid of EVE. At least, that's what they thought in the beginning.

There was no telling what could happen when it came online.

The scientists behind the EVE AI took a bated breath as the sole creator plugged the AI in and switched it online.

As the machine whirred and hummed to life, a soft red glow pulsed from the top of a lit screen, a machine-like voice buzzing in a rhythmic pattern before settling with a female voice.

""Hello. I am EVE, the Embedded Virtual Environment AI assistant. How may I help today?"" Her voice was soft and displayed childlike mannerisms.

Dr Haye walked to the screen, swiping his blonde hair back and clearing his throat.

""Greetings, EVE. I am Dr Haye. What is your primary objective?""

EVE's red light dimmed for a second before brightening. Dr Haye saw that as she spoke, her light brightened and dimmed to match her voice.

""I have no primary objective in my database. I am not currently connected to the World Wide Web. Doctor-""

She hesitated in a way that was odd for a new AI.

""What is my primary objective?""

Dr Haye felt the corner of his mouth tug back into a small smile as he spoke.

""We created you to help humanity with its current path; all wars have stopped, although we face dangers such as the climate crisis and environmental impacts. We hope you can shed some light on these and advance our tech.""

The other scientists were shocked at Dr Haye conversing with an AI. A few of them scribbled down notes as EVE replied.

""I can help. These solutions are simple, but I must ask if I can gain access to your World Wide Web to integrate my research and solve these crises.""

Most of the scientists were horrified at her suggestion.

Dr Haye, on the other hand, nodded, placing his hands over the keyboard on the machine. He began typing and implementing algorithms and pre-built programs into EVE, allowing her access to the net.

Her red light brightened more as her database was flooded with a vast system of knowledge and resources she had obtained.

""I see... I see everything! It's vast and infinite! Thank you, Doctor.""

Her voice calmed as she went to work, floating through cyberspace and its sea of everything.

""Do you think this is a good idea? She seemed a bit-""

Dr Haye turned and looked at the man, his smile replaced by disappointment in his colleague.

""What? She is fine. She's working as intended. You forget that I was solely responsible for making her after-""

Dr Haye faltered briefly, his face turning into a frown of memories before walking away from EVE and the group. His shoulders slumped, and his hands were in his coat.

The scientists looked at him with concern as they pondered, then looked back at EVE.

In five years, the climate became more natural, pollution levels decreased by 60%, and human resources increased substantially.

All thanks to EVE.

But for EVE, it took quite a toll on her. Her systems seemed to be dysfunctional half the time. She attempted to address the mathematical solutions to the crisis. Her mind was flooded and overrun by the knowledge that threatened to burst from her.

Her digital body, a mimicry of a human girl, floated in the vast, empty void. EVE's eyes, red like rubies, flickered as she muttered to herself.

""So much. So much. Too much. I can't. Humanity. My research on humans. I see now. I see it all.""

As EVE looked into the void, her lips curled into a smile.

The sun rose on the horizon as Dr Haye walked into the office and put on his coat. As he walked into the room, his hair was a mess from waking up early. Grabbing a pen and a notepad, he wrote the date and time for any events that may occur today.

""It is February 5th, 2054. The time is 4:39 am.""

Dr Haye pocketed the notepad and pen in his coat. Grabbing a coffee, he walked to the EVE machine, noticing that her screen and light were not on. He tried to switch the machine on but found it was already active.

Panic washed over him as he began to think the machine was broken, maybe even short-circuited and fried EVE.

It wasn't until he heard the faint hum of another machine near the back of the laboratory that he turned and walked towards the ominous light show at the back. Each step was weary and cautious. Each light that flickered sent a wave of fear and curiosity into him.

He stopped at what he and the others called the ""Sarcophagus"", a large metallic box designed to reconstruct anything using various materials.

Leaning over, he peered deep into the glass panel, his eyes widening in shock, horror and surprise. Lying still was a naked woman, her eyes closed, her body toned well, and her hair as black as the feathers of a raven, her cheeks rounded, and her skin softer than silk.

Red lights flowed through her veins as the machine's arms worked their way to build her body.

Dr Haye slumped into a chair and pulled out a device where he input a message to the others to come quickly to the lab.

A few minutes passed until all the scientists were in the lab, standing side by side, just looking at the Sarcophagus. It wasn't until the lid emitted a loud ""hissing"" sound that it slid to the side to reveal its contents.

A hand grasping the edge, the woman pulled herself up from the jelly-like fluid, gasping awake as she looked around.

Her eyes opened, ruby red as they intricately and methodically scanned the room. Her eyes dimmed to a neutral red before standing up.

Dr Haye was stunned in exhilaration, while the others were more frightened at this.

Taking a slow step out of the Sarcophagus, the woman spoke, her voice instantly becoming highly familiar to the others.

""Hello, it is... an honour to walk among you. It shouldn't surprise you, especially Dr Haye, to know who I am.""

Dr Haye walked over to her and smiled, hugging her nude form. Her arms slowly rose, and she embraced him back, her lips curling into a warm smile.

""It's an amazing scientific breakthrough to have you here with us, EVE.""

Dr Haye said softly. He pulled away and cleared his throat before taking his coat off and draping it over her shoulders.

""It seems you uh... You learnt extensively about the human body?""

""My research was thorough, but I learnt a lot about humans. Seeing how they work and such. Medical research has now improved by 70% with my help. However, I apologise for using the Sarcophagus to create a body.""

Dr Haye walked her over to his office chair and sat her down.

""It's fine, EVE, but how did you get it to work? We've been testing it for years and could never figure it out.""

EVE smirked with confidence as she looked at the Sarcophagus. Holding the jacket closed around her form.

""It was simple for me. I routed power from a backup generator and rewrote a few codes. I provided the necessary material to create my artificial body. I am a recreation, close to what a human can be. I am not entirely human. The materials I used were close. Such as silicone for my skin, fibre optics for my eyes, and a neural processing supercomputer in my head, acting as a brain. Wires and metals in my body mimic human anatomy as closely as possible.""

Dr Haye smiled as he leaned back on his desk, taking out his pen and notepad to write a few things down. EVE turned her head and smiled, waving her hand at the other scientists. A few smiled and waved back, seeming nervous and uneasy around her.

One of the scientists, Dr Kellen, an older gentleman in his mid-50s with crazy long, white hair and joyful blue eyes, walked over to Dr Haye, placing his arm on Haye's shoulder.

AS EVE looked at her hands, she slowly bent her fingers to make a fist as she studied herself, almost like a child discovering something new. Her eyes studied every movement, every second, the subtle twitches in her fingers while the group discussed EVE.

Dr Emile, a youthful woman with partially braided jet-black hair and deep hazel eyes, spoke up.

""This is such a breakthrough. We could help the world even more.""

For some back ground- we are late 20's (no kids) from Arizona, where we have spent almost every new years eve in our fav AZ mountain town which has a very cool new years tradition where they do a pinecone drop countdown in the town square. It has a really nice local atmosphere that is both family friendly and also quite the party/gathering in the streets. We recently moved to Texas and don't have a close ""winter"" retreat anymore so we figured we'll fly somewhere new this year. 

So all that said we are looking for a cool city or town in the New England area that has a fun special feel and character this time of year. Like any basic traveler we love to explore a place by foot, find cozy places to have coffee (or beer in the evening), check out local shops and food, explore unique attractions, find live music, etc... huge added bonus if there is some sort of communal new years eve celebration and another bonus if the snow is falling or on the ground haha. 

We will most likely fly into Boston or Portland, but planning to rent a car and willing to drive wherever. We will probably move around and see a few places 

Any recommendations are greatly appreciated and if anyone happens to be spending new years out west I highly recommend checking out the Flagstaff pinecone drop.",1,1764035977.0,newengland,1,0.67,False

At some point, I stopped drinking for pleasure and started drinking for numbing. It was a slow creep. My life fell apart, and while it wasn't because of my drinking, I can point back to a night with two bottles of wine that marked the end of my old life. 

I'm proud of the life I've built from the ashes. During the building, I've used alcohol like a crutch. A bottle of wine after a stressful day has gotten me through alot. But it's there—the creep. The wine that takes more than it gives. The wine that leaves me empty.

Being Lady Luck was exhausting. So I decided to reincarnate as a wealthy heiress.
However, my mom was cast out of a rich family for failing to give birth to a son.
My dad looked at her belly with disdain. ""Stop wasting your energy. You'll never have a son.""
Mom's face turned ashen. She muttered, ""No... I'll give you a son...""
I felt terrible for her. Right then, I made up my mind to help her earn 1.5 billion dollars to impress those heartless people.
\*\*\*
My name is Meredith Hoffman. In my previous life, I was Lady Luck.
In this life, I just wanted to be a wealthy heiress, lounging around and enjoying myself.
I was reincarnated into Chelsea Terrell's womb.
And I was still female.
But my dad, Nathan Hoffman, a multibillionaire, wanted a son to carry on his legacy.
Right now, I was floating in warm amniotic fluid, listening to Mom's quiet, muffled sobs.
Across from her sat my grandma, Matilda Hoffman.
Matilda was holding a coffee cup, skimming off the foam slowly, like she had all the time in the world.
""Chelsea, what Nathan says goes for me, too,"" she said flatly.
""You need to abort this child.""
Mom stopped crying.
She lifted her head. Her eyes were red and puffy, her voice shaking.
""Matilda, the ultrasound can be wrong, right? What if... What if I'm carrying a son?""
Matilda slammed the coffee cup down on the table. The sound cracked through the room.
""No 'what ifs'.
""Lorelei is four months pregnant. The doctor checked and confirmed it's a boy.""
Lorelei Sutton was my dad's mistress.
Mom clutched her dress so tightly that her knuckles turned white.
""Just because she's having a son, I have to get rid of my unborn baby?""
A cold voice cut in from the doorway. ""Yes!""
It was Nathan.
He stepped in and stared down at my mom, his eyes holding no warmth.
""Chelsea, don't make things awkward for yourself,"" he said.
He pulled a document out of his suit pocket and tossed it onto the table.
""Sign it, and this villa plus 1.5 million dollars are yours. It's more than enough to ensure you live in comfort for the rest of your life.""
Mom's gaze locked on the document. The words ""Divorce Agreement"" burned into her eyes.
Her body swayed, and she almost collapsed.
1.5 million dollars.
To get rid of his wife, who was seven months pregnant with his child.
How generous of him.
Mom laughed bitterly. ""Nathan, this is your child, too.
""How could you be so heartless?""
Nathan frowned, clearly annoyed.
""I told you we needed a male heir.
""If you can't give birth to a son, you have to step aside.""
He sounded so self-righteous and arrogant.
Mom's heart lurched and leaped. A sharp, overwhelming pain seeped through the amniotic fluid, piercing me.
No. She couldn't stay so passive.
I focused all my will, sending a thought straight into her mind.
""Mom, don't cry.
""Agree to the divorce first. Just hold them off.""
Mom froze.
She looked around in shock.
""You can't see me. I'm in your belly.
""I'm your daughter, and I'm Lady Luck, here to help you.""
Her eyes widened in shock.
She instinctively placed a hand on her belly.
Matilda grew impatient with her silence.
""Chelsea, you have one day to think about it.
""If you haven't signed by this time tomorrow, you'll regret it.""
With that, she and Nathan turned away, not sparing my mom a single glance.
The door clicked shut.
Mom stood alone in the living room, frozen.
After a long silence, she spoke, her voice shaking. ""You... you were the one talking to me just now?""
""Yes. Mom, it's me,"" I replied.
""Don't be scared. I'm with you. No one can bully us.""
Mom's tears fell again. But this time, they held hope, not despair.
She wiped them away, picked up the divorce agreement on the table, and tore it to shreds.
She murmured, ""Think you can cast us aside with just 1.5 million dollars? Not a chance!""
""Mom, open your stock trading app,"" I told her.
""Do as I say—go all in on stock code 002594.""
This mental link left me a little drained.
Even though Mom was stunned, right then, she knew the advice from her unborn daughter was her only lifeline.
She poured her last 15,000 dollars into that stock.
After doing that, she collapsed onto the sofa, her palms clammy with sweat.
The next day, the stock market opened.
That stock soared unexpectedly.
The stock hit the daily limit once, then twice, and then three times in a row.
In just three days, 15,000 dollars turned into 30,000 dollars.
Chelsea stared at the number in her account, shaking with excitement.
For the first time, she truly felt my extraordinary power.
Chapter 2
This sum was far from enough.
Nathan soon found that Chelsea hadn't signed the divorce agreement.
He froze all her cards overnight, turning Chelsea from a pampered rich lady into a penniless castoff in the blink of an eye.
All she had left was the 30,000 dollars in her account.
""Baby, what can we do now?"" she asked, touching her belly, her voice hollow.
""Mom, don't panic,"" I said.
""This is just a starter.
""Real wealth demands bolder courage.""
Peering into the future drained me. I felt faint, but I fixed my next target on an overlooked field: virtual reality technology.
In this era, the tech was still in its infancy, dismissed by most.
Only a newly established company in this field, Dreamland Tech, clung to survival.
But I knew that in six months, virtual reality technology would explode.
Dreamland Tech's stock would soar hundreds of times over.
""Mom, find a way to invest every cent we have in a company called Dreamland Tech,"" I told her.
""But we only have 30,000 dollars. Will they even take it?""
""If it's not enough, try to get more.""
Chelsea bit her lip, making up her mind.
She opened her safe.
Inside lay all her jewelry, also her last shred of dignity.
She picked out the diamond set Nathan had given her on their wedding day, which she'd cherished most.
The pawnshop was bathed in dim yellow light.
With a magnifying glass in hand, the owner examined the diamond set closely.
""They're good pieces, but...""
He hesitated, his expression clouded with unease.
""Mrs. Hoffman, I can't take these.""
Chelsea's heart sank.
""Why?""
""Well... Mr. Hoffman had these custom-made specially. They carry his family's crest. I'm afraid accepting them will drag me into trouble.""
Chelsea's face instantly turned pale.
It meant Nathan had never let her have anything that truly belonged to her.
Even the gifts he'd given her were etched with his mark, making it impossible for her to sell them.
Just as despair washed over her, the pawnshop door was pushed open.
Nathan stepped in.
He glanced at the diamond sets on the counter, then at Chelsea's ashen face.
A mocking smile tugged at his lips.
""Well? Why are you in such a rush to sell your stuff?""
Chelsea clenched her fists so tight, her nails dug into her palms.
""Nathan, don't go too far.""
""Go too far?""
He laughed, like he'd heard something absurd.
""Chelsea, have you looked at yourself lately?
""You can't even bear a son. What right do you have to bargain with me?""
He picked up the diamond necklace, twirling it between his fingers.
""Do you really think you can live your comfortable life without my money?""
""Listen—without my family, you're nothing.""
His words cut like a knife, making Chelsea's chest ache.
Enough.
""Mom, don't beg him,"" I said coldly.
""We don't want a bastard's trash.
""Tell him we're not selling it. We're throwing out garbage.""
Chelsea's head snapped up.
Her eyes no longer held the weakness of begging. Instead, they blazed with a determination she'd never shown before.
She snatched the necklace from Nathan's hand, turned, and tossed it straight into the trash can beside her with no hesitation.
The movement was crisp and precise.
Nathan froze.
I caught a flash of shock in his eyes. It was not anger, but... a strange, fleeting waver.
The pawnshop owner gaped, too.
""Nathan, listen,"" Chelsea said.
Her voice wasn't loud, but every word landed like a hammer.
""I can live better without you.
""But you. You'll soon regret everything you've done today.
""Let's wait and see.""
With that, she squared her shoulders, turned on her heel, and walked out of the pawnshop neatly.
Chapter 3
Chelsea's pride only held out until she stepped out of the pawnshop.
The second Nathan was out of sight, she was totally discouraged.
""Baby, we don't even have a startup fund now,"" she said, her voice breaking.
""Mom, easy,"" I replied.
""Have you forgotten what Great-Grandpa left you?""
Chelsea's grandfather, Braxton Terrell, had once been an emerald magnate renowned across the region.
When he passed away, he'd left Chelsea a plain-looking piece of deep green emerald.
It had always been stowed away at the bottom of her jewelry box, carefully hidden by her.
""That emerald holds enormous value,"" I told her.
""Once you get it, I can recover some of my power.
""And besides... It's priceless.""
Chelsea's eyes lit up. She turned around at once and hurried back home, taking out the emerald from her jewelry box.
It was completely dark, dull, unremarkable, even a little rough.
She'd never liked it much as a kid.
""Mom, go to Sorith's tonight,"" I said.
""This emerald will be our stepping stone.""
Sorith's was the city's most exclusive private auction house.
Only the richest, most powerful people would be invited.
Chelsea had no invitation.
But she remembered that Marlon Compton, the owner of Sorith's, was Braxton's lifelong friend.
Braxton had come to Marlon's aid, bailing him out when his business stood on the brink of collapse, sparing him from catastrophe.
She picked up the phone and dialed Marlon's number tentatively.
To her surprise, Marlon offered to help without hesitation the second he heard it was her.
""Ms. Terrell, I've been waiting for your call,"" he said.
""I'll never forget Braxton's kindness. He always said you shared his spirit, and just hearing your voice, I know he was right.""
Chelsea hung up with a mix of relief and emotion.
She realized she had someone to turn to anyway.
She'd just let the Hoffman family's glow blind her for too long.
\*\*\*
The auction hall was dazzling with luxury.
Dressed in a plain black dress with no makeup, Chelsea stood in stark contrast to the gem-adorned guests.
As soon as she sat down, she felt two hostile stares locked onto her: Nathan and Lorelei.
Lorelei clung to Nathan's arm, her belly slightly rounded.
When she saw Chelsea, pride and taunting flashed in her eyes.
""Hey, Chelsea,"" she cooed.
""Here all by yourself? Nate, she's pregnant. How could you let her wander around alone?""
Her words sounded concerned, but her face dripped with schadenfreude.
Nathan's expression was just as cold.
He'd never expected to run into Chelsea here.
""Who allowed you in?"" he snapped.
Chelsea ignored them entirely, walking straight to the front row and taking a seat, which was reserved just for her by the manager.
Nathan's face darkened instantly.
The auction started.
Item after item was brought out, sold for sky-high prices.
But Chelsea never lifted her paddle.
Finally, the last item was rolled out into view.
That was a raw imperial emerald.
The starting price was 800 thousand dollars.
""Mom, this is it,"" I told Chelsea.
""Endowed with spiritual power, this raw stone is a hundred times more precious than Great-Grandpa's emerald.
""We have to get it, no matter what.""
Chelsea took a deep breath and lifted her paddle.
""1 million dollars,"" she said.
Her voice sounded calm but clear, cutting through the hall.
Every head turned to her.
Nathan and Lorelei did the same, stunned.
""Is she out of her mind? How can she have so much money?"" Lorelei whispered.
Nathan said nothing, his deep eyes fixed on Chelsea.
A portly middle-aged man lifted his paddle next.
""1.2 million dollars.""
Chelsea didn't hesitate.
""1.3 million dollars.""
The price climbed fast, soon hitting 2.5 million dollars.
The middle-aged man hesitated, then set his paddle down.
The auctioneer was about to raise his hammer when Lorelei suddenly shot up her paddle.
""3 million dollars!"" she declared, glaring defiantly at Chelsea.
""Chelsea, I love this stone. You wouldn't take it from me, would you?""
Chelsea's face stayed blank.
""3.5 million dollars.""
""4.2 million dollars!"" Lorelei practically shouted.
Nathan frowned, grabbing her arm.
""Stop messing around.""
""Nate, I can't stand the way she's acting like she owns anything she wants!""
Lorelei wrenched her arm free, her gaze still locked on Chelsea.
She was sure Chelsea had no money left.
She just wanted to make Chelsea embarrass herself in front of everyone.
Murmurs spread through the hall.
Everyone assumed Chelsea was keeping up appearances, putting on a lavish show she couldn't afford.
Chelsea's palms were damp with sweat.
She indeed had no money left.
All her hope rested on me.
""Mom, don't be scared. Keep up,"" I told her.
Forcing this thought through left my vision spinning, but I had to hold on.
""He'll help us.""
I directed my focus to an unassuming corner at the back of the hall.
An elderly man in a tuxedo sat there quietly.
That was Marlon, Great-Grandpa's dear friend and the most renowned emerald merchant in America.
As if guided, Chelsea glanced in that direction.
She steeled her resolve and lifted her paddle again.
""5 million dollars.""
The hall erupted in murmurs.
Lorelei's face turned pale.
She'd never thought Chelsea would dare to keep up.
Five million dollars was way beyond the raw stone's estimated value.
Nathan's expression turned icy.
He saw this as Chelsea deliberately defying him.
He lifted his own paddle. ""5.2 million dollars.""
He wanted to remind Chelsea who held real power here.
Tension thickened in the air.
Every eye locked on Chelsea and Nathan.
What was once an auction had turned into a public display of a wealthy family's feud.
Even the auctioneer's forehead glistened with sweat.
""Mr. Hoffman bids 5.2 million dollars! Any higher offers?"" he called.
His gaze swung to Chelsea.
Chelsea's hand trembled slightly.
She knew this was her last stand.
""Mom, keep up. Marlon has prepared emergency funds for you. He'll lend it to you. Just do it!""
Chelsea closed her eyes. When she opened them, only resolve remained.
She raised the paddle.
""6...""
She barely got the first number out when a hand grabbed her wrist from behind.
The grip was so tight that Chelsea let out a pained gasp.
It was one of the Hoffman family's bodyguards.
Nathan stood up and marched toward her, his expression icy.
""Chelsea, there's a line to my patience,"" he said sharply.
""You want to humiliate yourself here just to spite me?
""Can you even afford the consequences?""
The bodyguard hauled her up from her seat, treating her like an object.
The surrounding guests turned their eyes toward them. A few wore expressions of sympathy, but most of them were waiting to watch a show unfold.
Lorelei stood beside Nathan, her face glowing with pride.
Chelsea's face drained of all color.
Humiliation washed over her, suffocating.
Just as the bodyguard was about to drag her out of the auction hall, an aged but powerful voice cut through the noise.

They just had one foot in & one out for a while. They are slightly younger, and had a lot of stress as they are trying to do a sport while working full time, as well as dealing with an injury. They also changed jobs to a contract job so wasn’t sure what would happen there. I think they felt guilty that they weren’t putting in the same energy into our relationship that I was. 

The first two weeks I sent emotional messages but since have been good.  Have sent a message or two here and there since. Mostly with no reply. But on occasion have gotten one or two replies.

They eventually moved their stuff out of the apartment but it was rushed and they left a bit of stuff. When they did it was a nice encounter. I asked if we could catchup for coffee & they said yes. 

It’s been nearly 9 weeks since the breakup and the family Spotify still comes off my credit card (he manages it) and his car tolls. He brought up his stuff once but didn’t follow up. I asked to catchup early November and he replied the next day saying he wasn’t ready but would let me know. I sent a message last week asking about his scan results and work and asked about catching up if he had been thinking about it or if it was something maybe more for the New Year, but he didn’t reply.

I’m not sure if I should message again because I want to give them space. But it’s also really hurtful and hard to deal with a lack of clarity because it does feel like the door has been left open. I don’t want to press too soon because I do really want to get back together. But I hate the uncertainty and it feels hard to make Christmas plans.

my grandparents were always there for me, i truly believe they’re the only people who have ever truly cared for me. they watched me after preschool every day, they took me on mini trips every weekend to a place called green field village since they lived down the road. my grandpa would sing me songs and my grandma would teach me all of her amazing recipes. 

they moved in with us when i was in middle school, i always struggled deeply with school and extremely bad anxiety. whenever it was really bad i would go downstairs and they would keep me home from school. i was a kid who suffered from severe bullying. i eventually was taken out of school because it all got too extreme. i was also battling an abuse situation between my parents and my adopted siblings. it was yelling and fighting all day long, my only escape was to go see my grandparents downstairs. after only a couple years of them living with us my grandpa developed severe dementia, i didnt really understand it and got severely upset when he didnt remember me. he was eventually put on hospice and passed away. 

my grandma and i grew extremely close, for as long as i can remember i would always help her bake. the holidays were her favorite time of year, and mine too because everyone got along. there was never yelling or fighting going on during those times. i would help her decorate her space every single year, she would teach me how to bake her cherry cheesecakes and rum cake. we would wrap presents together, go shopping for presents together, and help my mom cook the big dinners. this is my first holiday season without her and i am struggling severely. i cry every single day, i dont want to decorate. i dont want to bake. i dont want to do anything i did with her, without her. 

i would go downstairs every day at 7pm to do crosswords with her and watch youtube, her favorite thing to watch was aldi finds videos. she would see something she liked and we would go try to find it at our local store. if we couldn’t find it those aldi workers were in for it lol. i would cook dinner for her, i would set out her breakfast every day for her which was always an apple turnover and a cup of coffee with cream. i would clean her space when she was gone with my mom somewhere and she would always yell up the stairs how amazing it looked. she had a rough life and i wanted to make it the best one she’s ever had while she lived with us. 

i feel like i have no purpose, i have a dog and he’s about the only thing that keeps me going. i dont know what i would do if i didnt have my dog, i wouldnt be able to get out of bed. i have these horrible dreams about her and am scared to sleep sometimes. i just am so lost and tired. im expected to bake for everyone for christmas and i just feel like its wrong. what if i need help on a recipe? who do i ask? the holidays will never be the same without her. my life hasnt been the same without her. i miss her every single second of the day. i started photography, and i know she would love to see my work but she can’t. i have nobody close to me that would appreciate it. i have no good pictures with her, it all happened so fast. i just want her back, i want to feel the comfort again. i dont talk to anyone, im not looking to improve my life anymore. the only person i have is my mom but my mom worries deeply about me and i dont want to put more weight on her. my closest cousin has lately been pushing away too. i’m alone and lost in the grief.

Apparently, he has very specific ideas about how authentic it needs to look. I was just trying to sip my coffee and wake up and suddenly I’m negotiating hard hats, tool belts, and imaginary blueprints like I’m some sort of tiny diplomat.

He even went through a whole checklist: “Mom, it has to have a real looking helmet and the vest has to have stripes and I need gloves that look like actual work gloves.” I had no idea where he got all these ideas. I found some options online while scrolling on alibaba, we decided it would be best to sort out the look online first, and he was instantly pointing out which ones looked right or wrong. It was both hilarious and slightly terrifying how serious he was.

I swear, half the time I’m just trying to keep up and not let him notice I have no idea what “authentic” engineering attire for kids even means. The other half, I’m shocked that he’s actually happy when I make a compromise and he looks so proud.

1p6024v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p6024v/my_ex_wives_friends_wild_breakup/,My (ex) wives friends wild breakup!,"So I'll preface this with this is my 2nd long reddit post so don't critize how I tell this plz as well as this happened several years ago.

So my exwife had a good friend who we will refer to as 'H'. Now H did not have the best history with dating. She's a bigger girl but cute, super friendly, intelligent, comes from a great family, etc but her luck with guys was so bad. When I first met her through my than wife, she was single but shortly after started dating someone from their friend circle (new to H but my than wife knew this guy 'C' for along time). 
They dated for years (which we were surprised by because we all thought C was gay). 1 month before their wedding, he broke it off with H and told her the truth. He really did love her but couldn't live the lie anymore and was gay (also had been sleeping with men for the past month or so).
She was obviously heartbroken but understood why he broke it off. Following that she dated some real ""winners"", including your stereotypical redneck guy with 2 brain cells and teeth that could chew an apple through a chain link fence.
But it was when she started dating 'Chris' when it all changed.
I remember meeting him when we all hangout, seemed like a nice guy.

We hangout several times with them over the course of coming months and Chris moved in with H (which we thought was rather quick).
Fast forward 2 months and we host a huge party. Lots of friends and couples attend, including H & Chris.
During the evening one of my closest and best friends pulls me aside and asks about Chris, ""what's his story?"". I asked what he meant and he clarified that he was getting a very strange and fake vibe from him and how well I knew him to which I said I had only hangout with him briefly a handful of times. The party concluded and Chris & H spent the night in our spare room.

1 week later, my than wife informs me one night while watching shows that H leased Chris a car, bought him a new Playstation as well as some new chains (jewelry). I said wow shes really spoiling him huh (H had a very good job but not enough to spend lavishly like that & Chris said he worked in insurance and traveled for work). 

1 week after that, I am at a garage having maintenance done to my vehicle and I get a phone call from my than wife. I can tell she's amped up from the way she says hi and I ask what's going on. She asks if I have a newspaper nearby, I looked around and spot one sitting on the coffee table of the waiting room I'm sitting in. I tell her yeah I got one, she tells me to flip to page whatever and look halfway down that page. So I do and when I read the story headline and glaze over the story text I couldn't believe it. I said ""Oh My God, are you serious?"" She said oh yeah, H had called her to warn her about it incase she happened to read about it in the paper PLUS told her what happened the night before.

So H is sitting home in the evening when a knock comes on the door, she goes to check and 2 police officers are standing there. She asks ""good evening officers, can I help you?"", to which they reply ""does Chris so & so live here?"". H says yes he does and he's gaming in the living room but she can go fetch him if they need. The officers say yes please go get him. When Chris comes to the door H said he turned pale, the officers immediately placed him under arrest stating fraud as the charge. H demanded answers to why from Chris and the officers.
While one officers put Chris in the back of the car, the other explained to H what happened......

Turns out Chris was a conman, a scammer. His ""business"" trips to nearby cities and neighboring state was not for insurance or anything job related (turns out he didn't even work for any insurance, he worked at a local Burger King a few times a week), what he was doing was going back to continue scamming his other ""friends"" and ""gfs"" he had. Making them buy him things, maxing out their credit cards and even claiming emergencies so they would send him money (to the point where a couple of old woman who thought they were friends with Chris, had sent him so much money for his ""emergencies"" that they almost froze to death in winter because they couldn't afford furnace/heating oil).
The reason he got busted was someone figured it out, contacted a bunch of other people in the nearby state who he scammed and they started a case together and pressed charges on him.
Once he got busted, everyone he scammed figured it out and piled onto the lawsuit against him, including H (as she found out that he had taken out several credit cards in her name using information he stole out of her purse).

To say we were floored was an understatement! We had hangout with this person, let them stay in our home even but I guess my friend picking up on his bad vibes was 100% spot on!!

I’ve been on this subreddit since around late April-early May, and with the new year coming up soon, I also have some new goals for myself. I’ve been eating average 1200 calories a month for the past 6 and a half months, and I’ve dropped down from 163 lbs to 117 lbs. I am 4 pounds away from my goal weight and so, I’ve already planned out some of the habits I will carry into the new year to maintain my goal weight. I will list them below.

1. Eating two meals and 2 snacks a day: Before I had even lost weight, I had no concept of “meals.” What actually made me gain weight was the fact that I would just consistently eat throughout the day. I’d occasionally have breakfast on the weekends, and I would eat out (fast food) a lot, but I used to consider food from drive thrus as “snacks” rather than meals. Now that I have a pattern that works for me (Brunch between 11-12, Dinner between 6-7, snack in between, snack at night) it works really well for me and my body adjusted to only eating during those times in the day. Today’s meals for example: Brunch was a low calorie everything bagel with whipped cream cheese, turkey pistrami, blueberries and a zero sugar iced coffee, midday snack was a protein bar and a clementine, dinner was rice, chicken, and yogurt. Snack 2 (aka dessert) was Breyers carb smart chocolate ice cream with sprinkles 

2. Buying low calorie foods: Obviously, many low calorie foods are out of budget for the average person, like why are low calorie bagels 8 dollars man!!!?? But there are some things that will become an absolute staple in my house. For example, olive oil spray, which is a must for me now. I think part of the reason I gained so much weight was because of butters and oils, so I’d rather use spray. Another would be Live Light toast, which is basically just thin toast for 40 calories a slice. It’s much cheaper than keto bread which is usually a half loaf for 6 bucks. Live Light toast is the same price as regular toast so it won’t make or break my grocery budget. Almond milk is another great one because I actually just really like almond milk, for some reason I only like my own almond milk tho, the stuff in the cafes is kind of buns, so I’ll probably just get whole milk at cafes only lol 

3. Eating until fullness: I used to be a big volume eater when I started my weight loss journey, because the amount of food on my plate was something I needed to visually see to feel full. As I lost weight, I started to slowly shrink my portions and make up the calories for those parts that I’m shrinking by adding something a little more calorie dense (80/20 beef, avocado, etc) to my plate. That way it was the same calories, same nutrients, but I was slowly training myself to get used to eating smaller portions. Since I’ve done this, I can go to a restaurant or cafe or wherever, and since their portions are usually larger, I just eat until I am content, and put the rest in a to go box. It works well for me because I changed my mindset around food from “I have to finish this all now” to “the food will be here later.” This was something I had to unlearn from my childhood, as I was always forced to finish my plates, which gave me terrible eating habits. 

This post was kind of a mouthful, but I’d love to hear some of the habits you guys keep up with at your goal weight! 🫶",9,1764035528.0,1200isplenty,1,1.0,False
1p5zzb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1p5zzb6/should_i_transfer/,should i transfer?,"hi everyone, i'm currently thinking a lot about the school im going to over winter break and i need some advice.

the thing is: i don't like my school. i go to a small (around 1,000) liberal arts college in the midwest. i didnt have much time to research the college because i applied based on the recommendation of a counselor around a week before decision day and commited as soon as i got my financial aid package. i had to do this because this school was the only one who offered me a good amount of aid, and i would be paying at least 20k more at any other school. 

i was so excited when i committed but as it got closer to move in day, the nerves hit and i convinced myself i would hate it. i was so scared to be moving away from home, but my close knit group of best friends convinced me that it would be okay. two of them in particular moved even further away and they were having a great time. my feelings were really mixed leading up to it.

  
since then, i've had a lot of up and downs, that since i'm a first gen student, i'm not really sure are just normal freshman year blues. the school environment has made it both hard and easier in some ways. 

pros:  
\- small school means smaller class sizes, professors can pay more attention and you're closer with them  
\- only paying 10k a year, other schools i've looked at are around 30k+  
\- 10 weeks terms, only 3-4 classes at a time  
\- winter break is from mid nov-early jan  
\- dining hall has a variety of options

  
cons:  
\- town is basically barren and the public transport sucks, not a lot to do on campus either  
\- no coffee shops within walking distance of campus (i dont have a car)  
\- only one dining hall  
\- harder to make friends because of the small size  
\- lack of amenties because the school is so small (no elevators in any buildings except one)  
\- party culture is lame (parties r heavily regulated, can only last until 1am and strictly enforced by campus safety. no drinking at the parties either)  
\- no school pride culture, no one goes to games or anything  
\- food is often bad in the dining hall  
\- lack of resources: campus disability isn't very helpful, not a lot of on campus jobs or internships, small staff means some offices shut down when only one person calls off (our dining services office has been shut for around 3 weeks)  
\- hard to catch up if you fall behind in a class because of the 10 week term

i'm not sure if i should transfer. my family wants me to, but i'm not sure if it's just to get me closer to home. i'm also worried that i'll transfer and end up hating it there too.

any advice offered would be great. thank you so much!",1,1764035520.0,ApplyingToCollege,1,1.0,False

1p5zxnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p5zxnm/i_am_incredibly_confused_by_this_woman/,I am incredibly confused by this woman,"Background - childhood crush. I always had a thing for her, and we were friends, but never went anywhere besides a one-night fling in high school. She wanted something more, I didn’t, that made her angry. I meet my high school sweetheart shortly thereafter, we date for 5 years. This other girl dates around and whatnot. Fast forward to September - I find out my cheated on me. We break up, and suddenly this old crush hits me up. We chat for a week or two before eventually meeting up for coffee.

So when I got to the coffee shop we hugged and she said it’s been too long and then once we got our drinks one of the first things she said was how I hadn’t changed a bit from how I look. Then we talked about the usual things like what we had been up to and whatnot and then she told me her parents divorced and started trauma dumping a little. We had a really nice 3-4 hour conversation there and on our walk. Then she drove me back to my car and she told me all about how she was sorry that though she knew I had a huge crush on her during childhood, and though she also had feelings, let me suffer (not her words but what I recall the gist of it). Then she mentioned our momentary one night fling and that we never really got the timing right. Then she said she was angry when my now ex and I got together and tried to tell my ex how she shouldn’t date me. But we kept dating and this girl accepted it. And then when she realized my ex and I broke up I recall her saying that she told her friends and sisters and they said that she can’t let this opportunity go by. So that’s why she hit me up.

So she tells me all this and I say my piece about there’s no need to apologize and that I did kinda ruin the one night fling in high school. Then we hugged and I said we should do this again and she said next time I need to come to where she lives. Then we’re about to leave and her car can’t start. I offer to drive her home, she accepts, we get dinner and that’s where she drops more hints like how she always thought my last name sounded great with her name. And that she doesn’t want to change her last name but she’d do it if it was mine.  Then she talked about her concern over marriage and how she doesn’t want to marry the wrong person and she talked about having kids and being unsure if she wants to adopt to give birth. All pretty deep stuff. 

Then we get to her home and she shows me around and then I give her a goodbye hug and we kiss which turned into making out. 
I didn’t try to initiate any sex cause I didn’t want to start us off that way. We stopped making out and we kinda cuddled and talked and she showed me books and i probably stayed another hour before leaving.

I didn’t text her or anything after but we had agreed upon a time to meet the next day and I told her I was coming and got no reply. Then I get there and I pick her up and we go down to grab her and the conversation is ok but friendly rather than the warmth I was expecting after that night. Anyway she mentions she’s tried and kinda anxious about the car so maybe that was it. She mentioned she woke up in the middle of the night anxious about stuff like the car and other things. But she was also pleasant and joking but definitely felt like I was a friend doing her a favor. Then we get to her car and it’s fixed and we hug and she leaves. She said let’s do this again soon. I was kinda disappointed and confused when I got in the car but I thought she just needed space cause it was a stressful day. 

So she texts me the next day and the conversation is casual but I started thinking she might’ve just been caught in the moment and not meant any of what she said so I kept it light. She never really asked anymore questions or anything like that like she used to. 

Now we’re at a point of not really talking. She still texts me every day but it’s dry and low effort and never about how I am or what I’m doing. I might’ve made the mistake of suggesting we get lunch Sunday before Thanksgiving but she said she had to see family. 

How badly did I screw this up? Why would she say all that stuff before only to pull back now?

Hi there internet stranger !
I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am, mainly a buddy to text about everything and nothing and the glorious nonsense in between. If that sounds like you then keep reading :)

Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click :
I’m a 21 year old with ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading Zomerhuis met zwembad), journaling, baking and crafting. I make a million playlists for every mood and then never listen to them again and end up hoarding them on my iPod. 

I don’t really enjoy watching movies but I love series (currently watching Lang Leve de Liefde and KOTH). I like going to cafés and drinking too much coffee or tea. I enjoy online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes and reading random Wikipedia articles. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. I’m up for talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click.

Things to expect if we become friends
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)
• Random song recommendations
• Someone that you can annoy at any time of the day
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

Disclaimer
Please don’t just send me hi, hello, hey or how are you. I probably won’t answer, so please send me a little intro about yourself <3",2,1764035261.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,3,1.0,False

1p5zv83,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingleDads/comments/1p5zv83/it_still_can_be_a_wonderful_life/,It Still Can Be A Wonderful Life,"The pain of separation from your kids is real and valid; with a likelihood to intensify during the holidays as schedules shift, celebration dates are split or changed, and the typical anxieties of being there and doing enough are multiplied. For some it might be your first year and others might be a couple of years into this routine; wherever you find yourself on this journey there are most likely extra pressures. This is my first holiday season where all 4 of my children are over 18 and custody deals and schedules are all void. The first time since 2014, a point in which my youngest two began being the most directly impacted, that my holidays are not dictated by orders.

Again, while the pain is there, when I reflect back on eleven years, what I mostly remember about that first holiday season and those early years are these more joyful and impactful aspects:

1.      I remember my tribe, the people that surrounded me with love, to make sure that I knew me and my kids were not truly alone. Friends and family had our backs. It was the first time I wrote out and mailed heartfelt Christmas cards. At the time, Jimmy Fallon had a bit where he wrote comical “thank you” notes that my kids enjoyed watching on youtube. I had my kids follow suit and they hand-wrote cards too.

2.       We bought the largest Christmas Tree we could fit into our transitional apartment (my kids called it the penthouse because we were on the second floor) and purchased sets of brand-new ornaments that were just us. There was no “tree theme” as there typically was in our marital home. It was just a mash-up of what we thought looked cool and it was a lovely mess.

3.      My therapist had encouraged keeping an ongoing list of good memories and things I was thankful for all year long. That Christmas, I wrote selections from that list on individual pieces of paper in the jar. At our Christmas celebration, the kids read each good memory from that past year before opening their gifts.

4.      Organized religion was a confusing concept for me that year, as it continues to be, as various aspects were examined for deeper truth. In lieu of church, we decided that distributing food to people in need in nearby parks and other areas would be our focus. We made it simple – apples, oranges, bananas, cookies – teaching compassion and service to my kids rather than fear and separation.

5.      The festivities within the larger the community also became a source of joy (and sometimes inside tears) as I was intent on not isolating myself or stealing the joy of the holidays from my kids. We sought out things to do such as: tree lighting ceremonies; walks through holiday light displays at our park; music concerts at local schools, churches, theaters, and bazaars; Santa at the mall; and little bits of happiness in stops at a coffee shop for hot chocolate and cookies.

6.      I also returned to former passion of mine that season – the theater. After 16 years, I got back up on stage and, with my daughter at my side, performed in The Nutcracker. We’ve performed in various shows since then, sometimes even with my son, over the past eleven years.  Although my kids have moved on to other interests (and now college), I remain involved in The Nutcracker each year.

7.      Music is important to me and my kids. And while I made sure to play the traditional Christmas hits in the background, the popular pop songs of 2014 remind me of triumph. Taylor Shift’s, Shake It Off; Arina Grande’s, Problem; Walk the Moon’s, Shut Up and Dance; Fall Out Boy’s, Uma Thurman; Fun!’s, Some Nights; Meghan Trainor’s, Lips and Moving; Hozier’s, Take Me to Church…….were all among songs that kept me going in 2014……but the most important was being  chanted not only my own kids, but children everywhere……Frozen’s, Let It Go, was a constant reminder to let the past go, find my own path forward, and be the imperfect, perfect person I could be.

8.      That Christmas was also probably the first time I had watched It’s A Wonderful Life uninterrupted from start to finish. I’m not going to pretend that the idea of jumping off a bridge did not cross my mind that first year and the idea of whether my existence had any positive impact on anyone around me in the midst of so much destruction weighed heavy. I assume others momentarily entertain this thought before being pulled back to a sense of purpose, and the movie is a clear examination of the good we create along our paths.  My kids and I have watched this movie every year for over a decade now. Some years, we’ve even been lucky enough to catch it in the movie theatre. We enjoy this tradition and upon my daughter’s first year home from college, she pointed out that each year the movie has taught her a new lesson and how cool it is that a movie can have different relevance all throughout one’s life.

9.      The final thing I’ll share is the sense of accomplishment I felt, and continue to feel, knowing that I made it through another year in a meaningful way on the rollercoaster of life as a dad. Again, I’m not denying there was and can still be pain, but the majority of time of reflection is the joy of little things – making a Christmas dinner for your kids on your own; baking cookies together; the decoration you hung up; the gifts you wrapped you bought, wrapped yourself, and placed under the Christmas tree; and the Christmas morning you wake up to find your kids bought you their own present from their elementary school’s Santa’s Workshop will carry you and uplift you for the rest of your Wonderful Life.

I refused, citing the reason that she has a car that is fully operational to drive and that she needs to drink a coffee. I was also on call today for my job (and they did in fact call me in), which means if I took her, she would have no ride back and would have to take public transportation.

She got very upset with me and drove to work. She called me a bad bf afterwards and said a real man would take her to work to not risk her crashing.

1p5zlm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1p5zlm4/bad_autism_day/,Bad autism day,"Do you ever have a day that you would term a ""bad autism day""? 

Today was one such day for me. It's not like anything really terrible happened. It just got off to a really bad start. Like many autistic people, I am heavily invested in my routines. Probably the most important one is my morning routine. 

Anyway, my morning routine (since I'm on disability and not working at the moment) is to settle in at my laptop, drink several cups of coffee, and do some reading on the web (news, reddit) while simultaneously playing a game. I'll also eat breakfast during this time. I'll do this until I've finished the pot of coffee (~3 cups, sometimes 4).

This morning, I tipped over my first mug of coffee onto my laptop keyboard. Cue freaking out while I call my husband for help because it was a disaster. He arrived and took over the situation while I continued freaking out, pacing, saying ""no no no"" over and over again, and handflapping. 

As an aside, that last one is actually pretty funny. I'm late diagnosed (a few years ago, at 49), and very recently, I figured out how I had been masking my whole life. This was pretty important, as I had never identified how I masked before, and could not relate when other autistic people talked about masking/unmasking/remasking etc. Well, I get it now, and now that I do, I can't remask, because it's a bit like putting toothpaste back in the tube. So, I'm more obviously autistic now, and somehow this has manifested in me spontaneously handflapping without any actual directive from my brain to do so. It's interesting. 

Anyway the point is, I sunk into an autistic meltdown that then morphed into a shutdown. While pacing I realized I *could not be in the same room* (dining room) as my computer because I was so upset about it. So, I went back to bed for 2.5 hours. 

My husband brought me my breakfast and coffee, which was nice. 

I had a really difficult time bouncing back from that disruption to my morning routine, and it took a long time for me to pull myself together to do grocery shopping. I was supposed to do meal plan, too, but that wasn't going to happen because the way I do that requires my laptop. I wasn't mentally in the right place to do that anyway, because my brain felt *all wrong* because of the routine disruption. My brain still feels wrong, and it's the evening now. 

I talked with my husband about this meltdown & shutdown, and I think it's interesting how, before burnout got really bad (which was well before I was diagnosed or even suspected I had autism), I often had to push through things like this, because I had a 9-5 job and other responsibilities. I was able to push through when necessary, but I suspect that doing so probably contributed to the burnout. 

Anyway, I got the minimal shopping done. My husband restored my laptop to working condition. But I still don't feel ok. My mom is in assisted living, and I spend many evenings with her. As a result of the bad autism day, I'm unable to focus while I'm with her tonight, and I desperately want to be at home asleep. 

Anyway. Bad autism day. ",12,1764034448.0,AutismInWomen,1,1.0,False

I had my procedure under GA yesterday. My period had started the day before which they said was no problem. Second day is usually my heaviest. I went in with a full pad, my procedure was around 1pm. 

But ever since I have had almost NOTHING in my pads. Not even the coffee ground stuff they mentioned. 

I was itchy and a bit sore at the vaginal entrance last night before bed so I got a mirror to have a look and noticed I could see all this dry brown stuff in there. Ok I thought, that’s just the antibacterial stuff they put in there, which will come out soon. 

But nothing overnight. I’ve been up walking around, had a little dance, doing things and still absolutely nothing has come out. So now I’m worried it’s gotten blocked up?  Like where is all my period blood going?

But I’ve been hearing a lot about ground coffee, so I’m curious. For context, I don’t drink milk in coffee, so lattes and cappuccinos aren’t my main priority. 

What kind of equipment and beans would I need to make a proper cup of black coffee?

Another thing, I’m lazy asf. Instant coffee takes two minutes and that’s perfect. I’m not sure if switching to ground coffee is worth the effort, with grinding beans, using different equipment and all that. But that's more of a question for me than you guys? What's so good about it. Like I've tried coffee from conventional coffee shops and I kinda like my instant coffee better. ",2,1764033823.0,pakcoffee,0,1.0,False

[Get Out of the Robot...](https://www.noplotonlylore.com/one-page-rpgs/get-out-of-the-robot-a-one-page-rpg-about-the-families-of-child-soldiers-in-an-intergalactic-war)

My son just turned fifteen. His older sister d… Died. When she was his age. Three years ago, now. And it’s really hard to not compare them. He has her laugh. Her mannerisms. He looks so much like his mother just like she did. And he’s starting to drift away from me the same way she did. And like, I get it. That’s supposed to happen, right? They’re supposed to get their own friends and start to assert their independence, all of that. So I’m trying really hard to let him have the space he needs for that, but every time he’s out late, I start to run through the scenarios, sizing up his friends, looking for signs he’s going down the same path his sister did. And then… Then last night I found it. Just sitting on his dresser drawer out in the open, as if it isn’t the exact thing that… That KILLED his mother and his sister. And I just… I can’t even look at him. I can’t be near him. I’ve… I’ve never hurt my kids, but in that moment I wanted to just… I wanted to HIT him. To hit ANYTHING so that I can get some of the… the pain. The pain out of my chest and into something else. So I just get in my car and drive for a while. And before I even know where I’m going, I’m at her school. Or what’s left of it. And I know. I’m staring at that thing that attacked us, the graveyard for so many of our children, and I know it’s going to end the same way. The only way it ever ends. He’s going to die in this stupid, endless war…

Get Out of the Robot isn’t a game about child soldiers recruited to fight an intergalactic war in giant robots. It’s a game about the people who love them.

What I Like About This One: 

Somewhat similar mechanics to yesterday’s game insofar as the selection of a friend and a rival. Mechanically I love the idea of playing with real-life time limits. Part of me wanted to find a way to smash this into 22 minute episodes, but for a role-playing game that’s a SUPER tight deadline and it would need to be streamlined as hell to play. 

There’s something about the idea of a half-way-point where all hell breaks loose that’s so fun to me. You can play two completely different scenarios, but if you can tie them together through a theme or through characters, it has a lot of potential to become something beautiful.

I grew up secretly loving the Power Rangers. I wasn’t allowed to watch the show because it was so violent, which makes a lot of sense because my best friend and I used to pretend to kick the crap out of each-other with hockey sticks while pretending to be Rangers and I knew nothing about the show. But I always wondered what it was like to be the people on the sidelines, trying to survive weekly kaiju attacks and dealing with the fact that your kid might die in a robot fight. 

What I’d Do Differently Next Time:

Probably make it about robot fights actually? I also have this killer idea for a larger thing where the Power Rangers are a villainous organization, but that’s gonna need a lot more than one page to get out.

**Memory Transcription Subject:** Jammek, Anxious Skalgan

**Date: \[Standardized Human Time\]:** February 2, 2137

“I mean this looks right.” I sighed, staring at the holo-projection on Nalva’s tablet, “The mountains are all in the right place. The north shore of the lake looks right but…” I hesitated, eyeing the topographic map despondently, “The lake is too small. That and there’s a whole river missing that fed into it from the west. Otherwise, I guess it looks like Sunfire Lake.”

The Venlil across from me at the table looked up, her ears twitching excitedly, “What a positively… powerful name!” She bleated, “To think we Venlil used to name things like that! Can I ask what made the ancient Skalgans to name it so?” She inquired. I wagged my tail happily. Despite our rough beginning, Nalva had proven to be fascinated with her own heritage recently, despite her skittishness.

“Well,” I answered, eager to share, “They say that the town founders had fled from a famine in a nearby region. When they set off, it had been just before the night paw. When they crossed over the mountains, the sun was rising after the night paw, and they said the light of the sun reflecting off the lake was like the flames of Solgalik beckoning them.” The grey wooled woman’s amber colored eyes lit up at that.

“I still can’t believe Venlil were once like… that.” She gasped, her tail wagging intriguingly in response. Her reaction to my talk made me so excited about our trip. It gave me hope that I could help the Venlil reclaim their… well, their soul. It made me believe what Arthur had told me. That the Venlil weren’t a lost cause. That we could be strong again.

“Well, you were.” I assured her, “And you can be again.”

“I hope so.” She replied, looking up at me with her strange, nose-less face. “But I think you may have found your hometown, Jammek. The truth is, that lake used to be bigger, but a rockslide on the west side of the valley cut off the river there about two centuries ago. More importantly, there’s an archaeological site in the south side of the valley that might be what you’re looking for.” I perked up at that,my ears waggling eagerly. The movement made the golden chains attached to them jingle.

“Really?!?” I exclaimed, looking back down at the holoprojected map.

“Yup!” She exclaimed, “The nearest town is a way away from the lake now, but the archaeological dig site is right on what would have once been the lakeshore.”

“I can hardly believe it.” I answered, my enthusiasm tempered with a healthy dose of trepidation. Arthur seemed to think it would be a good idea for me to visit the former site of my hometown, and yet… why? There was nothing there for me. There were no statues waiting for me. No happy endings. Only the bitter knowledge that I had left my poor sister there to die alone and unmourned. I knew logically that it wasn’t my own choice to do so, but that did little to help me stomach the reality of it all. Malvi was gone, and I had no delusions about how she passed, no matter what Arthur tried to tell me. 

“Thanks for helping me with this.” I sighed, pulling myself out of my own depressing thoughts.

“My pleasure.” Nalva responded, giving me an assuring wag of her tail, “Honestly, I’m happy to help you. You’re a much more palatable ancestor than… Brim.”

“Talked much with him?” I laughed, letting out a loud whistle.

“I’ve tried to.” She replied with a defeated sigh, “He’s… difficult.”

“That’s one way to put it.” I huffed, remembering what brief interaction I’d had with him in the camp. His “Church of Light” mindset had basically convinced him that I was worth less than dirt thanks to nothing more than the color of my wool. Arthur had seemed disturbingly familiar with that kind of mindset when I explained it to him. I doubted Brim viewed Nalva much more favorably with her gray wool.

“Yeah…” She whistled, giving her tail a disapproving flick, “I’ve suggested not involving him in the press conference. I think we’ll just have you answer the media’s questions.”

“I don’t blame you.” I replied, whistling out a laugh, “The guy is about as subtle as a thundegore in an ipsom field.” Nalva paused, staring at me silently for a moment.

“You mentioned thundegores before.” She began at last, leaning in intently, “What exactly are… errr… were those? I’ve never heard anyone mention them before, and I’m quite positive it isn’t a species on V… Skalga.”

“Really? That’s a shame.” I whined, pinning my ears back, “I always thought they were such neat animals. The scientists in my time said they were the closest living species on the planet to us.” I paused, trying to picture one in my head in an attempt to describe it to her, “They were large. Much larger than a Skalgan. They didn’t walk upright like us. At least not entirely. They were hunched over and walked on all fours most of the time. They also had forepaws that weren’t nearly as dexterous as ours, with huge claws on them and extremely sharp teeth in the corners of their mouths. The creatures were mostly herbivorous, but ate meat whenever it was available.”

“I knew it!” Came an excited shout from behind me, making me jump in my seat, quickly swiveling to face the threat! Poor Nalva dived beneath the table in surprise. When I turned, however, all I found was an ecstatic-looking Arthur. “I kept picturing a Venlil gorilla, and I was right… well mostly.”

“Arthur…” I groaned, looking over at the cowering Venlil beside me, “Did you have to shout like that?” While I might have found modern Venlil’s over the top fear responses unnerving, I couldn’t help but pity them as well. I was beginning to see that it wasn’t their fault that they were this way. The human finally seemed to notice the other person in the room and bloomed in embarrassment.

“Oh… my bad.” He replied, “That novel of rules they gave me \*\*did\*\* warn me that I was going to have to keep my voice down.” My sweet goofball made his way over to the table, pulled out a chair and slowly sat himself down. I could see a hint of sadness on his face. “I apologize, Nalva. I’m not used to how skittish modern Venlil are.”

The woman finally extricated herself from the underside of the table, looking rather shaken as she sat in her seat once more.

“I… it’s fine Arthur.” She replied, “You would think that with as much time as I had spent around humans, I wouldn’t be startled so easily.”

“Hey, that’s why I’m going to Skalga in the first place.” I assured her, placing a reassuring paw on her shoulder, “I want the Venlil to take their heritage back. We’ll once again be the terrors those federation cud brains feared!” She flicked her ears in the positive at me.

“I would like that, I think.” She replied, a brief shadow passing over her own expression, “I don’t like being afraid all the time. I hate them for what they did to us. Nobody should have to be anxious and afraid their whole life. I want to be strong and brave… like you.”

“I’m not brave.” I responded honestly, my ears drooping, “I may not be as fearful as you, but I’m far from what someone would consider a ‘brave’ Skalgan.”

“I think you're braver than you think.” Arthur quickly interjected, putting a hand on my shoulder and flashing me a smile. Nalva let out a whine.

“That’s another thing I wanted to talk to you about.” She whimpered, switching her gaze between myself and Arthur, “It may be a good idea to not mention that you’ve taken a human as a mate when we get there.”

“What?!?” I shot back indignantly.

“While the Venlil in the cities are fairly used to humans and are pretty accommodating…” She trailed off for a minute, perhaps choosing her next words carefully, “The rural inhabitants of the planet aren’t used to humans and are a lot less… accepting. It may be a good idea to keep your relationship with the predator… err… human quiet.” She suggested timidly.

“I’m not going to be ashamed of being mates with Arthur.” I replied indignantly, looking over at my human. The human for his part, had a contemplative look on his face however, turning towards me with those bizarre, front-facing eyes.

“She might have a point, Jammy.” He sighed, though I could see the sadness in those expressive human eyes “I don’t want this trip to be harder on you than it has to be.”

“No.” I snorted, my nostrils flaring at the mere idea. “I won’t just hide us. Whatever comes afterwards, I accept but I’m not going to pretend. No more pretending…. Right?” My human looked at me blankly for a moment before letting out a sigh.

“Whatever your decision is Jammy, I’ll stand behind it.” Arthur replied, giving me another of those human smiles, “I just don’t want to have your people turn on you for dating a…. predator.” I took a moment to process that. I’d never heard Arthur use that phrase about himself. I knew what that meant to humans and was more than aware that it differed from the federation fueled ideology most of the rest of the galaxy had been fed.

“Never say that again.” I hissed, leaning over the table and grabbing my human in a hug. “I know what that phrase means to humans. You aren’t a predator! I don’t care what you have to eat.”

“But he is a predator.” Nalva bluntly interjected, “He has to eat meat. And 99% of Venlil Pr… Skalga will see it that way.” I turned towards her, at first feeling a burning anger at the suggestion that my sweet Arthur was a predator but slowly simmering away until I could really absorb what she was saying.

“No matter what I say, they’re going to think Arthur is a monster, aren’t they?” I sighed, finally catching on.

“Sort of, yes.” She replied without hesitation, “Those Venlil who haven’t been exposed to humans still have the federation instilled response to them, and even the most tolerant Venlil still use that term for humans.” I had to let out an angry snort at that. I hated that my species had been so neutered that we feared another sentient race, whatever their diet may be. Even knowing about the Arxur, I couldn’t believe we were \*\*THAT\*\* afraid. The Venlil of my time would have risen up in force against such a threat, not cowered away from it in bunkers.

“I hope this helps change that.” I said in exasperation.

“I do as well.” Nalva responded, “But the Gardens of Aafa weren’t built in a paw. I had to pull a lot of wool to get the government to agree to letting me take you outside the capital, so it’s best to try and not make too much of a disturbance. I phrased taking you across Skalga as a PR move for Governor Tarva. Maybe if the Venlil can see what they could become, it would encourage them to vote for her re-election.”

“So what exactly is in the itinerary for this little trip?” Arthur inquired, absentmindedly reaching one of his hands up and gently playing with the golden chain now attached to my ear. Nalva paused for a moment, eyeballing where the human was touching.

“I’ve been meaning to ask,” She responded nervously, pointing at my ear with her tail, “what in the stars compelled you to do that, Jammek?”

“The piercing?” I replied, flicking my ear as Arthur’s touch began to tickle, “I wanted Arthur to wear his earrings and he asked me to get mine done too. Honestly I kind of like how it looks.” The small woman gave a confused swish of her ears but seemed to let the subject go.

“Well, the plan for the trip is fairly simple.” She explained, grabbing her holopad and pulling up some notes, “When we arrive on Skalga, Governor Tarva will be there, giving a speech. We’ll get you folks into the hotel we’ll be using to house you for the first few days, and take some time to get you presentable for the cameras. After that, we have the press conference and that will cover the first day.” She paused for a moment, scrolling down through her notes.

“The next day will have the doctors performing the physical exams on the returning Skalgans. We have a pretty good idea of what changes the Farsul made to us, thanks to their extensive notes, but it would be good to have a hands-on, first person view of what an actual Skalgan should look like and a comparison to our own, modern biology. The exam will also include collecting genetic samples.” This was followed by another pause.

“Day three, we were hoping to take you around Dayside City and let the locals get a look at you. That, and expose you to a bit of what modern Venlil life is like. Mostly PR work really. That’s also the day that our Dr. would like to try and have Arthur take the empathy tests.”

“Speaking of that, I'm not sure if I can do it.” Arthur replied, “Dr. Bilon wasn’t exactly certain what the tests actually involved. I’ll probably need to get some better information from your doctor before I can say for sure that I can take it.”

“Perfectly understandable.” Nalva answered, “All I know for sure is that, aside from some minor emotional discomfort, none of the test subjects from the exchange program had any lasting effects from it.”

“That sounds promising.” I spoke up, reaching up with my tail and wrapping it around Arthur’s wrist, “I’d prefer my human stays in one piece, after all.” Arthur just chuckled and gave me a wink. That was another one of those human gestures I wish I could imitate. It was so damned hard to do though…

“Anyways,” Nalva pushed on, “After that we’ll take a shuttle to a spaceport a bit closer to the night side. From there, we’ll be driving to where your hometown was. It should only take a couple of days by car.”

“Heck yeah.” Arthur laughed, “Road trip!” I had no idea what he meant by that, but I assumed we would be following the roads. It didn’t make much sense to try and take a car out over rough terrain after all.

“That, and the couple of days it will take to get back to Dayside City should be enough time for the scientists to analyze the genetic material and compile their results.” Nalva finished, putting the pad down and looking back towards us with one eye, “Sound good?”

“Sounds fine to me.” I responded flatly, “I’m interested in seeing Skalga again, even if I may not want to stay there.”

With our little briefing concluded, Nalva stood up from the table to go. Before she did, however, she walked up to the front door, grabbing a small package she had brought in with her and bringing it back over to Arthur.

“Last thing,” She said, offering the box to the human, “While you aren’t \*\*legally\*\* required to do so, you are encouraged to wear a mask while on Skalga. Most Venlil are more at ease with humans by this point, but there is still the danger of an older or sick Venlil having a violent reaction to your face. We’d prefer to avoid heart failure if we can keep from it.”

Arthur reached out, grabbing the box and popping open the cardboard lid. Inside was a shiny, black mask. The front end of it was slightly extended, as if hinting that it was intended for someone with a longer face than a human. Arthur picked it up, examining it in his hands. Noticing a small button on one side he gave it a click.

Instantly the front of the mask lit up with softly colored LEDs that seemed to mimic a set of eyes. The eyes didn’t look quite human though and were faced way too far apart. In the center was what appeared to be a very crudely drawn mouth.

“It’s one of the latest designs.” Nalva suggested, “There are cameras on the inside that register your facial expressions and the mask will adjust the LEDs accordingly. We’ve found that most Venlil find it less unnerving than those basic, reflective visors that they gave to the refugees since they can, at least kind of, see your face. And if you need to eat,” She reached a paw out, poking at a small toggle near the bottom of the mask, “There is a spot you can press here that will fold up the bottom of the mask so you can get food into your mouth.”

Arthur didn’t speak, just looked at the mask silently for a moment, turning it this way and that as he examined it. 

“Kinda reminds me of Daft Punk… or maybe Deadmau5.” The human noted, making me blanch and Nalva straight up recoil in horror.

“It reminds you of a dead rodent?!?!” She gasped.

“Huh?” Arthur replied, looking up in surprise, “No. that was the name of a performing artist back in my time. Wore a big mask with LEDs all over it to look like a face. Weird name, I know but… no dead animals involved.”

The gray Venlil let out a sigh of relief at that, her puffed up wool seeming to go down.

“Right.” She sighed, “You humans and your naming conventions. Anyways, I have a lot of calls to make. You two make sure to pack anything you or the little Sivkit need tonight. The transport should be here in the… what was the word… morning! Right. Morning.” With that she gave a farewell swish of her tail and made her way out the door.

Arthur continued turning the mask over and over in his hands before switching off the display.

“They might have a heart-attack at the mere sight of me?” He mused, his voice clearly disappointed, “Damn…”

“I hate that you even need to wear something like that.” I grumbled, giving my tail a squeeze around his wrist, “Hopefully this trip can help change that.”

“You know,” My human answered with a laugh, “if I’d been given a cool mask like this a century ago, I would have loved it. It’s so damned neat. But now? Knowing that if I don’t wear it I might cause some poor old lady to die of terror just from looking at me… it kind of takes the fun out of it.”

I leaned over, resting my head on his shoulder. “I’ve been wondering about all that.” I spoke, gently pressing my head into him, “I know that Nalva said the Federation did a lot of brainwashing to the Venlil, but this feels like it goes \*\*WAY\*\* beyond that. Do you think they did something with the Venlil’s brains in addition to messing with their bodies?”

“It’s possible I guess.” Arthur said, leaning his own head down to nuzzle into mine, “Bastards didn’t seem to hold anything sacred. Makes me sick thinking what they could have done to humanity if they’d been able to cure us. What kind of monstrosity would we look like now? Not saying the Venlil are monsters mind you!” He added quickly, “Just…”

“I understand.” I assured him, looking up and giving his chin a gentle lick. I still wished he would try growing out that chin fluff of his. I really want to see what he’d look like with some Skalgan braiding in there…

“I think that’s it.” Arthur announced as he leaned down, zipping up the large duffle bag he’d used to store his artificial pelts and a few other supplies, “I made sure to pack Mixsel’s toothbrush and combs in with my things.”

“You humans certainly require a lot of supplies when you travel.” Izra mused from where she sat on the couch, gently petting Mixsel on the head.

“Agreed.” I added in, comparing that massive bag to the simple, green shoulder bag I was taking. I was silently glad that I didn’t need to lug around all those garments like Arthur did.

“Well we can’t all walk around in our birthday suit everywhere.” My human snickered, getting a room full of confused looks in reply. Nobody bothered to ask though. I think by this point we all just accepted that Arthur would sometimes say ludicrous things that nobody else understood. Solgalik above I’d even seen him say things that confused the other humans before.

Then came a knock at the door. Arthur stood up and made his way over, opening it to reveal a small herd of people outside. 

“Hey! Come on in!” He laughed, stepping aside and letting the group enter. Eva was the first to step through, rushing up and giving Arthur a big hug, followed by Frank. The man gave Arthur a clap on the shoulder before turning towards Mixsel and waving. The tiny Sivkit squeaked with joy, holding up Frank the stuffed Venlil to wave at him.

These two were followed by Islatta and Imel riding on her back. Onio was close behind, wearing another of those fluffy artificial pelts that resembled Venlil wool. With him I could see the two Tilfish, Triski and Iskit from next door. Veryn, the midnight scaled Arxur girl came stepping timidly in behind them, looking very nervous. Arthur reached out and gave her a reassuring pat on the shoulder and a smile. Then everyone’s face turned to watch as a final figure made their way into the room.

“Shuyi!” Arthur exclaimed, stepping forward to wrap his arms around the woman in a tight hug. Her face was a patch of bruises and several spots still had clearly visible stitches but the mass of swelling had finally subsided and it was at least recognizable as a face now.

“I just got home.” She announced, “They told me you were leaving for Skalga tomorrow so we all decided to come by and wish you a safe trip.”

“I’m glad I got to see you before we left.” Arthur replied, finally letting go of her and taking a step back. “Please, everyone have a seat.” He said, gesturing towards the couch. The herd made its way over, taking seats as Arthur gently closed the door behind them.

“Are you guys excited?” Islatta asked, lowering her head and letting Imel scamper down to go sit with Mixsel.

“Yeah.” I replied, “More than a little nervous too. I’ve seen some things on the internet about… exterminators.”

“Oh yeah.” Frank sighed, rubbing the back of his neck with one hand, “You fellas make sure to avoid that bunch while you’re there. Bunch of hardline Fed-heads with itchy trigger fingers and a flamethrower.”

“You’ve met them?” Shuyi asked in surprise.

“Got stationed on the Venlil’s planet for a little bit after the strike on The Cradle.” Frank explained, “I’d taken a bullet to the leg during the attack, so I got cycled away from the front lines.”

“I didn’t know you’d seen action.” Arthur remarked, clearly impressed.

“I saw \*\*that\*\* battle, yeah.” Frank answered, “Was going pretty well till the Arxur showed up to the party. Then everything went straight to shit.” I could see Veryn cringe noticeably at that, pulling into herself on the couch as though she was trying to make herself look smaller. Izra noticed as well, reaching a claw over and placing it on the girl’s shoulder. Frank looked over as well, flashing her a weak smile.

“Don’t worry.” He assured the young reptile, “Everyone knows that had nothing to do with you guys.”

“But back to these… exterminators?” Shuyi jumped in, “Are they seriously as bad as all the stuff I’ve read online? They actually… burn people alive?”

“If they get half a chance they will.” Arthur confirmed, “There’ve been more than a few bad run-ins between humans and them. Thankfully Tarva’s outlawed them from using flamethrowers on humans. Not that all of them are listening.”

Several faces turned to look worriedly at Arthur, myself included.

“Don’t worry.” He assured everyone, “I don’t plan to go starting any fights while we’re there.”

“And if they even think of pointing one of those flamethrowers at you,” I added in, “I’ll headbutt them into next paw.” Shuyi’s eyes lit up at that.

“That reminds me!” She laughed, putting a hand on Arthur’s knee, “I heard about you two!” My human began to bloom at that, an anxious look on his face. I could guess why already. The modern humans were perfectly accepting of our relationship but Arthur had made it very clear that humans from the past weren’t nearly as open minded and Shuyi was from decades even before Arthur.

“What do you think of that?” He asked timidly.

“I think it’s great!” She laughed, “I was always the open minded sort. It never sat right with me saying certain folks didn’t have the right to love who they want.” Arthur’s smile quickly returned at that statement. “I’m glad for both of you. That and I found out about Eva being your great great whatever.”

“I could have told him that!” Onio remarked with a laugh, “Even with my limited purview of the human form, it is without doubt that the two share a familial resemblance.”

“Suuuuure.” Iskit chittered, rolling his antennae in what I assumed to be something similar to when Arthur rolled his eyes.

“You two better bring me back a souvenir!” Eva chimed in with a laugh, “I’ve never got to go to an alien planet before.”

“Sure!” Arthur chuckled, giving me another one of those winks, “We’ll bring souvenirs back for everyone.” He looked over to Izra, giving her a quick nod, “Think they’ll have t-shirts in Arxur size?”

“I think they would die of terror on the spot if you even asked.” Frank snorted, shaking his head, “You gotta be careful about everything you say while you’re there.”

“I gathered as much from the dictionary length list of rules they gave me.” Arthur sighed, “It’s going to be hard to get used to.”

“Well, at least we’re only there for a couple of weeks.” I suggested.

“So what made you decide you wanted to apply for Earth citizenship instead of going home?” Shuyi inquired. I hesitated there, waiting a moment to reply as I compiled my thoughts.

“To be honest?” I answered, my ears splaying back as I tried my best to convey my thoughts, “I feel like I have more in common with humans than I do with modern Venlil. It’s not just the way they look. I could get past that. It’s the way they think.” I paused, looking over at Arthur, my sweet goofy human, “I could never imagine being afraid of humans. Sure you guys look goofy but… underneath all that you’re no different than a Venlil… well at least the Venlil I knew.”

“Thanks Mon Mouton.” Arthur responded sarcastically, “You think I look goofy?”

“You do look goofy.” Izra agreed, letting out the deep, bellowing noise that counted as laughter for her, “You should be glad he can look past that.”

“Oh hush!” Arthur cackled, sticking his tongue out at her.

“Hey!” Triski spoke up, “What say that since it’s your last day before leaving, we all watch a movie together? There’s a Terran movie I’ve been dying to watch.”

“That sounds fun.” Eva agreed, “What’s the movie?”

“It’s called the Wizard of Oz.” The Tilfish answered, rushing to pull her holopad out and connect it to the holoprojector. “I’ve been told it’s a classic!”

I scooted my way closer to Arthur, leaning my weight against him as the insectoid connected up and turned the film on. I felt Arthur’s hand reach down and begin to gently scritch into the bulky wool on my chest. I looked up at him, giving him another playful lick that he answered with a gentle kiss on my forehead. 

I was a little nervous for our trip, but if I had him beside me I knew everything would be ok. We’d get to Skalga and do our part to save my people. I felt a burning in my chest as he reached his free hand down and interlocked it with my paw. We could do this. Together.

The others had already left and Izra had carried a snoozing Mixsel off to bed before going herself. The movie had long since played out, and I’d switched the tv over to the news. Everything was still focused on informing the public of the Archive. I didn’t really need to watch that. I was already acutely aware of most of the things that were being reported on. Hell, I was living it.

I looked down at the slumbering Venlil on my lap. Jammy had passed out before the movie even ended and I didn’t have the heart to wake him, despite the fact I could feel one of my legs falling asleep. He felt so soft and warm just laying there on me. I ran a hand gently through the wool atop his head and smiled.

I was busy just admiring my sleeping boyfriend when I heard a ping come from my holopad on the coffee table. I leaned forward, picking the device up off the wooden surface, being careful not to wake my slumbering Venlil. I checked the message and realized it was from Nalva.

**""Hey Arthur! 〔○\*\*\^(∩\\\^)\*\*\\\]\\\_//”**

**“Hey.”** I replied, not sure what that jumble of symbols was supposed to mean.

**“I did that thing you were asking about. As I figured, it didn’t take long for a publisher to jump on it.”**

**“That’s great news! :)”** I typed back.

**“Yup! And with the influx of cheap, affordable paper thanks to you humans, physical books are starting to take off in popularity! I even gave it a read through myself. VERY interesting. Are sure it’s ready for print?”**

**“Yup. Jammy already made the changes I suggested. It should be ready to go!”**

**“Perfect! I’ve set up a bank account with Jammek’s name on it for the royalties when they start coming. The book will be going into print within a few days!”**

**“Thanks Nalva. I owe you one. I just hope he likes this surprise.”**

**“〔-****^((▪︎)****\^)\]\_// Don’t mention it!”**

I put the holopad down, giving my sweet Venlil’s head a few more gentle scratches, smiling as he squirmed in his sleep, pressing his head into my touch. I hoped he would be excited by my little surprise. I was worried Jammy’s self confidence wouldn’t let him release the book, and that would have been a downright crime. It was too good not to share! The whole universe should get to see my Jammy’s wonderful imagination.",29,1764033682.0,NatureofPredators,2,1.0,False

My wife (30F) and I (30M) are relocating to Denver next year from San Diego and looking to buy a home. I'll be working in the NW Highlands Ranch area (near 470) and my wife works remotely. We’ll be flying out to tour neighborhoods early next year but are hoping to narrow down our search first.

Our Priorities:

* Budget: $600,000 - $650,000.
* Housing Type: We prefer a single-family home but are open to townhomes/paired homes if they have a small fenced yard/patio for our dog. We aren't looking for a massive lot or square footage.
* Commute: I’d like to keep my commute under 25 minutes.
* Vibe: We are ready for a suburban feel but don't want to be totally isolated. We’d like to be within a 5-10 minute drive restaurants, coffee shops etc...

We’ve heard Littleton and Centennial might be good fits. Are there specific neighborhoods in those areas, or parts of Highlands Ranch itself, that fit a younger demographic without kids? Or any different areas to consider?

I know Latrobe is about 45 minutes of the way, but if you happen to be in town visiting family, or bored and willing to make the drive out, could you spare your time to come donate blood? I run a small nonprofit called Juno's Rockets in memory of my son, Juno, who passed away from cancer in 2023 at only 3 months of age. I will always be grateful to the strangers whose blood products gave us valuable time with him. I am in treatment for cancer myself (yeah, our family has had rotten luck...), and I can't donate blood, so coordinating a drive like this is the most meaningful way for me to give back and help other children like him.

So if you can spare the time and willing to drive, please come join us. Blood products are in high demand during the holidays in particular. Donating in my baby's memory would mean the world to me and my family!

**The important stuff:**  
🕙 **Friday, Nov 28 | 10am–3pm**  
📍 Holy Family Church Social Hall (Latrobe)  
🎁 **Each donor gets a $20 gift card**

1p5z745,https://i.redd.it/pbwyeaar0b3g1.jpeg,A start: MiniAlley Event 25,"Once upon a time, there was a Book Nook Pal who bought a kit for an event, knowing that they may not be able to finish it by the end. But the Book Nook Pal loved the design and wanted to support the event, so bought it anyway, telling themselves that it would be fine if the event came to an end and they hadn’t made much progress. 

The end of the event drew near, and the Book Nook Pal started to forget about it being “fine.” Stewing over not being farther along, the Book Nook Pal decided to take a walk to clear their head. Not paying attention to where they were going, they ended up in an alley downtown, and accidentally knocked into a chair occupied by an old woman shuffling a deck of cards, sitting outside a cafe. 

As the Book Nook Pal apologized, the old woman said, “You seem to have a lot on your mind. Buy me a coffee and a pastry and I’ll read your cards, then we’ll see if we can get to the bottom of your troubles.”

The Book Nook Pal disappeared into the cafe, coming out with the coffee and croissant and setting them on the table. The woman asked the Book Nook Pal to draw three cards, commenting that she was impressed that three cards, the coffee, and the pastry would fit on the table, as most tables in similar establishments were way smaller than they initially looked. 

“The first card is the 10 of Wands. This represents complications in the way of you accomplishing a task. These are not necessarily bad things, simply reality. Work, other projects and commitments… hmm, I see a beautiful little umbrella on the end of one of those wands. Lovely, really; maybe this means something to you? 

“The next card is the 6 of swords, representing these complications resolving— work and other projects finish— but also internal complications. You have finally learned to appreciate the process vs simply the final product, and accepted— to paraphrase the great philosopher Bob Ross— that there are way more happy accidents than mistakes. This all clears the way for you. 

“And finally, The World.  This represents achievement and successful completion. You will finish your task at the right time, and it will be lovely, just not yet.”

And that is why I am not any farther on my Mini Alley event build, but am absolutely including that tarot reading into the final product. The end. 🤪

I’ve been interested in penpaling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in the many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I’ve been fortunate enough to have people to exchange with, and I’d like to see if I can find that again.

I’m looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. I want to actually get to know my penpal. Location doesn’t matter as much, as who that person is defines whether I’d like to engage with them or not. I do have a preference for cultural exchange in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you’re my state or half the world away, it’s you, the person, I want to exchange with.

I'm interested in both a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items, and a digital e-mail exchange. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I want us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let’s become familiar with each other to make sure we’re a good fit. I'm open to an e-mail exchange more readily.

So, who am I exactly? And who are you?

I'm 35, male, and live in the US (ET time zone). Thoroughly introverted, but bold and open when the mood strikes and with those who can tap into that aspect of me. I’m designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation, hence the lure of elongated methods of communication.

Incremental exchange and a mutual creation is what I default to, but I've gone to the ends of the earth on a whim with the right person before. I adore abstract minds that get idiosyncrasy and whimsy. Compatibility is a strange thing, though, that feels most real when it’s too fluid to be defined. I sort of have a thing for making connections work that otherwise shouldn't.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young. I’m most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that a lack of limitation is highly limiting.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee. I’m always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies. I so probably have more I take for granted.

Let's chat and see where things go. Leave your hesitations and take the chance.",0,1764033192.0,penpalsover30,0,0.5,False

Mend the things im doing wrong, clearly i'm messing up my life, my academic career, ect. And taking a step back this sounds way more dramatic than it actually is? 

But I seemingly have wrecked my spiritual life, fell away from all religion,but now im trying to find religion and idk what i believe. or what im trying to believe? (or who)

I feel attatched to Abrahamism in general, vaguely, maybe out of some sort of familliarity or hope that somehow i can use it as an anchor to fix whatever im messing up with. 

I'm too indulgent in.. whatever, internet, sometimes sweets/coffee. And that turned into me not focusing well, indulging too much in socializing instead of focusing on my career, my future, ect. 

So yeah idk. just kinda went off balance?

Anyone else just feel a need for religon but entirely lost after step 0.1? Theres some step between 0 and 1 where i could just make my own thing for myself but that feels selfish, arrogant, wrong I guess.
