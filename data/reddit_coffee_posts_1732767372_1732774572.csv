Enchanted by the serene landscapes and tranquil atmosphere, he spent his days exploring the backwaters and the beaches. One afternoon, he wandered into a cozy caf√© by the sea, eager to relax.

As he sipped his coffee, a familiar face caught his attention. It was Nayan, his former school teacher, now running the caf√©. The years had changed her‚Äîshe looked more mature and independent. Rajeev approached her, and they instantly fell into a comfortable conversation, reminiscing about old school days.

Nayan, who had recently divorced, shared how she had left teaching to follow her passion for cooking. She spoke with a sense of calm and self-assurance, though there was a hint of loneliness in her eyes. Rajeev, moved by her story, shared his own experiences.

The connection between them grew deeper with every word exchanged, a spark igniting between the two. Nayan, sensing their growing bond, surprised Rajeev by offering him a place to stay at her home nearby, saying, ""It's quiet there, and you'd be more comfortable""

Iced coffee being my go to! Over the years I‚Äôve had to ask myself‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúDid I really drink my iced coffee that fast??‚Äù Sad to say, my coffee normally last for a few hours, smh. Well, with no way to prove it‚Ä¶ I naturally would disregard the question. However, recently especially during the holidays‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve became a latte person, pumpkin spice to be specific. The other day I go to grab my cup and I start to walk away.. but something doesn‚Äôt feel right. My Venti cup feels noticeably empty. I got to my car and contemplated. ‚ÄúDo I go back inside and ask for a grande to measure the amount of liquid that was in my cup?‚Äù I thought, ‚ÄúNeh! I‚Äôm sure they under fill and I don‚Äôt want to make a scene‚Ä¶‚Äù 

My commutes about 2 mins to get back home‚Ä¶ When I get home, I check for myself. Open the lid and lo and behold‚Ä¶ about two inches plus of liquid is missing from the cup‚Ä¶ 

I show my boyfriend.. I grabbed the lovely Grande size Christmas Starbucks cup that they gave me the day prior and poored the Venti liquid into the Grande and it DIDNT even fill the Liquid. I turned to my boyfriend in amazement !! Called the Starbucks let them know.. let‚Äôs just say, they were far less than concerned and said ‚ÄúOk.? Well come back.. We can make you another one.‚Äù

What if I couldn‚Äôt go back? Why should I have to my waste time and my money for their mistake? 

I didn‚Äôt go back. I thought maybe this way a one off? Maybe I was wrong for being concerned.. But what if I hadn‚Äôt noticed ? What if this kept happening ? You mean to tell me I‚Äôm paying almost $7/day to them to be ripping me off and giving me a Grande? How many other people is this happening to? How many millions of dollars are they making profit from saving on product?? 

Well‚Ä¶ as I avid Starbucks consumer would‚Ä¶ I went back for my coffee the next few mornings for my morning coffee. I attempted to make my own and let‚Äôs just say it wasn‚Äôt what I was hoping for. So Starbucks it was!


A few mornings later, I order a Grande latte. I head over to my same Starbucks location. 


I walk inside, go to grab my drink and sure enough. IT IS UNDERFILLED! (Previously, I had googled if Starbucks under fills their cups and it says they do. But only about a 1/2 in) 

I was right by the cash register when I opened the lid and the barista noticed and asked, ‚Äú Can I help you?‚Äù I showed her the cup and asked ‚ÄúIs it supposed to look like this? Filled this low?‚Äù Again it was close to two inches empty‚Ä¶. 

She stuttered with shock and said ‚Äú Well, there was whip cream but we‚Äôll just make you another one!‚Äù While grabbing my cup‚Ä¶. 

Again, I‚Äôm paying for my Grande now but getting a Tall. 

I understand under filling‚Ä¶ I understand adding whip and their being room in the cup once it evaporates. But plus or minus two inches??? 

I understand it‚Äôs my choice to spend my money there but what concerns me is how much this company is making scamming people out of their money, essentially by shorting them on product.

Colour, wash the pots, learn a language, put some music on and sing in the shower, dance, walk/run/jog, read, make a list of things you'd like to experience in life (like a bucket list) and smile knowing it's yours, have coffee with a friend, play your games, do absolutely anything you feel like doing in any given moment.

1h1pe90,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1h1pe90/for_everyone_with_leaky_gut/,For everyone with leaky gut,"After sifting through several personal accounts, I've compiled the ultimate insider's guide to leaky gut syndrome. Buckle up for some eye-opening insights!

**Common Symptoms That Scream ""Leaky Gut""**

\- Chronic digestive issues (bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation)

\- Unexplained skin problems (eczema, random rashes, acne)

\- Persistent fatigue that coffee can't fix (that's me!!!!)

\- Brain fog so thick you could cut it with a knife

\- Autoimmune-like symptoms (random inflammation, joint pain)

\- Mood swings and anxiety that seem to come out of nowhere

\- Food sensitivities that seemingly appeared overnight

**Lesser-Known Facts Most Doctors Won't Tell You**

\- Leaky gut isn't just a ""trendy diagnosis"" - it's a real physiological condition

\- Your gut microbiome is like a complex ecosystem that can go haywire

\- Stress is basically kryptonite for your intestinal lining

\- This condition can be a silent contributor to multiple chronic health issues

\- Not all probiotics are created equal - some are basically useless

**Most Common Treatment Approaches**

1. Diet Overhaul

\- Elimination diets (goodbye gluten, dairy, processed foods)

\- Anti-inflammatory food choices

\- Bone broth becomes your new best friend

2. Supplement Strategies

\- Probiotics (specifically multi-strain)

\- L-Glutamine

\- Zinc

\- Collagen

\- Digestive enzymes

\- Omega-3 fatty acids  
\- Ayurvedic supplements like :

* **Triphala**
* **Ashwagandha**
* **Turmeric**
* **Ghee (Clarified Butter)**
* **Aloe Vera**
* **Guduchi**
* **Licorice Root**
* **Fenugreek Seeds**
* **Cumin**
* **Shatavari**

1. Lifestyle Modifications

\- Stress management techniques

\- Quality sleep (8+ hours)

\- Regular exercise

\- Meditation and mindfulness

\- Reducing alcohol and processed sugar intake

**Unique Treatments People Swear By (but aren't mainstream)**

\- Ayurvedic herbal protocols

\- Intermittent fasting

\- Specific carbohydrate diet (SCD)

\- Extensive microbiome testing

\- Personalized supplement protocols

**What DEFINITELY Doesn't Work (According to Community Experiences)**

\- Quick-fix supplements

\- Ignoring root causes

\- Continuing with a pro-inflammatory diet

\- Expecting overnight miracles

\- Treating symptoms instead of underlying issues

Leaky gut may feel overwhelming, but with the right diet, lifestyle changes, and supplements, healing is possible. Remember, it‚Äôs a journey, not a race ‚Äî and every small step counts.

**I‚Äôd love to hear from you!** Have you experienced leaky gut symptoms or tried any treatments? What worked for you? Drop your thoughts or questions in the comments ‚Äî let‚Äôs support each other on this path to healing!",3,1732773852.0,Microbiome,0,1.0,False

i don't like coffee and its advised for me to not drink energy drinks since that could fuck up my heart (my adhd meds are already kinda fucking my heart so mixing both could be dangerous) so I'm wondering if its safe for me to drink gfuel?

Ofc the better solution is just to ask my doctor to increase my dosage but it's a lil complicated for me to get a higher dosage of my adhd meds.. so that's why im going with drinking caffeine, at least temporarily. ",1,1732773615.0,GFUEL,2,1.0,False

1h1pa5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1h1pa5t/my_ex_came_back_female_needing_male_perspective/,My ‚Äòex‚Äô came back - female needing male perspective ,"I say ‚Äòex‚Äô because we weren‚Äôt in a relationship. 

Last night, I got a text from someone I was seeing last year for about 5 months. For context:

We‚Äôd, stupidly, entered in to a casual relationship and things naturally got complicated. I caught quite strong feelings for this guy, but given our difference in religious beliefs, he was adamant that he wouldn‚Äôt allow himself to get close to me like that. It didn‚Äôt stop us from seeing each other every two or three days, again stupidly, and it meant that my feelings developed and got entangled with the intimacy we were sharing.

Last October, I went to abroad for 2 weeks and we agreed to use that 2 weeks to ‚Äòseparate‚Äô and not talk. When I was back we wouldn‚Äôt see each other again. Except, I landed on vacation and he messaged me for the whole 2 weeks I was there. When I got back, we met up again the very same day. That day when we met up, I essentially asked him what this was. Was this ever going to go anywhere. He said he had feelings for me and cared for me but couldn‚Äôt see passed the religious differences. We were intimate, and Iay on his chest and almost begged him to not let a good thing go. I cried, he cried, he told me he‚Äôd miss me, that he wanted me to still message him etc. we parted ways.

A week later, I dropped a text when the dust settled to see how he was as that conversation had been really emotional for the two of us. His response was cold. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy with how things ended, we weren‚Äôt in a relationship so I don‚Äôt have anything to get over‚Äô. I felt sucker punched, but I left him alone. 

A few months later, in a moment of vulnerability, I reached out again and he blocked me. I‚Äôve been blocked, as far as I know, since then. It‚Äôs been painful, I‚Äôve really missed having someone there so readily, someone to talk to all day, to be intimate with, to share time with. It took me ages to dull that ache for him. Before him, I hadn‚Äôt gotten this close to a man in about 6 years. Being able to be in my feminine energy around him, for him to be responsive and communicate openly and daily with me, not ‚Äòghost‚Äô - all the bare minimum, but it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve met someone who genuinely wants to give me their time, fully. 

Over the year, I poured my love in to myself. I trained at the gym, ate well, moved country and redesigned my whole life. I thought about him every single day, until about 3 weeks ago, when the thought of him didn‚Äôt niggle so much. 

Fast forward to last week. I noticed I was unblocked as he appeared on my suggested friends on instagram. I didn‚Äôt do anything about it, just left it. I started to feel like I was actually moving on from it. I didn‚Äôt feel inclined to reach out as he‚Äôd blocked me and he was the one who was adamant he couldn‚Äôt be with me. 

Last night, I woke up about 3am to a message he‚Äôd sent me. He‚Äôs in the UK so he‚Äôd sent it in the evening his time. He‚Äôd replied to a story I‚Äôd put out asking if any of my friends in London had a gym pass I could borrow for the 2 weeks I‚Äôm there, and he just replied ‚Äòyou can use mine‚Äô.

I hesitated, but against my better judgement I responded. I wanted to, I wanted to hear him say he‚Äôd made a mistake and he wanted to pursue me and nothing would stop us. Except he didn‚Äôt.

After tentatively responding and checking to see if he was drunk (he wasn‚Äôt), we got in to a very long conversation. He said he didn‚Äôt want to cause me upset or aggro or to antagonise me, he just wanted to check in on me. Turns out very soon after we separated, he found a girlfriend. An actual girlfriend, one he committed to. They‚Äôd broken up last month.

The gist of the conversation was that he didn‚Äôt miss me, he‚Äôd just thought of me from time to time and hoped that I was doing well as I ‚Äòdeserved‚Äô it. That I was always kind to him and he felt guilty about that. He wanted to cheer me on from afar. He then asked several times, which I declined, to meet up for a drink or coffee to catch up as ‚Äòold friends‚Äô.

As you can imagine, this has left me reeling.

In the silence after we went our separate ways,  I‚Äôd formed in my head that perhaps he had missed me, perhaps he‚Äôd come back and realise what we had developed. He himself had said to me he had feelings for me! Surely with time he‚Äôd see that it was worthy to fight for. 

Instead I now know that he moved on within weeks, in to a whole relationship. He‚Äôd committed to someone else, when he couldn‚Äôt to me. He‚Äôd been intimate and loving with someone else. Given this person everything I wanted. That he didn‚Äôt miss me, but instead I feel like he pitied me. That he was checking in as he was worried I hadn‚Äôt found my happiness, as he so put it.

I‚Äôve spent a year almost mourning the loss of a man that is the closest I‚Äôve been to a man in years, to now just be yanked back in to feeling like I wasn‚Äôt enough for him then, and I‚Äôm not enough for him now.

I feel sick to my stomach, anxious, and almost like my heart has broken again.

I don‚Äôt understand why he reached out just to ‚Äòcheck‚Äô on me and to make it clear that he doesn‚Äôt want what we had anymore. But I feel so much pain, rejection and this feeling that I‚Äôm just not worthy of a man‚Äôs full commitment to me. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve taken 10 steps back and I‚Äôm flailing under the weight that I‚Äôll never be enough for ANY man, no matter how much love and time I  put in to myself to heal. 

Over the last year, I‚Äôve had the tough love from friends. I don‚Äôt need that right now. I just need words of warmth and support - and I‚Äôd be so grateful for it too. ",2,1732773435.0,AskMenAdvice,6,1.0,False

Not the whole family gathering in the fancy dining room of my grandparents home. Not the good china like old families used to pass down. Not the array of real minced meat pies made with venison, mashed turnips out of the neighbor's huge garden, and pickled crab apples off the tree up the road. Not the sound of the grown-ups talking about serious things, while kids caught up with their cousins. Not jumping in leaves or sledding on the first snow. Not those memories. 

This is my Thanksgiving. I am alone today. The grown ups then are gone now, and the kids and cousins then are celebrating with their own families and in-laws, often in far off states, leaving me to hold onto the warm sweet memories of those past Thanksgivings. Even in remembering, I don't forget to be thankful- the coffee is hot, outside the air is chilly but in here the heat is warm and the cats are dosing. So I'll content myself with listening to voices of loved ones around a long ago dining table of memories.   ",1,1732773361.0,DailyFeels,0,1.0,False

Last time i got two comments, so here's what happens next hehe. (Sorry this is long)

  
You- ""Its okay. Im sure we'll figure something out.""

Narrator- They stare at you, uncertainty in their eyes. 

Stranger- How will.... you... help? What's....

Narrator- They Claw their hair in frustration.

Strange- It- hurts---- to- talk- We're- --- sorry.

Hero- I feel... terrible. How did this happen?

Contrarian- I'm not sure. Maybe.. we can... cut them free?

Hero- Wouldn't that kill them?

Narrator- It would, so go on. Slay them, right now! Things are weird enough already. Don't play along. This is all some...trick.

Contrarian- Look,  i love a good trick but this doesn't look like a silly reversible trick. 

You- ""Im sorry... i wanted to help you all?""

Contrarian- We were supposed to, but that's not what *we* wanted. Why do you think we chucked that knife out the window? We cant kill someone we don't know, Mr. murderous.

Narrator- ""Mr. murderous?"" You think i like murder? No! I just don't want the entire world to be dammed to oblivion. I'm telling you this one last time, *slay her. Now.*

Stranger- You- sorry? -You- help- us? But- how?

Narrator- You approach her. And wedge the knife out her left side. No- their left side. Hm. Looks like your not insane after all! Finish. The.  Job.

\> \[Free them\]

Hero- No, we're not slaying them!

Stranger- What-You--Do----

Narrator- The sound of cutting and tearing- wait... what are you... 

Hero- What did we do?

Contrarian- We helped them, duh!

Hero- Helped them?

Contrarian- Hey Mr. Murderous! Enlighten him. Go on now. Don't be shy!

Narrator- I hate all of you.. but i suppose i cant stall forever. You strike at the princess. Annoyingly, you dont aim for their heart, or.... hearts. You... free them. You... Cut them free of each other. You cut every tissue, every limb, with surgical precision. After what felt like eternity, you're done. Before you, stand the rotten fruits of your labor. 5 princesses, 5... world ending monsters.

Hero- Why do they look... like that?

Contrarian- Hey man, don't be rude.

Hero- No no.... like they are all smushed and... wrong. And... bloodied.. battered.

Contrarian- They look fine to me. Say, we have tea now? 

Narrator- Oh im sorry, you think this is tea time? You think we can all sit down and peacefully have tea?

Contrarian- You prefer coffee? I mean that's fine-

Narrator- Okay, im begging you now. END. THEM ALL. You still have the blade-

Contrarian- WOAH calm down! Looks like Mr. Murderous need's a fresh glass of lemonade. 

Sinister- AHHHHAHHAH YOU FELL FOR MY TRAP!

Sad- \*sniffle\* When will this end?

Gentle- You're a hero! Thank you! You saved us all!

Harsh- You messed us up in the first place. Stay away from us, freak!

Monotone-Thank you.

Contrarian- Whew... there really are 5 of her now huh.

Narrator- Oh wow. I didn't notice. Thanks for telling me.

Contrarian- You're welcome Mr. Murderous.

Narrator- Cracks appear in the floor... no... the floor's layered on top of each other. They split into five peices. 

Hero- What's going on?

Narrator- You don't have time to ponder as a piece of ""floor""  strikes you in the eye, blurring you're vision.

Contrarian- Ouch. Bad floor.

Narrator- Then another and another. Eventually, a large piece strikes your head, you hear 5 distinct voices, one in panic, one sobbing, one rambling, one speaking calmly and another laughing. You cant make out what they're saying.

Hero- It hurts.... did they do this?

Contrarian- The mean one did this. I think?

Narrator- You lose all sight and hearing. Everything goes dark and you die.

  
CHAPTER 3- The Unknown.

Narrator- You're on a path- no,... you're on a crossroad-

Paranoid- What is this place? Why is everything so... out of place... and ... the floor! Get. Away. From. The. Floor.

Hunted- The floor can't hurt us if we're quick. Lets climb a tree, it'll give a clear view of everything on this crossroad. It will help us get our angle.

Paranoid- No way! The floor includes the tree's roots... what if the tree yeets us? 

Broken- Does it matter which way we go? Everything is related to the floor... we cant escape the floor.

Contrarian- Is'nt this fun? The floor is lava! Hello all of you! And... hi, Mr. Murderous. Lemme guess, seasonal amnesia?

Narrator- The hell happened? Why are there so many of you?

Skeptic- The floor killed us. Well, it broke and after that a piece hit us in the eye. It was all too fast. 

Narrator - Last time?

Hero - Yep. Sounds right. This is our third time.

Narrator- No wonder everything's all out whack. Well, you better-

Smitten- Go to the cursed cabin and slay her? NO WE MUST RESCUE OUR BELOVED-

Broken- Oh please... they hate us. Why wouldn't they hate us? We're so indecisive and pathetic and-

Smitten- She does love us! Lets go! Lets rescue her once and for all! Lets have a happy ending!

Skeptic- You keep saying ""her"" even though there are 5 princesses now.

Smitten- The gentle one is our love, the others have unnecessarily pained her! We should rescue her and get out of here.

Paranoid- Oh please. We. Will. Die. If we spend another moment here! Lets go back. Lets go back the way we came, better to not engage with her.

Hunted- Lets climb a tree like a said, it will help us decide.

Hero- One problem. No trees.

Contrarian- Then what is that? That's obviously a tree.

Hero- That's a tower, genius.

Contrarian- Same thing.

Skeptic- I say we go that way, left. The place has overgrown trees, it must be hiding something that the others aren't! It feels correct.

Smitten- Lets go straight ahead! Our beloved must be there, waiting oh so patiently!

Broken- Right must be the way to go. It's so empty, just like us. We can go there and cry in peace. I feel.. drawn to that place.

Paranoid- Leave! GET OUT OF HERE. This is all so so wrong.

Hunted- Get on top of that tree- tower- whatever! Now!

Contrarian- Lets dig a hole. A big hole, and go straight down! HAH isn't that interesting? Lets go down and show this floor that it doesn't scare us!

Paranoid- Are you crazy?  
Contrarian - I guess.

Hero- Just do whatever. Please don't stand around for too long.

Narrator- Go anyway, as long as you slay her....

Hero- Them. They're s 5 now.

Narrator- \*sigh\* them, whatever. Just slay them all, don't leave any loose ends, get you're job done. 

  
Options-

  
\[Climb the tree-tower\]

\[Get outta here\]

\[Go left\]

\[Straight ahead\]

\[Go right\]

\[Dig a hole\]



Lets see what happens next.... heheh.

Also, how do you get over the embarrassment of snoring when in early stages of relationship? ","*If you feel like skipping the beginning, which I hope you read for clarity and my history, especially concerning advice with dating‚Ä¶ If you want to just skip that I will put in bold the info that is about the situation today*


started to gain weight in 2020 due to health issues. I am finally better and losing weight pretty quickly and doing well, In 2023 I gained so much , I was my heaviest. Since then I lost 30lb and then since september I‚Äôve lost an additional 25lb. Im going to continue to lose weight so that will help. But I also snored a bit my whole life. I‚Äôm not sure how bad it‚Äôs been , my whole life‚Ä¶. in 2023 my ex slept fine next to me. I also dated someone at the very end of 2023 and he never said anything about my snoring when I would spend the night, in fact he would want me to.

But then again‚Ä¶ twice in the past 3 years i‚Äôve had a one night stand and woke up to them sleeping in the living room. Early in this year I was super drunk and passed out after a date and he woke me bc up bc he had work early and I was snoring. 


So I dated my current boyfriend for about 4 dates in 2021.

At the time he was working in the mountains the hour away from my house, from 6am-8pm.

The first time he spent the night , I woke up to him gone bc he left in the middle of the night bc be couldnt sleep due to my snoring‚Ä¶. and he had work at 6am, was gonna leave at 5am.

At the time my mental health wasn‚Äôt bad and I just wasn‚Äôt a healed person like I was now. I was SOO extremely embarrassed and wished he just woke me up I didn‚Äôt understand why. The next day I had attitude about it and he said that he wasn‚Äôt okay with that attitude so it just fizzled out bc it was awkward. 

That was 2021. We reconnected this year in 2024. It‚Äôs been going amazing . I was super apologetic about that night and he wasn‚Äôt stressing about it at all, also he can tell i‚Äôve grown so much as a person. We have fallen in love with eachother and im pretty sure im gonna marry him, but it‚Äôs also pretty new. We reconnected in August. 

***If you jumped ahead start here:**

The reason that i‚Äôve gotten away with the snoring is that he works as a commercial fisherman in alaska for weeks ar a time. We talk and stay in touch. In the past months when he‚Äôs in town I‚Äôd leave in the middle of the night saying I can‚Äôt sleep. Or I just stayed up all night, but that only happened once. 

I am just SOO embarrassed! I used the snore app a few months ago and heard my snoring and omg I wanted to die i sounded like a tug boat. Last time we agreed I‚Äôd spend the night because he really wanted me to . I drank a bunch of coffee before the date, my plan was to stay up all night. 

Well we did have some drinks‚Ä¶ during our date I told him if I ever snored just wake me up bc I don‚Äôt want him to sit there listening to me. He knows how embarrassed I am about it bc when it happened in 2021 and when we talked about it this year I expressed how embarrassed I was . Then after our date before we went to bed I said I feel awake i‚Äôm gonna probably be awake (which I do have insomnia frequently). Well I PTFO. in the morning he told me i fell asleep instantly before him. In the morning I was like I hope I didn‚Äôt snore ! and he goes ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt snore, I snore‚Ä¶‚Äù then later he asked me If i slept well ‚Ä¶ Mayeb bc before I passed out I told him multiple times I wasn‚Äôt tired? I have a feeling he was lying to me about me not snoring bc when I‚Äôve recorded myself i snore like 40% of the fucking time and not always super loud but sometimes super loud. I AM SO EMBARSSED. I hope to god he was just drunk and didn‚Äôt hear it but then again in 2021 we also were drinking‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm afraid he just didn‚Äôt want me to be embarssed. He did seem sleepy he slept in later than me. I HATE THUS

well he‚Äôs coming to stay at my new place for two weeks. I have not had insomnia lately, I have a feeling i‚Äôll pass out , bc we also will be hiking. He‚Äôs staying for 2-3 days and I can‚Äôt handle it knowing he‚Äôs laying there hearing me snore which is so unattractive especially since i‚Äôm a little overweight. 

How do you deal with the embarrassment when dating? Is there anything I can buy under 60$ that will just stop it or reduce it greatly? Do mouth exercise really work or make a difference in two weeks if I do them twice a day? Should I just leave a jar of earplugs and just casually be like oh there‚Äôs those if I am loud and you can‚Äôt sleep‚Ä¶ 


I am so embarrassed by this. I am in love with this man and I know I‚Äôm his dream girl but the fact of him laying wide awake hearing me with my mouth wide open sounding like a tug boat over and over like that makes me want to never have a sleepover again. 


*also i do not have sleep apnea. I also am losing weight quickly I have 35 more pounds to go Ill probably be at my goal weight by end of spring. Especially in my new place i‚Äôm out in the woods on 100acres and will be working with animals and hiking a shit ton, super active. ",1,1732772556.0,snoring,3,1.0,False
1h1p1px,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/1h1p1px/my_ex_came_back_after_a_year_and_my_head_is/,My ‚Äòex‚Äô came back after a year and my head is frazzled - help!,"I say ‚Äòex‚Äô because we weren‚Äôt in a relationship. 

Last night, I got a text from someone I was seeing last year for about 5 months. For context:

We‚Äôd, stupidly, entered in to a casual relationship and things naturally got complicated. I caught quite strong feelings for this guy, but given our difference in religious beliefs, he was adamant that he wouldn‚Äôt allow himself to get close to me like that. It didn‚Äôt stop us from seeing each other every two or three days, again stupidly, and it meant that my feelings developed and got entangled with the intimacy we were sharing.

Last October, I went to abroad for 2 weeks and we agreed to use that 2 weeks to ‚Äòseparate‚Äô and not talk. When I was back we wouldn‚Äôt see each other again. Except, I landed on vacation and he messaged me for the whole 2 weeks I was there. When I got back, we met up again the very same day. That day when we met up, I essentially asked him what this was. Was this ever going to go anywhere. He said he had feelings for me and cared for me but couldn‚Äôt see passed the religious differences. We were intimate, and Iay on his chest and almost begged him to not let a good thing go. I cried, he cried, he told me he‚Äôd miss me, that he wanted me to still message him etc. we parted ways.

A week later, I dropped a text when the dust settled to see how he was as that conversation had been really emotional for the two of us. His response was cold. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy with how things ended, we weren‚Äôt in a relationship so I don‚Äôt have anything to get over‚Äô. I felt sucker punched, but I left him alone. 

A few months later, in a moment of vulnerability, I reached out again and he blocked me. I‚Äôve been blocked, as far as I know, since then. It‚Äôs been painful, I‚Äôve really missed having someone there so readily, someone to talk to all day, to be intimate with, to share time with. It took me ages to dull that ache for him. Before him, I hadn‚Äôt gotten this close to a man in about 6 years. Being able to be in my feminine energy around him, for him to be responsive and communicate openly and daily with me, not ‚Äòghost‚Äô - all the bare minimum, but it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve met someone who genuinely wants to give me their time, fully. 

Over the year, I poured my love in to myself. I trained at the gym, ate well, moved country and redesigned my whole life. I thought about him every single day, until about 3 weeks ago, when the thought of him didn‚Äôt niggle so much. 

Fast forward to last week. I noticed I was unblocked as he appeared on my suggested friends on instagram. I didn‚Äôt do anything about it, just left it. I started to feel like I was actually moving on from it. I didn‚Äôt feel inclined to reach out as he‚Äôd blocked me and he was the one who was adamant he couldn‚Äôt be with me. 

Last night, I woke up about 3am to a message he‚Äôd sent me. He‚Äôs in the UK so he‚Äôd sent it in the evening his time. He‚Äôd replied to a story I‚Äôd put out asking if any of my friends in London had a gym pass I could borrow for the 2 weeks I‚Äôm there, and he just replied ‚Äòyou can use mine‚Äô.

I hesitated, but against my better judgement I responded. I wanted to, I wanted to hear him say he‚Äôd made a mistake and he wanted to pursue me and nothing would stop us. Except he didn‚Äôt.

After tentatively responding and checking to see if he was drunk (he wasn‚Äôt), we got in to a very long conversation. He said he didn‚Äôt want to cause me upset or aggro or to antagonise me, he just wanted to check in on me. Turns out very soon after we separated, he found a girlfriend. An actual girlfriend, one he committed to. They‚Äôd broken up last month.

The gist of the conversation was that he didn‚Äôt miss me, he‚Äôd just thought of me from time to time and hoped that I was doing well as I ‚Äòdeserved‚Äô it. That I was always kind to him and he felt guilty about that. He wanted to cheer me on from afar. He then asked several times, which I declined, to meet up for a drink or coffee to catch up as ‚Äòold friends‚Äô.

As you can imagine, this has left me reeling.

In the silence after we went our separate ways,  I‚Äôd formed in my head that perhaps he had missed me, perhaps he‚Äôd come back and realise what we had developed. He himself had said to me he had feelings for me! Surely with time he‚Äôd see that it was worthy to fight for. 

Instead I now know that he moved on within weeks, in to a whole relationship. He‚Äôd committed to someone else, when he couldn‚Äôt to me. He‚Äôd been intimate and loving with someone else. Given this person everything I wanted. That he didn‚Äôt miss me, but instead I feel like he pitied me. That he was checking in as he was worried I hadn‚Äôt found my happiness, as he so put it.

I‚Äôve spent a year almost mourning the loss of a man that is the closest I‚Äôve been to a man in years, to now just be yanked back in to feeling like I wasn‚Äôt enough for him then, and I‚Äôm not enough for him now.

I feel sick to my stomach, anxious, and almost like my heart has broken again.

I don‚Äôt understand why he reached out just to ‚Äòcheck‚Äô on me and to make it clear that he doesn‚Äôt want what we had anymore. But I feel so much pain, rejection and this feeling that I‚Äôm just not worthy of a man‚Äôs full commitment to me. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve taken 10 steps back and I‚Äôm flailing under the weight that I‚Äôll never be enough for ANY man, no matter how much love and time I  put in to myself to heal. 

Over the last year, I‚Äôve had the tough love from friends. I don‚Äôt need that right now. I just need words of warmth and support - and I‚Äôd be so grateful for it too. ",1,1732772553.0,BreakUp,0,1.0,False

-short grounding / purification meditation 
-ask my highest vibe guides to protect me 
-set boundary that only info for the highest collective good enters my awareness (and/or boundary like: I am not available now because I am going to sleep)
-wear protective essential oils like rose oil 
-visualize barriers around myself like nested bubbles, thorns, etc.
-carry crystals with me

I am kind of at a loss because I am already checking all the boxes as far as I can tell, but I am having to repeat these steps all day long, especially if I leave my house, and I‚Äôm still having information enter that is not helpful, spirits trying to make mediumship contact, etc. it‚Äôs especially hard given my clairsentience, I almost cried at a restaurant yesterday because someone there was sad & had lost their brother, but I felt all their grief and sorrow firsthand.

I'm looking for a woman to chat with sometime around 6-8 am Eastern time to motivate me to get up earlier.

This may be deleted for specifying gender, but oh well. This is a longshot anyway. I'm a man who tends to have much better platonic relationships with women than I do other men. I'm also struggling to get up in the morning just because I feel like I have nothing to get up for (I'm not currently working) and it's negatively impacting my mood and motivation for the entire day.

If I have planned chat over coffee or something then I'll have to hold myself accountable and get up when I'm supposed to. We can chat about just about anything.

Some of my interests and knowledge bases are Genshin Impact (I'm very into discovering the lore in the game, as well as the math of making my own builds,) sustainability, the energy industry, animals in general, great apes as a special interest, learning about other cultures, retro gaming, interesting modern games that do something different/unique.

Of course I'm happy to talk about much more, and also willing to debate controversial topics as long as you can keep an open-mind to opposing points of view. You can add me on Discord at crimsondream24 if you're interested in having regular chats over coffee. (Note: not restricted to people in NA)",0,1732771735.0,GamerPals,1,0.33,False

I have owned and run a very small cafe/bakery in a small city in Canada for the past 6 years. I have a lot of passion for it, and feel semi-confident in my ability to run a good business and enjoy the benefits of being my own boss but have far from gotten wealthy and have lived the typical burnt out stressful small business owner life and definitely made a ton of mistakes too. 

I'm just curious how many folks would be at all interested in a short, part graphic novel/mildly autobiographical novel of my experience going form barista to pastry student, to farmer to university dropout to cafe owner.  (Throw in brain surgery, a dead mom, an IUD baby, messy-ish divorce, some town business drama  and several broken bones, all while deconstructing my Christian fundamentalism, discovering my queerness and neurodivergence in my thirties , and a tiktok romance.) 

l often get told by friends, customers or other people I meet and share my story with (and my therapist) that I should write a book. 

My partner is in the process of writing his own fantasy novel. My mom wrote her lifelong project book on her deathbed that my step father and aunt had published post/humously.

But I also very much feel completely ridiculous thinking anyone would be at all interested in my life, I don't think l'm all that special, and it feels a bit vain/overly self important. But l've also enjoyed books similar to that kind of genre (if anyone knows Relish; My Life in the Kitchen, by Lucy Knisley) . I just kind of end up going back and forth.üôÉ

Hi all

I've been a coffee lover for a while now , and I finally pulled rhe plug on a coffee machine: the Gaggia Classic E24. It will be my first semi :) 

After following a workshop, it was mentioned that a grinder is just as important if not more important than a good coffee machine.

Since I like the process of weighing each portion and lake different styles of coffee (Americano, latte, cappuccino, espresso and filter coffee), I thought it be best to get a single dose.

However, there seems to be so much out there that it gets overwhelming. My budget would be around 400 euros (I live in Belgium). What would be a recommendation if quietness and aesthetics are important, as well as decent at both - master of none kind of thing?",1,1732771281.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Yesterday, my male best friend (dad) asked if I could watch baby tonight. Mom called to verify about an hour ago. 

I genuinely enjoy watching the Baby and embellish on our adventures. For instance, we‚Äôve gone bull riding, skydiving, committed acts of vandalism, engaged in illegal street fights, recorded pure drama to post to social media, and random acts of arson (clearly embellished activities for a 6-month-old). 

Some actual stuff I enjoy doing with baby is painting. She makes beautiful art for Mom and Dad to hang. I‚Äôve done like her footprints and the date on a canvas she smeared paint to give it her personal touch. We watch trash TV and gossip about what we watch. Baby is very opinionated. Almost too opinionated. 

I love to spend time with her and let my friends know they can drop her off anytime and I‚Äôll gladly watch her. Sometimes, I go to their apartment and watch the baby there. 

I have been dubbed as baby‚Äôs auntie, and Dad has made it vocally clear, I‚Äôm family. 

I don‚Äôt charge, because I didn‚Äôt have anyone to help me when I gave birth, so I just want to take a burden of stress off them to go get loose. Dad insists on paying and leaves me money on my coffee table I don‚Äôt ask for. So, please, don‚Äôt think they take advantage of my kindness (because they‚Äôve already expressed they feel it might be one-sided since I watch baby so much, but I want to). I encourage them to take a Saturday or day before holiday off and go shoot pool. Or hang out with other adults. Nap. Or whatever they want to do. 

I feel I have a great bond with my new niece. She recognizes me, my voice, and I know little tricks to calm her crying (I go through the list of ‚Äúwhy is baby crying?‚Äù) I recently found she loves clapping. 

I just wonder if people feel a connection to the little ones (or big guys) they watch, or do you look at it like it‚Äôs just a job? ",3,1732769630.0,Babysitting,0,1.0,False

* Multiple super-speciality hospitals (Sai, Vivekanand, Cosmos, Kothiwal, Siddh, etc.)
* Hundreds of private nursing homes
* Expensive schools (CL Gupta, PMS, DPS, etc.)
* Coachings of major educators (PhysicsWallah, Aakash, Scholars Den, etc.)
* Private universities (TMU is among the best in entire UP, but there are MIT, IFTM as well)
* 5 Star Hotel (Holiday Regency)
* Multiple shopping malls (Reliance Smart Point, Wave, Vishal, etc.)
* Gas pipelines in all major colonies
* High-speed fiberline broadband cover across the city
* Apartments and Private Societies (Mansarovar, TDI City, Gaur Gracious, and many others)
* And now also an operational airport.... bhale chahe sirf ek city see connectivity hai abhi, lekin operational airport bhi hai ab. Dheere dheere karke agar chal niklaa toh aur city see bhi connect ho jayega.

I am not interested in becoming a super enthusiast and spends loads of money on coffee equipment but all I would love to know are some rough guidelines on how to make the best possible coffee out of it please? (Even better if they came from someone from the same machine so that can share tips on best settings etc).

Ideal Temperature 
Light or dark roast
Grams of ground coffee 
Extraction quantity 
Ideal extraction time 
Etc 

I expect questions like ‚Äúit depends how you like your coffee?‚Äù but I guess I am after a good standard creamy coffee which is well balanced to begin with.

Jason had just walked in from the office and I knew that I shouldn't be here. ‚ÄúHey babe,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwelcome home.‚Äù The words tasted bitter on my tongue. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm heading to the store,‚Äù I lied‚Ä¶ well, sort of. ‚ÄúI was planning to bake something tonight, but we‚Äôre running low on a few things. Need anything?‚Äù
I hoped he did. Desperately. I knew that if he didn‚Äôt, there was no way I‚Äôd be allowed any outside time. Interrupting my thoughts, he said, ‚ÄúYeah, you selfishly finished all our coffee this morning, remember?‚Äù
	My skin tensed. I hadn‚Äôt made a cup of coffee today. He was probably too drunk to remember drinking it‚Äîjust like he was too drunk to escort his mistress out the door last night‚Äîbut telling him that definitely wouldn‚Äôt help my case. With the slightest hint of sarcasm, I said, ‚ÄúNot a problem, I‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, and pick up some beer while you‚Äôre at it,‚Äù he snarled, sounding quite sober for a change. ‚ÄúMy drinking buddies are coming over at nine.‚Äù Great. I can‚Äôt wait to play nice and cater to those misogynistic lowlifes.
‚ÄúOf course. I‚Äôll be back soon,‚Äù I said, turning the knob to leave.
‚ÄúYou better be,‚Äù he threatened. ‚ÄúIf you aren‚Äôt home in the next three hours, you‚Äôll regret it.‚Äù
Chills ran down my spine. I knew he was serious. I have a strategically placed scar on my lower back to remind me just in case I ever forget.
‚ÄúOkay, you don‚Äôt have to worry about me, I‚Äôll be back.‚Äù And with that, I was out the door, free from my prison for the first time all week. Realistically, this would also be the only time I‚Äôm allowed to step back into reality.
Jason doesn‚Äôt let me drive the car. He says it would be too ‚Äòoverwhelming‚Äô for me, as if I‚Äôm as delicate as a glass ornament. But I know better; it‚Äôs just another one of his sick ways of treating me like a pet instead of a wife. And yet, disturbingly, I don‚Äôt mind.
I‚Äôve always loved nature and tried to get outdoors whenever possible. Jason knew that. Sometimes, I find myself wondering why he even allows me this small freedom. When the winter winds stopped blowing and the flowers started blooming, he used to take me on the cutest little picnics you've ever seen. He‚Äôd drive me to our special place; the park where we first met. 
I was sitting on one of the benches, taking a break after my 5k run when his dog came over and jumped on me, slobbering all over my face.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù he said, his face turning red.
‚ÄúNot a problem, a little slobber can‚Äôt top my post-workout crustiness,‚Äù I joked.
He chuckled. ‚ÄúWell then, I guess I‚Äôm not sorry. Caleb only licks the prettiest girls anyway. Take it as a compliment.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, if your dog thinks I‚Äôm pretty, I must be absolutely gorgeous,‚Äù I said in a playfully exaggerated voice.
That made him smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre funny, you know that? Mind if I get your number?‚Äù he asked, holding out his phone.

‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù I said, typing in the digits. ‚ÄúShoot me a text when I‚Äôm not all grimy. Who knows? Maybe we could hang out.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm counting on it. See you around‚Ä¶?‚Äù He hesitated. 
Uh-oh. We were getting along so well, what happened? ‚ÄúOh right. Names,‚Äù I said aloud. ‚ÄúRachel, and you?‚Äù
‚ÄúJason. It was nice meeting you!‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúLikewise,‚Äù I responded.
And just like that, our meet-cute was over.
I walked down the sidewalk, my mind replaying that happy memory of Jason‚Äîhis smile, the way he‚Äôd joked with me, the warmth in his voice. A sharp pang pierced my heart as I realized the Jason I once knew was long gone, and probably never coming back. My steps slowed as I sank deeper into the thought of him. I didn‚Äôt even notice how far I‚Äôd walked until I found myself standing at the store‚Äôs entrance, greeted by my favorite cashier.
I smiled at her, startled by how I‚Äôd almost made it there without noticing. It felt like I‚Äôd slipped into a dream, caught somewhere between the present and the past. But the illusion didn‚Äôt last. The buzz of the store‚Äôs flickering lights jerked me back to reality, harsh and unforgiving. This was it. This was my life. No matter how much I longed for something more, for the old Jason to return, I knew it was a wish I‚Äôd never see fulfilled.
I grabbed the baking ingredients and coffee grounds, then trudged to the alcohol aisle, feeling as broken as ever. The beeping of the cash register, the clinking of shopping carts‚Äîit all felt so distant, so smothering. I wanted to scream. But I didn‚Äôt.
Air. I needed air.
I knew I wasn‚Äôt supposed to, and that my husband would kill me if he ever found out, but I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I had to see her‚Äîmy best friend, my lifeline. My fingers trembled as I punched in her number. The phone rang three times before she finally picked up.
‚ÄúRachel? You know you can‚Äôt call me,‚Äù she said, her concern evident. ‚ÄúWhat Jason did to you last time, I‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúBecca, I know,‚Äù I said, cutting her off. ‚ÄúI need you, though. I‚Äôm at Liam‚Äôs shop, and my anxiety is eating me alive. You‚Äôre the one person who knows the truth, and the only person I feel safe with. I have to talk to someone who gets me.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send you an Uber. How much time did he give you?‚Äù
‚ÄúHe said three hours,‚Äù I said, quickly adding, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôve already been out for an hour and fifteen.‚Äù
‚ÄúShoot,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a lot of time, but your driver will be outside in three minutes.‚Äù
‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSee you soon.‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù she said, her tone softening. ‚ÄúOh, and don‚Äôt forget to breathe.‚Äù She always knew how to lighten even the heaviest moments.
‚ÄúI hate you,‚Äù I teased in a sing-song voice.
‚ÄúLove you!‚Äù she replied before hanging up.
What felt like an eternity was really only a ten-minute drive, memories of the night prior flooding back to me.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre useless,‚Äù Jason had spat, his words slurred from the liquor. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know why I bother keeping you around.‚Äù
I‚Äôd frozen, my heart pounding in my chest. Gathering every ounce of courage I had left, I confronted him. ‚ÄúDo you even hear yourself? How can you say that to me?‚Äù
Jason‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say anything. Stop making things up, Rachel.‚Äù
I could still hear the venom in his voice, even as I sat in the back of the Uber.
By the time I was seated on Becca‚Äôs worn couch‚Äîthe one she‚Äôd had since college‚Äîmy emotions began to spill over like a busted dam.
‚ÄúWhen I confronted him, he denied he‚Äôd ever said it,‚Äù I choked out in a sob, my hands trembling as I clung to the cushion beside me. ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt take it anymore.‚Äù
Becca scooted closer, wrapping an arm around my shoulders. ‚ÄúRachel, you don‚Äôt have to do this alone. I‚Äôm always here for you. You know that, right?‚Äù
I nodded, tears streaming down my face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my favorite person,‚Äù I said through shaky breaths. ‚ÄúWe share everything with each other‚Äîalways. You‚Äôre the only one who knows all of it.‚Äù My voice broke as I admitted, ‚ÄúYou warned me about him. When I first started dating Jason, you saw the red flags. But I was too lovestruck to believe they could be true.‚Äù
Her face softened, her eyes growing teary. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to be right, Rach. I just wanted you to be happy.‚Äù
For a moment, I was lost in the memories‚Äîthe way Jason had held me the night he proposed, his laugh when we‚Äôd danced in the rain on our honeymoon, the dinners by candlelight, the way he held my hand at every chance, the plans we made for the future. He‚Äôd tell me how he couldn‚Äôt wait to be a father, how we‚Äôd have a big family and a house full of laughter. For a while, I believed in that vision. I believed in him. He was so thoughtful, always asking how I was feeling, always seeming so invested in my happiness. ‚ÄúThis is the man I want to grow old with,‚Äù I thought. I couldn‚Äôt imagine my life without him.
But somewhere along the way, that gentle sweetness turned sharp. His laughter became a weapon, his questions always those of accusation. Now, it‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt see me at all. I‚Äôm no longer someone he loves or cares for, but something he can manipulate, control, even hurt when it suits him. I feel invisible, hollow, like I‚Äôm just an extension of his world with no thoughts or feelings of my own. My words are always wrong, my actions always in question. It‚Äôs as though I don‚Äôt exist except as the person he wants me to be‚Äîand even then, it‚Äôs never enough.
‚ÄúI loved him so much,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI still do. That‚Äôs the worst part.‚Äù
Becca‚Äôs voice was firm but gentle. ‚ÄúRachel, love shouldn‚Äôt hurt. Not like this. It‚Äôs time to leave him.‚Äù
My heart dropped, terror taking over me. I shook my head furiously. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù I said, my voice rising. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible. Where would I go? What would I do? He‚Äôll find me, Becca! He‚Äôll find me, and then‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúRachel,‚Äù she interrupted, gripping my hands tightly. ‚ÄúListen to me. You‚Äôre not alone. We‚Äôll figure it out together. We‚Äôll keep you safe. But you can‚Äôt keep living like this. You deserve better.‚Äù
I stared at her, tears blurring my vision. Deep down, I knew she was right. But the thought of leaving Jason, of facing the unknown, terrified me more than the life I was living now. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it. I‚Äôm not strong like Becca thinks I must be. It would destroy her to know that I won‚Äôt, that it will never happen, but I just don‚Äôt have what it takes.
‚ÄúOkay, Becca,‚Äù I said, my voice breaking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try. We‚Äôll try together. But I have to go now. My time‚Äôs almost up, and I still have a thirty-minute walk home.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes!‚Äù she exclaimed, relief flooding her face. Her grip tightened, as if she were trying to keep me with her forever. ‚ÄúThank God.‚Äù
‚ÄúThanks. See you soon.‚Äù But I wouldn't see her soon. I was never coming back.
‚ÄúUgh, I miss you already,‚Äù she said innocently, not realizing how powerful her words were. ‚ÄúAnd Rachel?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù I paused, forcing a smile.
‚ÄúStay safe.‚Äù
When I got home, Jason was sprawled out across the couch, covered in his own filth; sweat, grime, and God knows what else. Disgusting.
I couldn't look at him, couldn't bear the thought of another second in this suffocating, twisted life. He had ruined everything. He was everything I had come to hate.
I went to the safe, my hands shaking as I pulled out the gun‚ÄîJason‚Äôs gun, the one he bought to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù me. I stood there, tears silently streaming down my face, staring at it. This was it. My chance to finally end it all.
With a shaky breath, I aimed the gun at Jason, his face blurry through my bitter tears. ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I choked out. With trembling hands, I turned the gun back toward myself. ‚ÄúBut you ruined me.‚Äù
I pulled the trigger, the bullet ripping through my skull.
And just like that, everything was settled. I was never enough; always too weak, always the screw-up. Well, now, I‚Äôm nothing. Almost as invisible as he made me feel all those years.
The End.

I was sitting on one of the benches, taking a break after my 5k run when his dog came over and jumped on me, slobbering all over my face.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù he said, his face turning red.
‚ÄúNot a problem, a little slobber can‚Äôt top my post-workout crustiness,‚Äù I joked.
He chuckled. ‚ÄúWell then, I guess I‚Äôm not sorry. Caleb only licks the prettiest girls anyway. Take it as a compliment.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, if your dog thinks I‚Äôm pretty, I must be absolutely gorgeous,‚Äù I said in a playfully exaggerated voice.
That made him smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre funny, you know that? Mind if I get your number?‚Äù he asked, holding out his phone.

‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù I said, typing in the digits. ‚ÄúShoot me a text when I‚Äôm not all grimy. Who knows? Maybe we could hang out.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm counting on it. See you around‚Ä¶?‚Äù He hesitated. 
Uh-oh. We were getting along so well, what happened? ‚ÄúOh right. Names,‚Äù I said aloud. ‚ÄúRachel, and you?‚Äù
‚ÄúJason. It was nice meeting you!‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúLikewise,‚Äù I responded.
And just like that, our meet-cute was over.
I walked down the sidewalk, my mind replaying that happy memory of Jason‚Äîhis smile, the way he‚Äôd joked with me, the warmth in his voice. A sharp pang pierced my heart as I realized the Jason I once knew was long gone, and probably never coming back. My steps slowed as I sank deeper into the thought of him. I didn‚Äôt even notice how far I‚Äôd walked until I found myself standing at the store‚Äôs entrance, greeted by my favorite cashier.
I smiled at her, startled by how I‚Äôd almost made it there without noticing. It felt like I‚Äôd slipped into a dream, caught somewhere between the present and the past. But the illusion didn‚Äôt last. The buzz of the store‚Äôs flickering lights jerked me back to reality, harsh and unforgiving. This was it. This was my life. No matter how much I longed for something more, for the old Jason to return, I knew it was a wish I‚Äôd never see fulfilled.
I grabbed the baking ingredients and coffee grounds, then trudged to the alcohol aisle, feeling as broken as ever. The beeping of the cash register, the clinking of shopping carts‚Äîit all felt so distant, so smothering. I wanted to scream. But I didn‚Äôt.
Air. I needed air.
I knew I wasn‚Äôt supposed to, and that my husband would kill me if he ever found out, but I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I had to see her‚Äîmy best friend, my lifeline. My fingers trembled as I punched in her number. The phone rang three times before she finally picked up.
‚ÄúRachel? You know you can‚Äôt call me,‚Äù she said, her concern evident. ‚ÄúWhat Jason did to you last time, I‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúBecca, I know,‚Äù I said, cutting her off. ‚ÄúI need you, though. I‚Äôm at Liam‚Äôs shop, and my anxiety is eating me alive. You‚Äôre the one person who knows the truth, and the only person I feel safe with. I have to talk to someone who gets me.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send you an Uber. How much time did he give you?‚Äù
‚ÄúHe said three hours,‚Äù I said, quickly adding, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôve already been out for an hour and fifteen.‚Äù
‚ÄúShoot,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a lot of time, but your driver will be outside in three minutes.‚Äù
‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSee you soon.‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù she said, her tone softening. ‚ÄúOh, and don‚Äôt forget to breathe.‚Äù She always knew how to lighten even the heaviest moments.
‚ÄúI hate you,‚Äù I teased in a sing-song voice.
‚ÄúLove you!‚Äù she replied before hanging up.
What felt like an eternity was really only a ten-minute drive, memories of the night prior flooding back to me.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre useless,‚Äù Jason had spat, his words slurred from the liquor. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know why I bother keeping you around.‚Äù
I‚Äôd frozen, my heart pounding in my chest. Gathering every ounce of courage I had left, I confronted him. ‚ÄúDo you even hear yourself? How can you say that to me?‚Äù
Jason‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say anything. Stop making things up, Rachel.‚Äù
I could still hear the venom in his voice, even as I sat in the back of the Uber.
By the time I was seated on Becca‚Äôs worn couch‚Äîthe one she‚Äôd had since college‚Äîmy emotions began to spill over like a busted dam.
‚ÄúWhen I confronted him, he denied he‚Äôd ever said it,‚Äù I choked out in a sob, my hands trembling as I clung to the cushion beside me. ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt take it anymore.‚Äù
Becca scooted closer, wrapping an arm around my shoulders. ‚ÄúRachel, you don‚Äôt have to do this alone. I‚Äôm always here for you. You know that, right?‚Äù
I nodded, tears streaming down my face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my favorite person,‚Äù I said through shaky breaths. ‚ÄúWe share everything with each other‚Äîalways. You‚Äôre the only one who knows all of it.‚Äù My voice broke as I admitted, ‚ÄúYou warned me about him. When I first started dating Jason, you saw the red flags. But I was too lovestruck to believe they could be true.‚Äù
Her face softened, her eyes growing teary. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to be right, Rach. I just wanted you to be happy.‚Äù
For a moment, I was lost in the memories‚Äîthe way Jason had held me the night he proposed, his laugh when we‚Äôd danced in the rain on our honeymoon, the dinners by candlelight, the way he held my hand at every chance, the plans we made for the future. He‚Äôd tell me how he couldn‚Äôt wait to be a father, how we‚Äôd have a big family and a house full of laughter. For a while, I believed in that vision. I believed in him. He was so thoughtful, always asking how I was feeling, always seeming so invested in my happiness. ‚ÄúThis is the man I want to grow old with,‚Äù I thought. I couldn‚Äôt imagine my life without him.
But somewhere along the way, that gentle sweetness turned sharp. His laughter became a weapon, his questions always those of accusation. Now, it‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt see me at all. I‚Äôm no longer someone he loves or cares for, but something he can manipulate, control, even hurt when it suits him. I feel invisible, hollow, like I‚Äôm just an extension of his world with no thoughts or feelings of my own. My words are always wrong, my actions always in question. It‚Äôs as though I don‚Äôt exist except as the person he wants me to be‚Äîand even then, it‚Äôs never enough.
‚ÄúI loved him so much,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI still do. That‚Äôs the worst part.‚Äù
Becca‚Äôs voice was firm but gentle. ‚ÄúRachel, love shouldn‚Äôt hurt. Not like this. It‚Äôs time to leave him.‚Äù
My heart dropped, terror taking over me. I shook my head furiously. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù I said, my voice rising. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible. Where would I go? What would I do? He‚Äôll find me, Becca! He‚Äôll find me, and then‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúRachel,‚Äù she interrupted, gripping my hands tightly. ‚ÄúListen to me. You‚Äôre not alone. We‚Äôll figure it out together. We‚Äôll keep you safe. But you can‚Äôt keep living like this. You deserve better.‚Äù
I stared at her, tears blurring my vision. Deep down, I knew she was right. But the thought of leaving Jason, of facing the unknown, terrified me more than the life I was living now. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it. I‚Äôm not strong like Becca thinks I must be. It would destroy her to know that I won‚Äôt, that it will never happen, but I just don‚Äôt have what it takes.
‚ÄúOkay, Becca,‚Äù I said, my voice breaking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try. We‚Äôll try together. But I have to go now. My time‚Äôs almost up, and I still have a thirty-minute walk home.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes!‚Äù she exclaimed, relief flooding her face. Her grip tightened, as if she were trying to keep me with her forever. ‚ÄúThank God.‚Äù
‚ÄúThanks. See you soon.‚Äù But I wouldn't see her soon. I was never coming back.
‚ÄúUgh, I miss you already,‚Äù she said innocently, not realizing how powerful her words were. ‚ÄúAnd Rachel?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù I paused, forcing a smile.
‚ÄúStay safe.‚Äù
When I got home, Jason was sprawled out across the couch, covered in his own filth; sweat, grime, and God knows what else. Disgusting.
I couldn't look at him, couldn't bear the thought of another second in this suffocating, twisted life. He had ruined everything. He was everything I had come to hate.
I went to the safe, my hands shaking as I pulled out the gun‚ÄîJason‚Äôs gun, the one he bought to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù me. I stood there, tears silently streaming down my face, staring at it. This was it. My chance to finally end it all.
With a shaky breath, I aimed the gun at Jason, his face blurry through my bitter tears. ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I choked out. With trembling hands, I turned the gun back toward myself. ‚ÄúBut you ruined me.‚Äù
I pulled the trigger, the bullet ripping through my skull.
And just like that, everything was settled. I was never enough; always too weak, always the screw-up. Well, now, I‚Äôm nothing. Almost as invisible as he made me feel all those years.
The End.
