I personally find it tough to brew coffee every day & consume it before/take it to work due to time constraints & I cannot have any at night cause I have super high caffeine sensitivity (ADHD). 

Does anyone else face a similar problem i.e. inability to brew coffee cause of lack of time every day? What do y'all do? Is there any place that sells GOOD specialty coffee in Mumbai that you can just grab & go & do most of you coffee connoisseurs prefer coffee made at home or outside (if made well of course). I think I would be super happy to find a place that knows their shit but on the other hand I think it'll be quite costly for daily consumption. 

Sorry I dont really know how this works & I am super clueless, a little direction would help. Thanks in advance :) ",0,1759313092.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.5,False

1nv43gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nv43gc/the_tupperware_takedown_that_taught_us_everything/,The Tupperware Takedown That Taught Us Everything,"I was lowkey ready to burn the apartment down over a plastic container. Not even a fancy one, just my go-to meal prep tupperware, currently crusted with what looked suspiciously like two-week-old pasta bake. It was sitting proudly, or rather, disgustingly, on the counter next to a stack of Liam‚Äôs unwashed coffee mugs. Ngl, my internal peace was hanging by a thread.

Living with Chloe and Liam in our city apartment was usually chill. Chloe, bless her organized heart, was our unofficial ""house manager"" ‚Äì always reminding us about the rent and recycling schedule. Liam, a graphic designer, was the creative free spirit who brought good vibes, but also sometimes, forgotten pizza boxes. I considered myself the middle ground, just trying to keep my head above the chaotic waters of shared living.

The tupperware was the last straw. I‚Äôd seen Chloe leave a passive-aggressive note on the fridge last week: ""Please wash communal items after use. This isn't a museum for dirty dishes."" Liam had just chuckled and written ""Good vibes only"" underneath it. I was about to add a very pointed comment about ""clean vibes only"" when I paused. What if we actually, like, talked?

That evening, I caught them both in the living room, scrolling through their phones. ""Hey, can we, um, talk about the kitchen situation for a sec?"" I started, trying to sound breezy but my heart was pounding. Chloe immediately straightened up, probably expecting me to complain about Liam. Liam just looked up, a bit startled.

""Look, I know we all get busy,"" I continued, ""but the kitchen's becoming a bit of a war zone. My favorite tupperware is currently a biohazard, and I can never find a clean mug. It's just... stressful. Prolly for all of us, tbh.""

Chloe nodded slowly. ""I've been feeling it too. The notes aren't working."" Liam, surprisingly, looked genuinely remorseful. ""Dude, I'm so sorry. I honestly don't even see it sometimes. I get in my zone.""

That's when we actually *talked*. We decided to implement a simple chore wheel for general cleaning, rotating weekly. For dishes, we agreed on a ""wash as you go"" rule. And the biggest game-changer? Designated shelves in the fridge and a small bin for ""communal items"" that needed washing. We even picked a specific day to clear out old leftovers. It wasn't rocket science, but it felt like a revelation.

A month later, the kitchen was still a bit messy sometimes, because, well, life. But the passive aggression was gone. We even had a ""community dinner"" night, making tacos together, laughing about the tupperware crisis. We realized it wasn't about perfect cleanliness, but about open communication and respect. That's so valid, right?

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

Like many of you, I'm obsessed with travel. But I've always been frustrated by the most time-consuming part: the planning. I'd spend countless hours with 50+ browser tabs open, trying to stitch together the perfect trip from a mess of blogs, maps, and review sites.

I knew there had to be a way to get the magic of a perfectly planned trip without the weeks of chaos. That's why I've been building Travique.

Our vision is simple:¬†**Experience more, plan less.**

Travique is an AI-native platform that acts as your personal travel intelligence. You tell it your unique ""travel DNA""‚Äîyour interests (are you a foodie, a history buff, an adventurer?), your ideal pace, your budget‚Äîand it builds a complete, day-by-day journey just for you.

We're trying to solve a few key problems:

* **Truly Bespoke Journeys:**¬†This isn't a template. The AI crafts a logical, personalized plan from scratch, ensuring your trip actually feels like yours.
* **Uncover Hidden Local Insights:**¬†We've built in a ""Local's Handbook"" feature, so on top of your main itinerary, you get a curated list of insider tips‚Äîthe best local coffee spot, a secret photo location, or a cultural etiquette tip that guidebooks miss.
* **A Seamless, All-in-One Experience:**¬†No more jumping between spreadsheets, documents, and map apps. Your entire plan, from the daily schedule to the interactive map, lives in one clean, beautiful interface.

We're putting the finishing touches on the platform and are planning to launch in the next few weeks. We've just opened up our waitlist, and we're giving everyone who signs up early access and a special launch day discount.

You can check out our landing page and join the waitlist here:¬†[**https://travique.co/**](https://travique.co/)

I'm here to answer any and all questions. I'd be incredibly grateful for any feedback from this community. What do you think of the concept? Is this a tool you would use for your next trip?

Most of my life I was the gamer kid who didn‚Äôt have many friends. I kinda became a shut-in ‚Äî most of my hobbies were indoors and solo. The few friends I do have are pretty similar to me: single, antisocial, and not very experienced when it comes to talking to people (especially the opposite sex).

Because of that, my social life is pretty much non-existent. I struggle a lot with starting and maintaining conversations with new people, especially face-to-face. Making connections is already hard enough for me, and on top of that I‚Äôve never enjoyed the bar/club scene.

I‚Äôd much rather grab coffee with friends, go out for dinner, or watch a movie. But meeting new people (male or otherwise) is tough in those settings. On top of that, being mildly autistic (not just self-diagnosed) means social/context clues often fly over my head. Approaching people feels daunting, and sometimes I come across as weird or awkward ‚Äî even when, in my head, I think everything‚Äôs fine.

Recently, I‚Äôve been trying to push myself to build hobbies outside my room and socialize more. I‚Äôm working at an open space startup incubator with people from different small companies. I try talking to them here and there, but I still struggle a lot. I also signed up for electric guitar/music lessons at a local school‚Ä¶ but most people there are kids, or parents bringing their kids, so not the best for making friends.

I‚Äôve also tried dating apps, but I either get no matches, or the rare ones I do get end up ghosting or putting in zero effort. Eventually the conversations die, and it just felt more toxic to my mental health than helpful.

You know that moment in the afternoon when your phone‚Äôs battery hits 20% and a low-power panic starts to set in? I was there just last week, right in the middle of a long train ride, desperately closing all my apps. I used to think the only solution was one of those bulky power banks, which just feels like carrying a brick in your bag.



It‚Äôs funny how we get used to these daily frustrations. I started noticing my phone‚Äôs battery was draining faster than my morning coffee cooled down, and I realized I was planning my day around power outlets. It felt less like I owned a device and more like I was in service to its battery life.



That‚Äôs when I started reading up on the iPhone 17. The most fascinating thing I learned, which has absolutely saved me, isn't just about a bigger battery. It‚Äôs the new A-series chip, which is so efficient it actually learns your usage patterns. It pre-loads your most-used apps in the background so the processor doesn‚Äôt have to work as hard when you open them, which is where a huge amount of phantom drain used to happen. It‚Äôs like the phone is quietly tidying up before you even walk in the room.



Now, I leave the house at 8 a.m. and, get this, I‚Äôm not even looking for a charger by 6 p.m. It‚Äôs a small kind of freedom, but it‚Äôs real. The phone just‚Ä¶ lasts. I finally feel like the device is working for me, not the other way around. Who knew a simple battery could change the rhythm of your whole day?

1nv3wxb,https://i.redd.it/6dyq70fn1hsf1.jpeg,Saxton Church - Heart breaking.,"While recently visiting Towton battlefield and the nearby Saxton church. I was shocked and saddened to see the medieval gravestones where being damaged by the church putting tables and chairs over them for what looked like community coffee mornings. You could actually see where sand was piling up and some lettering was scratched. It made me so angry, there was no contact details in the church for who to contact about this.

If.. IF they have to use the space they should be covered and protected, this is disgusting vandalism in my eyes and an utter lack of respect. What are you thoughts? This is the grave of Lord Percy I believe a Lancastrian who died on Palm Sunday at Towton 1461. It's historic and not replaceable.",4,1759312192.0,medieval,2,1.0,False

You know how my phone is always a dead weight in my pocket by dinnertime? I was just thinking about that the other day, trying to scan a loyalty card at the coffee shop with a sliver of battery left. It‚Äôs a specific kind of modern panic, isn't it?



That whole scene is exactly why I started paying attention to the rumors about the iPhone 17's battery. The talk is that Apple is finally focusing less on making the phone thinner and more on making it last. Apparently, they‚Äôre using a new stacked battery design, which is the same tech starting to appear in some electric vehicles. It basically fits more power into the same space without the risk of bulging.



If that‚Äôs true, it would be a game-changer. Imagine finishing a whole day of heavy use‚Äînavigation, photos, scrolling‚Äîand still having enough juice for a late-night podcast. It wouldn‚Äôt just be an upgrade; it would fundamentally change my relationship with the device, from something I constantly manage to something I can just use.



It‚Äôs funny, we get excited about cameras and screens, but honestly, a truly reliable battery feels like the most luxurious feature of all. I‚Äôd take that over a slightly brighter display any day.

I used Duolingo for a long time. It was fun at first, but after weeks of streaks and gamified exercises, I realized something important: I wasn‚Äôt ready for real-life conversations.

Here are the biggest problems I found with Duolingo:  
‚ùå Over-gamified: It became more about keeping a streak than actually learning  
‚ùå No real explanations: Grammar, context, and cultural nuance are missing, which makes progress shallow  
‚ùå Unrealistic sentences: ‚ÄúOwls drink coffee‚Äù might be funny, but it won‚Äôt help you at a doctor‚Äôs office or in a job interview  
‚ùå No real speaking practice: Repeating random phrases is not the same as role-playing real situations

That is why I built **Scenaria**. Instead of drills and streaks, Scenaria lets you **role-play real-life conversations** that actually matter:

* Job interviews and workplace conversations
* Doctor visits and medical discussions
* Dating and social interactions
* Banking, housing, and other everyday situations

And the best part is, **you can even create your own scenarios** to practice exactly what you need.

My goal with Scenaria is simple: Less streak anxiety, more real confidence. I want you to be able to walk into a doctor‚Äôs office, a job interview, or a first date and actually know what to say.

  
I would love for you to **give Scenaria a try** and tell me what you think. Your feedback and suggestions are what will help shape the future of this app and make it truly useful for learners everywhere.",1,1759312049.0,Scenaria,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm in my mid 20s and just started here earlier this year. It‚Äôs not toxic or anything, but there‚Äôs one coworker (she‚Äôs maybe mid 30s) who has this habit that honestly makes me uncomfortable. Every single time she sees me, whether it‚Äôs in the hallway, break room, or even just passing by, she comes in for a hug. Not a quick pat or handshake kind of thing, but a full body squeeze. Sometimes multiple times in a single day.

At first I didn‚Äôt say anything because I thought maybe it was just her personality and she‚Äôs being warm. But it‚Äôs gotten to a point where I start to dread running into her because I know she‚Äôs going to reach out and pull me in before I even have time to react. It feels awkward and honestly a little invasive, especially in a work environment where we‚Äôre supposed to be professional.

I‚Äôve tried doing the subtle things to avoid it. Keeping my hands full with coffee or folders, taking quick turns so I don‚Äôt cross her path, even putting up a polite smile and stepping back. But she always goes for it. Recently, she hugged me in front of a group of coworkers during a meeting break and I just froze because I felt so embarrassed.

Last week, she came up again with open arms and I finally just said ‚ÄúHey, can you not hug me all the time? I‚Äôm not really comfortable with it.‚Äù I said it calmly and not in a rude tone, just very straightforward. She kind of laughed it off like ‚ÄúOh come on, I‚Äôm a hugger‚Äù but I stood firm and said again, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd prefer if you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù She looked surprised and a little offended, then walked away.

Now I feel like the vibe at work is tense because she‚Äôs clearly avoiding me and I overheard her tell another coworker that I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo uptight.‚Äù A couple people said I should just let it slide because she doesn‚Äôt mean any harm, but honestly I don‚Äôt think I should have to let people hug me if I don‚Äôt want it, especially at work.

I keep second guessing myself though because it‚Äôs not like she was trying to harass me or anything malicious, it‚Äôs just her being over-friendly. But still, I felt really uncomfortable and I don‚Äôt think I should feel guilty for speaking up.

1nv3tk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1nv3tk7/chronic_constipation_all_of_a_sudden/,Chronic constipation all of a sudden,"I‚Äôm 20M and I‚Äôve never had GI disorders before. Around 4‚Äì5 months ago, one night, I ate too much at dinner, all because I was a bit obsessed with bulking. I started to feel sleepy and my stomach started to bloat. At that moment, I just thought it was temporary and decided to get some sleep. In the middle of the night, I woke up feeling like throwing up, but because I was so crazy about gaining weight, I resisted the feeling.

Well, after that incident my quality of life has been going downhill. At first, the symptoms were only bloating and constipation. The bloating was the most bothersome thing; it made me feel so heavy when walking, working out, and basically doing any physical activity. It wasn‚Äôt really an impediment in my daily life ‚Äî it was uncomfortable, but at some point bearable.

Nevertheless, with each passing day, my worries started growing more and more. I tried eating more fiber, taking laxatives, changing my diet, and drinking a lot of water, but nothing seemed to help. I was in a stalemate until I got a stomach infection from eating street food. My mom got it too, but mine was way worse, 100% because of this constipation issue. I remained sick for a week, feeling awful, and after the recovery my old symptoms seemed to have gotten worse. Now I have regular pain in the abdominal area and occasional nausea, fortunately no bleeding. I don‚Äôt even know what the triggers are. It‚Äôs so ambiguous ‚Äî sometimes it happens after eating something, but another day I can eat the same thing and be fine. Other times it happens after going to the bathroom. Some days none of this happens at all.

Things to add: I go to the bathroom 1‚Äì2 times a day but don‚Äôt feel relieved. I feel constantly bloated and it never goes away. Laxatives don‚Äôt seem to have much effect. Coffee used to make me poop instantly but does nothing now lol. Fiber constipates me more. Feeling hungry is weird to describe now because I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm feeling pain or hunger. I also have an urge to pee.

Something I forgot is that when I got sick I had ""diarrhea"", but I was literally ejecting liquid while being constipated. I don‚Äôt know if this can give a hint ‚Äî it seems almost impossible to have diarrhea, which I‚Äôve seen is a common symptom in many GI disorders, or the oscillation between constipation and diarrhea(dunno if this could give a hint).

For many reasons i could'nt consult a GI yet but im planning to. In the meantime I want to know if someone has experienced something similar or has any information that can help me, this shit sucks :\\\.

Ice Dragon

Race: Elemental

Height (While standing on all fours) - 7 meters

A cruel and cold-hearted creature, his lair is like a giant office space with ice soldiers working nonstop to create shards out of snow to not only provide Metelges with food, but to also be used to expand his own island. If a worker stops for even a second, they explode into a million pieces and get instantly replaced with another ice soldier, as for the follower‚Äôs remains, they become yet another source of food for the dragon.

Blatantly narcissistic, he enjoys being interviewed and more often than not will gladly accept paintings of himself to hang in his private room. One time Metelges was given an explicit drawing of himself and after staring at it for a full minute, he took it without saying anything.

Not only are this dragon's wings very sharp with their glass-like mainsails, the lub portion can also freeze anything it touches in the blink of an eye, so Metelges often tries to slam down his wings to cause large damage and make him enemies turn into ice statues.

Steklon is often exchanging foods with the ghost dragon Tekebake Kawakuro, sending him small polished ice pieces, while in exchange he gets notes, photos and coffee beans.
Kawakuro described the frosty delicacies as tasting ‚Äúblue‚Äù, while Metelges said that he enjoys the taste of pictures.

This dragon is rather embarrassed about his tail, finding it not imposing or grand at all, so calling it cute will only make Metelges steam out of anger, creating a thick fog which he can use against his opponents, as he is silent when walking on snow.

He‚Äôd had a thing for me in high school, I was aware, but nothing happened between us. He dropped out, I stayed to graduate, we lost touch. Fast-forward 16 years and he happens to find me at my job. He was with someone at the time. 2 years later, his name comes across my workplace again and we establish a relationship.¬†

When we first got together, he had a job. He quit the job shortly after (claiming a mental breakdown) and didn‚Äôt have another until 3 months later. He held that job for 5 months before switching to a different, lower-paying job, closer to home. He quit THAT job after another handful of months for ‚Äúsomething better‚Äù that fell through. He was unemployed for nearly a year. When he did get a new job, he kept that position for 6 months before switching to a different position, which he held for 3 months before getting fired for doing something stupid.

On top of that, his treatment of me has declined. At first, he‚Äôd wake up with me to have coffee, now he doesn‚Äôt even text me even though he‚Äôs playing games on his phone all day. He does nothing to help around the house. He‚Äôs gained almost 200lbs. He doesn‚Äôt take care of his hygiene.

I keep a daily journal and have gone through to highlight all the red flags he‚Äôs shown in the relationship from the start, and the evidence is staggering.

During a fight in April, I mentioned divorce. During a fight in July, I suggested it. I've asked for one in September. I wanted to ask outside a fight so he knew it was something I really wanted and not just ""in the heat of the moment."" I felt lighter after asking for one. Like, ripping off a band-aid; it hurt, but a healing hurt.

But, ""divorce is not an option."" He wants me to give him a chance to change. He‚Äôs asked for a list of our problems so that he can try to fix them. But why didn‚Äôt he ask for this in April? Why, all the sudden, does he want to try to change things NOW?

* **Ambience**: Calm lighting, neat layout, and a clean buffet line. It never felt crowded while we were there.
* **Seating + plugs:**¬†Lots of lounge chairs and dining tables,¬†**power outlets everywhere**, so easy to charge phone + laptop simultaneously.
* **Food quality:**¬†My tray was¬†**paneer sabji (tasty), steamed pulao, dal lasooni**; all hot and well-seasoned.¬†**Orange juice**was good too.
* **Service:**¬†Staff were attentive.¬†**Ask for cold drinks/coffee/tea**¬†and they‚Äôll bring it to your table.
* **Wi-Fi:**¬†**Decent speed**¬†\- handled email, Slack, and a couple of attachments without drama.

**Heads-up**

* **Kids‚Äô play area next door:**¬†If you‚Äôre ultra-sensitive to noise, pick seating deeper inside the lounge.
* **Timing limits:**¬†Many domestic lounges enforce \~2-hour stays; we stayed around¬†**two hours**¬†comfortably. (YMMV depending on access program.)

**Access 101 (helpful context):**

* Air India‚Äôs¬†**Maharaja Club Gold/Platinum**¬†members get lounge access (with¬†**guesting**¬†benefits when flying AI/Star Alliance). If you‚Äôre Gold and traveling with someone on the same AI/Star Alliance flight, you can typically bring¬†**one guest**.

1nv3ksy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1nv3ksy/anxiety_attacks_at_uni/,Anxiety attacks at uni,"(3rd year uni student ramble, sorry it went on a bit)

I get these panic attacks in social situations. Um like just the other day in my first psychology lecture I had a panic attack and just left all my stuff on the desk & left the room and got some air for an hour / half. 

And these panic attacks they have started to significantly affect my life. Like, I‚Äôve really been trying to be social this year and make some friends (I went to the psychology society meet up & started taking to people I sit next to in lectures and have plans of going to the poker society taster). But every time I think about going, I kind of self sabotage by having this fear of a panic attack. Like in one of my lectures the other day, I was very social and got the names of the guys I was sitting with, and we were joking and I was having genuine fun. But as soon as the lecture started & there was this silence I started to get into my head / my body went flush & I became super self-conscious and I kept shifting, and my body movements felt weird and robotic and uncomfortable and I kept thinking I need to get out of here. While telling myself come on you can do this. & eventually, after a fun ‚Äúget the body moving activity‚Äù involving eye contact & playing a game I think it was pretty obvious I was bugging out (I made awkward eye contact / avoided eye contact & stuttered failing completely,) I convinced my self going to the toilet for a breather would be okay. But once I got there I was just stun locked on my breathing for like 40 minutes. And I just couldn‚Äôt face going back in. (Like dude, all my shit was just sitting on the desk, phone / laptop etc for like 2 hours until the lecture was done). 

And that‚Äôs just a recent example. On Thursday last week I think I had a mini version of this in my 2nd lecture back, it wasn‚Äôt overwhelming but still enough to make me avoid talking to people I spoke to last year and Instead get the next train home. 

And these attacks have been going on now for about a year and a half now. 

It‚Äôs affecting my social life, like I‚Äôm really trying to make friends this year. I truly believe if I had a stable group of friends these attacks would go away but every time I meet a group of people that I enjoy spending time with I just fuck it up by getting in my head. 

And it‚Äôs so weird because, at times I‚Äôm like insanely confident. Overly so. Like I‚Äôll be waiting at the bus stop smiling at strangers and chopping it up you know like initiating the conversations. Or like making crazy eye contact with attractive people and smiling. But as soon as it gets to people on my course or in a more permanent position I.e I will see them again, I just get flustered & have these anxiety attacks. 

And it‚Äôs so bipolar. Sometimes I‚Äôll strut into lectures with my music on and I‚Äôll be active asking the people around me stuff (oftentimes irrelevant things like what question did he just ask or just for advice) and other times I‚Äôll come in flustered, and flush and jittery. And in these moments I recall I‚Äôm always so aware of my eyes or my mouth specifically. It feels like i can see a 3rd eye view of my face and i look kinda crazy in a way. Like my eyes aren‚Äôt comfortable, and my mouth feels uncomfortable in any position, and you can just see the anxiety im experiencing like it‚Äôs written on my face, and in my jittery movements and such. 

And like I‚Äôm seriously worried like this shit might affect my career. Like I really want to join the army or the police, it‚Äôs just a stable career that I can be proud of. You know it‚Äôs hands on, appeals to the masculine etc etc. but they won‚Äôt allow people with social anxiety in the army. And I‚Äôm here, freaking out in a lecture where all I have to do is look someone in the eye and clap every time they say 3. And I just can‚Äôt do it. Idk

Like I‚Äôm single too. Um I haven‚Äôt been with someone in like a long time. Obviously this shit affects my ability to date. So idk having someone and not feeling lonely a lot of the time I‚Äôm sure would help. But again, it‚Äôs like baby steps. I‚Äôm trying to build myself back up to being able to exist comfortably, in social interactions. 

In terms of my dissertation. Like I‚Äôm a little worried. Obviously I don‚Äôt want my group to think I‚Äôm an anxious weirdo & I don‚Äôt want to have a panic attack when I meet them. But also I want to be able to do my research studies and talk to patients with RA (rheumatoid arthritis) and things like this without fear of freaking out. 
Moreover, there is a ‚Äúgroup workshop‚Äù element in one of my courses that, should i fuck it up with the guys on my course, I might just never be able to stomach going back. 

Like nobody wants to be that guy that approaches new people and says, hey I have anxious panic attacks. Treat me nicely. Like immediately the relationship dynamic is fucked. People feel like a baby sitter & at times it can make the anxiety worse because it‚Äôs like, well now they‚Äôre on the look out for Mr anxiety. And it just makes minor attacks develop into larger ones. 

It‚Äôs just very frustrating. I mean, I used to be so confident. Like insanely confident. I was a theatre kid and I played main role characters, In my own time I was a lead singer of a band I made with my friends at the time. And I had a girlfriend which we dated for 4 years And I‚Äôd like crash out in lessons and be volatile at times & I would just never have thought I could turn out like this Later on.

And it‚Äôs just, it‚Äôs sad. I like really avoid reunions, because I don‚Äôt want anyone from my old life to see me again and think, wow he‚Äôs an anxious weirdo now. Like my ex of 4 years, I avoid anywhere possible where she could turn up. But like at the same time I feel like these people from my past. They like already know I‚Äôm having a shit time & have become an anxious mess.Like everything is so connected. So when I have panic attacks with my home friends or see someone I once knew at the gym and it goes horribly. I just think okay, now everyone that once knew me thinks I‚Äôm a weirdo. And my mum still speaks to my exes mum, and while I love her deeply she just tells everyone about my life. Like she talks to my exes mum & meets up for coffee and she knows I‚Äôm doing uni from home which doesn‚Äôt do me any favours (like socially this is just a red flag). 

And like, I know these people are probably out there, living their own lives not even thinking about me. Which in a way is sad but also I just I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on life. Like i want to be social, and have friends and go out and drink and date but every time things seem to go well i self sabotage / become insanely anxious. 

Honestly I just don‚Äôt want to feel anything. I want to go outside, and talk to someone and have zero thoughts in my head. Just pure flow state. Because when I‚Äôm comfortable and not thinking about stuff life is just so easy. And my true personality comes out. Like I play video games, I used to do it a lot but now I‚Äôve weened off a little. But like it‚Äôs just so comfortable talking to people online. Like they can‚Äôt see me for shit, and I‚Äôm confident and sociable and honestly a little annoying, like I‚Äôd say I talk too much. 

And I just want that to be my everyday. (Not video games but like everyday shit) Like I understand everyone experiences some degree of anxiety or whatever in new situations or first lectures back or whatever. But like, it‚Äôs just been soo long since I‚Äôve felt excited to see someone, or go to an event.

Like I‚Äôm pretty sure all of this started because I broke up with my ex. Like we dated for 4 years and she was my best friend basically. Like the only person I spoke to. 

And I like actually hate talking about this because it‚Äôs been so long. Like why the fuck aren‚Äôt you over this. It‚Äôs been 4 years now anyway, like almost longer than you dated for. Like fuck. 

But um. Yeah we had a mutual break up. And you might be thinking oh that shit wasn‚Äôt mutual. But no it actually was. And the relationship was amazing and not one sided and just like actually perfect. Um but like I‚Äôm terrible at talking to people over text. Like I don‚Äôt message people back or go on instagram like, when I do it‚Äôs very sporadic. And we both didn‚Äôt want to be those people that stayed together forever like, we knew we could but like come on. You‚Äôre like young. You should live while you can, and be single and experience life. 

So yeah we cut stuff off. But like this is where shit went downhill for me. Like I don‚Äôt blame her at all for this, I loved her to bits & she was so fucking amazing and I really don‚Äôt want to be that toxic guy that‚Äôs like ‚Äúfuck my ex she ruined my life‚Äù. Because she didn‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt blame her.

But um, being uprooted from that. It just fucked me up. Like I held on, I kept messaging her and shit and just my self respect went out the window. And from then on it‚Äôs just been downhill. But like if I had to pick a starting point, you know this is my psychology researcher thinking hat here. Yeah I‚Äôd say that moment was kind of pivotal. 

Moving on from that, like yeah I‚Äôm just. I want to know like. Is there a cure to this shit. Because, no body else is freaking out in lectures. And avoiding talking to their home friends at Christmas and shit. Or fucking spazzing out after being completely normal for like 10 minutes.

Like, I literally have to get fucking bottled drunk, wideraly ü§ì smashed. To talk to friends I‚Äôve had my whole life. 

Like I just want it to be easy like, here Sam take this pill. Now you won‚Äôt freak out anymore when taking to people. Oh and also, this shit Is off the record so enjoy your time in the army or wherever else you go. 

Um, I‚Äôm gunna talk to a well being advisor. And start better help as well.

Like. Idk. I‚Äôd love some advice. Or like sensei mind techniques or something like anything. I just want to know this shit goes away.

It‚Äôs been a complete game-changer for my daily rhythm.



This is all on the iPhone 17. I was skeptical about the battery life claims, but they weren't kidding. The real test was a weekend trip where I was using maps and taking photos constantly, and it just wouldn't quit. It‚Äôs the first phone that genuinely doesn‚Äôt give me that low-battery anxiety.



It got me curious about why it's so much better, so I fell down a rabbit hole. The biggest leap isn't just a bigger battery; it's the new chip that's incredibly efficient.

It‚Äôs like having a smart assistant for your battery, turning off lights in rooms you're not in.



Honestly, it feels less like an upgrade and more like they finally solved a problem we've all just accepted for years. I don't even pack a charging cable in my day bag anymore. It‚Äôs a small thing, but it‚Äôs one less thing to worry about, and that feels pretty great.

1nv3jyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFibroGuy/comments/1nv3jyb/using_kt_tape_for_hypermobility/,Using KT Tape for Hypermobility,"It is not uncommon to see those with hypermobility and EDS covered in an abundance of brightly coloured KT tape. Kinesio tape comes highly recommended for those with hypermobility, however, just like most modalities, there are those that find it helpful and those who do not. There is an abundance of claims when it comes to using KT tape, ranging from injury prevention to increased circulation. However, what does the research say about taping joints with KT tape when you are hypermobile?

This is the topic for today and boy is it a doozy!

# A short history of KT tape

Kinesio taping was first brought about by chiropractor Kenzo Kase, back in the mid-1970‚Äôs, when he¬†developed the original Kinesio Tape, which he called Kinesio Tex Classic.¬†The term ‚ÄúKinesio‚Äù is a shorthand for the word kinesiology, meaning ‚Äúthe study of movement‚Äù.

However, it‚Äôs important to note that this is not kinesiology, but rather good marketing. It could have easily been called a number of other things: Injury tape, Rehab tape, or Chiropractic tape. But that just doesn‚Äôt have the same ring to it, does it?

In 1980 Kenzo Kase established the ‚ÄúKase Chiropractic Institute‚Äù in Kojimachi, Tokyo, and officially founded The Kinesio Taping Method.

By 1985 a dedicated taping instructor programme had been developed, and by 1989 the national¬†Japanese volleyball team were using Kinesio Taping. Fast forward to 1997 and 7 of the major league baseball teams in America were using it.

At the 2012 Olympics, KT tape exploded! Many professional athletes were spotted on camera with colourful and elaborate designs, with even more elaborate reasons as to why they were wearing them.

At the Olympics there was a huge explosion in competition, with many new brands appearing also using the word ‚ÄòKinesio‚Äô in in the branding. Obviously, there are a few examples of cease and desist letters being sent in this time period, as Kase protected his trademark.

# Benefits of KT tape for those with Hypermobility and EDS

There are numerous claims when it comes to taping joints for those with hypermobility, and the list will probably surprise you;

* Lifts the skin, decompressing the layers of fascia, allowing for greater movement of lymphatic fluid which transports white blood cells throughout the body and removes waste products, cellular debris, and bacteria.
* Promotes the body‚Äôs natural healing processes
* Rehabilitation for oedema and swelling management
* Improvement of performance, rehabilitation of neurologic dysfunction, management of scars and postural training
* Relieve pain while supporting muscles, tendons, and ligaments
* Provides 24-hour pain relief
* Recovery, performance, injury prevention
* Support and alleviate skin tension
* Support and stabilise muscles
* Reduce inflammation and support muscles

However, bold claims require extraordinary evidence. Once you cut through all of the marketing and fancy claims, there are only really three points that may have any substance to them: pain relief, injury prevention, and increased performance.

These extreme claims have resulted in class action lawsuits and caused companies who market¬†Kinesiology Tape¬†to have to remarket and change their claims, as well as pay out considerable sums of money.

Under the terms of the KT Tape settlement, KT Health Holdings Inc paid¬†¬†**$1.75 million**¬†to resolve the deceptive marketing allegations. In addition to creating the settlement fund to reimburse customers, KT also agreed to change the way that tape is advertised, removing the label claims: ‚Äúit will keep you pain-free,‚Äù ‚Äúprevents injury‚Äù and ‚Äúprovides 24-hour pain relief per application.‚Äù

The¬†kinesiology tape packaging also changed to include a large bold disclaimer, to inform consumers that the¬†athletic tape is ‚Äúnot clinically proven for all injuries.‚Äù

Likewise,¬†**RockTape faced similar class action**¬†allegations that its tape doesn‚Äôt provide the advertised pain relief.¬†Unfortunately, sports medicine is far from evidence-based, with inventions such as theracanes and scraping tools having a tiny amount of research. However, taping has over 2000! So research isn‚Äôt exactly lacking in this area. But what does it say?

# The evidence for using KT when hypermobile

With so many claims out there for tape, it can be hard to separate fact from fiction, and placebo from actual mechanisms. As I mentioned before, once we take away the bogus claims, it leaves us with only three main points that may have any truth to them. If you are Hypermobile or have EDS, then I am going to assume that it‚Äôs more of the potential benefits to pain that you are most interested in.

The main issue with the current evidence on tape and hypermobility is that many of the research studies conducted conclude that KT tape may be effective, however, the quality of evidence (also known as grade) is insanely low. One example of this is a study in 2013(1) that concludes KT tape ‚Äúmay be effective in reducing pain during stair climbing activities‚Äù. However, the median effect of 0.5 on a pain scale from 0 ‚Äì 10, was lower than the threshold of clinical importance. Meaning, that the quality of evidence for this study was rated ‚Äúvery low quality‚Äù as it was a single trial with a very high risk of bias. Some authors even concluded that Kinesio Taping was effective when their data did not identify significant benefits!

There is an abundance of people with hypermobility that rely on KT tape every day, yet in the same breath, there are people that it simply does nothing for. Likewise, if you take a closer look, there are also people who get negative effects¬†from using tape, usually in the form of blisters, sensitivity, or burning, from the adhesive commonly used in¬†Kinesiology Tape.

Whilst there is an abundance of research into KT tape, the research conducted around taping hypermobile individuals, who are arguably the population that needs it the most, is rather disappointing. Whilst some studies do show that KT tape may have some benefits when it comes to pain and hypermobility, most of the studies are fairly poor, lacking in control groups, consisting of very small sample sizes, and with no to very little follow-up.

A study conducted in 2021(2), showed that Kinesiology taping may be effective for reducing shoulder pain and improving function in patients with EDS up to 48 hours post application. But, again, this was a sample size of eight females, no control group, and a possible time effect. Hopefully, as research grows, a larger study will be conducted with a control group, more participants, and over a larger time period.

Likewise, a far superior study conducted recently in 2021 (3), showed that 10 sessions of shoulder rehab, over a 6-week time frame, found no difference when KT tape was used. Both groups improved over time, in¬†[hypermobility symptoms](https://www.thefibroguy.com/blog/hypermobility-syndrome-symptoms/), range of motion, and functionality of the shoulder.

An interesting study showed that KT tape, when combined with foot strengthening exercises, compared to just strength exercises, was more effective at increasing navicular height: creating more of an arch. It was a decent sample size and could have been better controlled, but the main issue I have with this study is that it seems a little biased, directly quoting Kenzo Kase‚Äôs tape claims. However, it does give us a little food for thought. One of the exclusion criteria for this study though was no neuromuscular disorders, or more pertinent to hypermobility, no lower limb injuries.

The likelihood of someone using KT tape if they are hypermobile is because of recurring injuries and dislocations. So, how does this study compare to those who are injured and prone to dislocations? There is also the issue that one modality coupled with another, is pretty much always more effective than using a single modality alone.

An interesting study performed on recreational dancers¬†found that¬†Kinesio taping was fairly effective in eliminating sacroiliac joint pain, occurring in 13-25% of patients in the dance population (4). It‚Äôs a good idea to keep in mind, that people generally gravitate to activities at which they are naturally good at. This is one of the reasons why we find a higher prevalence of hypermobility amongst dancers, compared to say Rugby or other contact sports (5).

With research severely lacking in KT tape and hypermobility, I looked more towards the studies that would naturally include those with hypermobility, which is why these studies into dancers give us a little more insight into KT tape and hypermobility.¬†Having analysed numerous publications on the effectiveness of Kinesio taping amongst dancers and athletes, you could conclude that KT tapes proves to be ineffective when it comes to increasing muscle strength or improving proprioception of the joints. However, only if it is used by healthy individuals using moderate physical activity (6).

Studies of Kinesio taping under strenuous physical exercises, for healthy individuals, have demonstrated numerous positive effects of taping, such as improvement of articular proprioception and postural stability (both static and dynamic), relieving of muscle fatigue and enhancing their recovery, as well as a reduction in the severity of delayed-onset muscle soreness. Kinesio taping turned out to be exceptionally effective for patients with different acute and chronic injuries of the musculoskeletal system. It helped to restore impaired proprioception, stabilise joints, ease pain symptoms, and improve muscle strength. However, there still is one giant issue when it comes to tape and hypermobility; what is the actual mechanism that yields these results? It is incredibly hard to dive deep into this topic with so little specific research into hypermobility and tape.

Not only is this a hard topic to research, but when we factor in the poor quality evidence of the studies and potential bias, it‚Äôs easy to get a headache.

Research comes with many levels of evidence, and unfortunately, most of these studies aren‚Äôt great. However, I did find a study that sits firmly at the top of the hierarchy when it comes to evidence (7). In this beautifully done research, it concluded that KT tape, when used for a range of musculoskeletal conditions, has no benefit over sham taping/placebo and active comparison therapies. In essence, the benefit was too small to be clinically worthwhile, or the trials were of very low quality.

Regardless of the comparison used or the outcomes investigated, most research typically showed no significant difference in outcomes between groups, or a trivial effect in favour of Kinesio Taping (ie, small enough to not be considered clinically worthwhile). It seems that the growing use of Kinesio Taping is due to massive marketing campaigns (such as the ones used during the London 2012 Olympic Games) rather than high-quality, scientific evidence with clinically relevant outcomes.¬†

Therefore, current evidence does not support the use of Kinesio Taping for musculoskeletal conditions.

It is also possible that performance could potentially be increased, say through a combination of minor benefits. Alone they are hard to identify, but collectively they may be relevant.¬†So there you have it, the evidence for using KT tape is not very good!

# Why should you use KT tape if you are hypermobile?

The evidence shows us that KT Tape likey doesn‚Äôt do what it says it does, and any effects are likely a placebo or brought about by any number of biological, psychological, or social variables. But, some people with hypermobility like taping. It makes them feel better, experience less pain, and it makes them feel like their joints are more stable. If there was ever a reason to use tape, it‚Äôs not because of the crazy marketing, but of how it makes you feel.

So for the people who do seem to get pain relief from taping, why is this?

# KT Tape for hypermobile pain

Well, for those with Hypermobility, and especially those that sublux/dislocate, nociceptive pain can play a large part in their life, and this is where it gets interesting.

Nociception is where high threshold nerves that detect potentially dangerous stimuli, such as extremes in temperature, pressure, chemicals and stretch, inform your brain that something may be wrong. However, keep in mind that this is not a pain signal, because they do not exist. Let‚Äôs leave pain receptors in 1664 where they belong. However, for those with hypermobility and EDS, recurrent subluxations/dislocations, are going to cause a lot of nociception. In fact, this may even lead to nociplastic pain, wherein your nervous system changes how nociception works, making it more sensitive to keep you safe.

Let‚Äôs say you sublux your hypermobile ankle. Extreme stretching(more about¬†[hypermobility and stretching here](https://www.thefibroguy.com/blog/new-guide-hypermobility-part-3-stretching-truth/)) of the ligaments and tendons is likely to cause a nociceptive response. Your brain decided that because of the context of the situation and about 50 million other variables, producing pain to stop you from bearing weight on your ankle and damaging it further, is a very good call.

Your joint isn‚Äôt dislocated, however, it did go out and then straight back in‚Ä¶this is known as a subluxation (you probably already knew that if you‚Äôre hypermobile). Depending on the degree of subluxation/dislocation that occurs, nerves and blood vessels may be damaged, muscles and ligaments may tear or twinge, the joint may swell, compression of nerves may cause tingling, and inflammatory responses can be activated. ¬†Say hello to nociception!

Due to the subluxation, you have a local inflammatory response. Your nervous system is on high alert and it‚Äôs sending far more information to your brain than it normally does when it comes to your ankle. Your brain receives around 11 million bits of sensory information every second, so what is a little more if it keeps you safe.

Tape very likely acts as a competing input for those with hypermobility, helping to drown out nociception to some small degree. If you stub your toe on a coffee table, you‚Äôre likely going to produce nociceptive pain. The first thing you are going to do is to rub your toes sending competing information to your brain to drown it out. This is why the pain changes from that sudden, acute, and sharp pain, to a more manageable low-level throbbing pain. So, it‚Äôs not a far stretch to assume that it is likely the same mechanisms at work.

Likewise, we are human and as such we are incredibly tactile. We love to touch. In fact, it‚Äôs one of the very first things we learn as babies, as our mothers cuddle us and provide love. It‚Äôs also one of the very first associations we make as small children. We fall over, we scrape our knees, and mum makes it better with a kiss and cuddle. As humans, we often learn that when it comes to pain, sensory information helps. If you don‚Äôt believe me, then the next time you stub your toe, just don‚Äôt rub it and see how long you can stand. Touch and sensory information for humans is innate.

In the weird world of pain, there are many things that mediate and contribute to why someone experiences it. Likewise, there is also an abundance of factors that help to reduce it, and touch and sensory information is one of those things. Taping a joint does seem to give people have more ownership over it, becoming acutely more aware of joint positioning (well kind of), as well as being more conscious when it comes to moving the joint. After all, it is a lot harder to sublux a joint, if you are paying attention to it. Which coincidentally, is the main mechanism most hypermobility rehab, pilates, and yoga programmes use. The only issue here is that you can be absolutely fine whilst doing the exercise (because you are aware), however, once you finish and go about your day, pop, there goes your joint.

We have said it a million times here at The Fibro Guy, the way that other professionals go about hypermobility rehab is not right at the moment. Consciously being aware of your joints does not stabilise them outside of sessions, only slightly inside of sessions. If you take a look a¬†[some of our clients](https://www.thefibroguy.com/client-success-stories/), you will see that in a very short time frame their joints become stable outside of sessions not just inside, and this is largely because we work neurologically, and don‚Äôt stress conscious awareness.

# KT Tape doesn‚Äôt immobilise hypermobile joints

Probably one of the better reasons to choose KT tape if you are hypermobile or have Ehlers Danlos syndrome, over say a rock-hard support splint, is the effect that immobilising can have.

Immobilisation can lead to hypoxic and inflammatory conditions in the joint capsule, which can easily become an initiating factor for issues such as joint contractures, as well as sending constant nociceptive signals.

With a joint that is repeatedly dislocating, there is a fair chance that the person suffering is likely going to avoid using the joint, choosing to immobilise it. This, however, can lead to a vicious cycle of disuse and lack of nourishment to the joint. In immobilisation studies conducted over 32 weeks by binding the hind legs of rats:

* ¬†Immobilised cartilage had increased collagen content (scar tissue)
* Articular cartilage was thinner
* The severity of osteoarthritis increased as measured by Mankin scores
* The trabecular bone plate area (the spongy bone at the end of long bones,¬†like the thigh and shin bones) at the front and back of the shin showed bone loss, but not in the middle.
* Chondral vascular ingrowth was seen in the subchondral bone. This means that blood supply was increased to the bone as the cartilage and outer bone was dying.
* The centre of the knee joint was being fortified, as we see in the fact that bone loss was not seen in the centre of the top of the tibia bone.

Replacement of cartilage by bone may have been mediated by chondral vascularisation, suggesting irreversible changes. These findings stress the importance of weight-bearing and joint motion to maintain cartilage structure.

Not surprisingly, it has been shown that the more a specific joint is exercised, the stronger the bone-ligament and bone-tendon complexes become.¬†Exercise specifically helps strengthen the fibro-osseous junction, which is where the ligament/tendon and bone attach to each other, and which, incidentally, is the area where Prolotherapy (often recommended and praised by the hypermobile population) treatments are administered.

With KT tape providing some sensory tickling, as well as helping to support the joint, but not completely immobilise it, it does have the potential to be a lot healthier, given the above.

# KT tape for proprioception

So, a big reason why a lot of those with hypermobility and EDS use Kinesio taping, is because they feel that it adds to proprioception. Now I will preface this next section by saying here at The Fibro Guy, we do use tape occasionally, however, only ever in session, and we never make KT tape out to be more than it is. Tape can be helpful for some of our clients with issues like Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, to help cue them into positions where they aren‚Äôt causing compression. With that being said, it‚Äôs only ever added for a tiny boost to positioning and awareness. To be honest, it‚Äôs more like an addition to awareness, than actually increasing proprioception.

Research around proprioception and the use of KT tape in the hypermobile population, is again, unsurprisingly sparse!

An interesting study performed on those with¬†hemiplegia due to stroke, found a¬†difference in values before and after the tape was applied in the case of¬†left and right deviation whilst walking (8). Not a fantastic study, due to a lack of controls, too small of sample size, and the fact that¬†physiological and psychological factors were not considered relating to the subjects.

Many ankle studies show KT tape has no real significance when it comes to proprioception (9). Likewise, studies around the lower back and proprioception (10), yield the same results. One study looking at the effects of Kinesio taping of the knee on proprioception, balance, and functional performance in patients with anterior cruciate ligament rupture (ACLr) found some interesting results, in that¬†KT may have beneficial effects on proprioception, balance, and functional performance in people with ACLr, but it cannot completely compensate for the loss of proprioception. The application of KT during rehabilitation may be a good therapeutic option either before ACL reconstruction surgery or as a conservative treatment for ACLr. However, it‚Äôs not a great study when it comes to tape, for many of the reasons I‚Äôve already stated in the above paragraphs.

Then we have another study by a team of Italian researchers found that Kinesio Tape may help improve ankle stability for athletes with chronic ankle instability (11).

So, looking at the research, it looks like sometimes it may help slightly, other times it makes no difference at all, and there are 100,000 other variables that are likely involved, but unaccounted for.

Research always has limitations, and a large one is that a lot of these studies were performed with vision removed from the experiments. Vision is an important part of moving, as it works in conjunction with our cortical maps, to help us over through space and time. People, especially those with hypermobility and EDS, don‚Äôt walk through life with their eyes shut using just proprioception, they include visual data. Likewise, small sample sizes, some bias, and a whole host of other things, we end up with more questions than we first started with.

# Should you use KT Tape for hypermobility and EDS?

By looking at the research, we can see that something happens when we use KT tape. I mean it‚Äôs probably not the KT tape that‚Äôs responsible, but a whole host of other factors. But, the fact remains, that KT tape may make people more aware of their joints, but more importantly, it might help contribute to less pain, and that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs about isn‚Äôt it.

Tape isn‚Äôt particularly invasive, it‚Äôs not damaging (well sometimes, and I will get to that), and it makes some people feel better. Given all of that, if taping does help you, then you don‚Äôt really have anything to lose; just don‚Äôt go expecting miracles. I think that the use of tape in this context is fine. It‚Äôs a little like¬†stretching, a lot of the reasons people do it got debunked years ago. But, if it feels good and it helps, go for it.

So, you have taken a look at the evidence, and you realise that there isn‚Äôt anything specifically magical about the tape. However, you do fancy a little bit more awareness of your joints and a little bit of sensory tickling. Well, then, that‚Äôs a pretty good reason to use tape. Let‚Äôs take a look in the next few sections on how to tape. But first, let‚Äôs start with some KT tape tips, that are going to save you a lot of headaches.

# ¬†KT tape tips when you are Hypermobile

# Irritation

For those with EDS and velvet skin, and indeed even those without, perhaps those with mast cell issues, the tape can be an irritant, and in some instances cause blisters and soreness. ¬†For KT tape to stick to your skin, it is covered with adhesive. When you apply KT tape, you are recommended to rub the tape to help activate the adhesive. Now, if you do have skin that is irritable (and to be honest, I recommended this for everyone), do a little patch test first. Cut a small square of tape off and apply it to an area for 48hrs, then see how you react. Likewise a really handy tip if you are super irritable to tape, is to use barrier film spray, the same spray used for stoma bags.

# Shave

It‚Äôs all well and good having your tape on, but there will come a time that you need to remove it. Even the smallest of hairs are going to hurt when the tape comes off. So, make sure that you shave the area if it is dense with hair, and you can save yourself some trouble in the future.

# Tape stretches

Often people end up cutting off more tape than they actually need. Remember, that tape stretches, which means that once you apply some tension to it, it will reach further. This is a handy little tip, especially considering how expensive some tapes can be!

# Round off the tape

KT tape has a tendency for the ends to curl up, getting caught on clothing. So, if you are going to tape, round off the corners of your tape and it will last far longer.

# Tear the tape

Trying to pull the backing tape off KT can be frustrating. Instead, if you tear the tape with your hands, you will tear the backing paper, making it easy to remove, whilst leaving the tape unaffected.

# Use water

When it comes time to take the tape off, take it off in the shower or bath. You will find it is far easier!

# Should you use KT Tape for hypermobility and EDS?

1nv3fgm,https://v.redd.it/56oncxoqwgsf1,How I relentlessly track everything I buy and build custom shopping list,"Someone asked this before in the sub where a guy tracked all purchases since Jan 1, 2025. 

Basically, I did the same except that I tracked every purchased item (line item) and used receipts as input. 

WHY? 

Because I was fearful for my situation due to job loss job previous year and I needed some control. I also started panicking at the checkout when I saw $90 totals when I just wanted to buy some groceries. Like wtf, I‚Äôm buying essentials and how come I left almost one hundred dollars? 

Before, to track my spending, I used to dig out transactions from bank accounts and credit cards. I read bank statements and all that, even imported them to a spreadsheet. 

I stopped doing it because of two reasons. First, it was not time-efficient. 1 hour just to know the total sum of how much I spent? Per merchant category? - So what? This info didn‚Äôt help me, only frustrated me. I also use a 3rd-party app that connects to my bank, but it only helps to tag business expenses, etc. 

Secondly, too often I was left confused by unknown merchant names, trying to remember where I was on August 15, or guessing if this was a different day I bought something and this expense just popped out later on my credit card? This is when I realized how tracing back my expenses didn‚Äôt help my situation of saving money. 

So I changed my approach. If every business expense requires a receipt as proof, then I‚Äôd do the same for my personal expenses. 

I started analyzing each item. Then I‚Äôd review purchases (like in the video).

If I thought it was a great purchase - I press the heart ‚ô•Ô∏è emoji and it saves the product id, price, and merchant where I bought it. The best products I‚Äôd mark with a star ‚≠êÔ∏è (sort of favorites). This is how I‚Äôd discover my own preferences and learn  what to buy at the particular store when I go there (and what I won‚Äôt regret later)

If I were disappointed, I‚Äôd blacklist this item and never buy it again. (In my case, buying bad coffee or too many fruits that would be spoiled was a waste of money.) 

Slowly, I built my own ‚Äúplaylist‚Äù of products so I could compare prices and find substitutes. This is how I found that one retailer had  the same carrot cake for $6 and $11 just on different days. Honestly, the price change aspect was surprising, a whole different story. 

Now I track around $15k in expenses just this year that are not rent. I feel that I have a much better relationship with money. I know how much I will spend BEFORE I even leave home. 

I also noticed my receipt total is relatively more. I feel it‚Äôs because I purchased with more confidence and for more days, if not weeks. 

P.S. Ask me anything. Don‚Äôt give up. Track and find better substitutes. Save money and pay off debt. Set goals and listen to what your heart wants.

I've been experimenting with different coffee brewing methods for years, and I thought I'd share my experience comparing espresso machines and percolators. This comparison might help if you're stuck deciding between the two.

I remember when I first started my coffee journey, I was overwhelmed by all the options. But after trying both methods extensively, I've noticed some key differences that might interest you.

Let's start with espresso machines. These bad boys use pressure to force hot water through finely-ground coffee, creating that rich, concentrated shot we all love. The crema (that golden foam on top) is something you just can't get with other brewing methods. I recently got a fantastic machine from https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine that's been a game-changer for my morning routine.

Percolators, on the other hand, work by cycling hot water through coffee grounds repeatedly. They're simple and reliable, but here's the thing - they can sometimes over-extract the coffee, making it bitter. I've found that controlling the brew strength is trickier with percolators.

What really sets espresso machines apart is their versatility. Want a latte? Done. Cappuccino? No problem. These machines come with steam wands for milk frothing, making them perfect for coffee shop-style drinks at home. I've found some great options at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine that won't break the bank.

Here's what I love about espresso machines:
- Consistent results
- Quick brewing time
- Variety of drink options
- Better temperature control
- That perfect crema

Percolator pros:
- Simple to use
- Great for camping
- Makes larger quantities
- Generally more affordable
- Durable construction

One thing I've learned is that espresso machines require more maintenance. You need to clean them regularly and descale occasionally. But honestly, the results are worth it. The rich, complex flavors you get from a properly pulled espresso shot are unmatched.

Percolators are more forgiving with maintenance but less forgiving with brewing technique. The coffee can easily become over-extracted if you're not careful with timing.

Price-wise, there's a significant difference. Quality espresso machines are an investment, but they'll last for years with proper care. Percolators are usually much cheaper, making them a good option for casual coffee drinkers.

In my experience, if you're serious about coffee and enjoy different varieties of coffee drinks, an espresso machine is the way to go. But if you prefer simple, strong coffee and don't mind a bit of bitterness, a percolator might be your best bet.

You know that moment in the afternoon when your phone hits 10% and a mild panic sets in? I was there just last week, scrambling for a charger before a video call. It made me realize my entire schedule was being dictated by a battery percentage.



I started digging into why batteries degrade and found a fascinating tidbit: phone batteries are happiest between 20% and 80% charge. Letting it drain to zero or charging to 100% all the time actually stresses the battery. It‚Äôs like us with coffee‚Äîa little is great, but too much and things get jittery.



That‚Äôs when the rumors about the iPhone 17‚Äôs battery tech caught my eye. They‚Äôre supposedly using a new stacked design that not only holds more power but is far more resilient to that daily wear and tear. It feels like they‚Äôre finally designing for how we actually live, not just for a spec sheet.



So while I wait for that future, I‚Äôve become that person who stops charging at 80%. It‚Äôs a small change, but it‚Äôs oddly freeing to not be a slave to the outlet. The real upgrade will be when the phone just handles it for us, and it seems like the next generation might finally get us there.

Enter my coworker who I will call Brian. Brian discovered TED Talks about three months ago and it has completely taken over his personality. Every single time someone goes for coffee, he appears like a ghost. He will stand there waiting for someone to make eye contact and then launch into ‚ÄúSo I watched this amazing TED Talk last night about resilience in jellyfish communities‚Äù or ‚ÄúThere was a talk about how success is just breathing differently.‚Äù I wish I was joking.

At first it was kind of funny and people humored him. But now it is every single day and multiple times a day. He does not just summarize. He goes into detail like he is trying to recite the transcript. Sometimes he even makes us stand in a little circle while he pretends to be the speaker. I once went to grab tea and he cornered me for fifteen minutes explaining how ‚Äúfailure is actually a gift from the universe.‚Äù I missed a call because of it.

The worst part is that he expects reactions. If you just nod and leave he follows you down the hallway like you are his audience. I have started sneaking my coffee mug in early just to avoid running into him. Other people admitted they switched to energy drinks just so they would not have to go near the coffee machine.

We tried joking about it in front of him like ‚Äúoh here comes our resident professor‚Äù and he just smiled and said ‚Äúknowledge is contagious.‚Äù Someone suggested HR but technically he is not doing anything ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù It is just unbearable.

So do I just accept my fate as a captive audience to Brian‚Äôs coffee break lectures or is there some polite way to tell him to shut up? Has anyone else worked with someone who thinks every breakroom moment is their personal stage?",22,1759309388.0,coworkerstories,16,0.92,False

* Industry events usually deliver more than ‚Äúfounder events‚Äù because that‚Äôs where your customers actually are.
* The biggest ROI rarely comes from the stage. It comes from the hallway chat, the coffee line, or the dinner you almost skipped.
* Events work best when you treat them like a funnel: pre-event outreach, clear targets, and structured follow-up.

In January last year my wife passed away due to sepsis (following a battle with cancer). I had spent many years caring for her and making sacrifices along the way. The year or so after she died was a massive journey for me. I started building a new life for myself, started to think about what I wanted and began to address many long standing issues that I've had since my childhood (such as people pleasing). I came to the realisation that I can't make everyone happy and my feelings matter too.

In April this year I started to try and reconnect with people who I hadn't seen in years. On one particularly bad day, one of those people messaged me and asked if I wanted to come over for a coffee and a chat.

Now for some context, this is a person who I've known since 2007 and we did have a one night stand together before I met the woman who went on to become my wife.

Anyway, I went to see her and I started to have very pleasant memories. Then we kissed. A few more things happened and we ended up in a relationship.

My new girlfriend is 12 years older than me and is going through perimenopause. In addition, she's has disabilities, mental health issues and has had some REALLY BAD relationships in her past. I wanted her to know that I'm not one of those bad guys she's known and for the most part we've had a great time together.

She loves me. She's openly said that. I was honest and said that I'm not there yet, but it doesn't mean I won't ever feel the same. It's just that based on my own background and experiences, I need more time. Everyone is different.

Anyway, recently she went through a bit of a crisis that she put down to menopause. We (for a brief moment) broke up. I couldn't take what she was saying. I felt guilty tripped and I'm at a point in my life where I stand up for myself more. However, after a breather, we met up, talked and now we're back together.

The thing is, she said to me that this sort of episode might happen semi regularly/regularly because of how the menopause affects her. I want to be supportive and I do appreciate what menopause does to a person but, should I just be expected to give in to whatever she says, accept it all and not think about how it's making me feel? I feel like that would set me back on my own journey.

She doesn't want to take medication because of what it does to her hair and I respect that.",0,1759309125.0,Menopause,2,0.33,False
1nv34pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/LovedByOCPD/comments/1nv34pl/ocpd_or_im_insane/,OCPD or I'm Insane?,"Living with someone with OCPD or am I insane?

My girlfriend I suspect has both BPD and OCPD. We have two cats so she insists that we have to vacuum daily. We live in a two story three bedroom townhouse, freshly renovated, and everything brand new. In my eyes, the place is immaculate almost like something out of a designer cataloge. But she insists there's always a mess. She likes the counters to have nothing on them. We hide the small appliances outside of a coffee maker and toaster oven. I used to have a rice cooker out in the counter but stored it because she said ""I like things clean"". She thinks vacuuming every day is important along with mopping every other day. We steam mop weekly or close to weekly. She insists we have to do multiple passes. Once is not enough, we have to do it at least twice even three times. 

She keeps the house looking pristine as possible. She hates ""mess"" which is pretty much anything that ""junk up the place"". She comes from a rich background and maybe that has something to do with it. She also does hoard money for retirement which I understand. She prides herself on not spending any money (guess who did, ME for everything else!). She drives but only to work and back. I do pretty much all the driving and groceries. Because she has a brand new luxury car (Volvo XC40) that she's worried getting chipped, scratched, or dirty. She even washes it once or twice a month when it's barely used. Its stored in the garage so it doesn't get dirty. Her father stores his brand new Mercades next to hers so it doesn't get dirty either. I have no choice but leave it outside since I don't mind it getting dirty. So I HAVE TO DO ALL THE DRIVING. Because she's afraid to drive her car and risk it getting dirty.

I don't come from a money background and maybe it's a rich person thing to want things so clean looking... but I find myself losing my mind with the fear of contaminating the clean look. I think her father also has OCPD and BPD. Like father like daughter.

Am I crazy to think that this level of cleaning is excessive and a sign of OCPD? I love her to death but if she mentions how messy the house is, I'm on the verge of crashing out.

Edit: forgot to mention i feel uncomfortable cooking and sometimes eating because I don't want to make a mess and having to clean up. I love to cook, but I like to keep it looking nice so I don't bother. That's a hobby I gave up when we moved. The appliances are very expensive, so keeping them in tip top shape is important for her. Also the vent blows into the garage where the super nice/expensive cars are kept. So, to avoid conflict, I just don't bother. She doesn't cook and spent majority of her life eating out with her family. Same goes for showering, we don't shower as much because we clean up, wipe down afterwards, squeegee the walls and glass... it's a whole thing that we avoid doing so we shower 1-2 a week to keep the bathroom clean. Showering gives me anxiety because of worry of the clean up afterwards.

It lacked all the petty annoyances of youthful shoplifters with big mouths, daytime drunks and the calls from every Karen who felt they‚Äôve been wronged in some way.¬†

This shift left more time to actually look into the bigger cases and without calls every 5 minutes, his focus was better as well.¬†

As he entered the precinct, his colleague called out as soon as he saw him.¬†

‚ÄúOi, Peri!‚Äù, he shouted, ‚ÄúInteresting case in room 3, thought it would be something for you.‚Äù

Detective Periwinkle looked at Frank with narrowed eyes, while the latter had a big grin on his face. Frank Cordova, his colleague, had a nose for interesting cases, and with interesting it usually meant something supernatural.¬†

Frank‚Äôs nose had landed them in some of the weirder cases they‚Äôd handled so far, but you could never say the work was boring.¬†

Grabbing a cup of coffee from the pot, he headed to room 3, with Frank on his heels.¬†

He paused one moment to take a deep breath and then he opened the door. The room was sparely lit, but then again, most supernatural beings liked the twilight or rather the dark more than the fluorescent lights of the precinct.¬†

That is why all interrogation rooms were fitted with dimmed lights as well, as the human detectives did need some light to do their work after all.

Stepping inside, he closed the door in his partner‚Äôs face. Frank was a good colleague and he had a knack for sniffing out clues, but he wasn‚Äôt the most human- well let‚Äôs say - supernatural friendly detective to come across. His brisk demeanor had ruffled some figurative and even some physical feathers in the past, which is why Periwinkle didn‚Äôt want him in the original interview.¬†

Setting his cup of coffee on the table, he took a seat and pulled out his notebook. He had noticed the shadowy figure in the corner when he first entered the room, but he didn‚Äôt focus his attention on it, instead he simply introduced himself.

‚ÄúGood evening, my name is Don Periwinkle, but you can call me Peri. I‚Äôm one of the detectives of this precinct. Can you tell me your name and the reason for your visit this evening?‚Äù

The shadowy figure in the corner moved towards the table, not taking a seat yet, but that was okay. Supernatural beings tended to be naturally cautious towards the human population and Periwinkle couldn‚Äôt blame them one bit.¬†

1nv2ziw,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1nv2ziw/32m_messed_up_relationship_dynamics/,[32M] Messed up relationship dynamics,"I am a 32M who finalized my divorce this year, though I've been separated since 2023. I moved overseas and now occupy a common room in a co-living flat.

One of my flatmates is a 28F unmarried female nurse. She is in a relationship with another male flatmate who is married, with a wife and two young children back in India.

Now, here comes the messy part‚Äîif it wasn't already. The female flatmate asked me out for coffee. I obliged as a friendly gesture, but I soon got sucked in and started liking her. It reached a point where every time I heard a noise from the kitchen, my mind would tell me to go meet her. I'd end up staying in the kitchen just to talk to her whenever she was there. I couldn't control the impulse. Soon, it became an obsession, and I'd think every notification on my phone was from her.

We started spending time together outside the flat‚Äîgoing to the temple, hiking, and holding hands on walks in the park. I felt we had a real connection. However, one day her partner saw us in the park, and she flipped. She stopped going out with me after that. But I, like a fool, thought if I tried harder, she might choose me.

That's when my downfall began. I started daydreaming in the office about what our life would be like if she accepted me. I couldn't focus on work and began procrastinating on all my tasks.

I started making her overnight oats, avocado shakes, and brownies, even feeding her with a spoon like we were a couple. She liked the care and attention I gave without having to make any real commitment, and this fueled my ""giver"" energy. She began calling me every day after lunch for a chat, and I loved it.

To be clear, she has maintained boundaries; she never entered my room and isn't flirty with me.

I used to literally run home from the office early to make dinner for her, hoping it would be ready before she got back. This ""giver energy"" was my way of showing I cared‚Äîexactly what I did for my ex-wife. Ah, the same old pattern repeating itself.

But every time I heard her laugh with her partner, jealousy kicked in. I'd wonder if they were being intimate at night. The pain was unbearable. Seeing them go out on date nights didn't help.

I never made a move, fearing she would back off and I'd lose the so-called friendship we had.

But something recently changed. I took a hard right and went totally ""no contact,"" going silent. No more breakfast for her, no more please-tries.

She noticed the change and started reaching out on WhatsApp, even opening my room door to check on me. I've started wearing headphones in the kitchen to show I'm not available to talk. She want me to sit at the dining table and talk to her but I would give some excuse and have my breakfast in my room. She keeps reaching out and wants the old me back. I clearly told her that's not possible but seems she think she can reel me back in. 

I like the attention she giving now. She doing exactly what I used to do for her. 

Based on all this, what do you think this woman wants from me?

Is it just the care and attention I gave her, or something more serious? Or does she want to keep me around as a backup option‚Äîsomeone who's always available to take care of her?

She told me her current relationship is temporary, as she plans to move to New Zealand next year.

I plan to move out of this house as soon as possible to find some peace of mind, as the situation is emotionally draining. The loop of giver energy -> satisfaction -> jealously -> pain seems never ending. 
A part of me wants her, but she is not emotionally available now. Then the question of ethics and morality kicks in: if she's involved with a married man now , would she even be the right partner for me who wants to date to marry. No casual hookups. ",1,1759308526.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

There was everything ‚Äî coffee, shade, and company;

Leaves lose their greenery,

Even if it is to be besmeared¬†

I wanted to write a guide for people that were inquiring about fat-loss when quitting coffee, as I have seen many posts on this sub-reddit throughout the years.  
  
I have been into fitness for well over 15 years now, and have helped many people during my career.  
  
So for now, I will primarily focus on why fat-gain would happen when consuming coffee.  
  
Let me preface by saying, that this explanation applies to black coffee only, as coffee with added sugar or cream now has other factors that further complicates my explanation (insulin, empty calories devoid of nutrients).



I might write a second part later on that goes into that, but for now we will simply look at black coffee.

  
So how does coffee affect the endocrine system ?  
  
Coffee contains¬†over¬†1,000 chemical compounds, with caffeine being just one.  
  
Key compounds include antioxidants like¬†chlorogenic acids,¬†trigonelline, and¬†melanoidins, along with minerals like¬†potassium¬†and¬†magnesium, and¬†vitamins¬†such as¬†niacin.



The specific mix and amount of these chemicals vary depending on factors like the coffee bean species, growing conditions, and processing methods.



Caffeine raises cortisol levels by activating the¬†hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a key part of the body's stress response system.  


Cortisol is a vital steroid hormone secreted by the¬†adrenal glands¬†that plays a crucial role in the endocrine system, acting as a ""stress hormone"" to help the body respond to stress by increasing alertness, blood glucose, and metabolism.  
  
People that are (over)consuming coffee, are directly hacking that HPA axis.  
  
Cortisol activates in daily situations like waking up, intense exercise, or social conflicts, leading to a temporary rise in blood sugar for energy and a suppression of non-essential functions like digestion.  
  
After the perceived threat passes, the body's stress response usually calms down and cortisol levels return to normal.  
  
But if you are consuming (too much) coffee on a daily basis, you are never giving cortisol a chance to lower.



Especially if you are raising cortisol through other ways: Not sleeping enough, having a very stressful job, eating a high processed diet that is empty of nutrients (nutrients are needed to lower cortisol).  
  


Symptoms of high cortisol include¬†weight gain (especially in the face and abdomen), high blood pressure, high blood sugar, muscle weakness, bone loss, skin changes like easy bruising, and mood changes such as anxiety or agitation.  
  
So, adding coffee to an already stressful lifestyle could be the reason that your body is holding onto body fat.



Many people on here (and many people I have worked with), have experienced fat-loss while minimising or completely eliminating coffee.  
  
After stopping or minimising coffee intake, your body is finally able to gain a little more control on its HPA axis.  
  
If caffeine was the¬†drop¬†that made the bucket overflow, then amazing results could happen from taking control of your coffee intake. My advice is to eliminate it completely, as a start.  
  
Lowering chronically elevated¬†cortisol¬†provides widespread health benefits, including¬†increased stress reduction, improved¬†mood, enhanced¬†sleep quality, better¬†energy levels, and more stable blood sugar and energy.¬†



All of these will lead to fat-loss, whether directly or indirectly (because you aren‚Äôt stress eating all the time).  
  
Application to coffee with extra sugar and cream:  
  
It is making you fatter, period. Cortisol is raised through caffeine, + you are adding empty calories devoid of nutrients that will end up in fat stores.

# Ronza¬†is a psychological horror game where you play as a timid little girl haunted by fear, paranoia, and an overactive imagination. Terrified of her strict teacher and unable to face another day at school, she secretly skips class‚Äîwithout her mother knowing‚Äîand takes refuge in an old, abandoned hospital on the edge of town.

**The hospital, known as Ronza, was shut down years ago after a series of disturbing incidents that were never fully explained. She doesn‚Äôt know the full history‚Ä¶ but she**¬†***feels***¬†**it.**

**Hiding there, waiting for the school day to pass, she discovers a forgotten admin room with a still-functioning computer full of games‚Äîthe kind she loves. For a moment, things feel okay‚Ä¶ until the hallucinations begin.**

**As she plays, faint voices echo through the halls. Distant footsteps. Crying. The mortuary is just a few doors away!**

**But is any of it real‚Ä¶ or just the product of a frightened child's mind unraveling?**

**Ronza is a deeply unsettling exploration of childhood fear, trauma, and imagination‚Äîwhere reality blurs, and safety is only ever temporary.**

***This game was made by one person with a lot of coffee and a bit of madness and I'll try my best to keep developing the rest of the game with these nights, currently the game has 2 nights, every night shows the story of every single character in the game beginning from night 1, every character can attack you during the night and everyone has his own counter method.***

***This game was inspired by welcome to the game + fnaf, the UI of the operating system was inspired by windows xp.***

***feedbacks are appreciated and I hope you have a great experience!***",1,1759307224.0,IndieDev,0,1.0,False

1nv2k8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1nv2k8j/worrying_about_tightness_in_chest_random_soreness/,"Worrying about tightness in chest, random soreness in alternating limbs","21F, 61kg 156cm. I've been overweight for most of my teenage life and have been diagnosed with anxiety since I was a teenager, and I've been taking Bupropion for the past year or so for it. There haven't been any issues with it. I drink coffee on the daily but was told it was fine and wouldn't affect the medication. For about two years now, I've been having insomnia, the type that causes me to wake up a few times in the middle of the night. Sleeping medication, even the stronger ones, do not have any effect. I do not wake up gasping but occasionally I do get a little short of breath, but that might be because of my blocked nose, which I have on a daily basis (allergic to dust, I use a nasal spray but it still causes blockage).

Over the past few years, I've sometimes noticed that I'd get this weird sensation in the left side of my chest. I can't describe it very well, but it feels like the blood flow in my heart being blocked(?) for a moment, like a clogged/gurgling sensation that takes a few seconds to pass. Also, occasionally, I'd feel slightly ""light""? Not lightheaded, but like my heart has suddenly stopped? and my entire body feels lighter. Whatever it is, it has been causing a lot of anxiety.

  
I know my LDL cholesterol was a bit high for a while, 4.1 the time I last got tested I think. But in early/mid May 2024 I did an ECG and it was okay.

Last year, for a few months, I would get inexplicable bouts of chest pain, on either side of my chest, sometimes dull, sometimes sharp. I'd also get heart palpitations out of nowhere (heart rate speeding up suddenly and slowing down again). Usually it was bursts of pain but occasionally it lasted for 5-10 seconds, or a few minutes. The rhythm is random but a few times I felt my chest hurt in time with my heartbeat. Sometimes there‚Äôs pain in both chest and arm, or sometimes pain in a curving line from armpit to neck. It‚Äôs like something is gripping my chest. I could also hear my heartbeat sometimes, like it was so strong my whole body feels it. Sometimes certain beats are stronger than others too.¬†I‚Äôve also heard soft wheezing/rattling within me. I noticed my feet were swollen in the morning, because when I started walking my nerves prickled and it hurt. There was some soreness in my limbs too, usually in one arm, near the armpit. It worried me a lot and my anxiety was driving me nuts, so I went to a cardiologist to speak about it. I was very concerned so they let me do a test (not sure about the name) where I would carry a device around for one day, with sensors strapped to different areas of my chest, to monitor my heart rate. When the results came back, the cardiologist told me that since I was so young and the pain was random and happening even at rest, it probably wasn't a heart issue, though she also couldn't identify the cause. When I told her about feeling my heart stutter, she said that it was normal for hearts to skip a few beats throughout the day, and that it wasn't a cause for concern.

For the past few days, I've been experiencing a tightness in my chest that won't go away, as well as random bouts of soreness in alternating limbs, even though I haven't been sleeping in a different position or eating differently. It's always a dull soreness like I've just ran a marathon but I haven't been exercising at all so it's strange... I'm trying hard not to freak out but I don't know if I'm overthinking anything because of my anxiety. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!",1,1759306786.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

You know how my phone always dies right when I need to scan a parking ticket? That used to be my signature move. Lately, though, I've been paying more attention to battery specs, especially with the iPhone 17 and the Samsung Galaxy S25 on the horizon. It feels less about bragging rights and more about basic survival.



I remember reading that the average person checks their phone something like 150 times a day. All those tiny moments of screen-on time add up, and that's before you even start streaming videos. It made me realize that battery life isn't about a single, massive number; it's about efficiency across thousands of tiny, unremarkable interactions.



From what I'm seeing, the iPhone 17 seems to be focusing heavily on that exact kind of intelligent efficiency. The talk is that it's not just a bigger battery, but a smarter one that works with the processor to conserve power on the little things, so it has more juice for when you actually need it. It's like having a frugal friend who saves money on daily coffee so they can splurge on a great vacation.



It‚Äôs a subtle shift, but a meaningful one. Instead of just asking ""Who has the biggest battery?"" we're starting to ask ""Who uses their battery the wisest?"" And honestly, for my daily grind of maps, messages, and last-minute ticket scanning, a phone that's clever about its power feels a lot more practical than one that just has a giant tank.
