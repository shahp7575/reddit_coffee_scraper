1qowqy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1qowqy7/how_do_you_find_your_people_here/,How do you find your people here?,"i just started at berkeley as a transfer and i feel like ive had no luck really trying to create friendships. granted it is early but im seeing other transfers who started the same time as me already getting much more established with friendships, regularly hanging out with people, things like that. i on the other hand haven’t made any potential friendship connections. it’s not from lack of effort, im actually really shy and introverted but ive made a huge effort to meet people. i’ve introduced myself to everyone i could, joined every groupchat i could, been friendly, been outgoing, and i haven’t really gotten anywhere. i’ve had plenty of good surface conversations with people but it kinda ends there. i’ve tried asking a good amount of people if they’d want to grab coffee or something similar sometime and all of them stopped answering. or i would get a yeah totally in person but text them following up and get nothing. i made plans one time so far, we had a time and a place we were meeting and i showed up and texted them i was there. i waited 20 minutes at the meeting spot till i figured they weren’t coming. sure enough, my “im here” text was never replied to. 

i’m trying with clubs and joining decals but i just feel so beaten down at this point. i keep trying and no one will meet me half way. i’ve tried talking to people in classes and ive had friendlier interactions but for some reason every time the person i talk to ends up being like 18 and as a 22 year old i really do want older friends. 

i have a group of friends at home that im close with and love but Berkeley is a long ways from where i live so a trip to visit them or a trip for them up here isnt easy and is rare. i cant casually drive down and vice versa. 

i live alone so roommates haven’t been an option for potential connections. and unfortunately the apartment i picked is a little farther from campus. i’m not super far but not walking distance, i have to take the bus. 

i’m just not really sure how to create a circle here. honestly i’d be happy with just one solid friend at this point. i keep trying to make the effort but nothing much is coming from it and im starting to feel less and less inclined to keep trying, i feel like i just keep embarrassing myself. i’m gonna give it a shot with clubs and a decal but beyond that i don’t know what else to do. i want to enjoy my time here i feel so lucky to be at such an insane school but its been clouded by how isolated ive been feeling since being up here. 

it’s just been feeling depressing doing everything i want to do up here alone. ",1,1769562263.0,berkeley,0,1.0,False

1qowpu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMediaMarketing/comments/1qowpu2/5_golden_rules_of_social_for_beginners/,5 golden rules of social for beginners,"Hey! I want to get more involved with my community, so I want to see how this goes. Here are 5 golden rules for anybody getting started with social media, here ya go!

1. **POST!**

This might sound silly. Really silly. But you would be SHOCKED how many people hesitate to pull the trigger on posting because they don’t know what to do. I understand this entirely, but you can’t get better at pitching if you don’t start throwing the ball. Get yourself familiar with regularly posting content on your pages, we will zero in on what to post soon :)

2. **OBSERVE COMPETITORS**

Are you a baker? A musician? A roofer? Doesn’t matter! Take a look at what the power players in your community are posting. How is the big bakery down the street that sells out every day reaching their audience with content? Is the big roofer in town bringing in business by posting videos of the team on the job to show how they work? **Take note of this!!** The people who are working are obviously doing something that is, that’s right, working!! This is a great North Star for finding out what to post.

3. **ENGAGE**

What’s that s-word? That’s right… social! Social media is called **social** media for a reason, we’re here to build connections in our community. Take some time to not only interact with others in your community, but encourage them to do the same! A **call to action (CTA)** is an easy way to encourage interaction with your content. In the baker example, this could look something like posting a picture of your fresh muffins and saying 

“*Fresh out of the oven! Our blueberry, coffee cake, and chocolate chip muffins are made right here on-site every morning* ☀*️**** what muffin looks best to you?***”

**ALSO -** use groups!! Simply sharing your social media posts in relevant groups on platforms like Facebook and Instagram can be an absolute game changer. Think about this: **you’re sharing content directly to a group who made the choice to join because of their specific interests.** You will do much better approaching your target audience directly than you will by hoping your aunt’s comments will make you viral 😉

4. **BE PATIENT**

Nothing happens overnight, especially success on social media. If you post for a few days, even a week or two, and don’t see crazy results, **stick with it.** I have been working on a page where I post every day, and for the first two weeks there was not much in the way of qualitative engagement. Once my content started to gain traction on week 3, all of my previous posts served as a backlog. This means that people clicked through to my profile and found weeks worth of content to engage with. This made my engagement explode around the one month mark, leading to me seeing the **99+** notification bubble for the first time in this profile. **I know it’s tough. I know it takes time. You will thank yourself for sticking with it.**

5. **USE FREE TOOLS**

There are *so* many social media tools at your disposal. Many of them cost money, but many of them have free versions that you can get a **lot** of mileage out of!

• **Canva -** this could be the single best social media tool ever. The free plan allows you edit images with a full suite of tools, create independent designs from scratch, create video, and even pull from an enormous library of templates to kick start motivation! **Pro tip:** since canva’s background remover is not free, try using the site remove.bg to remove backgrounds from any image for free :) 

• **CapCut** \- here’s another mainstay. For those who don’t have access to Premier Pro or Final Cut, CapCut’s free plan is an incredible resource to trim, edit, color correct, add audio, and create text overlays on your videos. You even get some free auto-caption credits, how cool is that!

• **Prequel** \- this is more so for advanced photo edits, but Prequel has some pretty cool free effects that can be applied to your pics. This could look like grain filters, vhs effects, sepia tones, etc. **just be careful!** Sometimes, Prequel will hit you with a sneaky premium feature and not let you save an image. No good :(

• **SnapTik/SnapInsta** \- these are great! Let’s say you take 20 minutes editing a video within TikTok that does really well, so you’d like to post it in instagram. SnapTik.app allows you to save videos right to your device without a watermark. This makes for seamless and aesthetic posting across all apps (you may not the think leaving the watermark makes a difference, but it sure can)

6. **(Bonus) HAVE FUN!!**

Social media is scary! But so are rollercoasters, we still have plenty of fun on those. I understand that this undertaking is intimidating if you’re in unfamiliar territory, but you **will** get through it! I’ve noticed that, pretty universally, many clients of mine warm up greatly after a few weeks of posting and having some fun with their creativity. It’s like riding a bike, it’s very shaky and uncertain in the beginning, but is very practical and fun once you get the hang of it :)

**Good luck!!** If you need any more support, feel free to DM me!",1,1769562184.0,SocialMediaMarketing,0,1.0,False

WTH is wrong with people?","I have no idea why it was suggested to me in my Facebook feed, but there is a group that was advertised to me called ""Borax Group."" It has 191,000 members. These people are literally eating, drinking, and bathing in Borax. There are posts and comments where they talk about how they put a little pinch of Borax in their coffee every morning. Many of the posts are from people who are bathing in Borax and posting pictures of what's left behind in the bath water asking if people think any of it is parasites that were pulled from their body. 

It's insanity. What is wrong with people? Borax is toxic!!! 

And don't get me started on the ones who are giving it to their pets. That's next level grrrrrr worthy. ",1,1769562011.0,venting,1,1.0,False

I didn’t post right away because I needed distance. I needed to see if things would settle if I stopped reacting to every sound, every misplaced object. I needed to know whether what happened was an episode or the beginning of something that was going to keep happening whether I watched for it or not.

I keep telling myself I’ll go back to work tomorrow. I’ve been telling myself that for days. I stayed in the apartment the whole time. 

I slept when I could. Short stretches. Never deeply. I kept the lights on at night. I kept the same routine during the day. I didn’t go back down to the laundry room. I didn’t sit on the couch for too long. I tried to stay present.

For a while, nothing happened.

This morning, I woke up feeling strangely clear. Not rested, exactly, but steady. Like the fog had lifted just enough for me to think straight again.

I went into the kitchen to make coffee.

The sink was empty.

That stopped me.

I stood there staring at it, trying to remember when I’d washed the mug I’d used the night before. I couldn’t. I opened the cupboard.

The mug was there. Clean. Dry. Put away.

I checked the rest of the kitchen.

All the dishes were done.

I don’t mean rinsed and left to dry. I mean washed, dried, and stacked the way I always do it. Plates in order. Cutlery sorted correctly. Even the pan I’d used two nights in a row was back where it belonged.

My trash can was empty.

Not “emptier than I remembered.” Empty.

The liner had been replaced.

I felt that cold, hollow feeling start up again, the same one I’d felt every other time something didn’t line up.

I tried to explain it away. Muscle memory. Habit. Something done without thinking.

Except I couldn’t find a single moment where it fit.

I checked the bathroom next.

The sink was clean. The mirror had been wiped down.

Someone had taken a shower. The mirror was still faintly fogged at the edges.

I hadn’t.

I stood there with my hands on the edge of the sink, trying to feel grounded in my body. Trying to notice where I was, what time it was, what I could remember.

There was no headache. No dizziness. No sense that I’d blacked out.

I went back into the living room.

The couch cushions were straightened. The blanket folded.

Everything looked normal.

That was the problem.

None of this felt rushed. None of it felt panicked. Whoever had done these things hadn’t been confused or disoriented. They hadn’t left half-finished tasks or signs of interruption.

They’d taken their time to make it just right.

I sat down slowly and tried to reconstruct the order of it. Eating. Cleaning. Taking out the trash. Showering. Putting things away.

It wasn’t random.

It followed a routine.

One that looked uncomfortably familiar.

That’s when it hit me that this was much worse than finding folded laundry or hearing a washing machine through the pipes.

Those things could be blamed on someone else. An intruder. Something external.

This couldn’t.

Because whoever did this knew where everything went.

They knew how I lived.

And they were comfortable enough here to clean up after themselves.

I’m writing this now from the same spot on the couch where I’ve been spending most of my time. The apartment is quiet. No humming. No rattling from the pipes.

Everything is exactly where it should be.

And that terrifies me.

Because whatever happened during that missing time wasn’t random.

It wasn’t careless.

Someone was living normally in my apartment.

And I don’t remember being here at all.",1,1769561953.0,ThisIsntRight,0,1.0,False
1qowmfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/1qowmfo/our_food_spot_findings_in_san_jose_will_be/,Our food spot findings in San Jose! (Will be updated constantly),"Hey guys!

10 months ago, I made a post asking for food recs, and you guys shared some AMAZING spots. For better of for worse, my girlfriend and I love eating more then anything and trying out new places is always exciting (although when we find a good spot we usually just go there endlessly until we get the strength to try another spot). I ahve been recording our favorite spots and spots we have yet to go to, for the people who want to try new spots they haven't tried yet! And if you see your favorite place not listed here please share! I will add them to the ""to be tried"" list and share our thoughts!

Note: We have gone to a lot more spots then this, if a spot is listed here, that mean's its GOOD no matter my score, I won't list spots we didn't like, although I might make a section for places we avoid due to mad experiences if it helps (thankfully that hasn't happened really). I will be updating this list as we try new spots. 

**Seafood:**

Cap't Loui (9.3/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/capt-loui-cupertino?osq=crab](https://www.yelp.com/biz/capt-loui-cupertino?osq=crab)

SUPER yummy. Went there for our last anniversary, had snow crab and lobster and it was super good!! There was a decent wait to be seated but worth it in my opinion. I never really have tried seafood like this (where you sit down and have a masive amount of seafood you eat with your hands) but it really warmed me up to it and I hope to try more spots like this spot!

**Korean:**

Danbi for Korean on blossom hill (9/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/danbi-korean-restaurant-san-jose?osq=danbi](https://www.yelp.com/biz/danbi-korean-restaurant-san-jose?osq=danbi)

We didn't get to order much, just ordered rice cakes and the spicy Korean fried chicken, but it was GOOD. Small little restaurant by the Nobhill, but the food/other people's orders we saw looked amazing. Will go back to try more as Korean cuisine is something we have little experience with still and would like to expand on. 

  
**Hot Pot:**

Mikiya wagyu shabu house (9.8/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/mikiya-wagyu-shabu-house-santa-clara-3?osq=Mikiya+Wagyu+Shabu+House+Santa+Clara](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mikiya-wagyu-shabu-house-santa-clara-3?osq=Mikiya+Wagyu+Shabu+House+Santa+Clara)

I have nothing to say here, if you like hot pot or want to try hot pot, go here. I think out of everything ever we have tried, this was and is by far our favorite spot. Make sure to come on a super empty belly (we usually have a light breakfast, skip lunch, and head over here). It's a little pricey (as Hot pot is) so we usually come here for special events like anniversaries or birthdays. They used to have endless hagendaz ice cream too which my girlfriend loves but it seems like they removed it for a ice cream machine, but its still super good!

  
Shabu Time (9.5/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/shabu-time-san-jose-3?osq=hot+pot](https://www.yelp.com/biz/shabu-time-san-jose-3?osq=hot+pot)

Also super good!!! We tried the tonkatsu and miso broths which where super rich and yummy, the meat and addons where good quality too, would recommend this spot too!

  
One pot shabu shabu (9.3/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/one-pot-shabu-shabu-san-jose-san-jose-3?osq=Shabu+Shabu](https://www.yelp.com/biz/one-pot-shabu-shabu-san-jose-san-jose-3?osq=Shabu+Shabu)

This is the spot where my gf and I tried hot pot for the first time, it's a really good spot! In terms of quality of ingredients and options, I feel like it falls behind compared to Mikiya but it's a solid spot if you want to try hot pot for the first time. 

  
**Persian Food:**

Ziba Persian restaurant (9.1/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/ziba-persian-restaurant-san-jose?osq=iranian+food](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ziba-persian-restaurant-san-jose?osq=iranian+food)

Super solid spot! The koobideh kabob and kabob wrap where super good and tasted homemade, just like how my parents used to make. If you're interested in trying out persian food, I would highly recommend this spot! To be honest I haven't tried too many persian restaurants so i'm sure there might be better spots, but didn't find anything wrong with this spot. 

**Pho/Vietnamese:** 

Pho La for Pho (8.9/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-la-san-jose-3?osq=pho+la#reviews](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-la-san-jose-3?osq=pho+la#reviews)

My GO TO pho spot for ever. Pho quality has always been great. Service is not the best (not awful but at the same time kind of meh) and Banh mi's seem to skimp out on meat alittle for my liking, our FAVORITE spot for just Pho so far. 



Pho Teresa (8.6/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-teresa-san-jose-2?osq=pho+teresa](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-teresa-san-jose-2?osq=pho+teresa)

So far our 2nd favorite spot! Pho quality is great as well, we seem to prefer pho la a tad bit more but it's still super good!



**Fried Chicken:**

Angry Chickz for Fried Chicken (9.2/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/angry-chickz-san-jose-2?osq=Angry+Chickz](https://www.yelp.com/biz/angry-chickz-san-jose-2?osq=Angry+Chickz)

Our FAVORITE spot for spicey fried chicken. The spicy sliders are great but honestly the chicken+mac n cheese is our go to. I would rate it higher but don't have much to compare it to....we do come here regularly. 

  
Daves hot chicken (8.8/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/daves-hot-chicken-san-jose-3?osq=daves+chicken#reviews](https://www.yelp.com/biz/daves-hot-chicken-san-jose-3?osq=daves+chicken#reviews)

First spot we both had spicey fried chicken sliders, it was really solid! I think compared to angry chickz, I would prefer angry chickz, but still for sure a recommended spot. 

**Chinese:**

Golden house (8.2/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-house-chinese-restaurant-san-jose?osq=golden+house](https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-house-chinese-restaurant-san-jose?osq=golden+house)

This was our GO TO spot for Chinese. Still is solid but we felt like quality went down a bit after new ownership, but we still do recommend it! Great food quantity for the price and taste is still solid. 



China delight (9.3/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/china-delight-restaurant-san-jose?osq=china+delight](https://www.yelp.com/biz/china-delight-restaurant-san-jose?osq=china+delight)

We found this after Golden House, and it is GREAT. More seating room, better ambiance, but also higher price. But thankfully, food quality is also higher, we highly rec this spot!!! We're kind of americanized so I apologize for our taste, but the orange chicken, combo fried rice, combo chow mein was super good!!



Home Eat (9.6/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/home-eat-san-jose-3?osq=home+eat](https://www.yelp.com/biz/home-eat-san-jose-3?osq=home+eat)

Despite golden house and china delight being about 5 mins from my house, we have come to Home Eat more then any other spot since we found it. GREAT service, GREAT food, amazing price. At the moment, it's our favorite spot in general. 



**Mexican:**

Lucy's mexican grill (9.2/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/lucys-mexican-grill-san-jose?osq=lucys+mexican](https://www.yelp.com/biz/lucys-mexican-grill-san-jose?osq=lucys+mexican)

Really solid asada taco and burritos! It's been our go to spot for always just having good quality asada burritos.

Tacos el compa (9.4/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-compa-taqueria-san-jose?osq=Tacos+El+Compa+Taqueria](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-compa-taqueria-san-jose?osq=Tacos+El+Compa+Taqueria)

In my opinion its superior to lucys, BUT the two times I went, I had to wait about 35-40 mins for a burrito and 3 tacos. We mainly go out on sunday nights so I know its a busy time, but no other mexican spot had wait times like that. 

Asi Mexican Fusion: [Así Mexican Fusion Bistro](https://www.yelp.com/biz/as%C3%AD-mexican-fusion-bistro-san-jose) 

Mexican/Middle eastern fusion, My girlfriend really loves the loaded papas and I usually get the shawarma plate and it's super good! I'm middle eastern and my gf is mexican so it's a nice experience to have a fusion meal.



**Pizza:**

Cali pizza (9.1/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/cali-pizza-san-jose?osq=cali+pizza](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cali-pizza-san-jose?osq=cali+pizza)

INSANE deals on tuesdays (40% off), and before this we never tried indian pizza, and we where pleasantly surprised by how good it is! (They have non indian pizza too). Cali special combo,Creamy chicken tikki masala,Pesto chicken combo, supreme, and the tandoori chicken pizza have all been AMAZING.

Pappa Georggeo Pizza (9/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/pappa-georggeo-pizza-san-jose-5?osq=Pappa+Georggeo](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pappa-georggeo-pizza-san-jose-5?osq=Pappa+Georggeo)

Also very solid pizza! In a kind of sketchy spot but we always order for pickup and quality has always been great. 

  
**Burgers:**

Kirk's Steakburgers (9/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/kirks-steakburgers-campbell-campbell?osq=burgers](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kirks-steakburgers-campbell-campbell?osq=burgers)

Super solid burgers! Honestly usually we just go to In-n-out, we've tried a lot of other burger spots and we usually just default back to in-n-out but this place is somewhere that wants us to go back again. 

El Bumangues (8.1/10) [**https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-bumangues-san-jose-2?osq=burgers**](https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-bumangues-san-jose-2?osq=burgers)

I think this spot might not be to our taste, but is good enough to be on the list. She ordered the papas locas and I got la champi. I think its worth a try to see if it's for you, it wasn't bad by any means, just not our preference. 

  
**Japanese:**

Cha Cha sushi (9.4/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/cha-cha-sushi-san-jose?osq=cha+cha](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cha-cha-sushi-san-jose?osq=cha+cha)

I haven't gone ina while but it has always been SUPER good. If you can get past the long wait times, I haven't had a bad sushi order ever and the fried ice cream was delicious!



Senro Sushi (8.7/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/senro-sushi-san-jose?osq=senro+sushi](https://www.yelp.com/biz/senro-sushi-san-jose?osq=senro+sushi)

Was pleasantly surprised for mall sushi, it was pretty good! Cha Cha is a tier above it for sure but if you need a quick fix and are in the mall, I recommend it!



 Miyakko's (8.9/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/miyakko-japanese-cuisine-san-jose-2?osq=Miyakko+Japanese+Cuisine](https://www.yelp.com/biz/miyakko-japanese-cuisine-san-jose-2?osq=Miyakko+Japanese+Cuisine)

I'm going to be a little biased here, my Mom would bring me here as a kid on special occasions so it holds a special place in my heart. I love the ambiance and how small/cozy it is, and everything I have tried has and is still good (Miso soup, sashimi's, udon ramen, and their bentos). I feel like the quality has dropped since I was a kid, but I still hold this spot close to my heart. 



Mimi's kitchen (9.4/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/mimis-kitchen-san-jose?osq=MiMi%E2%80%99s+Kitchen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mimis-kitchen-san-jose?osq=MiMi%E2%80%99s+Kitchen)

One of our top favorite spots for sure!!! Amazing quality food and super affordable!! My gf really loves the ramens and the sizzling chicken katsu has been my go to always! Would highly rec this spot!



Ramen champ (8.8/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-champ-san-jose-2?osq=ramen+champ](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-champ-san-jose-2?osq=ramen+champ)

Usually, My Gf and I are aligned on reviews but split here, I would rate this spot a 8.4 and she rates it a 9.2. We both LOVE ramen, but for some reason, this spot doesn't really hit the spot for me. It's not bad though for sure, my gf for sure loves this spot! 



Udon Mugizo (9/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/udon-mugizo-san-jose-san-jose?osq=ramen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/udon-mugizo-san-jose-san-jose?osq=ramen)

 I would personally place this a tier above Ramen champ, my gf loves both! The tonkatsu ramen was super good!!



Hokkaido Ramen (8.4/10) [https://www.yelp.com/biz/hokkaido-ramen-santouka-san-jose?osq=ramen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/hokkaido-ramen-santouka-san-jose?osq=ramen)

The first time we came here, it was AMAZING, I probably would of given it a 9.3, but we came here recently about 2 months ago, and it was sub par. The ramen was almost luke warm, and the taste was off. Hopefully it was a just an off day, as this spot is what got my gf into ramen.

We really like anything and would love to try foods from areas we have never tried before (like Thai, indonesian, etc etc). Also don't really know of any good Italian spots, I grew up with Angelo's but I heard their quality has dropped as of late :( We also would like to try more Korean food

This is just....wow.

As if the burnt walnut raspberry maple moose sphincter wasn't low class enough, you have to publicly display your little red rocket for this? This crap? They probably don't even use real coffee in here. Wouldn't matter if they did, you won't be able to taste it over the 87 chemicals. This is the equivalent of choosing not to go to your local bakery and getting a real, fresh made apple pie and instead going to a vending machine and getting a pack of expired Walmart brand snack pies.

Even from you, Matthew, this is just vile. You're 40, for god's sake. Act like it once in a while. When your order arrives donate it to some needy college kids that need it and don't know any better, then get your lazy ass to a local coffee shop and support a local business. Clown.

1qowjkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentsofmultiples/comments/1qowjkr/the_overstimulated_mama/,The overstimulated mama,"I wake up to a text from my husband. I groan as I read the words. 

“He woke at 4:30am again”

He’s talking about our 4 year old son who will sleep through the night but no later than the crack of dawn, currently. 

Why is he doing this? 

My poor husband suffering the early wakes on his own in the spare room, as I sleep in the main bedroom with our 6 month old twin daughters who are pretty sound sleepers throughout the night. But now one is coughing herself awake because she has caught whatever bug our son brought home from daycare. Awesome. I was planning on going to playcenter today and was looking forward to getting out of the house, but I guess I’m stuck here again. 

I get the baby back to sleep in bed with me, I’m awake now so she’s safe next to me. 4 year old barges in and whispers but it’s practically a yell “Dad’s gone to work now can you get up with me?” 

Let me just wake up for a minute before you start barking orders at me, kid. 

Both babies startle awake because my 4 year old can’t do anything at a quiet volume. Cool. I guess we are all getting up now.  He rips the sheets and duvet off me to try entice me to get out of bed. 

“Mum I can see blood on your undies and on the bed”. Brilliant, day 4 of the second period I’ve had postpartum and it’s hitting me like a tonne of bricks. No one told me that having my tubes removed would make my period 10 times heavier than it was before. And now I have blood on my new white sheets. Why the fuck did I buy white sheets? I was playing with fire and have no one to blame but myself. Cool, now an extra load of washing to do today, on top of the 3 waiting for me in the garage. 

I make my way to the lounge, both babies in my arms. 4 year old excitedly tells me he’s set up a game for me to play. The same game I set up for him yesterday afternoon- the alphabet written on post its, hidden around the house and you have to go find all the letters. Now he wants me to do it at 6:45am. 

I haven’t even had a coffee yet. 

His tablet is blaring the bluey theme tune. 

“Can you turn it down mate?” 

“No I’m watching it”

I snatch his tablet from his hand and turn the volume down. 

“I’m hungry can I have a sandwich”

“Yea bud I’ll make you one in a sec just let me make the babies a bottle first”

“My drink bottle is empty I need some water can you fill it” 

“Yes darling just give mummy a minute ok?” 

The babies are howling now, they’re starving and the bottle machine is taking too long but I can’t make it go any faster. 

Someone walks past the house and both dogs start barking in unison. 

“Shut up!” I yell whilst attempting to take a deep breath. 

The same dogs I used to adore, but now resent. It’s not their fault. My world changed when I had my son. I couldn’t give them the attention I used to, so now they’re just part of the furniture. We pay for a dog walker (fortunate, I know). They get fed, they have cozy crates to sleep in. But they don’t get the love that they used to. Another thing to feel endlessly guilty about. 

I need to take meat out of the freezer to defrost for dinner, I think to myself. 

I get the bottles to the babies and they’re happy now.

“Can you play my game now?” 

“Give me a sec mate I need to go for a wee”

I still haven’t made a coffee. I can feel myself starting to rage. My slippers are making my feet hot and my hair tie feels too tight. 

“Can we play after you’ve gone toilet?” 

“I said yes! Just give me a fucking second!” I yell while trying to change a tampon. 

He runs to the lounge crying because I yelled at him, and trips over something on the way. Now he’s crying even harder. I told him to stop running in the house, and now he’s tripped over a toy I asked him to put away last night. For fucks sake. 

I try to take another deep breath. My 4 year old is crying, the dogs are still barking, and the babies need their nappies changed. 

How many minutes until I can drop my son off at daycare? They don’t come fast enough some days. 

I get everyone calm, apart from myself. But I’m trying to stop my blood from boiling. 

“Alright, I’m ready to play your game just tell me what to do” I pretend like I don’t already know. 

I walk down the hallway seeing post it’s all over the floor. All I can think about is all the housework I have to do, and all the mess I can see. 

Don’t forget to take meat out of the freezer, I think to myself for the second time. 

One of the babies is crying now. She wants her nappy changed. 

I have to stop playing the game. My son starts crying again because the baby needs me. 

I can feel the tears building inside me but I’m trying to hold it in. I’m angry that everyone always seems to need me at the same time. I feel guilty for expecting my 4 year old to regulate his emotions when I can’t even regulate my own. 

I get a baby sorted and restart the game. 

The other baby starts crying, now she needs me. 

Someone walks past the house again. Cue dogs barking. This startles the other baby. Now they’re both crying. Fuck. 

I check my phone. Shit, I didn’t realise the time. 

“Mate, can you go get yourself dressed we need to go in a minute”

This makes my son cry even harder. “I thought you were playing my game, we aren’t finished!” 

“I know hun, I’m sorry but we are going to be late if we don’t get ready”

“You’re a mean mum I don’t like you anymore!” He screams at me as he runs to his bedroom and reluctantly gets dressed. 

I know, fuck. Don’t you think I already know? I know  I’m being a shit mum. 

I’m still holding back tears. 

I get the babies in their capsules. 

“Mum one of the babies has done a poo”

Jesus H Christ, I just want to get out the door. 

I change another nappy and we get in the car. 

I still haven’t taken out the meat of the freezer. 

We get to daycare and the music is blaring while the other kids are having some kind of dance party. Get me the fuck out of here, I think while my eye is twitching even harder than before. 

I leave my 4 year old and practically run back to the car, carrying two capsules, praying no one stop me to make small talk. Still holding back tears. 

I didn’t put my tampon in far enough and I can feel it. Ick. 

I get home and see the mess still waiting for me. The bottles from this morning still waiting to be washed and sterilised. 

The babies are asleep. Finally, a minute of peace. I sit down and open the can of full sugar Red Bull that I’ve convinced myself I need. I try to dissociate by opening Instagram. The first post I see is some fitness influencer saying “wE aLl HaVe ThE sAmE 24 hOuRS iN a DaY”. Like fuck we do, bitch, I think as I close the app and throw my phone to the other side of the couch. I can’t deal with that shit today.  The courier driver drops something at my door and this sets the dogs off again. Both babies wake and start screaming and now I want to scream with them. 

Sometimes I don’t feel cut out for this life. I want to run away to an isolated island where I don’t have any responsibilities, I dream to myself while trying to push down the feelings of guilt. Does it ever get any easier? Why does it look so easy for everyone else? Am I just terrible at this? 

Fuck, I still haven’t taken that meat out of the freezer. Guess we’ll try again tomorrow. ",1,1769561751.0,parentsofmultiples,1,1.0,False

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere in the world)
* 20–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

1. One thing you’d love to do together on a lazy Sunday
2. Where you are right now (city/prefecture in Japan, or city abroad)

How am I supposed to live with myself when even the act of purchasing a cup of coffee or a new sweater is supporting inexcusable evils. How can I enjoy my life when the woman who stitched my jeans is essentially a slave making 10 cents a day? While I try my best to practice sustainability and shop small I can’t always afford it and i’m so riddled with guilt every time I walk into a store. Even creating this post is ruining the environment and I feel so stuck because no matter what I do i’m supporting evil companies who don’t give a crap about humanity or our planet. I’ve tried therapy and all the tactics but all the advice I get is just to care less, but I can’t care less I care way too much and feel like i’m turning my back on humanity if I ignore it.

I j been with my girl for three years now. when we first got together it was a little after she had her child from her previous relationship. me and lil ma met when he was 8 months old and we were inseparable after that. so now fas forward we been together three yrs now lil man is 3 boutta b 4 soon and one of the toughest things for me is when he gets mad or acts up or throws a tantrum he says he misses his dad. I usually take a deep breath and say im sorry buddy but lately it really really irks me.  his sperm donor father and I don’t get a long bc he constantly talks down on my girl his bm threatening to fight me or start problems bc he a grow man who cant get his own life together and takes it out on his son, constantly saying he wants to give up rights ot he doesn’t have the need or time to see him or the proper necessities to take him. the first yr with my girl he saw his son a total of 11 times in 11 months. now I per didn’t have any problems with dude before this relationshi but it wasn’t until he was threatening me or my girl that we had problems. but now to my point one day on the walk to the school bus lil man was throwing a fit I walked him off to the side and asked him what was wrong at 6:45 in the am that he was throwing a fit. his crying response was I miss my dad. now it was 6:45 am i havent had any coffee or anything like that and had poor sleep the night before. my response was quick and swift I said to be honest buddy fuck your bitch ass father…….. his mom my girl heard it on the baby monitor and texted me immediatel. I told him look buddy I love you so much and I’m sorry you miss your dad but you gotta focus on who’s here for you. you can’t let someone who ain’t around ruin your day and continued to list off all the ppl he talks to on a regular basis me his mom memaw pepaw all his aunties and uncles and all his lil friends and hes say okayy. I asked him if he was going to let it ruin his day he said no I said my man gave him lovins which is high fives knuckles an noggin (head butt from shark tale) and he goes onnthe bus. inwas walking hole thinking to myself was that fucked up or was that the right thing to do. My son is a very intelligent person for his age and can explain his frustrations and feelings. My response was clearly out of anger bc he was hurt I don’t make it a habit of speaking down on his father to him at all and always encourage him to speak to his dad when he can. But I really genuinely get pissed this man doesnt care. That his son cries for him and his best response I have no need to see him or I don’t care. so am I wrong for that slip up. they have a custody agreement mind you and hes only seen him 45 times out of 365 days and doesnt call to check in on him and has a gf that he can’t have his child around bc it’s not her kid. ps fuckk that man ps to my son if you see this one day I love you with my heart and always have your back and will always be there for you",0,1769561485.0,smosh,1,0.1,False

Backstory I'm a 33 year old divorced momma who is absolutely beating life after a very bad emotionally and financially abusive marriage. I have lost a lot of weight and feel beautiful in my body for the first time in my life. I have been in therapy for the entirety of my divorce and post to work on healing and finally looking at dating. 

Moving to current story, there is a funny coworker of mine (35male) who is also divorced and the main caregiver to his child. We are both from relatively similar upbringings and laugh at the same jokes. We started chatting mainly because of the similarities in our lives and the struggle of co-parenting as the main stable parent for our kids. 

Somewhere in the morning chats and water cooler talks, we started having a witty banter full of sarcasm, inside jokes, and dad jokes (as he says, all his jokes are dad jokes). We talked about the issues with dating as divorces and boundaries for our kiddos. This guy is known as a super stoic calm and collected person at work. He's even told me it takes a moment for him to warm up to people and show his true self. 

We talked about how he's got big black cat energy.

Well, I'm Golden retriever energy. And I own it. 

This last week he told me point blank 'when I like someone, I either don't do anything and let it go or I say something completely outlandish.' because he doesn't want to make people feel awkward. 

Welp since then he's said to me: 'jesus, take his clothes off am I right ladies?' when we said Jesus take the wheel. 

'hey pimp,' he said to me first thing in the morning and I still was getting coffee cups. 

And going full kawaii peace sign when I walked by. 


So I think he was letting me know that he might like me given current story. But I need help, should I just like ask? Is it too presumptuous to think he was giving a hint?

1qowcbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qowcbi/hr_nuclear_armageddon_is_in_7_minutes/,[HR] Nuclear Armageddon is in 7 Minutes.,"Total nuclear annihilation is at 6 o’clock tonight: it is 5:53pm and I wait on the porch for certain death. Gently rolling the heels of my boots against the plank floor, I rocked gently in my chair: a lukewarm cup of coffee lay on the table by the untouched daily paper, and gently resting under the window behind was my browning double-barrelled shotgun.

You never thought the end of the world would be spread by word of mouth, but in rural Spokane, it started with the mailman; then the neighbour; then the delivery boy on his bike. Whispers arose this morning about a plane due to ride across town, and later, that it was a military aircraft. Heads no doubt turned, a lot stayed still. 

That was my second surprise when sitting on the precipice of absolute doom: it’s quiet. Peacock Meadows, our little hamlet on the outskirts of town, barely moved. Silhouettes occasionally passed windows but I was the only person outside, and I had been since the mailman came forty minutes ago to give me the last copy of *The Spokesman.* 

He was the one who told me. 

“Presidents day,” he said, “...best day to do it.”

I stood with my fresh mug of coffee on the stoop, I had just taken the rolled newspaper from his hand and, as I remember, we’d only been talking for a few minutes, mostly on trivial bullshit. But that final part caught me.

“Gonna be a big one, no holding back. Right at the town square. Everyone’ll see it for miles,” He didn’t meet my eyes when he said it. He seemed… not solemn, exactly. Just careful. Like he’d already had this conversation twice today and didn’t want a third person telling him he was exaggerating. “The sky will be *filled* with smoke, but I guess that doesn’t matter, it’ll clear eventually, always does.”

I was taken aback. 

“Uh,” I turned to place my coffee and the paper on the small table by the rocking chair, “Should I…be leaving now?”

He offered an innocent chuckle but muted it with his hand, and by the time he withdrew it from his mouth, all smiles had disappeared completely, “I mean, you’d be cutting it close,” he said, “but if it’s any consolation - staying here wouldn’t make much a difference to going anyway. Something that big? You ain’t missing it. Wouldn’t matter.”

He hissed air through his teeth and clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth. 

“Sooner I finish here, less of a chance I don’t get home. It’ll be gridlock downtown, ” He replied, fishing in his bulking rucksack for a fresh paper, turning in the direction of the neighbours, “better I spread the word though! Anyway, enjoy the show.”

He chuckled once more, dry and forced, and trailed off across the sidewalk. 

My grandfather, Jonathan Becks, was a fighter pilot in World War II. All throughout my life, from when I understood spoken English until his death in 2009, he told me tales about the war. Young me got the funny stories: jokes, routines, the little moments of being a kid in a man’s uniform.

Years later, when he got sicker and I got older, he opened up about the darkest parts of deployment. Things he’d sat alone with for decades. Confessions. The worst one -the most terrifying and visceral - was Nagasaki.

Not long after the blast, he flew over the city as part of the post-strike assessment. There were cameras on board for documenting the impact site. He told me he flew low. Low enough to see it wasn’t a city anymore, just a smudge against the landscape, an abscess of smoke and char. At that altitude he was spared no recourse from the devastation caused by his country: although he couldn’t see faces nor specifics, he could see clusters of the dead near the riverbanks, and the living walking without purpose or direction. He told me, “Pray you die in the blast, ‘cus afterwards, it’s nothin’ but agony, for everyone.”

I was in my early twenties when he told me the story, it must’ve been three weeks before he’d pass, and he spared no details. Not only from his experience but what his buddies told him, too: on-the-ground perspectives from citizens who’d been interviewed and tales of the ‘alligator people’ who were so badly maimed they could do nothing but crawl. 

The bomb had tormented my grandfather’s life.

The bomb quickly became a torment to me, too.

Teachers said I had a ‘good capacity to create my own worlds’ when I was younger - a pretty fucking convoluted way of saying I daydreamed too much. Unfortunately, on the day my grandfather confessed, that bad habit became a cancer that metastasised over my mind. Non-stop film reels of the attack. 

Thinking of the size of the blast;

The brightness of the blast;

The temperature of the blast. 

I would lay in bed next to my wife and imagine the rumble, the falling of glass in glittering shards, the scorch. Maybe it would be painless, sure, but that’s no guarantee. But I guess the mailman was right: in the end, it *“wouldn’t matter.”*

Nuclear Armageddon is in 5 minutes.

My hands are still vibrating. 

I stare out over the humble skyline of Spokane. We were never a prominent name in urbanism; our tallest buildings would resemble cargo containers to the big cities, like New York. A bomb would crumple it like a sandcastle. 

The Bank of America Finance Center, our tallest and proudest monument to commerce, would surely pop like a zit from the initial shockwave. Glass would be shredded from the windows and rebar would erupt from the walls.

The Davenport Hotel would be a tin-can containing hundreds of people, kicked quite literally against the curb. But if the mailman was right, and it was due to the center-masse of our little city, my wife and I wouldn’t have been the ‘lucky ones’: radiation would come in droves and would kill us from the inside, turning intestine and kidney alike into pink pulp.

I couldn’t let that happen. Not to the woman I love. 

This rocking chair I sat on, gently careening backwards and forwards, was supposed to be where I sat with a son or daughter on my knee, answering their questions about how the world worked. My wife and I - we’d only recently looked at renovating the spare room into a nursery. Not pregnant yet but…preparation couldn’t hurt, right?

I snorted, bitterly. The most I did in that room was put up a shelf. 

Before I left the front door to sit out here, I’d snagged a pack of Marlboro Reds from the desk drawer in my office, where I’d kept them for emergencies. When I put them there though, I’d imagined ‘emergencies’ to consist of an argument with my wife or maybe an unpaid bill coming to bite me in the ass. A nuclear holocaust wasn’t exactly on the bingo cards. I guess I’ll be having two.

Flicking the box, every cigarette sat filter-up but one: my grandfather smoked like a chimney, it was what killed him, and he always flipped one cigarette to face the other way. Apparently, he’d picked it up from a marine he met. Well, I got into the practice of it too, a way to honour the old man.

I struggled to light it. Every finger had pin-and-needles, my index twitched and it made me drop the zippo flat onto my lap. The eventual huff of acrid smoke was like heaven, only for its cindering tip to remind me of what’s about to happen. I almost put it out. Almost.

Nuclear Armageddon is in 4 minutes.

There are a few sirens in the distance. Civil unrest must be rising in the city center, people clawing to get as far away as possible. I guess they didn’t understand how nukes work, but yet again, I’d done way more research into them than your average person.

They were trying to squander the only merit to their situation: proximity. They would be nothing but shadows on the pavement at such close range, many have died worse deaths than that. Instantaneous. That’s the way.

Taking another long pull of the cigarette, I flickered my eyes towards my shotgun  that I had stood against the windowpane, still entrenched in thought. I guess that was an instant way out, too: hell, I’d even taken the care of putting a second shell in the barrel.

Thinking over a nuclear blast event, so vividly and often, I found that I’d started to dramatize it all in my head. Everything got bigger on every little simulation in my mind. So, as it lay only minutes away, I found myself becoming more and more of a hypocrite. I was… morbidly fascinated with it and suicide felt like heresy. All of this fear, constantly revolving around hypotheticals, had eaten at me so much that when I was finally met with the opportunity to see it for myself, it felt as if I could finally put a face to a name. There’s no easy way of describing it: I just *needed* to experience it. 

My wife didn’t. She didn’t have the curiosity that I did. She didn’t experience the fear that I always had. 

I continue smoking. 

Nuclear Armageddon is in 3 minutes.

Finishing my cigarette, I put it out on my copy of *The Spokesman.* Half-folded, I could only make out the tips of today’s big title, and that’s all I really needed to see. News of the attack would have only become common knowledge an hour ago, and the mailman would have already been hurling these into laws and postboxes: nothing on that page would be of any value to me anymore. Keeping up with college football or the recent mayoral election felt so insignificant now.

The sirens were getting more plentiful - I figured that people were really starting to lose their shit now. The doors to public buildings were probably being shut in the faces of panicking crowds, aching to find shelter from the empty street, and the police were probably being swept up in the trampling masses as opposed to policing them. Poor bastards. Nobody asked for this.

Nuclear Armageddon is in 2 minutes.

As I stare out over Spokane, a cruiser begins to drive towards the street. Its lights flash and sirens carve up the silence that had reigned over Peacock Meadows since I'd come back out on the porch.

I continue to rock and reach into my pocket for that second cigarette.

Two officers emerge from the cruiser and, upon glancing the shotgun by my window, immediately seem apprehensive.

“Is al-o-st t-ighm!” I shout with the cig in my teeth, which melted my speech into a slew of vowels. Upon lighting it, I took it from my mouth, “Go home to your families.”

The two of them resemble a comedic duo: short and pudgy, taller and thin. From the passenger side, the shorter one wouldn’t dare step toward the curb, but the taller one walked closer with a hand resting near his belt. “We’re more worried about yours,” he said.

Nuclear Armageddon is in 1 minute.

I snort, sigh, and motion towards the firearm that they’re oh-so-scared of. 

“You don’t gotta worry about that,” I shout back at them, almost playful-like, as I once more continue to choke that smoke deeper into my lungs, “Look: you may not see it right now, but in sixty seconds, you’ll understand *why*.”

And if right on cue: a blip begins to swim across the skies from somewhere to the west. It looks like a gnat, a flea: ironic, the thing that kills me looks like it could be found crawling through the hairs of a housecat. The police keep calling out but my eyes stay glued firmly on the plane. It is so graceful. It twists and turns, elaborately threading the air until I notice the plumes of colour jetting out from behind it. 

At first, it looks like the regular steam.

But as I continue to focus, I can’t help but notice that it's red. The plane is spewing red shit. The plane coming to kill us all has red smoke coming from its tailend.

I have never been a Biblical man. Nobody in my family ever has. My grandfather gave up believing in the war and, thus, he didn’t give my mother much incentive to become a churchgoer. All this being said, I can’t help but see the correlation between the red smoke of the bomber and the lava soaked plains of Hell.

I guess it’s much too late to ask for a pardon from God. Not after what I did. I’d be down there, with the sinners and the wretches. I’ll be getting what I deserved. But, at least to me, I’ll know what I did was a kindness to somebody I loved.

Nuclear Armageddon is in 30 seconds.

The police. The street. The newspaper. The skyline. The plane. I shut it all out as I squeeze my eyes shut. The cigarette was no longer in my hands, I must’ve dropped it. I can still taste it. It coats my throat.

The light hitting my eyelids casts strange shapes and colours across my vision. It’s all mostly orange and red, big plumes and blotches. Soon it may turn white.

I’m counting down in my head the entire time now.

*19, 18, 17…*

Honestly, I think I’d live everything the same, if I get reincarnated. Down to every last detail. I’ve always lived as an honest, caring, kind person. I’ve always tried to do what's right for people, even if *they* didn’t know it.

*…14, 13, 12…*

I just realised, this entire time, I didn’t even tell you my wife’s name. It is, or it *was*, Josie. The only girl I ever loved, somebody beautiful, somebody empathetic. When you love as hard as I did, you’d wish your loved one would never have to endure any pain or hardship ever again. The very thought of it breaks you. You want them to be numb to all the bad in the world.

*…9, 8, 7…*

That’s why I did it.

Please, please understand. 

When we were younger, we had this dog who got a bad infection on its belly. Caught itself on a fence. My grandfather told me, after letting me say my goodbyes, that it's “better to help it not hurt than do nothing.” 

I was just trying to spare her from the blast. She didn’t know what I knew.

*…3, 2, 1…*

Suddenly, I was ejected from the rocking chair and flung into the small wooden table at my left. Coffee splashed against my back and, a second later, ceramic crunches as it hits the floor. My wrists are pinned against my back.

“-to control, we were responding to the 10-103, suspect has been apprehended-”

After a few seconds, I slowly peel my eyelids back up. The fat officer was the one to grab me, pinning me to the floor with a knee that dug into my spine. His partner, the tall one, took the shotgun and tossed it out into the yard across the grass. A few seconds later, that same officer opens the door to our home and walks inside.

From the radio that the little officer has on his shoulder, I hear the words of his partner, all tinny and crackly. His voice is shaking.

“-uh, reporting one female, they are D.O.A., I repeat - one deceased female, looks like- fuck, it looks like an gunshot wound to the back of her head-""

And his words bleed out as I crane my neck and turn to look away. White fragments of my mug litter around a central puddle of coffee that had stained the woodboards. This smear manages to catch the corners of that copy of *The Spokesman*, now flat across the ground with its title in booming letters. At the angle of reading it, seeing as my cheek was pressed to the floor, it took me a little longer to make out the words.

But I do:

‘PRESIDENTS DAY AIR SHOW: 6PM, RIVER PARK SQUARE.’

With my gut now in free-fall, my eyes darted around, desperate to catch something that proves I was right. That makes this all mean something. That it, the *bomb*, was happening. I only manage to catch glimpses of that plane careening over the skyline. 

There’s more of them now.

4 different aircraft in total.

They spin in formation and do loop-da-loops in perfect synchronisation.

They all have different colours of smoke. Red. Blue. Green. Yellow.

They use these trails to create patterns in the sky. Behind, I hear a huff of resignation.

“Alright,” the officer behind me says, “Up you come.”

He hoists me up by the arm.

An ambulance is here now, a stretcher clatters up the stoop where I’d stood this morning, coffee in hand, talking to the mailman.

*An Air Show*, I thought to myself - nausea rising, words turning to static.

*He was talking about an Air Show.*",1,1769561243.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

But it is actually rather uncomfortable if you think deeper about it. 

Firstly, the sofa seats are usually not high enough for you to lean on it, eat and/or drink at the same time. Unlike chair seats (that have backs), you have to take your entire plate to eat if you want to lean on the sofa at the same time. That may cause you to drop your food if you are not careful. Same for drinking too, you may spill your drink.

Secondly, sitting on the sofa strains my back, unlike chair seats (that have backs). 

I am not sure why so many people seem to find sofa seats more comfortable, but chair seats (with backs) are more comfortable and easier to eat and drink.",0,1769561029.0,The10thDentist,9,0.45,False

Basically I have a movie talk channel where I do reviews, upcoming films I’m excited for, trailer breakdowns, and the occasional one off “random thing I wanna talk about”

I just posted a “random thing I wanna talk about” video around DVDs, and it did shockingly well. I usually get 50-100 views in the first day, this got 7,000. Now it’s at 10k. Awesome! Super awesome! 

Only thing is it’s not my typical content. It’s that random thing. I’d love to keep my routine going of the videos I enjoy making- those new movie reviews and upcoming films and more random things, but I worry thats not what these new viewers (and 150+ new subscribers) care for.

What do you think? Try to milk what I know works? Physical media, DVD talk, stuff tailored to the older generation? Or should I just keep going wit my original plan and see what happens, despite the lower views I’m likely to get….

Jess: turning the sprinkler back on for Rory so Dean could come save the day/not know Jess was there. I also really loved when he brought a Luke’s care package over.

Logan: helping get the daily news submitted when Paris took over as editor, he was also very sweet when Richard was in the hospital 

Max: buying Lorelai and Rory ring pops

Jason: Jason’s speech about his apartment key and how he wanted Lorelai to have it  

Luke: building Lorelai the ice rink

Chris: planning the drive in movie with Lorelai. I think this is one of the best dates in the show and really shows how well he knows her. Unfortunately he is a terrible partner and father but at least he can plan a date? 😂

You never thought the end of the world would be spread by word of mouth, but in rural Spokane, it started with the mailman; then the neighbour; then the delivery boy on his bike. Whispers arose this morning about a plane due to ride across town, and later, that it was a military aircraft. Heads no doubt turned, a lot stayed still. 

That was my second surprise when sitting on the precipice of absolute doom: it’s quiet. Peacock Meadows, our little hamlet on the outskirts of town, barely moved. Silhouettes occasionally passed windows but I was the only person outside, and I had been since the mailman came forty minutes ago to give me the last copy of *The Spokesman.* 

He was the one who told me. 

“Presidents day,” he said, “...best day to do it.”

I stood with my fresh mug of coffee on the stoop, I had just taken the rolled newspaper from his hand and, as I remember, we’d only been talking for a few minutes, mostly on trivial bullshit. But that final part caught me.

“Gonna be a big one, no holding back. Right at the town square. Everyone’ll see it for miles,” He didn’t meet my eyes when he said it. He seemed… not solemn, exactly. Just careful. Like he’d already had this conversation twice today and didn’t want a third person telling him he was exaggerating. “The sky will be *filled* with smoke, but I guess that doesn’t matter, it’ll clear eventually, always does.”

I was taken aback. 

“Uh,” I turned to place my coffee and the paper on the small table by the rocking chair, “Should I…be leaving now?”

He offered an innocent chuckle but muted it with his hand, and by the time he withdrew it from his mouth, all smiles had disappeared completely, “I mean, you’d be cutting it close,” he said, “but if it’s any consolation - staying here wouldn’t make much a difference to going anyway. Something that big? You ain’t missing it. Wouldn’t matter.”

He hissed air through his teeth and clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth. 

“Sooner I finish here, less of a chance I don’t get home. It’ll be gridlock downtown, ” He replied, fishing in his bulking rucksack for a fresh paper, turning in the direction of the neighbours, “better I spread the word though! Anyway, enjoy the show.”

He chuckled once more, dry and forced, and trailed off across the sidewalk. 

My grandfather, Jonathan Becks, was a fighter pilot in World War II. All throughout my life, from when I understood spoken English until his death in 2009, he told me tales about the war. Young me got the funny stories: jokes, routines, the little moments of being a kid in a man’s uniform.

Years later, when he got sicker and I got older, he opened up about the darkest parts of deployment. Things he’d sat alone with for decades. Confessions. The worst one -the most terrifying and visceral - was Nagasaki.

Not long after the blast, he flew over the city as part of the post-strike assessment. There were cameras on board for documenting the impact site. He told me he flew low. Low enough to see it wasn’t a city anymore, just a smudge against the landscape, an abscess of smoke and char. At that altitude he was spared no recourse from the devastation caused by his country: although he couldn’t see faces nor specifics, he could see clusters of the dead near the riverbanks, and the living walking without purpose or direction. He told me, “Pray you die in the blast, ‘cus afterwards, it’s nothin’ but agony, for everyone.”

I was in my early twenties when he told me the story, it must’ve been three weeks before he’d pass, and he spared no details. Not only from his experience but what his buddies told him, too: on-the-ground perspectives from citizens who’d been interviewed and tales of the ‘alligator people’ who were so badly maimed they could do nothing but crawl. 

The bomb had tormented my grandfather’s life.

The bomb quickly became a torment to me, too.

Teachers said I had a ‘good capacity to create my own worlds’ when I was younger - a pretty fucking convoluted way of saying I daydreamed too much. Unfortunately, on the day my grandfather confessed, that bad habit became a cancer that metastasised over my mind. Non-stop film reels of the attack. 

Thinking of the size of the blast;

The brightness of the blast;

The temperature of the blast. 

I would lay in bed next to my wife and imagine the rumble, the falling of glass in glittering shards, the scorch. Maybe it would be painless, sure, but that’s no guarantee. But I guess the mailman was right: in the end, it *“wouldn’t matter.”*

Nuclear armageddon is in 5 minutes.

My hands are still vibrating. 

I stare out over the humble skyline of Spokane. We were never a prominent name in urbanism; our tallest buildings would resemble cargo containers to the big cities, like New York. A bomb would crumple it like a sandcastle. 

The Bank of America Finance Center, our tallest and proudest monument to commerce, would surely pop like a zit from the initial shockwave. Glass would be shredded from the windows and rebar would erupt from the walls.

The Davenport Hotel would be a tin-can containing hundreds of people, kicked quite literally against the curb. But if the mailman was right, and it was due to the center-masse of our little city, my wife and I wouldn’t have been the ‘lucky ones’: radiation would come in droves and would kill us from the inside, turning intestine and kidney alike into pink pulp.

I couldn’t let that happen. Not to the woman I love. 

This rocking chair I sat on, gently careening backwards and forwards, was supposed to be where I sat with a son or daughter on my knee, answering their questions about how the world worked. My wife and I - we’d only recently looked at renovating the spare room into a nursery. Not pregnant yet but…preparation couldn’t hurt, right?

I snorted, bitterly. The most I did in that room was put up a shelf. 

Before I left the front door to sit out here, I’d snagged a pack of Marlboro Reds from the desk drawer in my office, where I’d kept them for emergencies. When I put them there though, I’d imagined ‘emergencies’ to consist of an argument with my wife or maybe an unpaid bill coming to bite me in the ass. A nuclear holocaust wasn’t exactly on the bingo cards. I guess I’ll be having two.

Flicking the box, every cigarette sat filter-up but one: my grandfather smoked like a chimney, it was what killed him, and he always flipped one cigarette to face the other way. Apparently, he’d picked it up from a marine he met. Well, I got into the practice of it too, a way to honour the old man.

I struggled to light it. Every finger had pin-and-needles, my index twitched and it made me drop the zippo flat onto my lap. The eventual huff of acrid smoke was like heaven, only for its cindering tip to remind me of what’s about to happen. I almost put it out. Almost.

Nuclear Armageddon is in 4 minutes.

There are a few sirens in the distance. Civil unrest must be rising in the city center, people clawing to get as far away as possible. I guess they didn’t understand how nukes work, but yet again, I’d done way more research into them than your average person.

They were trying to squander the only merit to their situation: proximity. They would be nothing but shadows on the pavement at such close range, many have died worse deaths than that. Instantaneous. That’s the way.

Taking another long pull of the cigarette, I flickered my eyes towards my shotgun  that I had stood against the windowpane, still entrenched in thought. I guess that was an instant way out, too: hell, I’d even taken the care of putting a second shell in the barrel.

Thinking over a nuclear blast event, so vividly and often, I found that I’d started to dramatise it all in my head. Everything got bigger on every little simulation in my mind. So, as it lay only minutes away, I found myself becoming more and more of a hypocrite. I was… morbidly fascinated with it and suicide felt like heresy. All of this fear, constantly revolving around hypotheticals, had eaten at me so much that when I was finally met with the opportunity to see it for myself, it felt as if I could finally put a face to a name. There’s no easy way of describing it: I just *needed* to experience it. 

My wife didn’t. She didn’t have the curiosity that I did. She didn’t experience the fear that I always had. 

I continue smoking. 

Nuclear Armageddon is in 3 minutes.

Finishing my cigarette, I put it out on my copy of *The Spokesman.* Half-folded, I could only make out the tips of today’s big title, and that’s all I really needed to see. News of the attack would have only become common knowledge an hour ago, and the mailman would have already been hurling these into laws and postboxes: nothing on that page would be of any value to me anymore. Keeping up with college football or the recent mayoral election felt so insignificant now.

The sirens were getting more plentiful - I figured that people were really starting to lose their shit now. The doors to public buildings were probably being shut in the faces of panicking crowds, aching to find shelter from the empty street, and the police were probably being swept up in the trampling masses as opposed to policing them. Poor bastards. Nobody asked for this.

Nuclear Armageddon is in 2 minutes.

As I stare out over Spokane, a cruiser begins to drive towards the street. Its lights flash and sirens carve up the silence that had reigned over Peacock Meadows since I'd come back out on the porch.

I continue to rock and reach into my pocket for that second cigarette.

Two officers emerge from the cruiser and, upon glancing the shotgun by my window, immediately seem apprehensive.

“Is al-o-st t-ighm!” I shout with the cig in my teeth, which melted my speech into a slew of vowels. Upon lighting it, I took it from my mouth, “Go home to your families.”

The two of them resemble a comedic duo: short and pudgy, taller and thin. From the passenger side, the shorter one wouldn’t dare step toward the curb, but the taller one walked closer with a hand resting near his belt. “We’re more worried about yours,” he said.

Nuclear Armageddon is in 1 minute.

I snort, sigh, and motion towards the firearm that they’re oh-so-scared of. 

“You don’t gotta worry about that,” I shout back at them, almost playful-like, as I once more continue to choke that smoke deeper into my lungs, “Look: you may not see it right now, but in sixty seconds, you’ll understand *why*.”

And if right on cue: a blip begins to swim across the skies from somewhere to the west. It looks like a gnat, a flea: ironic, the thing that kills me looks like it could be found crawling through the hairs of a housecat. The police keep calling out but my eyes stay glued firmly on the plane. It is so graceful. It twists and turns, elaborately threading the air until I notice the plumes of colour jetting out from behind it. 

At first, it looks like the regular steam.

But as I continue to focus, I can’t help but notice that it's red. The plane is spewing red shit. The plane coming to kill us all has red smoke coming from its tailend.

I have never been a Biblical man. Nobody in my family ever has. My grandfather gave up believing in the war and, thus, he didn’t give my mother much incentive to become a churchgoer. All this being said, I can’t help but see the correlation between the red smoke of the bomber and the lava soaked plains of Hell.

I guess it’s much too late to ask for a pardon from God. Not after what I did. I’d be down there, with the sinners and the wretches. I’ll be getting what I deserved. But, at least to me, I’ll know what I did was a kindness to somebody I loved.

Nuclear Armageddon is in 30 seconds.

The police. The street. The newspaper. The skyline. The plane. I shut it all out as I squeeze my eyes shut. The cigarette was no longer in my hands, I must’ve dropped it. I can still taste it. It coats my throat.

The light hitting my eyelids casts strange shapes and colours across my vision. It’s all mostly orange and red, big plumes and blotches. Soon it may turn white.

I’m counting down in my head the entire time now.

*19, 18, 17…*

Honestly, I think I’d live everything the same, if I get reincarnated. Down to every last detail. I’ve always lived as an honest, caring, kind person. I’ve always tried to do what's right for people, even if *they* didn’t know it.

*…14, 13, 12…*

I just realised, this entire time, I didn’t even tell you my wife’s name. It is, or it *was*, Josie. The only girl I ever loved, somebody beautiful, somebody empathetic. When you love as hard as I did, you’d wish your loved one would never have to endure any pain or hardship ever again. The very thought of it breaks you. You want them to be numb to all the bad in the world.

*…9, 8, 7…*

That’s why I did it.

Please, please understand. 

When we were younger, we had this dog who got a bad infection on its belly. Caught itself on a fence. My grandfather told me, after letting me say my goodbyes, that it's “better to help it not hurt than do nothing.” 

I was just trying to spare her from the blast. She didn’t know what I knew.

*…3, 2, 1…*

Suddenly, I was ejected from the rocking chair and flung into the small wooden table at my left. Coffee splashed against my back and, a second later, ceramic crunches as it hits the floor. My wrists are pinned against my back.

“-to control, we were responding to the 10-103, suspect has been apprehended-”

After a few seconds, I slowly peel my eyelids back up. The fat officer was the one to grab me, pinning me to the floor with a knee that dug into my spine. His partner, the tall one, took the shotgun and tossed it out into the yard across the grass. A few seconds later, that same officer opens the door to our home and walks inside.

From the radio that the little officer has on his shoulder, I hear the words of his partner, all tinny and crackly. His voice is shaking.

“-uh, reporting one female, they are D.O.A., I repeat - one deceased female, looks like- fuck, it looks like an gunshot wound to the back of her head-""

And his words bleed out as I crane my neck and turn to look away. White fragments of my mug litter around a central puddle of coffee that had stained the woodboards. This smear manages to catch the corners of that copy of *The Spokesman*, now flat across the ground with its title in booming letters. At the angle of reading it, seeing as my cheek was pressed to the floor, it took me a little longer to make out the words.

But I do:

‘PRESIDENTS DAY AIR SHOW: 6PM, RIVER PARK SQUARE.’

With my gut now in free-fall, my eyes darted around, desperate to catch something that proves I was right. That makes this all mean something. That it, the *bomb*, was happening. I only manage to catch glimpses of that plane careening over the skyline. 

There’s more of them now.

4 different aircraft in total.

They spin in formation and do loop-da-loops in perfect synchronisation.

They all have different colours of smoke. Red. Blue. Green. Yellow.

They use these trails to create patterns in the sky. Behind, I hear a huff of resignation.

“Alright,” the officer behind me says, “Up you come.”

He hoists me up by the arm.

An ambulance is here now, a stretcher clatters up the stoop where I’d stood this morning, coffee in hand, talking to the mailman.

*An Air Show*, I thought to myself - nausea rising, words turning to static.

1qovx75,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LegendsofYamkaizen/comments/1qovx75/quiet_part_three/,Quiet Part Three,"I stand on a wooden deck. An overcast sky hangs over me. I lean against the railing that leads to the fenced backyard; the grass is in the transitional period of fall lushness to winter dead. Newman stands next to me, arms crossed. He tilts his head to the dog at the bottom of the deck’s stairs. The brightest object here, a neon tennis ball, waits to be thrown. We’re in my Quiet Place—and it feels so good. 

	Newman, or Warren as he told me to refer to him as, decided to finally do what we should’ve done two months ago: visit each other’s Quiet Places. I volunteered first. I’ll take any excuse to drop out of the real world and spend some time here. I go down the stairs, grab the ball, and throw it to the yard’s border. Dolly chases it in a dash. She’s a forty-mile and hour missile when she isn’t lounging on the cushioned outdoor bench. Far off to the periphery, the soft rumble of sparse passing traffic fills the silence. 

	“Why just half a house?” asks Warren, as he fails to open the sliding door. 

	“Well, I didn’t want it to just be the deck and yard. Wanted a façade of at least half the house for the ascetics. To keep up the illusion that I’m here.”

	Dolly brings back the ball. I give her plenty of pets, cherishing her silky caramel fur. Animals can be present in Quiet Places without the fear of getting Loud. They aren’t aware enough to realize they’re not real. However, it is advised in the pamphlet not to create crows, parrots, pigs, tortoises, deer, or dolphins. Those are bright enough to put the pieces together. Warren told me of a case he was on where he had shot macaws out of the sky. ‘It rained rainbow feathers that day,’ he told me. A part of me would prefer the animal cases rather than the human or humanoid ones. Animals can be crafty, but they lack the dark pit that mortal kind possesses. But this is no place to think about such things. Here I can play fetch with Dolly and give Warren the occasional chirp of conversation. 

	“Looks like our time is up,” says Warren, cupping one of his ears. “Phone’s ringing.” 

	“Understood,” I say, dropping the ball. Dolly reaches her paw up to me, eyes begging. I hold it. “Don’t worry, Dolly, I’ll be back soon.” 

	And I will. Work ends in an hour. All I have to do when I get home is feed myself, and I can spend the rest of the night before bed here, where it’s quiet and I’m left all alone. 

	I pull us back into reality. Warren was meant to bring me in today, but duty calls. Most people call into my branch at the PSF for information regarding Quiet Places. Some make requests for pamphlets, others make appointments for registration, or they call for information. Warren’s voice breaks through the idle chatter and calls a few cubicles down from me. My phone begins to ring. Unhooking it, I put on my best customer service voice. 

	“PSF Quiet Office, how may I help you?” 

	Honestly, I’ll take this work over the field work any day. No blood, no fear, and no deer. I never want to see one of those things ever again. Now that the forest is marked off-limits, my chances of an encounter have dropped immensely. I end the call after fulfilling a mail request for pamphlets. The phone rings again. 

	“PSF Quiet Office, how may I help you?” 

	“Oh, hi! Yes, yes, I’m looking for information,” says the voice behind the phone, male by the sounds of it. 

	“What kind of info do you need, sir?” 

	“What are your… I think public hours?” 

	“Public hours end at five pm, so you’re more than welcome to visit our offices tomorrow,” I say. 

	“If that’s the case, hmm, who would I need to speak to about making an appointment?” asks the man. Eesh, what does this guy want? 	

	“If it’s for Quiet Place-related purposes, I can set you up with one of our admins?” 

	“Not for a Quiet reason.” 

	“I’ll transfer you to admin,” I say, transferring the call to 101. 

	Soon, six o’clock hits, and I’m clocked out for the day. Spent my lunch hour at the gym, so I don’t need to do my mandatory exercise after hours. I can swing right to home! I pass by Warren and give him my goodbyes. He gives me a lazy wave. Progress in my opinion. 

	As I reach the main hall, I walk by the circular open office of the admin team. Gabriella is the only one left here. She’s nice, we share a birthday too; shared a box of donuts last year. I’m thinking of a healthier treat this year. Maybe chocolate-covered strawberries? 

	“Got a weird guy at the end there. You end up talking to him?” I ask. 

	“Oh, you transferred someone over? I didn’t get the call light,” says Gabriella. 

	“Hmm, weird. Well, not our problem. See you tomorrow!”

	“See ya then!”

	I swipe my keycard and move through the turnstile to the main doors. Why make all that fuss over getting over here is he wasn’t going to make an appointment? He’ll probably show up in person during visiting hours. Now enough of thinking about work. I have an appointment of my own to attend to. 

	As I make my way to the doors, I always make sure to load my gun. There’s some heavy foot traffic tonight. Sometimes I forget that there are plenty of real dangers rather than imaginary ones. Even as I make my way to the parking garage, the usual sketchy folk are already out, ready to run amok. Silent, still figures loiter against bare walls. Others wear their hood too far over their heads. Sometimes I keep a few spaces unloaded in my revolver. Just in case some of them aren’t real. You never know who might’ve slipped between the cracks. 

	My dishwasher works on some freshly used dishes as I sit in the corner of my bedroom. The rocking chair gently swings me back and forth as I drift off into my Quiet Place. Dolly waits for me in there. Her tail wags, tongue out, ready to play. It’s as if I never left in the first place. The open back yard, overcast skies, and soft winds beat my cramped apartment in every way. After an hour of fetch, Dolly and I are worn out. We lay on my cushions. I stroke her fur. Every time I move my hand away, Dolly nestles her head closer to me. Her paw sticks straight up at me. Sometimes she knocks me in the chin with it. I take a nice deep breath of rural air. I check my watch; it’s getting to be that time. Doesn’t matter, I’m quick at getting ready in the morning. I’ll have plenty of time to be here before work. 

	“Alright, Dolly, I’ll see you later tonight,” I rub the dog’s face and pull myself back into my chair. 

	City noise overtakes my senses as I reorient myself. It was time for work. The drive to my PSF site isn’t far. The walk from the parking garage to the main buildings feels longer than the drive itself. I swipe myself in. Gabriella isn’t in yet. She comes in at noon. Not many people show up at eight. Most arrive at nine or ten. I reach the elevator to head to my branch. Before the doors can even open, a voice breaks the comfortable silence. 

	“Don’t even bother, we’re called in for a case,” says Warren. 

	I turn to him. He’s holding two cups of coffee, one of which he reached out to me. 

	“Thank you. This is quite kind of you,” I say. 

	“I thought I’d be nicer. I’m too old for enemies,” says Warren. 

	“You’re far from an enemy. You’re too real,” I banter back. 

	“Coin flip for who drives?” 

	“It’s winter, let’s use your car.”

	“I didn’t say flip for which car, it’s for who’s driving it.” 

	I call for tails. 

	Lands heads. 

	Damn.

as my unemployment was running down i swallowed my pride got a bar job. i hit the block and passed out physical resumes until one place asked me to come back. recently though they let me go because business is slow. if you don’t count the bar job (which was super part time) im sitting around 9 months unemployed. it’s at the point where potential employers will start questioning the gap.

i’ve been sifting thru craigslist and interviewing places but it’s absolutely brutal. even for line cook and foh positions they want multiple rounds and a stage shift. i was even rejected for a barista position! my friend was a manager and gave me the questions in advance, i prepped good answers and came in prepared. truly feeling stuck here. what am i supposed to do? insane to be experiencing this while the US seemingly collapses on itself. feels like i was robbed of my future and anyway to he back into my field.

I decided to try a new coffee shop in town and that’s where all the pain began. I typically only order a 16oz iced latte or matcha, or even chai. And the coffee isn’t everyday. But on Friday I was like yolo and ordered 24oz drink. It was an iced banana nut bread latte with oat milk and vegan banana cloud top. Also a strawberry short cake pop tart. Either that coffee or pastry gave me pain. I remember eating only 1/4 of the pastry and my stomach started hurting a few hours later. Bad cramping. Feeling like I wanna die. I felt relief after I went to the bathroom. But the next day, I thought it would be safe to get matcha latte with coconut milk. Wrong. Same thing happened a few hours later. I’ve been following a very bland diet since Saturday and no caffeine at all since Sunday. Yesterday I ate some pretzels because I thought those are bland. The amount of pain I had after was horrible. And I had so much cramping and diarrhea. So today I tried gluten free crackers as a snack and I’m having cramping again. The only things so far that don’t hurt me are banana, white rice, chicken broth, and eggs. Sourdough is sometimes ok, sometimes it hurts me. So basically been in pain since Friday.

Valentine’s Day gifts don’t have to be serious. Sometimes the best ones are the ones that make you laugh so hard it hurts. I ran across a couple of gifts this year that make you spit out your coffee lol.

### Toilet Mug
Yep, it’s exactly what it sounds like. A coffee mug shaped like a toilet. Perfect for that friend or partner who appreciates questionable humor. Morning coffee will never be the same.

### Disappearing Coffee Mug
This one is magical and slightly terrifying. Pour in hot liquid and the design disappears to reveal a hidden image underneath. Bonus points if it’s something ridiculous or shocking. The reaction is always priceless.

Both of these are guaranteed to get a laugh and steal the show at any gift exchange. Pair them with a normal gift if you want, or just let them shine on their own.

The town hadn’t changed. The gas station still hummed under tired fluorescent lights. The diner windows reflected the streets like black water. But the quiet had deepened, as if it had been holding its breath since the last of them left.

Blake had never gone anywhere. While the rest of them scattered. College towns, cities, marriages, children. Blake stayed. He moved from job to job, renting rooms, orbiting a place that slowly forgot how to look at him.

His death was ruled an accident.

No one believed it.



They intended to leave after the funeral. A night became two. Two became several. No one said why.

Brad took a room at the bed and breakfast on Main Street. Dustin stayed at his parents’ house. Stella returned to her childhood bedroom, surrounded by the ghosts of a smaller self she had once been. Megan and Stacy shared a motel room near the highway, the kind meant for people passing through. They could have stayed at Stella’s family home. Stacy was, after all, Stella’s younger sister but the bed was never going to be big enough for two, and Stella had insisted they keep some distance.

During the day, they met cautiously, careful to speak in neutral tones. Coffee. Lunches half-eaten. Polite questions about work, houses, children. Each answer seemed too easy, too rehearsed.

Stacy listened. She always had.



The first thing happened to Megan.

It started small, in the mirror over the sink. Not a face. Almost a face. Something watching, behind her eyes. When she turned, it was gone. 

That night she dreamt of a house she recognised but had never entered. Empty rooms, blackened walls, the faint smell of smoke still clinging to the air.

Brad saw something next. A figure in the dark of his room, wrong in proportion, watching him sleep. Dustin caught a reflection smiling when he wasn’t. They began whispering in fragments, the fear growing in them before they could name it.

Only Stacy saw nothing.

“You’re wound too tight,” she said gently. “You came back. That stirs things up.”

Megan did not answer. She was trembling.



That night, in the motel room, Megan sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the carpet.

“Baby,” Stacy said softly, moving closer, “talk to me. You’re scaring me.”

Megan swallowed, voice thin. “You remember John?”

Stacy frowned. “The kid who died in the house fire? Everyone talked about it for months.”

Megan nodded. “It was our fault.”

The room felt suddenly.. small.

“What do you mean?” Stacy asked. “It was an accident.”

“No,” Megan said. “That night, you wanted to come. We didn’t let you. Brad hated him. He had firecrackers. He threw one through an open window. It happened so fast. I didn’t think, none of us did. We couldn’t do anything. We just… ran.”

Stacy was silent for a moment.

Then she laughed.

It wasn’t Stacy’s laugh.

It came out low, slow, curling like smoke in a cold room.

“You ran?” it said, wearing Stacy’s voice. “Seems like you never stopped.”

Megan stared at the face that wasn’t her girlfriend.

“You’re not—” she gasped.

The thing smiled.

Megan ran.

She didn’t make it far.

The next morning, the real Stacy found her.

The motel room smelled stale. Megan’s shoes lay where she had kicked them. The bathroom light was still on.

The closet door was closed.

Inside, Megan hung. Knees bent, toes brushing the carpet. The belt she had used for her luggage now held her suspended.

The police called it a suicide.

Stacy did not cry. She did not touch her. She only felt the weight of not understanding.



That night, the group gathered at Stella and Stacy’s childhood home.

Brad didn’t sit. Dustin paced. Stella looked hollow, her eyes wide with fear.

“There’s something you need to know,” Brad said.

They told Stacy about John.

The firecrackers. The open window. The flames climbing faster than they expected. The way they had run. The silence that followed.

Blake had stayed behind, carrying it all alone.

“And now he’s dead,” Dustin said. “And Megan too.”

Brad swallowed. “We think it’s connected.”

Stacy felt her stomach twist.

“You think *what* is connected?” she asked.

Brad hesitated. “We don’t know. But something’s happening. Blake first. Then Megan. Shadows. Faces. Watching.”

Stacy shook her head. “Megan never said anything.”

Stella looked at her sister. “She might not have had time.”

Stacy’s stomach twisted with cold fury. “You left him. And then you left town. All of you.”

No one denied it.



Brad died next. A loose railing. A long fall.

Dustin followed. Carbon monoxide. Another death that seemed natural, except for the timing.

Stacy’s fear sharpened. It was no longer grief. It was dread.

*They’re coming for you too, Stella,* she thought.

She tried to keep her sister close. She made her sleep in the same room. She watched over her like a hawk. But whatever haunted them did not need to be seen to kill.



The final night came quietly, the kind of quiet that tastes wrong.

Stacy was in the kitchen when she heard screaming from Stella’s room. She ran. The door swung open to emptiness. Nothing moved. Nothing breathed.

Stella thrashed, fighting the air as if something invisible pressed against her.

“Stella!” Stacy shouted.

The screams cut off abruptly. A *smash*.

The bedroom window shattered.

Stella went straight through it, limbs flailing. She did not trip. She did not stumble. It looked as if something had pushed her.

Stacy could do nothing. She could only stare at her sister’s body lying motionless in the moonlight.



Stacy left town shortly after Stella’s funeral.

She carried the knowledge with her: what had really happened, who had been guilty, who had been spared. She had been innocent. She had not been part of it. But she had to hold it anyway.

Whatever had haunted them stayed behind, finally sated.

Stacy did not look back.

I recently enjoyed a coffee from a Mahlkönig Grinder and so it somehow got my attention.

Fortunately, they released some years ago the first home version, the X54.

Because it's still not as popular in the home segment as Eurekas, Niche  etc., the demand on the used market is not as big, so I am keeping my eyes open for a Mahlkönig.

  
I have noticed that 2024 ( Another reddit post states late 2024) they have released the second version of the x54. So my question is to the users and owners of the X54 V2 - how to spot the difference between the versions? is it labeled on the box?   
From a quick research only the hopper is smaller - but sometimes it is hard to tell from a photo.

Would be grateful for some advice. Also would be nice to know how the experience feels witgh the V2. is there someone who had a direct comparison with the V1?

I read that the burrs and motor have been updated - how is it noticable?

I'd be super grateful for any tips on **how to reliably spot a V2** (display differences? ? Grind speed test?). I really want that improved motor and burrs!

Thanks a ton in advance for any insights! ☕

**Cup Characteristics**: The green coffee has a very fermented aroma. Roasted, there are aromas of toast, yeast, coffee fruit and ripe melon. Very pronounced fruit. Flavors of melon, papaya, both skewed toward the ripe to overripe range. Additionally, notes of barley, pecan, cherry cordial, tobacco, tangerine and sun-dried tomato.

This situation has been living in my head and I honestly need outside perspective.

I met this woman at my gym around August. We started talking casually, became friendly, and began hanging out. Late August, she told me she was going through a divorce and that she and her husband were separated. I didn’t believe her at first — it felt unreal, almost like a line someone would use to justify stepping out of a relationship. I remember thinking, *there’s no way this is real.*

Despite my doubts, we kept talking. We went on low-key dates (coffee, Panera, etc.). I never made a move until December, which I now realize was me wasting time and not being direct.

In October, she told me she had a crush on another guy from the gym. I didn’t think much of it at the time and assumed she was either joking or trying to make me jealous. Around this same period, I caught her lying about being in nursing school — she later admitted she was only taking prerequisite classes. That added to my distrust and made me question everything she said.

By November, I kept asking whether anything had happened with the gym guy. She repeatedly told me no. But her body language and behavior around him felt off — flustered, overly friendly, almost nervous. Still, she insisted nothing had happened.

In December, I finally tried to make a move. She rejected it, but what confused me most is that she *never* distanced herself afterward. She didn’t cut contact, didn’t block me, didn’t disappear — she kept me firmly in the friend zone while still staying in my life. That’s where things really started not adding up for me.

Fast forward: things faded out, then suddenly exploded.

I was shown **screenshots of messages** between the gym guy and another woman. The messages were chaotic, vulgar, competitive, and emotionally charged — basically two people arguing over the same man, accusing him of lying, seeing multiple women at once, and not being honest with either of them. There were also conversations about health concerns and trust issues, which honestly disturbed me.

What stood out was how real and unfiltered the messages were. This didn’t look like something fabricated for attention — it looked messy, emotional, and raw. The woman sending the screenshots claimed she believed she was exclusive with him, only to slowly realize she wasn’t. She also claimed she later found out *he had been seeing my gym friend during the same time.*

That’s when everything spiraled.

Around the same time, the woman I originally knew from the gym came back into my life, telling me that the gym guy’s “girlfriend” was harassing her and sending her messages. At that point, I genuinely didn’t know what to believe anymore. Between the lies about school, the vague divorce situation, and now this chaos, I assumed the separation story was fake and that her husband had no idea what was going on.

I made a decision I regret: I anonymously emailed her husband screenshots, believing I was exposing something he didn’t know.

His response completely blindsided me.

He replied calmly and directly, saying they *are* separated, that reality isn’t what I think it is, and that I should move on. He ended by saying that negative energy comes back around and wished me luck.

That email shook me.

Because if what he said is true — then she wasn’t lying. She *was* separated. She *did* tell me the truth from the very beginning, and I spent months assuming manipulation where there may not have been any.

Now I’m sitting with a lot of uncomfortable realizations:

* I didn’t trust her even when she was honest
* I stayed passive instead of either stepping up or walking away
* I got pulled into drama that wasn’t even mine
* And I may have crossed a serious boundary by involving her husband unnecessarily

I’m genuinely shocked and speechless that her story checked out in the end.

So my questions are:

* Was she telling the truth the entire time and I just projected doubt because the situation felt unreal?
* Or was this simply a chaotic situation where *everyone* (including me) handled things poorly?
* And how do you even process something like this without becoming bitter or paranoid going forward?

I’m not looking for validation — just clarity so I don’t repeat this kind of situation again.

I'm torn between 3 different machines and would like some advice on what you think would be best. I'm based in Adelaide, Australia.  

My wife and I drink primarily espresso/long black and I think we've only used the milk steamer on our Brevile maybe 30 times total in the past 10 years. So a dual boiler is not really a requirement for us. We're light roast people, and the machine in our house does approx 4-5 espressos a day. The machine will very rarely used to do back to back for more than 2 coffees at a time. 

In terms of experience level, I'd still classify myself as an inexperienced enthusiast. I would like to get a bit more into it, but also want something that can be quick when needed and still be good. 

The three machines I'm stuck on are the Profitec Go, The Ascaso Dream PID and the Ascaso Steel Uno PID. Local prices ranging from 2199-2799. The Profitec Go being the cheapest of the 3, the Dream PID being the most expensive. As basic as it is, I do really like the Yellow of the Profitec and the Dream. The Dream looks good, but the lift out design and small drip tray really detracts me from it. The Uno looks like a good balance but doesn't have the colour.

Does the lact of a programmable pre-infusion really hold the Profitec Go back?

Short version? You don’t need to overthink it.

If you want reliable, easy, and repairable, the Baratza Encore is still the safest bet. The grind quality is consistent, parts are easy to replace, and these things last forever. If you want a noticeable bump in performance, swapping in the M2 burr (the same one used in the Virtuoso) basically turns it into a Virtuoso for way less money. That’s what I’d do. It’s a simple upgrade and makes a real difference.

Static and mess? The quick fix is a tiny spritz of water on the beans before grinding. Sounds silly, but it’s a total game changer and keeps grounds from flying everywhere. Noise-wise, most electric grinders are going to make some sound, but the Encore is pretty reasonable.

If quiet and clean design matter more, the Fellow Ode Gen 2 is excellent and noticeably quieter, but it usually pushes past the $300 mark unless you find a deal. For pure budget, the OXO conical burr grinder is surprisingly solid, consistent, and easy to live with.

Personally, I’d grab an Encore, do the M2 burr upgrade, and call it a day. Simple, dependable, and great coffee. What would you go with, and why?

I'm 18, and I'm 5 weeks post operation. They had to remove my right tube.

So I work at a coffee shop. The landlord chose not to clean the snow for us despite us opening today so I decided ""I hate how unsafe the back is and it's the only way I'm getting into the coffee shop. So i shoveled a path which took about an hour and thirty minutes. I took small breaks in between, lifted with my legs rather than my back and didn't lift anything I couldn't. I'm home now and all of sudden feeling pain in my pelvic area and where I got the tube removed. I don't know if this means I need to go to the hospital or my body is reacting the workout of moving close to 13 inches of snow on my own.

I'm not good with health anxiety and I've never gotten surgery before. It's not just my stomach that's sore and achy, my back is and so are my arms. But I'm worried I may have done something wrong and need to get checked out. I did it because I wanted to, not because I was asked too. I figured I'm going back to work tomorrow and I don't want to get stuck in the snow again so let me clear it up to make it easier for my coworker and I.

I need some advice. Or any sort of tell tale signs that I did the most and just re-opened where they did the surgery. It only hurts when I stretch my back and sit down. When I'm up and moving it doesn't bother me.",1,1769558760.0,EctopicSupportGroup,2,1.0,False

1qovaw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1qovaw0/the_next_best_author/,The Next Best Author,"The mountain didn’t have a name on maps, but everyone nearby called it the Spine. It rose out of the forest like a broken vertebra, stone ribs jutting through pine and fog. Nothing lived long on its slopes, at least, nothing that stayed human, except one person. Uncle Elric did.


His cabin squatted at the tree line where the forest thinned, and the rock began. Smoke curled from the chimney year-round. Traps hung from nails. Claw marks scarred the doorframe, some old enough to be gray with age, others fresh enough to still remember blood.


Down in the towns, his brother told stories about him. The nephew heard them first-hand from his dad, whispering late at night like warnings dressed as entertainment. Those kinds of stories keep you from wandering out late at night as a child. 


“Your uncle lives alone because he has to. Things come down from the mountain. He keeps them away from us.” The father always said it proudly.


In the stories, the monsters had names—half-remembered ones, forbidden to be said. Antlered things that walked on two legs. Shapes that peeled themselves out of shadows. Sometimes voices called from the forest, but nobody had seen them except Uncle Elric. Always, there was Uncle Elric, standing between the forest and the rest of the world.


The boy grew up loving those stories.


He grew up using them.


By the time he was thirty, he’d turned them into books. Bestsellers, according to his publisher. Horror novels with dramatic covers and clever prose. The uncle became a character—bigger, wilder, almost mythic. A lone woodsman battling metaphorical demons. A symbol. A brand. The nephew gave interviews where he smiled and said, “I’ve always been fascinated by folklore.” He still had never visited the mountain or his uncle.


Elric read one of the books once. Someone left it at the ranger station. He didn’t finish it. When his nephew finally showed up, he arrived clean. City-clean. Expensive boots without mud. A notebook tucked under his arm like a shield. “I need authenticity,” the nephew said, grinning as he stepped out of the truck. “You know. Inspiration.” His uncle looked at him for a long moment. Not at his face—at his hands. Soft. Unscarred.


“You wrote lies about me,” His uncle said.


“They’re stories, you know that better than anyone,” the nephew replied. “And they’re good ones. People love them. I’m—” He hesitated, then smiled wider. “—the next best author, according to some.” That smile sealed it.


“You know what? Stay the night,” Elric said energetically. “See what you’re writing about.”


The forest swallowed the light early. By dusk, the trees pressed close, and the Spine loomed above them like something waiting to exhale. The nephew asked questions as they ate next to the fire—about symbolism, about fear, about whether the monsters were real or just a way of processing isolation. “I mean they’re really just bears and mountain lions, right?”


Elric didn’t answer.


When the first sound came from the mountain, the nephew laughed.


“Great ambiance,” he said, already scribbling. “Do you hear that? It’s like—”


The scream cut him off. High and wrong and close enough to rattle the windows.


The uncle was on his feet instantly, rifle in hand.


“Inside,” he said suddenly.


The creatures came down with the dark. Like they always did. Shapes broke from the tree line. There were too many. One crawled sideways ahead of the pack, head bent backward so its mouth faced the sky. Another mimicked the nephew’s voice perfectly. “Uncle?!” it called. “Uncle, help!”


His nephew was frozen in the window of the cabin now.


He saw his uncle fighting—steel and fire against claws and hunger. The man moved with brutal efficiency, every motion practiced. He killed what he could. He drove the rest back long enough to breathe. But the mountain wanted more. Something hit the cabin wall hard enough to crack the logs. Hands and claws burst through a window. His nephew screamed as they grabbed him, the notebook falling open to a blank page. “Wait—wait—UNCLE!” he shouted as he was dragged toward the trees. Elric reached him once. Just once. Their eyes met in the firelight as he pulled hard on his arms, hearing the sound of bones pop.


“I’m sorry!” Elric yelled, losing grip as his nephew was ripped from his hands screaming. Then the dark took the nephew whole, the sound of cracking bones and howls almost drowning out his screams.


Morning came thin and gray. The ranger arrived first, then the police. They asked questions, took notes, and stared too long at the claw marks and blood leading into the woods before deciding not to follow them.


“So,” one officer said carefully, “you broke your one rule, did you?” He sat down slowly next to Elric on his porch. Elric nodded, holding the notebook his nephew dropped. 


“Why?” The ranger was looking at him puzzled while handing him a cup of coffee.


“He needed to know the truth. I thought he would learn. Maybe then he would write the real story.” He kept his solemn eyes towards the mountains while he sipped the hot coffee.


The ranger shifted uncomfortably. “That's right, your nephew was… a writer, right?”


Uncle Elric and the men looked up at the top of the mountain, where the fog still hadn’t lifted.

I am hoping people can point out mistakes, and explain them if possible. To gauge where I'm at with this, before I try a layout and prototype.

My goal with this design is to wire the PCB to the original controls of my cars radio from 1980, while upgrading its features. I've tried to generously give myself more exposed pins than needed for future use on other cars with different radio setups.

The RS-485 is supposed to send data to a separate future PCB.

The Preamp will likely need to be on a completely separate PCB, to be housed by the cassette deck and not cause noise with the rest of the unit.

final note, I'm also stuck at the moment how I can include the AM radio and receive the signal off the same antenna. The datasheet show the AM and FM ran off two separate external antennas.

She doesn’t really know anyone in class and we ended up talking one day after lecture. She actually offered me her number herself, which caught me off guard.

After that, we texted mostly about school. She was friendly, responsive, used playful language, and even sent me old midterm material to help me study. In class, she sat next to me, walked with me for about 10 minutes after lecture, showed me a shortcut to my next class, and was generally nice and comfortable around me. She even asked about what kind of job I have and joked about wanting to travel Europe with me.

At the same time, everything stayed very “safe.” No personal compliments (besides her saying good things about my writing), no initiative outside of school stuff. When I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee one day this week, she replied kindly but said she couldn’t this week and didn’t suggest another time. she exactly said ""I won’t be able to this week, I’ll let you know if anything changes though :/ ""

1qov605,https://www.reddit.com/r/olivegarden/comments/1qov605/fired/,Fired,"I left work a few weeks ago on a busy Saturday night. Said goodbye to everyone. No issues. I get along with everyone. 

Went into work Sunday morning with donuts and coffee for the morning crew and get called into the office. Someone said I made a sexual harassing remark about them. Never did. I used to be in restaurant management I just got this job because I wanted to get my foot in the door with Darden. I know exactly what can be said or not said to people. I understand liability and not to mention I’m not stupid. I’ve learned after 15 years in this industry to never say anything to anyone you wouldn’t want repeated. 

Anyways I get a call the next day and I’m fired after being investigated. They changed the story multiple times. First it was one person I allegedly said this to. Then all of a sudden I said it to a group of people. They took statements from said people. I’m pretty sure I know the little click that did it.  That being said, I have numerous messages from people that work there both from FOH/BOH house saying “I can’t believe that you got fired for something like that I’ve never heard you say anything even kind of dirty.” 

They accused me of saying I wanted to give oral sex to another male employee. (I’m gay). 

I literally was just employee of the month and on track to be a trainer. My GM loved me and said it was out of her hands that ER made the decision. She also casually let slip that she believed me completely after whoever was in the room with her on the call left the office. 

So, other people can just make something up and line up their stories to be similar and they take that as evidence but not other people vouching for your character? I lost my job literally overnight. I even thought there’s no way they’re going to believe this shit I’ve never once been accused of anything in that way EVER in any job. Then bam. 

I had people request to work with me. I helped everyone out. I ran everyone’s food. I’d help not just stand there and talk. I’d clean. I enjoyed my job and the people. I’m disheartened that a company can just do that and not even give you a chance to defend yourself. They claim they did. No they made me write a statement that morning I got called to the office before the investigation even took place. 

Everything happens for a reason. I’m sure something better will come along but damn does the corporate culture suck there. 

The manager that had to talk to me in the office that morning is one of the best managers I’ve worked for and I adore her and we became close. She was visibly upset  telling me I had to be sent home pending investigation. And was also shocked that it even happened. 

Oh well, I hope they enjoyed the Box of Joe and doughnuts. 

Onward to better things. 

Note: I didn’t realize that Darden had huge lawsuits about sexual harassment. So again, I understand the liability thing from a business standpoint and shutting things down even if it’s something small but doesn’t change the fact I didn’t do anything I was accused of.

Made some modifications to the image to make it easier to connect to Janus via the device.

First: Open up the new version of Janus and then (ensuring BT is on), turn the gateway on so the application is waiting

Then: Just open up the Mercury plugin on the Carthing and press ""Connect"", and you should see the Janus app showing it's connected and shortly after that, the Mercury plugin showing it's connected as well.

Then, just play music on your phone from whatever app and if you navigate to the Now Playing plugin on the Carthing, it should display the track information.

There are a lot of features related to Spotify I've been adding that are only partially working at the moment, the base functionality for the application and such should work properly.

Rivers of Fire
When I was two I took a book of matches out to a grassy field behind our garage and promptly proceeded to burn the whole field down. It took every fire engine from both municipal townships to keep the fire from burning across Mr. Bliss's field of corn stubble to the tinder-dry hardwood thickets along the banks of Princeton's Lake Carnegie. I don't remember anything about it, but I do think it left me with a deep seated fear of fire that even now, some forty 60 years later, I still carry with me.

I have a hard time leaving my house, say for a fast trip down to the hardware store, without stopping first to sweep the non-existent dust away from the hearth of my woodstove in winter. And on my return trip, as I round the corner at the top of the hill, I can't resist stretching my neck to get a better view of my roof as it first appears, just to make sure that flames aren't leaping from the edges of the chimney. These aren't rational responses I know, but that's just the point.

 
And so it was, in the early afternoon of the 23rd of July when my father and I first rounded the corner on a high, prairie ridge in Yellowstone Park last summer, when we first saw the smoke. We were driving toward our favorite spot in Montana to fish a meandering, meadowy section of a cutthroat creek that Colin (my father) and I had been fishing every summer for nearly twenty years. And there was no mistaking the source of the smoke. Where we were going was where it was coming from. I could feel the muscles at the base of my neck tighten up just thinking about it. We hadn't had much snow in Montana for about four years in a row, and the forests had become progressively drier each season.

""Do you realize how dry it is,"" I said?

""I hope that smoke isn't drifting back down the valley,"" said Colin. ""My asthma won't take it.""

 As we emerged from the head of a small canyon just past the turnoff to the Slough Creek campground, I could see a steady breeze blowing the smoke eastward, up and over the ridges and high plateaus to the north of Stirrup Mountain. The air in the valley itself was still clear. Colin wouldn't have any trouble fishing as long as the wind didn't change. We pulled off onto a gravely turnout at the east end of the meadow and climbed out of the car to stretch our legs and look things over.

It was an incredible sight. A herd of Bison surrounded a pair of elaborately outfitted fly fishermen who were working both ends of what Colin and I have always referred to as the President's pool. And about three or four miles past the far side of the valley, from somewhere up a steep, heavily forested canyon, an evil mushroom stem of gray, blue, purple-orange and black smoke rose straight up into the trade winds about a thousand feet over the tops of mountains and then dispersed eastward in a massive, swirling smear of confusion. It wasn't a big fire yet, but it was a hot one. A noisy Park Service helicopter was thumping over our heads, canting itself into the wind, chopping its way across the smoky valley toward the source of the fire.

The water was lower than either of us had ever seen it before. At a time when this little creek should still have been bank-full, the water was clear as tepid tapwater, and there was hardly enough of it to drown a mouse. I wanted to run down the road and grab someone. To shake them by the shoulders and yell at them. The Park Service and their late 1960's back-to-nature-let-it-burn policy was going to incinerate the whole park on a year like this. Nobody seemed to realize what was going on!

Colin and I looked at each other several times without saying anything. ""I hope they know what they're doing,"" said Colin.

""They'd better put this one out right now,"" I said, ""or it'll burn through to Dead Indian pass before the end of the summer.""

After a quick conference Colin decided to fish downstream, to fish the Two Lonesome Cottonwoods pool, and to stay close to the highway in case the wind shifted. I like to move a lot faster than Colin does, and he gets mad if I fish out ahead of him, so I decided to take my waders off and strike out across the valley, to head upstream toward the source of the fire. It was warm enough to wet wade, and I could cover a lot more ground with sneakers on.

The water was low all right, but it was still quite cool, and the fish were as bright and healthy and hungry as they could be. They were so obviously concentrated in what little deep water there was, at the heads of the pools and at the bends of the ox bows, that the fishing was as good-or as easy-as I'd ever seen it before.

As I moved upstream, often walking and casting simultaneously, only slowing down to fish seriously at the best looking banks, I had to laugh at my circumstances: I wanted to slow down and relax, to take in my surroundings and enjoy the most intensely beautiful day I had seen in a year or more, but I found myself becoming increasingly agitated and less interested in the fishing. My eyes kept drifting southward and upward to the source of the smoke and the flames.

I realized I was being drawn southward by a powerful and irresistible force. Like a schoolboy chasing fire engines on a bicycle; I wanted to see the fire.

I also began to notice how remarkably dry and overworked this valley had become.

Back in the early 1960's, when Colin and I first started fishing here, approximately two hundred bison and somewhere between three and four thousand elk inhabited the northern portions of Yellowstone Park. In order to control their numbers in the absence of any natural predators, the Park Service employed trained government hunters to shoot large numbers of these animals during the coldest part of the winter.

It was a controversial policy from its inception, but it seemed to be a successful one, because the riparian range lands were in prime shape.

But jealous hunters and vocal animal rights groups had raised such a fuss that the shooting was discontinued, and the herds have mushroomed ever since, until now, in the late 1980's, the northern Yellowstone Bison herd is estimated at nearly nine hundred individuals, and the elk herd, depending on who's counting, at anywhere from twenty to thirty thousand!

And for the first time since we'd been coming here I noticed large numbers of purple headed bull thistles cropping up through the tall grasses. And not just a scattering of individuals, but whole fields of thistles taking over prime grasslands along the banks of the river. The northern valleys in Yellowstone Park were starting to look like the overgrazed cow pastures along the banks of the Gallatin River near Four Corners.

""This must be why they're so anxious to reintroduce the wolf,"" I thought. ""It's the only way the Park Service can control these herds and still hang on to the idea of a natural ecosystem.""

In order to avoid wading through a long stretch of poor fishing where the river drains over a hard, smooth bedrock bottom at the base of a cliff, I cut diagonally across a boggy, willow-choked section of bottom land toward a string of deep pools and good fishing I knew about a little further upstream.

I was hunched over and walking backwards-watching the tip of my rod while plowing through the willows-when I suddenly burst out into a small clearing and nearly ran into a crazed Bison.

Early in the summer, when the sun is at its hottest and when the deer flies and the horse flies are at their worst, a few of the biggest, orneriest, most dominant bull Bison drift off from the herds to stake out a territory and build a dust wallow where they'll often stand and snort for weeks at a time, baking their brains in the hot sun, rolling on their backs, pawing the ground and getting meaner by the minute.

Stomping and snorting, swishing his tail in a great cloud of finely sifted ochre-colored dust and buzzing horse flies, this ton and a half behemoth wasn't even aware of my presence, and I wanted to keep it that way.

I was cut off by the cliffs to my left, by an impenetrable thicket to my right, and by an agitated, dangerously lunatic Bison in front. My only choices were to backtrack through the willows-and to wade straight upstream through the barren bedrock riffles-or to abandon the river altogether, for a mile or more, and to head out across the prairie to the mouth of the canyon, where, just below the source of the fire, lay a series of deep pools and riffles that only a handful of fishermen ever get to in a year's time.

I don't like backtracking before I'm through for the day, so I decided to head out across the prairie. It had been years since I'd been all the way up to the canyon, and I was excited about seeing it again.

I decided to bag the fishing, at least for a while, and charge all the way up through the canyon until I could actually see the flames. Then I could wade back downstream with the current and fish all the way home. If I timed it just right, I'd be meeting Colin at the Vanagon right at dark.

The horse trail above the creek bed rises to about a hundred feet above the water in a few spots, so I thought I ought to make my way down to the water while I still had a chance. I jumped off the trail and hop-stepped down a 60 degree slope of loose shale scree, sliding two or three yards with each step amidst a tinkling waterfall of rock chips until I reached the bottom. Then I started wading, running and boulder hopping up through the canyon until I reached a sulfurous hot springs just below the mouth of a small feeder stream-where I first smelled the smoke-and where my desire to actually see the fire rapidly began to fade.

There is a certain lonely, spooky, spiritual adrenaline factor to spending hours alone in the high altitude wilderness that has always intrigued me, ever since my first summer in the mountains when, at the age of four, I collected spiders for a naturalist at the Rocky Mountain Biological Labs at Gothic Mountain Colorado.

But things were starting to get out of hand. The smoke was so close now I had to look almost straight up to see it, and every time the wind shifted in my direction I thought I could actually hear the snapping and the crackling of the flames. I was still a mile or two from the actual fire, but my imagination was starting to run wild. My mind kept conjuring a herd of snarling grizzly bears running headlong down the mountain in a panic retreat from a crowning wall of fire. I decided it was time to start thinking about fishing again.

I heard the droning engines of a large plane laboring toward me from the north, and then saw it appear momentarily in a wafting, ephemeral seam of clear sky in the middle of the burgeoning smoke and drifting ashes.

It was an old World War II tanker of some kind with two propeller engines on each wing and a belly full of water and fire retardant, I guessed. So hallelujah, there was hope for Park Service after all.

I tried to follow the sound of the engines through the smoke as I re-strung my rod and greased up another grasshopper fly. But it was hard to figure out what was going on. The plane circled overhead twice, making two complete circumferences around the fire area, and then it left again, lumbering off toward the clear skies of Mt. Washburn and points west, without ever losing altitude, and without swooping down to empty its watery load.

The fishing was indescribable. I slaughtered them like never before. My grasshopper flies became so saturated with fish slime they wouldn't float anymore, so I switched over to Wulff flies and then to Humpies, eventually exhausting my meager collection of dry flies. I wasn't in a mood to fish wet flies, so I tied on my last floater, a gargantuan foam bodied Salmon Fly imitation that was more bass popper than trout fly.

To my great surprise, the Salmon Fly turned out to be the fly of the day. Instead of a strike every five or six casts, I was suddenly nailing a fish every second or third drift! And I didn't have to worry about my slimy tin of Muclin, because there was enough foam on that fly to float a small trout.

After twenty five years of fly fishing in Montana, this had to be the best day yet. In some of the very best spots, say where a choppy, medium current lapped up against a rock cliff wall, I would often watch two or three shadows rise up at once in a finny foot race to see who got to the Salmon Fly first.

The water in the main creek was so sulfurous from the hot springs it was nearly undrinkable, and I was getting mighty thirsty. So I began boulder hopping and swimming down through the canyon, trotting along the gravely beaches, body surfing through the narrow canyon riffles and fishing here and there until I reached the mouth of Ruby Creek, where I drank about a gallon of sweet mountain water, stretched out backwards on a patch of soft wet moss and savored the events of the day.

I must have dozed off for a few minutes, because I woke up to the throbbing chop chop chop of another helicopter. I decided to pack up my rod and head back to the car. If I didn't waste any time, I would still get there before dark.

After about an hour's forced march down along the dry sagebrush bench above the river, I finally dropped back down into the creek bottom about a half mile above the highway and surprised a spin fisherman who was working some deep water along the edges of a beaver lodge. I stopped to chat with him for a while, to see how the fishing was, and to see what he thought about the fire.

He didn't seem too concerned.

""I'm from Jackson,"" he said. ""I've got a summer place down there.""

Then he said, ""You know, I've been fishing the lake for years, (was he talking about Jackson Lake, or Yellowstone Lake? I wasn't sure) and I've caught a zillion cutthroats, but I've never seen as many big ones as they've got right here in this creek.""

""What're you fishing with,"" I asked?

He pulled up the tip of an old, weather worn spinning road and dangled a small lead headed jig in front of me. It seemed to have a wide band of silver tinsel stretched out along the shank of the hook, embedded in an oblong, minnow shaped lump of clear soft plastic.

""I use 'em all the time,"" he said. ""Best damned lure ever made. But ya know, there don't seem to be any small ones here. They're all fourteen inches or bigger, and I've taken a few that were pushing twenty inches.""

""Well, don't tell anyone,"" I said. ""If they don't all boil to death, they'll still be here next year.""

""Oh, I suppose,"" he said. ""Course we had a fire like this down in Jackson a few years back, when they first started this let-it-burn thing, and it never did amount to much but a bunch of smoke. Had everyone down in Jackson mad as a hornet's nest though.""

""Yeah, I remember that fire,"" I said. ""But that was burning in a lot of damp, north facing spruce timber. And it's a hell of a lot drier than that up here.""

""Yeah, it's drier'na pop corn fart alright,"" he said. ""I suppose you're fishing with flies. D'you manage to catch anything yet?""

""Oh I do alright,"" I said. ""See you later. I'm heading back in.""

It was interesting, I thought, that he'd noticed there weren't any small fish in here. Colin and I had wondered about it for years. We had also noticed that the fish all seemed to leave in the fall. We'd more or less decided that the shallow waters in this meadow section scoured out with anchor ice each winter, that these were migratory fish, that they came here during the summers, and then swam back downstream to the deep pools in the Yellowstone for the winter.

But it occurred to me, just then, and for the first time, that I'd been catching quite a few tiddlers in the upper canyon.

""Those loose pea gravel runs between the canyon pools must be where they spawn,"" I thought. ""And I'll bet that's where the big meadow fish go to spend the winter.""

""I'll have to come back this fall,"" I promised myself.

And then, as I looked back over my shoulder, ""If there's anything left of it,"" I thought.

Colin was snoring in the back of the Vanagon when I got there. He woke up with a start when I threw open the sliding door.

""What a day,"" I said.

""I could die tomorrow and I wouldn't have any complaints,"" said Colin. ""What'a'ya say we drive up to Silver Gate and have a snort?""

We drove on up to Silver Gate to get a beer at the Range Riders, and then on to Cooke City to get a steak at the Watuck. We thought about getting a motel and staying the night, but there was a lot of smoke in Cooke and Colin's asthma was acting up. My feet were so sore I wasn't sure I'd be able to fish the next day anyway, so we filled a pair of foam cups with weak, lukewarm western coffee and headed back towards Bozeman.

When we got to the Northeast Entrance to the Park a ranger was still sitting in the dimly lit ticket booth, which was unusual for that time of night. He must have been waiting for someone. He tried to wave us on through, but I wanted to chat with him, so I rolled down my window and asked him about the fire.

""Which one?"" he said. ""We've got several of them burning right now.""

""The one up above Stash Creek,"" I said.

""Oh you mean the Clover Mist fire,"" he said. ""It's burning about three or four hundred acres right now, up on the Looking Glass plateau.""

""Well, what happened with that tanker plane?"" I asked. ""It flew in about two o'clock this afternoon, circled the fire twice and then left.""

""There was a back country research cabin that was threatened, so we sent the plane up there to try and save it, but by the time they got there the cabin was already gone. It's our policy not to fight lightning caused fires unless structures are endangered, and the cabin was already lost. So they flew on over to the North Fork fire and dumped their load there. The North Fork fire was man caused, so we're doing everything we can to stop it.""

""Well, I'll tell you,"" I said. ""If you don't stop this one soon it'll be here in Cooke City by the end of the month.""

""Oh we're not too concerned about the Clover fire,"" he said. ""There's a lot of timber between here and there.""

""That's what I'm talking about,"" I said.

On the way home that night we talked a little about the fires, but mostly about the fishing. Colin was surprised to hear my tale of the invincible Salmon Fly. Small hopper patterns had been our mainstay here for years. There are zillions of small hoppers in the Park's northern valleys each summer, and the drier it is the more hoppers there seem to be. They fly away from your footsteps like macro dust particles as you plod your way through the tall brown grasses.

But there are always a few of the giant hoppers there too, the big yellow bellied locusts that can jump twelve feet and then fly for another thirty or forty yards. And it must have been these big, buzzing, clattering locusts that the cutthroats were taking my orange-bellied Salmon Fly for.

I told Colin about my new theory of the migratory meadow fish, about how I now thought it was upstream rather than downstream that they went to for the winter.

""It doesn't sound right to me,"" said Colin. ""I can't see them swimming back upstream when the water gets as low as it does.""

""I'm too old to hike up to that canyon in any case, so it will have to be your adventure.""

Then he added, ""Either way we should come back again soon. I'm afraid there won't be enough water to fish in if we wait too long.""

But it wasn't to be. Because by the first of August Yellowstone Park officials were starting to show the first signs of genuine alarm as the summer blazes, whipped by weeks of hot, dry gusty wind storms, were starting to exhibit what fire fighters refer to as ""extreme behavior.""

The lodgepole pines were reacting to the severe drought conditions by closing down their ""stomata,"" the minute pores in the surface of the pine needle that normally, and collectively, release vast quantities of excess water vapor into the forest atmosphere. Forest humidity readings were reaching unprecedented lows of five percent and less, with no hint of rain in sight.

Later that month, on ""Black Saturday,"" the twentieth of August, 1988, one hundred and fifty thousand acres of timber burned in a single day.

By the end of the first week in September the whole park seemed to be on fire. Alarm was rapidly turning into total panic as fierce mushrooming convection currents of superheated smoke and steam a half mile wide and forty thousand feet tall could be seen from a hundred miles away. Cooke City had been evacuated and Old Faithful was on the verge of being lost. Tidal waves of fire and gale-force winds were blowing down mature stands of old growth lodgepole pine like stacks of paper cards, crowning over the tree tops and exploding across the high ridges. Twenty-four-a-day retardant flights, nine-thousand firefighters and many hundreds of army six by sixes, all terrain vehicles and pumper trucks from as far away as Minnesota and South Dakota were like a family of beavers trying to hold back the flood waters of the Nile.

On the evening of the tenth of September, all non-essential employees, rangers and their families prepared to evacuate the Park headquarters at Mammoth Junction as a ring of crowning, superheated incendiary mountain tops to the west, to the south and to the east, like a belching archipelago of spuming pre-cambrian volcanoes, routed the darkness of the night skies and closed to within a few frightening miles of town.

On the morning of the eleventh of September, a light moist snow fell on the Park, and the climax of this season of despair was over. A few of the fires, including the massive 450,000 acre Clover Mist fire, now some thirty to forty miles east of Cooke City, flared and smoldered on into the end of October. But none of them ever really got going again.

When the smoke had finally cleared, Park reconnaissance flights revealed that although the outer perimeters of the fires did encompass an enormous area, as much as fifty percent of the timber within those perimeters still remained intact.

Raging rivers of fire near the Norris Geyser Basin and along the highway between Mammoth Junction and Tower Falls had vaporized huge blocks of timber, leaving little more than blackened toothpicks puncturing a soft fluffy groundscape of powdery white ash. But larger areas were scorched by milder blazes, leaving a curious mosaic of burned, slightly burned and untouched timber.

Most of the meadow areas in the Northern end of the Park were burned off in late August and early September, but grassy meadows don't burn with much intensity, and they will be back as green-and possibly overgrazed-as ever next summer.

The Park Service will have to wrestle with political decisions about its management policies for years to come. In recent congressional hearings Park officials did admit they could indeed have extinguished the Clover Mist fire-if they had acted aggressively in its earliest stages-but still kept in question the wisdom of doing so. Most of the rest of the fires were uncontrollable from their inception, making the question of Park policy somewhat moot.

In defense of their Let-It-Burn policy, which had, of course, been abandoned long before summer's end, Park officials argued that the severity of the fires had been exacerbated by a hundred years of ill-advised fire suppression, which had built up an unnatural and dangerously combustible inventory of dry old growth timber in the Yellowstone Ecosystem.

Others argued that a better policy would have been to suppress all fires during dangerous, unpredictable drought conditions, and then, in wetter years, to burn off unwanted stands of old growth timber with carefully planned ""prescribed burns.""

At the heart of this issue is an unresolved philosophical conflict between those who want an active ""hands on"" management policy for the Park, and those who prefer to let nature run its course, with as little artificial manipulation by man as possible.

On a late October trip through the Park with some friends last fall, we stopped briefly at the turnout across from the President's pool. We contemplated hiking across the still smoldering meadow to the cindery remains of the canyon, to see if the elusive, mysterious migratory cutthroats were indeed there as I suspected. But we decided to wait for at least another season to find out.

Yellowstone needs to lick its wounds for awhile.

Later that evening as we watched a beaming sunset filtering through the mountain peaks near Mammoth Junction, reflecting brightly off the smooth rimrock canyons to the south, silhouetting blackened lodgepoles on the high ridges to the west like rows of lonely, strangely naked soldiers, it wasn't clear that the fiery storms of the summer could have or should have happened any other way.

The bureaucratic and political squabbles of mankind had, however temporarily, been transcended by the powers of nature.

\- Tattooed (planning to get a lot more this year)

\- Into games (currently playing Ghost of Tsushima and Life is Strange)

\- Into movies (I have a letterboxd account)

\- Homebody but I don't mind going out every once in a while

\- Milktea, chai latte > coffee (sorry, I can't have coffee drinks, haha)

1qour0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qour0s/was_this_a_prank/,Was this a prank??,"I (30F) finally started dating (late bloomer) after going on maybe one date a year for the longest time. So far I’ve been on 7 dates with 5 different guys. I need confirmation if whatever I just experienced was real or a prank.

I met a guy (30M) on Bumble who is a traveling photographer who just moved to my city. Good conversation on the app and we agreed to get coffee this past Saturday. The date was fun — a two‑hour coffee date with no lull in conversation. I left, and he later asked for my number and said he’d love to see me again when he gets back from his trip.

Texting was good too — back and forth banter, jokes, good energy.

Monday, after some banter throughout the day, he asked if I was free that night to meet up. I wanted to get to know him more and find out what he’s looking for, so I said yes and we went to a local Vietnamese spot.

I need help trying to figure out if this was a bit or what was going on.

Here is what happened over dinner:

* When asked what inspires his photography or what he looks for when he goes out shooting, he didn’t have an answer besides “Americana.”
* He couldn’t think of any hobbies outside of photography and then said “driving at night” and “my bed.”
* Says he doesn’t watch movies or TV because it takes too much focus, and the only two films he saw this past year were *Rush Hour* and *Rush Hour 2*.
* Favorite genre of music is hip hop but not “the good stuff” — he prefers SoundCloud rappers even though “the lyrics are terrible.”
* He doesn’t like to read or listen to audiobooks because it’s too hard to follow without taking notes.
* Told me his favorite comedian is someone who jokes about either doing ads or selling used sex toys… and that that is his kind of humor.

He at least paid for dinner, but I left wondering if this was a prank...

The next day he texts, “I’m sure you’d agree we don’t have any romantic connection at all.” I wasn’t planning on seeing him again, but the whole thing left me confused.

Electrician (from the developer, new construction) recommended I replace the GFCI. After replacing it it seemed to work okay for about 2 to 3 days and then the circuit breaker started tripping again. 

I then moved the toaster oven to another part of the kitchen on a separate circuit. The toaster oven seemed to work fine for about 3 weeks and then started tripping that circuit breaker. The only other item on that circuit is a plug-in night light. 

Can two circuit breakers be faulty?

I've had some intense gastritis symptoms which started about 2 weeks ago, went to doctors who suspect gastritis or intense acid reflux and they prescribed omeprazole and bland diet for a few weeks. However, I'm seeing a lot online about how long this could actually last.

im posting because, and im not sure if this is whiny, but my mental health is actually suffering. the lifestyle change and prospect of it staying this way for months is really disheartening, and I definitely love to eat so im having trouble adjusting. I've cried every night, just super upset that this has happened to me. I suppose the bland diet and medicine is helping, but even a few strawberries this morning set off uncomfortable pain - it's just really frustrating!

I know that I have to suck it up, have to refrain from virtually all foods, but I was hoping anyone in this community could help with the following questions, in a hopeful way!

when, from your symptoms and treatment starting, did you start being able to have coffee every now and then?

what helped you in healing or getting into a normal ish rhythm? even despite spicy/acidic food?

did any foods surprise you, that you could eat? so far, croissants have actually been okay for me

I'm aware I could have a long road ahead of me, but just need a bit of hope that my life could go back to even remotely normal, I literally just got a new coffee machine so really sucks!!",1,1769557308.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

1qoun72,https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1qoun72/a_decade_of_mystery_symptoms_and_a_suprising/,A Decade of Mystery Symptoms - and a Suprising Resolution,"After ten years of chronic illness, I am relieved to finally be able to write the post I had hoped I could one day write....

It’s long. But I think you'll find it interesting. If you have also spent years chasing a mystery illness, you will understand.

Finding out the source of these chronic health issues has taken up a significant amount of my free time for nearly a decade. And it has become almost an obsession for the last two years. If you want to skip to the answer, I'll entirely understand. I'll reverse things and put a TL;DR at the end. But I won't spoil the surprise by putting it here at the top. I think the answer is both pretty unique and potentially very common. And it's nothing to do with acceptance or resistance either. 

Over the last ten years I have spent cumulatively weeks, if not months, of my life here on reddit (and other sources) trying to work out what was going on. And I have done DEEP research on all sorts of sub reddits. And while none of these turned out to be the **sole** cause - I am incredibly grateful for all the information shared. Along the way I have discovered various things about my body, my genetics and my diet which WILL continue to be useful to me.

For that reason, I admit that I'll be posting this in the MCAS and histamine intolerance sub reddits, EDS sub reddit, CFS sub reddits, LPR sub reddits, muscle tension dysphonia sub reddits, the MTHFR subreddits, and maybe more. But for good reason - I believe that this is a multi system issue and I can explain the links further in the comments if desired.

Its relevance to EDS is far from concrete. I have never been diagnosed with EDS though I do show many of the characteristics. However I believe it pulls together aspects of EDS which (to my understanding) is correlated with MTHFR polymorphisms, which are linked to histamine breakdown pathways via SAMe and HMNT, which link straight into MCAS and Histamine Intolerance.

I hope that at some point, this helps someone else. Its hard to know how unique my case is, but the answer turned out to be crushingly simple, and yet eluded me for decades. Join me for a brief overview and a writeup of my journey...

**THE ONSET**

It's worth noting from the off that by most measures I'm a fit and healthy man. I run, cycle, used to work out 3-4 times a week, don't eat too many carbs. Eat a varied diet. I sleep well. Don't take drugs or smoke. Broadly speaking I've taken good care of myself, which made this all the more confusing.

I spent my 20s working in hospitality - from a barback to a barista, cocktail bartender to a waiter, and then into management. The dream/hope/plan had always been to open my own and by the time I was 30 I opened a restaurant in Central London with my business partner. We worked our asses off, but we were also lucky. It became exceptionally successful, and was for some time the most talked about restaurant in London. That was a deep relief to us and investors - but brought with it a huge amount of expectation. And I worked to banish my own self doubts. 80hr weeks and more for years on end. Often with no days off, or only occasional days off.

Early on, even before the restaurant opened, I noticed that I seemed to have developed **a slightly hoarse voice and a tightness in my throat. And often red, itchy eyes**. But to be honest I was so busy I didn't pay much attention. Symptoms were come and go. My body would ache - but I was doing 14-16 hour days on my feet often fuelled by not much more than coffee, adrenaline and staff food at 4pm. So that didn't seem too surprising. I certainly enjoyed a drink after work on occasion - sometimes quite a few drinks - but no more than most 30 year olds.

**THE LONG DECLINE**

As the years went by at the restaurant my symptoms worsened. **I developed pounding headaches, gut issues, fatigue, and itchy skin. Worst of all though, was the hoarse voice and throat tightness**. By the time staff briefing came round at 5pm I often needed to ask one of the team to take over because I could barely get any words out. As you can imagine, running a searingly busy restaurant while not being able to speak is tricky. The entire job revolves around speaking to floor staff, guests and kitchen all day.

I began to notice that these symptoms always seemed to flare around the time I ate staff food - 4-5pm - and receded by about 9pm. So I came to the straightforward conclusion that I must be allergic to something I was eating. I began trying to work out what was causing it. Not knowing that this endeavour would be the start of nothing short of a medical mountain....

To list everything I tried would take far far too long. But suffice to say, I **tried all the usual main allergens (nuts, fish, crustaceans, gluten, dairy, egg etc) I tried cutting out carbs, I tried eating smaller meals, I tried cutting out coffee, I tried cutting out alcohol. But nothing seemed to help**. Frustratingly I would have a few good days in a week and then some bad days. I might then have a whole week feeling fine, one bad day, and then back to fine. Symptoms were intermittent and I couldn't find any correlation with anything I was eating.

**But I was getting worse**. From around 2017-2022 I began to become truly unwell. I developed dry skin on my hands, aching neck, chronic IBD type issues and an increase in all the previously noted headaches, fatigue, itchy skin, red eyes and hoarse voice. I was still working long hours and was getting worn down both mentally and physically trying to summon up the energy and enthusiasm to do what I loved - running the restaurant. I began to shift to a more office based role to conserve my energy and pull my weight in terms of work. But the brain fog and fatigue made work harder and harder. Depression crept in and though I could sleep like a log, I never felt rested. In many ways COVID and the lockdowns came as a blessed relief. An opportunity to rest and recuperate.

Over these years (2017-2022) I went to doctors, a consultant ENT, I had x-rays, blood tests, allergen tests, stool samples and more. I tried supplements, tried changing hair products, shampoos, tried meditation, fibre, antihistamines of ALL types, electrolytes in my water, broccoli sprouts, yoga, cutting out salicylates, a FODMAP diet, air filters, face masks, linen sheets and much much more. I wondered if I was depressed, had ADHD, maybe I was just getting old? Was it cooking fumes? VOCs in the walls? Maybe I was just exhausted. Maybe I was just imaging it and it was all psychosomatic? I became increasingly desperate for an answer but all medical tests and examinations suggested I was fine. I needed to supplement my vitamin D and my folate levels were a bit low, but not much else.

I was frustrated though, because **I was sure something was related to food**. My symptoms were always worse in the afternoon, and I tend not to eat breakfast. I also noticed that my symptoms were generally better on days off and could resolve for days at a time when I took a holiday. But they always got worse as soon as I started work.

**THINGS COME TO A HEAD**

By 2022 my wife and I were blessed to have a baby, and the combination of parenting, long hours, health and fatigue at the restaurant had crushed me both physically and mentally. I was no longer able to carry out my role in terms of running the business alongside my partners. And I feared I was not going to be able to support my wife physically or emotionally in looking after our family. 

I had come to believe I was just stressed and burned out. And I needed a break. **That would fix me right?** So by reluctant but mutual agreement I left the restaurant I had founded and dreamed of opening. I took several months off to look after my wife and daughter, and **my symptoms did indeed improve significantly**. I felt physically better than I had in a long time. Though psychologically I couldn't shake the feeling of failure. It seemed I just hadn't been strong enough to keep going. Perhaps I was mentally just not tough enough for the restaurant business.

From 2022 up until the present I have worked as both a consultant and for a technology company in the hospitality space. I went back to work after a few months. This time in a much less stressful role, more flexible, no staff rotas to contend with, and with very little financial or emotional stress. But **I was horrified to find out that my symptoms returned almost immediately after starting work again**. The headaches, hoarse voice, itchy eyes, throat tightness, extreme fatigue, dry skin and chronic gut issues came back even worse than before. 

In retrospect, this should have been a clue. But I was convinced my symptoms were 'real', related to my gut, metabolism, immune system - or something. Now though, working from home, I had the time, the control over my food (not eating staff food at the restaurant) and the desire to finally get to the bottom of things.

Again, to list everything I have researched and tried would make for a small novel, but in short....

**WHAT DIDNT WORK**

* I tried low histamine diets, low amine diets, low sodium diets, keto diets, high fibre diets, low fibre diets, FODMAP diets and more.
* I was SURE my issue was allergic/immune in nature at points and tried all sorts of MCAS and histamine intolerance ideas. Testing on the NHS never happened.
* I tried endless antihistamines, eye drops, nasal sprays, neti pots, raw local honey, bee pollen, herbal tinctures, nettle leaf tea, ginger, holy basil.
* I tested almost every supplements under the sun - VitD, all Bs, P5P, 5 HTP, taurine, glycine, creatine, choline, colostrum, spirulina, zinc, magnesium, lithium, bromelain, quercetin, black seed oil, copper, trace minerals, omega 3s, butyric acid, NAC, NAD, mushrooms of all sorts, high strength B1 protocol and SO many more. I have probably tried several thousand pounds worth of supplements.
* My symptoms seemed to flare in line line with my gut issues. I tried all sorts of probiotics, prebiotics, kefirs, l.reuteri, SIBO protocols, fibre, berberine, oregano oil, fasting.
* I suspected reflux of some sort. Silent reflux, bile reflux, classic reflux. I tried antacids, PPIs, limiting fat intake, bile salts, alkaline water and various other ideas.
* I investigated muscle tension dysphonia. I tried vocal exercises and massaging my larynx.
* I went to my doctor endlessly. I have been referred to ENTs, gastroenterology, endocrinology, had thyroid panels, full blood tests, cortisol tests, stool samples, CT scans, X rays, MRI scan. They even referred me to a specialist 'maybe this is a rare unknown cancer' centre in London who checked me for all sorts of things.
* I had my house checked for mould, I bought expensive air purifiers and ran them across my whole house day and night.
* I wondered whether I had any fillings or foreign objects I didn't know about causing inflammation.
* I tried vagus nerve stimulating devices and all sorts of nervous system relaxation, meditation etc.
* I considered **very strongly** that this was all in my mind. I had CBT therapy, EMDR and brainspotting therapy. I tried breathing techniques, getting 9 hours sleep a night. And I tried acceptance therapy too. Nothing made things better or worse.

**WHAT HELPED BUT WASN'T THE ANSWER**

At one point I ended up on the MTHFR forums and began to suspect I had methlyation issues. I took a genetic test and found I am indeed slow MTHFR, slow COMT and slow MAOA. Massive thanks to the advice and posts by [u/tawinn](https://www.reddit.com/user/tawinn/) on these communities.

* This explained why I had some huge success in 2022 with the carnivore diet. By eating steak and eggs and excluding flour/grains I had unwittingly supplemented creatine and choline and removed folic acid from my diet. This resolved many of my symptoms completely. In fact for a period of about a week I believed I had cracked it - I felt absolutely incredible. My depression lifted, I felt light as a feather. However, I was also not working at that point (I was home with the baby) and my physical (rather than mental/emotional) symptoms began to return shortly after.
* Carnivore / keto and avoiding grains remains an important part of my ongoing diet. I am not extremely strict - but I become prone to depression, reflux and sluggish feeling if I eat too many carbs or grains.
* I continue to supplement creatine, choline, glycine, folinic acid and Vitamin D with hyrdroxocobolamin (B12). And I take water with a pinch of celtic salt for electrolytes and minerals.

I also seem to gain general health benefits from a low histamine diet. I have quite a few genetic traits that slow histamine clearance breakdown pathways (slow MAOA, DAO, NAT2 and ALDH). I have always suffered from hayfever and my skin and sleep both improve on a low histamine diet.

**THE LAST FEW YEARS**

Over the last 18 months my desperation to work out the source of my issues ramped up to almost manic levels. Often taking up many evenings of research online each week. Symptoms were affecting all aspects of my life. Between 3pm and 9pm each day I could barely function. Regardless of my workload, stress levels and diet.

I methodically went back over all sorts of previously tested ideas. I went deep on Ehlers Danlos sub reddits, long covid sub reddit's, MCAS sub reddits and more. I tried complete fasting, dry fasting, elimination diets. Exercise, stretching, no exercise, 9 hours sleep, no caffeine. Anything and everything I could think of.

I also doubled down on the possibility that this was all in my head. Physical symptoms manifested by the mind. And/or a nervous system stuck in a fight or flight state - I committed to sleep, therapy, breathing techniques and more. I even tried micro doses of some special mushrooms. **But in my heart I still felt there was something more fundamental going on**. Something more tangible causing these symptoms. I didn't feel stressed or anxious - except in the sense that I wanted to feel better.

Over Christmas and New Year 2025/26 I had 16 days off work and **yet again all my symptoms resolved**. Despite eating and drinking anything and everything over the break, my dry skin healed, chronic gut issues resolved and I slept less but felt more rested. I was able to exercise again. Every day tasks - the washing up, tidying, sending emails - just felt so much easier. I felt like myself.

This time, as going back to work at the start of January approached, I felt calm, centred and positive. I convinced myself this time would be different. I would come to each day with a positive mindset, stretch and take breaks, be kinder to myself.... **but all the symptoms began to return that exact same afternoon. I was gutted.**

**AN ACCIDENTAL ANSWER...**

By this point, a few weeks ago as I type this, I was ready to tear my house or body apart to work out what was going on. My symptoms seemed to be directly related to work. I checked every inch of the study I work in, I read about people with allergies to computers, I moved the fan heater in the room and replaced it with an oil radiator. I read papers on the effects of screen colour, refresh rates, circadian rhythms and more. I tried more stretches. I adjusted my posture (which doesn't seem particularly bad). I wondered whether I was shallow breathing. But still I could not find ANYTHING that made a difference.

Which brings us up to last week. Last Monday evening, exactly a week ago, I lay on the sofa complaining about the issue to my Mum on the phone (bless her). I was lying on my front and using headphones so my hands were free. And **I began massaging my trapezius muscles just to the side of my neck**. I pressed one side hard while I chatted and then did the other, and was interested to see that my voice seemed to improve immediately. My headache seemed better too. My interest was piqued.

Shortly after, when I was off the phone I used the nearest hard object I could find (a wooden dustpan handle) to press against my traps some more and I think I asked my wife to massage them a little too. It felt good. I immediately booked a chiropractor for the next day. Just in case this could be the answer. I massaged them more Wednesday morning and had my first good day while at work in months. The chiropractor that evening seemed sceptical (as was I) but did note I had tight trapezius muscles and extremely tight jaw muscles. She did some standard techniques but I had already been feeling great all day.

**I am now 7 days in, and have had 7 days with a complete absence of symptoms.** The longest continuous stretch during work weeks for many many years. I have continued to massage my trapezius muscles and incorporated some stretches suggested by a physio. And frankly I feel like I have been given a new body. To my utter amazement my gut issues have resolved, my throat is no longer tight, I am sleeping less but feeling much more rested. The skin on my hands is improving and my eyes are no longer itchy. I ran one of my best 5k times in years and felt light and easy doing so. Best of all, the insidious brain fog and fatigue has evaporated - I think the dishes need doing and 10 mins later they're done. I think the study needs tidying and I find myself getting it sorted. Every aspect of day to day life feels easier - feels like it used to.

I have had so many false hopes and investigations, that **I wont fully commit to this being the answer until I can confirm I've had a month or so of feeling better**. But I know this time is different. To imagine that I might have spent a decade chasing chronic illness only to find that I needed to massage my shoulders seems utterly absurd. But that is the only conclusion I can come to.

If I had had a massage earlier, the last decade might have taken a different track. But for now I am simply rejoicing at having found an answer. I am overjoyed to just be with my family and feel well.

As to why this seems to have had such a remarkable impact - I'm really at a loss to explain. Some sort of effect on the vagus nerve seems possible. Has it allowed my nervous system to regulate? Has it increased bloodflow to some part of my brain? Feel free to hit me with ideas. 

**CONCLUDING THOUGHTS**

As I noted at the start, I have been chasing the source of these symptoms for ten years now and have done immense amounts of research into all sorts of aspects of biology - and yet this seemingly simple fix eluded me. I have read so many stories of people with chronic and often unknown health conditions and I know your pain. I have felt it deeply and been taken to the depths of despair not understanding what was wrong with me. I have been convinced at points that I was suffering from a systemic immune issue, gut issue or nervous system dysregulation. Hence why I have spent so long looking into MCAS, histamine intolerance, long covid\*,\* CFS, EDS, LPR, SIBO, MTHFR, MTD and more acronyms besides. My story is not intended to invalidate any of those conditions whatsoever. If that is your takeaway, I am at fault for not explaining more thoroughly. There is no doubt that all those conditions exist - and many are overlapping for their sufferers.

For years I have held out hope of a simple and reliable cure or source of my symptoms. I have read many other members' 'try this simple fix - it worked for me' stories. And they didn't help me. I tried them all. **This story probably won't help you either, and for that  I'm sorry. I know so well what it feels like to hope for an answer that feels like it will never come. But even if it helps just one person, years from now, it will have been worth writing it down** to pass this information on. And just maybe it will help more.

I wish each and every one of you good luck on your journey, and I hope the time comes when you get to write your healing story too.

***TL;DR here:***

*I spent ten years with a chronic unknown illness manifesting as hoarse voice, throat tightness, itchy eyes, dry skin, fatigue, brain fog and gut issues. Extensive medical testing, allergen testing, diets, meditation, supplements, breathwork, sleep, therapy (and more) did nothing. Last week I found out if I massage my neck and trapezius muscles, the symptoms resolve.*",3,1769557075.0,eds,3,0.8,False

I realized I was solving the wrong problem.,"I spent 3 months building Ward (a free phishing detection extension). I genuinely thought if I made something useful, people would install it.

Spoiler: they didn't (mostly - users in the single digits)

I did the whole thing: printed flyers for coffee shops, cold emailed librarians, even DMed random people on Reddit who posted about getting scammed.

Results:

1. Coffee shop owner took my poster down (thought I was the scam)
2. Librarians never responded, even after 2 follow-ups
3. Reddit DMs got ignored or ""looks cool but idk what you're tracking so I don't trust it""
4. I was banned from the r/Scams sub because the mod thought my extension was a scam LOL

**The real problem:** Nobody trusts Chrome extensions. And honestly? They shouldn't.

We've all seen the horror stories of extensions that steal passwords, inject ads, sell browsing history. To a normal user, my privacy-first anti scam extension looks exactly like malware.

I kept wishing I could just hand people proof - like a Carfax report but for extensions. Something that says ""someone actually looked at this and it's not trying to steal your data.""

That didn't exist. So I ended up building it.

**Extend Safely** \- basically the trust audit I wish I had for Ward

I've used the usual tools (CRXplorer, CRXexaminer, etc). They're fine for catching code issues, but they don't solve the actual problem: **users won't install your extension because they don't trust you.** They're getting savvy.

I see so many devs here grinding for months, launch, and get 8 users (shoutout to u/nhrtrix lol). The problem usually isn't the code; it's that we look sketchy and don't even know it.

If you're trying to get to your first 100 users or thinking about monetizing, the trust gap is probably killing you and you don't even realize it. 

* After we made some tweaks to the privacy section of our site & web store keywords our daily installs tripled. We even got people asking if they could pay for us on iOS.

Not trying to spam but legit think this could help people here in the same boat. You can use the tool today for **free**. If you like it, you pay a small amount for a full report + verified badge.

**The Story NSFW**

My bestie Mo (F, 30) and I (F, 29) have been each other’s rock for over a decade. We’ve been long distance besties for the last 5 years but met before that when we were both starting uni. We’re so close I’ve questioned if I’m in love with her from time to time. We’ve been together through the death of both our fathers, we’ve been together clinics together, worked on stuff together and got through college together. 

However, few months into knowing each other ten years ago, we hooked up on a drunk night in during a storm and classes were called off. 

I haven’t stopped thinking about it. For years. A decade now.

Ten years ago, we got drunk on cheap rum and we took our time exploring each other it was heavenly. The guys I was intimate with up until that time could never. 

She made the first move. She pulled me close by grabbing my ass and kissed my nose. It was so cute, then I grabbed her gently, picked her up and on to her study. I ate her out. I KNOW. Quite ballsy. I thought I was straight until something switched in me the moment she pulled me close. I became this incredibly ravenous eater and I wanted women all the fucking time after it. What the hell? I love but omg

I’m sure she tasted fucking divine too but what’s annoying is, I was too drunk to remember the finer details and I wish I was sober to remember it better. I want her to be burnt into my memory. I want to get her so close to the sun we both get burnt by the passion we showered each other with all over again.

Mo and I went on to have the most unforgettable intimacy and sex I’ve ever experienced. It fucking blew me away and that was when I knew for sure. Women 😍

But that was just a one time hook up. We frustratingly, went on to date toxic men to get away from the truth. We’re both extremely attracted to each other and possibly in love. I moved back to Canada after and have been with many women since. But I can’t stop thinking about *her.*

As a way for me to get it all out, I wrote smut. Oh god so much smut. I’m a writer by profession so this probably lets you know I get into my head a lot. And I’m not afraid to explore it. I dream of her. I really do. And I’m a Pisces so I kinda fucking romanticized the shit out of it.

**The Sad Reality**

I’m Canadian and I went to India for a bachelors at an ‘elite’ engineering school. I can’t say much more.

I’m on the west coast in Canada right now, away from it being illegal to marry and still frowned upon in public. I was raised in Canada and met her in uni when I went to India for a brief while. I’ve visited her almost every other year after. We never hooked up or anything. 

Agonizingly, we have to be careful when we meet up when I travel to her, it’s illegal in her country to be out in the open without harassment. 

Her family is incredibly strict, well known and very conservative. And will not give her permission to come see me all the way in Canada. Even now. 

But I can always go there and she can sneak away briefly. 

——————

**The Question** 

The past few weeks, we’ve been texting more than we usually do. We’ve been teasing each other about spending some quality time soon and she said she was ‘all mine’ if i made the trip work. We’ve had a lot of sexual tension over my visits there. 

We’ve never got down to anything, we are both in open to women only relationships with men who know of our bisexuality and relationship with each other. We are all very open and love and take care of each other. Our men have met and vibed really well, they are ok with us getting together every year and despite that we haven’t been out of line ever. But this year might be different.

We’ve agreed to meet up this summer at a small retreat in a coffee estate in the beautiful rolling hills in the south of india. It’s pretty romantic now when i look back at our chats lately. She says she wanted to be ‘all mine’, ‘somewhere dreamy, calm and far away’ and ‘private’. She made jokes about sitting on desks and wearing a skirt I’ve always complimented her on. Fucks sake.

We found a nice spot and even made plans to skinny dip together. Is this her wanting to try and relive that one night together from ten years ago but sober? The mild sexting leads me to believe it.

In essence:

Lots of sexual tension, known each other through thick and thin, hooked up once ten years ago and haven’t stopped thinking about it. Do I shoot my shot? Do I go through with this trip?

This is particularly concerning because it can cause severe respiratory issues to children, evident by the incident a few weeks ago where an infant nearly died due to accidental inhalation. 

Peaceful gatherings outside of schools should NEVER be dispersed with ANY form of chemical weapon, as un-developed bodies can contract short-term illness, long-term disabilities, or even be proven fatal, even after only a brief exposure. 

I do not have or know of any other footage but the school was identified as Whittier Wildflowers Preschool, which is merely a block away from the Glam Doll Donuts location where Alex Pretti was shot, and directly across the street and also attached to the church that offered coffee and a break from the cold for visitors of Pretti's memorial.

Authorities are getting careless. A rogue canister through an open window and into a room could be incredibly hazardous to small children. 

If ICE is careless enough to haphazardly toss gas canisters at a preschool, what \*do\* they care about?

This situation has been living in my head and I honestly need outside perspective.

I met this woman at my gym around August. We started talking casually, became friendly, and began hanging out. Late August, she told me she was going through a divorce and that she and her husband were separated. I didn’t believe her at first — it felt unreal, almost like a line someone would use to justify stepping out of a relationship. I remember thinking, *there’s no way this is real.*

Despite my doubts, we kept talking. We went on low-key dates (coffee, Panera, etc.). I never made a move until December, which I now realize was me wasting time and not being direct.

In October, she told me she had a crush on another guy from the gym. I didn’t think much of it at the time and assumed she was either joking or trying to make me jealous. Around this same period, I caught her lying about being in nursing school — she later admitted she was only taking prerequisite classes. That added to my distrust and made me question everything she said.

By November, I kept asking whether anything had happened with the gym guy. She repeatedly told me no. But her body language and behavior around him felt off — flustered, overly friendly, almost nervous. Still, she insisted nothing had happened.

In December, I finally tried to make a move. She rejected it, but what confused me most is that she *never* distanced herself afterward. She didn’t cut contact, didn’t block me, didn’t disappear — she kept me firmly in the friend zone while still staying in my life. That’s where things really started not adding up for me.

Fast forward: things faded out, then suddenly exploded.

I was shown **screenshots of messages** between the gym guy and another woman. The messages were chaotic, vulgar, competitive, and emotionally charged — basically two people arguing over the same man, accusing him of lying, seeing multiple women at once, and not being honest with either of them. There were also conversations about health concerns and trust issues, which honestly disturbed me.

What stood out was how real and unfiltered the messages were. This didn’t look like something fabricated for attention — it looked messy, emotional, and raw. The woman sending the screenshots claimed she believed she was exclusive with him, only to slowly realize she wasn’t. She also claimed she later found out *he had been seeing my gym friend during the same time.*

That’s when everything spiraled.

Around the same time, the woman I originally knew from the gym came back into my life, telling me that the gym guy’s “girlfriend” was harassing her and sending her messages. At that point, I genuinely didn’t know what to believe anymore. Between the lies about school, the vague divorce situation, and now this chaos, I assumed the separation story was fake and that her husband had no idea what was going on.

I made a decision I regret: I anonymously emailed her husband screenshots, believing I was exposing something he didn’t know.

His response completely blindsided me.

He replied calmly and directly, saying they *are* separated, that reality isn’t what I think it is, and that I should move on. He ended by saying that negative energy comes back around and wished me luck.

That email shook me.

Because if what he said is true — then she wasn’t lying. She *was* separated. She *did* tell me the truth from the very beginning, and I spent months assuming manipulation where there may not have been any.

Now I’m sitting with a lot of uncomfortable realizations:

* I didn’t trust her even when she was honest
* I stayed passive instead of either stepping up or walking away
* I got pulled into drama that wasn’t even mine
* And I may have crossed a serious boundary by involving her husband unnecessarily

I’m genuinely shocked and speechless that her story checked out in the end.

So my questions are:

* Was she telling the truth the entire time and I just projected doubt because the situation felt unreal?
* Or was this simply a chaotic situation where *everyone* (including me) handled things poorly?
* And how do you even process something like this without becoming bitter or paranoid going forward?

I’m not looking for validation — just clarity so I don’t repeat this kind of situation again.

Because if what he said is true — then she wasn’t lying. She *was* separated. She *did* tell me the truth from the very beginning, and I spent months assuming manipulation where there may not have been any.

Now I’m sitting with a lot of uncomfortable realizations:

* I didn’t trust her even when she was honest
* I stayed passive instead of either stepping up or walking away
* I got pulled into drama that wasn’t even mine
* And I may have crossed a serious boundary by involving her husband unnecessarily

I’m genuinely shocked and speechless that her story checked out in the end.

So my questions are:

* Was she telling the truth the entire time and I just projected doubt because the situation felt unreal?
* Or was this simply a chaotic situation where *everyone* (including me) handled things poorly?
* And how do you even process something like this without becoming bitter or paranoid going forward?

I’m not looking for validation — just clarity so I don’t repeat this kind of situation again.

After some soul-searching (and retiring from my brief career as “cool girl who accepts confusion”), I know this:

I’m not meant to do life alone.

I’m independent, financially stable, emotionally literate and I bloom best in love.

Not chaos. Not breadcrumbs.

The good kind: morning coffee, inside jokes, shared silence, gentle hands, and that unmistakable feeling of home.

I’m looking for companionship, affection, and a love that feels chosen daily, never questioned or hidden.

⸻

About me

London-based work in Product management. Three degrees, loved them all, barely use them…. go figure.

Well-travelled and hungry for more. Food matters. A lot.

Bleeding-heart, meat-loving liberal. Pro-LGBTQ, pro-Palestine, pro-Jews. Bernie-Sanders-ish. Anything Trumpian is a hard no.

Romantic, whimsical, deeply affectionate. Soft in love, strong when needed.

Books, poetry, art, music, dance, crafts, wonder.

Feminine, playful, emotionally aware. I laugh loudly and feel deeply.

I’ve done the work. I don’t date from emptiness.

I don’t want to be completed, I want to be met.

Fall in love with my flowers, and stay when autumn comes too.

⸻

About you

You’re settled in your career, financially steady, emotionally available.

You love travel, good food, adventure … and coming home just as much.

You’re consistent and clear.

No breadcrumbing. No disappearing. No guessing.

Masculine but gentle. Grounded. Warm.

Golden retriever energy with me. Gravitas in your voice (yes… very attractive).

You hold my hand in public, steal kisses freely, find reasons to touch.

You notice when I need care before I ask.

You protect quietly — traffic side of the pavement, guiding me gently, never rushing ahead.

In bed: attentive, confident, playful.

Soft when needed. In charge when it counts.

Presence over performance.

⸻

Non-negotiables

No mixed signals.

No emotional unavailability dressed up as charm.

Clear communication. Real consistency.

Boundaries respected. Always.

If it’s not an enthusiastic yes, it’s a no.

⸻

Looking ahead

I want love that grows - companionship, depth, and yes, a family one day with the right person.

No rush. Just intention.

Old-fashioned love. Modern emotional intelligence.

If you’re messaging

Tell me where you’re based. What consistency means to you. Your favourite small romantic gesture

pandemic. ex:i have to convince her and ask her gently without stressing her if she would like to even leave the house to get food.

I (26F) have been best friends with her (27F) since we were 17, but she has been largely unemployed, dependent on others, and emotionally stuck for most of that time. As a teen, she dropped out of high school, lived with her boyfriend doing drugs, and relied on her mom for money. After they broke up, she moved home, completed her diploma online, and worked briefly before being laid off during COVID.

She attempted college in 2019 but dropped out after one semester due to stress. In 2022, we moved in together, and I hoped this would motivate her to work or become more independent. Instead, she lived off government COVID benefits, and when those ran out, her mom paid her rent. During that year, she slept until noon or later, rarely left the house, and we never did anything together. I feel like after the pandemic, she got super comfortable at home and might deal w mild agoraphobia or severe anxiety and becomes overwhelmed by simple outings, like getting coffee. We both have adhd but I think bc I was about to graduate and then actively working, the same anxiety and weirdness we both once felt, I grew out of naturally.

After we moved out, she returned to her mom’s house. She decided to go back to college but needed to complete three missing high school prerequisite courses; three years later, she still hasn’t finished them. Even when i visit if we wake up at like 10, her mom jokes how we’re up so early? lol Now it’s been almost 7 years since anything has truly changed.

No matter what I love her to death, and I love hanging out with her when I do need a day to just do nothing w a friend, but I ofc still care about her and want her to not miss out on her twenties. She is my only friend, but she doesn’t ask about my life, and talking about mine seems to stress her because she feels stuck. When I bring up her situation out of concern, she accuses me of acting like her mother. I feel growing resentment and sadness that she isn’t progressing, while I’ve grown and moved forward since 2019.",2,1769555932.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1qou5ad,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qou5ad,"Capella Sydney Review (Amex FHR) — Two Nights, January","Dates: Jan 25–27

Nights: 2

Booking: Amex FHR (cash)

Room booked: Deluxe King

Room received: Premier King

Total cost: USD \~$1,470 all-in (≈ $133 taxes/fees)

Early check-in: \~1:30 pm

Late check-out: 4 pm (FHR)

**TL;DR**

Capella Sydney is one of the most comfortable city luxury hotels I’ve stayed at. Calm, design-forward, excellent food, and outstanding value via Amex FHR. After walking through the Park Hyatt Sydney, I’m very glad I switched. For my priorities, it’s not even close.

⸻

**Arrival & Check-In**

Arrived via Uber from SYD. Luggage taken immediately, no fuss. Check-in handled on the ground floor.

The hotel opened in 2023 and feels it: modern but warm, with a light-filled central dining space under skylights and a large art installation. The mood is calm and controlled, not buzzy.

Check-in was efficient and friendly. Upgrade to Premier King was proactively explained, along with FHR benefits in writing. Welcome amenity was a tin of local chocolates, which were excellent.

Only minor issue: concierge had some difficulty locking in a restaurant reservation due to the Australia Day holiday. Not a big deal, but they could be more anticipatory with guest requests during peak periods.

⸻

**Room (Premier King)**

Room size is \~50 sqm / \~538 sq ft, which feels generous for a city hotel.

Design is muted and elegant: brown leathers, wood, marble, dark brass cabinetry, and a lot of tasteful art. It reads modern but not cold.

The bed was extremely comfortable. Likely a California King. High-quality linens, pillows that were neither too firm nor too soft. Slept exceptionally well.

Windows have automated sheers and blackout curtains with bedside controls. Storage is via an armoire rather than a true closet. No way to fully hide luggage, but drawers were sufficient for a short stay.

Bathroom is a light box: large walk-in shower, soaking tub, and water closet with textured glass. Some reviews complain the tub orientation eats space. I noticed it, but it didn’t bother me. Privacy is limited, which was fine for me.

Shower pressure and temperature control were excellent. One issue: the walk-in shower leaked water and required a towel at the door.

Amenities are Bamford. I mostly used my own products, but the hand soap was very good.

Noise insulation was excellent. Very quiet room.

Views are not the draw. Mine faced nearby CBD buildings. Curtains stayed mostly closed. This is a hotel for rest and recharge, not harbor views.

I had originally booked the Park Hyatt Sydney. After seeing it in person, I’m glad I switched. The Park Hyatt has iconic views, but many rooms feel like fishbowls facing heavy public foot traffic. During Australia Day crowds, Capella felt like a refuge.

⸻

**Housekeeping & In-Room Service**

All guest services are handled via an in-room iPad. Slight learning curve, but once understood, it worked very well.

Housekeeping was immaculate and consistent. I’d leave early due to jet lag and return mid-morning to a spotless room.

Turndown included closing curtains, high-quality slippers, bottled water, and a small nightly amenity.

Room service was excellent. Quoted 60 minutes, arrived in \~15. Service style was polite, efficient, and non-lingering. Trays were picked up quickly after.

Overall guest services operation was meticulous.

⸻

**Food & Beverage**

Breakfast is included via FHR and is a standout.

You can order à la carte or use the buffet. Quality of ingredients is very high. This is not a massive, chaotic buffet, but everything you actually want is there: excellent fruit, cold cuts, yogurt, breads, and plenty of healthy and vegetarian options. Quiet, peaceful dining room. Service is attentive but unobtrusive. Coffee was excellent.

Where Capella really shines is FHR food credit value.

Over two days I had:

	•	Arrival-day sashimi platter and mixed greens with furikake

	•	Caesar salad via room service

	•	Steamed fish in tomato consommé with zucchini

Total out-of-pocket beyond the room rate was \~AUD $63.

At many US luxury hotels, a single lunch or dinner would burn the entire credit. Here, the quality and portioning made the credit stretch far. Food quality was consistently strong across all meals.

I did not use the signature fine-dining restaurant. The all-day dining room was more than sufficient.

⸻

**Amenities & Public Spaces**

Did not use the pool, but it’s heavily advertised and visually impressive, with an adjacent hot tub.

Gym is large for a city hotel and never felt crowded. Proper free weights, machines, and cardio.

Spa facilities are excellent: dry sauna, steam room, and high-quality showers. Great post-workout circuit.

There’s a common area with an afternoon happy-hour-style offering. I don’t drink, but they had a thoughtful non-alcoholic champagne-style option and very good canapés. Space is consistent with the rest of the hotel: art-forward, quiet, refined.

Guest mix skewed toward two groups:

	•	Affluent East Asian Gen Z / millennial travelers

	•	American boomer luxury travelers, many clearly tied to ultra-luxury cruises (lots of Silversea hats)

Dining room also attracted well-dressed locals on business lunches, which gave the hotel a lived-in feel.

Importantly, the hotel never felt hectic. It felt calm and restorative, even on hot days and during peak season.

⸻

**Location**

Located in the CBD. Street level can feel quiet or even dead, which I didn’t mind.

About a 10-minute walk to Circular Quay, the Opera House, and the Harbour Bridge. Easy Uber access. Bondi requires a drive regardless of where you stay.

Close to high-end shopping if that matters.

Compared to the Park Hyatt Sydney, Capella is much calmer. The Park Hyatt sits directly in heavy tourist traffic and felt worn on walkthrough. Capella feels fresh and noticeably better value.

⸻

**Verdict**

Capella Sydney is modern, understated, and exceptionally comfortable. Closest comp for me would be an urban St. Regis-tier hotel, but less stuffy and more restrained.

If your priorities are sleep quality, calm, excellent food, and value via FHR, this hotel is outstanding.

If you want balcony views of the Opera House and don’t mind crowds or paying a premium, the Park Hyatt makes sense. Otherwise, for me, Capella clearly dominates.

I’m going to get a green throw for the couches to save me the expense of new seating and then add a couple cheap beige jute rugs from Ikea (until I find a better rug I love) to warm up and break up the grey floor. I’ll also replace the curtains with a nicer geometric pattern and add some house plants. 

Non textile wise, I’ll remove the fireplace as it’s just sitting there (not attached to the wall) and replace it with a BESTA TV stand with warm, walnut doors. Then, I’ll get a similar walnut toned coffee table (first the Sonhult nesting tables, which will become side tables when I find a proper coffee table). I’ll pair this off with a nice small bookcase (probably a similar wood tone) to hold my record, books etc. 

I’m going to replace the GU10 bulbs with a warmer white tone, and get a cosy lamps (including a big floor lamp) for when I’m chilling out. I’ll also be adding a lot of art, both movie/music posters, prints of my favourite paintings, and photo prints (including some of my own). 

Longer term, I’ll repaint the walls a warmer shade of white and long long term replace the plastic planks and the grey flooring completely with something more natural. 

Is this a bad plan? Am I being stupid? Any criticism is welcome! Thanks for reading this far ",2,1769555745.0,interiordecorating,7,1.0,False

1qotzvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DysfunctionalFamily/comments/1qotzvx/my_grandpa_is_dying_of_cancer_and_kidney_failure/,My grandpa is dying of cancer and kidney failure.,"Hi Reddit. This is my first post and I'm not really good at gathering my thoughts but I'm going to do my best, because I think venting would do me some good. I'm sorry if this is long.

So, my grandpa is dying. He has terminal cancer and kidney failure. This is devastating to me (26F) and my immediate family, meaning my mother, grandmother, little brother (17M) and little sister (8F). My grandpa is like a father to me. I spent a tremendous amount of time with him when I was younger due to my mom being a single mother working two jobs most of the time and in need of help. We have an extremely deep bond. He's probably been the most positive and safe male influence I've been able to have in my life. I credit him and my mother to the honest, kind, and down to earth person I am today. I guess what I'm trying to get at is, we have a huge amount of respect and love for this man. He is truly our glue to the little bit of family we do have left.

  
On the other hand... my mom has a brother, R. Some background info: He's a cis MAGA male, married with two children, (19M) and (16?F). For reference R was in a bad car accident about 14ish years ago that left him unable to work. Not completely disabled but unable to stand and work for long periods of time. R was never much of a family man, and when he does come around for holidays or any familial gatherings you can tell that he would rather not be there and he makes sure everyone knows it. In turn his kids act the same way. To make a long story short, R has been eat up with guilt in light of my grandpa's terminal diagnosis. Showing up to the hospital for the first time in years and shedding tears. Every other time my grandpa has been in the hospital my whole life, while my family (my mom, grandma and siblings) was there offering our unwavering support, R would throw us the excuse ""I'm drunk and can't drive."" Every single time. Knowing his son and wife both have their license and are legal to drive.  

Now that things have gotten serious R has not left my grandpa's side in weeks. It is so unfortunate that this is what it has taken to get him to be around. It's even more sad that my grandpa has missed him so much his whole life, now in his weakest moments he is willing to put up with R's god-awful attitude just to have him around. During my grandpa's stays in the hospital R would become a topic of conversation quite often. How my grandpa wishes he could've known R's kids the way he knows me and my siblings and how sad it is that he  will never get that chance. This is one of the things I am struggling with. Now that R has been around the past couple weeks he has risen to golden star status and no one can do it better than he can. That goes for ANYTHING! From propping his feet up to fixing his coffee (yes I know he shouldn't be drinking coffee but you try telling that to this old stubborn hillbilly!). Now whenever you try to help him with anything he gets super frustrated and screams ""go get R!"". Also because of this I think R is suffering a bit of ""responsibility fatigue"" which in turn is giving him even more of an attitude than he already has. Not to mention R is not really much for responsibility anyways. They argue and fight all the time, the other day R was in his wife's face in the kitchen screaming at her causing her and her daughter to end up crying. Like why would you want to act that way around your dying father? Why would you want to add and cause more stress than necessary? It's disgusting. He's disgusting. He doesn't shower, brush his teeth, he is loud and obnoxious, and he just makes this situation 1000x worse. But we can't make him leave because my grandpa is lonely and he misses him. There is soooo much more to this story, but maybe starting here will make me feel better. 

Anyways, if you made it this far thank you for reading, I am always open for advice and questions, thank you. <3",1,1769555533.0,DysfunctionalFamily,0,0.99,False

ABOUT  
Pay what you will - all money I would make (cuz Bandcamp takes a cut) will be donated to a Minneapolis aid org. There is a lot of need right now.  
  
A lot could be said about this song, this moment...  
  
Minneapolis is currently a battleground in the US's cyclical war against white supremacy. I wrote this song in March 2025, when ICE was harming LA, Chicago, New York - non-combatants forced to defend themselves from fascist goon squads and protect their neighbors from being sent to concentration camps. Less than a year later, the war is on my doorstep, in our streets, our lives threatened, with only each other to rely on as the laws and systems continually fail us. It scares me. I am a writer, not a fighter - but there are many ways to fight a fight - and joining together gives us the courage to tap into creative ways to meet the needs of a community under siege. Even bards have a role.  
  
I hope this song brings you the courage, and know we will win because their violence cannot be sustained. We will carry each other through these dark times.

I've been single for a while, and even though I'm good on my own, I'd love to share life with the right person. I'm shy in person, so meeting people has been hard for me. I'm hoping for something genuine that can grow into something romantic and long term.

I appreciate people who are thoughtful, curious, and reflective. I'm drawn to someone who's emotionally present, honest, kind, and steady. I'm not into games. I just want something real with someone who treats people well. I'm a transgender woman, and I'm looking for someone who's fully comfortable with that. I'm also very comfortable with neurodivergence. If you're autistic, ADHD, or just a little different in how you're wired, we might understand each other better.

I try to eat healthy and stay fit, but I'm not obsessive about it. I'm a non-smoker and non-drinker, but coffee is absolutely my vice. I like dogs more than cats, although I don't have any pets myself, and I'm a night owl.

My style is simple and low-key. I'm into weekend drives, museums, bookstores, thrift shops, quiet walks, coffee dates, and farmers' markets. I'd enjoy meeting someone with a nerdy hobby or two, like ham radio, homelabbing, or maker-type projects.

I'd rather be home than go out. I love Criterion films and mellow jazz (Chet Baker, Coleman Hawkins, Bobby Hackett). I'm a big fan of cozy, candlelit evenings and that quiet lazy-afternoon feeling. I also enjoy learning new things and tinkering with tech. Peaceful days beat chaotic ones for me.

Rain turned the trail into mud beneath the full moon.

Every step dragged. Every breath burned.

Steel rang in the trees.

Two figures clashed in the shadows—one wrapped in worn, glowing armor, the other moving like the dark itself. Blades struck, sparks flashing before vanishing into the rain.

“You won’t take it,” the hunter said, his hand pressed tight against the Amulet at his chest.

She didn’t answer. She only circled him—patient, precise.

They rushed each other again.

The hunter swung first. Too slow.

She slipped past the blade, fingers grazing the chain at his neck. He jumped back just in time, heart hammering.

She isn’t trying to kill me, he realized.

She’s waiting.

Waiting for him to fall. Waiting for weakness.

They charged once more.

At the last second, the hunter let his sword drop into the mud.

Her eyes widened.

“No—”

He stepped forward.

Her blade pierced his chest.

Pain flared white-hot—but he didn’t scream.

“As long as I’m dead,” he said, voice steady despite the blood,

“you’ll never have the amulet.”

She tore the blade free and stumbled back.

The Amulet went cold.

Stone crept across his skin, racing faster than the rain could fall. His fingers locked in place. His armor dulled. Cracks whispered through his body as flesh became stone.

With the last of his strength, he pulled his arm over his chest—shielding the Amulet.

She struck the statue in rage. Stone shattered from the arm and fell into the mud.

It didn’t matter.

The Amulet was stone.

Her breath shook. “Then I’ll wait,” she said quietly.

“For the next one.”

She vanished into the trees.

The statue stood alone beneath the rain—

another hunter claimed by the cycle.

Stone cracked.

A sharp, piercing sound cut through the darkness.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

Ethan didn’t move.

Jack stood in the doorway, arms crossed, listening to the alarm scream for the third time. “You’re actually unbelievable.”

He walked in, grabbed Ethan’s pillow, and slammed it into his face.

Ethan shot upright. “What—Jack?!”

“You’re late,” Jack said. “Again.”

Ethan groaned and rolled out of bed. “Why didn’t you wake me earlier?”

“You told me not to,” Jack said. “Something about ‘training your mind.’”

“Never listen to me when I say that.”

They rushed downstairs. Ethan grabbed an apple from the counter, barely tying his shoes before they were out the door.

They hopped on their bikes and took off down the street.

“Trail or road?” Jack asked.

“Trail,” Ethan said. “It’s faster.”

“It rained last night.”

“You won’t get muddy if you don’t fall.”

Jack didn’t answer. He already knew how this would end.

The trail was narrow and slick. Ethan took the lead, apple in one hand, handlebars in the other.

He glanced back. “You keeping up?”

When he looked forward again, the statue was right there.

Ethan slammed the brakes.

The tires slid. The bike tipped.

He hit the ground hard, skidding through mud.

Jack stopped just in time, shaking his head. “Called it.”

Ethan pushed himself up. “Who puts a statue in the middle of a trail?”

Up close, it looked ancient. Cracked stone. Missing an arm. The surface was worn, like it had been forgotten for a long time.

“That thing looks ready to fall apart,” Jack said.

Ethan spotted something half-buried nearby. “I think this is the arm.”

“Ethan, we don’t have time—”

Ethan ignored him.

He pressed the arm into place.

It clicked.

For a split second, the statue’s right hand—resting over its chest—glowed faintly.

Neither of them noticed.

The light vanished.

The statue cracked.

Then shattered.

Stone collapsed inward, hitting the ground in a cloud of dust.

Ethan froze. “I just destroyed someone’s statue.”

Jack stared at the rubble. “It was already breaking. You just… helped.”

Sunlight flashed off something metallic beneath the stone.

Ethan knelt and dug it out.

It was heavy. Smooth. Circular.

“What is that?” Jack asked.

Ethan turned it in his hand. “Looks like a coin.”

Jack’s phone rang.

“Yeah—yeah, we’re late,” Jack said, hanging up. “My aunt’s already mad. Move.”

Ethan slipped the object into his pocket and grabbed his bike.

At school, Ethan changed out of his mud-covered clothes and sat on the locker room bench.

He pulled the coin out.

It pulsed.

Slow. Steady.

Like a heartbeat.

Ethan frowned and shoved it back into his bag.

In class, Mr. Wells stood at the front of the room.

“Summer break is two months away,” he said. “Before then, you’ll be completing a partner project. Worth thirty-five percent of your grade.”

Jack grinned. “Guess who your partner is.”

Ethan narrowed his eyes. “What did you do?”

Jack raised his hand. “Sir, could Ethan and Emma work together?”

Mr. Wells nodded. “That’s fine.”

Ethan leaned over. “Why would you do that?”

“Because you like her,” Jack said. “And because you’d never talk to her otherwise.”

“I had a plan.”

Jack snorted. “No, you didn’t.”

Later that evening, Ethan got home alone.

He tossed his bag on the couch and pulled the coin out again.

It pulsed once.

Then stopped.

“This thing is weird,” he muttered.

A knock came from the back door.

Ethan froze.

Another knock.

He stood, walked over, and opened the door slowly.

Nothing.

Just trees.

He heard breathing.

Then nothing again.

He shut the door and turned—

Something was inside the house.

Ethan stumbled backward and fell, scrambling across the floor.

The thing was tall. Wrong. Not human.

It spoke in a language Ethan didn’t understand.

His breathing went wild.

He grabbed the coin and pointed it at the creature without thinking.

The thing stopped.

Its voice changed.

“The relic,” it said.

Ethan’s vision blurred.

The room tilted.

Darkness swallowed him.

“This is a problem,” the creature said calmly. “I’ll try again tomorrow.”

Somewhere deep in a forest, a masked man stood over a pile of stone rubble.

“It’s gone,” he said.

A three-legged creature growled beside him. “What do we do now?”

“She failed,” the masked man said. “Kill her.”

“Is that what the boss wants?”

“She’s useless,” he replied. “Go.”

Chapter 2 

Ethan woke up staring at the ceiling.

For a moment, he didn’t move. His back hurt. The carpet was rough against his cheek.

“Ethan,” his mom said from the doorway. “Why are you on the floor?”

He pushed himself up slowly, heart already starting to race. The memory hit him all at once—the breathing, the shape in the dark, the word relic.

“I—I don’t know,” he said. “Must’ve rolled off the couch.”

She frowned but didn’t press it. “You scared me. I thought you passed out.”

“I’m fine,” Ethan said quickly. Too quickly.

She checked her phone. “I have to get to work. There’s food in the fridge. Don’t stay up all night again.”

“It’s the weekend,” Ethan blurted.

She paused. “Yeah. I know.” Then she forced a smile. “I’ll be back later.”

The door closed.

The house went quiet.

Ethan stood there for a second, listening. No breathing. No footsteps.

But the image of the thing from last night wouldn’t leave his head.

His eyes went to the coffee table.

The coin was gone.

His chest tightened. He searched the couch cushions, the floor, under the table. Finally, he found it half-hidden near the TV stand.

The moment he picked it up, it pulsed—slow, steady, like a heartbeat.

“This is what you were talking about,” he muttered. “This is the relic.”

His phone buzzed.

Jack.

“Yo,” Jack said. “You alive?”

“Yeah,” Ethan said. “Listen… can you come over? I need to tell you something.”

There was a pause. “You sound weird.”

“Just come over.”

Ten minutes later, Jack was in Ethan’s living room, arms crossed as Ethan paced.

“So,” Jack said, “you’re telling me you saw some… thing in your house?”

“I didn’t imagine it,” Ethan snapped. “It spoke. It said this—” He held up the coin. “—was a relic.”

Jack stared at it. “That’s a coin.”

“It glows,” Ethan said.

Right on cue, the coin pulsed faintly.

Jack’s smile faded. “Okay. That’s… new.”

A loud thump came from upstairs.

Both of them froze.

Another sound. Footsteps.

Jack grabbed the broom from beside the door. “If this is a prank—”

“I don’t mess around like this,” Ethan said, grabbing the TV remote because it was the closest thing to him.

The attic ladder creaked.

Jack swallowed. ""What was that?”

They climbed slowly, every step loud in the silence.

Boxes were overturned. Something moved.

A shape stumbled forward and hit the floor with a heavy thud.

Ethan and Jack both shouted and started throwing whatever they could grab.

“Stop!” the thing said.

Its voice was rough, but clear.

“I am not here to hurt you.”

Jack froze. “That’s not what things that don’t hurt people usually say.”

The creature slowly raised its hands. It was tall, its form wrong in ways Ethan couldn’t explain.

“I need answers,” Ethan said, his voice shaking. “Start talking.”

The creature hesitated. “I am Asura.”

Silence.

“My name is Kaelon.”

Jack glanced at Ethan. “That’s… not helping.”

Kaelon’s eyes moved between them. “Who among you carries the relic?”

Ethan looked down at the coin in his hand.

“This?” he said.

Kaelon’s gaze locked onto it.

“Yes,” he said quietly.

Then his expression shifted—confusion, disbelief.

“…How does a human have it?”

I don’t want to live in either state. Mostly cuz of the GA drivers. But here are some of the things I want in a state!

1. Needs to be a state where history jobs are a thing! That’s my current major and I want to find at least an entry level position in the history field. Could be as a historic guide, NPS, teaching, or even archives/museum work!

2. MOUNTAINS. I want to be in a mountain town where there is plenty of hiking and pretty places to do it! 

3. Somewhere that is in the budget for someone in their mid 20s. I need to be able to afford the dream

4. Somewhere with people my age. As a single girly and the fact I’d be moving somewhere brand new I want to be able to have community, specifically church community and within my activities. Learning new things, hiking friends. All of it. I’m an adventurer!

I won’t be moving for a couple years as I’m going to work and hike the AT before moving out. That way I can also begin paying student loans and get some of that knocked out. 

5.In connection to my last point I need to have things to do. I love to go out here and there and to have options for activities and groups to join. So if that means being within an hour or so of a city that works! Also local coffee shops. Must

6. Not quite as important but I’d like to have somewhere that does get sun in the summer. I like being warm and getting some color so I’m not super pasty haha

That about sums it up! I want to live where I live and stay for a long time. If it’s a lifetime so be it but things happen. I just need to establish myself and have the ability to start my career. ",0,1769555330.0,relocating,3,0.5,False

I was in a tight spot, so when they called me a month later for a new contract, I immediately accepted without thinking. Big mistake. The new job was warranty support for a major home appliance company.

It didn't take long in training for me to realize this job was going to suck. My old job was about genuinely helping people, which I loved. But in this warranty job, my entire mission was to find any loophole to deny customers' claims. In short, the caller was the enemy.

During my training, they sat me next to one of the call centre veterans, an older woman who had seen and lived through it all. She was a true professional, and I had a front-row seat to watch her masterpiece.

A man called, and she immediately pulled up his account history. She hit the mute button, looked at me, and told me this guy had been calling for years about his washing machine, which was long out of warranty. Somehow, through bullying, nagging, and yelling, he had managed to get free service visits and parts more than once. None of it should have been approved, but previous employees had given in just to get him off their backs.

She unmuted the line and let him rant. After he finished, she calmly told him four times in a row that there was nothing she could do for him. As expected, his voice started to get louder and more agitated. Finally, she let out a dramatic sigh and delivered a line that has been etched in my memory ever since.

'Sir, there comes a time in every man's life when he must stand on his own two feet. And take full responsibility for himself. And today, sir, is your day.' She said this in a tone that was a mix of a preacher and a football coach.

The line went silent for a second, then the man mumbled a quiet '...okay' and hung up.

All she did was type a few notes into the system, then she looked at me and said, 'He'll be back. He'll keep calling until he finds a new, weak employee who will give in,' and then she got up to take a coffee break.

I myself didn't last more than two months there. The job was absolutely soul-crushing. To this day, I still wish I had half of that woman's grit and could shut someone down with such perfection.",167,1769555287.0,InterviewsHell,5,0.98,False

Looks like the explosion came from the fridge or maybe beside it on the counter. 

Playing on hard++, if that matters. 

The fridge had a bunch of wine and an empty medium bowl in it; the freezer was empty; and the fire extinguisher slot was empty. 

Does the animal skull, cans of peaches, cookbook, coffee bag, farm pot, or fridge explode? ",3,1769555197.0,Voicesofthevoid,3,0.81,False

The job market is really tough right now, applying for internships is honestly kind of depressing. Lately besides studying at school, I’ve also been teaching myself how to build apps and other skills. I’m pretty interested in app development, so I wanted to ask for some feedback on an app I’m working on called Meowtion. It’s mainly a fitness app, but it also has weekly challenges with small prizes (gift cards) for the winners.

The main idea is to work out and earn some coffee money at the same time, like first place $20, second $5, and the rest $1. The prizes are small, but the goal is to motivate people to exercise more. I just launched the first challenge but not many people have joined yet, so I wanted to ask if you guys would be interested in this kind of feature?
