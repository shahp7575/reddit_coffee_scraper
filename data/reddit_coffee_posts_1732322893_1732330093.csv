It's my second birthday today! I was supposed to die 9 years ago on this date … but I didn't. And that is worth celebrating! 

I started my day off right with some fantastic morning sex with the beautiful stranger from last night, an out of towner here for the weekend. I'll see him and enjoy him again tonight. 

I guess he's not really a stranger anymore though. I met him originally a little over a month ago, he was here for some training for the weekend. We hit it off, fucked all weekend and decided to stay in touch just in case. 

I'm glad we stayed in touch because he came back for training this weekend and it's kinda great that it happened, I really needed something good. And he is good. I needed the universe to give me something special this weekend and it did not disappoint. 

He's got a good, big dick, nice arms, soft eyes and a gentle soul. He's a really good lay and we have excellent conversation. It's perfect that he doesn't live here and it's also perfect that he's here this weekend. 

Anyshit, I'm off to grab some coffee and to be a hedonist all day long. There will be life affirming acts all day, so basically lots and lots of orgasms! I think I'll rub one out right now before walking to the coffee shop. I'll try to only fantasize about the stranger but I know I'll end up thinking about someone else … not the man associated with today, but the man who left that I can't stop wanting. I always end up thinking about him when I'm fucking myself. 

I wonder how he's doing today. I *hope* he's doing great. I *hope* he feels loved today, and everyday. I miss him so very much, what I wouldn't do to be with him again …  

But I'm not and likely won't ever be with him again. Maybe someday I'll stop wanting him, just not today. But that's ok, I'm going to smile and celebrate my own existence today. 

Because today is the day that another man wanted me dead. But I chose to live and I continue to choose to love instead.  

Mabuhay!

My new patient doesn't even need treatment, she just needs someone to help her get out of here","Between 1984 and 1988, a particular metro area in the southeastern United States suffered a spat of violent murders.



The victims had no commonalities. Age, gender, color, appearance, occupation, socioeconomic status — nothing matched. Victims included middle school students and notorious cartel members, street cops and lawyers, charity directors and investment bankers, pharmaceutical executives and gas station clerks. 



The only reason authorities had any idea that the murders were related was because of the killer’s unique calling card:



A scattering of blood-drenched pigeon feathers.	



As months passed and the body count mounted, law enforcement came into possession of one single piece of eyewitness testimony:



Following the violent death of a firefighter, a middle-aged woman was spotted limping away from the scene, bleeding profusely from a gaping wound in her hip. According to the witness the woman was tiny, birdlike in her thinness, shuffling like someone elderly. Notably, a flock of pigeons followed her, bobbing along beside her like an urban adaptation of the pied piper.



This sighting was ultimately dismissed due to one impossible detail:



The woman was covered in grey feathers.



A second sighting was reported one year later, and was again dismissed. Similar sightings continued to crop up over the years, every one of them ignored.



In 1988 and entirely by chance, a bloody feather came into possession of AHH during the commission of a separate task. The feathers were then brought to NASCU. Peculiarities surrounding the appearance and physiology of the feathers were noted by specialized personnel, most notably T-Class Agent Wolf. 



At this time, the agency launched an investigation of its own. 



The investigation culminated in July 1988. During surveillance of the target — a very thin woman who was always trailed by a flock of pigeons, and who always wore a long, heavy trenchcoat, even in the humid summer heat — she managed to infiltrate a house that functioned as a front for human trafficking. 



What resulted was a bloodbath.

 

The target was badly wounded and therefore sufficiently weakened due to the energy expended during the attack. Agency personnel were able to take her into custody. Her capture was not without incident, as the flock of pigeons surrounding her began to attack. One pigeon, a particularly large male with one eye, refused to leave her side. As a result, the animal was brought into custody with her. He was later observed to pluck his feathers and place them on top of the woman’s astounding number of serious wounds.



Incredibly, the feathers facilitated rapid healing.



It must be noted that the woman came into Agency custody during a time when consideration and respect for our extraordinary inmates was at a low ebb. Due to her dress, her age, her general appearance, and of course her flock of pigeons, personnel dubbed the entity The Bag Lady.



The Bag Lady is a middle-aged woman of almost extraordinary thinness. Her hair is short and grey. Her eyes are large and a vivid, bright orange identical in hue to the eyes of the pigeon who came into custody with her.



Like her pigeon, she is covered in feathers. 



Unlike many inmates, the Bag Lady is articulate, intelligent, and possesses full speech and language capabilities. Nevertheless,  for the entire length of her incarceration, the Bag Lady has refused to speak with staff for any meaningful length of time. When asked why, her answer is always the same:



“Because I don’t talk to cops.”



This is admittedly understandable, given that the Bag Lady acted in an exclusively extrajudicial capacity, to extremely violent effect. 



Despite decades of consistent questioning and other, less savory methods to break her down, the Bag Lady has continued to refuse meaningful engagement with Agency personnel. In fact, the only meaningful contact the Bag Lady has had with personnel consists of attacks both attempted and achieved.



On four different occasions, however, she has been observed attempting to engage fellow inmates in conversation. 



Notably, the Bag Lady speaks extensively and frequently to her pigeon. The pigeon does not answer, but Agency personnel believe the bird is extraordinarily intelligent and that it communicates with her nonverbally. Due to potential similarities with the inmate called the Heart Bird, the pigeon is as closely monitored as the Bag Lady herself. Concerns over such similarities with the Heart Bird are the primary reason that the Bag Lady has never been evaluated for termination.



Fortunately, the inmate’s thirty-five year vow of silence was recently broken during an interview with T-Class agent Rachele B. The insights provided are fascinating. The content of the interview poses serious questions regarding the nature of death, free will, the possibility and potential purpose of afterlife, and the processes through which Khthonic entities come into being.



One might even dare to say it provides a few answers as well.

The first thing my son ever bought was birdseed.



He was four years old. His grandma put two dollars in his Christmas card that year, and he spent those dollars on pigeon food.



Michael loved pigeons. He started talking to them before he ever said a word to me. Watched them from windows when he was a baby and cooed at them the way they coo at each other. His first smile was at them, not at me. His first hello went to a baby pigeon blinking stupidly in a nest on our fire escape.



He loved them.



As he got older, that love grew stronger. By the time he was kindergarten, those birds would follow him everywhere, bobbing their little heads. They ate out of his hands, flew down to his arms, sometimes even landed on his head which made him laugh like nothing else. 





I’d been afraid of birds my whole life, so I didn’t understand. I asked him one time why he loved them so much. How he could make friends with them.



“It’s easy, Mom,” he said. “Pigeons think everyone’s their friend. They already love you. All you do is love them back.”



I still didn’t understand. Didn’t really want to, I guess. I grew up learning that pigeons were vermin. Dirty, ugly, unsanitary, brainless disease carriers. No, I didn’t understand at all.



But I did understand this:



Like pigeons, my son thought everyone was his friend. 



When describing Michael, you might use the word “gullible.” But that isn’t right. He wasn’t gullible. He was smart, he was intuitive, he understood everyone. He could look at the worst person alive and find the smallest, weakest spark of goodness flickering forlornly in the vast dark.



What he couldn’t understand — what I couldn’t make him understand no matter how hard I tried, how loud I yelled, how mean or desperate or cruel I got — was that a spark is not light.



A spark is just a spark. No more, and maybe less.



I could tell you about Michael’s friends. How some were born monsters. How some were made. How badly the ones that were made—the ones that weren’t born ruined— heart my hurt.



And how that spark of sympathy got my guard just enough to make sure I lost my son.



I saw him for the last time when he was seventeen.



We were fighting about his friends. Not the pigeons, I’d gotten used to them a long time ago. How they clustered around the fire escape every morning waiting for him to open the window, how they flocked down to the building entrance when it was time for him to leave for work, how his favorite bird, Mr. One-Eye, dive-bombed onto his shoulder every time they saw each other. 



No, we weren’t fighting about pigeons. We were fighting about his other friends.



It wasn’t even a bad fight. Not worse than any of our other fights, anyway. It went the same way it always did, he told me I didn’t understand like he always did, I told him he was being a little fool and his friends would be the end of him like I always did.



And he walked out the door to cool off, like he always did.



I thought he’d call a few hours later, apologizing and asking for an apology in return like he always did.



But he didn’t call.



I told myself he’d come home, like he always did.



But he didn’t come home.



And nobody cared.



My boy never coming back was the worst thing. The very, very worst thing that is, was, or will ever be.



But the fact that no one helped, that no one cared, that no one gave the tiniest spark of a damn, was almost as terrible.



I went to the police seventeen times. Seventeen. One for each year he’d been alive. Each time they told me Michael was practically an adult, we’d had a fight, and he was fully in his rights not to come home. One cop even had the gall to me it was about time he stopped coming home. Another one said I was lucky he was gone, because otherwise he’d probably come home one day and cut my throat for drug money.



The last cop took pity on me. She was a lady officer. Lady is the wrong word. She was a battle ax. Built like a brick shithouse, with hair like rusty steel wool and the scariest eyes I have ever seen. 



But when she looked at me after I taking my seventeenth report, there was nothing scary about her eyes. They were only tired. Sad. And lightless.



That look in her eyes was how I knew no one would ever find my son, and that was the scariest thing of all.



“Listen to me, hon,” she said. “This is going to sound like the worst thing in the world. That’s because it is. But it’s also the only true thing anyone in this department is going to tell you. We have almost no resources. The few resources that we do have? They go to priorities. A dopehead dropout won’t ever be a priority. But you can bet your ass some of the cops here will make it their priority to end a dopehead, especially one who’s a peewee gangbanger. No one is going to help you. No one cares about your son but you.”	



“You’re wrong,” I told her, even though I knew she wasn’t.



I didn’t give up. I’ll never give up on my boy. I went to other places for help. Citizen groups, social services, activists, community foundations, charities, all those places. At first it was wonderful. At first I thought I’d found my people, because unlike the cops they listened. They listened when I told them about my son, about how the first thing he ever bought was birdseed and how the first word he ever said was for a baby pigeon and how Mr. One-Eye rode on his shoulder and how he could look at the worst person alive and find the good. They listened to me and they gave me hugs and coffee and cookies and prayers and recommendations to grief groups and then they listened again.



But they didn’t *do* anything.



Finally, I’d had enough of people who didn’t do anything. 



When I said so to one of the group leaders — the one who was the best listener, the one who held my hands whenever I cried — said, “We’re your people. We’re here for you. We care about you.”



Grief and rage and frustration erupted. The most acute, potent frustration I’d ever felt, the kind that renders you mindless. “I need you to care about my son.”



“I understand. I hear you.”



“No. No. You’re wrong. I think you’re wrong. I think you haven’t heard a goddam word I said.”



“I have. I do. I’m always here for you. I’m listening. But…”



“*But what?”*

  


She looked at me, eyes tired and full of pity. “We only have as much as we have. We can only do what we can with what we have. What else do you want me to do?”



“Something,” I said. “Anything.”



But she didn’t.



No one did. No one but me.



And I kept on keeping on. Not because I wanted to, but because sometimes that’s all you get: The ability to put one foot in front of the other. Left, right. Left, right until you get somewhere else.



Only I couldn’t get anywhere else.



The pigeons couldn’t, either. They didn’t seem to understand that Michael was gone. As the days after his disappearance bled into weeks and the weeks hemorrhaged into months, the pigeons kept coming. Flocking to the fire escape outside our little window waiting for him to pop out with smiles and birdseed. His favorite pigeon, Mr. One-Eye, even took to following me whenever I left the building. He watched me as if to say, *Where is he? Where did he go? Tell him we’re waiting. Tell him we love him. Tell him we need him to come back*.



I couldn’t help but wonder how they were feeling. If they were just confused and maybe a little hurt in their little birdbrains, or if they understood. If they hurt as much as me, if they had holes in their hearts like me. Rotting, bottomless voids eating them from the inside out every second of every day. 



But I didn’t know how to ask, and they wouldn’t have been able to answer anyway.



And then Mr. One-Eye stopped showing up.



He stayed gone for one day, then two, then three and four and five and that’s when I knew he wasn’t coming back either. I hated that damned bird for leaving me. He was Michael’s favorite. Michael had pigeons the way I’d had dogs, and that particular pigeon was his heart. Mr. One-Eye was the closest thing my sweet boy had to a soul mate.



So if even that bird had given up on him, he was truly gone.



The sixth day after Mr. One-Eye’s absence was grey and wet somehow dead. Rain sheeted from the sky, but without any ferocity, without any power. It felt tired, hopeless, helpless to stop itself from falling. 



I was kicking my way home from work, tired and hopeless and helpless as the rain. I didn’t want to go to work. I didn’t want to come home from work, either. I didn’t want to walk. But I was still walking. Eyes down, one foot in front of the other. Left, right. Left, right. All rain could do was fall, grey rain on grey streets. All I could do was walk, grey girl on grey streets.



And then, out of the corner of my eye, so colorful it was almost obscene, I saw something.



Brightness against the rain-slick concrete, a small explosion of and white grey and sloppy wet red.



I almost ignored it. One foot in front of the other because that’s all you can do. Left, right. Left, right. Shoes slapping the sidewalk, dull and pointless, grey and empty.



But that explosion of white and red didn’t stay an explosion. It began to resolve. To take form. 



And the form it took was blood-caked feathers. 



The form it took was a crumpled grey chest shimmering all pink and green and white as it panted. A pigeon. A pigeon some asshole had kicked out of the way, or maybe even stepped on, and left to die. A pigeon who hadn’t run away from danger because it thought everyone was its friend, and what friend would ever be a danger?



I had never seen anything so pathetic. I almost left it.



But then I thought of Michael, and couldn’t bear to leave it there.



As I approached it, something bloomed in my chest. A feeling. I couldn’t figure out what that feeling was, only that it was suffocating.



I stopped and looked at the pigeon. It looked back with a single orange eye, fever-bright and fading even as I watched. 



It turned its head weakly.



And that’s when I saw it was missing an eye.



The sheer weight of grief forced me to my knees. But that weight couldn’t keep me from crawling across the grey, flooded sidewalk. It couldn’t keep me from scooping up that bright bloody explosion with desperate tenderness. It couldn’t keep me from cradling that Mr. One-Eye to my chest like I’d cradled my son a lifetime ago. 



I sat there in the rain until long after night fell, sobbing and holding the bird to my heart long after he stopped moving. People passing by took me for homeless. A few dropped coins into my lap. One lady even knelt down and tried to coax me to a shelter down the road, til I screamed in her face and spat.



No one stopped to help me after that. 



At some point, I stood up and staggered home. I brought Mr. One-Eye with me, holding him to my heart all the while.



I got drunk that night. Blind, stinking, hideously drunk. Not because I like drinking. I hate it. But I hated having to feel the hole in my heart more. This rotting void, a bottomless chasm eating me from the inside out every second of every day. It felt like I should be dead. Only I wasn’t. I felt like I was always dying but never got to be dead. 



Dead would have been better, but I couldn’t die. If I died then no one on earth would care what happened to my baby.



So I got drunk instead of dead. I didn’t really think it would work. I hoped that it would. I always hope. Hope is the only thing some of us ever get.



But being drunk didn’t work. 



Being drunk just made me angrier and crazier. Being drunk made the rotting pit inside me grow up and out until it was swallowing me whole. Until it was the only thing in the world. Until it was the only thing I knew, the only thing I had ever known, the only thing I would ever know. 



I thought I was by myself in that void, until I looked out the window and saw the pigeons on the fire escape. They alone were there in the pit with me. They alone understood. They alone cared what had happened to my son. 



So I opened the window by the fire escape and told them to come inside, sobbing every word. They swirled back in a panic, wings thundering. 



“No,” I wept. “No, don’t leave. Don’t leave. Come in. Come in here you goddamned morons, come in.”



I reached for them.



Everything tilted. The metal window sill bit into my belly, then scraped down my legs as the world flipped upside down.



The last thing I knew was the rush of wings, deafening but soft.



Beautifully, perfectly, profoundly soft.

	



For the first time that I could remember, I woke up in somebody’s arms.	



I opened my eyes.



A face looked down at me. An old man with round golden eyes and the gentlest smile I have ever seen, will probably ever see.



I craned my neck. Pigeons surrounded us, a shifting, bright-eyed flock so huge it spilled off the sidewalks into the street. Their eyes shone like embers in the dark.



I looked back at the man. His eyes shone too, and so did the skin of his face. He wasn’t human. He couldn’t be. For some reason, that didn’t frighten me at all.



“Who are you?” I crane my neck. “Are you an angel?”



“No. I am One Who Listens.”



It sounds ridiculous, but I could literally *hear* the big letters in that title. They came out of his mouth capitalized.



“Who listens to what?” 



“I listen to prayers. I listen to pain. I listen to rage. I listened to yours, you know.” He smiled again, teeth shimmering.



“Then why…” I blinked and shifted, groaning as electric pain bolted up my hip. “If you listened to me, why didn’t you ever answer?”



“Because We Who Listen can never answer loudly. Sometimes we cannot answer at all. Each answer, however soft and quiet, takes from us. Often it takes something we aren’t supposed to give. Always, it gives something we can never get back. See.” It held out its bare arms for my inspection. My stomach churned violently as the streetlight illuminated a relief map of pitted scars and wormlike welts and suppurating rotted pits like radiation burns. 



“What happened?” I gasped.



“I listened, and I answered.” He shook his silvery sleeves back down over his arms. “My answers took what I did not have to give.”



Frustration bubbled up, hot and poisonous. “If you can’t do anything, then…I mean, what’s the point?”



“There is no point, I think,” he said gently. “It simply is.” 



“Are you a guardian angel?” I repeated.



“We are not guardians,” it said, gently. “We are listeners.”



“Who is we?”



“Me”. He placed a hand on his chest. “You.” He pressed his other hand against my chest. “We.”



I looked at him, revolted as terror built in my gut. “Am I dead?”



“There is no death for us.”



“I’m sorry, but I do *not* understand.”



“We who were suffering, we who were alone, now go to others who are suffering and alone. We stay with them and we listen. We listen so they can feel comfort.”



I had so many questions, but couldn’t articulate a single one. “And you —you were you with me? You saw my…my pain, all that rage, heard all those questions?”



“Yes.”



“Well, I never felt you.”



“I know. Sometimes, that is the way it is. But still we try. Still, we do what we must do.”



“You said you answered. That’s why you’re hurt. You gave answers to someone. Who?” I sat up, grimacing as my arm twanged. “And why wasn’t it me?”



Before he could tell me, I looked down at my hands. Incredibly, I was still holding Mr. One-Eye. Even more incredibly, he was still alive. His poor sunken eye fixed me with a dulled orange gaze.



And something shot me in the heart.



The force of a freight train, burning just like a bullet, boring through me. Instead of smoke, it left a question in its wake:



*hurts stop it stop it hurting stop please*

  


Without thinking — only feeling— I cradled Mr. One-Eye to my chest and held him.



Pain erupted in my shoulder, overwhelming and familiar. The rotting void, endless and eternal, boring a tunnel to my very core, manifesting as a caving wound.



But this time, it didn’t spread.



It didn’t grow. It didn’t swallow me and the world surrounding. It did not become the only thing I had known, or the only thing I knew, or the only thing I would ever know. It stayed where it was, confined to its tunnel. It had no choice, because there was something more important in my hands. Something bright and living. Something alive and whole.



Mr. One-Eye shifted his wings, then stretched upward. I raised him so he could look at me. His beautiful, sparkling orange eye met mine.



Then he stretched out, beak catching the fabric of my coat, and stepped onto my shoulder.



For the first time since my son was born, I felt whole. 



He Who Listens wasn’t quite so thrilled.



“What have you done?” he wailed. Tears welled in his great yellow eyes as he stared at the ghastly wound in my arm. I stared, too. I couldn’t help it. It looked as rotten as it felt, a huge, ruptured wound tunneling through my arm. “It will never go away. It will never fade. It will only grow. You will have that wound and feel that pain growing until it finally consumes you.”



Before I could say a word, Mr. One-Eye flapped his wings. The feathers whacked my face, shockingly strong. 



Immediately, the pigeons around us responded.



They came in a bobbing grey wave, pooling around my feet where the began to preen. As I watched, the dropped their preened feathers — glistening, shimmering grey overlaid with every color of the rainbow — at my feet.



When the last pigeon had dropped the last feather, Mr. One-Eye tucked his head under his wing and pulled out a feather of his own. Then he crept his way down my arm —one foot in front of the other, left, right, left right —and placed his feather inside my wound. 



The feather lay atop it for a moment, shining. Then it melted into that rotting crater, leaving a delicate thread of whole, unblemished flesh stretched across the hole.



I reached down and grabbed the pile of feathers at my feet, stuffing it into the hole. It was like magic. It *was* magic. Each feather shone and melted into fresh flesh. Two handfuls later, there was no wound. After three, there wasn’t even a scar.



By the end, even the pain was gone.



I laughed.



It felt alien to laugh, rusty, even wrong. But it came out anyway, erupting out of me like a geyser. 



As I laughed, He Who Listens wept.



“No,” he moaned. “No, no, no. What are you doing? This is *wrong*.”  Tears fell from his great yellow eyes, shining like diamonds under the street lights. Suddenly, I felt guilty. 



“I’m sorry,” I lied. “I didn’t know. I won’t do it again.”



His face broke apart. “You are lying and you don’t even know it. If I show you what we do, you will ruin everything.”



That actually offended me. “Then don’t show me anything. It’s not like I asked.”



“I have no choice,” he sniffled. “I must do what I must do. You will do what you will do. Come.”



He toddled down the street. I hesitated for reasons I still don’t understand. Then I followed.



So did the pigeons.



He Who Listens spun around. “No! They cannot! *They cannot*!”



On my shoulder, Mr. One-Eye beat his wings again, whipping my face. The other pigeons obediently dispersed.



He Who Listens continued to argue with me about Mr. One-Eye, but I held my ground. People say you’re forever responsible for what you tame. I didn’t tame Mr. One-Eye, but I saved him. I think that makes me even more responsible, and I said so.



“Oh no,” he wept. “No. This is wrong. You will be wrong. What am I to do?”



“You are to show me what you’re supposed to show, or leave.”



“I cannot leave. I have no choice.”



“Then let’s get going.”



He wiped tears from his face and flicked them onto the concrete where they spattered like silvery rain.



And as we moved down the street, I saw people who hadn’t been there just a few minutes ago. But they all looked like they’d been there for hours. Languishing in the alleys, spread-eagle on the sidewalks, leaning against buildings as sobs shook their bony shoulders.



As we drew closer, one turned to look at us. Wide yellow eyes glimmered in its round face. A rotting wound glistened under its nose. The flesh of its lips had been eaten to the bone, exposing the teeth.



“Are these…do they listen? Are they all like you?”



“No,” he sobbed. “They’re like you. They did not listen. They answered. They gave too much. They gave what they couldn’t get back.”



We walked in silence after that. I avoided his yellow eyes glistening like coins in the night.



He Who Listens spent all night showing me what to do. Not once, not twice or three times, but twelve.



The first time was a homeless man huddled under a bench in the park. He was sobbing in his sleep, and his face —weathered but unmistakably young — made my heart ache. 



“Sit,” said He Who Listens.



“What if he wakes up?”



“He will not. Sit, and touch him.”



When I laid my hand on that boy, I felt his yammering heartbeat and saw his pain. I heard it. Worse, I felt it. I felt every terrible step in the tragic procession that led him here. Steps that were his fault, and steps that weren’t. It didn’t even matter what was his fault or what wasn’t. All that mattered was his pain.



Even though I could not take that pain from him, his heart slowed the longer I sat there. By the end, its rhythm was calm and steady. Maybe it was my imagination, but I thought his poor weathered face looked a little less sad, too.



“Yes,” He Who Listens said happily. “That is what we do. We listen, and we provide comfort by listening.”



Next we went to a lady sitting in a roach-infested studio apartment, hollow-eyed and expressionless as she stared at her blank television screen.



“Kneel,” said He Who Listens.



“Won't she see me?”



“Not tonight. Kneel, and hold her hand.”



I did as I was told. 



Once again, I heard and saw and felt the most terrible things. Rotting things, things that get inside you and bore tunnels until they kill you. I don’t know how long I sat with her, but I know that by the end her eyes had closed and she was finally sleeping.



We saw a child next, alone and wide awake in a foster home, crying for her father. Then a young mother weeping in her kitchen. An old man in a nursing home, a teenage boy stomping his way down an empty street while tears coursed down his face, a young woman sobbing by herself in a dark office long after everyone around her had gone home. 



It might have been a single night. It might have been a week, or a month, or forever, or ten minutes.



Finally we went to a hospital where a man, balding and exhausted, sat at the bedside of a little girl with sunken eyes and dull, dying skin. I knew she was fading. I knew she would be dead by morning, because when I touched her I felt only the faintest veil of emotion, all of it warm and soft.



So I turned to the father. I didn’t sit this time. I leaned over him the way I used to lean over my son whenever he cried, and wrapped my arms around him.



His pain hit me with the force of a tsunami, repulsive and powerful.



*Help help help help help I can’t lose her she deserves more she’s all I have help her help her help*

  


The sheer force punched through my heart, wide as a freight train, hot as a bullet, painful as death by acid bath. 



The man cried out. I thought I’d hurt him. I recoiled as he lurched forward, reaching for the child on the bed.



Her eyes were open, and color was returning to her face.



“*What have you done?*” screamed He Who Listens.



I staggered back, gasping as the wound in my chest pulsed and blood dripped down my chest, soaking my dirty shirt. “*You’ve given what you cannot give back! It will consume you!”*



I barely listened. Single-minded purpose filled me and I knew, in the depths of my missing punched-out heart, that I had to get outside, right now.



Somehow, I did. 



The pigeons were waiting for me. An entire flock on the sidewalk, eyes glittering knowingly.



Mr. One-Eye flapped his wings in command. They obeyed, dropping their plucked feathers at my feet. I packed them into my wound. New flesh grew, bright and shimmering as the feathers themselves.



It took longer this time, but that wound healed too.



“No,” wept He Who Listens. “No. You cannot do this. You cannot. You are an abomination.”



I had a vivid mental image of Who He Listens kneeling at my side, stroking my hair, my hands, holding my face as I wept and raged with no knowledge of his presence. 



Again I wondered:



What was the *point* of it?  



“No,” I told him. “The abomination is being able to help people, being able to *do* something, but choosing to do nothing.”



“You are not One Who Listens. You are only a monster.”



“No,” I said. “I’m One Who Listens and Does Something About It.”



He left me and didn’t come back. That was all right. I didn’t need him.



I only needed the pigeons. 



I listened everywhere, to everything and everyone and all their heartbroken, rage-filled, desperate questions. I didn’t answer all of them. I learned that some people don’t need answers. Many don’t even deserve. There are more of those than I ever thought possible.



But some did. I always answered those.



I had no idea what I was. I knew that I was more than I had been. More than myself. And I knew that I was powerful. I even started to wonder if I was a god. Under the circumstances, I think that was a reasonable thing to wonder.



But whether I was a god or not, I could still only be in one place at one time.



That’s why I needed the pigeons.



Pigeons can only be in one place, too. But there are so many of them that they’re already everywhere. 



I asked them to listen. They answered me.



Because they answered me, I was able to answer so many others.



I answered a boy being beaten by cops as a flock of pigeons watched silently from the roofs above. His dog lay beside him, bleeding from bullet holes and panting raggedly. The boy was holding his dog even though the cops kept hitting his hands. He begged for help. He asked for his mother. He told his dog she was a good girl as she whined, blood spreading across the dirty concrete.



Still, they beat him.



So I struck them down.



One cracked open on the sidewalk. I took his gun and shot the other while he stirred feebly. 



The boy looked at me, exhausted and horrified in equal measure, began to pray. I knew he was praying to God, probably to stop me from closer. But I pretended he was praying to me anyway.



I kneeled down and placed my hands on his poor, whining dog.



“Don’t hurt her,” he wept as agony tunneled through my belly, rotten and corrosive and vile. “Please. She’s a good girl.”



“I know,” I told him, then touched his forehead the way I touched my son’s when he’d been running a fever. Another bolt of pain shot through my hand. I saw the wound form this time, watched it cave through my palm and spread.



The dog got to her feet and nuzzled her owner, tail wagging even as she whined.



The boy looked at me, wide-eyed and ashen. “What are you?”



I didn’t know how to answer. To be honest, I didn’t want to.



I hobbled my way out of the alley, down a side street and into a narrow little park. The pigeons followed. Mr. One-Eye gave his wing-flapping, face-slapping order. The feathers came, and with it healing.



The birds kept listening, and I kept answering.



They found a woman, dead-eyed and frozen in fear, huddling as a man with dead eyes bore down on her. I tore his head off. She ran before I could put my hands on her to take away her fear.



They found a flea-bitten baby boy in a sodden, sagging diaper screaming for help in a filthy crib while his parents nodded off in an equally filthy corner. I answered the baby, but I punished them. 



They found a girl in a group home as she slid a blade up and down her arms and asked for someone who should have done everything to protect her but destroyed her instead to die. I answered.



They found an old woman with a black eye pushing an empty cart along broken sidewalks, asking for her belongings to come back. I answered, but not before punishing the thieves.



They found a man sobbing alone in his car, silently pleading for money to feed his kids for the next three days, just the next three days, please God. I answered. My answer was taken from someone else, but it was given.



They found a mother sobbing for help over her son’s blue body, a needle still quivering in his arm. I answered her, too. Afterward I found the man who sold her son the drugs, and then I found the people who sold that man the drugs, and then I found the people who gave *them* the drugs, and those people were no more.



I answered pleas against crime bosses and schoolyard bullies, masked monsters and petty criminals, people who inflicted damage by action and people who inflicted damage by inaction.



Dozens, then hundreds, then more. And more.



And more.



Every answer took from me. I think every answer continued to take. Maybe it’s because I’ve given so many answers and now they all help each other grow. My answers took and took what I can never get back. Even the birds couldn’t give back what I gave. 



But they gave me enough.



Right up until the day your people found me.



That was my fault. God works best in mysterious ways, especially when those ways are small. I am still mysterious, but I forgot to stay small. I will never make that mistake again.





My birds still bring me questions, you know. They’re outside right now. On your walls, your roof, your ground, whispering to each other. Whispering to Mr. One-Eye. Whispering to me.



I hear them, even down here. 



They aren’t perfect. Nobody is. Some questions don’t have answers, and some answers can’t be found.



My son was one of those.



We tried to find him. My pigeons worked as hard as I ever did. Harder, maybe. We couldn’t find him. But my boy, he would understand. My boy, he saw the good in everyone and everything. Wherever he is, he sees the good in us not finding him. Because while looking for him — searching for an answer, any answer at all — we were able to give other people the answers they needed.



You know about those answers. That’s why I’m here.



I love these birds as much as my son ever did, maybe more. I think more. I feel him in them sometimes, or at least I imagine that I do. Holding pigeons, teaching pigeons, loving pigeons, isn’t like having my son back. Nothing will ever be like having him back. But it is the closest thing I have. It is all I have. Sometimes what we have is all we get.



And sometimes, I am the only thing someone gets. Well, me and the birds.



My son knew what he was talking about. These birds are wonderful. They really do think everyone is their friend. They love being held. They love being taught. They love being loved. They love to help.



And they love to listen.



Together, my birds and I are always listening to those who ask for answers. We hear them. Right now, they’re whispering, right this very minute. We hear them, even down here. I hear their pain, and I hear their rage. That’s why you cannot keep me forever, no matter how hard you try:



Because hearing their suffering gives me power, and I still hear every minute of the suffering. 



I hear the children who beg for help.



I hear the fathers who cry for justice



I hear the mothers who demand vengeance



I hear, because I am One Who Listens.



And I help, because I am The One Who Answers.

It seems strange, or maybe just wrong, for it to nearly be the end of June and I've not written about you or to you this year. I'm not even taking myself away to the beach to mourn you this year. It just didn't feel right and I'm not really sure why. I did decide to spend the weekend in a hotel instead of steaming my clam in my clam shack aka the tin can I'm living in. 

I took today and Monday off, today for self care, grace and love and Monday for a girl's day with one of my favorite people. I think this may be the last year I do anything special for this anniversary, so much of me has changed and you're just another ghost. 

You've been gone almost an entire decade but I still remember everything like it was just yesterday. From the day we met to the day of your death, it's all still so fresh. You were such a good manipulator and liar, truly the best. I was naive and starved for love. But our stars were crossed and once you had a hold of me, you were never going to let go. 

To this day I argue that you loved me as best as you could even though I know that isn't real or true. Love wasn't something you could do or feel. I still romanticize you, believing that you tried to change for me … but being locked up was what you really needed. I often wonder if you'd still be alive if your family hadn't bailed you out. 

You'd been clean for 3 months at that point. You were good to me then, so fucking good and I thank you so much for those memories and for showing me that side of you. It broke my heart in the absolute worst way when I knew you'd started using again. I knew then that I'd lost you, I just didn't know how bad it would get for both of us before it was all said and done. 

Today is 06/28/2024. Despite all I've lived through, the worst day of my life remains as 06/29/2015. You and I hadn't talked much in the week leading up - you'd taken off to use again, back in Portland and I had decided I was done, for good, I wasn't coming back to you and I wasn't going to let you come back. And I meant it, too and I think you knew that, I think that's at least part of why you did what you did. 

You messaged me that day, from your mom's phone, said you wanted to see me but I told you no. I could feel your angst, I could feel your anger and hatred. You showed up anyway, where did you get that key, by the way? I tried to keep you out, I knew I was in danger, this wasn't the first time you tried to end my life. 

But you got in and as soon as you were inside the abuse began. You put me through 3 hours of hell. I knew, and I mean I knew that I was going to die that day. I had no doubt. I begged for my life, I begged you to consider my family, that I needed to be alive for them and I remember your response being only “fuck your kids”. You claimed to love them once, same as you did me - but I don't think people like you can actually love anyone. 

I can't recall how many times you choked me to the point of unconsciousness but I do remember waking up 4 different times and immediately being kicked in the chest and stomach. You stomped on my recently healed ribs and broke them again, you were the reason they'd been broken before. You told me of your plans that day, to take my life and then your own, but you couldn't decide if you would use your knife or your gun. 

This wasn't your first time hurting me, but it was the worst and thankfully, it was the last. You held your tec-22 to my head and said “I am going to die today, even if you don't, and I want you to know that it's your fault”. But then you did something I didn't expect … you had to know I would run if I got the chance … you had to. It's probably just me doing what I do and seeing or believing in good where there was none, but you had to know. 

I was living in a 19 foot trailer when I first moved here, that trailer only had one internal door and you went into the bathroom and closed that door. You had to know I would run! And I did. Barefoot across gravel and goat heads and right into a neighbor's house. I'd never met them before but their door was unlocked and I ran inside begging for help and telling them to get down and away from the doors/windows. 

You walked out so calm, no emotion on your face, like nothing had just happened inside that hellish place. You got in your car and drove away, the sirens already wailing in the distance. Paramedics arrived and took me to the hospital, surprisingly my ribs were the only part of me that you broke physically. I remember sitting alone in that hospital room and I felt you curse me, then I felt you leave. 

They kept me in that hospital room for quite a long time, considerably longer than needed and I knew something was wrong when a cop walked in somberly. They told me you had shot yourself. They couldn't say what your condition was, they didn't know, they could only say that you'd been life flighted to Portland. 

In your final act you saved 4 lives and helped another person be able to see again. But I *hope* none of those people carry you with them, they don't deserve that. And while I may love you, still, I'm thankful that I survived and I healed. I wish you were still alive, not so I could be with you, but for your mother's sake. You destroyed her by doing what you did. You were her one and only. I still talk to her, y'know, we meet for coffee and lunch a couple of times a year. She's still as sweet as ever and she misses you dearly. 

I still don't really know how I made it through all of that alone … I had no friends here, no family, nothing. I went through the darkest time of my life completely and utterly alone. I barely made it, but that's an entry for another day. It took years … but I made it through and I healed, that's what matters most. 

I still miss you, the good you, but I don't miss the bad you. And if you were still here today, I'd wish you happiness even though I wouldn't ever want to see you again. You didn't deserve to die and I'll always be sad that you saw that as your only option. I know how that feels, but again, that's an entry for another day. Today is just about you, Romey. 

To the moon and back again, forever and for always. That's what we said. Part of me will always be yours and I will carry you with me until my dying day. I will forever mourn the version of me that died with you that day. And I will forever *hope* to never meet you again. You were my flame and you did exactly what you were meant to do. We both burned, you just burned too bright.

- we have elementary aged kids and would like a solid school district, preferably with good arts programs. Big plus if there are neighborhoods where kids can safely walk to school.

- budget is $3800 or less for a 3 bedroom house

- some walkable access to public parks and maybe a coffee shop or two would be great. Not expecting to be able to walk everywhere but having at least some options for a nice walk would be ideal. I love having some sort of outdoor access, trails, water, etc 

- less than a 30 minute commute to the University District by car or public transit would be great

- if it exists, it would be great to have a neighborhood with community events or some good options for meeting other people from time to time

I (25F) share a condo with my roommate Sara (26F). Sara and I have been friends for a few years, and since we live together, she offered to throw me a small birthday party at our place. I was on board with it because I don’t like huge gatherings and prefer intimate celebrations with close friends. I have slight social anxiety as well.

Leading up to the party, I asked her what the plans were, and she assured me it would be a ""small get-together,"" just a few of our mutual friends, cake, and maybe a movie. That sounded perfect to me.

Well, the day of the party rolls around, and when I came home, I quickly realized it was *anything* but small. Sara had invited a ton of people—at least 50. Some were mutual friends, but a lot were people I barely knew or hadn’t even met before. She had also set up a bunch of party decorations, hired a DJ, and there was even a huge table of food and drinks. It felt like a full-blown house party, not the chill gathering I was expecting.

I immediately felt overwhelmed. I don’t do well in big social situations, especially when I’m the center of attention, and this was way more than I had anticipated. I pulled Sara aside and asked her why she invited so many people when we had agreed on something small. She shrugged it off and said, “Oh, come on, it’s your birthday! I wanted to make it special!”

I appreciated the effort, but this wasn’t what I wanted at all. I felt completely uncomfortable and anxious. After trying to stick it out for a bit, I just couldn’t handle it and decided to leave. I ended up going to a nearby coffee shop to calm down and clear my head.

After I left, Sara texted me, asking where I was. I told her that I wasn’t comfortable with the party and that I needed some space. She was upset and said I was being ungrateful for everything she did for me. Now some of our friends are saying I overreacted and that Sara was just trying to be nice by throwing me a big party.

I feel bad for leaving, but I also feel like she completely ignored what I wanted. AITA for walking out of my own birthday party because it wasn’t the ""small"" event I expected?

It is completely okay to beat and torture these women- the only ones who you know can give birth. 

And they could be pregnant at any moment, and yet they still allowed to be treated like shit. No wine or coffee but its cool if the wife smashes her head into a wall. For an aunt to burn their hands and shock them with cattle prods. 

You would think think that since they are considered such valuable resources they would be treated better. Like yeah you don't need eyes and non burned skin to give birth, but like... its best not to be extremely stressed. I get they are basically cattle, but still. 

And then all these infertile women- the Wives- are some of the highest ranking people in the society?? Like they care so much about fertility, you would think they would annul the marriages and marry the men to the fertile women. Still assault and evil but... It seems much more sound. 

And then these infertile men are in charge and the seemingly fertile ones are drivers? I understand this is an inherently Christian society which is about overpowering women and white supremist but like... why not test the men? And make the fertile ones in charge? Was that never an idea? You would think something like sexual vitality and fertility would be status symbols.

I'm sitting alone on this warm Saturday morning, enjoying my routine hippy speed-ball (a cup of coffee and a joint) and I'm trying to fight my mind's natural desire to ruminate and analyze. I only fight it now because I woke up with him on my mind and I know I'll just end up crying and I really don't want to do that today. 

I know I'll end up crying at some point today … but I really do try to fight it. The ache is heavy today, it was heavy yesterday too. I still don't understand why some days are so much harder than other days. Or why, on days like today, it feels exactly the same as the day he first went away. 

I used to really enjoy my periods of rumination, they were times of deep thought and healthy processing. Now it's obsessive, dark and negative. All because of one heartbreak. That's how trauma works sometimes and this one heartbreak basically destroyed years of work. 

Why's this shit gotta be so hard? Just don't fuck with people. Don't fuck with their hearts, don't fuck with their heads. Don't ever assume to know a person's strength or ability to overcome – you never know … you just never fucking know. 

If you can't love someone, then just leave them the fuck alone. That's my new motto. It really is just that fucking simple. I am so tired of people who lie. “I love you” spoken from a forked tongue is a quick and deadly poison for some … especially for someone who's only ever wanted love … for someone like me. 

I know I'm a little bit different from other people, I get that … I don't expect people to be like me or to think or to feel anything the same way I do. But I just don't understand dishonesty, especially in matters of the heart. I know I've hurt a heart or two in my lifetime, but not through dishonesty, quite the opposite actually. 

I really do try to live my life in such a way that I don't have to apologize for anything. I try to live authentically and without regret. I sometimes wish things were different but I don't regret anything. I've never struggled with accepting things or people as they are. The only person I've ever tried to change is myself. I have tried to live as gently as I possibly can … and life has met me with incredible violence. 

I don't and won't let it harden me. I have lost so much along the way but I swear I'll never lose my softness. Life can beat me into nothing, I don't care. My heart is too broken to love again, my light has gone dim, my eyes are blind and my soul dances between extremes, an undulating ball of sorrow that burns both hot and cold. 

I remain soft, I remain gentle. But I am closed. I can't afford to bring anyone else in. Life has already taken the best of me, I've got to protect what's left of me. I always wanted to give all that I could and all that I had … just not like this. I only wanted someone to love my softness. 

I didn't make it through writing this with a dry eye, obviously I cried. 

Anyfuck, I'm off to get ready for a night of drinking, debauchery and degeneracy. It'll probably just be a night of drinking but a girl can always hope for extra D.

I've been casually using the dreaming Spanish platform for a bit over a year but only more seriously for the past six months. 

Throughout this time I often found myself scrolling through the endless options trying to find something interesting and often stopping videos halfway if I had troubles engaging or understanding the content. This led to a lot of decision making fatigue and very slowly increasing my input time. 

Everything changed for me when I discovered the sorting videos from easy to hard function. 

Now I simply sit down in the morning with a cup of coffee and watch the next video in line often getting an hour or more of effortless input daily. What I'm learning is that the most engaging videos are the ones I can best understand. It's been so motivating to learn new words everyday and consistently deepen my comprehension.

My sister and I were best friends. She was my entire world. I can’t remember a time when I didn’t first go to her with my problems, and when she wasn’t happy and ready to listen. There were some days when I couldn’t go on without talking to her. Not to be too cheesy, but she was my rock. I loved my sister with my whole heart. She was always very private, and didn’t share a lot with me, but I was told to respect that want. She loved me, and I knew we were close. We had a bond. She was my role model. She’d volunteer on the weekends, donate to charity, and was just an awesome person. My sister passed away last week, and it was insanely hard to process. My parents asked me to go and sort her possessions, and even though it felt hard, I agreed because I knew she wouldn’t want anybody else doing it.

I, of course, became somewhat of a snoop. I mean, I knew it was wrong, but I wanted to know something about my sister. Her laptop was out on the coffee table, and I just had to look at it! Her password was easy to guess, and I got lucky. She had her messages synced to her laptop, so I went through them. Again, bad thing to do. I shouldn’t have done it. But I did it, and I wish I never did. She was blackmailing her ex with his nudes, threatening to leak them if he didn’t give her the dog they’d bought together. She was harassing a woman at her work, trying to force her to quit. She also claimed to having an affair with her married boss and the head of their HR department, so if she went to either of them, she would just get them to fire her. It was horrible. In her conversations with her friends, she would bully and make fun of them, then turn around and act like their friend. She would make fun of me and our parents, post pictures of me and describe everything wrong with me. If I told her something, it got back to her friends and they would pile on and insult me. She made catfish profiles on dating apps. She made fake accounts on numerous websites to bully a girl from her high school (she still lived in our hometown- I found the list of accounts in her computer’s notes). It was horrific. I felt like I was looking at a stranger’s computer.

I don’t know how to process it. This isn’t half as hard as dealing with her death, but it just feels like such a sucker punch and I don’t know how to deal. I’m planning to seek therapy, but just some slightly urgent help might be useful. How do I feel... Okay about this? How do I reconcile the image of my angel sister with this? What should my next steps be?

TL;DR: I found out that my deceased sister is a bully, a blackmailer, and just an overall not very kind person.

My very good friend told me I need to take all my crazy writings and publish them … she loves everything I write though, I feel like her opinion is a bit biased perhaps, which I don't mind. It's a strange thought for me because I really only write for him. 

But I can't deny that since I met him the floodgates have been open, it's been an unstoppable force, this compulsion to write. Don't get me wrong, writing has always been a wonderful and healing outlet for me, but this is different … the way I write is different, the frequency, the tone, the *need* to get it all out of my head … it's all so different. 

I've dated and fucked a lot of men, I've only loved a select few, but none like this and none of them compelled me the way he did, the way he still does despite his absence and silence. 

I've never fallen so quickly, so completely, so pathetically … I don't understand. I've spent the greater part of a year trying to understand, trying to move on, trying everything I can to ease this ache … to no avail.

I wanted to be on my knees for him, but not like this. I wanted to choke on his cock, not the grief of his absence. Why's it so hard to find someone who will break my back and not my heart? 

This is so fucking dumb, I am so fucking dumb. How did I get so hung up on this man? I don't understand. It's just so fucking dumb. 

Love is so fucking dumb. 

And I miss it so fucking much. I miss him … I just want to be next to him again and have his arms around me again … and everything else and morning sex, oh god I miss our morning fucks! I never wanted to make someone their morning coffee before him. I never wanted to wake a man up with a blow job before him.

Extra: I remember many years ago when I tried Jack Daniels and didn't like it, just felt a massive Acetone taste, but since that was long ago, I might need to give it another shot XD ",1,1732327892.0,whisky,2,1.0,False
1gxoxda,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1gxoxda/the_feeling_of_loss_after_a_vacation/,The feeling of loss after a vacation,"Has anyone ever experienced a feeling of loss or sorrow after a vacation? I came back from one a couple of weeks ago and while I think some of this is attributed to travel fatigue, I think some was just looking back and aspects of it and feeling.. forlorn?

I think it stems from a sense of freedom that is literally encompassed in the concept of vacation. It is a very distilled period of freedom and change that feels like a chocolate cake tastes.. You think you want this forever, but the beauty lies in the fact that it is something that is temporary. Maybe it also highlighted things that were missing?

It wasn't a cruise, or a resort. It was travelling to a city I have been to before, along with a few other places. I mostly travelled around from coffee shop to coffee shop and loved walking from place to place. I also loved being disconnected from work and not even worrying about it. The change of pace and scenery were lovely. I am worried I may not get to do something like this again for a long time... it was quite an expensive endeavor. I think I am worried that doing something like this again may be out of reach.

I may not have given myself enough time when I got back. Just one day between landing from a transatlantic flight to hitting the pavement again with work. I want things to slow down. 

I loved it. I don't want to sound like I didn't like it. It was refreshing in its own way, but I once I hit the seat in the plane... I felt like I was clawing at the ground while slowly falling off a cliff.

# 

La cultura popular está llena de símbolos que, aunque parecen inofensivos, esconden significados más profundos y, a menudo, oscuros. Uno de ellos es el icónico logo de Starbucks, una sirena de dos colas con corona, que remite a la figura mitológica de **Melusina**. Esta criatura, una mujer-serpiente o mujer-dragón, vivía bajo un hechizo, representando un enigma que ha fascinado a los estudiosos del simbolismo durante siglos. Pero ¿qué hay realmente detrás de este símbolo?

# Melusina: La Sirena de Dos Colas

En el folklore medieval, Melusina era una mujer maldita que se transformaba en un ser mitad humano, mitad serpiente o dragón. Se dice que habitaba en las aguas y que su condición estaba ligada a secretos, pactos y magia. La figura de Melusina está impregnada de **dualidad**, algo que se refleja en la sirena de dos colas.

# Las Dos Colas: Dualidad del Mundo Caído

Las dos colas de la sirena no son meros adornos. Simbolizan la **dualidad intrínseca del mundo caído** en el que vivimos. Blanco y negro, bien y mal, agua y fuego: estas polaridades forman parte del equilibrio ilusorio que gobierna nuestra existencia. La sirena de dos colas representa, en este contexto, la naturaleza dividida de la humanidad y de su entorno, siempre en conflicto entre dos extremos.

Este simbolismo también apunta a la **liberación sexual**, un tema recurrente en los rituales y símbolos de fertilidad desde tiempos antiguos. La sirena con las dos colas extendidas puede interpretarse como un símbolo de exhibicionismo, una representación de la feminidad desplegada y ofrecida como parte de un culto al cuerpo y a la sexualidad.

# La Adoración a Aserá y Lilith

Detrás de este tipo de simbolismo se encuentra la veneración de figuras como **Aserá** y **Lilith**, antiguas diosas relacionadas con la fertilidad, la sexualidad y la rebelión contra lo divino. En las culturas semíticas, Aserá era considerada la diosa madre, asociada con árboles sagrados y rituales de fertilidad. Lilith, por otro lado, es vista como una figura de seducción y poder femenino, pero también de desobediencia y caos.

El logo de Starbucks, al igual que otros símbolos modernos, tiene raíces en estas representaciones antiguas. La exhibición de la sirena de dos colas no solo es un recordatorio de la fertilidad y la sexualidad, sino también una referencia a rituales mágicos y al culto a lo femenino como fuerza desatada y no controlada.

# Hechicería y el Lenguaje Simbólico

La conexión entre el logo de Starbucks y la magia no es mera coincidencia. Todo símbolo tiene un propósito oculto, un mensaje codificado que solo puede entenderse a través del estudio del lenguaje simbólico. En este caso, la sirena representa mucho más que una figura mitológica:

1. **Dualidad**: La separación entre opuestos, simbolizando el eterno conflicto del bien y el mal.
2. **Ritualismo**: Las dos colas abiertas son una representación de los rituales antiguos de fertilidad, en los que se celebraba la vida, pero también el poder de los deseos carnales.
3. **Hechicería oculta**: Como Melusina, la sirena está ligada a los misterios del agua, el poder femenino y los secretos guardados en los antiguos cultos paganos.

# El Trasfondo de los Símbolos Modernos

El logo de Starbucks es un recordatorio de cómo los símbolos antiguos son reutilizados en el mundo moderno para atraer nuestra atención y energía, muchas veces de manera inconsciente. Lo que aparenta ser un diseño atractivo y comercial lleva consigo un trasfondo que conecta con tradiciones mágicas y rituales ancestrales. Desde los rituales de fertilidad hasta la veneración de diosas como Aserá y Lilith, este tipo de simbolismo es más profundo de lo que parece.

# Conclusión: Más Que un Café

Cada vez que sostienes un vaso de Starbucks, no solo estás consumiendo café; estás interactuando con un símbolo que representa mucho más que una marca. La sirena de dos colas es un recordatorio de la dualidad, la hechicería y los antiguos cultos que todavía influyen en el mundo moderno, aunque disfrazados bajo una apariencia de normalidad.

**¿Es casualidad o intención? Esa pregunta depende de ti.** Pero recuerda, el mundo está lleno de significados ocultos que solo pueden revelarse a través del estudio y la reflexión. ¿Estás listo para ver más allá de lo que te muestran?El Logo de Starbucks y la Sirena de Dos Colas: Un Símbolo de Dualidad y Hechicería

1gxowmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waypointunknown/comments/1gxowmd/chapter_6_inner_demons/,Chapter 6: Inner Demons,"Daniel walks down the street carrying a plastic bag, dressed in a hoodie, sweatpants, and sneakers to avoid drawing attention. 

After walking for a while, he arrives at a motel, heads to a room, and pulls a key from one of his pockets to open the door and enter. Upon entering the room, Daniel places the bag on a table and, after taking off his sneakers, he collapses onto the bed, exhausted. 

He falls deeply asleep and begins to dream of himself dressed in his Maverick suit, descending a set of stairs to where women and children are locked in cells. All these people are in very poor condition. Just as he is about to free them, armed men appear behind Maverick and point their weapons at him. 

Furious, Maverick transforms into Berserker and charges at his enemies, brutally eliminating them. Once the danger has passed, Maverick returns to normal and opens all the cells, healing the wounded. However, when he opens one of the cells, he finds a girl lying on the cold floor. 

Despite using his abilities to heal her, the girl does not wake up and Maverick begins to cry because he wants to save the little girl, but everything is in vain and Maverick is left alone in the middle of the darkness crying. 



Lamia: So many powers and you couldn't save her. How pathetic... but if you let me help you, I could save the little girl's life. 



A cadaverous humanoid being appears behind Maverick, proposing a deal. But our hero makes his katana appear and tries to cut the entity, which vanishes and reappears in front of him. 



Lamia: Calm down, Daniel... or should I say Maverick? 



Maverick: (angry) I know your kind, you're a Lamia. 



Lamia: (surprised) I'm surprised you know what I am. 



Maverick: (angry) A supernatural thug who preys on others, a pathetic being! 



Lamia: Take it easy... I'm just a messenger, and I came to... 



Maverick: (angry) Save it, I want nothing from you. So if you value your life, get out of here and don't bother me again. 



Lamia: Look, I just want to help you. You and I both know you need the help, and I'm here to lend a hand. So all you have to do is make a pact with me, and I'll give you what you need. 



Maverick: (angry) I know what making a pact means and I also know what Lamias do. 



Lamia: Then you know you have two options: we can do this the easy way or the hard way. 



Maverick: (angry) It seems you don't listen well... screw you! 



Lamia: Hard way it is. 



The darkness disappears, and both Maverick and the Lamia are transported to a metal platform suspended by chains and below this platform is molten steel, and the entire environment resembles a foundry. 



Lamia: Welcome to Wonderland, Maverick. 



Maverick: Look, wannabe Krueger, don't think I'm afraid of you. 



Lamia: You should be. One way or another, I'm going to convince you to make a pact with me, and the more you refuse, the more I'll mutilate your body. So don't make this harder and accept my deal. 



Maverick: (angry) How I hate beings like you who think they're superior to us humans, but in reality, you're nothing but scum! 



The Lamia floats in the air and chains appear out of nowhere to trap Maverick's arms and legs with the intention of causing him great pain, but Maverick only laughs and mocks the Lamia. 



Maverick: Seriously, Pinhead? 



Lamia: (surprised) I warned you, Maverick, you're the one who doesn't know... 



Maverick: You're the one who hasn't realized, I'm not locked in here with you... you're locked in here with me! 



Using his strength, Maverick breaks the chains, makes his katana appear, and charges at full speed towards the Lamia, who responds by making more chains appear to try to strike Maverick. But our hero's speed is greater and upon reaching the Lamia, Maverick slashes the creature's chest, causing it to fall to the ground while a tar-like substance oozes from the wound. 



Maverick: I warned you. 



Just as the Lamia is about to be annihilated, the creature transports itself and Maverick back to the motel, where Maverick can see himself lying on the bed, only his body appears transparent. 



Lamia: Not so fast, Maverick. You don’t have control here. Now that we’re in our astral forms, you can't do anything about it. I'll cut your silver cord, and once I separate your soul from your body, I'll use your body as a disguise and do terrible things in your name. No one will know it's really me, and you'll be left as a wandering soul on this planet. 



A line of energy can be seen connecting Maverick's astral form to his body lying on the bed. The Lamia uses its bony hands to try to cut Maverick's silver cord, but despite its efforts, the creature cannot achieve its goal. 



Lamia: (surprised) What the hell? Why can’t I do it? 



Maverick: It won't be that easy to break my silver cord, fiend. 



Suddenly, Maverick loses consciousness, and a different voice emerges from the body lying on the bed. 



Killer: Here's Killer. 



Daniel's body rises from the bed and grabs the Lamia by the neck. The Lamia, unsure of what is happening, sees Daniel's features turn terrifying. His teeth become sharp fangs, his eyes change to resemble a snake, and a malevolent smile spreads across his face. 



Lamia: (surprised) You shouldn't be able to harm me in my astral form. 



Killer: You have no idea what I can do, and the name is Killer. 



The Lamia looks directly into Killer's eyes and begins to tremble with fear. Killer laughs maniacally, further frightening the creature and in an instant they are transported back to the nightmare place with the metal platform above a pool of molten steel. 



Lamia: (terrified) What's happening? 



The Lamia turns around scared of what is happening, and Maverick appears, stabbing it in the chest with his sword, looking the creature in the eyes. 



Maverick: When you get to hell, tell them Maverick sent you. 



Maverick withdraws his sword from the Lamia's chest, and the creature stumbles to the edge of the platform, falling into the molten steel and being destroyed forever. 

Moments later, Daniel wakes up suddenly and realizes he is in the motel room and that the Lamia has been eliminated. 



Maverick: Damn... how I hate those entities that attack you in your dreams or when you're vulnerable. 



Daniel gets up from the bed and heads to the bathroom to splash water on his face. Afterward, he leaves the bathroom, but in the mirror, Daniel's reflection remains visible. The face changes to Killer's, who breaks the fourth wall by looking directly at the viewers. He makes a shushing gesture with his index finger and then disappears before Daniel returns to turn off the bathroom light. 

The scene shifts to a roadside diner where Samael, the man from the previous chapter, is having a coffee and enjoying a pie while talking on the phone with Volkermord and another person referred to as Paracelsus about the Lamia he sent to Maverick and how overcame the test brilliantly. 



Paracelsus: Sending a Lamia was a bit excessive, Samael. 



Samael: It was necessary to test Maverick's willpower, although I had already noticed that this Maverick has faced much more dangerous threats than a simple Lamia. 



Volkermord: The point is, he's ready for the next phase and has passed all the tests we've set for him with flying colors. 



Samael: Let's hope he's the one to break the Ouroboros cycle, or we'll disappear. 



Volkermord: I'm sure of it; otherwise, we wouldn't be here talking, and we would have been reset. 



Samael puts away his phone, finishes his dessert and coffee, then pays the waitress, leaving a tip so large that she can't believe it. 



Waitress: Sir, sir! 



Just as the waitress steps out of the establishment to return Samael's money, he has disappeared, leaving behind a note that says, ""Thanks for the pie, it was delicious. Keep the change""",1,1732327816.0,Waypointunknown,0,1.0,False

I (22F) recently became a SAHM while I was pregnant with my now 3month old daughter (she turned 3months a few days ago) I had a high risk pregnancy (weak placenta IUGR had fetal monitoring multiple times a week and live in a red state so maternal care isn’t great here and had to drive over an hour multiple times a week to see the OB and MFM because no OBs here wanted to risk taking me as a patient) 

Before I met my fiance I was a single mom to my now 6year old son. I finished school, went to college and trade school and was really independent and was a single mom since I was pregnant with him (also a high risk pregnancy he was born at 32 weeks due to me having preeclampsia) I was really proud of myself beating all the odds and how successful I became despite how I grew up in a not so good situation. Part of the reason I became a teen mom. I had a cosmetology license and a good savings due to my mom passing away when I was 14. 

When I stopped working while I was pregnant my savings disappeared because I had to buy everything alone for my daughter because my fiance claimed he couldn’t afford it idk how because he makes decent money at his main job we live in a relatively cheaper state (Iowa) and he has a second job he works from home after his other job a couple days a week when he’s needed for a record label doing marketing, cyber security, social media stuff. He said the reason why he didn’t have money to help is because he was saving up to buy a house. Somehow he says we’re always broke days after he gets paid and I just don’t understand how. Today he told me the child support I get I think is “just free money that falls out of the sky I can spend on whatever I want” because my sons dad actually paid it and I said I needed to buy him Christmas presents with it. I only get $102 a week when my son’s dad actually decides to pay it. Sometimes it’s less. I don’t get my hair done, nails done, don’t wear makeup anymore, don’t have a skincare routine, use extra hair products anymore, I’m still squeezing into clothes from before I was pregnant and wearing my “postpartum underwear” because it’s all that fits me. I get Dunkin sometimes once a week sometimes two if I have really rough nights with the baby. When I actually do get child support I use it for gas money to get my son to school, groceries and clothes for the kids if they need them and my son’s hockey. I haven’t got my hair and toes done since before my baby shower for the baby shower. Since I have a cosmetology license I’m able to buy my shampoo from the salon cheaper in liter bottles for cheaper and they last me 6-8months ($30 for both shampoo and conditioner) and brought up to him I needed to buy more soon and he told me I needed to find cheaper stuff at the regular store instead like fine okay I’ll do that but I don’t see how me spending only $30 on myself every 6-8months is a big deal. Not being able to have my normal hair/skin products or getting my toes done once a month was really the last thing I had to my old identity since becoming a SAHM since you have to look nice and put together as a cosmetologist. I feel like a shell of a human. I get to shower maybe once a week if I’m lucky because whenever I do shower my baby is just screaming the whole time because “I don’t have boobs” he doesn’t get up at all at night to help with the baby because “I don’t have boobs” I haven’t had time away from my baby since she was born except showering super fast for ten minutes because I can’t stand just listening to her cry knowing she isn’t being comforted. If I need to shave my legs and take longer he flips out. I accidentally left my glasses at the hospital when I had my daughter and her horrible migraines now because I haven’t been able to see in three months and says me buying new glasses would be a waste of money. I also have a restriction on my license that I can’t drive without them or get my license suspended because my eyesight is absolutely terrible (when I had preeclampsia with my son it messed them up really bad and I have state insurance they don’t cover dental or eye) my fiance goes to the casino, gets to go on work trips for the record label to Miami and LA, has Dior and gucci and LV and supreme stuff. One of his hats is $1000 but me spending $30 on shampoo every 6 months is a problem. On his days off he refuses to help me with anything because “it’s my day off I’m not doing anything” and plays video games. My birthday is in 5 days and I asked if I could get a cold brew coffee maker (found one for $40) and coffee and creamers and cold foam so I could make myself coffee at home instead of buying a coffee once or twice a week and said it would be a waste of money and doesn’t understand why I even need it even though he buys himself energy drinks/coffees everyday and says “well I need it because I work”. Everyone recently got sick and my daughter started teething super super early and she was extremely fussy and our house got messy and he called his mom and said horrible things about me “her one job is to keep the house cleaned and she hasn’t even been doing that” taking care of him, my son, my daughter all sick while my daughter is teething before she even knows how to completely hold teethers to chew on and on top of breastfeeding was a lot. I feel like he just sees me as a stay at home maid instead of mom. Since he said that I’ve been refusing to clean up anything after him except dishes. I leave all his drinks on his computer desk don’t do his laundry don’t clean his hair out of the sink or his clothes up he leaves all over the house or garbage he leaves everywhere and tells me I’m “lazy” because our house looks horrible. He also canceled my birthday plans days in advance and told me he took an extra shift to give the other boss the night off so he could get overtime so he had extra money for his upcoming trip. After I begged my little sister to come up and watch our kids for it so I could have just one night off since I’ve been pregnant. I’m scared to leave his aunt is a lawyer and I’m terrified they’d take my daughter from me. I can’t afford court again I spent nearly $30k in court and lawyer fees for my son because his dad drug it out so long and building a new clientele would take forever again I’d barely make anything for at least a year. I don’t have access to any money after my savings ran up he had me drive to my hometown and close my account and get on his bank account with him but he stopped using his bank account and transfers everything to his cashapp and only uses his cashapp card. He keeps my son’s child support card in his wallet too so I can’t even lie about that and say I’m not getting it and save it up. He also had me shut my phone off and get onto his phone plan so he can see all my texts and can see when it texts me that the money loaded onto it. I have no family to go to my mom passed when I was 14 my dad disowned me for being a teen mom and my grandma who did help me before I was 18 had a heart attack and has too many health problems to worry about my problems. I don’t know what to do. ",2,1732327754.0,sahm,3,1.0,False

Logline: *A vengeful witch tries to kill a promising young intern after he is selected over her at a job interview for a prestigious marketing firm.*

Synopsis:

High school graduate Jayden Kirk attends an interview at a prestigious advertising firm under the direction of Mitchell ""Mitch"" Graystorm, CEO where he quickly meets Azalea Drummond, a mysterious woman (also there for an interview) with a bizarre fetish for trench-coats. After the interview, Jayden confesses his woes to his friend Leah during lunch where he learns that she is writing a report on the Salem Witch Trials. Meanwhile, Mitch promptly informs Azalea that she was passed over, much to her shock. Azalea, furious, decides to get revenge on Jayden, knowing that he most likely landed the job. Azalea soon arrives at Jayden's house and quickly reveals herself to be a witch, using a spell to destroy Jayden's washing machine. However, Leah shows up, quickly blowing her cover. Not too long after, Jayden starts his first day at the firm where quickly meets Mitch's secretary Dora, Star Trek fanboy and chief editor Rich, graphic designer Cheyenne, and carefree assistant Abby. While a mysterious computer glitch plagues the building, Azalea soon arrives at the tower and passes on a gift to Jayden in the form of a cursed talisman. Suddenly, an accident in the form of an exploding aquarium leaves Dora hospital-bound and Jayden searching for answers which eventually leads him to Cheyenne who happens to be an expert on witchcraft (since she's a Wiccan herself). Cheyenne tells Jayden the power of the talisman and instructs him to burn it in order to stop him from dying. Meanwhile, the office continues to fall apart as the copy machine malfunctions and a projector during a meeting with an important executive explodes, leading Jayden to a coffee shop where he, funny enough, runs into Azalea of all people. There, Azalea reveals part of her intentions to Jayden with a ominous message near the end. Jayden, suspicious, takes note of it as he visits Dora in the hospital and soon returns back to the office. While he attempts to settle back in, the office is soon overwhelmed by a swarm of spiders, coming straight out of Jayden's backpack. Things eventually take a turn of the worse for Jayden when he attempts to start his car after work. Not surprisingly, it explodes, but miraculously Jayden is unharmed. Leah, feeling sorry for Jayden, cooks up a dinner for him in the form of soup with a deadly ingredient, Foxglove, given to her by Azalea at the grocery store. Leah, oblivious to what the dangerous herb is, serves it to Jayden who quickly finds himself on the floor, covered in his own blood, gasping for life. Leah eventually manages to save him as the police track down Azalea and eventually, capture her. At the police station, Jayden confronts Azalea once again who reveals herself to be Abigail Williams, the ringleader of the Salem Witch Trials. Azalea, heartbroken and betrayed by her lover Reverend Parrish reveals to Jayden she will kill him and destroy the company unless Jayden resigns and gets Mitch to hire her. Jayden ultimately refuses and he, along with Leah and Cheyenne rush back to the office to destroy the talisman once and for good. The three, along with Rich, attempt to burn the talisman in a makeshift bonfire, but are unsuccessful. The four are eventually attacked by a swarm of ravens and slowly make their way to the bottom as the birds begin destroying the skyscraper. In the lobby, Jayden and friends find Azalea, (shockingly) where she reveals to them the lengths she will go to get where she wants to be, at the top of the previable corporate pyramid. Jayden, furious, attacks Azalea and the two engage in a fight as Rich, Leah and Cheyenne escape the collapsing building. When it seems that Azalea has the upper hand, she is eventually defeated by a part-time receptionist Claude from France with a rather large ceramic vase. Jayden and Claude soon escape the building where Jayden (along with Leah) find the ruins of the talisman, much to their relief. Days later, at a very well-known studio in Orlando, Azalea introduces herself as Iris to a Mr. Alan Bergman and, determined to land the job, decides to make it an easy decision for him.

1gxoq3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1gxoq3r/we_need_to_talk_about_pipes/,We need to talk about pipes,"Coffee Stain,

I want to start out by saying I absolutely LOVE your game. I'm a new gen player who just got the game after the 1.0 release, and I've dumped a few hundred hours in so far. I've been playing games a long time, and this is easily one of the best designed games I've ever seen. With that out of the way, please please please please please fix pipes. Pipes in their current state are insanely frustrating to work with.

The sloshing mechanic has to go. Whatever you need to do in order to get rid of this horrible mechanic, please do it. It's unintuitive, annoying to work around, and not explained anywhere in game that I could find. Maybe mark 3 pipes could be directional?

There's absolutely no way to make mk2 pipes run at 100% efficiency, especially when it comes to factories in a manifold orientation. Why? If the pipe says 600m3 per minute then that's what it should be, yet it always falls about 2-3% short of that. I don't understand if that's a bug or something related to sloshing, but it has no place in a game so heavily based on precision and efficiency.

Pipe floor holes are STILL broken. I guarantee this is a known bug because I've found posts about it from 3 years ago. Not a huge deal, since there are some pretty simple work arounds, but come on, this should be fixed by now. I've wasted several hours debugging larger factories due to not knowing about this bug.

I want to reiterate that this post comes from a place of love. I WANT to play more of your game, and I've been having a phenomenal time with it so far. However, these issues have seriously turned me off from partaking in some larger projects, as I know it's essentially impossible for my builds to work the way I want them to. Please fix.

A dedicated player",0,1732327248.0,SatisfactoryGame,0,0.3,False

I had a random number text me tonight saying they’d be in my area (actually named the city I’m from) asking if we’d like to meet for coffee next week. I don’t ever get any spam texts so I asked who it was.. To which they responded their alleged name  and “don’t you have my number saved?” I told them they had the wrong number and figured the conversation would stop there but it didn’t.. They responded back “I just changed my mobile phone, but it saved your name and region, and I was wondering if we know each other.” I asked who they thought my number belonged to, to see if they knew my name and they didn’t. And then I proceeded again, to tell them they had the wrong number. They expressed apologies again, and still offered to buy me a drink “when they had the chance”. I’ve blocked it now.. But still feeling a little creeped out. The area code the number texted from was an area code registered to California which is on the other side of the country from me.

I already deal with severe dry mouth and have to bring mouth gel, gum, and water with me everywhere. Everytime I get dehydrated I get UTI symptoms - mostly just really painful to pee, some frequency issues and nonstop pain. I've gone to my PCP and tested negative for UTIs. 

Today I was really hydrated but then moved some furniture at work for a big event. Well, I guess I got sort of dehydrated and now I'm miserable. I've got a heating pad between my legs that is giving me some comfort but not much. Azo helps too but takes a while to kick in. 

Can anyone help me on what this can be? It's debilitating and happens to me at least 2 times a week, and on top of my other lupus symptoms I'm really falling apart mentally from the pain. 

Are there creams that help? Is it from inflammation from the dehydration? I didn't drink coffee today so it's not coffee which I thought it could be. Could it be another disease that happens with sjogrens? Any help is greatly appreciated. ❤️",3,1732327156.0,Sjogrens,1,1.0,False

    But hey, I'm not ashamed to say I love you even if you smeared my name, paint me black, gave me shame, and took and hid our daughter
    
    
    I love you-- and I know for sure I'll hold this in my core with warmth as we separate
    I love how you are such a great mother, a radiance you emanate
    I remember when you pranked me that you were pregnant, I didn't know how to react its the first time I felt the world pause and take a break, it sinked in too late
    oh all those annoyance you've had how i'd love to assure you, hug you tight, sit by your side and massage any part that aches...I'd be there when you'd call, and I wouldn't ever ever say ""wait""
    See, I it's my first time, I was figuring things out while pressured for the upcoming date
    But if I could just redo everything, I'd lay in bed with you and listen to everything you'd say...
    I love how you get so happy when you see me hiding behind the pillow from a horror movie, scared shitless and afraid
    I love how cute you are when you try something for the first time, and proudly show it off with grace
    I love you & i love the way you are, your being, I remember asking for you to never change
    I had hoped you listen to black coffee, you'd see how much I see you and appreciate...
    You see, I had a lot of relationships before, and all of them threw me away-
    I know how it is and how we men function, so I acknowledge my previous exes would be snatched up one day-
    
    I was never really chosen, I was the convenience that the boredom would stray
    and words such as ""tell me whenever you don't love me anymore, I'll understand and will be happy for you"" were things I'd used to say
    I've never forced, I never caged, I love freely, its wu-wei....
    Until there you came, the universe finally gave me what I so desperately asked in prayers
    Someone to call my own, yet I do now own you-- you chose me... someone who'll stay...
    Finally someone who has found me, someone who has seen me, that's why I gave and I gave
    For the first time ever, I felt I was understood by someone, and how heavenly did it taste
    I was so grateful that I swore in our tenants, you'd never experience hardships as long as I walk in this plane

    Oh how tremendously I wish we seeked help the first time it came... I am so sorry for the hurtful & painful things I've said
    Oh how tremendously I wish we've both changed... I wanted to be your ally, someone you could rely on, your 100%, your certainty, I wanted to be inside you so much than locked outside the gate..

    Yet the world wasn't all happy, good, filled with sunshine, and bright-- it's also filled with dismay
    How stupid I was to forget a simple fact in a rush you see you smile and bloom like the sunflower & stargazers you faved...
    I remember whispering to your being, I am just happy we're together.. you don't need to change..
    I'm sorry I couldn't handle your episodes, I wish I was more equipped to deal with the pain...
    I remember the feeling oh so vividly... There was not a place I'd rather be than next to you, I enjoyed basking in your presence and you in mine as we kiss and hug each other in a lazy afternoon daze...

    I'd do it all, I'd dabble in the forbidden arts, and move inanimate objects as I imbue them with feeling of love from the very fountain of my being I've attained...
    My love.. I love you Sarah... I guess however bad we were for each other, I'd still say you're the one that got away..
    You are the thought & ideal I would always want and choose... the words of regretting our meeting orchestrated by fate, regretting the marriage and vows we etched in the fabrics of space, I'd contradict with 100% certainty and if God ever gave me the chance to do things again, I would walk into this thing called ""us"" without hesitation and disdain..
    
    Well... maybe I'd brush my teeth before the time we ever got to the square, the jogging area where I confessed to you how I see you shine and give you a better ornament that would help me portray
    How I see you as gold, ever sought and ever wanted, I see you as gold-- not a trophy nor accessory, but my partner in this life and in sky's harmonic display..
    You say I craft words so easy... My secret is I don't filter what my heart speaks, I let it beat as drumming chants for your name... It comes easy to me, remember when I told you however uncertain the world is I know for sure you are the only certainty my sweet Sarah Jane.
    I am sorry for my flaws and for the lack of presence my love.. I hope you can forgive me one day...
    
    You may dispute my words and make your claims, I stay true to my very essence and core.. It's the still the same as we had once said in the document Chessy foundation where we forged our future and name...
    I don't mean to make this dramatic, but there is no other way to really say... I love you and I hope we didn't burn each other, my twin flame..
    Though every fiber of my being screams for your name and wants to be with you... we're too much of a match that a spark can ignite us and we're no phoenix to rise again.

After getting lots of messages on Reddit and social media wondering when we are finally going to open, we have some news. 

Our opening day is scheduled for Sunday, December 1, 2024! At 139 Bank Street. We are hoping there are no roadblocks but will update everyone if anything comes up. 

We have been working non stop for the past 75 days with the renovations team, food suppliers, and other partners to bring this idea to life. 

I would love to hear from you here on this thread or via DM if you have an idea OR if you want to partner up as a host for your own event. Or just to let us know how you might use this cafe personally. 

Community will be absolutely key in making this experiment a success. 

For hours, we are planning to be open from 7 AM (potentially earlier) until 8 PM. We will be reviewing these hours in detail after we open to ensure it meets the needs of our staff and the community.

For coffee, we will be working with Brown Bag Coffee Roasters, through them, we follow our mission of supporting local. We are hopeful that this will be an excellent partnership.

Our espresso machine will be the gorgeous Victoria Arduino Eagle One. If you want a list of our espresso/coffee equipment, let me know in the comments and I’ll paste the links. 

For food, we will be partnering with Olga’s Deli to supply fresh breakfast and lunch items. They are extremely hard working, have been around for decades serving the Ottawa region, and have given me nothing but wonderful service. 

For pastries and other baked goods, we are still finalizing, but we have some great options on the table from Strawberry Blonde to Voila Bakeree

I will make one more post the day before we open just to give everyone a heads up. Your support and feedback will mean everything! 

Thanks and please DM or comment any questions/concerns/feedback.

PS- We are STILL hiring more baristas. Please feel free to DM me or message us on IG to send your CV.",70,1732326959.0,ottawa,42,0.96,False

I find it pretty difficult to describe myself to people, so with old memories and a desire for new ones, I'll write some stuff that might reflect who I am.

I'd finding time in between plans to head to a park to have a quiet, but intimate walk. I would brace for the cold and take off my gloves if it means giving them to you, since you forgot to bring some. During a coffee date, I might reach across the table so I can hold your hand(s). Even with a high fever, I don't mind making you a grilled cheese. I enjoy it, just make sure you dance with me while I'm doing it. I'll book a table at a really nice, local restaurant, let them know it's our first NYE together and I'd like our time there to be cozy and intimate (all secretly and months in advance, of course). I'm visiting and I know I've just gotten to your town, but when you ask me what I wanna do, I'd like to head out to the river so we can dip our feet. It's beautiful in the summer and the sun looks incredible draped across you. We're spending our first Christmas together in our little apartment and I'm tearing up because we've just finished decorating our first tree. Yeah, neither of us are particularly religious, but you can't beat those classic Winter aesthetics, right? Your smiles says it all. I hear you softly whispering your favorite holiday songs, it's one of my favorite things. I slip my arms around you from behind, you smell soft and warm. The world sounds quiet, in the way it always does when it's been snowing. No one else seems to exist, but it's not lonely. I have you.

When I was younger, much like anyone else, I idealized what my special someone could be like. Yet over time I realized the joy that exists in the surprise of discovery, the little intricacies of how similar or different we are and how beautiful it is to have our own things. I like having spicy mayo on my sandwiches, but you think mayo is icky. That's cool. I'm not fond of root beer, but you can't even keep 'em stocked in your fridge long enough. I've come to accept that corn pizza isn't as bad as you'd think but you're calling me a heathen. That's okay, it's funny and you also don't need to eat it (smiling as I write this). There's also moments that stuff turns a little serious, where rather unintentionally I might say something that reminds you of your past hurt. I didn't know and I didn't mean it that way, so please clue me in, I'd never want to make that mistake again. Maybe the same would happen on your side, you mention something regarding wearing the same clothes too often. It kind of hurts. You had no idea I had hangups about that, but it's okay, I explain it goes back to a childhood schoolyard thing. You promise to remember and I trust you. How could I not? It's you.

Forever is a really long time. Not everyone can do forever. Forever is easy to agree to, forever is vast and incomprehensible. Forever must be faced with nothing less than a resounding yes. Forever needs to mean everything and nothing at the same time. Forever needs to be genuine, honest, and true. Forever has steps to take before it is faced, steps that cannot be skipped. Forever needs to be a discussion and from my side, the choice has always been yes, so long as the other half of it is just as ready to face the unknown and unexpected of what forever brings. But forever is equally beautiful as it is expansive, much like the depths of the universe we live in. But forever sounds joyful to me, like rolling hills and an endless field of flowers, so long as you're there.

Even from my younger years, I knew relationships are no walk in the park. Of course I didn't know what that really entailed and how could I ever know? Youth is plucky. Anyway, relationships are powered by patience, trust, and courage. You wake up and go to bed every day, always choosing your partner. Sometimes you wake up, the day's already ruined, but you choose them nonetheless. It's been a whole shift and overtime, but you choose them. There's a misunderstanding, feelings are hurt, an argument breaks out over who is right or wrong. You take a moment and remember that right or wrong might not even matter, you shake it off and you choose them and you listen. Over and over, you choose them. If a time comes when either side doesn't want to choose the other, you set it all down and be honest and respectful. You talk it through, you check to see if the fundamentals of the relationship are fuzzy or if you've skipped some steps. You remember why you're together. You remember that it's both give and take from both sides. You find the common ground and you keep your heart open and your mind sharp. We choose each other.

1gxom64,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gxom64/aitah_for_thinking_my_roommate_is_bringing_her/,AITAH for thinking my roommate is bringing her new bf over increasingly too often?,"I (30F) live in a share house with 2 roommates (24M & 28F). Let’s call the girl roommate Leah. 

Leah moved in a bit over 6 months ago, and was single. She is social and has a small group of friends she brings over to watch movies, party, play board games with about once or twice a fortnight. She recently got a new boyfriend. 

He started coming over more — they’d spoon on the couch, sprawl out their Uber eats orders all over the floor and coffee table, and watch movies at high volume. They did this about once a week, turned into twice a week, now they’re doing this sometimes three times a week. Generally, when he’s here they take over the living room and TV. 

It is often I come home from a long hard day of work, to find them spooning on the couch doing this routine. I’m immediately relegated to my room and so is my other roommate. If I sit in the living room with them even just to eat dinner, they keep trying to make conversation with me, even when I’m clearly just tryna chill or tired from work (I’m a lawyer, I talk and write all day late hours, when I come home I don’t want to have idle small talk with my roommate or her bf). It’s agitating, and they watch shitty stuff. I’m fine with them doing this once a week. But 2-3 times is too much. Can’t they just do it in her room?

They did it last night. This morning I got back from the gym and was sitting on the couch on my laptop, so when they came down they spooned on the bean bag. I closed my laptop and went to the kitchen to whip up a snack, and when I came back to the living room, they moved to the couch and were spooning there so I had to sit on the beanbag or go upstairs! 

It’s driving me crazy and I’m bout to lose my shit. I need advice. AITAH?",3,1732326912.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1gxokwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1gxokwz/does_this_sound_like_a_healthy_way_to_lose_weight/,Does this sound like a healthy way to lose weight & be healthy?,"I know that other people may have asked this before, but I do want to know if there’s anything I maybe am not thinking of and if this sounds long-term sustainable! 
Context: I have a pretty active lifestyle and I work in the service industry (food industry) and am running around and on my feet 5 days/wk for 6-8 hours depending on the shift. I go on lots of outdoor walks, walk around the neighborhood a lot, etc. I in the past haven’t ever really gone to the gym, but occasionally would do yoga at home. I also in the past have eaten probably too much as a whole and too much sugar and processed food, as I off and on deal with a lot of job/life burnout & stress , and often really haven’t had energy to fuel my body right (I also deal w/ a lot of food aversions and texture issues I have to train myself to get over). 

However, with this context for a while I’ve been suspecting I’m either pre-diabetic or already there, potentially have PCOS. I’ve always dealt with hormonal issues my whole life (I’m f25) and my most recent blood results from when I had appendicitis show seriously elevated resting blood sugar levels (125). 

I have decided to finally get healthy - and so far it’s been about a week and a half. I cut out caffeine from coffee (basically cut coffee as a whole), only drink tea and sometimes matcha and water. I’ve been trying to figure out the best diet - low GI foods and adding in things that help with regulating blood sugar (raspberries and just lots of veggies). Trying to get more fiber, trying to still eat protein. I’ve also heard seafood can be good - so I mostly eat salmon, sometimes my partner cooks steak that we split, pork, salads, edamame, apples, smoothies with yogurt/berries/flax seeds & chia seeds, miso soup, seaweed, lots and lots of zucchini (one veggie I super enjoy). 

I’ve also started going to the gym - trying to go at least 3 times/week. I tried to start running about a month ago, but did too much too fast so waiting for my knee to get to 100% not swollen anymore has meant low-impact workouts - elliptical, Pilates, or just regular old walking on the treadmill. 

Back on the topic of food - I am eating at a deficit, I’m 5’ probably around 160lbs right now - with my goal being between 110-120lbs or at least just healthier as a whole but really that’s my weight goal. I’m eating around 1,100-1,400 calories per day, (I calculated per my average activity per day and that’s what the calculator estimated I should be at!). 

Is this enough? Is there other things I could think about / do? Are there other things I should consider/think about? I’m pretty new to trying to be healthy the right & sustainable way and also to exercising (anything other than hiking and yoga) and especially the gym! 

(It’s starting to get cold outside so my general activity level is starting to go down as it’s a little harder to be outside 24/7, but I’m trying to still do my best!)

Creatista is really pricey but I like the wand feature to froth milk and the design is amazing. However, seems that it doesn't work for cold beverages. 
Does it really worth the price?

On the other hand, would I obtain a similar milk/coffee result with an Essenza + Aeroccino? I'm thinking about the Aeroccino 4 which works for cold beverages.

Considering that I'm a milk + coffee person (I hate black coffee), what would be the best option?

I know now you didn't see me, it's smoke & mirrors, a trauma

I thought you could see it too... the magic behind our ether...

But hey, I'm not ashamed to say I love you even if you smeared my name, paint me black, gave me shame, and took and hid our daughter

I love you-- and I know for sure I'll hold this in my core with warmth as we separate

I love how you are such a great mother, a radiance you emanate

I remember when you pranked me that you were pregnant, I didn't know how to react its the first time I felt the world pause and take a break, it sinked in too late

oh all those annoyance you've had how i'd love to assure you, hug you tight, sit by your side and massage any part that aches...

I'd be there when you'd call, and I wouldn't ever ever say ""wait""

See, I it's my first time, I was figuring things out while pressured for the upcoming date

But if I could just redo everything, I'd lay in bed with you and listen to everything you'd say...

I love how you get so happy when you see me hiding behind the pillow from a horror movie, scared shitless and afraid

I love how cute you are when you try something for the first time, and proudly show it off with grace

I love you & i love the way you are, your being, I remember asking for you to never change

I had hoped you listen to black coffee, you'd see how much I see you and appreciate...

You see, I had a lot of relationships before, and all of them threw me away-

I know how it is and how we men function, so I acknowledge my previous exes would be snatched up one day-

I was never really chosen, I was the convenience that the boredom would stray

and words such as ""tell me whenever you don't love me anymore, I'll understand and will be happy for you"" were things I'd used to say

I've never forced, I never caged, I love freely, its wu-wei....

Until there you came, the universe finally gave me what I so desperately asked in prayers

Someone to call my own, yet I do now own you-- you chose me... someone who'll stay...

Finally someone who has found me, someone who has seen me, that's why I gave and I gave

For the first time ever, I felt I was understood by someone, and how heavenly did it taste

I was so grateful that I swore in our tenants, you'd never experience hardships as long as I walk in this plane

I had so much love to give, my chest is full to this day

That's why I ask my brain, Oh how much I hurt myself and blame...

""what have I done wrong"", I asked -- oh my love, how I wanted to grow with you into old age...

It's only you, only ever you -- even if the facts of who we are would be against...

I had hoped, we'd be a fit... I wish we'd still be a family, just like how the painting was portrayed...

My love, I've given you my essence, yet I'd still bet on you like a gambler that's only left with spare change..

I am sorry for all we've been and all that happened, the trauma and pain

the man should have led the unit & family into God, Glory, Success, and Faith.

Oh how tremendously I have failed... I am so sorry for everything I have done to protect myself from the chill you'd emanate..

Oh how tremendously I wish we seeked help the first time it came... I am so sorry for the hurtful & painful things I've said

Oh how tremendously I wish we've both changed... I wanted to be your ally, someone you could rely on, your 100%, your certainty, I wanted to be inside you so much than locked outside the gate..

Oh I would serve you, as my purpose is clear from the very first day..

I loved telling my friends ""hey guys my wife is calling, Im going home"" I wanted you respected and graced

You called me in Thailand, said your best friend wasn't coming to our marriage that day..

It tore me up, I was forlorn, how I would book a flight to comfort you, yet I'm just a man and time isn't something I can sway..

Instead, I'd involve you include you, keep you up to date, introduce you and crown you, I whispered to myself you'd never be alone ever again and you'd never be lonely I'd give you the whole world in every meaning it can be defined however it may...

Yet the world wasn't all happy, good, filled with sunshine, and bright-- it's also filled with dismay

How stupid I was to forget a simple fact in a rush you see you smile and bloom like the sunflower & stargazers you faved...

I remember whispering to your being, I am just happy we're together.. you don't need to change..

I'm sorry I couldn't handle your episodes, I wish I was more equipped to deal with the pain...

I remember the feeling oh so vividly... There was not a place I'd rather be than next to you, I enjoyed basking in your presence and you in mine as we kiss and hug each other in a lazy afternoon daze...

There is so so so much I wanted to say... I'd make alchemy, breathe life into objects and appliances to keep you entertained..

I'd do it all, I'd dabble in the forbidden arts, and move inanimate objects as I imbue them with feeling of love from the very fountain of my being I've attained...

My love.. I love you Sarah... I guess however bad we were for each other, I'd still say you're the one that got away..

You are the thought & ideal I would always want and choose... the words of regretting our meeting orchestrated by fate, regretting the marriage and vows we etched in the fabrics of space, I'd contradict with 100% certainty and if God ever gave me the chance to do things again, I would walk into this thing called ""us"" without hesitation and disdain..

Well... maybe I'd brush my teeth before the time we ever got to the square, the jogging area where I confessed to you how I see you shine and give you a better ornament that would help me portray

How I see you as gold, ever sought and ever wanted, I see you as gold-- not a trophy nor accessory, but my partner in this life and in sky's harmonic display..

You say I craft words so easy... My secret is I don't filter what my heart speaks, I let it beat as drumming chants for your name... It comes easy to me, remember when I told you however uncertain the world is I know for sure you are the only certainty my sweet Sarah Jane.

I am sorry for my flaws and for the lack of presence my love.. I hope you can forgive me one day...

You may dispute my words and make your claims, I stay true to my very essence and core.. It's the still the same as we had once said in the document Chessy foundation where we forged our future and name...

I don't mean to make this dramatic, but there is no other way to really say... I love you and I hope we didn't burn each other, my twin flame..

Though every fiber of my being screams for your name and wants to be with you... we're too much of a match that a spark can ignite us and we're no phoenix to rise again.

I love you. Farewell.. With love, I proclaim.

I love you...

I’d really like to install a push button switch on the base that could independently control which bulb was lit.  So press - bulb one on; press - bulb two on; press - both bulbs on.

1gxodbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysautonomia/comments/1gxodbx/vasovagal_syncope_bradycardia_and_heart_stopping/,"Vasovagal Syncope, Bradycardia, and Heart Stopping","I'm hoping someone here has had a similar set of circumstances or potentially can help me out.  Not quite sure how to do this so will start with listing some of my symptoms in the order of how frustrating they are for me.

**Fatigue** \- Ever since I was a kid I've been on the tired and lethargic side, with those symptoms getting exponentially worse as I've gotten older.  In my teenage years I self medicated with coffee but as with all caffeine I needed more and more to get by.  I would quit for a few months, feel like an absolute zombie, then drink it again and get numerous compliments from those around me on my 'newfound energy'.  This has worsened in adulthood, but now with the need to work I feel trapped in the caffeine cycle.  This is truly the most frustrating part for me as I just don't feel.. alive.. most of the time, the fatigue is unreal.

**Passing Out** \- I've passed out roughly a dozen times in my life, as early as six when I had an upset stomach and as recently as this year due to a tilt table test.  Each time it fully takes my day out and I to spend the rest of the day recovering.  The reasons vary; feeling sick, dehydration, stress, and intense cardio (in that order) seem to be the prominent reasons.  With the tilt table test I learned that my heart stops when I pass out.  The Dr. told me it stopped for 28 seconds.   

**Shakiness** \- I also pretty routinely get shaky.  This seems to happen if I haven't had just enough water/food with enough time in the day to properly digest them.  Additionally my heart seems to have a goldilocks thing going on where if it's beating too fast suddenly then I also will feel shaky.  This has prevented me from doing higher intensity cardio as I'm scared to pass out.

**Other** \- I also get light headed and dizzy pretty often.  When I pass out I am very disoriented for the day.  I am constantly thirsty and maybe unrelated or maybe not but I seem to have IBS-like symptoms.  These have lead to passing out before.

**Bradycardia** \- I'm assuming this is related, albeit there's a chance it's not.  Since I remember my resting heart rate being measured it's been low.  Usually in the 43-47 range.  I am not a runner and never have been.  With the loop recorder I've learned my sleeping heart rate is in the 30s.  Additionally, the loop recorder has noted multiple 1-4 second pauses while sleeping nearly every night.  

\----

What has been done thus far treatment wise:

* EKG (came back normal)
* Blood tests (normal)
* Diabetes (negative)
* Tilt Table Test (Vasovagal Syncope, not POTS)
* Sleep Study (mild sleep apnea)
* Medicine (Theophylline) - this seems to help a little and increases my heart rate to \~48 on average
* Pacemaker - this has been discussed but they are hesitant to give me one as I'm young.

\----

I know that was an essay so if anyone's still reading, thank you!!  I may have rambled a bit but I am concerned as my doctors seem more concerned with treating symptoms where I'm wondering if there's potentially any root cause.  If anyone has gone on a similar journey I'd love to learn from you.  Additionally, I feel I need a pacemaker and am beginning to wonder if I should be getting a second opinion.",2,1732326169.0,dysautonomia,1,1.0,False
1gxocmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoetryWritingClub/comments/1gxocmk/satcitananda_sachi_danand/,Satcitananda ( Sachi--- danand),"I know now you didn't love me, you loved an idea.

I know now you didn't see me, it's smoke & mirrors, a trauma

I thought you could see it too... the magic behind our ether...

But hey, I'm not ashamed to say I love you even if you smeared my name, paint me black, gave me shame, and took and hid our daughter

I love you-- and I know for sure I'll hold this in my core with warmth as we separate

I love how you are such a great mother, a radiance you emanate

I remember when you pranked me that you were pregnant, I didn't know how to react its the first time I felt the world pause and take a break, it sinked in too late

oh all those annoyance you've had how i'd love to assure you, hug you tight, sit by your side and massage any part that aches...

I'd be there when you'd call, and I wouldn't ever ever say ""wait""

See, I it's my first time, I was figuring things out while pressured for the upcoming date

But if I could just redo everything, I'd lay in bed with you and listen to everything you'd say...

I love how you get so happy when you see me hiding behind the pillow from a horror movie, scared shitless and afraid

I love how cute you are when you try something for the first time, and proudly show it off with grace

I love you & i love the way you are, your being, I remember asking for you to never change

I had hoped you listen to black coffee, you'd see how much I see you and appreciate...

You see, I had a lot of relationships before, and all of them threw me away-

I know how it is and how we men function, so I acknowledge my previous exes would be snatched up one day-

I was never really chosen, I was the convenience that the boredom would stray

and words such as ""tell me whenever you don't love me anymore, I'll understand and will be happy for you"" were things I'd used to say

I've never forced, I never caged, I love freely, its wu-wei....

Until there you came, the universe finally gave me what I so desperately asked in prayers

Someone to call my own, yet I do now own you-- you chose me... someone who'll stay...

Finally someone who has found me, someone who has seen me, that's why I gave and I gave

For the first time ever, I felt I was understood by someone, and how heavenly did it taste

I was so grateful that I swore in our tenants, you'd never experience hardships as long as I walk in this plane

I had so much love to give, my chest is full to this day

That's why I ask my brain, Oh how much I hurt myself and blame...

""what have I done wrong"", I asked -- oh my love, how I wanted to grow with you into old age...

It's only you, only ever you -- even if the facts of who we are would be against...

I had hoped, we'd be a fit... I wish we'd still be a family, just like how the painting was portrayed...

My love, I've given you my essence, yet I'd still bet on you like a gambler that's only left with spare change..

I am sorry for all we've been and all that happened, the trauma and pain

the man should have led the unit & family into God, Glory, Success, and Faith.

Oh how tremendously I have failed... I am so sorry for everything I have done to protect myself from the chill you'd emanate..

Oh how tremendously I wish we seeked help the first time it came... I am so sorry for the hurtful & painful things I've said

Oh how tremendously I wish we've both changed... I wanted to be your ally, someone you could rely on, your 100%, your certainty, I wanted to be inside you so much than locked outside the gate..

Oh I would serve you, as my purpose is clear from the very first day..

I loved telling my friends ""hey guys my wife is calling, Im going home"" I wanted you respected and graced

You called me in Thailand, said your best friend wasn't coming to our marriage that day..

It tore me up, I was forlorn, how I would book a flight to comfort you, yet I'm just a man and time isn't something I can sway..

Instead, I'd involve you include you, keep you up to date, introduce you and crown you, I whispered to myself you'd never be alone ever again and you'd never be lonely I'd give you the whole world in every meaning it can be defined however it may...

Yet the world wasn't all happy, good, filled with sunshine, and bright-- it's also filled with dismay

How stupid I was to forget a simple fact in a rush you see you smile and bloom like the sunflower & stargazers you faved...

I remember whispering to your being, I am just happy we're together.. you don't need to change..

I'm sorry I couldn't handle your episodes, I wish I was more equipped to deal with the pain...

I remember the feeling oh so vividly... There was not a place I'd rather be than next to you, I enjoyed basking in your presence and you in mine as we kiss and hug each other in a lazy afternoon daze...

There is so so so much I wanted to say... I'd make alchemy, breathe life into objects and appliances to keep you entertained..

I'd do it all, I'd dabble in the forbidden arts, and move inanimate objects as I imbue them with feeling of love from the very fountain of my being I've attained...

My love.. I love you Sarah... I guess however bad we were for each other, I'd still say you're the one that got away..

You are the thought & ideal I would always want and choose... the words of regretting our meeting orchestrated by fate, regretting the marriage and vows we etched in the fabrics of space, I'd contradict with 100% certainty and if God ever gave me the chance to do things again, I would walk into this thing called ""us"" without hesitation and disdain..

Well... maybe I'd brush my teeth before the time we ever got to the square, the jogging area where I confessed to you how I see you shine and give you a better ornament that would help me portray

How I see you as gold, ever sought and ever wanted, I see you as gold-- not a trophy nor accessory, but my partner in this life and in sky's harmonic display..

You say I craft words so easy... My secret is I don't filter what my heart speaks, I let it beat as drumming chants for your name... It comes easy to me, remember when I told you however uncertain the world is I know for sure you are the only certainty my sweet Sarah Jane.

I am sorry for my flaws and for the lack of presence my love.. I hope you can forgive me one day...

You may dispute my words and make your claims, I stay true to my very essence and core.. It's the still the same as we had once said in the document Chessy foundation where we forged our future and name...

I don't mean to make this dramatic, but there is no other way to really say... I love you and I hope we didn't burn each other, my twin flame..

Though every fiber of my being screams for your name and wants to be with you... we're too much of a match that a spark can ignite us and we're no phoenix to rise again.

I love you. Farewell.. With love, I proclaim.

I love you...

I’m a bit of a hopeless romantic and still kinda believe there is someone out there for me.

I’ve done the online dating apps and it’s not really for me. Browsing profiles and swiping left or right is a weird experience for me.

A little about me; 

My interest, creative writing, music, video games (don’t have much time as I used to for it ), going for walks/hikes/drives, beach combing, art and small art projects. Mental and physical well being. 

I work overnights, I’m up when people are asleep and asleep when people are normally up, probably another reason why I am choosing Reddit to look for romantic interest.

I stand 6’0, weigh about 195lbs, average body. Dark brown eyes, shaved head, beard that’s a mixture of black and grey.

1gxo2b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1gxo2b1/dannam_enchanting_vietnam_review/,D’Annam Enchanting Vietnam Review,"I was slow to get this because there was a mixed combination of notes I love and notes I avoid, but I wanted to try the rice sample so badly!

* **White Rice** \- I couldn’t have been more excited about this! My hope was for a starchy, woody, pandan rice. My fear was that the drydown would have too much white musk laundry scent. This is a true experience. The first few seconds are a sophisticated woody jasmine and then the rice comes in strong and clear. It's everything that was promised: a mountain of starchy, toasty uncooked rice. But the downsides are also as promised: the rice notes have barely any projection or sillage after the first few minutes. I could still smell the rice in the drydown, but only if I pressed my nose to my arm. For a while, I got tonka sillage which isn't my favorite. There's a little white musk in the dry down but not enough to turn me off.

Comparison: Chokedee (Strangers) - also a pandan jasmine rice, sweeter and a little artificial, linear with more projection. Chokedee is not subtle and sophisticated, it's a gooey rice pudding from a busy homestyle Thai restaurant.

Verdict: Split Scent has a 5 ml decant for $20 and that feels like the right amount for now. I’m not on that fleeting experience budget right now.

* **Monsoon Tea** \- I am always down for trying a tea scent. I'm getting more barley tea than green tea. The tea notes have good sillage for several hours and eventually dry down to a warm, grainy, woody skin scent. So far, the strength of these frags is in accurate recreations, this is a lovely and unmistakable tea. I didn't get much from the lime and bergamot, but from other reviews I seem to be in the minority on this so YMMV. Both top notes and drydown are pleasant but a little one-dimensional and boring.

Comparisons: Elephant (Zoologist) - complex tea with green leaves, magnolia, cacao, and animalic musk. This is one of my favorites and I don't feel a need for another tea that doesn't add something new. Lost Alice (Masque Milano) - sweet carrot-peppercorn lactonic black tea. See, this is something different to do with tea.

Verdict: It’s a lovely scent but it doesn’t fill any gaps in my collection and isn’t interesting enough to add as something new. I’ll happily finish the sample though.

* **In the Garden** \- Although I’m not typically a huge floral fan, the other notes sounded amazing - pear, petitgrain, coconut, and sandalwood. Juicy pear is strong in the first few minutes and continues to add sweetness later, but sandalwood quickly becomes dominant, with soft white floral sillage. Although listed as a top note, the petitgrain shows up more in the drydown. Liking creamy sandalwood is a requirement for this one (I do) and I also enjoyed how the other notes moved in and out over time.

Comparisons: Le Jardin de Monsieur Li (Hermès) - elegant but very heavy on the jasmine. I associate arriving in a cloud of jasmine with feminine self-confidence, but it’s not a good everyday choice for me. In the Garden is smoother, juicier, and woodier. Eau des Merveilles (Hermès) - citrus, peppercorns, amber, and woods. Even though the profile isn’t the same, it fills the same niche for me as tasteful, appropriate for almost anywhere, feminine but not cutesy. Demure. Same with Un Jardin sur la Laguna and Jour d’Hermès.

Verdict: NPC energy (complementary). Perfect everyday spray- and-go option, but sophisticated enough for nicer events.

* **Harvest Season** \- I was intrigued by the rice straw and I like all the other listed notes except patchouli, but it's not always a dominant note so not an instant deal breaker. I couldn’t imagine these notes together before sampling. My overwhelming first impression was “this is ok”. It's inoffensive but doesn't have much personality. I wanted the rice straw to be distinct and unusual, and what I can smell of it is good,  but it's overwhelmed by patchouli, which isn't giving Vietnam. I like the rose more, but also fail to see how that relates to a rice harvest. This is the first sample so far that I think has failed to capture its concept. I wish I could experience this without the patchouli but I'm not sure it would be more coherent. I want to finish wearing this for the day so I can get to the next sample.

Comparison: I don't have anything similar because I avoid strong patchouli. That's also why I gave away my Terre d’Hermès samples.

Verdict: Don't make me say patchouli again.

* **Phu Quoc** \- I like briny aquatics but this is too clean and soapy, like men’s body wash. The green peppercorn is strong and sharp and makes Phu Quoc a little more interesting. The woody base notes are weak. It’s a completely different profile than any of the others so far and I respect that every sample is going for something new, I value this in a discovery set. I get a similar overall feeling as from Harvest Season - it has a note that I dislike but it’s not ruining everything, just not very inspiring. It does give the impression of open air and I think I’d like this more on a real beach than at home.

Comparisons: Walk the Sea (Kerosene) - Briny, musky, ambergris reproduction with tuberose. This is more inline with what I want from an aquatic. Seahorse (Zoologist) - Also an herbal/aromatic bright aquatic, but totally different. Seahorse is a 90s calone aftershave with fennel and probably ambroxan, not blue or soapy at all.

Verdict: I don’t know when or where I’d wear this since I’d never pick this over the salty aquatics I prefer.

* **Da Lat** \- I  wasn’t expecting to like this at all, because I don’t like juniper or red wine. It’s not as bad as I expected. The juniper blends down well into the florals instead of having a lot of projection on its own, and the wine isn’t too boozy, but these are not notes I’d ever choose for myself. The rose is lovely but not my personal style. I like the nagarmotha base. In fact, I think this would be extremely nice for someone else, just not me.

Comparisons: Penguin and Macaque Yuzu (Zoologist): I’m still intrigued by Penguin because of the cold environment concept, but I honestly hate Macaque Yuzu. I avoid wearing either of them because of the juniper note. The juniper in Da Lat is better for me than either, but that’s damning with faint praise. Black Rose and Oud (Salt & Stone): I prefer this as a rose frag. It’s deeper and less juicy.

Verdict: This was as good as I could have possibly wanted from a list of notes I don’t like, but it’s still not me.

Intermission: I wore In the Garden to a work lunch and it was very pleasant, not too meek but not too obtrusive.

* **Pho Breakfast** \- I do kind of want to smell like a bowl of pho? I say I don’t like gourmands, but I really mean that I don’t want to smell like a vanilla cookie. This is what discovery sets are for because this absolutely does smell like pho accouterments. We are back to having experiences and it’s fun. I don’t think I’ve ever encountered basil and cilantro notes before. Unfortunately, I don’t like the drydown because again with the patchouli, but I’m still excited that I got to try this.

Comparisons: Un Jardin a Cythere (Hermès) - If you wanted to smell like pho, perhaps you would also like to smell like Greek salad dressing? Neroli and Basil (Salt & Stone deodorant) - a more soupy basil with eucalyptus. Basil and armpits aren’t the right pairing, and I wouldn’t want pho-scented armpits either. Deodorants and gourmands probably shouldn’t mix.

Verdict: Great and unusual experience but a sample is enough.

* **Through the Forest** \- So far incense has been a one-note dealbreaker for me, but I was willing to try one more from a different house. It wasn't like I could pick and choose with this discovery set, so I was pretending it might be ok, but it’s not. Incense projects insanely well on me, so it’s  unfortunate that I hate it. I can’t really smell any of the other notes, and I do like saffron and oud, but I’m getting just incense and more incense. I need to go try to scrub this off. I hate this.

Comparison: Tiger and Moth (Zoologist) - I sampled these before knowing how much I disliked incense. I’m going to be giving all my incense samples away at r/fragranceswap pretty soon.

Verdict: I have enough experience with samples now that I’m certain I should avoid anything with incense.

* **Vietnamese Coffee** \- I love that this recalls a very specific type of coffee and not generic coffeehouse vibes. I’m glad to be ending with this after scrubbing Through the Forest - it would have been a disappointment if the last sample was something I hated. At first I got a lot of the muguet (lily of the valley), but in no time at all, it became an amber skin scent with coffee projection. I usually like lactonic notes, but I’m actually happy this isn’t more creamy or sweet because it feels more realistic and less like an idealized “cozy” scent. But ultimately I prefer drinking coffee to smelling like coffee.

Comparison: I don’t have any other coffee scents.

Verdict:  I love having this sample but don’t have a need for more.

**Personal ranking**

1. White Rice/In the Garden 
2. Vietnamese Coffee 
3. Monsoon Tea 
4. Da Lat 
5. Pho Breakfast 
6. Harvest Season 
7. Phu Quoc/Through the Forest

I enjoyed the discovery but only liked about half the frags. I suspected this would be the case, which is why I was slow to buy it. I’m happy with the experience, but wasn’t blown away. I sample a lot and I have so many that I do like that I’ve become faster to give away those I dislike. I might be better off with specific samples for notes I’m actively interested in (unless the set is a really great deal like ELDO!)  Rice has been a surprise favorite note this year. And I’ve learned that incense is an instant dealbreaker. Overall, the notes lists were very accurate and if you think they look intriguing, you’ll probably enjoy the journey.",2,1732325237.0,fragrance,1,1.0,False
1gxo1rh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gxo1rh/i_ended_it_when_i_realized_it_was_a_situationship/,I ended it when I realized it was a situationship - now I need to get over him ,"I (24 F) met this guy (30 M) in the gym in August and things have been going well between us for the past three months. We have been going on dates, and I've been spending time with him at his house (cooking dinner together, watching shows and movies on Netflix). We also have sex regularly and see each other about once a week. We spent about every weekend together for the past three weeks. We text every single day and FaceTime a few times a week. There's amazing emotional chemistry between us and I enjoy our conversations and time together a lot. He has expressed the same sentiment. We both have been able to be vulnerable with one another about stuff with our families, mental health, and careers. He frequently compliments by intellect, personality, and physical appearance. In the beginning, we both agreed we weren't looking for anything serious. However, after about two months, I felt like he was applying more pressure. For example:

* He took me out to a nice restaurant for my birthday and brought me flowers 
* When I went to NYC with my friends, he offered to order me Ubers so I didn't have to take the subway
* He's talked to me about getting me some sort of protection for self-defense (e.g., a taser or pocketknife) for when I'm out alone
* He's put air in my tire for me without me asking
* He offered to pay for my car wash 
*  When I went to NYC with my friends, he offered to order me Ubers so I didn't have to take the subway
* He's expressed multiple times how he wants to spend more time with me
* He has cooked me dinner 
* When I had a migraine, he offered to bring me medicine 
* He's always asking me to spend the night, although I never have 
* Once, he asked if I wanted to run errands with him 
* He's giving me massages 
* He's randomly sent me money to get a coffee
* He asked me once about my thoughts on finding ""the one""
* If it has been a while since I texted him back, he would double text me to check on me 

There's so many more examples, but these were the main ones that could come to mind as I'm writing this. To me, these actions were surprising. I'm new to dating, but just felt like these weren't the actions of someone who you are casually dating. It felt more intentional. There were a few weeks in October where I was super busy and could only stop by after work for about an hour/hour and a half. During that time, we'd have sex and I'd leave shortly after. After a few weeks of this, we had a conversation where he expressed that he wanted us to focus less on sex and focus more on building an emotional bond and exploring emotional intimacy. He made it clear that he didn't want a situationship and also didn't want just want sex. We agreed that it was okay to have sex, but he didn't want me stopping by just for that and then leaving.

A week later, we had a check in, and he said he wanted to make sure we were on the same page. He made he clear that I was the only girl he was seeing and having sex with. He said he wanted feelings involved and commitment, but only to a certain extent. At the time, I thought I understood what he was asking, but later I realized I wasn't okay with this. It sounded like a situationship, which is what we both agreed we did not want. I did some reflecting and checked in with myself. I realized that my feelings for him have been growing and that if we kept spending time together at such a high frequency and quality, they would continue to grow. I found myself missing him more when we weren't talking and thinking about him more often. I was also craving more time with him and thinking about the next opportunity for us to spend time together. 

I started to get confused because, although he said he didn't want a relationship, the things he was doing and saying made me feel as if I was being courted. I'm not ready for a relationship right now, but I thought that with him saying he was ""intentional"" about how he spends time with me and him expressing his desire to build a bond and intimacy with me, that perhaps we would be able to work toward being in a relationship when we were both ready. I started to worry that we weren't on the same page and, to avoid getting in too deep and getting my feelings hurt, I decided to cut him off.

On Monday, I explained that I didn't feel we were on the same page and that maybe we should part ways to avoid me getting hurt. He seemed shocked and was asking what could be done differently. He reiterated that he was not looking for anything long term and that he needed to do more work on himself before he committed to someone. I completely understand and I'm in the same boat myself, but I just feel that it's a waste of emotional energy to intentionally build intimacy and a bond with someone just for it to go nowhere. To me, that is a situationship, and that's not what I want. I would hope that doing this with someone would eventually lead to something.

The conversation was very mature and there was no yelling or hostility. He seemed disappointed, but we both agreed to part ways. He asked if the lines of communication would still be open between us if he ever changed his mind in the future. He texted me shortly after apologizing, but I did not respond. Tuesday, I started to have some regrets. I was missing him and was worried maybe I'd self-sabotaged and acted impulsively because I was afraid of getting hurt. I asked him if there was a chance we could recalibrate and we discussed some more. He said I needed to have clarity on what I wanted things to look like between us and that deep down, I knew I wouldn't be fulfilled by what he is able to give me in the moment. He kept saying he did not want me to get hurt and that he tried to be clear with me from the beginning about his intentions so I could manage my feelings and expectations. Looking back, I think I texted him Tuesday and was second guessing my decision because I missed him and missed talking to him, but now I realize I made the right decision the first time. I know I will get over him within the next few weeks, but a part of me is mourning what could have been. 

After our second talk on Tuesday, he sent me an Instagram Reelz about an hour later. I did not respond. He also texted me my name later that night and did not say anything after that. I didn't respond to that either. What did he want? It's been hard to ignore him, but I think he was testing the waters to see if he was blocked or if I would respond. I'm not mad at him, but just need my space to get over him. I just want to know where things went wrong. I feel so stupid because things were going so well. I want to be confident that I made the right decision. Am I wrong/delusional for the way I interpreted his actions? I'm new to dating and need to know what not to do next time so I don't keep ending up in situations like this. I also need to fight the urge to text him back and stop hoping that he will miraculously change his mind. Any thoughts or tips?",3,1732325194.0,dating,2,1.0,False

1gxo0xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1gxo0xt/30flooking_for_friendships_rooted_outside_of/,30F-Looking for friendships rooted outside of trauma bonding,"Look, I know my title might make me seem like an asshole, and admittedly I did become a bit jaded compared to before, but I am also tired of being people's emotional trashcan. While it is an honor that people feel comfortable enough to talk about their traumatic experiences and depression within the first 15 minutes of getting to know each other, it feels very overwhelming, especially afterwards when they feel better and no longer has the need to contact me. I'm burnt out and I no longer want to play the therapist role for someone I barely know. I work in the mental health field so a majority of the time I am trying to find ways to assist with various traumas and I just want to have days where I can laugh and have small talks about silly little things. I am also a full time graduate student, so time is something I have very little of and would like to spend it in a different way. That's not to say I will never lend an ear, but I just can't do it every single day or within the first 10 minutes of meeting someone, for the sake of my own mental health (shout-out to my therapist for helping me learn that setting boundaries is okay). 

Now, that's out of the way, here are some things about myself. I'm a shy, introverted, homebody but usually people's first impression of me is completely the opposite. I'm often told that I'm very bubbly and optimistic and I like to think I'm decent at holding conversations. One of my most googled searches includes ""random questions to ask a stranger"" and ""questions to make you fall in love"" so there's that. I'm an absolute huge fan of dad jokes and you will never be able to get me to shut up about it. Expect something about a sad coffee being a depresso at 3 am and how my recliner and I go way back (I prefer discord to communicate).

1gxnxaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenageengineering/comments/1gxnxaw/thoughts_on_why_te_products_are_overpriced_by/,Thoughts on why TE products are overpriced. By former Product Owner/Manager/Executive-dirtbag,"I keep thinking why the F do they overprice their products???

Then it hit me. Their company/dev team is small. So what does that have to do with pricing? I'll try explain my thinking:

A cheaper price would mean more sales. Meaning higher demand for production. Meaning the small team they have would have to rapidly expand to meet demand. But why expand team? Quality Control. Man you have no idea how much of a shit-fight quality control is in any product and field. The smaller the team, the easier and tighter they can control quality and really dig down into improvements. Given musical equipment is very niche, unlike say Google who do more than just search engine, the revenue and capital is more difficult to secure and maintain. A higher price regulates sales and volume of products sold, maintaining a higher level of quality control over time as they learn. \*their team are human too, they make huge fk ups along the way, but smaller team and less pressure on them enables them to come up with things like OP1, OPZ, OPXY. Any business starting out is hit and miss, you dont know if you will succeed or go completely broke and set back at least 10 years for any future bright ideas.

If i missed anything, probably because the brain is much faster than my fingers typing. Before i even finish typing, brain is thinking ""you need coffee, get up, get in your car, go to the shop and just look at the OP-XY, do it. omg... youre still typing. We finished this thought 5 minutes ago. Cmon. Im bored. Your fingers too slow.""

TLDR:

TE products are overpriced because the price is used as a control over production and quality control. The cheaper the price, the higher the volume, the sooner and quicker quality control slips away and the brand is damaged. The more expensive, the lower the volume, easier to keep track of issues and fix/update with smaller team of TE workers.

Am i pissed off that the new OP-XY costs as much as my kidney? Hell yeah!

1gxnt7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1gxnt7t/my_story_close_to_healing/,"My story, close to healing?","It all started about 7 months ago after a panic attack due to weed. Alarmed, I did some research and immediately got scared, thinking I had ruined my life forever. Today the situation has improved. I have the main disorders of derealization, but I do not identify with those of depersonalization.

The main symptoms I have are: 
- unreal surrounding
- short-term memory problems 
- intrusive thoughts of various kinds 
- existential thoughts 
- deja vu 
- less intense emotions 
- anxiety 
- insomnia 
- hearing difficulties 
- fear of going crazy 
- fear of believing in existential thoughts

The symptoms have changed over time, I feel better than when I couldn't even sleep a wink. Today I also sleep well. I lead a normal life, I study at university, I go out with friends, I dance at the disco, I smoke cigarettes, I drink coffee, I drive a car.
 In everyone's eyes I seem like a normal person, but inside I know that something is still wrong.
Compared to the first few months where I thought that at any moment I would go crazy, subjugated by solipsistic and nihilistic existential thoughts, today I would tell you that I could probably live with this condition for the rest of my life. I wonder if there really is a way to leave everything behind, if I can finally abandon everything that has happened to me, despite my past despite the anxiety, I can finally go back to being normal like before.",1,1732324478.0,dpdr,3,1.0,False

1gxnsu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1gxnsu7/holidays_bad_elderly_care_and_my_ego/,"Holidays, bad elderly care, and my ego","I feel like I don’t even know how to give a full backstory on my situation but the gist is my partner of 8 years comes from a hoarder-level messy house, his grandpa committed suicide when he was a teen and left his family with nothing other than bills. Grandma was the bread winner while his parents made horrible financial and life decisions with the father being alcoholic and the mother a raging narcissist who only cares about her own feelings. She is very focused on food and isn’t good at listening to my SO when he tries to tell her about what’s going on in his life. Seems like all she cares about is garnering attention for herself, her food, and evading any responsibility for how she treats people and talks to people.

As you can imagine, the family enables her by letting it slide when she yells at someone or takes things out on them. There’s an avoidant “forgive and forget” mindset that they’re all used to, but I am not.

Recently, they got into a fight bc my SO refused to rescue her from the side of the road where her scooter died (both parents disabled, one has to stay home with grandma who is now in their care and they treat her badly. It is sad). Keep in mind, he rescued her earlier that morning and it’s his only day off, he’s been trying to work extra lately so we can build our lives. When he refused the second time she pulled the “you’re never there to help us” card, even when it can’t be true bc he’s an only child and they rely on him for physical things they can’t do. This argument spiraled into being more about the general disrespect and apathy they have towards my SO’s life. He blocked them and they came after me. Calling and texting incessantly asking “how is my son” so I lost it, send a long text about how he feels alone in the world bc they don’t seem to care about anything he deals with. The long text covered other things but won’t go into it, but she ignored it! Never responded. Two weeks later she starts sending me recipes, asking me to come over, wishing me a nice day. I didn’t respond at all and had her number notifications turned off to help with my stress. 

Bc of his grandma being sick, he starts talking with them again. Of course they barely apologize for their actions and agree to “move on.” Of course what she doesn’t know is that my partner now recognizes how messed up they are, he feels hurt to have realized that they dont care about how their actions affect his future bc they’re so unprepared, and is being distant just to be able to see grandma. Btw, I don’t even think they are able to give her sufficient care. The house is filthy, and they probably only kept her at home to rock in the caregiver payments bc she was solely paying the bills before she got sick. So that adds to my annoyance bc it’s doesn’t feel right.

Eventually my partner can’t evade the topic any longer, bc she keeps asking if I’m getting her texts or if I’m mad. So I finally respond to one of her annoying texts one day, saying “I was hurt when you didn't acknowledge anything about my long text to you, and then you just texted about food like nothing happened. I feel like I deserve more respect than that. I'm glad you and ___ are talking again, if there's anything important you can always contact your son.” She replied “I didn't mean to offend you but I will just leave it alone cause I have nothing nice to say about your text. Nice to see you standing up to him for a change”

This boiled my blood. During this argument she also tried to distract my SO from the conversation by telling him that I told her that he hits me! And said MY mom was concerned about that too! All lies, which we spoke about together and got on the same page. The tactics she pulls are ridiculous I can’t even cover them all here. 

Few days later she sends “I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt your feelings please forgive me 😭🙏” and it just made me more upset. She doesn’t even know what she’s apologizing for and she doesn’t intend to change! She doesn’t deserve my forgiveness. My SO gently urged me to maybe just respond something bc she keeps bugging him about how I don’t respond, and he claimed that if I just keep not responding it’s hypocritical of me for being mad at how she didn’t respond to my long text. I thought it was dumb but ended up just saying “thanks for your apology” and immediately she invited me to go get groceries and coffee with her. Of course I didn’t respond.

I’m sorry it’s such a long story, but basically I’m trying not to waver right now. My partner feels bad that ‘being with him comes with so many complications’ and it makes me feel weak for not being able to emotionally detach from her behavior. I keep thinking that’s exactly what she’d want. So now, I look like I’m the only one that isn’t ready to ‘move on’ bc I’m having a hard time not being honest about how I feel about their entire life situation. 

If and when we have a kid, we’re worried that it will be a complicated and hurtful dynamic. With holidays coming, I’m planning on going with him bc his family is very very small, but I was going to keep it neutral and just focus on the meal, then split. I plan to evade any conversations with her and leave if it gets disrespectful towards me. It sucks bc I come from a big loving family and we don’t deal with our problems this way, we can just plainly say them.  I don’t think it’s even worth trying to make a point to her, and I already told my partner I’m sticking next to him so she can’t isolate me and try to say manipulative shit when I’m alone like she tends to do.

Sigh. I guess just using this as a sounding board! I know that I don’t need validation from his family, and that it doesn’t matter how I come off. My partner and I are both in therapy and aspire to have a healthy family life of our own. It matters more that I focus on the good in my life, and respect my own feelings, even if it results in me looking bad to them. I wish u all good luck with the holidays, keep your chin up and be strong. ",1,1732324448.0,motherinlawsfromhell,0,1.0,False

I have been dairy free since she was 2 weeks old. I’ve also been exclusively pumping this whole time because in addition to cutting dairy, bottles made her extreme fussiness better. We’ve decided to trial dairy since she is almost 9 months old, and if she can tolerate it, that would give us a lot more options for formula and I could stop pumping! The symptoms of MSPI that she was having initially were mucus in poop, rash, colic. 

I know I didn’t try to introduce dairy the right way (the dairy ladder), but here’s what we did:

Day 1: I had milk in my coffee, cheese on toast,  cooked eggs in butter. Baby had some of a waffle with milk baked in and butter on top

Day 2: milk in my coffee, a baked good with milk in it, sour cream with dinner

Her mood is the same as when we are dairy free (happy!), and no rash has appeared yet. However, she has been pretty gassy and there was some mucus in her poop this evening. Does this mean we failed and need to go back to dairy free? The most bothersome symptom was the screaming—she was extremely uncomfortable and expressed it. Since she’s not fussy, even though there is mucus, can we continue with dairy? This is all just soooo confusing and stressful! 

She did wake up 3 times last night instead of 2, and my all or nothing thinking was saying it’s because of the dairy…but who knows? ",0,1732324336.0,MSPI,3,0.5,False

Maybe another close by island?

I am investigating trips I could do from **Athens Central Railway Station (Larissa Station),**

I believe one is seeing **Evia/Euboea (Chalkida/Chalcis)**? About 1hr 30 mins by train. Seems to be 6 euro each way?

I'm also seeing **Corinth** that is available by train. About 1hr.

I'm investigating a few more but those seem more complex requiring another bus/train connection:

Delphi, Nafplio, Kalavryta

\---

Also if you have any recommendations for things to do within the city or via metro line that would be great too. I believe I've done the ""main"" touristy things In the city but perhaps I've missed some lesser known ones.

I guess I should also visit any of the beaches that are easy to get to by metro. I don't need to go in the water.

Oh, also food recommendations in terms of dishes, I've tried a few things. I guess I need to look for ""greek coffee"", not sure what I ask for or where I find it (I'm not a coffee drinker, but I assume maybe a bakery or any coffee shop lol).

I prefer budget / free things but fine with spending money if needed.

1. The Oppression

Genre: Horror/Thriller 

*Logline: A young boy, desperate for his mother's attention, conjures up an ancient demon with deadly results.*

Synopsis: In 2005, Zane Hayward, feeling ignored by his mother, seeks advice from one of his friends at school to get her attention. He leads Zane to a website able to summon to demons. Zane, hesitant, tries to sit down with his mother, Rochelle, she pushes him aside, in favor of time for herself. Zane, upset (and rightfully so) steals a book from her closet, and with it, creates a Ouija board and summons Baphomet, an ancient demon with a personal grudge against Rochelle. Rochelle soon begins experiencing frightening visions of her childhood, which lead her and her husband Isaac to call in their local pastor and friend Father Donahue for help. During a lesson the three stages of hauntings, Rochelle has another frightening vision, this time of Zane, possessed by Baphomet, in a church, on fire. Rochelle, although hesitant at first, agrees to stay at the parish and while informing Zane, discovers that he stole one of her journals and used it (and the spell online) to create his Ouija board. Rochelle, furious, tears it to shreds, and knowing that he's now in danger, takes him with her, leaving Isaac and the rest of the kids behind. The first night at the sacristy is filled with horrors as Rochelle receives a frightening vision of Baphomet playing dual roles as Father McKinley (Rochelle's deceased exorcist and friend), and her parents who scold her for disobeying and learning about witchcraft. Thankfully, none of it was real but Zane soon has his own terrifying encounter, this time in a dream, where Baphomet introduces himself and tries to make Zane see that he and him are more alike than he realizes. The next day, the family reunites at mass, and while all seems normal at first, things take a dramatic turn where the wine suddenly turns to blood at Zane's fingertips. He convulses, goes into what looks like a seizure and is rushed away to the hospital, where the doctors, can sadly, find nothing wrong with him. He's prescribed valium, and Rochelle, deciding this would be her chance to connect with Zane, and treats the family to a shopping spree at the local mall. There, the family encounters Baphomet again where attacks Seth and warns Zane that he's someone that shouldn't be messed with.

Kiernan, and his friends, thinking they've won, celebrate only for Geraldine to quickly reveal that she was indeed, considering, giving them time off. Kiernan and company, furious, look to Kiernan who decides to go his English teacher, Mr. Jennings for support. After a brief lesson on Anne Frank and the meaning of ""oppression"" Kiernan launches a plan to destroy Geraldine's new store, which he eventually names, ""Blitzkrieg"". Kiernan and his friends, armed with baseball bats and spray paint, infiltrate the mall after hours and quickly lay waste to the 9,000 square foot space. Just as they are all prepared to leave, Geraldine, suddenly shows up, claiming that she ""forgot her wallet"" after having her meltdown at work. Kiernan and company, expecting Geraldine to let them have it, are shocked when Geraldine suddenly reinstates their old salaries and allows the Kiernan, Cody, and Laura to attend the SAT's, largely due to a ""change in the budget."" Kiernan, and his friends overjoyed, give their best to Geraldine and, in the following week, eventually take the SAT's (minus Wyatt and Jill) and pay Geraldine a surprise visit before work where Kiernan gives Geraldine an unexpected surprise.

12. The Night Train

Genre: Horror, Comedy 

*Logline: After firing one too many of his employees, heartless business executive Paul Peterson finds himself being stalked by a sinister train with one destination, hell.*

1gxnnug,https://www.reddit.com/r/pinoy/comments/1gxnnug/we_asked_random_questions_to_a_badjao_street/,We asked random questions to a Badjao street beggar in Cabanatuan.,"I've always been curious about them, so I told my friends we should ask one. We were at Freedom Park, Cabanatuan, where there are beggars, most of them Badjao. Two Badjao girls (ages 6 and 9) approached us, so we asked them random questions in exchange for coins. They agreed.

We asked the eldest, who could speak Tagalog fluently.

Q: Where are you from?
Cabanatuan

Q: Where were you born?
At the terminal (Cabanatuan)

Q: Aren't you from Mindanao?
...

Q: Have you been to Mindanao?
Yes, when we were younger.

Q: Who brought you there?
Mother

Q: Are you siblings?
Yes

Q: Where are your parents?
They're separated. We now live with our grandma.

Q: Where do you sleep?
In our house at Brgy *****

Q: How did you get here?
We ride on the back of jeeps. (Sumasabit sa jeep)

Q: Do you eat at the right time?
Just breakfast and dinner.

Q: What did you eat for breakfast?
Just coffee with rice. Last night, we ate fish.

Q: Do you eat at Jollibee?
No

Q: Don't you go to school?
We go to school. I'm now in Grade 3.
(We asked some simple math questions, and she answered correctly.)

Q: Did you collect much already?
Matumal.

Q: Do you have a boss you give the money to?
No

Q: What do you do with the money, then?
To buy rice and food.

-------------------------------------
She's different from other beggars because she's polite and doesn't annoy you. I was surprised to learn that not all of them are part of a syndicate. I was also shocked to find out they're studying and have a house. I thought they lived on the streets.

That's it! Some of the questions were random, and it was just a quick chat, so we didn't have time to ask more.

Note: This conversation reflects the experiences of the two individuals we spoke to and does not apply to all Badjao or other street beggars.

(I realize that I put the wrong number in the title, I'm sorry)

I'm ready for more trauma.

Free lunch program...

I doubt that was very nourishing for you, Tobias.

Oof his mouse got eaten by a rattlesnake.

>You become a Controller, and it's an ironic name because you have absolutely no control.

See, that's what *I* always thought.

*\*Not me waiting for Tobias to purposefully omit Ax from a situation so I can make my bookly ""Did Jake kick Ax out of the team for knocking him out and disobeying his orders?"" joke\**

>Rachel was bringing McDonald's. Rachel, my own personal cafeteria-lady-in-a-hair-net.

>Don't ever tell her I said that.

Don't worry Tobias, I *never* reveal secrets!

*Oh, by the way, did you know that Rachel was tempted to side with Crayak? :)*

Well, I think it's too late for my bookly joke (see above). Ax just got mentioned.

Uh oh it's meeting time.

>Ax the alien: Elfangor's little brother and, strange as it sounds, my uncle.

Unrelated, but do you ever think that, if Tobias and Ax read these books, they would get offended that they were always introduced as ""Bird-boy"" and ""alien""? I also think that Ax would be offended by always being introduced as ""Elfangor's little brother.""

>Marco: Jake's best friend and Ax's part-time roommate.

Mhm mhm, not gay at all.

Uh oh, the Yeerks are out for blood. Literally.

Damn, they got pissed that they couldn't get red-tailed hawk blood samples at a zoo. Maybe try looking around the local area first?

Uh oh the Yeerks know *~~some of~~* the Animorphs are humans. This is a bit troubling.

>""Are you sure? What about when we all came down with the Andalite flu? The *yamphut*.""

Oh I loved that book.

Oh yeah, we're talking about having blood taken. Um...what's a witty remark...

Don't give your blood to strangers, kids.

That's all I can do.

*Marco and Aximili,*

*sittin' in Ax's scoop,*

*hacking into blood bank computers.*

I'm sorry, that was really bad.

>I found out through a sleazoid lawyer-Controller, of all people.

I find it funny that Tobias says ""lawyer-Controller"" instead of ""human-Controller."" Implying that lawyers aren't human.

Heyyyyy, Marco and Ax. Hope Tobias isn't interrupting anything.

LISTEN I'M NOT SORRY THAT MY INNER-SHIPPER IS GETTING THE NUTRIENTS THAT SHE NEEDS, BUT I'M SORRY YOU HAVE TO SEE HER SILLY COMMENTS.

Or am I?

>""Hospitals, labs, clinics, community blood banks — they all opened right up for us. Kind of scary when you think about it. Your complete medical history is just a click away, available to any nut-job with Internet access. But then we get to this one."" \[Marco\] motioned toward the computer screen. ""Midtown Bio-Services, Inc. Suddenly it's like breaking into the CIA.""

><Actually,> said Ax, <it was far more difficult. We experienced relative ease penetrating the Central Intelligence Agency databases.>

><The CIA?> I looked at Marco. <Wait. You hacked into their computer one day for kicks?>

>""Hey, the more information we can gather, the better prepared we'll be."" He shrugged. ""Besides, I gotta have something to do. It gets lonely hangin' here. I almost miss school. Okay. Maybe not. But unless you count the Victoria's Secret Web page, there are no babes in my life anymore.""

You don't need girls Marco. You have Ax!

Besides, I don't think most girls would be interested in a date that consisted of hacking into the CIA databases. Ax, on the other hand, clearly is.

Heh.

><There were no babes in your old life,> I said.

>""Oh. Very nice, Tobias. Go for the jugular. You've got Rachel tending to your every need. Me, I've got Ax-man."" He jerked his thumb toward Ax, who was gazing lovingly at a magazine ad for the new original M&M's. ""I'll trade you right now, straight across.""

I'm am not kidding when I say that I laughed so hard my eyes teared up reading that.

Also, Marco compared his relationship with Ax to Tobias's relationship with Rachel!! And also kind of said what I said!!

I knew Marco was a shipper at heart.

Anyway, we're flyin' off to...do something. Hang on, I'm sorry, it's been a day, I need to check and see what we're doing.

Ohhh we're going to Bio-Services place, alright.

Look it's elephants. And they're in a circus...

I just hope they're being treated well enough. There's not much time for Rachel to get over here and free them.

>A small brass plate beside the door said MIDTOWN BIO-SERVICES, INC. Below it hung a larger sign: NO SOLICITING.

Hey, I have that sign on *my* door!

You'd think that, by now, the Yeerks would know better than to have their buildings look all sinister and unfinished. Like, at least paint it or something, jeez.

>She saluted him with her trunk.

I love you, Rachel.

Fly morph for everyone but Rachel.

Rachel's goin' elephant. She's gonna cause a distraction, and destroy the Gleet Bio-Filter, and then slip away and blend in with the elephants from the circus! Simple!

>With her massive trunk, Rachel hurled the NO PARKING sign like a javelin toward the open doors.

You're awesome, Rachel.

Wait, Marco has a new morphing outfit? And it's blue? Like the buff Hork-Bajir's armbands...?

OH, they're making armbands for themselves. That's clever, unless they get caught...

Also, just look at this:

>I leaned over and plucked up a beakful of T-shirt. <Does this remind you of anything?>

>""Yeah."" He pulled his shirt from my mouth. ""It reminds me why I never wanted a pet bird.""

And this:

>Whoa."" He backed up against a row of metal shelves. ""You're looking at me like I'm lunch.""

><No,> I said. <We're looking at you like you're a giant armband.>

>...

>""No looking,"" he warned. ""There's no telling what the sight of my naked torso might make you do."" Marco turned to me. ""I'm lethal at the beach.""

>Cassie struggled to control a grin.

""If I can morph and they won't know,

I'll morph to someone else,""

\--""Morph"", by Twenty One Pilots, that just happened to play (okay, I chose the album it's in, Trench, on purpose, but I always forget that it's a part of that album).

><Ready?> Jake eased the door open. <Just act like you belong.> He stepped into the hall.

>Marco sauntered after him. <Famous last words. >

Oh, don't be so negative, Marco! I'm sure it will turn out fiiiiine--

>We marched down a nearly empty hall, turned the corner —

>— and stopped.

>Before us lay a narrow passageway. At the end was another pair of solid metal doors, guarded by an armed Hork-Bajir.

>The guard leveled his Dracon beam at us.

><Um,> Marco said. <Think we found their computer?>

Oh. Maybe not.

>""Pass?"" Jake turned toward us. He jerked his thumb at the guard. ""He wants pass! HA-HA- HA-HA!""

>Cassie and Marco laughed. ""HA-HA!""

Oh, we are so getting fried.

>""HA-HA!"" I clapped Ax on the shoulder. ""HA-HA-HA!""

>Ax frowned. ""Ha,"" he said.

THAT'S MY BOYYYY

Wait, everyone's fine? They got in by bluffing?  
Impossible!

Oh shit they found Loren. Tobias's mom.

YES LET'S GO WE'RE GONNA GET LOREN CONTENT!!!

Oopsie, they got caught.

Also:

""I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-ife,

I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i.""

\--""Chlorine"" by Twenty One Pilots.

Fitting.

Ax is erasing Loren's data. Good. I can't let the Yeerks get Loren.

Ohhh, Jake is pretending to be Ax/an Andalite by talking all proper? Interesting...

Oh we're fighting.

OH GOD THEY'RE GONNA KILL MARCO!

NO!

TOBIAS WITH THE SAVVVVVE

>And his own tail blades pierced his skull.

Jesus Christ. Glad that wasn't anyone I care about.

RACHEL WITH THE SAVVVVVE. WITH A STOLEN FORKLIFT.

We're running!

(Marco's pulling Ax to safety cause his hooves were slipping--)

Ax, Marco, and Tobias are safe. The others are--

>""You're dead.""

>TSSSSEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWW!

>The alley exploded.

Oh shit they're dead.

SHIT.

Nevermind they're fine.

Tobias is thinking about his mom.

>But not once, not one single time, did I imagine she lived eight blocks from me. That shepassed my house every single day. And kept going.

Damn that hits hard. Poor baby.

>I caught Ax's gaze. He gave me his mouthless Andalite smile. Warm. And sad.

One part of me: Awww, that's so sweet.

The other part of me: WAHHHHHH AFHAUIGFWAUGFAFG

>\[Rachel\] nodded. ""I know. I'll leave my window open.""

>A human boy would've kissed her then.

>The hawk-boy flew out of the hayloft toward the city

The coherent part of me: Awww, that's so sweet.

The other part of me: WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AWGRIFAJKLHKGKGUGAFYALIWYT

LOREN HAS BEEN SPOTTED.

I WANT TO TALK TO LOREN, PLEASE TALK TO HER.

And she's blind. YEAHHHH, BLIND REP.

LOREN I LOVE YOU.

>The dog stood still, waiting. She leaned down and scratched his neck. ""You're such a good boy, Champ.""

AND she loves her dog. I refuse to hear anything bad about Loren (besides, I know why she didn't raise Tobias because spoilers).

>She was poor, alone, maimed, and blind, and she volunteered at a crisis center.

What a queen.

>Cassie leaned back against the pen. ""I'm sorry, I'm just very tired. I spent most of the night out here, doing what I could for as long as I could."" She waved a hand toward the animals. ""Who's going to take care of these guys? If my dad's not here, they have zero chance of survival."" She closed her eyes. ""My dad. He doesn't have a clue what's coming.""

>""I know."" Rachel smiled ruefully. ""I spent last night helping Jordan practice her routine for the all-city gymnastics meet. And you know what? She nailed it. She could win the whole thing. Except she probably won't even get to compete. She was all excited, telling me how their coach got them all matching jackets. And I played along, like it was really going to happen. Like everything was normal.""

The coherent part of me: Awww, this is so SAD.

The other part of me: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH JKGASJAGFAGFJAFGAHFHAFWTWYAGFAGFWYFAYHVBDHWAF

Also, Jordan does gymnastics like Rachel? That's really cool!!

Alright, we're taking the families to the Hork-Bajir Valley. I'm sure nothing will go wrong.

Oh shit they're gonna tell Cassie's parents right now? I'm hyped.

>Clink-clink. I tapped my beak on the cup.

>\[Cassie's mom\] peered over the top of her paper. ""My. Aren't you a friendly hawk.""

><Sometimes,> I said. <Although Yeerks and small rodents might disagree.>

>She stared at me. ""Oooooo-kay."" Shook her head and raised the paper back up in front of her eyes. ""I did not hear that.""

><Not with your ears,> I said. <I'm speaking to your mind.>

LOL WHAT A WAY TO REVEAL IT.

>Then she carefully lowered the paper, folded it into a neat rectangle, and reached for her cup.

>""Coffee. I definitely need more coffee, because I'm still dreaming."" She scooted her chair back. ""I knew we shouldn't have switched to decaf.""

>""It's not the coffee, Mom.""

I--

>""He's a human in hawk form,"" Cassie went on patiently, like she was explaining a very complicated concept to a very young and innocent child. ""He's communicating through thought- speak. It's like telepathy.""

Cassie's mom indeed very innocent.

>Ax stepped forward and bowed.

><It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Cassie's Mother.>

What a polite young man.

>\[Cassie's dad\] stared at Ax. Rubbed his eyes and stared again. Frowned and peered down into his mug.

>""It's not the coffee, Walter.""

>""Sit down,"" Cassie said. ""Both of you.""

I love how they both had the same thought: It must be the coffee. True love at its finest, people.

Rachel's family next!

>We crept toward the kitchen. Rachel's sisters were lying on the living room floor in their pajamas. Too busy eating Pop-Tarts and watching TV to notice their sister, their cousin, an alien, and a red-tailed hawk slip past.

This is what TV does to you, kids.

>Her mother whirled. Backed up until she hit the wall. ""Wha —? Rachel, where are you? Jake, run! Go around front and get Sara and Jordan. Girls! Get out of the house!""

>""Sara and Jordan are fine, Aunt Naomi,"" Jake said, in his talking-to-psycho-relatives voice.

I see where Rachel gets it.

>""My babies! Leave them alone!"" Rachel's mom reached behind her and ripped a spice rack from the wall. And lunged at Rachel.

>Yes, lunged at a grizzly bear. With a spice rack.

I REALLY see where Rachel gets it.

Also:

><l have already made sure, Prince Jake. They think I am a ""pokey man."" I have told them I am an Andalite and am actually quite swift, but they insist they need to train me.>

AX, I CHOOSE YOU!

Oh boy, Jake's family next...

I'm listening to ""The Line"" by Twenty One Pilots. If only it had come out a few days earlier, while I was reading The Return, because this song really fits that book.

Anyway time for drama.

Uh oh they aren't home.

I think I know what's gonna happen next...

><Prince Jake?> Ax again. <Tom is infested with a ruthless, power-hungry Yeerk. And your parents —>

>""I know, Ax."" Jake slammed the basketball against the garage door. ""I know. My parents aren't safe with him. He tried to infest my dad with a Yeerk. He tried to . . . he tried to . . .""

>Kill him. Tom the Controller had tried to kill his own father.

DAMN I'M ALREADY SAD AND NOTHING'S HAPPENED YET.

NO IT'S A TRAP. THEY'RE CONTROLLERS.

DAMN JAKE'S MOM IS SHOOTING AT TOBIAS.

>The window rolled down. I caught a glimpse of Jake's mom. Her face, hard and twisted. Her hand, clenched. A glint of metal.

THIS SAD SONG IS MAKING ME EVEN SADDER NOOOO.

>In full view of his family, Jake morphed a peregrine falcon. His body shrank. Arms became wings. Feet became talons.

><This is for them.> His thought-speak was a whisper. <For my real family. To give them hope and, finally, the truth. And for their Yeerk captors. To give them warning.>

Aww he morphed in front of them.

I'm sad :(

>Then spread his wings and rose. <What's wrong with me? Why didn't I get them out last night? When I need to wait, plan, gather more information, what do I do? Charge in. Go for the surprise. Screw things up permanently. But when I need to charge in, to save the people I love most, I wait. I say, ""Go home. Get some rest. Sleep on it."" Great plan. I get sleep. My parents get Yeerks.>

Jake, this is a Tobias book. Things are supposed to be sad for TOBIAS, not for JAKE. Get it together.

But seriously, this is SAD.

Tobias is visiting Loren.

Make everything better, Loren. Please.

><The dog, man. The dog's your ticket.>

>Marco's thought-speak. I banked. An osprey and a northern harrier jetted up behind me. Marco and Ax.

><What are you guys doing here?>

><Protecting an endangered species,> Marco replied. <You.>

Marco jumpscare!

We're following Loren.

>Ax sidled up to him. ""Do not worry,"" he said. ""We are irresponsible teenage hoodlums, possibly gang members, but you are not in any danger.""

>The guy gave Ax a blank stare.

>""His gang's from out of town,"" I explained.

>Marco grabbed Ax's shirt and pulled him toward the back of the store. ""Smooth, Ax-man. That'll look real convincing on the surveillance tapes.""

Don't worry, Ax. You're still my favorite, even though I've been talking about Loren so much.

MARCO, DO NOT INSULT CHAMP!!! HE IS A GOOD BOY!

Loren is being pestered by a bunch of irresponsible teenage hoodlums, possibly gang members, but she's just ignoring them. She's the real Champ.

>She crossed to the coolers along the back wall, pulled out a quart of milk, and placed it in her basket. I could see the date stamped on the lid. The milk had expired three days ago.

>""Isn't that sweet?"" I jerked the basket from her hand. ""She's buying us a little snack."" I slid the milk out of the basket and replaced it with a fresh quart from the cooler.

Aww, he's getting her fresh milk.

What really happened to Elfangor: He went to get milk.

>""She does not seem to be afraid of us,"" Ax whispered.

>""She's probably been through worse,"" I said tightly.

>""Ah."" Ax nodded. ""She does not understand how menacing we are."" He tapped her on the shoulder. ""You do not know me,"" he said, ""but I am a juvenile delinquent. I do not trust authority figures, I probably will not graduate from high school, and statistics say my present rowdiness and vandalism will likely lead to more serious crimes. I am a dangerous fellow, and I am causing mayhem in this store.""

AX STOP MAKING ME LAUGH, THIS BOOK IS SUPPOSED TO BE SAD.

They are straight up kidnapping Loren's dog. This is the worst crime the Animorphs have ever committed. Forget genocide, and cold-blooded murder. They need to go to jail for dog-napping.

Tobias is morphing Champ!

>Ax slid a box from behind his back. ""I am truly a juvenile delinquent. I shoplifted these from your mother's basket, Tobias. I apologize.""

That's cute that he apologized.

>For the first time in my memory, my mother was touching me, and it was just as I'd always imagined it would be.

>Okay, so I never imagined I'd be covered in fur, puffing dog breath in her face. And the 7-Eleven wasn't part of the deal, either. In my fantasy, it was always nighttime, and she was tucking me into my race car bed. Yeah, I always wanted one of those red plastic race car beds. Seriously uncool, I know. Shoot me.

>But I always imagined her holding my face in her hands, just like she was doing now. And then, in my imagination, she'd pull me close and kiss my nose.

>Which is exactly what she did. Loren pulled my face to hers and planted a soft kiss on the tip of my rough, black nose. My dog body trembled. A soft whine bubbled up from my throat.

This is the longest quote so far, but I had to share this. Because it's so SAD but also so SWEET. K.A, STOP.

Oh she had amnesia?

YES, I KNEW LOREN WOULDN'T ABANDON TOBIAS FOR NO GOOD REASON!!!

>Okay, so I'd been watching too many soaps with Ax. I'd seen too many cases of TV amnesia cured by a visit from a long-lost love. But if it happened on TV, why couldn't it happen for me?

This is what TV will do to you, kids.........

HE'S GONNA MEET HER!!!!!!

ASGJKAGWAILGHS

>She nodded. Like she'd read my mind. ""It could have been you. I don't know. It's all so distant. The other images were terrifying. Aliens.""

>Aliens? I sat very still.

Does she remember Elfangor?

>""Look."" She pushed herself from the chair and felt for the counter. ""I think I know why you're here. You think I abandoned you. And I guess in a way I did."" She pulled a cup from the cabinet and filled it with coffee. ""But I couldn't raise a little boy alone. I was blind. Permanently. Facing years of physical therapy. You needed someone who could take care of you. Someone who at least remembered you.""

WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

SHE ALMOST REMEMBERS ELFANGOR!!!!

>\[Rachel\] leaned her head back against the chair. ""Please say you've come to rescue me from this place, Tobias. I've done nothing here but baby-sit my sisters and listen to my mother grouse about unsanitary bathroom conditions. Tell me you need my help. Tell me you're planning some senseless, suicidal mission. Tell me you can't pull it off without me.""

><All of the above,> I said. <For two days. I need your eyes, and I need your talons.>

>""Thank you. THANK you."" She closed her eyes. ""You've saved my sanity.""

True love.

>An argument had broken out between two groups of Hork-Bajir, the deciduous faction and the coniferous faction. They shouted and shook their clawed fists at each other.

The Yeerks and the Andalites have turned the Hork-Bajir violent...

We're saving Loren.

They're giving her the morphing power!

She's morphing Tobias!!

THE YEERKS ARE COMING.

><Tobias?> Her thought-speak was a whisper. <It can't be true.> She blinked her fierce eyes. <l can see. I can see. Tobias, I can see!>

As a person with impaired vision, this hits HARD.

Rachel's here!

""Hi Mom, I'm a hawk, you morphed me, your husband and my father was an alien, and my girlfriend's that elephant that just destroyed the wall of your house.""

""What?""

""Don't question it.""

WE'RE FLYIN'.

I hope Champ's all right...

This is INTENSE. I can't type much.

MARCO AND AX SAVVVVE!!!

RACHEL SAVVVVE!!!

Scooter time!

><So let's give them what they want,> I said. <Out the front. Into the parking lot.>

><ARE YOU INSANE?> Marco, of course.

><Yeah,> I said. <Aren't you?>

Yeah, Marco. Everyone's insane here.

LOREN SAVVVVVE!!

SHIT LOREN GOT SHOT SAVING TOBIAS.

SHIT SHIT SHIT DON'T DIE LOREN.

Okay she's demorphed. AND ALIVE.

CHAMP'S ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

>We retrieved Champ on the way back. Rachel had locked him inside an old car that was up on blocks behind somebody's house. He was one happy pup when we let him out. He about wagged himself in half. About licked Loren's face off. He was definitely glad to see her.

>And she was glad to see him. Glad? Make that elated, euphoric, ecstatic. She fell to her knees, held his face in her hands, and just looked at him. Looked at him and looked at him and looked at him. Tears rolled down her cheeks. She wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her face in his fur.

AWWWWW.

Tobias, you have a brother!

>""No."" I shrugged. ""I will. I just haven't figured out how. I mean, how do you tell somebody that she used to be married to an alien? That she loved him and he loved her, and that because of their love, they had . . . me? And then, after getting her all worked up over a husband she can't remember, say, 'Oh! And did I mention he's dead?""'

I don't really know what to say to that, but it's cute. And sad. R.I.P. Elfangor.

I got this kit from Amazon, and it was such a fun project! If anyone’s interested, here’s the link to the same one: \[[Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/YarnMate-Diamond-Painting-Kits-Rhinestone/dp/B0CYBQ3JLQ?th=1)\] For only 3.xx, it’s an absolute steal!

She seems to have very little nursing foundational knowledge or skills. Yesterday we spent two hours going over charting because we had to correct almost every single line of the patient assessment. I.e. skipping whole body systems, charting contradictory information i.e. patient has absent grasp/flexion/extension but follows commands on GCS, chatting unable to assess for edema because she said she didn’t think it was needed to pull back the sheet to see the whole patient. 

We also spent time going over how to read the vital sign machines because she said she didn’t know what any of the numbers represented. Yesterday she tried to prime a bag of heparin into the patient without disconnecting it from the patient and earlier in the week she said that cefepime was a drug used to treat blood pressures. 

We had a meeting with the educator where she said she was able to do assessments and give all meds independently and I explained my concerns. At the end of the shift she spend 45 minutes explaining how my behavior is extremely offensive to her when I give correction. She is from another county and let me know that I need to adapt to her culture to which I responded that I don’t mean to be offensive but I am going to provide correction where appropriate to ensure patient safety. I was also told that I am unapproachable and that the problem is my fault. I offered to find her another preceptor and she refused that. She consistently shows up to work drowsy and I have offered to buy her coffee or have her take frequent breaks. She let me know that she is not sleepy and that it’s my offensive behavior that makes her appear sleepy. (She also works full time at a SNF and has told me that she has worked 16+ shifts in a row between both jobs.)

I have reached out to my manager and educator because I am terrified that she is going to hurt someone.

1gxnirl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gxnirl,Review #3 - Old Particular Glen Spey 12,"**Intro:** I’d heard good things about Old Particular in the past, and I have enjoyed some tasting pours of other casks, but I have never seen a Glen Spey cask from them before. Curiosity got the better of me, and here we are. The whiskey is uncolored and unfiltered, but they say it’s at a “high alcohol strength,” which I would assume means it’s not a cask strength offering. It was aged in a refill hogshead, which lent itself to a notably pale spirit for the age, and some unique flavors I’ll get into later. 

**Distillery:** Glen Spey  
**Mashbill:** Single Malt  
**Age:** 12 years  
**Proof:** 96.8  
**Cost:** $80  

**Nose:** Right off the bat, this is really interesting. Super green and grassy notes, more like what I’ve come to expect from quality tequila than single malt. The malt is just barely discernible towards the end of the nose in the form of some coffee notes. However, they stay green and bright, reminding me more of a fruit-forward Ethiopian coffee than a darker roast. As you let this one sit and open up, sweeter notes start to come out, and personally I smell cheesecake and something that reminds me of pastry dough.  

**Palate:** The grassy notes fade quickly on the palate. There’s some smokiness, very light peat notes. It’s smooth, but not super flavor-dense. I get a bit of dark chocolate, some nutmeg and other spices, but all the notes are more subdued than I expected. It’s a tad thin in the mouth, but not terribly so. 

**Finish:** The finish is long, leaving the taste of cacao nibs lingering on the tongue; strongly bitter, but not unpleasant. 

**Overall:** This whiskey was very light both on the nose and the palate. It came off to me as more delicate than robust, which is unique but not unwelcome for a scotch. I especially appreciated how transparent the brand is about their cask sourcing, and the fact that this was additive free, save possibly from some water to proof it down. The one oddity was how hard it was for me not to think of agave spirit when I was enjoying this scotch. The specific notes that lead me there are different from those I’d associate with a lack of age, so I’m not quite sure what caused that note to come through so strongly. I happen to enjoy quality tequila or mezcal on occasion, so I welcome the change of pace, but if that doesn’t sound like your idea of a good dram, this might be one to avoid. This was a good experience, but I’ve had better scotch, both at and below the $80 price point they’re asking for this one. Not a terrible deal, but I’d probably only recommend this one if you can taste it first, or if you’re really looking for something different to add to a big collection.

1gxnhd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HallmarkMovies/comments/1gxnhd7/merry_christmas_pet_peeve/,"""Merry Christmas"" pet peeve","One pet peeve of mine with the Hallmark Christmas movies is people saying “Merry Christmas” as a greeting or as “goodbye” with every other conversation, even weeks out from the holiday. In real life most people only say it really close to the holiday or on the holiday, not as a common greeting on the 14th. Some may say “have a merry Christmas” when they say goodbye if they aren’t going to see each other before the holiday, or as a farewell at a store (or Happy Holidays, given how many holidays there are in December). But in some movies it’s constant all the way through, and if you pay attention to it, it will get really annoying really fast! 

Has anyone else noticed it? I don't know if it bothers me as much as the magical tiny suitcase filled with many coats, the empty coffee cups, and the over decorating in every single room of people's houses and offices, but this one does bug me quite a bit!

Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1giiide/aita_for_feeling_like_my_parents_are_replacing_me/

Those two links are what happened until now. Also, this will be the final update, because I'm mostly done and tired of this whole drama and I can't think of anything else that may add to that story.

The birthday party came and went and it was pretty much like I thought it was going to be. Except that both my mother as well as my brother tried to include me more  than before and in general? It was nice. Everyone was happy and I had a nice time as well. I didn't feel like an outsider all of the time, just... a little bit which is more than I can usually say.

As for the other three guests - my ex-parents in law excused themselves. But they invited for coffee on that day and I got my favorite cake. I still have a pretty solid relationship with them and I hope it holds. And my ex-partner - now trying to act like my best friend again because that was who they were before our relationship - didn't show up either. Ex claimed that it would be too uncomfortable for them since my parents could make a comment or something about why they broke up with me and they didn't want to expose themselves to that.

You could say that our relationship is a bit strained, with some of the stuff they said during the break up still doesn't sit right with me. Like how I and my problems are a huge burden to them and that I'm nothing more than a doormat. Maybe I've just grown angry and bitter since the one person who I thought would never hurt me did that so easily and seems to thrive now that they're single once more. Sometimes it feels like I can't recognize them any more, but oh well. They just have to realize and accept that they lost a whole lot off my trust. Also, I've been in contact with another old friend more and made two new friends that way. So yeah, things aren't looking that bleak anymore.

As for my family and future - since I set up some boundaries and stuck with them - they're in general more careful with me. I already went LC with them, but if they decide to pull some bullshit again, I told them the concequences, meaning that I would lower it even more. I've already heard my mother talk about how she misses me and how I'm not around as much any more so... I hope with time they can accept that I may be their daughter, and not the offspring who never did meet their expactions.

With that - thank you to everyone who read and left a comment. You made me smile in different times and your words gave me some options I hadn't thought of before. Take care.",2,1732323496.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

Help me find a ebook from about 15 years ago

Ok so I’m trying to remember the title of this book. I’m not sure if it was ever an actual print book or just a kindle book. But basically the book was about this kid who had to like write a paper or something so he stayed up all night trying to write it. Then it turns out that like everyone who has fallen asleep won’t wake up. This kid meets up with these other kids and they ride their bikes around trying to figure out what’s going on. There are also talking animals for some reason- like the cats can talk and help the characters because of some reality breaking thing. They find out at the end when people are asleep they are transported to this island where there are monsters that are going around trying to eat people.

I know- absolute fever dream of a book but I remember being SUPER into it when I was like 12. Was trying to describe it to someone today and she 100% believes I just made it up because I was a hospital kid and spent a lot of time by myself reading books and making up stories. 

I might be remembering some of the details wrong but I remember the biggest part was the kids couldn’t go to sleep or they would never wake up so they drank a lot of coffee and stuff…. lol

There was also a part where they get trapped in a lab or green house or something and there is this gas that is going to make them sleep,if it gets to them or something. Details are hazy because I’m sure it was some random free book I found since I had exhausted my school’s library

I first have to give you some details as to how my husband and I met. At a very young age my family and I moved to a different country but never failed to come back to our home country for vacation anytime we could. I met my husband in my home country at the age of 16F and he was 18M. We stared dating a year after meeting each other. I have to admit  I was hesitant at first because of the distance but we were both young and oblivious as to how hard things would actually be. Irregardless, we somehow “made it work.” We are coming up on our eight year anniversary next month. However, I would be lying if I say we didn’t have our huge ups and downs. Around our five-year anniversary we took a mutual agreement to break up. This was because as we grow older, we came to the realization that our life goals didn’t quite lineup. Along with the fact that we both became super busy, and communications lacked off completely from both sides. It was super hard at first, but when we were about six months into being single, he came looking for me again. That being said when he came back looking for me, I made sure to lay everything down on the table and be clear on what my wants were. At this time him and I still were in a long distance situation and for a very, very long time I was considering the possibility of moving back to my home country just because I loved it so much better than where I was living. So when Covid hit and I lost my job and collage classes became virtual; I finally decided to make the move and I asked him for help on finding an apartment because he knew the city a lot more than I did. By this time we were already dating again and he suggested that instead of moving into an apartment by myself, we should rent a house together, so in other words move in together. I didn’t need much convincing because I still had so much love for this man. To this day, we have been living in the same house for two years now. A couple months into living with together he proposed and within a year we managed to get married. 
          Unfortunately, exactly a week before our wedding day the closest person to my husband who was also his best friend and cousin; passed away in a tragic car accident. I have to admit that he was my favorite cousin from his side of the family as well. That being said, we both opted to canceling the wedding, but by request of the cousins parents we went through with the wedding. Although I tried to keep my head on the game and focus on what  was really important which was getting married, I can’t lie and say that it didn’t sour my big day. I figured that someday I will learn to look past that. The one thing that I could not look past by is the fact that my husband, out of depression became an alcoholic. It has been eight months now and although things have gotten a little better and I have tried helping by suggesting therapy, going to therapy with him, things just don’t seem to stop. I must say that I have never been through such traumatic experience myself, but in my mind, I wished he was able to see how much his alcoholism is affecting our relationship and he would stop. A couple days ago was his cousins eight month death anniversary and we went to visit his grave. After we left the cemetery they continued drinking at one of his cousins house. His cousin lives fairly close to our house so around 12 AM I asked my husband to drive me back home and he drove back to his cousins in which case I asked him not to come home too late but around 4 AM. I woke up and I realize that he wasn’t home yet. His phone must’ve died because I kept on calling and went straight to voicemail and he has never not pick up. I waited a couple hours and nothing so by this time his mom who lives right next to us, messaged and asked where he was at in which case I told her I assume he was still at his cousins house. Without having to tell her, she immediately came to the realization that he must’ve been drinking and decided to go and make him come home. Obviously, this started an argument between both him and I. I asked him if he thought it was ok for a married man not to come home to sleep, after being out with his friends drinking all day long. Mind you, this was a repeated occurrence by this time. To which he replied that he didn’t see the problem. so I told him that if it was me, he wouldn’t like it and he said that he has never tells me anything when I go out with my friends, but when I go out with my friends I never do such things. All I do is go out to get some coffee and eat.
         This lead to home telling me that he no longer wanted to be with me because I was super unfair in the relationship. That I went out all the time and he never says a thing to me. Also, that I made him feel like I treated him more like a child rather than his husband. And I have to admit, by this time we have already had soooo many problems that arise from him being drunk, that I do find myself trying to stop him from drinking. 
I hate that controlling side of me but I swear that it’s almost an unconscious reaction I have the minute I see him drinking. He doesn’t get physical but he says things that hurt like hell. And when he told me the other day that he didn’t want to be with me anymore, I took his word and I left.  Later that night when he came home he called me panicking because he didn’t see me or my belongings home. We have talked once since this happened. I told him to take time a get his shit together and figure out whether he wants to be with me or not. But I do need to drinking to stop, otherwise I won’t come back. But dammit this hurts like nothing else in the world! I’m so I love with him and I can’t even believe that only 8 months into my marriage I’m already going through this shit. Part of me thinks that if he really loved me, this behavior should’ve stopped long algo. I’m so hurt and my mind is a scramble. I don’t even know if I’ll believe he’s behavior will change if he comes back looking for me. Or if he’ll even come back. I guess I’m just need to know whether I did the right thing by leaving because part of my feels guilty for leaving him when I know he is also fighting his demons.?
