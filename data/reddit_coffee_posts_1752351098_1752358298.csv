I’ve been trying to remember the name of a movie I watched on VHS a lot as a kid, probably in the late 90s or early 2000s, but the movie itself might be from the 80s or 90s. It was a family-style movie (not horror, not Disney) and it felt theatrical—not a made-for-TV movie.

Here’s what I remember:
	•	A group or troop of younger kids (definitely not teens) is away at some kind of summer camp or nature program.
	•	They do a lot of canoeing or kayaking—this was a big part of the movie.
	•	There’s some sort of rivalry or competition with another group (maybe across the lake or from a different camp?).
	•	At some point, leeches are used as a prank—I’m pretty sure they put leeches into someone’s bathtub or coffee mug in a cabin, camper, or trailer.
	•	The tone was light/funny—not scary or fantasy. No monsters, aliens, or horror.
	•	I vaguely remember the VHS box showing a lake or forest scene with kids, maybe with canoes or paddles.

It’s not:
	•	Stand By Me
	•	The Amazing Panda Adventure
	•	Heavyweights
	•	Camp Nowhere
	•	Leeches!
	•	Any horror movie

If anyone remembers this or has suggestions, I’d be so grateful! I’ve been trying to find it for years.",1,1752358222.0,whatsthatmoviecalled,0,1.0,False

I’m a 51-year-old cuddle companion in Edmonton, AB, offering companionship and platonic touch to women who are looking for warmth, connection, and a safe space to simply be. 

With a background in psychology, I understand just how vital safe, nurturing touch can be for our emotional, mental, and even physical well-being. I bring that understanding into every session—creating a calm, judgment-free environment where you are seen, respected, and genuinely cared for. Whether you're navigating stress, loneliness, healing from past experiences, or simply craving human closeness in a healthy way, I’m here to offer support through the power of presence and nonsexual touch. 

Those I've cuddled with in the past often describe me as grounded, gentle, and deeply attentive. I'm someone who values authentic connection—not just through cuddling, but also through deep conversation, shared silence, or moments of light-hearted laughter. When I’m not working, you’ll find me walking in nature, curled up with a good book, sipping strong coffee, or singing just for the joy of it. I find that these simple things—music, movement, and meaningful dialogue—mirror the kind of peace and presence I hope to offer in every session. 

Whether it’s your first experience with a cuddle companion or something you’ve explored before, I’ll meet you where you’re at—with kindness, professionalism, and a deep respect for your boundaries. This is your space to be cared for, held, and heard. 

If you feel drawn to this kind of connection, I’d be honored to walk beside you. Let’s create something healing together.",1,1752358177.0,u_SafeHavenCuddlerYEG,0,1.0,False

I met someone last year from another state—he has family here. We started talking with no expectations since we were both going through tough stuff, but we developed feelings. I’ll be honest, I messed up two or three times, and each time it hurt the relationship. I was still dealing with my ex and other things, and I often felt like I shouldn’t be talking to someone new. I tried to break it off, but every time I did, I realized I liked him more than I thought—and eventually realized I was in love.

At one point I started consuming a lot of online content about what women should expect in relationships, and it made me feel like my needs weren’t being met, so I’d pull back. I’m naturally clingy—he actually said he liked that because no one had ever wanted him the way I did. I really liked him for who he was, even the parts we didn’t have in common. I even wanted to learn more about those things so he could share them with me, but I also respected that some of those interests were his space.

I used to send him food or coffee gift cards—not to impress him, just because I wanted him to be happy. I wanted us to be together in person one day. And he always said he wanted to make it work, that I was the love of his life, and he’d never hurt me.

When we argued, he’d say he wasn’t enough for me. But my anxiety took over and I thought maybe he just wanted to let me go. I figured if I didn’t feel like enough, I could work on myself—so why couldn’t he?

We took a break after a fight, and I agreed it might be best. But one thing stuck with me: he said he started seeing “red flags” in me. That hurt. I’ve tried to change how I come across to be better, but now I wonder—was that his way of letting go without fully saying it?

He agreed to the space. Maybe he didn’t want to walk away himself, so this gave him an out. I caved today and told him I miss him and that I’m scared I’ll get over him.

So if you’ve ever been in a situation like this—

Yet every application cycle ended the same way silence. I finally realized it wasn’t the market or “bad timing” that was screwing me over. It was my approach. Here are the big reasons I kept striking out:

1. One size fits all resume: I used a pristine template but never tweaked the bullet points to match each job’s priorities.
2. Spray‑and‑pray outreach: I applied to dozens of roles with zero focus—no research on the team or the person on the other side of the screen.
3. No follow‑up whatsoever: After hitting “submit,” I’d move on and forget about it—no polite check‑ins or brief “still interested” notes.
4. Neglected my network: I was too shy to DM alumni or former colleagues, so I never leveraged the only real insider channel I had.
5. Not using whizreach: I was manually hunting down recruiters one by one instead of testing the one click AI that queues and personalizes outreach.
6. Ignored response data: I never tracked which subject lines or email intros actually got opened—so I kept repeating the same mistakes.

But those bullet points only tell half the story. Behind every unfinished application was a midnight panic attack my hands shaking as I tried to reframe the same three achievements over and over. I’d sit in a coffee shop for hours, watching the barista’s espresso machine hiss, wondering why I couldn’t crack the code. My self‑esteem took hits every time I saw the “Application received” message without a follow up. Friends threw suggestions my way “Try volunteering,” “Learn a new skill,” “Just be patient” but none of it addressed the blind spots in my own process.

I eventually built a little spreadsheet to track every submission: date, role, point of contact, subject line, response (if any). Reviewing two hundred rows of mostly “no reply” crushed me but it also revealed patterns: certain email intros got a handful of opens, while others languished untouched. That data gave me the courage to refuse the next role that was clearly a bad fit, even if it meant waiting longer. It also forced me to carve out actual “application hours” instead of letting it bleed into every evening.

By treating my hunt like a project with real metrics, honest self‑reflection, and a willingness to scrap entire tactics. I started seeing recruiter replies almost immediately. It wasn’t a magic trick; it was the product of ruthless self‑audit and small pivots. Now when I look back at those nights of endless typing and cold coffee, I’m grateful for the wake up call: hiring isn’t about shouting the loudest, it’s about showing up smarter.",3,1752357533.0,jobhunting,3,0.8,False

1lyc57a,https://www.reddit.com/r/GearUpGaming/comments/1lyc57a/acemagic_gaming_laptop_156_the_budget_beast_that/,"ACEMAGIC Gaming Laptop 15.6"": The Budget Beast That Actually Delivers (My Honest Take)","
Look, I've been through enough budget gaming laptops to know that most of them are basically expensive paperweights with RGB lighting. But when I got my hands on the **ACEMAGIC Gaming Laptop 15.6""**, I had to admit – this thing actually surprised me. And trust me, I'm not easily impressed when it comes to affordable gaming rigs.

## **What Makes the ACEMAGIC Gaming Laptop Stand Out?**

The **ACEMAGIC AX15 laptop** isn't trying to be the next gaming monster that'll run Cyberpunk 2077 at ultra settings. Instead, it knows exactly what it is: a solid entry-level gaming laptop that won't break your bank account or your back when you're lugging it around campus.

Here's what caught my attention right off the bat:

The **AMD Ryzen 7 5700U processor** paired with **Radeon RX Vega 8 graphics** creates a surprisingly capable combo for budget gaming. Yeah, it's not going to compete with dedicated gaming GPUs, but for the price point? It's honestly impressive what this **8 core 16 thread laptop** can handle.

The **16GB RAM** configuration means you're not constantly fighting memory limitations, and that **512GB SSD** ensures your games actually load before you finish your coffee. FYI, I've tested plenty of budget laptops that still ship with traditional hard drives – it's painful :/ 

[Check out the ACEMAGIC Gaming Laptop on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4nJi7t6)

## **Gaming Performance: The Real Talk**

Let's be honest about what you're getting here. The **ACEMAGIC gaming laptop performance** sits comfortably in the ""casual to moderate gaming"" category. I've put it through its paces with several popular titles, and here's what I found:

**Games that run smoothly:**
- League of Legends (60+ FPS on high settings)
- Valorant (solid 60+ FPS)
- Minecraft (even with some mods)
- Older AAA titles like GTA V (medium settings, 45-60 FPS)

**Games that require some compromise:**
- Modern AAA titles (you'll need to dial down settings)
- GPU-intensive indie games
- Anything requiring ray tracing (obviously)

The **integrated graphics gaming** experience here is actually better than I expected. The **AMD Radeon graphics laptop** setup handles most esports titles without breaking a sweat, which is exactly what most budget gamers need.

## **Design and Build Quality: Surprisingly Solid**

The **ACEMAGIC 15.6 inch laptop** doesn't scream ""gaming laptop"" from across the room, which might actually be a good thing if you're using it for work or school. The **metal body laptop** construction feels sturdy enough to survive the daily grind, though I wouldn't recommend using it as a frisbee.

The **15.6 FHD display** delivers crisp visuals at **1920x1080 resolution**, and the colors are decent enough for both gaming and media consumption. It's not an IPS panel, so don't expect perfect viewing angles, but for the price point, it gets the job done.

One feature I genuinely appreciate is the **backlit keyboard gaming** setup. It's not just about looking cool (though it does) – it's actually functional when you're gaming in low light conditions. The key travel feels responsive, and I haven't experienced any ghosting issues during intense gaming sessions.

## **Specs Breakdown: What You're Actually Getting**

Let me break down the **ACE AX15 specs** in plain English:

**Processor:** AMD Ryzen 7 5700U (8 cores, 16 threads)
**Graphics:** AMD Radeon RX Vega 8 (integrated)
**Memory:** 16GB DDR4 RAM
**Storage:** 512GB NVMe SSD
**Display:** 15.6"" Full HD (1920x1080)
**Connectivity:** WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, USB-C, HDMI

The **NVMe SSD gaming laptop** configuration means boot times are snappy, and game loading is significantly faster than traditional hard drives. The **WiFi 6 gaming laptop** capability ensures you're not bottlenecked by your internet connection during online gaming sessions.

## **Who Should Actually Buy This Thing?**

The **ACEMAGIC gaming laptop** hits a sweet spot for specific types of users. IMO, it's perfect for:

**Students who game casually:** You need something that handles schoolwork during the day and League of Legends at night. This laptop delivers on both fronts without the ""gaming laptop"" stigma in lecture halls.

**Budget-conscious gamers:** If you're looking for a **gaming laptop under $500**, this represents solid value. You're getting modern specs and decent performance without the premium price tag.

**First-time gaming laptop buyers:** The **budget gaming laptop for beginners** market is flooded with questionable options. This one actually works as advertised.

**Esports enthusiasts:** Most competitive games run great on this setup. The **laptop gaming experience** for titles like Valorant, CS2, and Rocket League is smooth and responsive.

## **The Not-So-Great Stuff (Because I'm Honest Like That)**

Every budget laptop has compromises, and the **ACEMAGIC AX15** is no exception. Here's what might annoy you:

The **integrated graphics gaming** limitation means you'll struggle with demanding AAA titles. If you're expecting to run the latest Call of Duty at high settings, you'll be disappointed.

Battery life during gaming is... well, let's just say keep your charger handy. The **AMD processor gaming laptop** setup is efficient for general use, but gaming sessions will drain the battery quickly.

The speakers are adequate but not impressive. You'll want decent headphones or external speakers for the best gaming experience.

## **How Does It Stack Up Against the Competition?**

When comparing **ACEMAGIC vs Acer Nitro** or **ACEMAGIC vs HP Pavilion**, the ACEMAGIC holds its own in the budget category. The Acer Nitro series typically costs more but offers dedicated graphics. The HP Pavilion gaming laptops often have better build quality but less performance per dollar.

The **ACEMAGIC vs ASUS TUF** comparison is interesting – ASUS has better brand recognition and support, but ACEMAGIC offers more bang for your buck in terms of raw specs.

## **My Final Verdict: Worth It or Skip It?**

After using the **ACEMAGIC Gaming Laptop 15.6""** for several weeks, I can honestly say it delivers on its promises. It's not trying to be something it's not, and that's refreshing in a market full of overhyped budget ""gaming"" laptops.

**Is ACEMAGIC good for gaming?** For casual and esports gaming, absolutely. For hardcore AAA gaming, you'll need to manage expectations or save up for something more powerful.

The **ACEMAGIC laptop price** represents solid value in the current market. You're getting modern specs, decent build quality, and actual gaming capability without the premium price tag.

**Should you buy it?** If you need a **budget gaming laptop 2025** that actually works, this is a solid choice. Just make sure your gaming expectations align with what integrated graphics can deliver.

The **ACEMAGIC gaming laptop worth buying** question ultimately depends on your specific needs and budget. For students, casual gamers, and anyone looking for their first gaming laptop, it's a smart pick that won't leave you disappointed.

Remember, perfect is the enemy of good – and this laptop is definitely good enough for most people's gaming needs :)",1,1752357121.0,GearUpGaming,0,1.0,False

Just enter the person’s name and run this prompt. It will automatically:

* Scrape LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Meetup & Eventbrite for their public profiles
* Extract every past event and the next 6 months of RSVPs/attendances
* Spot patterns in their meetup habits
* Forecast up to 8 upcoming events (only those with ≥30% chance they’ll attend)
* Provide an **Attendance %** and **Networking-Openness %** for each
* Identify where in the venue they’ll network (coffee area, lobby, reception, etc.)
* List the easiest entry method (free RSVP, ticket, guest badge, speaker intro)
* Back everything up with URLs or post snippets

You’ll get a tidy table to pick the best dates, times, and places to meet them.

    You are an expert at mapping real-world habits from public online footprints. Focus exclusively on data from LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Meetup, and Eventbrite. Given [Elon Musk]’s public profiles and posts, do the following:
    
    1. **Patterns Summary**  
       • Identify recurring event types, locations, rhythms.
    
    2. **Event Extraction**  
       • List every past and upcoming event (date, time, venue) they’ve RSVPed to or attended in the last year and next 6 months.
    
    3. **6-Month Forecast**  
       • Forecast the top 8 upcoming events they’re most likely to attend.  
       • For each, give **Attendance Probability (%)**—only include events with ≥30%.
    
    4. **Networking Readiness**  
       • For each event, estimate **Networking Openness Probability (%)** based on event type and their role.
    
    5. **Venue Behavior**  
       • Specify where they’ll likely spend peak networking time (coffee area, exhibitor hall, reception, etc.).
    
    6. **Access Tips**  
       • Note the easiest entry method (free pass, ticket, guest badge, speaker intro).
    
    7. **Evidence**  
       • Attach URLs or post excerpts that support each forecast.
    
    **Limit Output** to 8 rows (events with Attendance ≥30%), sorted by Attendance Probability.
    
    **Output** a table with columns:  
    | Event Name | Date | Time | Venue & City | Attendance % | Networking % | Likely Area | Entry Method | Evidence |

1lyc3ta,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1lyc3ta/frequent_constipation_and_stomach_pain/,Frequent constipation and stomach pain,"I have frequent bouts of constipation and I'm not sure what I else I'm supposed to do to alleviate it. I take fiber supplements, drink at least 2L of water per day, eat plenty of probiotics and vegetables and exercise 4 times a week. I drink coffee every morning and sometimes it works to stimulate a bowel movement, but it doesn't work every time. I can feel that my colon is full and I should need to go, but I don't have any sensation that I need to go to the bathroom. Pushing is bad, so I don't do that, and I've tried just sitting on the toilet every time I feel something, but it doesn't work all the time.

Lately, when I know I need to eat, sometimes I have pain in my abdomen on my upper and middle left side instead of typical stomach hunger feelings. The couple bowel movements I had over the last week have been small and I feel like there should be more coming out, especially when it's supposed to be 2 full days worth. I also feel the pain when I eventually have a large bowel movement (like this morning). There's nothing irregular about my stool - the color and density are all normal. 

What gives? Has anyone else experienced this? Is it time to see a specialist? Is it a sign there's something wrong? I've told my doctor about this and he just suggested I eat more fiber. I appreciate your insights. ",2,1752357014.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False

3.) Seeing a morbidly obese family walk in with a child younger than 5 already having forehead fat is so disheartening, I'm actively watching someone eat themselves to death while teaching their child how to do it and what foods get them closer to death
4.) My bosses boss doesn't know how to operate on the floor but he expects me to find the time to properly organize the donuts so they look nice
5.)

Then today I went on what may very well be the worst first date of my life with a man who opened with a loooong story about a bulging blood cyst in his leg that had to be drained multiple times, compulsively picked out his earwax for 90 minutes, interrupted every single thing I said, and spent the whole time mansplaining things to me, but with demonstrably wrong and incorrect information. He even tried to explain my own career and industry to me, telling me the things that I was saying about that industry were incorrect. I work in clean energy, he is a sound technician for nightclubs.

I’m a conversational person and I’ve always been able to have a pleasant couple of hours over coffee, chatting with anyone I’ve gone on a date with -even if there’s zero spark. In 20 years of dating this is the first time I’ve *ever* been compelled to blurt out, “Look, this isn’t working at all and I’m going to leave now. Goodbye.”

How do you keep your head in the game? Do you have any advice? I don’t want to waste time feeling despondent and hopeless, but my experiences on hinge and bumble over the last year and a half make me feel like maybe there are no good folks left in our age bracket.",4,1752356640.0,datingoverforty,13,1.0,False

They come and go as a dull bareable stabbing feeling that lasts a few seconds. But I'll have an episode of it that lasts around an hour where it comes and goes a couple times. I've never had an ice pick headaches before so I'm not sure if it's nerve pain from my neck or it's a headache. I was having eye strain feelings as well that would come and go yesterday and the day before.

I don't have any other symptoms that may be concerning, only the head ache. It's been day like 5 of these happening. I usually do get migraines a lot or headaches.

I cut out coffee last week because I'm having side effects of heart palpations from my SSRI withdrawal, don't know if that's why? I usually have coffee everyday. Maybe I'm also over thinking it and it's making it worse, cause I do tend to get anxious over headaches and I get stressed at work a lot.

The brink of autonomous apocalypse: the harsh reality of gen z 

Terrence McKenna referred to it as novelty but I refer to it as hell. Time isn’t just speeding up its damn near fucking ending. Things aren’t just becoming more creative, they are becoming more degenerate than ever before. I sit up from my pitiful doomscrolling soaking in rot, as I get up I check my Snapchat. Nobody has responded for god knows how long and I feel like I just crawled out of a godforsaken cave of shit and piss only to feel no emotions, sit back on my ass. And start scrolling fuckass tik tok again.

This isn’t just novelty, this is the pinnacle of the possibilities of novelty theory. Yes there will be technological advancements but at what cost? What have we been reduced to as a society?

Maybe gen z should be referred to as “the lost generation” and millennials are “our last hope”. “The chosen generation”. yes , they are annoying scum who aren’t funny and will be the next boomers pretty soon but by god WTF ARE WE ??!! We are the first of the last generations. Sucked into a world of sick dismay and grueling realities. The millennials make stupid fucking online videos and are currently the next generation of parents but Adleast they are still a real generation.

They wake up , drink some coffee, say “ u knowh wut wood bee phunny if I made a home cooking video and laughed for no reason after almost every word in the video and then saying “witterawwy” (literally) after every sentence and rolling on the ground of laughter. Then they stop the video, get in their Subaru cross trek, and head to Whole Foods for more home-cooking ingredients. Millennials are the reason that gen z turned out so shit. Yeah they are optimistic sons of bitches but their successors are true degenerates.

Wake up , take a fat rip of the microplastic radiation flavored “unicorn piss galore” then they take a nice fat rip off a backpackboyzz 4g cart flavored “dogpound daze” after that it’s time to put some fucking clothes on. Some baggy fuckass pants with a homeless looking shirt and some sambas or maybe.. nah just sambas. Then get in mommy or daddies car and head to school. At school it’s time to get in gear and do some real work.

This schoolwork consists of hitting up class group chats dedicated to cheating and tomfoolery. Then when nobody responds to the stupid asss group chat,  it’s time to open chat gpt to write us a whole essay about why I am a good candidate for the “merit scholarship”, to a college they only want to go to for the bad bitties oh and either “business” or “psychology” cause it “sounds kinda fun I guess”. Next it’s time to head to the bathroom for a good vape and cart break.

Lurking in the bathroom is somehow a more defeated person. skinny jeans, jordans, a hoodie, and a sideways hat. “Aye cuh I know u got that cart wayyy. Sakee cart wayyy”. Then you proceed to lock youself in the stall and rip the nicotine salts which contain 50x the nicotine our grandparents were smoking followed by a “blinker” of pesticide cart.

This is the daily lifestyle of the majority of gen z degenerates. No matter your gender your day will look similar to this godforsaken bullshit that is somehow a lifestyle and a daily routine.

As we hit the vape and cart we are experiencing novelty, but how could this be novelty? Doing the same bullshit every day with no hope of getting your head out of the water. Just endless bobbing up and down.

Oh, it’s novelty because when I open my Tik tok in the stall after getting my hits of unpleasant dopamine I see that a little Palestinian kid is carrying his family across a destroyed and battered landscape covered In corpses and rubble. Calling out for help as he drags his dead father across a 1 sided battlefield. Onlookers watch as the poor child screams for help but nobody stops. Nobody cares.

This is the shitty unbelievable reality that gen z experiences day by day, night by night. It’s novelty but at what cost? Was this Terrence McKennas vision? A toxic wasteland of a society held up by the threads of constant dread and political terror.

1lybr49,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lybr49,A German Vegitarian Ration!,"Hi folks!

A German Type 5 with a best by date of Sep2024. This one was hit by customs who decided the Vegitarian dumplings could not be permitted into the country because they contain egg. Yikes. Shout-out to u/Gliterring_Eye for the trade that netted me this one!

This is a Vegitarian menu that, for some reason, contains tuna. A bit odd. A couple unique items in here because of the Vegitarian label. 

Pics 1-6 show packaging and contents.

Pics 7-8 show the biscuits and jam! These are great biscuits,  crunchy, and flaky with a slightly sweet touch. I love the German jams, they are so thick and fruity. Just slice them and add em to your biscuits!

Pic 9 shows the energy bar. A solid bar with great blueberry flavor.

Pics 10-11 is one of my favs, the freeze-dried fruit. In this case it's apples and apricots I think. Pic 10 is dry (my preferred way of having it) and Pic 11 is reconstituted.

Pic 12 is the dried fruit. A great mix with fantastic texture, crunch, and sweetness.

Pic 13 is the Vegitarian spread, a tomato paprika blend. This was not my fav by itself, so I decided to mix it into a Mountain House Buffalo Mac and Cheese I had, and man was that a great idea! Made it even more rich and creamy!

Pic 14 is the chocolate cookies. These are small but pack a satisfying crunch and flavor. A great pocket snack for sure!

Pic 15 is the chocolate.  I love dark chocolate and this German stuff is perfectly adequate. Nice snap,  rich flavor, and great taste.

Pic 16 is a sesame bar. We see these in German, British,  and other rations. This one was in perfect condition. Sweet, toasty flavor with a fantastic crunch! No teeth breaking here, these were delicate and delicious. 

Pic 17 is the chocolate Muesli. Not the best and not the worst I've had. An inoffensive breakfast made with cold water this go around.

Pic 18 is the meatless chili (Sin Carne, without meat). This was a great dish and even had corn in it! No way you'd notice this was meat free. Great chili flavors, lots of hearty beans, very filling...a great meal.

In conclusion,  even with the absence of the last meal this was a great ration. Give one a try! I have 2 more of these so I will get to try that last main at some point!

Take care!

Please check description.,"Me M31, divorced, wants to limit my friendship with a co-worker who is F26. She is the best looking office girl who is showered with all the love and gifts from all the genders. 
However, me on the other hand, do not feel that this is a good start for us. Lately, our friendship has grown immensely. She randomly started talking to me and me being a shy, reserved guy, am just giving my everything to her. There is no personal boundaries that she is respecting, right from my diet food, to using my personal things like lip balm, perfumes, locker, coffee mug, jacket, my breaks, my face serum, lotion, amazon prime account (might even steal jackets) soon but it's rainy season in India. Instinctively, a guy might think that she is into me because of the way she talks to me and wants my attention as soon as I enter office. She already has a seat reserved for me. But I'm slowly fraying away from my colleagues (my department). 

The dark side to this is, on weekends, there is no talking (she asked my number and I'm not on any social media platforms). There is no communication on weekends. She is randomly updating stories on whatsapp with her date which she casually tells me on Monday that her ex wanted to meet her. This has been a pattern since 4 weeks. 

The positive side to this is, that I have stopped smoking during work. From smoking a pack a day, I smoke only 2 cigarettes in the entire day as my entire break is spent with her, I have to poop at home. 

Since my divorce and passing away of a female best friend, I have decided not to date or fall in love with any person. This colleague is distracting me from my goals and I'm afraid of falling in love with somebody who only thinks about themselves. She is a 10/10 and knows that I'm a divorcee. I have told her that my intentions are not to fall in love with anyone neither I am looking at dating. 

Please help me how to politely get away from this colleague? As I easily get influenced (just like my marriage). I already have enough on my plate and don't want to be a door mat or yesman in somebody ELSE'S life. I do not want to play mindgames either. She is persuasive and easily convinces me if I tell her that I want to be left in peace alone.",2,1752355590.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Much as I hated to admit it, while walking down the stairs, my robot partner was probably right in his cynicism.

He was *definitely* right, I realized, as I took in a giant tiger selling ""don't fuck with me, and you don't leave in a body bag"" 'insurance' in the center of the room with - was that a juvenile Leporidae covering his ass?

""Come on,"" the tiger growled, ""you ***know*** you want this! Come and get it!""

...and he sharpened his claws on the floor.

I ducked behind the bar, hopefully before he noticed me.

""This is bad for business!"" the Madam almost yelled into my ear, ""make it stop, and you get whatever you want,"" she told me in more sane tones.

""You can't take him?"" I asked her, because if there was one thing she was good at, it was twisting men around her little finger.

""If I could,"" she hissed, ""would I be asking you to do it? I'll write your bar tab off if you manage it.""

Now *that* was an incentive. So I did something incredibly idiotic and very human - strode out from behind the bar with both empty hands completely visible.

""Has there been a misunderstanding?"" I asked in the most innocent tones I could muster, spreading my hands out in front of - ***OH FUCK!***

The giant tiger was on me faster than I could even *try* to pull. And his damn leporidae was making it clear to the rest of the bar that if they tried interfering, they'd be getting an express ticket to whatever afterlife they believed in - or one they didn't: ""Cosmology isn't a democracy!"" is just one of the things I heard him yell, but I don't remember all of them because *I had a giant tiger all over me!*

""Why?"" the giant tiger asked me.

""My bar tab's on the line!"" I shouted at him, driving my knee up into - shit, that's where he should have been, but he'd gotten off me in a split second.

""*Now* I trust we can have a constructive conversation,"" the giant sapient tiger said, circling me like a prey animal. *Fuck him.* Humans were at the top of the food chain on our world! I threw a punch. And a kick.

Neither seemed to bite on the tiger, who just lazily redirected them aside, but the *second* punch connected, rocking bones that probably hadn't been struck in decades.

""Good!"" the tiger said, grinning - and I realized how many of its opponents must have given up in the face of that grin. A tiger's grin isn't something you want to see.

""*COME GET SOME!*"" I yelled, grabbing a chair and belting him across the face with it. Madam would probably chew me out about that, but right now there was nothing but the fight. ""***FUCK YOU!***"" I screamed as I used one of the chair's surviving legs as a club and beat that tiger ~~like my father had beaten me with jumper cables~~ to within an inch of his - then a set of claws were around my throat.

""This has been a fun way to blow off steam,"" the giant tiger said to me, ""and do *any* of you think you could do half as good as he just did?"" he asked, raking his eyes around the room.

And getting no takers.

""Cowards,"" he said, then turned back to me, ""hey, I'll buy you a cup of tea or coffee, your pick. You seem interesting to talk to.""

I'd wanted a non-chronograph titanium PO for the better part of a year, but something about the feeling of the lighter metal on both sizes just didn't do it for me, and certainly not for the $2,300 price premium. The stainless steel just feels appropriately weighted somehow.

I had also written off the larger chronograph as being too ""big"", but it's honestly the perfect size in person if you don't plan on wearing it with shirts with super tight cuffs. I live in Florida and rarely wear long sleeves anyways.

Kaelith did not want to be here.

He could be brooding. He could be exorcising spirits. He could be committing minor arson in peace. Instead, he was standing in a glowing street covered in confetti and scented oils while people sang in reverse and a balloon screamed about its taxes.

Syndra, his panther companion and agent of chaos, locked eyes with a glowing pink sign that read

The Fish Brothel. Come get slippery
where wet dreams become true



He said no. She kicked over a fruit cart and entered.

Inside, it was moist. Not damp. Moist. The cushions squelched. The walls breathed. A fish in lingerie slid past him and murmured, “You look like you haven’t emotionally processed your childhood.”

Kaelith tried to back out. A seahorse in pearls blocked the door.

“You cannot escape desire,” she said, tossing glitter at him.

He was then met with an octuous that loked at him and said""wanna see what these tentacles can do"".

Syndra sat on a chaise lounge made of regret and seaweed and began judging people out loud. “That eel is trying too hard. The crab has confidence. Oh hello, shrimp.”

A jellyfish in a leather collar floated up to Kaelith and whispered, “I want to fuse souls.”

Kaelith looked at the emergency exit. It was labeled “Nope.”

Suddenly the announcer shouted, “Welcome to the Flirt Gauntlet. Tonight’s prize is Kaelith. May the hottest fish win.”

The spotlight hit him. A dolphin played sensual flute. A pufferfish recited slam poetry about his eyes. A clam offered him legal marriage in six countries.

Then came the shrimp.

The Shrimp of Eternal Ecstasy somersaulted onto stage wearing sunglasses and lip gloss. It pointed at Kaelith and said, “You. Me. Spirit bonding. No refunds.”

Syndra bid half a meat skewer and a threat. She won. The shrimp leapt onto her head,looked at kaelith  and said, “Sup Daddy.”

Kaelith left the building through a decorative fountain.

He landed at the Door Bakery.

A cheerful baker handed him a desi pie. “It’s enlightening,” he said.

Kaelith took one bite and was immediately launched into a buttery void full of talking croissants. A baguette slapped him and screamed in French. The sky was whipped cream.

He returned covered in custard and betrayal. Syndra had taken over the bakery and renamed it Syndra’s Soul Crusts. The scones had unionized.

They arrived at the Gathering Hall next. It was full of legendary weapons and the smell of poor decisions. A sword whispered, “You cry in the shower, don’t you.”

A spear vibrated and said, “Not enough trauma. Try harder.”

Kaelith picked up a shield. It exploded in shame. A battle axe judged his fashion choices.

Syndra got in a rap battle with a possessed helmet. She won and was now legally queen of helmets. No one argued.

Next was the Café at the End.

This was Kaelith’s workplace. His sanctuary.

Wrong.

Kat, his boss, stood behind the counter holding a clipboard of passive aggression.

“You’re late,” said Kat.

“I am not on shift.”

“You exist. That counts.”

Kaelith sighed and tied his apron while a mug floated past yelling “cream me.” Syndra ordered the Emotional Damage Tart. It burst into tears and offered her its diary.

The cat—not Kat, the cat—lay on the counter blinking in morse code. It knocked over a mug. “Just like your dreams,” it whispered.

A customer asked what was in the basement.

The air dropped ten degrees.

Kat smiled too widely and said, “The past.”

They were thrown out by a swarm of caffeinated spoons.

At the Church of Miracles, Kaelith lit a candle. It screamed. Syndra lit one and began speaking fluent cheese.

A nun blessed him. He sneezed glitter and accidentally sanctified a rock.

Then they reached the Camp of the Kingdom.

A sign fluttered in the wind

> Join the Empire. Offer your balls.



A man in golden robes stepped forward. “To join, you must give everything. Your home. Your loyalty. Your balls.”

“Excuse me,” said Kaelith.

“Symbolically,” the man added. “Or literally. Depends on the package.”

Syndra knocked over the sign. It exploded into a contract and a single tear.

Kaelith burned the tent.

As night fell and the chaos finally slowed, Kaelith and Syndra sat on a mossy bench covered in cookie crumbs and trauma.

Kat approached with coffee and a list of violations.

“You ready for the tournament?” he asked.

Kaelith stared at the stars.

“I want to die. Again. But worse this time.”

The shrimp on Syndra’s head winked. “Make sure to mention me when you win.”

The café cat purred in the distance. Somewhere, the desi pie dimension wept.

The shrimp then winked at him.

Kaelith closed his eyes.


He had survived the Twilight Festival.

He would never be the same.

I'm new to FictionLab and I have some questions that hopefully you guys will be able to solve for me. Is there a a special way to word the instructions to get the A.I. to slow down instead of quickly moving the story forward? If my characters are doing something or in a particular location, I don't want them to rush through it. I want them to spend some time doing what they're doing and in the location itself until I give the indication it's time to move on. For example: if they're in a store shopping, I want them to be there looking around for a while until my character decides its time to go, not cut to them already at the register. I use the Oracle model, BTW. Any advice? 

Also, I feel like the A.I. is ignoring my character persona even though I've clicked on it numerous times to select it for the chat. Like I put that she doesn't drink coffee yet the AI still tried to give her coffee. Or that she has a chronic condition, but the AI didn't remember and thought her stomach was fine normally. Is there something wrong with it?

One more thing, is there a model that focuses more on the characters inner thoughts as opposed to their action and dialogue? I feel like it barely addresses what the characters are thinking and feeling internally. How do I fix that? Is there a specific thing I can put in the instructions?

Sorry for all the questions. Again, any help would be really appreciated. 👍🏼👍🏼

Used tinder. Had a decent amount of matches. But met one. It was the only girl i dated. 

Im 39. She 32. Pretty. University educated.Not a stunner. But classic feminie and cute. People turned heads when we held hands.

We stayed togheter for about 2 weeks before i had to return home. 

We planned to keep togeher. But many events in both our lives made it difficult. Nothing scetcy. Just life.

My experience in SEA dating is limited to this experience. But it was very good. She was always open, direct and honest. She never played any games. She was housewife keeper material. Very caring. One time i had food poisoning and was puking and shitting at the same time. She was all "" i will take care of you"". She wasent poor. Had traveld to europe. Had a job. No kids.

Can somone give me any perspective on how common this type of peronality is? Is this more common in HMC compared to hanoi? Vietnam compared to other countrys? Are there countries where girls have similar mentality?

Im tall. Athletic. I dress well. Good economy. She couldt not see those things at our first date ( drinking coffee) , and she paid her own. I was dressed like a tourist for a tour 😅

by Worthy News Washington D.C. Bureau Staff\
\
(Worthy News) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping escalation in his global tariff policy, issuing formal letters to eight more countries warning that steep import duties will take effect on August 1 unless new trade agreements are reached. The move marks the latest salvo in Trump's aggressive ""America First"" trade agenda, which he says is designed to correct decades of unfair trade practices and ballooning U.S. deficits.\
\
Speaking from the White House, Trump explained that the tariffs were determined using what he called a ""common sense"" formula: ""based on deficits, based on how we've been treated over the years, and based on raw numbers."" The letters, posted to Trump's Truth Social account, specify tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% depending on the country's trade deficit with the United States and its overall relationship with Washington.\
\
Among the newly targeted nations are Brazil, Algeria, Libya, Sri Lanka, Iraq, Brunei, Moldova, and the Philippines. The most severe penalty was reserved for Brazil, which faces a 50% tariff hike--up from 10% in April. Trump cited the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and alleged censorship of U.S. social media content as reasons for the stiffer measure.\
\
""The way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace,"" Trump wrote in a letter diverging sharply from the otherwise formulaic correspondence sent to other countries.\
\
Other nations received tariff warnings of 30% (Algeria, Libya, Sri Lanka, Iraq), 25% (Brunei, Moldova), and 20% (Philippines). The administration emphasized that these figures may change depending on each nation's willingness to engage in good-faith trade negotiations.\
\
The U.S. has now issued similar letters to 29 countries. Of those announced Wednesday, only the Philippines and Brazil rank among the top 50 U.S. trading partners. Brazil exported $49 billion in goods to the U.S. last year, including oil, beef, and coffee. The Philippines contributed $14.1 billion in electronics, auto parts, and textiles. Other nations, such as Iraq and Libya, primarily export oil, but overall volumes remain comparatively small.\
\
The tariff campaign began in April with a baseline 10% duty on all imports and higher rates on strategic targets. After a 90-day pause following stock market volatility, Trump extended the deadline to August 1 via executive order earlier this week, insisting there would be ""no extensions.""\
\
""All money will be due and payable starting August 1, 2025--No extensions will be granted,"" Trump wrote on social media, framing the deadline as firm and final.\
\
Despite the aggressive rhetoric, financial markets appeared unfazed. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9% on Wednesday to a record high, buoyed by a rally in Nvidia shares, which briefly pushed the chipmaker's market cap above $4 trillion. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones also posted gains. Analysts attributed the optimism to investor confidence that the most severe tariffs might be negotiated down before implementation.\
\
Trump also announced a new 10% tariff on imports from BRICS countries--Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa--indicating his broader strategy includes punishing nations aligned with the bloc. ""It would be simpler to institute tariffs across the board rather than negotiate individually,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on July 3.\
\
The administration estimates it has collected $120 billion in tariff revenues so far this fiscal year. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent projects that figure could rise to $300 billion by year-end, with a 10-year projection of $2.8 trillion. ""We think that's probably low,"" Bessent said during a July 8 Cabinet meeting.\
\
Though foreign countries don't pay the tariffs directly--U.S. importers do--Trump maintains that these levies create pressure on foreign governments, encourage domestic manufacturing, and generate vital revenue. Critics warn the costs are often passed on to consumers through higher prices.\
\
The European Union, while not yet among those targeted in the latest wave, is reportedly pursuing an outline deal with the U.S. ""within days or weeks"" and expects to retain a 10% baseline tariff under any final agreement. Meanwhile, Trump's team has hinted that more letters will be issued in the coming days.\
\
All Eyes on August\
\
With the August 1 deadline fast approaching, the administration is holding firm. Trump's letters suggest some room for negotiation, stating: ""These tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with your country.""\
\
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is closely monitoring the economic effects of the tariff regime. Minutes from its June meeting released Wednesday indicate Chair Jerome Powell is taking a cautious approach to cutting interest rates--despite Trump's claim that the U.S. is losing $360 billion annually due to elevated refinancing costs.\
\
As the tariff showdown escalates, Trump's message remains clear: the era of unchecked trade deficits is over, and nations must either deal--or face the consequences. \

1lyb0w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lyb0w1/does_muellerhome_dc550x_red_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does Muellerhome DC-550x Red Coffee Maker Deliver Great Value? Review Inside!,"**The Aesthetic Appeal and Design**  
The first thing that caught my eye about the Müllerhome DC-550X Red Coffee Maker is its sleek and vibrant red color. It stands out beautifully on the countertop, adding a dash of flair to my otherwise neutral kitchen decor. The compact dimensions—9.25"" x 6.9"" x 12""—make it ideal for even small kitchen spaces, which was a plus for me since counter real estate is precious. The Borosilicate glass carafe not only looks durable but is also resistant to absorbing smells, which is a vital feature for a coffee enthusiast like me, who switches between blends regularly. The design feels both practical and modern, with an easy-to-read water level window and an ergonomic carafe handle for a drip-free pour.  

**User Experience and Day-to-Day Functionality**  
For someone who loves waking up to the smell of fresh coffee, this drip coffee machine delivers an exceptional experience. I found its 12-cup capacity perfect for hosting brunch or when my energy levels demand more than one cup. The easy-grip handle felt comfortable while pouring, and I didn’t experience any annoying spills or drips. I tested its fully automatic operation on a sleepy weekday morning and found it effortless to use—the simple controls and intuitive operation really shine here.  

[Check Müllerhome DC-550X Red Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0djrn24yk/)  

**Positives**  
- Generous 12-cup capacity is suitable for large gatherings or coffee-heavy mornings.  
- Stylish and compact design fits effortlessly into smaller spaces.  
- Drip-free carafe, eliminating unnecessary mess.  
- Eco-friendly reusable filter enriches flavor while reducing waste.  

**Keep Warm & Auto Shut-Off Features**  
One feature that impressed me deeply was the Keep Warm functionality. The warming plate retains the coffee's heat for up to two hours while maintaining consistent temperature, ensuring my last cup tastes as fresh as the first. However, I particularly appreciated the automatic shut-off after two hours—it's a safety measure that ensures I won’t accidentally leave the machine on in my rush to leave the house. I tested this over a week and found it reliable every single time.  

**Reusable Eco-Filter for a Sustainable Brew**  
Sustainability matters a lot to me, so discovering the reusable filter was a game-changer. It’s easy to remove and clean, and it contributes to significantly less waste compared to disposable paper filters. Additionally, I noticed a distinct improvement in the depth and richness of the coffee’s flavor, though it still offers the flexibility to use paper filters if you prefer. Cleaning the filter wasn’t much trouble.  

**Negatives**  
- The bright red color may not appeal to those who prefer muted tones.  
- Might not brew very well for single-cup needs compared to pod machines.  

**Competing Products**  
There are plenty of alternatives, such as the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which offers pod compatibility, or the Cuisinart DCC-3200 for its programmable features. Compared to these coffee makers, the Müllerhome DC-550X focuses more on simplicity, larger capacity, and durable design, standing out in its eco-conscious filter feature and impressive heat-resistance of the glass carafe. On the other hand, the competition edges ahead in versatility and programmability, particularly for coffee drinkers who like advanced customization.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
This coffee maker justifies its investment with its combination of thoughtful features and user-friendly functionality. The reusable filter alone reduces long-term costs associated with buying disposable filters. While it’s not the cheapest in the market, its durability, design, and added features like auto shut-off make it worthwhile for families or regular coffee drinkers.

1lyb0u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1lyb0u2/am_i_wrong_for_being_upset/,Am I wrong for being upset?,"Hi Reddit,

I’m dealing with a messy situation and can’t tell if I’m being an asshole.

Background: I’m a survivor of trafficking and grew up in a cult. I recently blocked my dad and changed my phone number, which has left me in a near-constant panic attack. I told my friends I can’t be alone right now. I even took a week off work, and my close friends have been rotating “shifts” to stay with me.

Maya (my best friend of 20 years, currently unemployed) offered to stay with me 24/7, saying *“I want to be with you the whole time. You are my priority.”*

At one point, I said I’d love to go somewhere near water but was too anxious to plan it. I told Maya: *“I’ll give you my credit card. Please plan this for us. I just want to go. You, me, and my dog.”*

Maya tried looking for places, but rejected every option because they weren’t places she wanted to stay. Eventually, I said, *“You know what, never mind. I’m anxious and would rather stay home. Let’s keep this week unstressful.”* She agreed.

Later, my new friend Jake came over for his “afternoon shift.” He gently said that moving forward, I might want to create some “normal” experiences because my life has been so full of trauma. Maya *lost it*.

This was the first time Maya met Jake, and she knows I really like him. She screamed at him, saying, *“You’re a WHITE MAN, you have NO right to tell OP what to do. She just escaped her abusers and you come in here with your false sense of authority. I literally want to punch you.”*

Jake stayed calm and said, *“I hope you know we’re all on the same team and just want OP to heal. I’m sorry if I don’t always say the right thing.”* But Maya kept tearing into him for 20 minutes.

After yelling, Maya left to get coffee and cool off, and asked me to come with her, basically implying I should kick Jake out and leave with her. I decided to stay because I didn’t want to abandon Jake after how she’d treated him.

**Here’s the part I left out before:**

When Maya came back, she stormed in with Riley on speakerphone. Maya sat down on the couch **between me and Jake**, completely ignoring Jake and blocking him out of the conversation. She said:

>

I was shocked because we’d agreed not to go anywhere. I told Maya: *“This isn’t what I meant. I wanted a quiet getaway, not a trip with strangers and tons of dogs in the woods. I’m anxious and can barely leave my room right now. I don’t want to go.”*

Maya kept pushing, insisting I’d asked her to plan it and now she’d planned this. I asked for a minute alone, so she and Riley stepped outside. I had a panic attack because my whole life has been people refusing to take my “no” for an answer.

Also, I’m anxious about meeting Riley because they’re easily offended. For example, I know they’d be upset if I accidentally misgendered them, and that added more pressure.

Later that night, I texted Maya: *“I’m not changing my mind, but I don’t want to go. I’m sorry.”* She reacted with a thumbs up.

This morning, Maya showed up at my apartment unannounced with Riley and Riley’s dog. She literally pulled me out of bed and said, *“You’re coming. No choice.”*

Lila, who was there for the night shift, had to help hold my dog back from Riley’s dog, whom I’d never met. I started panicking because my whole life has been people barging in and ignoring my boundaries.

Trying to make conversation, I asked Riley if their dog was male or female. Riley got offended and said, *“Dogs don’t identify gender.”*

Maya and Riley kept insisting I *had* to come because Riley went through so much trouble planning this, and Riley has chronic illness, depression, and a strained relationship with their mom and “did all this for me.” But I never asked for this. The idea of being stuck in a cabin with strangers and multiple dogs sounds terrifying right now.

Lila stepped in and said, *“OP said NO.”*

Maya said, *“You’re my #1 priority. I’m here for you.”* Riley said they had to leave for the cabin. I thought Maya would stay with me, but instead she said, *“Love you, bye,”* and left with Riley—knowing Lila was going to work soon and I’d be alone for six hours.

I’m not a baby—I went to a coffee shop and kept busy. But I felt blindsided and abandoned.

Also, after Jake left the other day, Maya accused me of:

* liking men because of my trauma and thinking women “suck.”
* not being mad at Jake because I’m into men.
* trying to act like a “hippie white man” to impress Jake because I walked him out barefoot.
* insulting another friend for being Christian.

I feel guilty because Maya has been there for me a lot, but she also totally overstepped my boundaries, physically pulled me out of bed, ignored my “no,” and tried to guilt me into a trip I explicitly said I didn’t want.

**AITA for being mad at Maya, even though she says I asked her to plan a trip and now I’m refusing everything she tried to arrange?**",0,1752354065.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,0.25,False
1lyb0io,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1lyb0io/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

# JOIN THIS GROUP

If you want to try out #valzubiriagenda, in any capacity, join this group. Let others know about this group as well.

1lyayg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lyayg0/my_daughter_came_back_from_her_dads_house/,My daughter came back from her dad’s house different,"It’s a long shot, but maybe someone will read this before the articles. Maybe even before the police get to my house. I want someone, anyone, to know why I’m doing this. Maybe with some perspective, I’ll seem like less of a monster. I’m not a monster, I’m a mother.

Divorce is a hell of a thing.

After every scrap of evidence my lawyer and I gathered, every late night and early morning, every written testimony from everyone I knew— the stupid judge hadn’t even read them, hadn’t even looked at the photos of bruises.

Travis had taken the classes and gone to AA, and that was good enough for “your honor”.

Even though it was 50/50 custody, even though I had half, I felt like I lost it all.

I’d left him for Trinity, my 8-year-old. I did all of this to keep her safe, and now she was going to have to face him alone.

I failed her.

Explaining it to her was tough.

“But I don’t want to, Mommy!”

I sighed, petting her head gently. “I know,” I whispered. “I don’t want you to, either.”

“It’s not fair! Why do I have to?”

“Because the important man said you have to. The rules say whatever he says goes.”

“Why?”

I blinked the tears from my eyes, “because your daddy did just the right things, and the important man said that made him a good daddy.”

“But he’s a bad daddy,” she wined.

I sniffed, I didn’t like to talk badly about her father to her, but at the same time I never wanted to invalidate her. Because she was right. Travis was a bad daddy. “I know,” I wiped the tears from my eyes.

It broke my heart that she’d have to go back there without me. I can’t imagine what that’ll be like for her.

“I’m scared,” she whispered hollowly.

“I know, baby, but I’ll be right here for you when you come back,” my voice cracked with the fear and pain I felt.

Going to AA, and the abuse and parenting classes, Travis had met some new people. Awful people. People like himself.

I guess that’s why it started getting worse.

I guess that’s what started the changes.

First, she started getting quieter. Sinking into herself. The bouncy girl that sang and danced all around the house at all times, slowly became the sullen silent girl that sat in corners and spoke softly only when she needed to.

I don’t even remember when the sing-song, “mommy pass the ketchup, I need some for my smiley fries. If I don’t get some, they’ll be frowny fries!”— turned into the mumbled, “mom, can I please get the ketchup?”

It happened over the course of the year, gradually quieter and quieter.

She cut her long, beautiful hair.

She stopped wearing her favorite dresses. She said she only wanted pants when I took her shopping. Even for my sister’s wedding, she would only wear a dress if she could put her little jeans underneath.

These were just little things, but her personality was the first change I noticed.

A few weeks in to the split custody, I heard a shrill scream in the dead of night.

I bolted upright, thinking he had gotten to my baby. It took a few blinks before I realized he wasn’t here. I didn’t have to save her, I needed to comfort her.

I was at her bedside before I knew it. She flinched as I touched her. She was babbling “I won’t tell,” and “I don’t like that,” and “it hurts.”

It made me look at the bruises on her arms. A hand that had clearly grabbed too hard, with too much authority. He’d been hurting her again.

“It’s okay, honey, Mommy’s right here,” I told her frantically.

She screamed again and tucked her arms close, kicking her feet. Hot tears streaked her cheeks. “Get off of me!” She sobbed.

“Baby, it was a bad dream, it’s okay,” I soothed.

Her eyes seemed to fix on me, and she flung her arms around my neck. “Mommy, mommy, it was horrible.”

“Shh, Trinity, it’s okay,” I didn’t know what else to say to her.

She sniffled, curling herself closer. “They did something to me,” she whispered.

“What’d they do?”

“I’m not supposed to say,” she cried. “They… they put something inside of me.”

That was a lot to chew on. I mulled it over, knowing Travis had been into some pretty dark stuff. Who knows what he and his friends could’ve done to her, or have had done to her. Had they put a curse on her, or a demon in her? The idea that a malevolent spirit was feeding on my daughter both enraged and terrified me.

I prayed with her. Asking God to undo whatever Travis and done, and protect her from him doing more.

I petted her head, not knowing this was the beginning.

Next came the appetite. She started eating and eating and eating some more. It was insatiable. I saw that girl wolf down a stack of pancakes as tall as her head and neck combined.

I woke up in the middle of night to get a glass of water, and found her sitting on the floor in front of the fridge eating anything she could get her little hands on.

She started eating weird things, too. Like putting a pickle under a slice of cheese in the microwave, then eating it with a fork. Meat sticks with tartar sauce. Cottage cheese with ruffles sour cream and cheddar chips (actually that one was really good). She craved maraschino cherries the most. She ate a whole jar in one sitting.

It seemed like a growth spurt had hit her like a bus.

Trinity started maturing in other ways, too.  Growing hair, filling out in certain places, body odor.

I had thought she was a little young, but maybe she was just an early bloomer.

Then one morning, I was getting her ready for school. Packing her lunch, making sure she showered and got ready, the whole bit. When she came into the kitchen fidgeting with her shirt, I was cooking bacon. I turned to tell her something when I realized she was turning green. I began to ask her what was wrong, when she doubled over slightly and spewed rancid beige and pink puke all over me. I swore I could see the rancid acidic, fruity, fishy smell.

I gagged myself.

“Oh my god, I’m so sorry,” she panicked.

I grabbed a towel and wiped her chin where a little excess dribbled, “it’s okay. Are you sick?”

She nodded, “my tummy hurts,” she clutched it to demonstrate.

I sighed, “go lay down, I’ll call the school.”

She nodded again, solemnly, embarrassed, before shuffling off to her room.

Trinity kept throwing up, too. Every other morning she rushed to expel whatever racked her body.

It was then that I started getting suspicious.

I was frustrated I wasn’t getting any answers from Travis. Frustrated that I didn’t know how to help her.

Her face began to change. Not just as she grows, but her nose swelled up and her eyes sunk in. She started getting acne. Red dots paraded across my little girls face and sores opened from her little fingers picking them. Her hair became greasier and started falling out. Her nails became brittle. She became brittle.

Then, I started noticing her body shape. Her hips and thighs got bigger, her stomach distended, and her unmentionables swelled. Her feet and hands got so big they looked disproportionate to her body.

Trinity was changing inside and out.

She was irritable. Not regular maturing kid irritable, but something else. She had rage behind those eyes sometimes.

Once, she frisbeed a plate at my head. She picked up things she shouldn’t have been able to. She toppled our statue of Mother Mary, breaking her open beckoning hands.

I bought her a cross to wear around her neck, but she never wanted to wear it.

I sprinkled holy water in her food and she threw it up.

I put salt around the door and windows in her room and I found them dusted away.

One day, she winced in pain as she bit into a cupcake.

I squinted, trying to make sense of it. Had the cupcake hurt her? “Sweetie, come here.”

She looked worried, like she’d done something wrong.

“C’mon,” I coaxed.

She came over with her head hung low.

I gently touched her chin and lifted her head. “Open up.”

When she did I was hit with the smell of decay. All of her teeth were laced with yellow, brown, and black. There were holes in some spots, and cracks in others.

Whatever this was, she was rotting from the inside.

It was then that I called our priest about an exorcism. Father Wilkerson said these things take time, he’d have to get approval. He told me to take her to the doctor first.

So I took her to the dentist, and three extractions, seven crowns, and 18 fillings later, she was a new girl.

It was some time before I heard back from the priest. I tried to ask him about it at church, but he always told me he was still waiting.

I couldn’t wait anymore. I couldn’t sit by as my daughter was victim to some unholy spirit that tore her body and mind apart. She wasn’t my daughter anymore. She belonged to the demon now.

I cried myself to sleep often.

She woke me up with her nightmares often.

She kept just saying they put something inside of her, and I knew that Travis had put a demon inside my daughter to punish us.

This all lead up to this morning.

She woke me up early with a nightmare, and while she dozed back off I drank my coffee.

When she got up she immediately emptied what little contents she had in her stomach, loudly retching as she prayed to the porcelain god.

We prayed and ate, and she managed to keep it down.

Then she got ready to shower, and that’s when shit really hit the fan.

I heard her scream.

I ran to her, worried that some ungodly thing had gotten to her.

It had.

I burst through the door to find my daughter screaming and crying hot tears. She was naked, ready for her shower. Her hands clutched her sides as she fell back against the bathtub. “It hurts, it hurts,” she screamed. There was a mess of watery blood pooling on the floor. It ran down her legs. It was then that I saw the affliction.

Her stomach stretched and bowed and moved. There was something moving inside my baby. A little hand pressed against the elastic skin, making a distinct print.

My scream joined hers, and I rushed to her side. She grabbed my hand so hard I felt the sickening crack and pop of my weak finger bones. “Mommy, call the hospital, I’m going to die.”

“No, no, honey,” I told her. “You’re not going to die. We’re going to get this demon out of you!”

She shook her head as she cried out a string of nonsense in pain.

I reached for my phone and made two calls. I called the priest and told him to get his holy ass over here. I don’t care about approval we need this now. And I called my sister. She said she was on her way.

I moved Trinity to the dining table, figuring that would be the best place to do it.

She writhed and moaned and screamed out.

Father Wilkerson came first. He really didn’t want to without approval. He kept telling me to take her to the hospital first. But when he saw the state she was in, he decided to do some tests.

He kneeled beside her, praying with her.

Her screaming became even louder and she thrashed and banged her head on the table.

He sprinkled holy water and she flinched and howled.

“Fuck you!” Screamed my eight year old baby girl through her teeth to our priest.

He steeled himself, and rose to his feet, opening his bible. He was going to do it. He was going to free my baby.

That’s when my sister walked in.

The priest turned to see Jess approach, clutching her purse nervously.

She took one look at Trinity and began to cry. She took her hand, holding it gently.

Trinity seemed to calm down a little.

“Antie,” she wheezed, her voice hoarse from all the screaming.

“Hello, beautiful,” she whispered. “I’m gonna talk to your mommy, okay?”

She nodded, beginning to tense up as another wave of agony hit her. She screamed and Father Wilkerson began praying again.

Jess grabbed my arm harshly as she led me into the blood covered bathroom. “You need to take her to the hospital now!”

I shook my head, “no, no he put a demon in her, I know it!”

She grabbed my arms, “you take her to the hospital, or I will.”

“There is no injection against the devil,” I wailed, “this is the only way I can get my baby back!”

She slapped me, “you’re a sorry excuse for a mother,” she spat. “Come with us or don’t,” she ripped a towel off the rack to cover Trinity’s body. And I followed her into the kitchen sheepishly. If she was going, I was going with her.

I’d told her I would always be there for her, and if that means she’s stuck like this for a few more hours , than I’ll be right there with her until we can get back to the priest.

The drive was uncomfortable. I sat in the back with Trinity’s writhing body resting in my lap. She wailed and howled as the unclean spirit wracked her body.

They rushed her in right away, and she was seen in record time.

And everything changed when that doctor spoke to us.

I still hear his words echoing in my head. Even now as I clutch the pillow in my hands.

She looks so beautiful, I mused. She lay sleeping in the hospital bed. Her hair a halo around her head like the angel she really was.

I love her, and that’s why I’m doing this. Because she can’t live in a world where what the doctor said is true.

Because he told me my daughter is pregnant.",1,1752353895.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1lyaxzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lyaxzg/aitah_for_telling_my_mum_to_abandon_my_sister/,AITAH for telling my mum to abandon my sister?,"My sister Mary (19f) has always been cunning and narcissistic, when we were kids she would take advantage of the situation to use for her benefit. For example when we were 4-5 onwards she would hurt herself by biting, whacking her head or limbs on sharp or blunt objects and throwing herself down the stairs so that she could cry and tell my single mother that I did it. If I came up with evidence then my mother would punish me because she was dealing with 4 kids under 10 alone and she  couldn’t deal with bickering, I was supposed to be the responsible older sister. Or the time when my uncle died, she would cry and tell teachers and my mother she was too sad to do anything so my mother let her stay home, when I came home from school she would be laughing and told me that I should fake it too if I want to stay home. Because it was an emotional time for my mother she used it to her advantage to manipulate her and my mothers side of the family. Bare in mind she was 10 so she understood exactly what she was doing. 

If she didn’t get what she wanted she would strangle me until I went blue, she slammed my head into the corner of the coffee table several times and she attempted to throw electrical items into my bath, it was my older brother who had to protect me from her. I’m autistic so I knew I loved my family but I find it hard to understand emotions and when I do I don’t like upsetting people so I would put other peoples needs before my own, I didn’t like when my birthday or Christmas rolled around because people would spend money on me and even as a kid I didn’t think I deserved it. I loved helping people so when she wanted something she would be nice to me for like a week beforehand and when she got what she wanted she will treat everyone like someone she found at the bottom of her shoe. My dad was no help, he was irresponsible. He threw parties with us sleeping upstairs, he let us wander the streets alone before we turned 4, these were not safe areas and the area he lived in was full of drug users, alcoholics and pedophiles. I had to grow up fast because even though she was borderline sociopathic she was my sister and I loved her. So I acted like the responsible adult in bad situations and I had to stop her from running in the road from the young age of 3 or 4. 

Now that the context is out the way this is the situation. Mary got herself pregnant, the dad was irresponsible, he claims benefits because he has adhd and he brags that he lost his first and only job after slagging the boss off to the staff and how he didn’t like carrying inventory for one day. He uses his adhd as an excuse to belittle women, beat his mother and niece and cheat on Mary. They broke up and got together in secret because nobody liked the guy. We only found out she was pregnant because she told her boss she was pregnant and that boss was the brother to one of my friends, she was known to bullsh** and he asked me if it was true or bull. I called her and asked, she screamed that it was none of my business, that I was jealous, that I should kms, that it was good because she could use it to get away with saying anything because of “hormones”. I snapped and I do regret how I told her but I don’t regret telling her because told her she of all people should not have a child, she is a psychopath, she could not look after a fish (it died because she refused to feed it), a hamster (she abandoned it because it needed attention), a cat (she sold it for a take away, she didn’t change the litter, and she wanted to feed it so much that “it was too fat to move”), I told her that she would either give up, abandon it or put it in an unsafe environment because she stoped getting the attention or she cannot manipulate the situation. We didn’t talk for a while not until (no surprise) he attempted to beat her, he put a gun against my mums head and the police was called. I asked if she was ok and she still hated me but I didn’t care. Until she gave birth she was besties with my mum and more than one occasion I overheard them talking about me behind my back, I walked on eggshells because I couldn’t do anything right and when I ranted about my troubles or how she was not the only one who went through abuse from a partner, I was told her troubles were worse. I was constantly told to apologise to keep face and because she was pregnant. I told my mother in confidence that as soon as the baby is born she will act as though my mum doesn’t exist. I was yelled at and told by Mary that if I ever got pregnant that she hopes I have miscarriages or that the baby dies. I didn’t know how to process my emotions so I just became more distant from everyone. My current boyfriend was my rock through it all.

When she gave birth I wasn’t allowed to leave my bedroom unless for work, if I left she would cause trouble so that I would not have peace. I woke up every morning to her screaming at her week old baby telling him to shut the f up, his nappy (diper) was changed only when he pooed and if I ever was close enough I was deemed incompetent as she knew more about babies even though I never claimed to know more or less. She loved to make comments because my mother could not do anything to stop it or she’ll take her baby away and my mum could not see him again. After a week she was seeing her ex again, she became more rude and she lied to social workers about it and she tried to start arguments with my mum to give her an excuse to leave. She cut my mother off and refused her access her son. She posted all over her socials that my mum was stuck up, unfit, or abusive but she would contact my mother to bring her stuff. My mum told me “this once and that’s it”. It’s been several months since then and mary started making demands again my mother again. When I found out I told her to ignore mary, that no matter how much you try she would always expect more and treat her with less respect. I told her that if I was in the same situation I would throw her stuff away because she has no right to make demands if my mother helps her then she knows that she can talk to her like something she found at the bottom of her shoe and get away with it.

Like bro, where on earth is that a thing? Even in the West, where dating culture is common, people don’t walk around with legally binding “trial marriages.” And the way it’s framed in the film – as if it’s somehow more respectable than just dating – made me roll my eyes then and now. Let’s not even start on the casual alcoholism being passed off as harmless morning coffee. Ennada, whisky vaichu cornflakes ah saapiduvara pola irundhudhu.

But it got me thinking: What if instead of the weird contractual marriage, the story was about an adamant father(SPB) figure pressuring his son(Vijay) to produce an heir? That would’ve felt more culturally grounded and opened the door for a much deeper emotional arc. Imagine a Vijay stuck between modern values and traditional family expectations, trying to navigate love, autonomy, and duty in a society where “legacy” still matters more than compatibility.

And if you adapt this for today? We’ve got sugar dating, live-ins, family WhatsApp drama, career-first millennials, and Tinder bio filters that say “no smokers or mama’s boys.” Would a modern Priyamanavale be about a woman agreeing to a live-in to test the waters? Or a man wanting a child through surrogacy because he doesn’t believe in marriage? There are so many juicier ways to tackle these themes now.

So here’s the spicy question to my dear Redditers:
If Priyamanavale were made today – what would the updated premise be? And would Vijay still be carrying around a goddamn contract instead of just going to therapy?",1,1752353839.0,kollywood,5,0.67,False

So I'm thinking of upgrading my 12 year old basic Vizio TV and surround sound system. I've been playing with arrangements on a floor planning site and I think the attached virtual images make the most sense. The couch is modular so we have a lot of versatility there. There's a few drawbacks though - our amazing view out the windows wouldn't be as visible from the couch, it sort of cramps the walk to the outside door, and the TV would get direct sunlight in the mornings which I hear is bad for OLEDs. We have a UV film on the windows so maybe it would be ok? I would hate to have to put up blinds to protect the TV because I love having my coffee in the morning and watching the sunrise.

1lyavvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1lyavvc/my_friend_blatantly_chose_her_partner_over_me_in/,My friend blatantly chose her partner over me in a very hurtful way.,"Hi Reddit,

I’m dealing with a messy situation and can’t tell if I’m being an asshole.

Background: I’m a survivor of trafficking and grew up in a cult. I recently blocked my dad and changed my phone number, which has left me in a near-constant panic attack. I told my friends I can’t be alone right now. I even took a week off work, and my close friends have been rotating “shifts” to stay with me.

Maya (my best friend of 20 years, currently unemployed) offered to stay with me 24/7, saying *“I want to be with you the whole time. You are my priority.”*

At one point, I said I’d love to go somewhere near water but was too anxious to plan it. I told Maya: *“I’ll give you my credit card. Please plan this for us. I just want to go. You, me, and my dog.”*

Maya tried looking for places, but rejected every option because they weren’t places she wanted to stay. Eventually, I said, *“You know what, never mind. I’m anxious and would rather stay home. Let’s keep this week unstressful.”* She agreed.

Later, my new friend Jake came over for his “afternoon shift.” He gently said that moving forward, I might want to create some “normal” experiences because my life has been so full of trauma. Maya *lost it*.

This was the first time Maya met Jake, and she knows I really like him. She screamed at him, saying, *“You’re a WHITE MAN, you have NO right to tell OP what to do. She just escaped her abusers and you come in here with your false sense of authority. I literally want to punch you.”*

Jake stayed calm and said, *“I hope you know we’re all on the same team and just want OP to heal. I’m sorry if I don’t always say the right thing.”* But Maya kept tearing into him for 20 minutes.

After yelling, Maya left to get coffee and cool off, and asked me to come with her, basically implying I should kick Jake out and leave with her. I decided to stay because I didn’t want to abandon Jake after how she’d treated him.

**Here’s the part I left out before:**

When Maya came back, she stormed in with Riley on speakerphone. Maya sat down on the couch **between me and Jake**, completely ignoring Jake and blocking him out of the conversation. She said:

>

I was shocked because we’d agreed not to go anywhere. I told Maya: *“This isn’t what I meant. I wanted a quiet getaway, not a trip with strangers and tons of dogs in the woods. I’m anxious and can barely leave my room right now. I don’t want to go.”*

Maya kept pushing, insisting I’d asked her to plan it and now she’d planned this. I asked for a minute alone, so she and Riley stepped outside. I had a panic attack because my whole life has been people refusing to take my “no” for an answer.

Also, I’m anxious about meeting Riley because they’re easily offended. For example, I know they’d be upset if I accidentally misgendered them, and that added more pressure.

Later that night, I texted Maya: *“I’m not changing my mind, but I don’t want to go. I’m sorry.”* She reacted with a thumbs up.

This morning, Maya showed up at my apartment unannounced with Riley and Riley’s dog. She literally pulled me out of bed and said, *“You’re coming. No choice.”*

Lila, who was there for the night shift, had to help hold my dog back from Riley’s dog, whom I’d never met. I started panicking because my whole life has been people barging in and ignoring my boundaries.

Trying to make conversation, I asked Riley if their dog was male or female. Riley got offended and said, *“Dogs don’t identify gender.”*

Maya and Riley kept insisting I *had* to come because Riley went through so much trouble planning this, and Riley has chronic illness, depression, and a strained relationship with their mom and “did all this for me.” But I never asked for this. The idea of being stuck in a cabin with strangers and multiple dogs sounds terrifying right now.

Lila stepped in and said, *“OP said NO.”*

Maya said, *“You’re my #1 priority. I’m here for you.”* Riley said they had to leave for the cabin. I thought Maya would stay with me, but instead she said, *“Love you, bye,”* and left with Riley—knowing Lila was going to work soon and I’d be alone for six hours.

I’m not a baby—I went to a coffee shop and kept busy. But I felt blindsided and abandoned.

Also, after Jake left the other day, Maya accused me of:

* liking men because of my trauma and thinking women “suck.”
* not being mad at Jake because I’m into men.
* trying to act like a “hippie white man” to impress Jake because I walked him out barefoot.
* insulting another friend for being Christian.

I feel guilty because Maya has been there for me a lot, but she also totally overstepped my boundaries, physically pulled me out of bed, ignored my “no,” and tried to guilt me into a trip I explicitly said I didn’t want.

1lyav1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1lyav1m/my_endless_job_application_night_breakdown/,My “Endless Job Application Night” Breakdown,"Last Thursday I told myself I’d conquer at least ten applications before Friday morning. By 7 PM I was laying all over my desk with three browser windows, a half drinked latte, and Spotify on repeat just to drown out the panic creeping in. Every job listing seemed to demand a unique spin: one wanted a “data driven storyteller,” another craved a “startup hardened self starter,” and another insisted on “cross disciplinary collaborator.” I was swapping bullet points and fine tuning that one line about my capstone project for what felt like the thousandth time.

At 10 PM, I took stock: two apps fully polished, one in draft limbo, and a fresh wave of dread washing over me. My eyes burned from scrolling through endless corporate jargon, terms like “innovative mindset” and “growth hacking” littered every paragraph. I found myself rewriting the same sentences in slightly different ways, convincing myself that subtle tweaks to the phrasing would make recruiters care. By 1 AM, my coffee had lost its warmth twice over, and I was oscillating between staring blankly at my screen and scribbling incoherent notes on a sticky pad.

Somewhere around 2 AM, the frustration peaked. I leaned back, rubbed my temples, and muttered, “There has to be a smarter approach than this.” That’s when I started using this AI tool to send job applications on automode.

Suddenly, I had fifteen minutes of uninterrupted breathing room while the tool parsed my resume, matched me with relevant recruiters, and queued up twenty five bespoke messages that referenced each role’s specific requirements. When I came back, every email had the recruiter’s name, company highlight, and role keywords seamlessly woven into the intro. No more midnight rewrites.

By 2:30 AM I hit “send all,” closed my laptop, and actually slept for four solid hours, something I hadn’t done since finals week. I woke up at 6 AM to three recruiter replies: one asking for a portfolio link, another setting up a phone screen for next week, and a third just saying, “Impressive background, let’s chat.” It felt almost wrong how effortless it was, like I’d found the job search cheat code.

**What I want to know:**

1. Have you ever handed off part of your application process and did recruiters treat it as innovation or just avoid your emails?
2. Does firing off dozens of “personalized” messages in one go feel genuine, or does it cheapen the human connection?
3. Am I risking meaningful networking by automating outreach, or is this just how serious job hunters should be working in 2025?

I’m dealing with a messy situation and can’t tell if I’m being an asshole.

Background: I’m a survivor of trafficking and grew up in a cult. I recently blocked my dad and changed my phone number, which has left me in a near-constant panic attack. I told my friends I can’t be alone right now. I even took a week off work, and my close friends have been rotating “shifts” to stay with me.

Maya (my best friend of 20 years, currently unemployed) offered to stay with me 24/7, saying *“I want to be with you the whole time. You are my priority.”*

At one point, I said I’d love to go somewhere near water but was too anxious to plan it. I told Maya: *“I’ll give you my credit card. Please plan this for us. I just want to go. You, me, and my dog.”*

Maya tried looking for places, but rejected every option because they weren’t places she wanted to stay. Eventually, I said, *“You know what, never mind. I’m anxious and would rather stay home. Let’s keep this week unstressful.”* She agreed.

Later, my new friend Jake came over for his “afternoon shift.” He gently said that moving forward, I might want to create some “normal” experiences because my life has been so full of trauma. Maya *lost it*.

This was the first time Maya met Jake, and she knows I really like him. She screamed at him, saying, *“You’re a WHITE MAN, you have NO right to tell OP what to do. She just escaped her abusers and you come in here with your false sense of authority. I literally want to punch you.”*

Jake stayed calm and said, *“I hope you know we’re all on the same team and just want OP to heal. I’m sorry if I don’t always say the right thing.”* But Maya kept tearing into him for 20 minutes.

After yelling, Maya left to get coffee and cool off, and asked me to come with her, basically implying I should kick Jake out and leave with her. I decided to stay because I didn’t want to abandon Jake after how she’d treated him.

**Here’s the part I left out before:**

When Maya came back, she stormed in with Riley on speakerphone. Maya sat down on the couch **between me and Jake**, completely ignoring Jake and blocking him out of the conversation. She said:

>

I was shocked because we’d agreed not to go anywhere. I told Maya: *“This isn’t what I meant. I wanted a quiet getaway, not a trip with strangers and tons of dogs in the woods. I’m anxious and can barely leave my room right now. I don’t want to go.”*

Maya kept pushing, insisting I’d asked her to plan it and now she’d planned this. I asked for a minute alone, so she and Riley stepped outside. I had a panic attack because my whole life has been people refusing to take my “no” for an answer.

Also, I’m anxious about meeting Riley because they’re easily offended. For example, I know they’d be upset if I accidentally misgendered them, and that added more pressure.

Later that night, I texted Maya: *“I’m not changing my mind, but I don’t want to go. I’m sorry.”* She reacted with a thumbs up.

This morning, Maya showed up at my apartment unannounced with Riley and Riley’s dog. She literally pulled me out of bed and said, *“You’re coming. No choice.”*

Lila, who was there for the night shift, had to help hold my dog back from Riley’s dog, whom I’d never met. I started panicking because my whole life has been people barging in and ignoring my boundaries.

Trying to make conversation, I asked Riley if their dog was male or female. Riley got offended and said, *“Dogs don’t identify gender.”*

Maya and Riley kept insisting I *had* to come because Riley went through so much trouble planning this, and Riley has chronic illness, depression, and a strained relationship with their mom and “did all this for me.” But I never asked for this. The idea of being stuck in a cabin with strangers and multiple dogs sounds terrifying right now.

Lila stepped in and said, *“OP said NO.”*

Maya said, *“You’re my #1 priority. I’m here for you.”* Riley said they had to leave for the cabin. I thought Maya would stay with me, but instead she said, *“Love you, bye,”* and left with Riley—knowing Lila was going to work soon and I’d be alone for six hours.

I’m not a baby—I went to a coffee shop and kept busy. But I felt blindsided and abandoned.

Also, after Jake left the other day, Maya accused me of:

* liking men because of my trauma and thinking women “suck.”
* not being mad at Jake because I’m into men.
* trying to act like a “hippie white man” to impress Jake because I walked him out barefoot.
* insulting another friend for being Christian.

I feel guilty because Maya has been there for me a lot, but she also totally overstepped my boundaries, physically pulled me out of bed, ignored my “no,” and tried to guilt me into a trip I explicitly said I didn’t want.

1lyauf5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lyauf5,"Tbilisi, Georgia","I spent a few days in Tbilisi for the first time and loved every moment. Incredible architecture and food and the landscape is very cool with wine growing regions near by the city. We took a day trip to a small town and winery but those aren’t pictured here. There are so many old factories repurposed into new spaces that feel very well designed, the people were very well dressed especially the younger people. Most of the city is a very intimate scale so it feels very nice to explore. We stayed in the Saarbrucken Square area and could easily walk to old Tbilisi and easily explored most of the city on foot, using the subway which was my first Soviet built metro, and Bolt which is similar to uber. 

We ate at the following restaurants which were all fantastic: Kikliko, Puri Guliani, Shavi Lomi, Cafe Stamba, Honoré, Cafe Daphna. Wanted to try Pulp Coffee, Lolita, Weller, and Sol but didn’t have time. Went to Cafe Daphna twice because it was so good. 

Places worth checking out were Fabrika, Stamba Hotel, the antique bazaar on Saabrucken bridge (dry bridge market), Vake was a nice neighborhood to walk around and visit Turtle Lake via the aerial tram. The area around Marjanishvili metro station was also very historic and vibrant with lots of shopping and restaurants. 

I would strongly recommend visiting Georgia. I don’t speak Georgian or Russian and it was fairly easy to communicate. All the younger people spoke English. The whole landscape in the country is stunning and is great for hikers and wine lovers because they produce fantastic wine. I would love to go back one day. There was some civil unrest while we were there towards the end between pro Russia and pro EU factions of society, but it always felt safe walking around otherwise. Price wise it’s cheaper than the EU or US / CAN but not super cheap either, but you were getting very fresh high quality food each time. 

I wish I could post more than 20 pictures there was really unique street art and old, Soviet, and modern architecture, untouched rural villages, and more delicious food I’d have loved to share.

Trying to decide between these grinders for my setup and tasting preferences. I'll give a point form rundown, to start:

* I am located in Canada and need the grinder to be easily available for online order in Canada, without any import fees.
* I mainly drink black double shots, although will occasionally make a cortado.
* I will be using fresh, locally roasted medium to dark espresso beans. I really do not like acidic espresso. Additionally, I generally prefer a ratio of 18g / 36g.
* My machine is a Breville Bambino Plus. I have good puck prep (WDT tool, gravity distribution tool, calibrated tamper, paper filter and then puck screen) and I use the machine optimally (preheating/blank shots).
* I need the grinder to be on the quieter side. I would prefer for it to not be louder than the humming/buzzing of my Bambino Plus when pulling shots. If this isn't realistic, please provide some feedback.
* I need the grinder to be single dose; I hate the look of a huge hopper, and I will obviously be single dosing.
* I will be using RDT, so not sure if the difference between bellows/TIMEMORE's rotary knocker will matter?

Now that you all have some information about my requirements, what do y'all think? From my research, the Mignon Zero seems to fit the bill for the specific espresso roast level/in-out ratio I prefer. However, research is also telling me that the Sculptor 064S and 078S are good options as well, that are more capable with light roasts and are faster/maybe quieter?. Confuses me, because I will not be using acidic, light roast beans. With only the type of coffee I use, will either of the Sculptors actually perform better than the Mignon Zero? I would prefer not spending over double the cost of the Mignon Zero for an 078S, but am prepared to if there is generally a significant difference.

If anyone has a different grinder recommendation for single dose, QUIET!!, using medium to dark roasted espresso beans only for a setup like mine, let me know!",7,1752353593.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

I'm from a Muslim family. I was born in Europe and my parents are from India. I started dating a non-muslim guy in college and they hated me for it. They asked me nicely to leave the guy, and also yelled at me to do it several times. My older brother was on their side. Since I was still living at my parents' house during college, I never disrespected there rules. For example, I was always home around 9pm because they did not want me outside the house afterwards. Sometimes, they were so angry at me, they refused to let me eat diner or lunch when I was home. They even stole some of my scholarship money (they had access to it) because I don't deserve it since I am ""such an awful person"". Anyway, they wanted me to go to see our family in India during summer vacation but something felt fishy. I was dumb enough to accept and what I feared happened : they took my passport and told me I would never go back in Europe unless I marry some Indian guy. I was heartbroken and tried to talk some sense into them. I have friends who would find it odd not to see me come back in September as I was quite a serious student and would never skip class. Since they wouldn't listen, I contacted the embassy so they could help and I managed to find my passport and come back before them in Europe. I took all my shit, stayed at a friends house a few weeks and got a student apartment. 
I did not speak to my parents for more than a year after that incident. They tried to contact me but I blocked them. However, they are my parents and started to miss them so I contacted them. We went to get some coffee and as the day, weeks, months passed we stopped talking about the incident.
Today I have a job, a boyfriend (non Muslim again), a house, a cat, no children (we don't want any) but they still don't like it and judge me for it quite often. On a regular basis, they compare me to my brother who earns more money than me and is ""the only child that truly loves them"" and they can't talk about me to our family in India because there is ""nothing to brag about you"". What I quote is what they actually said multiple times.
I wanted to stop talking to them because I was fed up with all of that. However, my mum had cancer and it made me realise I could lose her any moment and I could not stop talking to my family (bad timing). We all had to help her. 
Her sickness did not soften her. The opposite... So now I don't know what to do. Do I just keep up with every mean stuff they tell or should I just stop and leave? ",4,1752353445.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Later, my new friend Jake came over for his “afternoon shift” to help me not be alone. He gently said that in the future, I might benefit from making new “normal” memories, because my life has been only trauma. Maya LOST it.

Jake calmly said he meant no harm, apologized, and said we’re all on the same team. But Maya kept tearing into him for 20 minutes.

Maya then said she needed to leave and get a coffee to cool off, and asked me to go with her, clearly expecting me to kick Jake out. I chose to stay because she’d been awful to Jake and I didn’t want to just ditch him. I felt guilty because it looked like I was choosing a guy over my friend, but my only reason was her behavior toward him.

After Jake left, Maya asked me if my cult and trafficking past made me think men were authority figures and women sucked, and if that’s why I’m straight and into men, and why I wasn’t mad at Jake. She also asked if I was trying to act like a hippie white man to impress Jake because I walked him out barefoot.

Later that night, I texted Maya: *“I’m not changing my mind, but I don’t want to go on any trip. I’m sorry.”* She reacted with a thumbs up.

My friend Lila was over for the night shift and had to help hold my dog back from Riley’s dog, which I didn’t know. I started panicking because my entire life has been people ignoring my no and barging in.

Then, I tried to make conversation and asked Riley if their dog was a boy or girl. Riley said, *“Dogs don’t identify gender,”* and seemed offended, which made me feel worse.

Maya and Riley kept insisting I *had* to come because Riley had arranged a trip to Riley’s mom’s cabin near a river. It would be Riley, Riley’s mom, their five dogs, Maya, me, and my dog. They said Riley has chronic illness, depression, and a strained relationship with their mom and did all this for me. But I never asked for this, and it sounded extremely stressful for me, especially with strangers and lots of dogs.

Lila stepped in and said, *“OP said NO.”*

Maya then told me: *“You are my #1 priority. I’m here for you.”* Riley said they had to leave for the cabin. I thought Maya would stay with me, but instead she said, *“Love you, bye,”* and left with Riley—knowing Lila was about to go to work and I’d be alone for six hours.

I’m not a baby—I went to a coffee shop and kept busy. But I felt blindsided and abandoned. And yes, maybe some people would say I should just go to the hospital if I’m struggling so much, but I really just wanted my friends or at least to know what to expect.

Now I’m having severe flashbacks and feeling guilty because Maya did try to help. But she also overstepped my boundaries, physically grabbed me out of bed, ignored my “no,” and pressured me to join a trip I explicitly said I didn’t want.

hi folks,


i have a rather complex situation and i'm hoping someone, somewhere on here may be able to give me a hand with.

my situation is *incredibly* complex. instead of typing this out via paragraphs i will be provide contextual reference of my ""inspiration"" in creating this post followed by bulletpointed information on me as i find this method easier to read/get thru and highlight information.

1lyanmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lyanmb/aio_for_being_hurt_by_my_friend_for_choosing_her/,AIO for being hurt by my friend for choosing her partner over me?,"Hi Reddit, I’m in a weird situation and feel like I’m losing my mind.

I’m a survivor of trafficking and grew up in a cult. I recently blocked my dad and changed my number, which has left me feeling extremely unsafe and panicky. I’m in a near-constant panic attack and have told my friends I cannot be alone right now. I even took a week off work, and my close friends have been rotating “shifts” to stay with me so I’m never alone.

Maya (my best friend of 20 years, who’s currently unemployed) offered to stay with me 24/7, telling me *“I want to be with you the whole time. You are my priority.”*

At one point, I said I’d love to go somewhere near water, but was too stressed to plan it myself. I told Maya: *“I’ll give you my credit card, please plan it for us—just you, me, and my dog. I don’t want to think about it.”*

Maya started looking at places, but kept rejecting options because they weren’t where *she* wanted to stay. Eventually, I said, *“You know what, never mind. I’m anxious and would rather stay home this week. Let’s not do a trip.”* She agreed.

Later, my new friend Jake came over for his “afternoon shift” to help me not be alone. He gently said that in the future, I might benefit from making new “normal” memories, because my life has been only trauma. Maya LOST it.

Keep in mind, this was Maya’s first time meeting Jake, and she knows I really like him. She screamed at him, saying, *“You’re a WHITE MAN, you have NO right to tell OP what to do. She just escaped her abusers and you come in with your false sense of authority. I literally want to punch you.”*

Jake calmly said he meant no harm, apologized, and said we’re all on the same team. But Maya kept tearing into him for 20 minutes.

Maya then said she needed to leave and get a coffee to cool off, and asked me to go with her, clearly expecting me to kick Jake out. I chose to stay because she’d been awful to Jake and I didn’t want to just ditch him. I felt guilty because it looked like I was choosing a guy over my friend, but my only reason was her behavior toward him.

After Jake left, Maya asked me if my cult and trafficking past made me think men were authority figures and women sucked, and if that’s why I’m straight and into men, and why I wasn’t mad at Jake. She also asked if I was trying to act like a hippie white man to impress Jake because I walked him out barefoot.

Later that night, I texted Maya: *“I’m not changing my mind, but I don’t want to go on any trip. I’m sorry.”* She reacted with a thumbs up.

This morning, Maya showed up at my apartment unannounced—with her partner Riley and Riley’s dog. She pulled me out of bed, saying, *“You’re coming. No choice.”*

My friend Lila was over for the night shift and had to help hold my dog back from Riley’s dog, which I didn’t know. I started panicking because my entire life has been people ignoring my no and barging in.

Then, I tried to make conversation and asked Riley if their dog was a boy or girl. Riley said, *“Dogs don’t identify gender,”* and seemed offended, which made me feel worse.

Maya and Riley kept insisting I *had* to come because Riley had arranged a trip to Riley’s mom’s cabin near a river. It would be Riley, Riley’s mom, their five dogs, Maya, me, and my dog. They said Riley has chronic illness, depression, and a strained relationship with their mom and did all this for me. But I never asked for this, and it sounded extremely stressful for me, especially with strangers and lots of dogs.

Lila stepped in and said, *“OP said NO.”*

Maya then told me: *“You are my #1 priority. I’m here for you.”* Riley said they had to leave for the cabin. I thought Maya would stay with me, but instead she said, *“Love you, bye,”* and left with Riley—knowing Lila was about to go to work and I’d be alone for six hours.

I’m not a baby—I went to a coffee shop and kept busy. But I felt blindsided and abandoned. And yes, maybe some people would say I should just go to the hospital if I’m struggling so much, but I really just wanted my friends or at least to know what to expect.

Now I’m having severe flashbacks and feeling guilty because Maya did try to help. But she also overstepped my boundaries, physically grabbed me out of bed, ignored my “no,” and pressured me to join a trip I explicitly said I didn’t want.

**AITA for being mad at Maya, even though she says I asked her to plan a trip and now I’m refusing everything she tried to arrange?**

1lyancj,https://i.redd.it/ymtleuue9icf1.jpeg,Vanilla flankers review 🤍,"Vanilla Ease: This is what I thought the aromatherapy lavender vanilla would smell like. (To me, that one smells very powdery.) This one smells like straight up lavender petals at first but the dry down has a bit of a gourmandish note that mellows out the strength of the lavender and makes it less punchy, yet it doesn’t smell “sweet” or sugary. A very nice clean scent that’s very fresh yet has a hint of warmth, like the transition from summer into autumn. If you’re not a lavender fan I wouldn’t blind buy but it’s still possible you might enjoy this one since it’s not quite as floral and heavy as lavender scents typically are.

Vanilla Cafe: If you’ve ever smelled Vanilla Mocha Martini…you’re in luck. This smells practically exactly like it, at least to my nose. It’s a difficult scent to describe, it smells like a rich shot of espresso topped with vanilla cream. It’s a very warm scent. I wouldn’t wear it in the summer time. It’s like Vanilla Romance if you replaced the woodsy note with a coffee note, the vanillas of the two smell very similar. They’re both very rich with a lot of depth. Vanilla Cafe is definitely a warm and sweet gourmand, without smelling “juvenile” and “fake” like many of them do. 

Overall I’m pleasantly surprised with the two, they both are pretty complex with a lot of depth and don’t smell like straight up alcohol (though I did get the creams, not the mists.)

I’m not a baby—I went to a coffee shop and kept busy. But I felt blindsided and abandoned. And yes, maybe some people would say I should just go to the hospital if I’m struggling so much, but I really just wanted my friends or at least to know what to expect.

Now I’m having severe flashbacks and feeling guilty because Maya did try to help. But she also overstepped my boundaries, physically grabbed me out of bed, ignored my “no,” and pressured me to join a trip I explicitly said I didn’t want.

**AITA for being mad at Maya, even though she says I asked her to plan a trip and now I’m refusing everything she tried to arrange?**",2,1752352725.0,AITAH,1,0.66,False

The only exceptions are to eat and to brush my teeth, and it am supposed to be aiming for 22-23 hours a day total wear.   

It has been 3 weeks and they are horrible!! I can not eat anything outside of specific times (need to be able to brush my teeth), have to rush through my meals,  I can not enjoy coffee in the morning (unless I add water to it so I can gulp it down in 5 minutes), I can not socialize with friends. (They went out the other night, I couldn't have any drink because of the retainers, so sat there having water and eventually left) My boss bought ice cream for the office - couldn't have any without risking running out of ""retainers out"" time for the day. 

I didn't realize how much life revolves around being able to eat and drink with others. Do I just have to accept that I have to give that up for the next 6 months?

I walked around Bushnell Park in the morning, light traffic, folks out walking their dogs, everything just felt calm.

1lyaf9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1lyaf9q/romantic_intimacy_feels_impossible/,Romantic Intimacy feels impossible,"So. I am sitting down with myself after smoking a cigarette and drinking a cup of coffee. And I just realized I have no idea how to have romantic intimacy! I have a good body. I am a good person. And yet I feel like there is a blockage happening. I’m 23 years old and I’ve never had a girlfriend in my entire life. Lucky? Unlucky? lol. Anyways I can’t seem to comprehend how I should go about a romantic and intimate experience with another person. It’s not that I feel uncomfortable or lack confidence. Nor is it that I have too much confidence and comfort, but that I can’t seem to understand how to go about doing this. Tinder doesn’t seem to be the right approach, which has offered up very shy young woman…that don’t even respond to my messages. Which leads me to believe that public encounters may be more profitable. And yet public encounter have only offered up young woman who are already engaged with another man, or who are simply complacent in being single. I have the sense as I am writing this that there is some sort of blockage happening mentally. Is it possible I’m not connecting the dots between being social with friends and being romantically social? Perhaps there is some sort of link there…that I’m not seeing. I wonder why I am unable to form an intimate romantic relations ship with a partner. Or could it be that there are no young woman who are looking for a romantic and intimate experience. And my search is hopeless. I am impressed that the livelihood of the this search does not bother me. Regardless it will be good to have some feedback on this.",1,1752352513.0,Life,6,1.0,False

Hyper-vigilant, she moved quickly, eyes scanning her surroundings. Footsteps echoed behind her, adding to her anxiety. They picked up pace, so she started to jog.

A man shouted, “ Wait! ”
Wincing at the sound, she took off running. Her eyes filled with tears as she sprinted home, not daring to look back.

She rushed to her room and collapsed to the floor, hyperventilating. Leona had felt this before. Lying on her back, tears streamed into her ears, it tickled, and she let out a small giggle, then sat up. With a long sigh of relief, she looked around. She was safe. She let out another audible breath, took a shower, and went to sleep.

The next morning, Leona took the same path through the park to her local coffee shop. She ordered her favorite drink and sat at a table in the corner. Digging through her bag eagerly, her heart sank.

“My journal!” she thought anxiously rifling through her belongings.

It was gone. Leona had lost her thoughts. Teary-eyed again, she sat in silence, trying to remember where she’d left it.

The door opened, and the cafe manager walked in. He saw Leona, a regular, and noticed she looked like she’d been crying. He smiled eagerly with warmth. Leona, confused by his grin, stood up to leave but returned a small smile.

He walked over and smiled again, holding something out.
“Hey, I found this at the table after you left yesterday, I tried to run after you and return it, but I think I scared you. I’m sorry about that.”

Leona looked at the journal in his hands. Her journal. The footsteps. The shouting. Her panic. Her feral instinct to just, RUN. He didn’t seem fazed. He seemed... concerned. Aughh, he’s seen me, she thought, and a wave of embarrassment and curiostity filled her chest. Her face flushed red.

“ Thank you for returning this ” she said turning toward the door to hide her expression.

“ No problem! I love having people in here, caffeinated and focused on their work ” he said tilting his head slightly, searching for her eyes. “ You’re what makes a space like this so special ”

Leona looked up, her eyes brimming but this time, with happy tears.
My work, she thought shyly. No one had ever put it like that before.

It was always Leona, why are you doodling?
Leona, come back to the conversation.
Leona, you’re wasting ink.
Leona, return to reality.

She didn’t notice she was staring right past him. Silence settled between them as he gently tried to find her gaze.“ Sorry , thank you for saying that. I am inspired when I’m here ” she said, a little too loudly, then cleared her throat and smiled.

“ I’m glad you feel safe enough here to be inspired. Please come as often as you like. I hope to see your work soon. Have a good day, Leona ” before heading to his office.

He knows my name?

Leona walked home through the park, as anxious as always but now smiling. She sat down at her dining table and began to write.She knew exactly what kind of art she wanted to offer this new friend, hopeful, friendly, and safe. ",1,1752352386.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

I want you to feel like you know me before I know you haha, also I'm good with people in india and outside of india as well!(not in a desperate way but in a ""I'd love to hear more about you"" way)

Heyy everyone, Regardless of whoever is looking this I hope that you are going through a good day! As for me I did have a pretty good day!, I went to gym and read some books, went out with my friends for a really good cup of coffee with dark chocolate. I coded something that I really thought was genius haha(check my post on indianfinancialmarkets if you want to see it!) . finally I'm gonna wrap my day up with a good movie I'm gonna watch(please suggest me some movies!)

I feel like I have to address a few red flags because of the people who have reached out to me until now, Whereas I met a lot of wonderful people, I also met a few of the people that are making me add these **red flags**.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\-Please don't reach out to me if you want **Situationship** or don't want to do LDR if we are far away, LDR here means getting to know each other before we meetup, like just a week or so, people have reached out wanting a LDR but backed off once I asked them to make it official. (after repeatedly telling me that they like me..? I want someone to be like the same way I'm being with them.)

\-I'm not a second/third wheel in a relationship nor I am a garbage truck to dump your emotional load onto me. Now sorry for being harsh but emotional load here means that information on your EX or how your EX treated you better than everyone else and how you can't go back to him, I'm not just a guy whom you can be emotional with and cut me off once you feel better.

\-Third thing, the pics I keep in my profile are my average one's I keep the really good one's in my phone because while I believe that looks matter, one should check for emotional compatibility as well. Hence the reason why I keep average photos for my profile and keep the really good one's in my phone.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine this usual scenario......you ever see posts/reels in Instagram/TikTok and wonder when do I get someone who's sweet, caring, possibly confident(definitely haha) and a guy who will be honest if the situation comes up? 

just like I have told you in the post, I'm a big fan of life, I love adventures, spontaneous trips or just cuddling in the bed while watching Netflix, I'm mature enough to give you your personal space and support you at times where you need me the most and immature enough to do fight water gun battles with you lol(I will win haha).

I have lot planned in life, financial wise, I pretty much figured out my life and intellectually I feel like I'm smart enough to overcome situations, whereas both of them are good for me, I also want some unpredictability, some fun and someone whom I can call whenever I want, play any kind of game I want(planning to buy PS5, a laptop guy now) and honestly....wake up but still pretend to fall asleep for a few mins so that I can snuggle with you. 

I like to watch sports, anime and Hollywood moves and K-dramas so that I can practice my rizz on you hehe(so dumb!) 

**Some of my hobbies:** I play badminton, piano, music, games, I love tinkering with projects and stuff, currently working as a citizen scientist part time, I love to explore new places/long drives, vacations. I like hiking and When I am tired I mostly do Netflix and chill. Cook something new or just learn something new. I like brainy stuff such as stargazing and physical ones such as paragliding, surfing and many more!

I don't really mind the ages or anything like that and if in the off chance that I do get lucky, maybe we can start from LDR and end at ""I do""? hahaha

If you made it until the end thank you :) I'll let you on a little secret before you go!

We are flying in to Liberia at the beginning of December and would appreciate any feedback on our itinerary!

  
Day 1: 

* Fly in to Liberia airport, pick up our rental car, and drive over to La Fortuna
* Recommendations would be great for activities/restaurants in La Fortuna for the evening! We don't want to spend our evening at our accommodation, and will likely go wander around.

Day 2:

* Arenal Volcano hike
* La Fortuna waterfall
* El Salto - Rio Fortuna

Day 3: 

* Mistico Park
* Hot Springs (anything low cost would be preferred)
* Not sure yet on what else to fill this day with!

Day 4: 

* Leave La Fortuna and drive down to our accommodation in Monteverde
* 100% Aventura

Day 5:

* Monteverde Cloud Reserve
* Not sure yet on what else to fill this day with!

Day 6: 

* Leave Monteverde and drive to our accommodation in Playa Hermosa
* Not sure yet on what else to fill this day with!

Day 7:

* Rincon De La Vieja
* Oropendola Waterfall
* Rio Negro Hot Springs
* Sendero Rinconcito

Day 8: 

* Beach day! 

Day 9: 

* Back to Liberia to fly home

  
This it still quite bare, but I think a good jumping off point. We would definitely love to throw in a coffee/chocolate tour at some point. We would love to spend day 6 & 8 doing beach activities (swimming, snorkeling, boat rides, etc).

The more I think about it, the more I really like the term “partner” for what I’m looking for and when straight people use it, it helps normalize the term which makes life a little easier for my LGBTQ+ peeps, so I’m going with it. Which is to say that I am a cishet male looking for a cis woman.

This is me in Professor Kukui cosplay plus a gym selfie if I did this thing right: https://imgur.com/a/qhxvjqo

About me: I am a librarian working in Texas but looking to move away. I have no girlfriend, wife, or children to worry about, so I’m free to move wherever makes the most sense for me. I joke that there are three pillars to my personality: Pokemon, soccer, and ASOIAF. They are by far the things that I enjoy most but I have a lot of interests. Im a bit of a creative dilettante; I enjoy singing, acting, writing, composing, podcasting and have recently taken up drawing though I’m not very good at it. I speak English and Spanish fluently and am starting to move beyond “elementary” level in French. I am also learning Irish and Japanese, but I am in absolute baby-language with those. I’m a big reader and lately I’ve gotten into nonfiction science books, but I’m not above popular stuff. I relatively recently read the first ACOTAR book and Fourth Wing and liked both of them fine though I must admit I have basically no desire to keep reading them 😅. 

I am a vegetarian so I cook a bit bc I live in small town Texas lol. I also workout five to six times a week, I love coffee and have a bit of an aesthetic eye so I really like fashion. I wouldn’t say I’m like “into” fashion, but I dress well. My style is somewhere at the intersection of 1950s slacks and suspenders type stuff, dark academia style, mixed with my own personal preference for modernity. But don’t get me wrong- I’m just as likely to wear a t-shirt and jeans lol. The part that’s hard to get past for some people is that I really like jazz/swing music and swing dancing lol… I’m not great at it, but it’s very old time-y so there aren’t many people who’ve heard or can even pretend to be interested in the music I listen to. Im very into the 1950s aesthetic in particular, but don’t get me wrong; I am very progressive. I can look like a tradhusband (is that a thing? I only ever see tradwife) but still support my LGBTQ+ and BIPOC kin. 

I’m financially stable but I’m nowhere near being able to support you, though the kind of woman I’m looking for probably wouldn’t want me to support her anyhow. I’ve lifted or am in the process of lifting myself out of generational poverty depending on how you define that. My mom is my hero; she came to the USA penniless and now helps train phlebotomists all across the country. It’s bc of her that I was able to make the most of my opportunities… or at least some of them lol.

About you: I don’t know! I don’t like trying to dictate what the world around me looks like. Besides being a futile effort, I like the whimsy of finding out who is out there and might enjoy getting to know someone like me. Of course, I’d have to be attracted to you, you’d have to be attracted to me and we’d have to be compatible in all the adult ways- that’s non-negotiable, but if you are very different from me but still found this intriguing, I’d love to know why and get to know you as well. Maybe we’ll hit it off, maybe one of us will ghost the other, maybe we’ll like each other just fine but there’s no real chemistry. Whatever happens, I appreciate you reading my little stream of consciousness post and hope you find someone you enjoy.

- On the subject of the sandwich, Michel says that her one desire when in LA is to go for sushi. Bullshit that the only way the could kill time at Honor Bar was for him to order the sandwich. He was purposefully choosing to not have what she wanted.

-  Why was she at his business meeting? Lol her saying he was going to “show” his album.

- Her smile was so forced the whole time. 

- She is full of shit about her financial concerns. Her spending on coffee/matcha and gluten free baked goods alone is ridiculous. Door dashing a matcha to the business meeting??

It wasn’t work I ever set out to do - I sort of stumbled into it and I didn’t expect to  enjoy it but I ended up loving it and caring a lot about the teens in the program. I left the about a year ago, and many of the teens who had been in the program graduated that same year and went off to college. 

I’ve always been a very socially awkward person.
I do okay in structured environments, like work, where there is some sort of formal structure. On my own, I sort of struggle to connect with others. 

I was always very careful my boundaries with the teens I worked with - like the teens never had my personal phone number, don’t follow them on social media, never be one on one with them, etc. I wanted to model how safe adults should behave with teens (cause not all adults are safe). 

Some of the teens, who are now young adults, who were in my program are home from college and working their local summer jobs. 

 I bumped into two of them and they asked me to meet them for coffee and just catch up. 

I never really asked them many personal questions when they were in my program - we largely focused on the activities of the program. I always worried if I asked about their friends/romantic partners/families, it would come off wrong. I didn’t want to accidentally overstep a boundary with these teens. 

Now they are adults and interested in having continued contact with me - which I love. I still have contact with a few teachers and other adults who supported me as a teen. 

I just don’t know how to build the connection outside of the structure of a program and I also don’t want them to feel obligated to talk to me. The way I like to think of it is that I wish I had a role kind of like an aunt - I want to be an older person in their lives who cares about them but is also not a parent/boss/coach.

I’m meeting a few of them for coffee later. This was a long post to ask for suggestions of questions I should ask them and advice on how to build friendship (for lack of a better word) with these amazing young people that doesn’t feel burdensome or weird to them.

I owe this Reddit community a big THANK YOU, and I’d like to give back by sharing what worked for me. Hopefully, this helps anyone still working toward passing the PE exam.

https://preview.redd.it/9ok7poaw2icf1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7bd06d5c391690422a7a094d4e0fc7bf6e5cf6a

# 🛠️ Preparation

# 1.  PE Prep Courses

For my first two attempts, I used School of PE On-Demand, back when the exam followed the pre-April 2024 format with separate Breadth and Depth sections. For my third (and successful) attempt, I switched to PPI Live Lecture.

My honest take: I didn’t really like either course. The only part I found truly useful was the Test Bank. For Structural, the lectures mainly help with concepts. If you’re a first-time test-taker, the lectures can help you review school material and introduce topics you might not have learned (like masonry, timber, temporary structures, and construction topics).

But for retakers, I recommend spending most of your time doing practice problems. Only revisit lectures for topics you feel weak in.

# 2. Review as You Practice Problems

I blocked out two months and solved roughly 700 questions from three main sources.

# 📅 First Month – Focus: Weak Topics & Medium/Hard Problems

* ***Review Material: PPI PE Civil Structural Review Manual by Christopher Mattison, PE, SE (2025 edition)*** I like this book because it’s organized by NCEES topics. For example, section A: Horizontal Members includes beams, slabs, diaphragms, and struts across all materials — steel, concrete, masonry, and timber. ➤ Tip: Only read the sections where you’re weak while solving problems. If you buy a 1-month PPI Test Bank subscription, this book is included.
* ***Practice Books: 1. The Essential Guide to Passing the Structural Civil PE Exam – by Jacob Petro*** This book has very challenging questions — some problems took me over an hour — but it’s worth it. The difficulty forces you to dive deeper into each topic. When working through each problem, treat it like a homework assignment:
   * Topic: What is the topic? (e.g., deep foundation, concrete beam)
   * Reference: Where is it in the NCEES Handbook or design codes? (e.g., ACI, AISC, ASCE 7-16)
   * Ask: What is the question asking? (e.g., find moment, shear, stress, wind pressure)
   * Solution: Show full step-by-step work. Include code references and sketches (e.g., FBDs).
   * Note: Write a takeaway or mistake summary for each problem.
* ***2. PPI Test Bank (\~331 questions) I subscribed for one month.*** The test bank includes review materials and organized practice questions. I did 10 questions per topic at a time, using the “Show solution as I go” mode to learn actively.
* Templates I Used: I created a Word/PDF template for solving each problem step-by-step. This helped me learn to analyze questions effectively — even when I’d never seen them before — by narrowing down the relevant topic and code. I also made an Excel tracker to:
   * Record all questions I solved
   * Categorize by topic
   * Highlight topics I was weak in for review (lecture slides or PPI book)
* (I’ll share both templates at the end of this post.)
* Geotechnical Reminder: You’ll see 10+ Geotech-related questions on the exam. I used ChatGPT to help break down NCEES Handbook Sections 3.1–3.10. Must-know topics: Retaining Walls, Shallow Foundations, Deep Foundations.

# 📅 Final Month – Focus: Medium/Easy Problems, Timing, & Code Familiarity

* ***School of PE Quiz Bank (\~247 questions):*** I found these questions close to actual exam difficulty. They’re labeled Easy–Medium–Hard. I aimed to complete as many as possible.
* ***NCEES Practice Exam***: Save this for the last two weekends before your test. Use it only to get familiar with exam format — not as your main study source.
* Time Management: I didn’t do a full 8-hour mock exam. Instead, I timed myself per question: max 10 minutes per question. ➤ If a question took longer than 10 minutes, I asked myself:
   * Is it too hard?
   * Or am I just too slow because I don’t fully understand the topic? If it was the latter, I reviewed that topic. Remember: ***“You’re slow because you don’t fully understand the concept.”***
* Getting Familiar with Codes: This is a common Reddit tip — here’s how I practiced:
   * Manually bookmarked PDF codes myself (rather than using pre-made bookmarks).
   * At the end of Petro and PPI books both show which chapters of each code to focus on.
   * When solving practice problems, I try to manually find sections in the PDF — no keyword search.
   * Learn to match keywords to codes, for example:
      * “Building” → IBC
      * “Concrete beam” → ACI Ch. 9 or 22
      * “Steel column” → AISC Part 4 or 16
      * “Foundation” → NCEES Handbook Ch. 3 or IBC
      * “Loads / Wind / Live” → ASCE 7-16
      * “Bridge” → AASHTO
      * “Lumber / Wood” → NDS / ADS

If you follow the practice template I mentioned above, you’ll naturally get better at code searching. On exam day, even if you see a question you’ve never seen before (and you will), at least you’ll know where to look.

# 🧪 Exam Day Tips

* Use the full tutorial time to get familiar with the interface. ➤ The drawing feature is great for tracking rows in large tables (AISC, NDS, etc.)
* Scratch Paper: Turn the paper landscape and split it in half — so when you move to the next page, you can still see previous work.
* Quick scan first: Don’t panic if you see questions you don’t recognize. Quickly flag and move on. Many answers are hidden in the codes.
* Easy Questions: Read carefully. These questions often have small tricks. Don’t make careless mistakes.
* Follow this analysis approach: Topic → Reference → Keywords → Code → What’s given? → What’s missing? → What’s being asked?
* Morning Section: Heavier on calculations and concept questions.
* Afternoon Section: More code-based and design-focused, with lighter calculations. I got more questions on foundation and retaining walls. I even had two wood connection questions — so yes, they test everything.
* Conceptual Questions: Use elimination! It works.
* During Break: Eat even if you’re not hungry. Sit in your car, play brain-boosting music, relax your eyes. Don’t study. Don’t look at your phone. Wash your face, have coffee or an energy drink if needed.

# 🎯 Final Thoughts

This exam doesn’t define your worth as an engineer. You just have to pass it.

Take care of yourself — physically and mentally. Don’t burn out. Keep showing up and improving. You can do it.

I'll be traveling to London this winter/early spring for the 4th time! I'm looking for advice on what I can do there that isn't touristy, as I've done all the tourist stuff already and then some. I'm looking to have a more chill holiday, think casual strolls, shopping at unique/independent shops, thrifting, finding good coffee shops to read in, breakfast/lunch/dinner spots that aren't on every list of places to eat when in London (trust I've been to those places too! hahaha), a bakery that has to-die-for pastries, I think you get the point...

I have on my list the Barbican which I've never been to, and other places that I've been to and loved previously like Choosing Keeping for unique stationary, a couple of restaurants in Chinatown, going to Daunt Books, (my favorite) Broadway market (more advice on things to do like Broadway Market please, but not Borough Market as I've been there plenty!). Generally if it can be found by googling ""unique things to do in London"" I've done it, so I'm looking for more local stuff to do.

I want to explore more neighborhoods too like last time I went to Victoria Park and we walked around the neighborhoods and came across a great restaurant. Or there was this random coffee shop I ran across one day when I was in Shoreditch that I can never remember the name or location of \*EDITING to say I found the coffee shop; Paper &Cup, so I'm looking for recommendations like that. Places off the beaten path, a cute street with interesting homes or shops or a great coffee.

I also want to visit Southbank and South London more so any recommendations on that would be appreciated!

BTW I'm not an influencer, or trying to blow up any local spots! I'm just looking for new and interesting things to do as I love visiting the City, if it makes you feel better to protect your local spots you can dm me.
