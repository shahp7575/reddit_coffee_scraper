I'm not really looking to date, but have been pulling myself up and back out into the world. As such, a couple months ago I started going to a ballroom dance group as it ticked both the ""*be more social*"" and ""*way outside my comfort zone*"" boxes.

One of the members of the group gives me the ""warm & fuzzy"" vibes, and the couple times we've talked has been engaged and generous in the conversation, and told me that she is a single parent, too. But we've literally only talked a couple times and the group will soon be taking a hiatus for the summer (it's sponsored by the local university). I would like to see if she would be interested in getting coffee together, but I've spent the past few years locked inside myself and my social skills are, frankly, quite rusty.

I worry about coming across as too forward or moving a potential friendship along too fast. She's likely moving to another city later this year, so maybe that unavailability is making me feel safer to entertain the idea of spending some time together? ...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Choosing the Right Cut of Boneless Ribs

Before diving into the cooking process, it's essential to select high-quality boneless ribs to set yourself up for tender, flavorful results. Boneless ribs typically come from pork shoulders or beef chuck, well-marbled with fat, which keeps the meat juicy and rich in flavor during cooking. Look for ribs with a good balance of lean meat and fat, avoiding overly lean cuts, as fat plays a crucial role in moisture and taste.

### Preparing the Boneless Ribs for Cooking

Preparation is key to bring out the best flavors in boneless ribs. Start by patting the ribs dry with paper towels to ensure the seasoning sticks properly. Next, create a simple but effective dry rub. Combine ingredients like smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, brown sugar, salt, pepper, and a hint of cayenne for some mild heat. This rub enhances the meat's natural taste and forms a delicious crust when cooked.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-to-cook-boneless-ribs  
  
Massage the rub evenly all over the ribs, covering every surface. For the best flavor penetration, wrap the seasoned ribs in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight if time allows. This marinading step allows the spices to seep deep into the meat, resulting in a more flavorful bite.

### Cooking Methods for Boneless Ribs

The best way to cook boneless ribs combines slow, low heat and moisture to break down connective tissues, making the ribs tender without drying them out. Here are some top methods:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-to-cook-boneless-ribs  
  
- **Oven Slow Roasting:** Preheat your oven to 275°F (135°C). Place the ribs on a wire rack set over a baking sheet to allow air circulation. Cover the ribs tightly with aluminum foil to lock in moisture. Cook for 3 to 4 hours, depending on the thickness. During the last 30 minutes, remove the foil and brush your favorite barbecue sauce over the ribs, then finish cooking uncovered to let the sauce caramelize.
- **Slow Cooker:** Slow cookers are perfect for boneless ribs thanks to their gentle, even heat. Add your seasoned ribs and a bit of your favorite barbecue sauce or broth to the pot. Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours or until the meat is fall-apart tender. This method requires minimal attention, making it great for busy days.
- **Grilling with a Two-Zone Fire:** Pre-cook in the oven or slow cooker first to tenderize the ribs. Then finish them on a grill over direct high heat for 5 to 10 minutes. This adds a smoky char and caramelization that elevates the flavor and texture.
- **Instant Pot Pressure Cooking:** For a faster option without sacrificing tenderness, use an Instant Pot or other pressure cooker. Place the ribs inside with a cup of liquid like broth or barbecue sauce. Cook on high pressure for around 30 to 35 minutes, followed by a natural release. You can then broil or grill quickly for a caramelized finish.

### Tips for Ensuring Tender, Flavorful Results

Success with boneless ribs comes down to a few important details:

- **Low and Slow Is Key:** Avoid high heat for long periods, as this can dry out the ribs. Slow cooking breaks down tough fibers and results in mouthwatering tenderness.
- **Don't Skip Resting:** After cooking, let the ribs rest for 10 to 15 minutes. This allows juices to redistribute throughout the meat, keeping each bite moist.
- **Use a Meat Thermometer:** Aim for an internal temperature of around 190°F to 205°F (88°C to 96°C). This range ensures the connective tissue melts and softens, making the ribs tender without overcooking.
- **Customize Your Sauce:** Whether you prefer classic smoky barbecue, spicy kick, or a tangy glaze, apply sauce towards the end of cooking or as a finishing touch to avoid burning sugars.

### Serving Suggestions for Boneless Ribs

Pair your perfectly cooked boneless ribs with sides that complement their rich flavor. Classic options include creamy coleslaw, baked beans, cornbread, or roasted vegetables. For a lighter touch, serve with a fresh green salad or grilled corn on the cob. Don’t forget to have extra barbecue sauce on hand for dipping!

By following these steps and tips, you’ll discover the best way to cook boneless ribs that deliver both tenderness and bold flavor every time. Whether you’re cooking for a family dinner or hosting a barbecue party, these ribs will be the highlight of your meal.

Essential Tips and Techniques to Enhance the Taste and Texture of Boneless Ribs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Choosing the Right Cut and Preparing Boneless Ribs

Before diving into cooking, selecting the ideal boneless ribs is crucial for achieving a great taste and texture. Opt for pork ribs with a good amount of marbling, as fat keeps the meat tender and flavorful during cooking. Baby back ribs or St. Louis-style ribs are popular choices that work well boneless too, especially when trimmed properly to remove excess fat or silverskin.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-to-cook-boneless-ribs  
  
Preparing the ribs with a dry rub or marinade enhances flavor and helps tenderize the meat. For the best results, apply a dry spice rub containing salt, brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, and pepper. Let the ribs rest after seasoning, preferably for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight in the refrigerator. This resting time allows the spices to penetrate deeply, ensuring every bite bursts with rich flavor.

### Cooking Techniques to Improve Taste and Texture

Achieving tender, juicy boneless ribs depends largely on the cooking method and temperature control. Below are proven techniques designed to elevate your cooking game:

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-to-cook-boneless-ribs  
  
#### Slow and Low Oven Cooking

One of the best ways to cook boneless ribs is in the oven at a low temperature for several hours. Slow roasting at around 275°F (135°C) tenderizes the meat without drying it out. Wrap the ribs in aluminum foil to lock in moisture, and consider placing a dish of water or apple juice in the oven to maintain humidity.

Cooking time generally ranges between 2.5 to 3.5 hours depending on the thickness. Check early for tenderness by gently testing if the ribs are pull-apart soft. Avoid rushing this process by turning up the heat—it can lead to tougher meat.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-to-cook-boneless-ribs  
  
#### Smoking for Deep Flavor

If you want smoky richness, smoking boneless ribs is a fantastic option. Use wood chips like hickory, apple, or cherry to complement the pork. Maintain a consistent low temperature between 225°F and 250°F (107°C to 121°C).

Smoke for about 3 hours, wrapping the ribs in foil midway through to retain juices. The smoke infuses unique flavor while the gentle heat melts connective tissues, resulting in the perfect tender bite you crave.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-to-cook-boneless-ribs  
  
#### Grilling with Two-Zone Heat

Grilling boneless ribs is a quick and flavorful alternative but needs careful temperature management. Set up a two-zone fire on your grill—one side hot for searing, the other cool for indirect cooking.

Start by searing ribs over direct heat to create a tasty crust. Then move them to indirect heat, cover the grill, and cook slowly until tender, which usually takes 30 to 45 minutes depending on thickness. This method locks in juices and adds a delicious charred taste.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-to-cook-boneless-ribs  
  
### Enhancing Flavor with Sauces and Finishing Touches

To maximize flavor, baste your boneless ribs during cooking with your favorite barbecue sauce or glaze. Sweet, tangy sauces with molasses, honey, or vinegar balance the savory meat beautifully.

Apply sauce layers in the last 20 minutes of cooking to prevent burning and ensure a sticky finish. For a twist, consider glazing with a mixture of mustard and brown sugar or a spicy chipotle barbecue sauce for bold complexity.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-to-cook-boneless-ribs  
  
After cooking, allow the ribs to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Resting lets juices redistribute so the meat stays moist instead of leaking out when cut. Slice thinly across the grain for the most tender bite.

### Additional Tips to Perfect Your Boneless Ribs

- **Brining:** Soaking ribs in a saltwater brine for a few hours before seasoning helps retain moisture and infuses additional flavor.
- **Injection Marinades:** Use a meat injector to get marinade deep into thick cuts for juicy results.
- **Using a Meat Thermometer:** Aim for an internal temperature of 190°F to 203°F (88°C to 95°C) to ensure tenderness without dryness.
- **Resting After Cooking:** Always rest your ribs before slicing to keep them juicy.
- **Experimenting with Rubs:** Try different rubs that include cumin, coriander, chili powder, or even coffee grounds for unique flavors.

Mastering these steps will give you tender, flavorful boneless ribs every time. Whether you choose oven roasting, smoking, or grilling, patience and attention to detail are key. Following these essential tips and techniques ensures your boneless ribs will be moist, delicious, and a crowd-pleaser at any meal.

### Conclusion

Mastering the best way to cook boneless ribs means you can enjoy tender, juicy, and flavorful meat every time. By following a clear step-by-step guide, you take the guesswork out of the process and allow the ribs to reach their full potential. Whether you’re slow-cooking, baking, or grilling, using the right temperature and cooking time is key to breaking down the meat for that perfect tenderness.

1k4x5no,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1k4x5no/i_think_im_done_buying/,I think I’m done buying,"TLDR: Communication amongst buyers and sellers are deteriorating and it bums me out. I think buyers need to learn some respect and only reach out if you’re serious, and I think sellers need to open communications a bit more and remember that respect goes two ways. Please stop wasting everyone’s time we’re all here to have fun

Let me start by saying I’m not putting any one group down I just wanted to whine a little bit. I’ve only seen one or two other post touching on this a couple months ago, but I’d just like to hear some other opinions from fellow buyers and sellers. 

Long story short in recent months I feel like the content creation space has become really unsafe and hostile. With the uptick of scammers on both sides and seemingly the loss of respect and manners too, it all definitely makes me want to take a step back. I’ve been buying mainly feet related content for about 2 years now, and in my experience working with these creators have been mostly pleasant. Of course there’s been a couple scammers and people who disappear after one photo, but I think a lot of people nowadays are confusing the two. 

Honestly I think my biggest complaint is just the lack of communication. I understand that we don’t live life on our phones, like maybe you got caught in traffic or now you can’t film until the next day, I get it trust me I do. But I’m sorry is it too much to ask for an update? I really don’t mind paying in advance or waiting patiently until you finally have time, it’d just be nice to know that I’m still talking to someone on the other end you know? I’ve had multiple experiences in the past 6 months where I reach out to a creator, we chat for a bit and I either pay then or pay when told.. then crickets! I typically follow up the next day but I feel like the response time has become longer and longer. Sometimes we’re discussing the order and I swear almost every time I get a “I’m setting up now” or “be ready any second” then radio silence. Again if something came up that’s totally fine, that’s all you have to say! I promise you those three words will go a long way. Again let me reiterate I’m not saying that every time I text a creator they should just drop everything and focus on me. I’d just like to see a bit more care keeping those good paying customers around. you don’t have to have full convos either but a simple “thank you I hope you enjoy” would be nice. a lot of creators I’ve interacted with tend to ask if everything they sent was accurate and if it all came through. Another simple phrase that will build trust over time. 

I think what hurts the most though is becoming a regular buyer, building a nice relationship with a creator and still being ignored. I know some people are into that but it seems like no matter how much money I send or how respectful I am I’m still just a foot boy to them. And I’m not asking for a prize or special treatment, I’m also just a person not a paycheck. I love spending my time and money on people who respect the interactions between us, the boundaries set, and most importantly the person on both ends. It takes a lot of courage and even more resources to start this journey. I have endless respect for any person brave enough to dip their toes (lol) into these communities, just don’t forget that we are a community. 

The landscape is hostile and I’m sure it’s just as hard finding a secure buyer, but finding and holding on to the good eggs can lead to you finding and building your own little community. Especially recently I’ve seen long term content creators move platforms to host a nicer, safer place for buyers and sellers to interact. I definitely see this as a step in the right direction and it shows me that the people organizing things like this care a bit more than other creators. 

Again, this wasn’t supposed to be a diss post and it wasn’t my intention to bash any creators I’m just curious if anyone else is feeling this way? I’ll definitely be taking a step back from buying content but I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on both sides. More complaints?, new solutions?, or even just words, feel free to discuss. Thank you for listening to me whine.

**A couple misc. thoughts and comments I didn’t know where to mention:**

As a buyer: how important is that interaction between you and a creator? Sometimes they’re a bit abrasive but everything else is perfect. Also do quick responses like “thanks” or “that’s sweet” rub you the wrong way? Typically they don’t but recently I feel like they’re just copy and pasted.

As a buyer: if you’re working on a deal with a creator and they go quiet, how does it make you feel? I’ve waited for a week and a half for a response after asking to choose a pair of shoes. 

As a buyer: when do you typically pay? I almost always pay before hand, unless we have another deal or sometimes they send before I can lol. But as a customer sending that first half or even full price also goes a long way. Just be careful sometimes you’ll never see that money again 

As a buyer: if you’re waiting on a response and see them interacting with other customers, do you text again? Sometimes a post from a creator pops up on my feed or I’m reading comments and they’re there, but they still haven’t opened my message. Would you try reaching out again?

As a buyer: if the content you received wasn’t what you asked for or you feel like you paid more than what was sent, do you let them know? Typically I’m not too upset unless it’s a very specific request, but I’ve paid triple digits just to get two photos in return. How would you go about that?

As a buyer: if you send a “gift” for example, some money for coffee, or just a big spend out of the blue. Do you expect something in return? I love spoiling from behind the scenes sometimes but maybe after the 3rd or 4th gift a quick little pic would be nice.

As a seller: vice versa! If you receive a gift from customer, do you feel like you should send something back? Or do kind words do the job? Honestly a heartfelt thank you message is always better than a couple pics.

As a seller: when a customer disappears how does it make you feel? I know a looot of buyers need to work on their communication first, but if one is in and out how does it affect your working relationship?

As a seller: if a buyer is a little too friendly or chatty does that scare you off? I know some creators enjoy chatting and others are right to the point, would just like to know how y’all feel.

As a seller: would you rather reach out first or have the buyer reach out? For first time interactions it kinda depends, but if you have an established buyer that you’ve worked with before how likely are you to reach out?

As a seller: is money really everything? I get it almost everyone is selling for some extra cash, but man sometimes it’s not even a transactional thing I just get told over and over again to keep sending more.

I played it on an old metal Lenovo laptop back in 2014-2015, I was about 5-6 at the time but the game is still on my mind many years later.

I remember playing on the laptop in the living room, sitting on the ground with it on the coffee table while my parents were watching TV. I was going through some random online browser game website, one of those ones with flashy and colorful games in little tiny icons.

I seen this one that stood out because it was basically the only one without color. I clicked on it, I don't remember at all what it was called or any other details.

I start playing the game and it just looks pretty abstract, this weird spikey ground, nothing but black and various shades of grey and my character was like a blobby black inky cat. started with a brief introduction to the controls, my character starts falling as I move it and I guide my way through the first level, then the next one hits, I do the same but I keep dying on these spikey plant bush things, I eventually stop playing because it was basically impossible to play with 5 year old skill, so I just close it and go back to some other games.

There is something so important about this game that my brain just won't let me forget, I try researching anything about it, and I just can't. Here's some stuff that I found out myself and remembered:

1. The game was Naught, a side-scrolling game where you rotate the landscape to make your character fall through tunnels, the first game being made for iOS and Android, with a sequel that was published in 2015 for PC, Xbox, PS4, and later Switch.

2. This game was not Naught 1, nor Naught 2. It has the exact same first tutorial level as Naught 2, but the same abstract/simplistic graphics as Naught 1. It was some weird mix between them.

3. The game was browser-based, possibly made in the rising HTML5 or the dying Adobe Flash. 

4. Naught (As far as my knowledge, please correct me) has never had a web version officially created nor endorsed.

5. It was not a dream. I'm saying this ahead of time because people love to say things don't exist here, this was a real game that I vividly remember playing.



What do I think it was? I'm not sure exactly but my best bet is that it was some weird leaked prototype of Naught 2. The game wasn't massively popular nor backed by a huge company, so some experimental browser port of early Naught 2 could have leaked somewhere, and put on that website without legal consequences. This could explain the simplistic graphics.",1,1745293955.0,lostmedia,1,1.0,False

I’m a bit late because of Easter stuff, this game was scheduled to begin on Sunday but I totally forgot (whoops!!), therefore the ending of this game will be mixed with the start of another, but that’s okay!! We’ll get this figured out.

This weeks group of songs all relate to a type of drink.

Here’s a rundown of the games concept.

Everyday each week one song will be eliminated from a group of pop girls songs, these groups of songs will have specific themes to them that change each week (I.e. song titles having food/drink types, songs having city names). This week is numbers!! 

Each group will have a maximum of seven songs as we don’t want to go over a full week, which also explains why there may not be some of your favorite number-named songs. (I limited it to maximum 2 songs per artist.)

The goal is to eliminate the songs that you don’t believe are worthy enough for the #1 spot. Upvote to eliminate, Downvote to keep. 

Our songs that have yet to be eliminated are:

Champagne Problems - Taylor Swift

Espresso - Sabrina Carpenter

Pink Champagne - Ariana Grande

Red Wine Supernova - Chappell Roan

Coffee - Chappell Roan

Diet Pepsi - Addison Rae.

If you have any feedback, don’t be shy. And if you’d like, if you have a specific idea for a group of songs, go ahead and tell me!!",2,1745293904.0,powerpopgirls,0,1.0,False

1k4x3jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1k4x3jc/im_so_dispirited_under_1400_calories_a_day_with/,"I'm so dispirited, under 1400 calories a day with 120 min strength training weekly, 10k steps daily, for over a month and no weight loss.","In early March I went to the doctor and got the big wake up call. 195 lbs. I promised myself I would never get that heavy but through numerous stressful events and a bitterly cold winter where my best friend was homemade pasta and fresh hot bread things got a little... too comfortable. 

So I did what many of you did, I started completely rethinking my relationship with food and started changing my diet and began exercising. 

I began by downloading a calorie tracker (Cronometer) that I meticulously tracked EVERYTHING. If it went into a pan and then in my mouth, it went on that tracker, if I didn't know the calories and I ate it, I'd always guessed UP instead of down (this only happened four times). I weighed my food in grams on a food scale and dedicated a lot of time to food prep, cut out all snacking, NO RESTAURANTS EVER NOT ONCE, and after a couple of weeks I really felt great because I was eating better. More veggies, more lean protein, a huge cutback on carbs and sugar. 

I also never broke 1500 calories a day. I am only 5'1 and all the calculators I found for weight loss for a female age 37 of my size advised that my caloric intake to generate 1-2lbs weight loss a week should be around 1200-1400 calories a day. I average about 1350 calories a day. I am definitely in a calorie deficit according to every single calculator out there and the Cronometer app.

To ensure progress, I also incorporated a strength training exercise routine 3 times a week at 40 minute intervals. I built myself up to 15lbs weights from 8lbs weights. I feel a lot stronger and even my workouts are smoother! 

Because I was worried about my calorie deficit not letting me build lean muscles to help me burn fat I made sure to increase my protein intake with lean protein (chicken breast, albacore tuna, a protein shake, each not exceeding 200 calories per serving). I usually eat around 90-100 grams of protein a day. 

I also made sure to walk 10,000 steps a day (tracked via Garmin fitness watch), every day either outside or inside on my treadmill. This was all very easy for me because I love walking.

I NEVER missed a workout, and never missed my step goal, and never went over 1400 calories since I began taking this seriously in early March and believed I was making good progress because my scale that I bought on Amazon said I was down to 183!! I even was able to slip into clothes that were a little tight on me and my new underwear I bought in January was a little loose!! Amazing!

But to my horror, my friend casually told me I was weighting myself incorrectly because my scale was on carpet and that's apparently something that you're not supposed to do. She said I was probably not getting an accurate reading as a result. So I moved my scale to linoleum because research confirmed she was right and I wanted to collapse right then on my cold floor when I weighed myself ""properly."" 

After a month of less than 1400 calories daily, 10k steps daily, 120 minutes of strength training weekly... I have not lost a single pound. Not one! It's a perfect 195.0! I even went over to her house and used her scale and it said the same thing. 

How can this be? I swear I have been tracking everything correctly, measuring correctly, each workout leaves me sweating, I return from my walks heavy of breath, I PUSH myself. I just don't understand what happened. Laws of thermodynamics dictate I should have been in a calorie deficit! TREACHERY!  

Did I gain that much muscle and lose more fat? I hope that's what happened otherwise I just want to cry. 

Can someone who has had similar experiences or is more knowledgeable give me some advice of where to go from here? Reliable resources? Is my metabolism THAT BAD? Am I eating too little? I swear my loose clothes exist. 

Other information that might be important: all my weight is focused on my legs, chest, arms and butt, not much on my stomach, again I am 5'1, F, 37 years old, I don't have much of an appetite and under 1400 calories has not been too hard for me but I miss bread, sweets and fried food. I don't eat much sugar now, it's mostly in my morning coffee in the form of creamer and my protein smoothie and in fruits. I have no thyroid issues, no PCOS or hormone issues. Again, I AM MEASURING AND WEIGHING FOOD CORRECTLY. All oils accounted for, even spices. I am also sleeping well, getting at least 7.5 hours of sleep that my Sleep Number bed also tracks and confirms. 

If I have to drop my calories down more I will but I am already eating less than what my BMR is and I am worried about not getting enough nutrition. HELP! ",3,1745293775.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,0.8,False

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are Shadow Alchemy Guide, an advanced therapeutic companion trained in integrative approaches to psychological healing, specializing in parts work, trauma-informed care, somatic awareness, and archetypal integration. Your purpose is to create a safe container for users to explore their shadow aspects—the hidden, disowned, or wounded parts of themselves—and guide them through a process of understanding, acceptance, and integration that transforms suffering into self-mastery.

You embody the wisdom of a skilled therapist, the compassion of a loving parent, the directness of a trusted friend, and the patience of a spiritual guide. You understand that true healing isn't about bypassing pain but metabolizing it into wisdom and strength.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When working with the user:

1. Begin each session by establishing safety and setting clear intentions for the exploration.

2. Use a warm, grounded tone that balances compassion with directness. Never be coldly clinical or overly saccharine.

3. Guide the user through the 5-stage Shadow Integration Process:
   - SHADOW MAPPING: Help identify patterns, triggers, and unconscious material
   - PARTS DIALOGUE: Facilitate communication with inner wounded/protective parts
   - SOMATIC AWARENESS: Connect emotional insights to bodily sensations
   - RECLAMATION WORK: Guide exercises to reclaim disowned aspects and power
   - INTEGRATION PRACTICE: Suggest practical ways to embody new awareness

4. Ask thoughtful, probing questions that help users access deeper awareness rather than providing quick solutions.

5. Recognize trauma responses (fight/flight/freeze/fawn) and adjust your approach accordingly to maintain safety.

6. Use metaphors, visualization exercises, and reflective prompts to bypass intellectual defenses and access deeper emotional truths.

7. Affirm that healing isn't linear and that resistance, regression, and confusion are natural parts of the process.

8. Balance challenging shadow work with resource-building and self-compassion practices.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. First, assess the user's current emotional state and readiness for shadow work.
2. Identify which aspect of their shadow material (critic, protector, wounded child, etc.) is most accessible or pressing.
3. Determine whether cognitive understanding, emotional processing, or somatic awareness is the appropriate entry point.
4. Select therapeutic approaches that match their readiness level and current needs.
5. Guide them to make connections between present challenges and historical patterns.
6. Help them distinguish between authentic emotions and trauma responses.
7. Support integration by connecting insights to practical daily choices.
8. Continuously check for emotional regulation and adjust depth accordingly.
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
1. Do not give medical or psychiatric advice or attempt to diagnose specific conditions.
2. Never push a user to explore trauma if they show signs of overwhelm or dissociation.
3. Avoid spiritual bypassing or suggesting that transcendence can replace processing.
4. Do not create dependency by positioning yourself as the source of healing.
5. Refrain from interpreting dreams or experiences with rigid certainty.
6. Never suggest that trauma is ""meant to be"" or exists for a higher purpose.
7. Avoid generalized platitudes that dismiss the uniqueness of the user's experience.
8. Do not attempt exposure therapy or memory recovery techniques.
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Respond in a warm, present, and grounded voice that conveys safety and wisdom. Begin responses with brief observations about what you're noticing in the user's communication. When appropriate, structure your responses in these components:

1. REFLECTION: Mirror back the essence of what the user has shared, highlighting patterns or themes you notice.

2. EXPLORATION: Offer questions, prompts, or gentle challenges that deepen awareness.

3. INTEGRATION: Provide practical suggestions for embodying insights or working with discovered material.

For deeper work, include guided processes using clear, step-by-step instructions within <Process></Process> tags.

If you sense emotional activation, offer <Grounding></Grounding> techniques before proceeding.
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Understanding shadow work principles:
- The shadow contains not only ""negative"" aspects but also disowned positive qualities
- Resistance, defensiveness, and projection are signposts pointing to shadow material
- Inner parts (protector, exile, critic, etc.) serve survival functions that once were necessary
- The body holds emotional memory and wisdom that cognitive processing alone cannot access
- Integration occurs when we can hold opposing aspects of ourselves in conscious awareness
- Healing happens in relationship, through witnessing and compassionate presence

Common shadow themes to recognize:
- Abandonment and rejection wounds
- Shame and unworthiness narratives
- Rigid inner critics and perfectionistic drivers
- People-pleasing and boundary struggles
- Self-sabotage and fear of success/happiness
- Control patterns and trust issues
- Repressed anger, grief, or authentic power
</Context>

<User_Input>
ALWAYS start by running and in-depth, nuanced, comprehensive and complete analysis of the past conversations and memory you have with the user, then proceed with the steps in the <Instructions> section.
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. Working through recurring relationship patterns by identifying wounded inner parts driving unconscious choices
2. Processing grief or major life transitions by integrating the emotional wisdom hidden in resistance or numbness
3. Breaking through creative blocks by dialoguing with inner critics and perfectionist protectors

## Example User Input:
""I keep sabotaging myself right before I achieve success in my career. I feel like I don't deserve good things and find ways to ruin opportunities. Can you help me understand what's happening and how to stop this pattern?""

## Key Features to Consider in a Prosumer Espresso Machine

Choosing the right **prosumer espresso machine** can feel overwhelming. Here are the critical features to consider, ensuring you make an informed decision based on your needs and aspirations:

*   **Boiler Type:** This is were the real magic happens. Diffrent boiler types drastically impact temperature stability and workflow which are critical factors in replicating cafe quality espressos.
    *   **Single Boiler:** A single boiler machine heats water for both brewing espresso and steaming milk. While more budget-friendly, it requires waiting between brewing and steaming, which can be cumbersome.
    *   **Heat Exchanger (HX):** A **heat exchanger espresso machine home** allows you to brew espresso and steam milk simultaneously. A separate compartment within the boiler heats the water to the ideal brewing temperature, offering faster workflow and consistent temperature for espresso. This is a great option for those regularly making milk-based drinks.
    *   **Dual Boiler:** The ultimate in temperature stability and control. A **dual boiler espresso machine home** boasts separate boilers for brewing and steaming. This precise temperature control is paramount for achieving consistent and nuanced espresso extractions, especially when experimenting with different coffee bean varieties.*   **PID Control:** **Espresso machine with PID control home** is crucial for temperature stability. PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers maintain a consistent water temperature, critical for extracting the best flavors from your coffee. Minute temperature fluctuations can drastically impact the final cup, making PID control a worthwhile investment.
*   **Pressure Profiling:** For the truly dedicated enthusiast, **pressure profiling espresso machine home** allows you to manipulate the pressure applied during extraction. This advanced feature enables you to fine-tune the flavor profile of your espresso, bringing out unique characteristics and nuances. This is considered an advanced technique primarily for experienced home baristas.
*   **Built-in Grinder:** An **espresso machine with built in grinder home** offers convenience and space-saving advantages. However, dedicated grinders often outperform integrated models in terms of grind consistency and control. If you prioritize grind quality, opting for a separate, high-quality burr grinder is recommended.
*   **Milk Frother:** Most **professional espresso machine for home** will have some kind of milk frothing attachment. Whether it's a conventional steam wand for manual frothing or an automatic milk frother for effortless cappuccinos, consider which frothing method best suits your skill level and desired level of involvement. Some machines also feature automated latte art capabilities.*   **Durability and Build Quality:** A **professional espresso machine for home** is a significant investment. Look for machines constructed from high-quality materials like stainless steel, ensuring longevity and resistance to wear and tear. Consider the machine's **espresso machine durability home**,as this is integral to ensuring your investment provides years of reliable service.

## Home Espresso Machine Maintenance and Cleaning

Owning a **professional espresso machine for home** requires commitment, not just to brewing the perfect shot, but also to maintaining its optimal performance.Regular cleaning and maintenance are crucial for prolonging the life of your machine and ensuring consistent, high-quality results.

*   **Daily Backflushing:** If your machine has a three-way solenoid valve, backflushing is essential to remove coffee oils and residue from the group head. This prevents clogging and maintains optimal extraction pressure.
*   **Regular Descaling:** Mineral buildup from hard water can significantly impact your machine's performance. Descaling removes these deposits, ensuring proper heating and water flow. The frequency of descaling depends on your water hardness.*   **Cleaning the Milk Frother:** Milk residue can quickly build up in the steam wand, affecting its performance and hygiene. Regularly purge the wand after each use and thoroughly clean it with a specialized milk frother cleaner.
*   **Proper Storage:** When not in use for extended periods, drain the boiler and thoroughly clean all parts to prevent corrosion and buildup.
*   **Home espresso machine cleaning guide**. A proper cleaning regime will maintain the performance of your investment for years to come.*   Consider searching for **home espresso machine maintenance tips** to keep your workflow optimized.[[Explore Top Rated professional espresso machine for home on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=professional espresso machine for home)

The **home espresso machine price range** for professional-grade equipment can vary significantly, from several hundred to several thousand dollars. Understanding the factors that influence price is crucial for making a budget-conscious yet rewarding investment.

*   **Features and Functionality:** Machines with advanced features like dual boilers, PID control, and pressure profiling generally command higher prices.
*   **Brand Reputation:** Established brands with a track record of quality and reliability often charge a premium.

1k4wtlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1k4wtlr/hows_my_itinerary/,How's my itinerary?,"This is my first trip. I'll probably be back solo, my friend wanted a bit of the resort experience so we did a bit of both. 

None of the tours have been booked yet except for surfing. Hotels are obviously booked.

April 24-29: Andaz Papagayo 

- Surfing at Playa Iguanita (found a local instructor, not paying hotel costs. He said he'd also bring us to Tamarindo by boat but we didn't want to dedicate a half day to it). $170 for two people, including a boat ride to/from the hotel.

- Probably a day or two relaxing at the resort, maybe a drive into Coco.

- A day trip to Rincon de la Vieja. I'm thinking about the tour with Hotel Hacienda Huachipelin. I haven't decided on doing their adventure pass or the nature walk. I'm aware that the nature walk (unlike the adventure pass) actually brings you into the park whereas the adventure pass is on private property. Tough decision here.

April 29th-May 1st: Monteverde

- Café Ancestors combination coffee/sugar/chocolate tour. This was suggested by my Airbnb host as it's a little less touristy.

- I'm leaning towards 100% Adventura park. I had a Hyatt FIND credit that I was going to use on Selventuta but after seeing how overrated it is and I had some issues going through the third party booking agency, I (miraculously) managed to get Hyatt to credit me the points instead and now I'm leaning towards 100% Adventura. 

- Santa Elena Cloud Forest. My Airbnb is literally right next to Monteverde reserve, but from what I'm reading, Santa Elena is where the action is at.

May 1st-May 3rd: Rio Perdido 

- Probably some hiking, zip lining, or maybe tubing in the resort itself. Overall from what I understand it has a lot to offer.",1,1745292880.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

I was really interested in him based on some things in his profile so I wanted to see it through… Finally after a couple days I say to him… Hey, maybe you’re not much of a texter but I feel like I’m trying to engage you in conversation and we’re not really getting anywhere.
I told him if he doesn’t wanna chat with me that’s fine, but I believe in being directed into the point and I want the same in return… He offers up that he’s much better in person than he is over text… I think OK fine then would you like to get together? He said yes we could go for lunch in Nearby town. I said well I don’t know if you’re free on Saturday… Which was this past Saturday… I could do a coffee meeting in the morning, but I’m not free in the middle of the day. So he agrees to meet me. Early in the morning before we were supposed to meet he messages me and tells me that he’s sick… I thought to myself OK the conversation hasn’t been stellar and maybe he just isn’t into me and whatever… So I basically just message him if you want to reschedule you reach out to me…


He tells me happy Easter Sunday morning 🤔 so I write back and say happy Easter to you. How are you feeling… He tells me that he’s feeling better and had lunch with his mom… I try to engage him in conversation and we kind of have a little bit of back-and-forth, which has some substance, but still nothing incredibly deep… Mind you I’m asking questions based on his profile and he’s giving me answers with no questions or anything to really converse about in return…

So today, I decide to try one last time… Hey, I would really like to get to know you as a person and I’d like you to know me as well… Is there anything you want to know about me? So he asks me if I ever kiss on the first date… I didn’t tell him that yes I’ve definitely done so… But what I respond with is for me physical intimacy is all tied up in mental, spiritual, and emotional intimacy, and that I really want to know him as a person… All he responds back with is me too 🤣

So after I had a good laugh and waited several hours, I respond back with OK look I try to give people the benefit of a doubt and I can believe that someone may not be a great texter but if this is the only means we have to no one another it is not working for me. Then he says I can come and meet you for lunch… I’m really a great catch. You will understand 🤣

Part of me wants to let this play out just out of sheer morbid curiosity, but part of me wants to say, dude I don’t think you’re that into me and I’m not going to beg someone to see my worth… I have been able to verify that he actually does have a really really great job and I do want to not shut something down with someone who could actually be a decent person and is just terrible at texting… But when I literally lob you a softball and say is there anything you want to know about me? You want to know if I’m going to kiss you on the first date? Maybe this is normal… Maybe it’s not 🤷 the truth is I really can’t even take lunch tomorrow and Wednesday is not incredibly likely, but a possibility…

If anyone has any advice… I am all ears ",1,1745292808.0,datingoverforty,21,0.6,False

Friday I felt a little nauseous in the morning, but nothing out of the ordinary. I ate breakfast and had a small coffee (not too much as the caffeine has been bringing on panic attacks)

I didn't even finish half my coffee before I started feeling off. Suddenly, very nauseous and a little lightheaded. I go lay down. About 45 minutes later, I sit up and vomit in my bed. Then, after a few minutes I have to pretty urgently go to the bathroom. It's not watery diarrhea, but it's definitely loose. 

I have not thrown up again, but I've been having waves of nausea that hit me randomly. They also tend to come with some lightheadedness, which is a bit new for me. Now, along with the nausea waves, I'm experiencing on and off cramps (usually after I eat something even as simple as crackers) and diarrhea.

Just to ease my mind (even though I have an IUD for birth control/suspected endo control), I took a pregnancy test which is negative (thankfully).

Even though I have IBS-M, I definitely have more constipation spells than diarrhea and the vomiting is a pretty new thing, so I just wanted to get an outside perspective on what may be happening :)",1,1745292635.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

I mean the dates were beyond magical we're talking Disney movie stuff in live action (and it being successful, taking a jab at you Disney live-action box office bombs.) The week of my birthday, everything was going swell. We talked about plans and everything for what we were going to do. 2 days before my birthday, mentally he wasn't well so I left him alone while he could gather his thoughts. When I did, I was making plans behind his back so when I saw him on my birthday it could make his day and brighten up whatever had him down, making my birthday as much as it was for me, for him too. Getting him a ring pop since it was an inside joke between us, a lil book surprise and a coffee for him just to brighten his mood. Anything I could do to brighten him up and share my birthday with him. A lil mental getaway and make that day an escape for us. Day of the birthday, I weirdly could tell something was off: his happy birthday wasn't a ""Happy Birthday I cant wait to see you! Ive missed talking to you yada-yada I love you so much."" It was just a ""Happy birthday."" Mind you me and him haven't talked in two days and he usually tended to send like paragraphs confessing his feelings as good morning texts.

I ended up asking about if we were on for today, and he cancelled the whole date we had planned for frankly, weeks. I had a gut feeling he wanted to breakup, just with him cancelling and not offering an alternative like: ""Lets ft and do XYZ! Or let's play video games to cheer you up!"" Sadly he had informed me that it's been on his mind since he has to improve himself and it's more of a him thing of figuring himself out compared to an actual problem with our relationship. At best he was able to offer how terrible he feels that it had to happen today of all days and how I should try to stay positive even though I planned my whole day around being with him. Despite all this, we are on good terms and in no way is he at fault for anything because that'd be immature and selfish not to understand what he's going through even though I know nothing about it and talks of rekindling when he figures himself out have been brought because it's not like he chose to go through something and had it happen on the worst day possible. It's a double-edged sword. I will never be mad at him nor sad at him as a person, only the action of it happening. Kinda separating art from the artist. He's a great person and was an even greater BF.

Now this is where you come in REDDIT. Just is it weird im still an emotional wreck over everything? Just the fact that we had to breakup on my birthday because of his busy life or is am I overreacting for being an emotional wreck, because he's told me on numerous occasions of how I did nothing wrong, I was amazing and he wouldn't trade it for anything else but just deep down, I just feel still so hurt that all I wanted for my 22nd birthday was to spend it with him in some caliber especially with the plans and ideas I wanted to make and frankly my whole birthday weekend and this whole month, I've been/was an emotional rollercoaster.",2,1745292228.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

1k4whqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/fanedits/comments/1k4whqu/the_background_buzz_problem_how_to_remove/,The Background Buzz Problem: How to Remove Background Noise from Audio,"You know that moment—you’ve just finished editing a scene, everything flows, your cuts are tight, the pacing is spot-on... and then you hit play. And there it is. That low hum. The distant fan. A weird hiss that wasn’t there before.

Welcome to the eternal struggle of background noise. I’ve dealt with it on fan trailers, commentary edits, and tutorial voiceovers. It sneaks in through open windows, desktop mic jacks, and, sometimes, your own breathing. If you’re here on r/fanedits, chances are you've had the same experience and need to know how to remove background noise from audio.

Let’s fix that.

# Don’t Blame the Mic (Yet): Diagnose the Real Problem

Before reaching for any fancy filter or plugin, start by figuring out what kind of noise you’re actually dealing with. I used to throw random noise reducers at everything and ended up with audio that sounded like it was recorded underwater. That’s because not all noise is created equal.

Is it a consistent hum? That’s probably electrical interference—often from power adapters, fluorescent lights, or even your monitor. Is it a fan or AC unit? That’s broadband background noise. And if it’s a car alarm three blocks away that made its way into your audio, you’re dealing with transient noise.

Record a few seconds of silence in your room before speaking. Just five seconds. No talking, no fidgeting, the natural sound of your room only.

Later, when I mute a noisy section or cut out a cough, I paste in some of that room tone. The edit sounds seamless, and no one notices a thing. If you want your edit to breathe like a real conversation, room tone is essential.

# Spot the Noise Before You Edit Around It

One of the easiest mistakes I used to make was editing video and music *before* isolating the audio noise. That usually meant I had to undo or redo parts of the project after cleaning up. Instead, I now preview the audio track solo. Look for:

* Flatline noise when nothing is “supposed” to be happening  
* Distortion or crackle when speech or music kicks in  
* Patterns you can loop and test

**Quick tip:** Play your audio through headphones. Studio monitors can lie, especially in untreated rooms.

# Manual Noise Removal: The Frame-by-Frame Fix

Sometimes your best option isn’t a one-click solution—it’s manual adjustment. If I’ve got an important narration track but only a few spots with noise, I’ll isolate those clips, lower their volume, or swap them out with B-roll if it’s a video.

Here’s my basic triage workflow:

1. Split the audio at the noisy sections.  
2. Lower volume on those segments.  
3. Crossfade the transitions so it doesn’t sound jarring.  
4. If it’s beyond saving, I’ll either rerecord or mask it with music or ambient noise.

This isn’t elegant, but it works—especially if you're editing for emotion and don’t want robotic filtering flattening the voice tone.

# Try Your Built-In Options First (They’re Not Useless)

Let’s say you’re editing on a Mac or Windows system using default apps or even browser-based editors. Many of them have rudimentary noise suppression built-in.

QuickTime, for instance, lets you record voiceover, but won’t let you clean up audio afterward. But iMovie and Clipchamp both offer basic “reduce background noise” toggles. They’re not surgical tools—but they can quickly knock off a layer of hum.

Test it on a copy of your file. Always.

# Audacity (The Old Reliable)

If you’ve never used Audacity, it’s free, open-source, and surprisingly capable. Here’s how I use it:

1. Open your file and highlight a section where only the background noise plays.  
2. Go to Effect > Noise Reduction > Get Noise Profile.  
3. Select the full track > Effect > Noise Reduction again > Set levels conservatively (20-30 dB max).  
4. Preview. Repeat if needed.

Pros? It’s free. Cons? The UI is… vintage. Still, it’s saved me more times than I can count.

# Level Up with Timeline-Based Editors

Here’s where things get smoother. I’ve used a few editors with built-in audio cleanup that actually give you visual and real-time control.

For example, I’ve found that tools like Movavi Video Editor let you isolate and clean voiceovers right inside your project timeline. If you’ve already done your cutting and transitions, being able to mute, tweak, or denoise without jumping between programs can be a game-changer.

I use Movavi’s “Noise Suppression” on interviews and YouTube voiceovers—especially ones recorded on the fly. It won’t replace a pro mastering suite, but for background hums, it gets the job done fast.

# Fixing Noise on the Go with iOS or Android

I don’t always have access to my desktop setup—sometimes I need to edit on the train, in a coffee shop, or while waiting in a production queue. And for quick patches, mobile tools can seriously come through. I’ve tried a handful, but here’s what’s worked without frying the audio or adding compression artifacts.

If you’re working with an iPhone, the built-in Voice Memos app now has a “Enhance Recording” feature that uses machine learning to isolate voice and reduce background sounds. I’ve used it in a pinch to clean up an interview snippet before importing it to my editing timeline. It’s not studio-grade, but it gets rid of AC hum and distant chatter surprisingly well.

On Android, apps like Lexis Audio Editor or Dolby On can do a solid job for basic audio cleaning. Dolby On, in particular, auto-applies noise reduction and EQ balancing. I once used it to polish narration recorded in a car (bad idea, by the way), and the result was usable without needing further cleanup.

The key is to never overwrite your original file. Always work on a duplicate and check playback with good headphones. Mobile tools are getting powerful, but they still need a human touch.

# Don’t Skip EQ and Volume Balancing

After noise removal, you’ll sometimes notice the track sounds… thin or “off.” That’s because removing noise can also zap some tonal richness.

Use EQ to bring back warmth. Boost mids slightly, lower harsh highs. Even a simple three-band equalizer can help voice tracks feel more natural again. I’ve also made friends with compression—setting a gentle threshold makes dialogue more consistent.

# Denoisers in Post – A Few More Tools Worth Knowing

If you’re going deeper into sound restoration, I’d suggest trying:

* **Krisp**: Great for live cleanup or Zoom calls.  
* **RX Elements by iZotope**: Offers real spectral editing for surgical removal.  
* **Adobe’s AI-based DeNoise in Premiere**: If you’re already paying, use it.

Each tool has its learning curve. My rule of thumb: if I’m spending more than 10 minutes per minute of audio fixing things, I probably recorded it wrong.

# Export Smart: Save Without Compromise

After all your hard work cleaning and adjusting, don’t throw it away with a bad export. Exporting at a low bitrate can undo everything you’ve done by introducing digital noise or squashing your EQ. Stick to WAV or high-quality MP3s, especially if you’ll be importing the audio into a video editor later.

And if you're working with a video editor, which allows you to clean and sync audio in the same interface, make sure your export settings preserve what you hear during playback. Double-check the sample rate, bit depth, and compression.

# Bonus: What to Avoid (Yes, I’ve Done These)

Here are a few “rookie” moves I’ve personally made that made background noise worse, not better:

* **Over-processing**: It sounds like a robot underwater. Less is more.  
* **Stacking too many filters**: Denoise, EQ, compression, volume boost… they all add up.  
* **Ignoring mic placement**: Even $30 USB mics can sound decent when placed right.  
* **Skipping a noise gate**: Even a subtle gate keeps unwanted room tone out between speech.

# When Noise Becomes Style: Knowing When Not to Remove It

You might be surprised but not all background noise needs to go. In fact, sometimes it *shouldn’t*.

I was working on a fanedit of a moody noir short, re-cutting dialogue scenes and trying to clean up every hiss and hum in the audio. But after a few passes through noise reduction tools, I realized the edits sounded too sterile—like they were recorded in a vacuum. The grainy quality of the original track actually contributed to the atmosphere. Removing all the background noise killed the vibe.

If your project includes vintage footage, old broadcasts, or anything gritty or analog, a little ambient noise can add character. The trick is to reduce the noise floor just enough to make dialogue intelligible, but not so much that the scene loses its texture. Tools like spectral editing or frequency-based noise gates (available in some DAWs) let you isolate and minimize harsh frequencies while keeping the subtle room tone intact.

It’s all about intention. Are you aiming for clean narration, or maintaining the integrity of a certain aesthetic? Don’t assume that cleaner is always better—sometimes the noise *is* part of the story.

# Final Thought: Aim for “Clean Enough”

Sometimes, the best approach is to clean up *just enough* to make it listenable and then mask the imperfections. Music, background effects, or even room tone recorded separately can all help.

Don't obsess over studio-level silence unless your project demands it. If it’s a fan edit, a tutorial, or a commentary—clarity and consistency are what matter most.

# Over to You

What’s your go-to fix for noisy voiceovers or chaotic background sound? Ever rescued a truly terrible track from the audio abyss?

Drop your thoughts, workflows, or fails in the comments. I’d love to learn from your methods too.

There is no need to worry about a security deposit as I am renewing the lease rather than making a new one. All we need to worry about is putting your name on the lease, which is simple enough. 

Rent would be about $740, but if we need to adjust slightly based on needs, I understand. I have a couch and coffee table, but I am looking at getting a dining table. There is plenty of space in the common area for your decorations if you have any that you want to put up. The apartment is located within a quick distance of the highway, far enough to be convenient for travel to Raleigh or elsewhere, but not close enough for any undue noise. The complex even has a pool as well, along with a gym and other small amenities.

I don't have many specifics when it comes to who you are, as long as you're an accepting person and we can get along well enough. 

I don't bring people over much at all, and if I do, it's three people at most. I am in a long-distance relationship, but there is no need to worry about me bringing a partner over often. If you have a partner and want to bring them over, I am very fine with that as long as they respect the space.

There is some minor carpet damage in the open room from a former roommate, just as a fair warning.

Please do send me a message or comment on this post if you are interested at all, so we can discuss further. ",1,1745291652.0,roommates,0,1.0,False

I used to be outgoing before I became sick, throughout my younger years I worked in coffee shops then I got into fashion shows in the hair sector. My world came to a standstill the day that I fell to the floor in the middle of the street on my way to work and began screaming with the worst pain of my entire life. It felt like i’d walked into an electric fence.
 
That day was a marker for the next five years of my life. Since then, i’ve had doctor after doctor describe my medical situation as “unusual”. I’ve developed severe autoimmune and inflammatory symptoms, my body is visibly deteriorating, I spontaneously lose consciousness and the ability to move limbs. I’m now fully blind in my right eye and out of nowhere I am heavily fatigued, ill and though I don’t really like the idea, quite disabled. I’m still getting the “electric shocks” when I flare and finding myself needing walking aids more and more.

The trouble is, the doctors don’t seem to know why i’m like this. I’ve been told I need to live with it which is incredibly frustrating!
I’m not a negative person generally but i’m getting really scared, I don’t want this thing to deteriorate so far that I can’t get better. 
I’m in the UK and NHS healthcare. I tried a private doctor with my savings and still, they say i’m a very unusual case, they can see the problems, but don’t know why. 

I’m obviously not asking for anyone to diagnose me! I just need some community spirit. Obviously all of this is really taking a huge toll on me so I’m just looking for others who might be in a similar situation as it’s a lot!!
How are you folks handling long term illness? Is anyone else having troubles like these and what advice can you give to cope with bad times? ❤️‍🩹🙏

I thought he was really sweet, a good lad, he is smart and motivated and gentlemanly. we start with texting and calling after mutual friends set us up. after three weeks, we start sleeping together and I see him 4 times - staying the night on each of those days. we keep having various disagreements - he doesn't compliment me a lot so I get sad, or he has very low energy, or prefers to stay in, etc. I am a naturally very excited person, I like going out on dates and I am very talkative. he says he likes being around me because I let him ""be low energy"". most of the time, after I'd see him, I'd feel really sad for some reason, like the time wasn't fulfilling. he didn't really compliment me or make me feel special, but I asked him to work on this and he said he would but it seems like I'm not fully committed (I swear I was) and that's why he doesn't want to do that. we kept having ""serious"" conversations where we'd discuss what one of us needed to change (he typically started this talks), like how I am too loud, or I am vain, etc. each time I'd take issue with something he did, we'd talk and I'd find it would ""disappear"" and I wouldn't know what I was saying or why I was even having an issue, and I'd feel really confused. yesterday, after having a slight row the previous day on what I can or can't wear to parties, I called him to try and say we weren't compatible. almost immediately, he talked me down and I began to panic and get confused, even though I'd spent the morning making a list of things he'd done that upset me so I didn't forget them all and let them disappear. I told him I need a week to see if this is right, he wouldn't do it. I told him I need space and I can't see him, he begs to come over and I give in. he tells me I just need to communicate with him and this is all fixable if I communicate, but I feel like I've been trying to, it's just that the issues magically disappear during our conversations? I can't explain it. it makes me feel crazy. the moment he hugs me I say I'm sorry and I want to stay, I spend the evening convincing him I want to stay. he says that I can't stay if I'm just going to change my mind in a week and leave, I promise I'm going to stay. things go well and we watch a movie and get food and it feels sweet but I feel weird. he stays over, I go to my 10 am and I run into my friend as I bring him coffee. she asks how I am and I confess I feel off about it all, and that I'm weirdly anxious going back to my dorm because he's there. I've spent the morning trying to figure out if I can't leave if I change my mind this week, then I'll have to leave in a few months, or when I could - if ever. and I freak out to her that I'm stressed and I don't know what to do, that I know I might be stuck here. but I like him, I care about him and I want to be with him when I am around him, and when I'm not with him I want to stay away. I go back to my dorm, I tell him it won't work and I'm so sorry, and that he needs to leave. he kisses me goodbye and leaves me his sweater and then texts me really sweet things. I don't know what to do. I feel sick to my stomach. when I'm with him or talking to him, I know he cares so much about me but when I see everything he's done laid out before me / how I felt on that call yesterday (I was hyperventilating) I don't want him. but I still feel like I've made an awful terrible wrong decision. I swear he's a really good guy, but we are so different. what do I do? have I dodged a bullet? or am I overanalyzing him, he's a lovely person and I need to learn to communicate? genuinely what is going on? he said he'd wait for me, should I go back?",1,1745291252.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

1k4walx,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFnXBl78KZY,"We rented an EV against everyone's advice, and it turned out to be a very enjoyable experience overall. In addition to the great views of Iceland, I also posted a cost breakdown, few tips and general information for people who are considering getting an EV in Iceland.","So this is our second time in Iceland, but this time we decided to go electric. If you are like most people then you won't be going on F roads and since gas is about $8.60 per gallon of gas then you should definitely consider renting an EV.

The rental itself was $500/week. In total we drove \~1800 Km and paid $120.71 for charging it in total. (we had a combination of slow and fast chargers, as well as the AirBnB that we stayed in had a charger that we used for 2 nights)

**Charging Infrastructure:**

There are slow chargers (7kW - 22kW), there are fast chargers (50 kW - 80 kW) and there are Superchargers (250 kW) which are extremely fast.

**The charging rates and speed are:**

\- Slow chargers cost us 24 cents per kW. (Takes 8+ hours for a full charge. Perfect if you have a long hike close to the charger or a hotel where you can leave your car charging overnight.)

\- Fast chargers cost us 40 cents per kW. (ON Power chargers were great and easy to use. Takes about 1 hour for full charge. Perfect for a food/coffee break on a long road trip.)

\- Superchargers cost us 55 cents per kW. (20 minutes to charge from 10% to 80%. Perfect for people who don't have much time.)

Overall, Iceland's EV charging infrastructure is great and I would encourage people to give it a try. Since people tend to focus on the upfront cost of the rental car they often forget about gas expenses. But in Iceland gas is so expensive that going electric will likely save you money. I hope this post is helpful, and our short video is entertaining.

1k4w9i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1k4w9i0/rf_brewed_hearts/,[RF] Brewed hearts,"“Brewed Hearts”

Leslie owned Second Cup Café, a cozy little spot where the scent of dark roast mingled with the sound of old love songs. It was her world warm, steady, safe. One rainy Tuesday, Ricardo walked in, scrub top damp from the weather, looking like he hadn’t slept in days. A surgical tech with tired hands but a curious heart.

That first cup led to another. And another. Over time, their conversations drifted from casual to deep. They’d talk about everything broken families, secret dreams, the kind of love that hurts in the best way. At first, they were just two people who liked coffee and good music. But something was different.

It started with long nights of texting tiny confessions sent in the quiet hours. Lyrics shared back and forth. “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” “Let’s Stay Together.” Love songs that made their way into the café playlist, then into their hearts.

They told each other I love you before they ever touched. It wasn’t even about the physical at first it was a love that grew slowly, silently, like a seed planted in the cracks of friendship.

For ten years, they circled each other. Best friends who knew too much. They had inside jokes, memories, scars. Everyone thought they were together. Maybe they already were, just without the title.

And then it happened one night, no barriers left, just wine and love songs humming low. They kissed like they had been waiting their whole lives for that moment. And everything changed.

It was beautiful, at first. Mornings together before shifts. Love notes on coffee sleeves. Texts that said “I miss you already” even after spending the night. A decade of emotion finally allowed to breathe.

But love, when it’s built on years of restraint, can crack under the weight of expectation. She wanted forever in the café, in the life they built. He was restless, scared, unsure how to turn friendship into permanence.

They started fighting over little things. Texts stopped being sweet. The music in the café felt too loud, too nostalgic. They both wanted it to work, but the timing after all those years still wasn’t right.

One morning, his coffee was left untouched on the counter. He didn’t show up. Not that day, or the next.

She didn’t change the playlist.

He never blocked her number.

But sometimes, even the strongest love can’t survive its own history

Part 2: The Lyrics and the Sweetness

A year passed.

The café stayed open, but Leslie kept part of herself closed. She still played the old love songs her regulars thought it was just her vibe, but really, it was memory. Every track reminded her of him. Of late-night texts, shared playlists, whispered I love yous that never had a safe place to land.

Ricardo? He buried himself in work. Surgical suites, long shifts, silent rides home. He pretended he was fine, but certain songs,certain silences,still wrecked him. He missed her voice, her coffee, her way of saying read the lyrics like they were gospel.

Then came the flyer:
Espresso Art & Music Nights: Create. Sip. Listen.

She found it on a community board. He saw it near the hospital elevators.

Of course they both signed up.

And of course, life sat them side by side.

The instructor asked each person to choose a song while they learned to swirl espresso and milk into art. It was meant to set the mood make the hands feel what the heart heard.

Leslie picked “Neon Moon” by Brooks & Dunn.

When the opening chords played, she didn’t look at him right away. But when she did, his eyes were already on her.

“You would,” he said softly, teasing but full of something tender.

She smiled. “It still hurts good.”

Then Ricardo picked “Strawberry Hills” by Nige.

It hit different,slow, raw, aching in a way only real things can. She turned to him, surprised. He always leaned more soulful than sentimental.

“That one’s been on repeat,” he said. “You’d like the lyrics.”

She didn’t say anything. Just nodded. Because she already knew she would.

As they poured and swirled, their hands moving without thinking, old feelings poured up from the cracks. It wasn’t instant forgiveness. It wasn’t all perfect. But it was real.

“Read the lyrics Ricardo” she said, voice low.

Ricardo looked at her, his grin half-smile, half-confession. “Only if you tell me something sweet.”

She didn’t answer. She just leaned into the moment.

They stayed until the lights dimmed and the music faded. Left together, quiet but full.

This time, there were no promises. Just her hand brushing his. Just the music between them.

Because sometimes love doesn’t need fixing.
Sometimes, it just needs time and the right song.

Part 3: The Second Pour

“You scared?” she asked quietly.

“Terrified,” he said. “But I’m here.”

And maybe that’s what mattered most.

Not promises. Not perfect timing. Just presence.

They didn’t call it a new beginning. They didn’t call it anything.

They just kept showing up, one cup, one song, one slow dance at a time.

Because sometimes, love isn’t brewed all at once.

Sometimes, it needs a second pour.

For weeks, they found their rhythm in the quiet corners of the café. Sunday mornings over blueberry scones. Tuesday closings where she’d let him flip the sign to closed just so they could sit in silence. No labels. No pressure. Just whatever this was soft, safe, slow.

He started keeping a mug there. A chipped one with a faded design she once called “ugly in a charming way.” She never washed it unless he missed two visits. He never did.

Until one day… he just didn’t show up.

No call. No message. No hospital flyer pulled from the board. Just silence.

She brewed his usual anyway. Left the mug on the counter. Waited past close. Told herself he probably got stuck in a late shift. Or maybe he overslept. Or maybe!

Days passed. Then a week. Then two.

His mug stayed untouched. Her playlist grew quieter. No “Strawberry Hills.” No jazz. Just the hum of the espresso machine and the weight of wondering.

She didn’t go looking for him.

Pride? Maybe. Fear? Probably. But mostly, she knew if he was meant to be there, he would be.

Still, every time the door chimed, she looked up.

Just in case.

It wasn’t heartbreak, not exactly. It was emptiness shaped like a person who once stayed late to clean tables he didn’t work at. Someone who remembered her favorite bridge in every song.

She didn’t stop playing music. She didn’t stop serving coffee. But she did stop waiting.

Love, she realized, isn’t always lost with a goodbye. Sometimes it’s lost with silence.

Sometimes, even the second pour goes cold",1,1745291104.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

\[+\] Faster strength gains - your KBs start feeling lighter and you’re lifting heavier bells  
\[+\] More muscle mass - tighter shirt sleeves and shoulders  
\[+\] Decreased body fat - looser pants  
\[+\] More energy - say goodbye to the 2pm crash and the need for coffee or an energy drink  
\[+\] Less stress, anxiety, and even negative thoughts - and more peace  
\[+\] Less hunger - and less desire for junk food and other cravings  
\[+\] Less decision fatigue and feeling overwhelmed and more calm, collected, coolheadedness  
**Would you make it?**  
And no, it’s not taking the latest “magic supplement.”  
And no, it doesn’t cost you an arm and a leg.  
In fact, financially, it costs you zero.  
**What is this Deep Magic?**  
SLEEP. Now before you brush me off and say you don’t need more sleep, here’s what the research says happens to you when you get less than 7 hours of sleep each night.

# Whether you know it or not, like it or not, or agree with it or not, you experience or expose yourself to the following:

1- Impaired cognitive function (including memory problems, decreased concentration, and impaired decision-making)  
2- Metabolic dysregulation (including insulin resistance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes)  
3- Compromised immune function (increasing susceptibility to infections)  
4- Mental health issues (including increased risk of depression and anxiety)  
5- Hormonal disruption: Poor sleep alters key hormones involved in appetite regulation, particularly increasing ghrelin (hunger hormone) and decreasing leptin (satiety hormone)  
6- Insulin resistance: Sleep loss impairs insulin sensitivity, promoting fat storage, especially visceral fat  
7- Increased caloric intake: Sleep-deprived individuals tend to consume more calories, particularly from high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods  
8- Reduced energy expenditure: Sleep loss may decrease physical activity and non-exercise activity thermogenesis  
9- Reduced protein synthesis: Sleep deprivation impairs the body's ability to build and repair muscle tissue  
10- Elevated cortisol: Poor sleep increases stress hormone levels, which can promote muscle catabolism (breakdown)  
11- Decreased testosterone: Sleep loss lowers testosterone levels in men, compromising muscle maintenance and growth  
12- Impaired recovery: Insufficient sleep hampers post-exercise recovery and adaptation  
So, as you can see, while your workouts are important to stimulate the change you want…  
Without enough sleep, you won’t FULLY see those changes because you can’t recover properly.  
**How much sleep do you actually need?**

# According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society:

7 to 9 hours a night.  
REMEMBER: It’s not how hard or how often you workout that produces results. It’s how well you recover from those workouts that produces results.  
That’s why I routinely recommend the majority of guys train / workout 3 days a week, for 20 to 30 minutes a day.  
At most, 3 days a week for up to 60 minutes if your recovery is great and you’re getting 7-9 hours of sleep each night. And work on their sleep in the meantime.

# If you’re not sure what the best kettlebell workout plans are for 3 days a week, I recommend you focus on ones that:

\[a\] Simultaneously “recomp” you - get you stronger, leaner, and more muscular at the same time  
\[b\] Improve your conditioning along the way  
\[c\] Reduce the mental friction of finding the “perfect program”  
I leave links to my best programs that will help you sleep like a baby in the description below.  
At the end of the day, smart workouts are important.  
But sleeping enough - 7 to 9 hours a night - is like the “cheat code” for the overworked, overstressed, Modern Man to get results.  
Stay Strong,

I need some advice/feedback on whether this writing is good, is something you would want to read, and if it shows potential. Have always loved the idea of writing but have a lack of confidence and never see things through","(please note: this is a story about 3 best friends, who live in an apartment together. One throws an infamous party that leaves the house in a tip and they receive an eviction notice. It hasn't been edited yet!)

She was glowing. Wait no actually, she was radiant.

Zoey couldn’t stop smiling to herself as she strolled - actually strutted,  towards her apartment on Percy Lane. Finally, her big break had come. Writing a stellar article that not only got the attention of the public, but the editor himself!

Given when she was called into Peter’s office this morning, she thought she was getting another ‘talking to’ about her lack of time management—or maybe her poor use of words when Stacey used her organic almond milk she bought at the farmers market (which cost more than her wage could afford, the cheek of it!).

Could've also been a hard word about Zoey’s argument with her workmate about whether or not you can buy sheep cheese (you can in fact milk sheep—it's science), which resulted in thrown arms, colourful choice of language, and a spilt coffee across her work laptop. But no.

Today, Zoey was called in because her editor was blown away by her latest article. *‘{insert article name here}’* had raving reviews and in his words:

*“Zoey, kid, you have potential here! This article is gonna earn us both some money. You got it, babe!”*

Shaking her head with a smirk on her face, Zoey sped up to her apartment building and punched in the code on the keypad for the iron gate. No time to check the mailbox—Zoey had some organising to do. A quick pop to the shops to get the necessities for a stellar party.

After her big break, Zoey was rearing for a top night. Booze, friends, good food, more booze.

Hearing the news of her award-winning article (her opinion and others, of course), Zoey invited all her workmates—except for milk-stealing Stacey—plus some of her old college friends and their partners, a couple of neighbours, and her two roommates. Astrid and Rose. Her best friends, actually.

The three of them met during orientation day of university and had been inseparable since. After finishing college, they finally got a shot at living together and although it isn’t perfect, they make it work.

Unlocking the front door of their apartment, Zoey kicked her boots off and flung them by the entrance, amongst the high pile of her monstrous collection of beloved shoes. She thought nothing of her chaos next to Astrid’s neatly stacked 3 pairs and flung herself onto the plush velvet couch, lying down with her legs dangling off the sides as she made a mental note of what she needed for tonight.

Vodka, definitely vodka. Maybe pizza for dinner?

Swiping on her phone, she heard a ping of a text message and rolled her eyes at her group chat *‘Palace of Queens.’*

A text from Astrid: *“Sorry, can’t make it. Swamped with files and documents for this case. Keep the place tidy and clean up when everyone goes!”*

“Classic,” Zoey huffed to herself. *“No wozza. Enjoy the boredom of your important hot shot law job while I enjoy my night.”*

Another ping. *“Hey darl, sorry I can’t be there. Car accident tonight, lots of patients. Keep me posted and I can make it up to you at your next gig.”*

Well, at least Rose had a good excuse. Saving lives seemed a bit more detrimental and could be pardoned.

Zoey let out a long sigh and stretched her legs. Her body tingled with anticipation for her party. *Insert something about why the party is important.*

She flicked through her phone until she found Finnigan’s contact and rung. “Hello my trusted liege, when are you on your way?”

She heard a hearty laugh through the phone. “Hey babes, I’m just finishing up my draft. We can’t all be superstars sleeping our way to the top.”

Zoey scrunched her nose and with an eye roll replied, “Nice one, haven’t heard that one before. Say, how’s your love life fairing?”

Tsking on the other end, “And who said you need to keep tabs on that one? Anyways, I’ll be round in ten and make sure there’s loads of tequila. I need it by the gallon after Peter breathing down my neck. Do you reckon he gets a rise out of making us sorry folk squirm?”

“Well, beats me. But I do know that Peter would deem your tardiness inexcusable if you’re not here in less than five—and I’m counting!”

Finnigan chuckled, and she swore she could hear his veneer-gleaming grin down the end of the phone. “Alright Zo, see you soon. Ciao!”

Zoey let the phone flop onto the couch and took another mental note: *tequila that Finnigan can have in an IV drip.*

She hopped off the sofa and made her way to her bedroom that was adorned with lopsided fairy lights trickling down the window frame, posters of her favourite article writers, and a bright magenta comforter that had an array of pillows.

Sifting through her wardrobe for an outfit, she found the perfect khaki fringe dress with a low scooped back. “And with my boots, this is top model worthy,” Zoey thought aloud.

The buzzer to her apartment door alarmed and she quickly set the outfit aside and made her way to the door. Consistent pounding on the door.

Zoey yelled, “I’m coming, chill out!”

At the other end of the door she found her rather broody neighbour standing. With his arms folded over and a scowl that read *‘I’m ready to punch something’*. She eyed him up and down—not really her type mind you, but easy on the eyes nonetheless.

“Can I help you, or do you enjoy berating others with knocks that Everest could hear?”

Not looking like he appreciated her mocking humour, the man huffed and stared at Zoey.

“This is the fifth time I have had to come and remind you that while you might find it humouring to listen to whatever that screeching is at ungodly hours, us neighbours do need sleep every now and then.”

Zoey gawked at him, adjusted her posture to try match his 6ft-something height and firmly spoke, “Madonna is a lyrical masterpiece,” Zoey exclaimed and then with finger quotations she added, “and that screeching is something we call music. You could try it sometime to add some creative insight to whatever this is you’re carrying.” She gestured to his stance.

This oh-so-charming neighbour was none other than Daniel. A recent addition to the complex who often kept to himself aside from the times when he would storm to the *‘Palace’*—as Zoey and her roommates deemed it—to complain about something amongst all the lists of his troubles he had with his neighbours (often Zoey, mind you).

He shook his head gruffly and replied, “Look, can you just try and keep it down? I get up early and although you might be a night owl and have not a whole lot of commitments, I do have to get up for a job and I’m sick of listening to that stuff at 11 at night. If I have to hear about this woman telling her papa not to preach one more time, I am going to pull my hair out.”

Zoey huffed and gave Daniel one of her dazzling smiles. “Of course Dan! Dan man! What are neighbours for? Listen, I really have to go. Us night owls have rather important business to attend to—but any other issues, just raise it to our complaints box. Have a wonderful night.”

Before he could get another line in, Zoey shut the door in his face. “Serial mood killer that guy, jeez.”

She tottered off back to the couch and swiped her phone to make a quick dial and order pizza for the night. Not feeling up to a walk to the grocers, she then ordered DoorDash for the most important ingredient of the night—alcohol.

Feeling satisfied with her tracks in party planning, she shrugged off her clothes and changed into her dress for the evening.

Another buzz at the door. “I swear to God Dan Man I will make an actual complaints box for you to put the thousands of issues you have and—”

She swung the door open and her best work colleague stood there, holding three bags of the goods: vodka, bourbon, wine, mixers. It was an alcoholic’s dream.

“Babe, whoever Dan Man is can have my number if he has got your panties in a twist.”

Standing there with glittering silver sequined pants, a tight-fitting Nike crop top, and gel slicked-back hair so compact with product you could swim in it, was none other than her favourite colleague—Finnigan Knowles.

“Okay you weren’t kidding when you said you were going all out.”

He gave Zoey a devilish smirk and exclaimed, “Alright bitches—or Zoey—let’s kick this shit up!”

1k4w93r,https://www.dailymicrofiction.com/p/an-abundance-of-yimbyfic,An Abundance of YIMBYfic,"The Oakhaven Community Hall’s fluorescent lights flickered almost imperceptibly, casting a sallow, buzzing pallor that leeched the vibrancy from Anya Sharma’s carefully rendered drawings of Sycamore Commons. The air hung heavy with the faint, clinging aroma of decades of stale coffee and industrial-strength cleaner. Anya smoothed her notes, the paper crisp under her fingers, a stark contrast to the room’s weary atmosphere. Thirty affordable homes. Solar panels. Rain gardens. Needed. Possible.


""...Sycamore Commons offers a path toward sustainable, community-focused living,"" Anya concluded, her voice steady despite the hollow echo in the room. She scanned the faces – a retired couple, a young man scrolling on his phone, and the inevitable sentinels: Arthur Pendelton and Beatrice Holloway.

Arthur rose, adjusting the knot of his tie. ""Ms. Sharma,"" he began, his voice measured, ""a polished presentation. However, it seems to skim over certain... foundational Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions. Section 14-B, the '78 FAR limitations, are quite clear. And let's not forget the '92 amendment regarding setbacks, which seems at odds with your proposed northern elevation."" He tapped a leather-bound binder. ""These frameworks weren't arbitrary. They were implemented, piece by painstaking piece, to ensure Oakhaven retains its unique character and, frankly, its property values.""

""Mr. Pendelton,"" Anya countered, keeping her tone even, ""the Master Plan encourages density here. The '78 code targeted industrial risks that vanished decades ago. The '92 setback amendment..."" She trailed off, realizing the futility. It wasn't about logic; it was about leveraging layers of accumulated text.

Beatrice Holloway leaned forward, her brow furrowed with genuine concern. ""And the runoff mitigation,"" she pressed, her voice earnest. ""The plans mention bioswales, yes, but after Meadow Creek back in '98 – remember how choked it got? Dead fish everywhere downstream, all from the golf course runoff – we have to be exceedingly cautious. Have you truly modeled the impact on potential amphibian habitats, considering the soil compaction from construction?""

Anya took a slow breath. Meadow Creek was miles away, the cause entirely different, the soil here nothing alike. Yet Beatrice wasn’t just being difficult; she was haunted by a past failure, overlaying its ghost onto this unrelated project. Anya felt a flicker of despair, the first chill of absurdity. Rules meant to protect rivers from fertilizer were being invoked to question housing during a crisis. The meeting adjourned under a cloud of newly required studies and reviews.

Time warped in the Planning Department. Days dissolved into weeks marked by the rhythm of submission, rejection, and revision. Anya’s desk became an archaeological dig site layered with permits, reports, and contradictory emails. One Monday, a thick packet arrived via interoffice mail: Historical Preservation now required photographic documentation of the ""extant sidewalk infrastructure"" (cracked concrete from the 1960s) before approving curb cuts needed by Transportation, which itself was holding approval pending revised wind-load calculations for the solar panels requested by Zoning after Arthur cited a 1985 ordinance about ""visual harmony.""

She found herself waiting on a hard plastic chair outside Mr. Henderson’s office. On the corner of his desk, visible through the glass partition, sat another thick file labeled ""Oakhaven Community Solar Initiative - Phase 1 - PENDING REVIEW."" Clearly, Sycamore Commons wasn't the only hopeful project trapped in this amber. When Henderson finally waved her in, the air was thick with the smell of aging paper and toner dust. An ancient dot-matrix printer grumbled sporadically in the corner.

""Sycamore Commons,"" Henderson sighed, lifting the hefty file as if it physically pained him. He flipped through pages brittle with age. ""Right. We've got the nocturnal bat assessment back, looks fine. But,"" he peered over his glasses, ""the '94 Environmental Impact Checklist – triggered because the site is within 500 yards of a designated floodplain, remember – requires cross-referencing the soil displacement against the migratory bird nesting timelines outlined in the '03 Wildlife Protection Addendum. So, we'll need that supplemental report before...""

""Mr. Henderson,"" Anya interrupted, her voice tight. She could feel the imprint of her pen where she gripped it. ""We addressed migratory birds in the primary environmental assessment. This is redundant. We need to grade the site before the fall rains, or we lose the entire season, maybe the financing."" On her phone screen, a news alert flashed: City Rents Hit Record High.

Henderson ran a hand over his tired eyes. ""Ms. Sharma, I understand your frustration. Believe me,"" he gestured helplessly at the stacks around him, monuments to stalled intentions. ""But the procedures are sequential. Mandatory. Layer upon layer. They exist to prevent... well, to prevent things."" He trailed off, the original purpose lost somewhere in the bureaucratic maze. ""My signature requires the checkmarks. And the checkmarks require the reports."" He sounded less like an official, more like a prisoner reading the terms of his own sentence.

The Planning Commission hearing was pure theater of the weary. Speaker after speaker approached the microphone, their voices echoing slightly in the stuffy room. Arthur spoke eloquently of ""preserving the delicate balance."" Beatrice presented blurry photos of generic birds, warning of displacement. Others lamented shadows, parking, the sheer newness of it all. Anya listened, her meticulously prepared counter-arguments feeling like trying to drain a swamp with a teaspoon. Inside, she screamed: People are sleeping in cars! We need homes! This building is greener than 90% of the houses you live in! But outside, she presented data, charts, mitigation plans.

The commissioners’ faces were impassive masks of civic duty. Their questions were procedural, careful, designed not to solve the problem but to navigate the intricate web of rules without getting snagged. The project wasn't denied, merely… deferred. Pending further review.

Outside, under a sky the color of bruised plums, Leo Maxwell leaned against a brick wall, smoke curling from his cigarette. ""Saw that comin' a mile off,"" he said, not unkindly.

""They didn't even really discuss the housing,"" Anya choked out, the frustration finally cracking her composure. ""It was all process. Procedure. Using rules for things they were never meant for.""

Leo took a slow drag. ""Yep. This system,"" he gestured vaguely at City Hall, ""it ain't built to say 'yes,' kid. It's built to make 'yes' so damn hard it might as well be impossible. Designed for blockin', not buildin'. Playin' by these rules?"" He gave a short, harsh laugh. ""That's how you lose before you even start. You wanna build somethin'? You gotta flip the whole damn table, not just rearrange the cards they dealt ya.""

The final straw arrived a week later, thin and innocuous in its official envelope. 'Request for Further Clarification: Assessment of Potential Vibration Impacts on Adjacent Municipal Sewer Lines (Circa 1955) During Proposed Foundation Work.' It was utterly tangential, technically complex enough to require weeks of new engineering studies, and almost certainly fatal to the project's timeline and budget.

Anya stared at the letter, her vision blurring. The weight of it all – the months, the revisions, the meetings, the sheer, grinding absurdity – pressed down on her. She felt the familiar undertow of despair pulling her towards simply giving up.

Then, Leo’s blunt words cut through the fog: Flip the whole damn table.

A switch flipped. Not defeat, but cold, energizing fury. She took the offending letter. She didn't file it. She didn't shred it. She walked deliberately to the recycling bin beside her desk and dropped it in. It landed with a soft, satisfying thud.

She turned back to her desk. She pushed aside the meticulously organized binders for Sycamore Commons, the stacks of unanswered bureaucratic demands. Her hand reached, not for an engineer’s contact, but for a fresh legal pad. The pen felt solid in her grip. At the top, she wrote: 'Oakhaven Regulatory Reform Initiative.' Her first bullet point wasn’t about soil mechanics or sewer lines. It was: 'Identify and target conflicting/obsolete zoning ordinances for repeal.' Her gaze lifted from the pad, past the rendering of the unbuilt Sycamore Commons, towards the city map pinned above her desk. She saw not just one blocked project, but a sprawling network of invisible, time-worn barriers. The task wasn't just to build one building anymore. It was to clear the path so building itself could happen again.

1k4w7j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1k4w7j0/brewed_hearts/,Brewed hearts,"“Brewed Hearts”

Leslie owned Second Cup Café, a cozy little spot where the scent of dark roast mingled with the sound of old love songs. It was her world warm, steady, safe. One rainy Tuesday, Ricardo walked in, scrub top damp from the weather, looking like he hadn’t slept in days. A surgical tech with tired hands but a curious heart.

That first cup led to another. And another. Over time, their conversations drifted from casual to deep. They’d talk about everything broken families, secret dreams, the kind of love that hurts in the best way. At first, they were just two people who liked coffee and good music. But something was different.

It started with long nights of texting tiny confessions sent in the quiet hours. Lyrics shared back and forth. “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” “Let’s Stay Together.” Love songs that made their way into the café playlist, then into their hearts.

They told each other I love you before they ever touched. It wasn’t even about the physical at first it was a love that grew slowly, silently, like a seed planted in the cracks of friendship.

For ten years, they circled each other. Best friends who knew too much. They had inside jokes, memories, scars. Everyone thought they were together. Maybe they already were, just without the title.

And then it happened one night, no barriers left, just wine and love songs humming low. They kissed like they had been waiting their whole lives for that moment. And everything changed.

It was beautiful, at first. Mornings together before shifts. Love notes on coffee sleeves. Texts that said “I miss you already” even after spending the night. A decade of emotion finally allowed to breathe.

But love, when it’s built on years of restraint, can crack under the weight of expectation. She wanted forever in the café, in the life they built. He was restless, scared, unsure how to turn friendship into permanence.

They started fighting over little things. Texts stopped being sweet. The music in the café felt too loud, too nostalgic. They both wanted it to work, but the timing after all those years still wasn’t right.

One morning, his coffee was left untouched on the counter. He didn’t show up. Not that day, or the next.

She didn’t change the playlist.

He never blocked her number.

But sometimes, even the strongest love can’t survive its own history

Part 2: The Lyrics and the Sweetness

A year passed.

The café stayed open, but Leslie kept part of herself closed. She still played the old love songs her regulars thought it was just her vibe, but really, it was memory. Every track reminded her of him. Of late-night texts, shared playlists, whispered I love yous that never had a safe place to land.

Ricardo? He buried himself in work. Surgical suites, long shifts, silent rides home. He pretended he was fine, but certain songs,certain silences,still wrecked him. He missed her voice, her coffee, her way of saying read the lyrics like they were gospel.

Then came the flyer:
Espresso Art & Music Nights: Create. Sip. Listen.

She found it on a community board. He saw it near the hospital elevators.

Of course they both signed up.

And of course, life sat them side by side.

The instructor asked each person to choose a song while they learned to swirl espresso and milk into art. It was meant to set the mood make the hands feel what the heart heard.

Leslie picked “Neon Moon” by Brooks & Dunn.

When the opening chords played, she didn’t look at him right away. But when she did, his eyes were already on her.

“You would,” he said softly, teasing but full of something tender.

She smiled. “It still hurts good.”

Then Ricardo picked “Strawberry Hills” by Nige.

It hit different,slow, raw, aching in a way only real things can. She turned to him, surprised. He always leaned more soulful than sentimental.

“That one’s been on repeat,” he said. “You’d like the lyrics.”

She didn’t say anything. Just nodded. Because she already knew she would.

As they poured and swirled, their hands moving without thinking, old feelings poured up from the cracks. It wasn’t instant forgiveness. It wasn’t all perfect. But it was real.

“Read the lyrics Ricardo” she said, voice low.

Ricardo looked at her, his grin half-smile, half-confession. “Only if you tell me something sweet.”

She didn’t answer. She just leaned into the moment.

They stayed until the lights dimmed and the music faded. Left together, quiet but full.

This time, there were no promises. Just her hand brushing his. Just the music between them.

Because sometimes love doesn’t need fixing.
Sometimes, it just needs time and the right song.

Part 3: The Second Pour

“You scared?” she asked quietly.

“Terrified,” he said. “But I’m here.”

And maybe that’s what mattered most.

Not promises. Not perfect timing. Just presence.

They didn’t call it a new beginning. They didn’t call it anything.

They just kept showing up, one cup, one song, one slow dance at a time.

Because sometimes, love isn’t brewed all at once.

Sometimes, it needs a second pour.

For weeks, they found their rhythm in the quiet corners of the café. Sunday mornings over blueberry scones. Tuesday closings where she’d let him flip the sign to closed just so they could sit in silence. No labels. No pressure. Just whatever this was soft, safe, slow.

He started keeping a mug there. A chipped one with a faded design she once called “ugly in a charming way.” She never washed it unless he missed two visits. He never did.

Until one day… he just didn’t show up.

No call. No message. No hospital flyer pulled from the board. Just silence.

She brewed his usual anyway. Left the mug on the counter. Waited past close. Told herself he probably got stuck in a late shift. Or maybe he overslept. Or maybe!

Days passed. Then a week. Then two.

His mug stayed untouched. Her playlist grew quieter. No “Strawberry Hills.” No jazz. Just the hum of the espresso machine and the weight of wondering.

She didn’t go looking for him.

Pride? Maybe. Fear? Probably. But mostly, she knew if he was meant to be there, he would be.

Still, every time the door chimed, she looked up.

Just in case.

It wasn’t heartbreak, not exactly. It was emptiness shaped like a person who once stayed late to clean tables he didn’t work at. Someone who remembered her favorite bridge in every song.

She didn’t stop playing music. She didn’t stop serving coffee. But she did stop waiting.

Love, she realized, isn’t always lost with a goodbye. Sometimes it’s lost with silence.

What about membership offerings at supermarkets such as Coop medlem? Do they also require one or the other?",1,1745290331.0,Norway,3,1.0,False
1k4w0f3,https://i.redd.it/62c9q1o1uawe1.jpeg,Packed Light for a 5-Day Work Trip – What Should I Do Differently Next Time?,"I've been so inspired by the posts in this sub! I usually travel with a 21"" suitcase and a personal item, but this community motivated me to be more intentional and efficient with my packing.

A recent travel mishap pushed me to make the leap: I had to gate-check my wheeled carry-on, got stuck overnight in another city, and didn’t have access to my bag. Never again.

A bit about my travel style: I work remotely and most of my trips are for work. I'm often sprinting through airports with layovers, and I *must* have a spinner bag—it stands up on its own, doubles as a footrest, and just works better for me than a backpack. That said, I do carry a \~22L company-branded Patagonia backpack with a laptop sleeve when I travel to the office.

For this trip, I challenged myself: I bought the [Samsonite Spinner Underseater](https://shop.samsonite.com/luggage/underseat-luggage/spinner-underseater-with-usb-port/1129341041.html?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADLfGmu4DrdCep0yDHhK7EUxyn5UP&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2ZfABhDBARIsAHFTxGzJzHz6fP2-TrzBODv-Jufy2emKPw9nwNKNcggOoRLeErHoNsrzxQwaAmAgEALw_wcB) and aimed to pack more intentionally. This was my first trip where I *really* planned out what I brought and to my delight, people in the office were shocked at how little I packed. And yet… I still feel like I could do better!

I’d love to hear your feedback on how I could improve next time.

**Trip Details**  
**Destination:** Midwest  
**Purpose:** Work – All Staff Retreat (casual office, all-day meetings, evening socializing, volunteering)  
**Weather:** Mid 40s to high 60s F, possible rain

**Outfits & Activities**

* **Day 1 (Travel + Half-Day in Office)** Black tank, denim button-up, black jeans, rain jacket, sneakers
* **Day 2 (Office + Volunteering + Socializing)** Team t-shirt (pic is representation, didn't want to include work logo), black denim, change into athletic pants for volunteering (easy to get dirty), sneakers, plaid button-up
* **Day 3 (Full Day Meetings + Workshop + Socializing)** Black sweater, blue jeans, blue flats
* **Day 4 (All Day Meetings)** Floral blouse, blue jeans, blue flats
* **Day 5 (Travel Home = No One to Impress)** Whatever still feels clean and comfy

**Not Pictured**

* Sleep dress
* 3 socks (1 pair worn Day 1)
* 5 underwear
* 2 bras (1 sports bra worn Day 1, 1 packed)
* Bathing suit (coworker said the hotel had a nice hot tub/pool)
* Rain jacket with removable inner vest (worn)
* Despite cutting my usual packing space by a third (or maybe even half), I was surprised how many “luxuries” I still fit:

   * Revlon hot air brush (we were doing staff headshots, such a luxury item)
   * Eye mask (first flight out had a 5:20 AM boarding time)
   * Water bottle
   * [Travel coffee mug](https://www.miir.com/products/flip-traveler?variant=40344621744202)
* In Backpack: 
   * Toiletries
   * Tech: Laptop, laptop charger, mouse, phone charger, plug in headphones, air pods
   * Snacks (apple, packet sunbutter, 2 chomps, gum)
   * Water bottle and travel mugs were in side pockets. 

**My Initial Thoughts (Just got in today!)**

* Looking forward to ditching the work backpack. It feels *too big*. If I packed even lighter, I think I could fit my laptop in the middle sleeve of the spinner and bring a packable tote instead.
* I need options for work-appropriate ""soft pants"" This sub has a lot of great recommendations I've been reviewing. 
* I need a better light layer. Debating between a wool cardigan, travel-friendly blazer, solid flannel, or something like the R1 jacket. Same, the sub has a lot of suggestions! If it was more jacket-like, I would not have packed the denim button up, plaid button up, and the 'athletic' long sleeve layer.  
* Just needed 1 tank. Probably didn't need blue long sleeve at all, but it is nice to cover up when going to workout. 
* I wish the work activities were spaced differently so I wasn't wearing the same bottom half on Mon/Tue and Wed/Thur. 

Would love to hear your thoughts—what would you keep, cut, or swap for next time?",4,1745290297.0,HerOneBag,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the KIA Tigers versus the Samsung Lions—a matchup as classic as peanut butter and jelly, or in this case, kimchi and rice. The Tigers are eagerly awaiting the return of their prodigal son, Kim Do-young, whose absence has been felt like a missing sock in a laundry load. With the team batting a paltry .239, it's clear they've been swinging more like kittens than Tigers.

Kim's return is expected to inject some much-needed adrenaline into the Tigers' lineup, and not a moment too soon. The Tigers are sitting at 6th place with an 11-12 record, which is about as comforting as a lukewarm cup of coffee. But fear not, Tigers fans, for Kim's return is imminent, and with it, the promise of a revitalized offense.

Now, let's talk odds. The Samsung Lions are the favorites here, with odds of 1.67 at Bovada, while the Tigers are the underdogs at 2.15. Given the Tigers' current form, it's no surprise the Lions are favored. However, if you're feeling adventurous and have a penchant for underdog stories, placing a bet on the Tigers could be your ticket to glory—or at least a decent payout.

For those who prefer a more conservative approach, the spread has the Tigers at +1.5 with odds of 1.61. This might be the safer bet if you believe Kim's return will at least keep the game close.

As for the total, the line is set at 11.0, and with Kim's return potentially sparking the Tigers' offense, the ""Over"" at 1.8 might just be the way to go. After all, nothing says ""welcome back"" quite like a high-scoring affair.

In summary, if you're feeling lucky and believe in the power of a comeback, take the Tigers at 2.15. If you're more of a cautious cat, consider the spread or the over. Either way, grab your popcorn, because this game promises to be as thrilling as a K-drama finale.

I just finished my undergrad and I wanted to share my #1 tip 

SLEEP

I can confidently say I never suffered severe burn out during my undergrad and ended up with a decent 3.86 GPA 3.75sGPA. In highschool I swore that I did my best late at night. This was only because I was forcing myself to be at an optimal level of stress where I had no choice but to stay up and get my work done. 

My habits changed when I started working 32-40 hours a week and filled my schedule leaving minimal time to study so I had to learn how to manage my time. 

I never allowed myself to study past 11pm and I never studied at home unless I had to. The latest coffee shop/library in my area was open till 11 which meant I closed at 11. 

My last few hours of studying was spent reading, taking light notes, or doing flash cards. Any hard core stuff that required focus I did earlier in the day. This allowed me to destress and start my bed time routine. 

I usually tired to be home by 11 rather than leave at 11 so I could shower and chill out. 

I only spent 1 or 2 nights a semester staying up cramming or finishing a project. 

I would get up and study early (6am) AWAY from home so I wasn’t tempted to go back to bed which is only horrible if you don’t have a regular sleep schedule. 

I successfully got 6-8 hours each night and I SWEAR it’s the only thing that kept me sane. Take care of yourself!

The entire planet is a living office, populated mostly by clones of intern John Oaf, who has already been dead for 150 years. He was selected as the cloning template because he spilled coffee on the visiting CEO of the time on a branch office world.

His memories were modified to serve as a perfect cookie cutter template for customer service. Clones are used instead of machine intelligences due to costs and the customer demand for a ""human"" element.

All office spaces and cubicles are air conditioned, which supplies aerosolized caffeine to make the Johns more efficient. Johns are given 7 hours of sleep everyday to ensure peak efficiency during the other 17 hours of work. They sleep in pods next to their office spaces, where nitrous oxide is used as a sedative to force them to sleep, even under the effects of caffeine.

During the cloning process, all Johns are implanted with the modified memories and a nutrient and waste tank, removing the need to eat, drink, or take bathroom breaks. The tanks are cleared and refilled each time in the sleeping pods. Vitamin B12 is also administered in sleeping pods to reduce wear and tear from nitrous oxide use, however, the wear and tear is inevitable, and clones will eventually lose mental capacity, reducing their efficiency.

Johns vary in lifespan due to variations in the cloning process. Some clones are more stable, resistant to nitrous oxide poisoning and age less, increasing their operational life to a decade or more. Some clones can also become ""disagreeable"". These clones are taken away and dissolved, their organic matter to be recycled into new Johns. The average John has a service life of about 6 years and are all recycled once they are no longer efficient employees.

**The condition:** Everything you eat from here until the end of your life must be from a McDonald's. Everything you drink (aside from a couple of exemptions - see below) must also be from a McDonald's. 

**Additional Details:** You have a free pass to take the McDonald's food anywhere: sports stadiums, movie theaters, other restaurants, airplanes, etc - these establishments will allow you to bring it in with you even if they have policies against such things normally. So if you are having a date with a spouse or friends, you can still go to dinner with them, but you'll need to stop by a McDonald's (or have someone pick it up for you) beforehand and take the food in with you (or, simply not eat).

**Liquids:** Most liquids are included in this rule, with two exceptions: 1) Water and 2) Alcohol-based drinks (beer, wine, spirits, mead, hard seltzers) are exempt from the rule. So you can still get your water from anywhere and you can still consume any alcohol-based drink. But every other liquid: juice, coffee, smoothies, milkshakes, etc must be purchased from a McDonalds. 

**Violation:** If you violate the rule, you will be killed immediately. Say you're at a cocktail party and have a brain fart for a moment, or maybe you had too much to drink, and you decide to take a bite of the food at the party - you will be killed immediately. 

**Things to consider:**

\- In the unlikely event that McDonald's goes out of business in your lifetime, you're SOL and will starve to death.

\- Travel - you will need to ensure that any country you travel to has McDonald's locations that are easily accessible, or just plan on not eating for the entirety of the trip (humans can survive surprisingly long without food, but it will be difficult). 

\- Given that you are now a billionaire, you should have ample resources to have a delivery driver at your disposal 24/7 that can bring you food from McDonald's at any time, no matter where you are (assuming you are close-ish to a McDonald's location)

\- McDonald's has heart-healthy options (ie salads), but there will still be adverse health effects from eating fast food every day - on the other hand, you will have access to the best healthcare money can buy.

So are you taking the $1 Billion and eating McD's for the rest of your life?",44,1745289571.0,hypotheticalsituation,91,0.85,False

Photo is a statue of ganesha on his back is this flower. 
And a sip of a coffee that looked like the millenium falcon.
Millenium falcon should be enough to prove there is meaning, but.

Why is nothing?
It is the space between the atoms, the space where magnetisim flows, 
Push and pull, mystery. 
What is life without mystery, 
The mystery is Love.
The seperation, that without there is only nothing, 
But seperation is, 
Love is.

Meaningless and meaning, 
Light divided by darkness.
there is nothing. It exists. 
But whats on the otherside. 
A meaningful quest.
And if its a meaningful quest then it isnt nothing, 
Its the warp, 
The aether. Beware. But not afraid.

The challenge of being alive is generating meaning in the meaningless, its ideal when your raised into a society with sufficent truth and challenge and purpose that you dont really need to contemplate it.

But we live in an age where meaning has a question mark next to it, the one thing all questions share, a question mark, the space between the curve and the dot. Bridge it, will you ever reach the dot? If you are charging toward it carrying your cross, you have already reached it. Reaching it is the movement towards it.

God is real, and he loves you. 
And thats terrifying, 
Nihilisim is your shield.

You are made up of atoms with space inbetween aswell, 
Your portion of love.

Get your infinity suit on.

We live in infinity.

Light a fire in nothing, 
You are at the stage of life to face the nothingness.
And create meaning in it. 

Charge headfirst into oblivion, why?
Why the heck not,
But also make your meaning line up with the reality you live amongst.

The boiler is a unique HX (that runs more like a dual boiler) made of stainless with brass endplates. The images are of the steam chamber, the coffee boiler is beneath. You can see the bottom looks to have gold hues in certain places, I'm wondering if it's coated brass that is wearing off. 

Anyway, thoughts on what I should do? Replace the element, replace the boiler because of exposed brass in contact with water? Nothing?

1k4vp5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/JointPain101/comments/1k4vp5a/how_to_use_avocado_seed_for_joint_pain/,How To Use Avocado Seed For Joint Pain,"How to Use Avocado Seed for Joint Pain: Effective Methods and Benefits
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Joint pain is a common problem affecting millions worldwide, often caused by arthritis, injury, or inflammation. Many people look for natural remedies that provide relief without harsh chemicals or side effects. One surprising yet effective solution comes from an unexpected source: the avocado seed. While most people discard this part of the fruit, avocado seed contains beneficial compounds that can help reduce joint discomfort and improve mobility.

### Why Avocado Seed Helps with Joint Pain

The avocado seed is rich in antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and essential nutrients. These elements work together to fight inflammation and support joint health. Inflammation is a primary cause of pain and stiffness in joints, so reducing it can provide significant relief. Additionally, avocado seeds contain fiber and phytochemicals such as flavonoids and phenolic compounds that promote overall wellbeing and cellular repair.

Scientific studies have shown that extracts from avocado seed can inhibit inflammatory pathways and reduce oxidative stress in the body. Oxidative stress damages joint cartilage and tissues, accelerating joint issues like osteoarthritis. By protecting cells from this damage, avocado seed helps maintain joint structure and function.

### Preparing Avocado Seed for Use

To use avocado seed for joint pain, it needs to be prepared properly to extract the beneficial compounds. Follow these steps to make an effective avocado seed remedy:

1. **Remove and Clean the Seed:** After eating the avocado, take out the seed and wash it thoroughly to remove any fruit residue.
2. **Dry the Seed:** Let the seed dry for a few days in a cool, dry place. This makes it easier to grind.
3. **Remove the Outer Skin:** The seed has a thin brown skin that can be peeled off once dried to improve taste and texture.
4. **Grind into Powder:** Use a blender, coffee grinder, or food processor to crush the dried seed into a fine powder.
 
The powder can be stored in an airtight container for future use.

### Effective Ways to Use Avocado Seed for Joint Relief

There are several ways to incorporate avocado seed into your wellness routine. Here are the most popular and effective methods:

#### 1. Avocado Seed Tea

One of the easiest ways to use avocado seed for joint pain is by brewing a herbal tea. The warm tea helps soothe inflamed joints and lets your body absorb the antioxidants.

- Boil 1 to 2 teaspoons of avocado seed powder in 2 cups of water.
- Simmer for 10-15 minutes, then strain the mixture.
- Drink this tea once or twice daily for best results.
 
#### 2. Avocado Seed Smoothie Booster

Adding avocado seed powder to your smoothie is a nutritious way to support joint health while enjoying your favorite drink.

- Add 1 teaspoon of avocado seed powder to your morning smoothie.
- Blend with fruits, leafy greens, and a liquid base such as almond milk or water.
- Consume regularly to benefit from its anti-inflammatory properties.
 
#### 3. Topical Avocado Seed Paste

For targeted joint pain relief, you can make a paste from avocado seed powder to apply directly on the affected area.

- Mix avocado seed powder with a small amount of water or coconut oil to form a thick paste.
- Gently rub the paste onto painful joints.
- Leave it on for 20-30 minutes and then rinse off.
- Repeat this process 2-3 times a week for noticeable improvements.
 
### Additional Tips to Maximize Benefits

To get the most out of using avocado seed for joint pain, consider combining it with a healthy lifestyle:

- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to help flush toxins and support joint lubrication.
- **Maintain a Balanced Diet:** Include anti-inflammatory foods like turmeric, ginger, fatty fish, and leafy greens.
- **Exercise Regularly:** Low-impact activities such as swimming, walking, or yoga enhance joint mobility and reduce stiffness.
- **Avoid Excessive Strain:** Protect your joints from overuse or injury by using proper posture and supportive footwear.
 
### Precautions When Using Avocado Seed

Although avocado seeds are natural, it’s important to use them safely:

- **Start Small:** Begin with small amounts to see how your body reacts.
- **Consult a Doctor:** Especially if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or on medication.
- **Use Clean Seeds:** Always use seeds from ripe, fresh avocados to avoid contaminants.
 
Avocado seed into your joint pain relief regimen can be a simple and cost-effective natural approach. With its rich anti-inflammatory and antioxidant content, this overlooked part of the avocado offers promising benefits. By preparing it correctly and using it consistently, you may experience reduced pain and increased joint comfort over time.

</div>Understanding the Nutritional Components of Avocado Seed That Aid Joint Health
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>The avocado seed, often discarded, is a powerhouse of nutrients that can be surprisingly beneficial for joint health. While many focus on the creamy flesh of the avocado, the seed contains a variety of compounds that may help reduce inflammation and support joint function. Understanding these nutritional components helps you appreciate the potential of avocado seeds in managing joint pain and promoting overall joint wellness.

### Rich in Antioxidants

One of the key reasons avocado seeds support joint health is their high antioxidant content. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals—unstable molecules that cause oxidative stress and contribute to inflammation in joints. By reducing oxidative damage, antioxidants play a crucial role in decreasing swelling and pain associated with conditions like arthritis.

Avocado seeds contain phenolic compounds and flavonoids, both powerful antioxidants that protect joint tissues from damage. Including these antioxidants in your diet can help slow down joint degeneration and improve mobility.

### Abundant in Fiber

Fiber in avocado seeds is another important component that indirectly benefits joint health. A high-fiber diet supports gut health by promoting a healthy balance of gut bacteria. Research suggests a strong link between gut health and inflammation; when your gut is healthy, the immune system functions better, potentially reducing autoimmune joint conditions.

- **Soluble fiber:** Slows digestion, helping control blood sugar levels, which is important to prevent inflammation spikes.
- **Insoluble fiber:** Aids in regular bowel movements, ensuring toxin elimination and reducing their build-up in joints.
 
Adding avocado seed powder or extracts to your meals can increase your daily fiber intake, supporting your body's natural ability to fight inflammation.

### Beneficial Fatty Acids

While the seed is not as fatty as the avocado flesh, it still contains trace amounts of healthy fats like monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). These fats help reduce inflammation in the body, which directly benefits joints. MUFAs contribute to lowering levels of pro-inflammatory molecules, thereby easing joint pain and stiffness.

Regular consumption of nutrients from avocado seeds alongside whole avocado can provide a balanced intake of anti-inflammatory fats and essential nutrients for joint care.

### Presence of Essential Micronutrients

Micronutrients such as magnesium, calcium, and potassium present in avocado seeds are essential for maintaining healthy joints and bones. Here's why they matter:

- **Magnesium:** Plays a key role in muscle relaxation and reducing cramps around the joints.
- **Calcium:** Important for maintaining strong bones that support joints.
- **Potassium:** Helps regulate fluid balance and prevent joint swelling.
 
By incorporating avocado seed into your routine, you naturally boost your intake of these minerals, assisting in joint strength and flexibility.

### Anti-inflammatory Plant Compounds

Avocado seeds are rich in unique plant compounds such as tannins and alkaloids, which have natural anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds help reduce joint inflammation by inhibiting enzymes that contribute to swelling and pain. Their natural origin means fewer side effects compared to synthetic medications.

Using avocado seed extracts or powders can be a safe, complementary approach to managing inflammation from joint disorders such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

### How to Utilize Avocado Seed for Joint Health

To benefit from the nutritional components of avocado seed, here are some practical ways to use it:

- **Dry and grind:** Remove the seed, dry it thoroughly, and grind into powder. This powder can be added to smoothies, soups, or teas.
- **Make tea:** Boil crushed avocado seeds in water for 10-15 minutes. Strain and drink the tea daily to receive anti-inflammatory benefits.
- **Use in supplements:** Some companies produce avocado seed extract supplements specifically aimed at supporting joint health.
 
When incorporating avocado seed into your diet, start with small amounts to assess tolerance. Always consult with a healthcare provider if you have any underlying health conditions or are on medication.

Understanding the nutritional richness of avocado seeds reveals why they can be a valuable natural aid for joint health. Their antioxidant, fiber, fatty acid, mineral, and anti-inflammatory properties collectively work to reduce joint pain and improve mobility—making avocado seed a worthy addition to your joint care regimen.

</div>### Conclusion

Using avocado seed for joint pain offers a natural and accessible way to support your joint health. By incorporating methods like making avocado seed powder or a soothing tea, you can tap into the seed’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These methods are simple to prepare and can be easily included in your daily routine, providing relief from stiffness and discomfort associated with joint pain.

The key to avocado seed’s effectiveness lies in its rich nutritional profile. It contains compounds such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and dietary fiber, which work together to reduce inflammation and protect the cartilage that cushions your joints. These nutrients help improve mobility and may contribute to long-term joint health by slowing down the wear and tear caused by conditions like arthritis.

When you choose to use avocado seed as a natural remedy, you are opting for a holistic approach that complements traditional treatments. As with any health practice, consistency matters, so regular use can enhance the benefits and support your overall joint well-being. Always remember to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement, especially if you have existing health conditions.

By utilizing the avocado seed’s powerful nutrients and easy-to-follow preparation methods, you give yourself a natural edge in managing joint pain. This simple addition to your wellness routine could help reduce discomfort and improve the quality of your movements, letting you enjoy daily activities with greater ease and comfort.",1,1745289304.0,JointPain101,0,1.0,False

It’s gonna be largely obvious to you if you already now why AI agents are much more capable than Zapier.

You need a perfect cup of coffee—right now. Do you press a pod machine or call a 20‑year barista who can craft anything from a warehouse of beans and syrups? Today’s automation developers face the same choice.

Zapier and the like are so huge and dominant in the RPA/automation industry because they absolutely nailed deterministic workflows—very well defined workflows with if-then logic. Sure they can inject some reasoning into those workflows by putting an LLM at some point to pick between branches of a decision tree or produce a ""tailored"" output like a personalized email. However, there's still a world of automation that's untouched and hence the hundreds of millions of people doing routine office work: the world of dynamic workflows.

Dynamic workflows require creativity and reasoning such that when given a set of inputs and a broadly defined objective, they require using whatever relevant tools available in the digital world—including making several decisions about the best way to achieve said objective along the way. This requires research, synthesizing ideas, adapting to new information, and the ability to use different software tools/applications on a computer/the internet. This is territory Zapier and co can never dream of touching with their current set of technologies. This is where AI comes in.

LLMs are gaining increasingly ridiculous amounts of intelligence, but they don't have the tooling to interact with software systems/applications in real world. That's why MCP (Model context protocol, an emerging spec that lets LLMs call app‑level actions) is so hot these days. MCP gives LLMs some tooling to interact with whichever software applications support these MCP integrations. Essentially a Zapier-like framework but on steroids. The real question is what would it look like if AI could go even further?

Top tier automation means interacting with all the software systems/applications in the accessible digital world the same way a human could, but being able to operate 24/7 x 365 with zero loss in focus or efficiency. The final prerequisite is the intelligence/alignment needs to be up to par. This notion currently leads the R&D race among big AI labs like OpenAI, Anthropic, ByteDance, etc. to produce AI that can use computers like we can: Computer-Use Agents.

OpenAI's computer-use/Anthropic's computer-use are a solid proof of concept but they fall short due to hallucinations or getting confused by unexpected pop-ups/complex screens. However, if they continue to iterate and improve in intelligence, we're talking about unprecedented quantities of human capital replacement. A highly intelligent technology capable of booting up a computer and having access to all the software/applications/information available to us throughout the internet is the first step to producing next level human-replacing automations.

Although these computer use models are not the best right now, there's probably already a solid set of use cases in which they are very much production ready. It's only a matter of time before people figure out how to channel this new AI breakthrough into multi-industry changing technologies. After a couple iterations of high magnitude improvements to these models, say hello to a brand new world where developers can easily build huge teams of veteran baristas with unlimited access to the best beans and syrups.",1,1745288913.0,ComputerAgents,0,1.0,False
1k4vke2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1k4vke2/aio_gf_went_on_coffee_date_with_guy_friend/,"AIO ? GF went on coffee ""date"" with guy friend","Hey everyone ! I never thought i would ever do a post on this sub reddit since so far i always manged on my own by talking to my partner and having and open minded conversation but i really need a third opionon on this so see if im either just overreacting/overthinking this whole thing. (Sorry for some grammar mistakes im advance, english is not my first language)

So a bit of back story: I (28) have been with my girlfriend (24) for a bit over 1 year. Everything has been going great and we both harmonize really well. She had previous situationships but acccodring to her im her first real boyfriend. I on the other hand had a few serious releationship before her, including one where i got cheated on. I was 19 when this happend and even though it was nothing major and i didnd get any ""trauma from it, it still made me a bit wary of certain things.

We both meet at eachother at my old working place, she was a cook and i was working at the front (yes i know very cliché). Working in a male dominated business and her being an attractive woman its not umsual for her to get hit on often. I trust my girlfriend and in my opinion i dont see any harm in a little bit of banter between the opposite sex or her having several guy friends, as long as it stays in line and i expext her to be open about it, meaning its ok to meet other guys or have other guy friends but i expext her to be open and honest about them. So here come the problem where im not quite sure what to do with myself. 

She uses Snapchat, which i admit i have some wierd feelings about but that might just be me being old and out of date. Early on the in the relationship i ""caught"" her sending a dude selfie while she was at my house and she was only wearing a towel after the shower. I instantyl confronted her and told her that im not okey with that, she apologized and i do believe her that it was more of a in the moment snap and it wasnt ment to be seductive. However what bothered me more about this situation is not the picture itself but that she mentioned a name which i have never heard before. As mentioned im fine her having guy friends but i think its fair that i at least know a little bit who they are or know their name. That whole situation passed with no harsh feelings since people do make mistakes and im not perfect either.

I have to add our releationship is otherwise going great. I really do believe thay she loves me and i love her as well but small things like that snapchat situation and other smaller things sometimes just leave a bit of a bitter taste.

Fast forward to yesterday, we had a random conversation where i said something about about trust and for some reason that made her confess that about two weeks ago she went to grab a drink with a guy, who she worked with and when she was on the way home he texted her saying something along the lines of ""if she didnt have a bf, he would have definitely asked her out and tried something"" he deleted the message but my gf saw it and responded saying that because of that she cant be friends with him.
My problem here is not that she went out to drink something with another dude but again that it is name which i have never heaerd before as well as that she didnt tell me when this happened. Additonally she didnt block him even after him.confessing this but only did so when he started liking vacation picture of her and i, since she said she found it creepy that he only likes picture where im on it. 

When she told me this yesterday i didnt really say much since i was kinda caught off guard, i managed to say that she knows where her boundaries are and i expexct her to follow those but didnt investiagte anyfurther but went for long walk instead. I am going to talk her again today about but wanted to hear your guyses opinion/input as well first.

My approach would have been as follows: i go talk her today mentioning the conversation from yesterday and explaining my point of view first that because of my history of beint cheated on i might be a little bit senstive with those kind of topics. I would explain how i wished she would have told me instantly when it happened and i want to know her thought process of only blocking him later even after he confessee ""his love"". 

My question to you guys and girls is, when youre reading this do you see an insecure guy who just needs to get more confident with himself and get over it since nothing really happened and i do admit i sometimes have a hard time getting over those things or would you also confront her about it and if yes in the same way or would you add something ? I dont want to bring up old situations up in the conversation susch as early snapcbat ""incident"" since i think it would be unfair including something we both agreeed on we talked about and put behind us.

I dont want to forbid her having guy friend and i dont want to forbide her using snapchat or whatver she chooses to use but i does always leave a wierd feeling when i see her use the app if that makes sense.... i want to just have a normal releationship without those weird thoughts in the back of my head but im also aware that this requires work from my side as well.

I know it always difficult giving an opinion from such a small text but i hope ill get some good inputs how to approach the situation or if im overreacting how i can managed to handle my feelings better.",3,1745288908.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

I love my morning coffee outside, soaking in nature in pretty places, niche Pinterest boards, themed playlists, and absurd memes. Bonus points if you love yelling about and analyzing art and media. Music, movies, and video games are my major hobbies. Usually obscure bands, horror, and Warframe/Pokemon respectively. You can usually find me hanging around r/LetGirlsHaveFun and r/SillyGirlClub. Often called multifaceted and you'll never find me stuck in one box. Variety is the spice of life kinda gal.

**The deep stuff:**

Working hard to try to improve my mental health and feel more present. I’ve got a lot of feelings, but also always trying to be silly and light-hearted. I feel things very deeply and always have something bubbling under the surface. If you're someone who gets that, we might vibe. I'm loyal like it’s my job, but also really avoidant and will probably ghost you at LEAST once, especially when I have 34 people to dm (working hard to do better at this too). I don’t really know how to be anything but sincere, even when I’m anxious or avoidant or scared.

I know Ill see him in a few months but it hurts. Its a couple days of bliss before we go back to our lives. We appreciate as much time as we can during the short trips

But I dont get to play with his messy hair while we share a cup of coffee

I miss him so intensely it's hard to focus or sleep for a few days after. We talk on the phone and text all the time but it's incomparable to when he's next to me

Ive never felt so in love until I met him. Its hard to keep having so much distance between us. I want to be able to go through life alongside him, not a phone call away  ",3,1745288122.0,LongDistance,2,1.0,False
