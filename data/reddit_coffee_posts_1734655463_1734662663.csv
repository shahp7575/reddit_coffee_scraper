1hi9vdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1hi9vdj/in_such_a_bad_way_right_now/,In such a bad way right now...,"Spouse started nonsense about 8 weeks ago over the fact I'd skipped a shower that day and didn't have makeup on, even though I had explained that our kiddo (5 years old, that has some behavioral issues and speech delay) made it difficult and my mother worked late and wasn't able to help watch him. (He had just called me ""babe"" in a text message on the way home, then later split on me.) 

The next week was more nonsense because sometimes I forget to wash the coffee pot (that only he uses) and that I don't iron his work clothes every night (because I don't want our youngest trying to mess with the iron during his moments when he's getting into everything). He went on to text me that washing the coffee pot every day and ironing his work clothes every day would make him feel loved and supported, while also telling me he's not in love with me in the same text. 

So, it's been another cycle of weeks without affection, largely being ignored. And today through checking things out are signs of him being on Tinder and new selfies taken. 

I can't leave for financial reasons, my kiddo is currently waitlisted for preschool, we can't afford daycare. I'm an only child and we are also roommates with my mother, so I can't just go and move in with her. Nobody can afford to leave. And I know it'd be awesome for me to just be away from him but it's not possible at the moment.

This is coming from a place of care. It is very concerning that she wakes up late in the day then within an hour or two after waking she needs to nap again on live or starts falling asleep on live. It’s the same pattern every day of the same thing; doing makeup then falling asleep in the afternoon till c gets home . I don’t  want to tell her what to do but I see a lot of people encouraging her to take care of herself better, or telling her to eat have a coffee etc. she would feel so much better if she actually cooked some good healthy food instead of takeout, got a good sleeping pattern, went for a walk during the day, tidied up her space and did some nice things for herself. Even just a home cooked healthy meal makes a world of difference. It’s no life to live sleeping away your 20’s, she’s far too young to need to nap so often. Again this is not me hating at all it’s just hard to see. She says she’s fine and happy but you can’t be. Napping that often and not eating properly during the day is definitely a sign of depression I’ve been through it and the only way you can make yourself feel better is if you do it for yourself :( she deserves to be happy (sorry about the paragraph) ",2,1734662053.0,britniejlockyersnark,3,1.0,False
1hi9tcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1hi9tcv/what_i_wish_i_could_take_long/,What I wish I could take (long),"Hi Beatrice, I decided since today’s the day we’re doing the intake appointment, I wanted to be more clear about where I’m at with us right now.    

I understand I have extreme, intense, anxiety driven emotional attachments at times. These are exhausting, hard to put up with, and need repair and reconciliation. I want to and have worked on those and continue to do so. But progress is not linear And i will falter and continue to do so. I’m extremely sorry for the pain, embarrassment, and emotional labor you’ve had to do as a result of them, and I hate knowing that I can be that way.   

It’s also hard though when you don’t recognize the way you have treated me early and often has led to a sharp increase in those feelings of instability I act on. Which I know isn’t the best phrasing, but I guess I mean that a lot of traumas were inflicted on our foundation by you early on: the ultimatum has had a huge impact on my security with respect to you hanging out with Alyse or Jake. The months that followed, where you kept me I. The dark on your level of communications with her, would randomly meet her for “coffee” and I had to trust you had not been physical with your ex of five years, when you went to a bar and kissed her multiple times and asked her to hate fuck you as I sat at home trying to be supportive thinking you were just talking things out, or when you went to dinner with a month before we moved to our current house. That, coupled with the odd feelings I’ve had regarding December 9th, which is why those messages on your Alexa perturbed me so much, have inflicted intense trust issues for me. That I’ve tried, extremely hard, to work through and past.   

And it has felt like you don’t want me to succeed at times. As soon as I was stating to feel secure, you would do something else:
- the new years demand for an open relationship 
- Getting drunk or intoxicated and comparing me to Alyse or noting what she would be okay with that I’m not
- Telling me, in front of my friends, that you were worried if you went to a club you would get to drunk and cheat on me
- Belittling or dismissing my very real and valid discomfort at times around certain situations. not attempts to control you but just expressing a need for reassurance, and displaying a complete apathy in doing so 
- The bikestop incident. Where you would proceed to make out with someone else, ask to suck his dick, and then gaslight me about it. Later that night, you would take a dick lubed with coconut oil and shove inside of me after I repeatedly told you I was not comfortable having sex that night. When I told you to stop, you then berated me and said that if I wasn’t going to put out, I should At least let you have a lover.
- You went to a club in Berlin and partied for 18 hours which isn’t bad but was hard, but would not FaceTime me while you were in Berlin despite saying you would, and even that night said you would FaceTime me but then went mia.  
    - Yes, the way I responded was also bad. Exhausting. Bpd, cptsd, one of the d’s. But I have felt so insecure in the relationship because of repeated betrayals of it and its security.   
- You regularly maintain communications and hang outs with someone you tried to force a relationship with for four years in Jake, and you insist he was not or is not an ex. Jake is also someone that urged you to break up with me for Alyse. And you did it.    
- You regularly, consistently, and often times it has felt like maliciously flirt with people I’ve expressed insecurity over in front of me. You say things like “if I was single I would fuck him again” or if I express insecurity you will go and do it to excess to the point of neglecting me at a birthday party I planned, organized, and threw for you.  When all I wanted was to express an insecurity.    
- While I was away in Vegas, your phone was off and when it turned on you were at Jake and Alyse’s house. Something I’ve expressed multiple times a discomfort over, and you did it while I was out of town and I am to take your word that Alyse was not there while her friend was in town.   
- You express  desire to go out clubbing with Jake until late in the morning.  
Those are a few of the relationships strifes that have contributed to my increasing sense of instability and insecurity, and I don’t know if you’re fully aware or not. I hope you’re not. These things don’t just go away, they need to be worked through and resolved. A lot of times I feel like they’re resolved by me just dropping the issue, and your resentment at me grows. And I feel like I can’t have needs, or wants, or feelings. The wedding is another really good example. You were invited to be a bridesmaid in a wedding, and I was not allowed to attend because I’m transgender. You attended, anyways,  and when I expressed a small ask to not see the slippers from the trip you said “it’s not a big deal,” just dismissing my feelings. And did, often about the wedding. Most of your friends even agreed that you should not go from what I heard.     

So while your feelings of being controlled and isolated are definitely valid, so are mine that I feel like I only ever express emotions to you, and I have tried so very hard not to isolate you at my own expense. You regularly do things like the wedding, Jake, Alyse, and others that I express discomfort with but never demand you don’t do, just tell you how much it will hurt me. If that is controlling, I don’t know how else I or anyone can be in a relationship and express our thoughts on things.    

As far as isolating, You go on trips with your friends, do things with them, and do all these things and I don’t demand you don’t do. I want to be invited, and Im hurt sometimes when I’m not and express that- sometimes not the best way but other times it’s been pretty standard.    

That said, I do jealousy and trust issues that I need to work on badly. When I hyperfixate on the worst possible outcome, I can become so focused that I will come up with reason after reason it’s so for you to dismiss. That’s unhealthy and I know that. And I’m sorry for the stress and pain and hardship that caused you.    

 I think your fear of intimacy leads you to behave and provoke increasing reactions from me and your past partners and you struggle to be accountable for their long term impacts on the safety and foundation of a relationship. I don’t think this,
Right now, is all about the things it’s about. I think a big part of it is an uncomfortability in feeling inadequate, in feeling like they let their partner down, and also a fear of the defense with your family and me in the same city.    

The fear of intimacy has also harmed our security and will in every relationship, because it’s something that changes how you interact with your partner whenever you feel commitment approaching. Moving in, dating, future plans- they are all things you want but also scare you. The further away they are the easier they are to fantasize about, which is why the future faking you did early in our relationship makes sense but it’s also been damaging to my security for it to
Pulled out from underneath me  the very second that you started missing Alyse last December. Which is what I took a mal adaptive thought pattern to the other night. Still my fault and I’m sorry.    

On being isolated, I am the most isolated of the two of us right now. I feel, and you’ve expressed can’t bring you around my friends, and part of that is my fault but also because of a lack of accountability for the way your actions, statements, and behaviors have been perceived without me even saying anything and a discomfort with feeling judged. This was true right after bikestop, when you immediately berated me for telling Rachel and ficca. I have lost two communities that were dear to me, snd I know you recognize that part of Seattle was the stress that we were both under dealing with the Alyse drama.   

The flip side is I have regularly had to interact with friends of yours I know have judgements about me, whether it be Brandon, Nick, Jake, Winslow, or Ari. I do it, and I try to be accountable for what you’ve said they’ve expressed.  You have expressed an extreme discomfort in doing that, even before going through my phone to read my texts with my friends regarding the wedding, us, and bikestop.    

But I do recognize that substance abuse and use has contributed to those feelings, and I’m sorry and will change. I recognize that you are slow to trust that, but I’m also slow to trust you on it. The best thing would probably be to just trust each other, and if we see it’s not coming to fruition this time, it’s an immediate end to the relationship.    

But off of that- I recognize that I have other toxic partners of behavior too. I do look over your shoulder on your phone. Early on in our relationship, you would  lay in front of me and show me almost every text you were sending intentionally. Randomly, one day, you started hiding it. I know now that’s when you started texting Alyse a little bit more, and my security dropped. I still shouldn’t do it to the level that I do it, and it reflects a deep insecurity I have that you deserve much better than someone
Like me. I have been and will
Work on it and know that one’s a lot better.   

Another one I have is wanting constant access to
You, which is both unrealistic and damaging to our relationship. I have and will continue to work on that.   

The Alexa thing, I am sorry about. I am
Sorry about the insistence. I was and am confused why you removed me from your house hold on Amazon, why you decided to not let me have access anymore even prior to that, and when I saw Alyse’s number I panicked. When I saw the date I panicked even more. Especially after you spoke about her nonstop at your birthday. But I’m still sorry. I’m sorry for degree of the insistence, for the accusation, for the inability to let it go.   

And I recognize the way that substance abuse has impacted us and our troubles this year. And you said it’s been hard the last three months. It has been. There have been three major hard things. Vegas, texts, and the wedding. There’s been hard things at every step of the way, in every relationship. And I am willing, ready, and able to fix the hard things with you. But I need you to recognize that fault isn’t on me and this being “my last straw” feels incredibly unfair right now.    

And I need you to recognize that your behaviors have at times edged onto or been full blown emotional abuse down to sexual abuse.    


In particular, the triangulation you have put me through our entire relationship has been a daunting task to not feel overly jealous. Whether that be the bar with Alyse, the dinner, the secret meet ups, and the reluctance to disclose that you’ve been communicating with her as recently as October 2024.   

Or Donzell, when you invited him to Pride- he’s straight right? And then your birthday when I expressed a discomfort and just wanted you to know, and then you decided to go fully “okay if you’re jealous watch this.” The constant push on my boundaries and comfort level and no attempt to empathize with me whatsoever for a moment in these situations or afterwards was incredibly difficult. Even Jake at times feels like a continuation of that triangulation behavior.   

You have regularly gotten so drunk that you have belittled me, compared me to Alyse as a lesser partner, and been cruel with your words. You also are just cruel with your words. You give everyone else around you this different person and version of yourself than is behind closed doors, where you call resort to belittling my intelligence, abilities, and attractiveness.   

You also are doing this at such an odd time, right after being accused, that it’s only increasing my perception that an affair has been ongoing with someone. You’ve been going to see “Jake” more, wearing lipstick to yoga and being more and more secretive about your plans. It’s fine, I knew you were a cheater with me and I knew you would do it on me. I have things to work on this relationship has taught me, I wonder if you’ll ever recognize your own flaws.",1,1734661994.0,letters,1,1.0,False

1hi9ny6,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_Connect/comments/1hi9ny6/vpns_for_business_use_secure_remote_work_and/,VPNs for Business Use: Secure Remote Work and Protecting Company Data,"As businesses increasingly embrace remote work and cloud-based solutions, ensuring the security and privacy of company data has never been more important. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is one of the most effective tools businesses can use to safeguard sensitive information and provide secure remote access to employees. Whether your team is working from home, on the go, or in a different office location, a VPN can help protect your company’s data from cyber threats, maintain privacy, and facilitate secure communication. In this post, we’ll explore how VPNs can enhance business security, enable secure remote work, and protect company data.

1. What is a VPN for Business Use?

A VPN for business use is a secure connection that allows employees to access a company’s internal network, applications, and data safely over the internet. A VPN works by encrypting the internet traffic between the user's device and the company's network, making it difficult for hackers or unauthorized users to access sensitive information. By using a VPN, businesses can ensure that their data remains confidential, even when employees are working remotely or using unsecured networks, such as public Wi-Fi.

2. Benefits of Using a VPN for Business

1. Secure Remote Access to Company Resources

Remote Work: With remote work becoming increasingly popular, a VPN enables employees to securely access the company’s internal network, file servers, and applications, no matter where they are located. It creates an encrypted tunnel between the employee’s device and the corporate network, ensuring that sensitive business data is protected from unauthorized access.

Cross-Border Connectivity: For businesses with teams in different countries, a VPN allows seamless and secure access to company resources, no matter where employees are working from. This is especially useful for companies operating in multiple locations or managing distributed teams.

2. Protect Company Data and Prevent Cyber Threats

Encryption: VPNs encrypt all internet traffic, ensuring that any data transmitted between remote employees and the company network remains private and protected. This is crucial for preventing data breaches and cyberattacks, such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where hackers try to intercept sensitive information.

Secure Communication: VPNs ensure that emails, documents, and other communications within the company remain secure, reducing the risk of interception by cybercriminals.

3. Safeguard Against Public Wi-Fi Vulnerabilities

Protection on Unsecure Networks: When employees use public Wi-Fi networks (such as those found in airports, hotels, or coffee shops), they are vulnerable to cybercriminals who can intercept unencrypted data. VPNs provide an extra layer of protection by encrypting internet traffic, making it difficult for hackers to steal login credentials, financial information, or sensitive company data.

Safe File Sharing and Collaboration: Using a VPN allows employees to share files and collaborate on projects securely without worrying about their data being intercepted on public networks.

4. Privacy and Anonymity for Employees

Masking IP Addresses: A VPN masks the employee’s real IP address and replaces it with the IP address of the VPN server, protecting their identity and location. This is important for maintaining privacy and preventing the tracking of employee activities.

No Logging of User Activities: Many businesses choose a VPN provider with a no-logs policy, which ensures that the VPN service does not track or store any information about the company’s internal communications or employee internet activity. This adds another layer of privacy and security for both the company and its employees.

5. Bypass Geo-Restrictions and Access Internal Resources

Access Blocked Content: Some businesses may need to access region-restricted resources, services, or websites. A VPN allows employees to bypass these geo-restrictions and access content as though they are in a different region, enabling smooth collaboration across borders.

Global Connectivity: A VPN enables employees working in different regions to have the same level of access to internal company resources, ensuring business continuity and productivity.

6. Centralized Control and Monitoring

Manage Employee Access: A business VPN allows IT administrators to set specific access rights for employees, ensuring that sensitive company data and systems are only accessible to authorized personnel. You can control who connects to the company’s network, which devices can connect, and the permissions granted to users.

Monitor Activity and Prevent Misuse: With the right VPN solution, businesses can monitor network traffic to identify any unusual activity that could indicate a security threat or misuse of company resources. Some VPN providers also offer detailed logging and reporting features for better control over remote access.

3. How VPNs Enable Secure Remote Work

With the rise of remote work, businesses must adopt new strategies to maintain productivity and security outside the office. VPNs are essential in facilitating secure remote work, providing the following key benefits:

1. Seamless Remote Access to Internal Resources

Employees can use their laptops, smartphones, or tablets to access company data and applications securely, even when working from home or while traveling. A VPN ensures that all connections to the company network are encrypted, preventing unauthorized access to confidential business information.

2. Reduced Risk of Cybersecurity Threats

Remote workers are often targeted by cybercriminals who exploit weaknesses in their home networks or unsecured Wi-Fi. With a VPN, remote workers are protected by the same level of security they would have if they were in the office, minimizing the risk of malware, phishing attacks, or data theft.

3. Enhanced Collaboration for Distributed Teams

In addition to securing communication, VPNs enable teams in different geographical locations to collaborate effectively. Team members can share files, access internal documents, and participate in video calls securely, without the risk of third-party interception.

4. Selecting the Best VPN for Your Business

When choosing a VPN for your business, it’s important to select a provider that meets your specific needs in terms of security, performance, and scalability. Here are some factors to consider:

1. Security Features

Look for a VPN that offers AES-256-bit encryption, DNS leak protection, and Kill Switch features to secure employee traffic.

A no-logs policy is also crucial to ensure that employee data and business communications are not tracked.

2. Scalability

Choose a VPN provider that can scale with your business as it grows, supporting multiple users and devices without sacrificing performance.

3. Performance and Speed

Opt for a VPN with fast speeds and low latency to ensure that remote work doesn’t experience slowdowns or interruptions.

4. Device Compatibility

Ensure that the VPN is compatible with the devices your employees use, including Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and even mobile devices or routers.

5. Centralized Control and Monitoring

Choose a VPN provider that allows you to manage and monitor employee connections, restrict access to sensitive information, and track usage for security and compliance purposes.

Popular VPN providers for business use include NordVPN Teams, ExpressVPN for Business, CyberGhost for Teams, and Perimeter 81, which offer comprehensive features designed for secure remote work and protecting company data.

5. Conclusion

As businesses continue to embrace remote work and digital collaboration, ensuring the security and privacy of company data has become more critical than ever. A VPN is a vital tool for businesses to protect sensitive information, enable secure access to internal resources, and maintain privacy for remote employees. By using a VPN, businesses can offer secure remote access, protect against cyber threats, and enable seamless collaboration across distributed teams.

If your business has remote employees or operates in multiple locations, investing in a VPN solution can greatly enhance your security, safeguard company data, and support a productive, secure work environment.

At the time, the best thing for me was to move in with family and help both myself financially and them financially a little. 

I've decided I wanted to be on my own again and am in a good position now to do so. However, I am feeling so much guilt over this. I feel so bad. I know a lot of this I learned in childhood. I always had to please others, do as they say. Always felt so bad for putting myself first. I grew up and got married, and sadly, my marriage was a lot of the same. To include the abuse. But I was always called selfish for doing things while married, and that was literally anything. Putting music on my amazon Playlist, getting coffee (even though I'd ask if she wanted some), everything I did, I was deemed selfish. 


So I know, logically,  I'm not selfish for wanting to move out and be alone again. I suppose I feel bad because I would hope this family member would not be left struggling. 

I guess I wanted to get how I'm feeling out in the world, I will think about this forever and ever if I don't.

1hi9dqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/movieideas/comments/1hi9dqf/100_to_1/,100 to 1,"Movie idea: 100 to 1

In the fast-paced romantic comedy 100 to 1, sibling rivalry takes a hilariously over-the-top turn as two fiercely competitive sisters, Amelia and Tesserae, set out on a wild quest for love. Both career-driven and perpetually single, the sisters find themselves at odds during a family reunion when their meddling grandmother hints that neither of them is “bridal material.” The comment sparks a heated debate about who is more likely to walk down the aisle first, leading Amelia and Tesserae to concoct a high-stakes challenge: each must date 100 men, and the first to find “the one” and get engaged wins. The rules are simple but strict: the men must be strangers, each date must last at least two hours, repeat dates don’t count, and you have to end up with one of the 100. Armed with dating apps, friends’ setups, and a bit of sheer desperation, the sisters dive into a whirlwind of dinners, awkward coffee meetups, and chaotic adventures. Their parents watch the madness unfold with a mix of amusement and horror, while their close-knit friend group provides plenty of sarcastic commentary and moral support.
Amelia, the older sister, is pragmatic and organized, treating the challenge like a business plan. She keeps spreadsheets tracking compatibility, and interests. Tesserae, the free-spirited younger sister, embraces chaos, quite a party animal, viewing the challenge as an opportunity to enjoy life’s unpredictability. As the competition intensifies, the sisters begin to lose sight of why they started the challenge. Their sibling bond strains under the pressure, and both face hilarious missteps in their love lives. However, things take an unexpected turn when Amelia meets Everett, a thoughtful English architect with a dry sense of humor and a strong love for facts, while Tesserae runs into with Dakota, a musician at a local restaurant, who shares her interest of having fun in life. Suddenly, it’s no longer just about winning. Both sisters must confront their insecurities and reevaluate what they truly want in a partner and from each other. When the sisters finally resolve their dispute and decide to let go of their “silly” challenge a twist of fate bring their dying grandmother to continue the conversation by telling them that whoever got married first would inherit everything that she’d owned which happened to be very wealthy. Amelia and Tesserae are initially shocked by their grandmother’s revelation, but the sisters quickly revert to their competitive ways. Determined not to lose the inheritance, they start pressuring Everett and Dakota to take the next step, leading to a series of increasingly awkward and hilarious moments. Everett, a meticulous planner, grows flustered by Amelia’s sudden urgency, while Dakota, usually laid-back, starts feeling the weight of Tesserae’s new obsession with commitment. As tensions rise, both sisters face setbacks. Amelia, in her efforts to “seal the deal,” tries to plan the perfect proposal moment for Everett but ends up scaring him off with her intensity. Meanwhile, Tesserae’s carefree approach backfires when Dakota accuses her of not being serious about him but only about winning the challenge. For the first time, both women are forced to confront the flaws in their approach to love. In a their sorrow, Amelia and Tesserae sit together in their family home and finally have an honest conversation. Amelia admits that she’s afraid of being alone, while Tesserae confesses that her wild approach to life is often a way to mask her own insecurities. They both agree that their obsession with beating each other has led them to lose sight of what really matters: finding genuine love and strengthening their bond as sisters. Inspired by their newfound clarity, Amelia and Tesserae take action to repair their relationships. Amelia visits Everett and apologizes for her behavior, promising to let their relationship progress naturally. Touched by her vulnerability, Everett admits that he’s fallen for her, spreadsheets and all. Tesserae finds Dakota at a gig and gives an uncharacteristically heartfelt speech, telling him that she wants to be with him, not because of a challenge, but because he makes her truly happy. Dakota forgives her, saying he’s been waiting for her to take something seriously and he’s glad it’s him. The sisters then confront their grandmother, calling out her manipulative tactics and refusing to let money dictate their love lives. Their defiance earns a wry smile from her; she admits it was a test all along to see if they’d finally stop competing and grow closer.

I'm diligently seeking with all of my heart to find out the truth of why we are here.

This is my biggest issue that I'm faced with:

So, the idea of Christianity (or *Some other Religions),* states that we people are broken, and we are born broken (*Sinners),* and that as sinners we must come to this realization that we are sinners, and after we come to that fact we have to come to the point of realization that we need to be saved from these actions (*our sins and all sins as a whole, for it is in the bible that we are all guilty of all sin).*

So with this religion, it was sent to sinners a child, born in bethleham, by miraculous conception, by an all-knowing, omnipotent, everlasting God-Head (*So to speak, the supreme being of the everything).* This man is named Jesus (*Yeshua, Messiah, Emmanuel*). However, this man is not just a son of man, but he's the son of god, and also the God-Head that I spoke about earlier.

Now this man was prophesied to be put to death by *sinners* for *sinners.*

Now if one is to not believe in this man from birth, they are considered damned already, because they did not believe in him.

However, this Man (*whom also is the God-Head I spoke about earlier),* is the one who gives that faith.

I've genuinely prayed for this faith and no it has not been found by me, unless for some reason I have this faith but I can't comprehend that I have this faith.

It says he who seeks, shall find. I know that's written in the word. Now I come to my next point;

In-God's time.

I can respect that, that's cool and all, but why is it that people claim to have these experiences, near death experiences, where they will die and come back from the dead and preach that;

1. They saw heaven, met Jesus (*or some other spiritual being),* and we returned to this earth to spread that they met him.
2. They saw hellfire, millions (even billions) of people in these places burning alive, to be reassembled and burned again (*or various other forms of torture according to the sins they did not repent of).*

Now, first off, do not think I've come here to test you faith, (*but hey, maybe i am by some dark spiritual force unknowingly to myself).*

Why is it that there are some that are ""Chosen"" and some are ""Not Chosen""? Why is it that some are born with the power inside themselves to have ""Faith"" and others ""Not"".

Now if you're about to tell me, ""It's by the will of the Father"", then that's fair, he's the supreme being and his will be done.

However, why is it that someone is made here, knowing that the actions they will choose will lead them to hell?

To me, it seems like RNG rather someone will end up in hell or in heaven.

I personally would like to live forever, yes, I think that life is a gift yes, but why is it that we humans really don't have a say in where our ultimate destiny will be.

I can not choose to serve a god who (*even though he could easily prevent it)* to allow billions and billions of people to go to *EVERLASTING DAMNATION.*

I'm not claiming Christianity is wrong, but I'm done saying it's right. I will continue to seek, and I will keep knocking, but just not as much. I'm going to make it my lifes mission to find out why we people are on this earth.

I do believe yes, murderers and rapists, liars and thieves, adulterers, should be punished, but I do not believe that *Everlasting Damnation* fits these crimes. If you believe that, then by all means keep believing that, but I don't know how you could ever love this ""God Head"" more then you love your mother or father, your brother sister, or your neighbor.

and before you comment:  
No I don't care about anything in this life except for people, I could care less if I had money, cars. I of course want to have a family and stuff (which I did at one point) but I ruined it.

And yes, I realize a lot of my problems are my fault for doing some of the things I did, but too have everyone turn their backs on me (except say for 1) is kind of bullcrap.

TL:DR  
No I do not 100% believe in Jesus nor do I disbelieve in him, why did god create people who he knew would go to hell (*even the fallen angels for that matter)?*

Note:  
If Jesus were to come to me tonight, and say I am the son of God you must follow me, my bags would be packed faster than a dog eating a sub you left on the coffee table to go grab a water.

2. I have already applied to the library and then contacted multiple people about on campus jobs (library, gym, post office, cafeteria, coffee shops) and didn't get a single response from anyone. 

3. I don't really know how to apply to be a TA, I can't find the resources online. I have heard that the school prioritizes international students for this position, and since I'm not international, help on that would be fantastic.

4. My parents won't let me nanny. My parents also don't want me working in person far away from campus. They also don't want me working a food job. (They are helping pay for my rent so I can't really go against their wishes)

5. I know tutoring is an option, but I will definitely need another job since the few hours and low pay is not enough.

1hi9307,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1hi9307/does_this_not_seem_like_a_problem/,Does this not seem like a problem?,"So, here we go . . .

I'm diligently seeking with all of my heart to find out the truth of why we are here.

This is my biggest issue that I'm faced with:

So, the idea of Christianity (or *Some other Religions),* states that we people are broken, and we are born broken (*Sinners),* and that as sinners we must come to this realization that we are sinners, and after we come to that fact we have to come to the point of realization that we need to be saved from these actions (*our sins and all sins as a whole, for it is in the bible that we are all guilty of all sin).*

So with this religion, it was sent to sinners a child, born in bethleham, by miraculous conception, by an all-knowing, omnipotent, everlasting God-Head (*So to speak, the supreme being of the everything).* This man is named Jesus (*Yeshua, Messiah, Emmanuel*). However, this man is not just a son of man, but he's the son of god, and also the God-Head that I spoke about earlier.

Now this man was prophesied to be put to death by *sinners* for *sinners.*

Now if one is to not believe in this man from birth, they are considered damned already, because they did not believe in him.

However, this Man (*whom also is the God-Head I spoke about earlier),* is the one who gives that faith.

I've genuinely prayed for this faith and no it has not been found by me, unless for some reason I have this faith but I can't comprehend that I have this faith.

It says he who seeks, shall find. I know that's written in the word. Now I come to my next point;

In-God's time.

I can respect that, that's cool and all, but why is it that people claim to have these experiences, near death experiences, where they will die and come back from the dead and preach that;

1. They saw heaven, met Jesus (*or some other spiritual being),* and we returned to this earth to spread that they met him.
2. They saw hellfire, millions (even billions) of people in these places burning alive, to be reassembled and burned again (*or various other forms of torture according to the sins they did not repent of).*

Now, first off, do not think I've come here to test you faith, (*but hey, maybe i am by some dark spiritual force unknowingly to myself).*

Why is it that there are some that are ""Chosen"" and some are ""Not Chosen""? Why is it that some are born with the power inside themselves to have ""Faith"" and others ""Not"".

Now if you're about to tell me, ""It's by the will of the Father"", then that's fair, he's the supreme being and his will be done.

However, why is it that someone is made here, knowing that the actions they will choose will lead them to hell?

To me, it seems like RNG rather someone will end up in hell or in heaven.

I personally would like to live forever, yes, I think that life is a gift yes, but why is it that we humans really don't have a say in where our ultimate destiny will be.

I can not choose to serve a god who (*even though he could easily prevent it)* to allow billions and billions of people to go to *EVERLASTING DAMNATION.*

I'm not claiming Christianity is wrong, but I'm done saying it's right. I will continue to seek, and I will keep knocking, but just not as much. I'm going to make it my lifes mission to find out why we people are on this earth.

I do believe yes, murderers and rapists, liars and thieves, adulterers, should be punished, but I do not believe that *Everlasting Damnation* fits these crimes. If you believe that, then by all means keep believing that, but I don't know how you could ever love this ""God Head"" more then you love your mother or father, your brother sister, or your neighbor.

and before you comment:  
No I don't give a shit about anything in this life except for people, I could care less if I had money, cars. I of course want to have a family and stuff (which I did at one point) but I ruined it.

And yes, I realize a lot of my problems are my fault for doing some of the things I did, but too have everyone turn their backs on me (except say for 1) is kind of bullcrap.

TL:DR  
No I do not 100% believe in Jesus nor do I disbelieve in him, why did god create people who he knew would go to hell (*even the fallen angels for that matter)?*

Note:  
If Jesus were to come to me tonight, and say I am the son of God you must follow me, my bags would be packed faster than a dog eating a sub you left on the coffee table to go grab a water.

 I love media in every shape. Movies, shows, YouTube, memes, anime, you name it. I love a well made story. I watch movies the way people read books, activily invested in the story and dissecting the hell out of it. I would read too but idk where to start😅

I love music in almost every shape and form! I play a handful of instruments and right now my goal is to get a few covers out on YouTube! I’m always looking for new music so pleaseeeeee send me your favorite tunes! 9 times out of 10 it’ll become my new favorite music and we can obsess over artists together!

Good food is seasoned food and I’m all about good food! Some heavy hitters are kbbq, ramen, seafood, tacos of all shapes & sizes, vegan dishes, the list goes on honestly!
I love making food and drinks for people. My dream is to have ramen bar of sorts and give people a multi course meal with various mixed drinks included. I used to be a barista so coffee drinks are included for the brunch version of this!

This is very true I’m definitely always listening but I’m also always living in the moment! I just love observing. I love noticing things and learning how the world works. Some people say “it’s not that deep man” and I hate that phrase. That’s one way to stop someone from living/experiencing life.

We’re thrilled to announce that our friends at The Ministry of Coffee recently debuted Ground Work, a new blend that just hit the shelves, and they’re donated $5 from every bag sold to CMHA Ottawa!

“Having opened a new cafe on Laurier Avenue—and with the issues we are facing downtown—I wanted to find a way to contribute to CMHA Ottawa’s efforts supporting mental health and homelessness in the surrounding area,” says Josef Mott, Head of Coffee. 

According to Josef, the way modern coffee has focused so much on improving every part of the supply chain involved in producing specialty coffee, this was the direction he and the team at The Ministry of Coffee felt most passionate about pursuing. Given the efforts of CMHA Ottawa’s talented and dedicated frontline staff—the boots on the ground—the name “Ground Work” couldn’t be more appropriate.

The beans in Ground Work are ever changing, with a view to recoup the costs of raw material and labour put into producing coffee beans while also giving something back to the local community.

Ground Work is now available in-store and online. It retails for $20 (330 g, pre-ground).

Visit Ministry’s new location on Laurier Avenue (just behind Lord Elgin hotel) or any other location and pick up a bag today!

Looking for a last-minute gift idea? Ground Work makes for a great holiday gift for the socially-minded coffee lover in your family or friend group.

From all of us at CMHA Ottawa: Thank you, Josef and the whole team at The Ministry of Coffee for your generosity and care for the community we both serve.

Nous sommes ravis d’annoncer que nos amis de The Ministry of Coffee ont récemment lancé Ground Work, un nouveau mélange qui vient d’arriver sur les tablettes, et qu’ils ont fait don de 5 $ pour chaque sac vendu à l’ACSM d’Ottawa !

« Ayant ouvert un nouveau café sur l’avenue Laurier et compte tenu des problèmes auxquels nous sommes confrontés au centre-ville, je voulais trouver un moyen de contribuer aux efforts de l’ACSM Ottawa en matière de santé mentale et de lutte contre l’itinérance dans les environs », a déclaré Josef Mott, directeur du café.

Selon Josef, la façon dont le café moderne s’est concentré sur l’amélioration de chaque partie de la chaîne d’approvisionnement impliquée dans la production de café de spécialité, c’était la direction que lui et l’équipe du Ministry of Coffee se sentaient les plus passionnés de poursuivre. Étant donné les efforts du personnel de première ligne talentueux et dévoué de l’ACSM Ottawa – les bottes sur le terrain – le nom « Ground Work » ne pourrait pas être plus approprié.

Les grains du café Ground Work changent constamment, dans le but de récupérer les coûts des matières premières et de la main-d’œuvre nécessaires à la production des grains de café, tout en redonnant quelque chose à la communauté locale.

Ground Work est désormais disponible en magasin et en ligne. Il se vend 20 $ (330 g, prémoulu).

Visitez le nouvel emplacement de Ministry sur l’avenue Laurier (juste derrière l’hôtel Lord Elgin) ou tout autre emplacement et procurez-vous un sac dès aujourd’hui !

Vous cherchez une idée de cadeau de dernière minute ? Ground Work est un excellent cadeau pour l’amateur de café socialement engagé de votre famille ou de votre groupe d’amis.

De la part de tous les membres de l’ACSM Ottawa : Merci à Josef et à toute l’équipe du Ministry of Coffee pour leur générosité et leur souci de la communauté que nous servons tous les deux.

Her kit is mainly based around harassing enemies to build a special resource called Guilt, before disappearing behind allied lines (screwing over her allies in the process if need be) and dealing massive damage when out of sight.

Thematically, the two core elements that are important to me are: Executing/Screwing your allies while generating Guilt (Adelaide feels bad about carrying out her duties), and consuming Guilt for powerful basic attacks that are aimed at finishing enemies off with Finish the Job (Adelaide steels herself to accomplish her duties), representing the character's inner dilemma. The kit is experimental, and I'm rather, but hope you enjoy. More notes at the end of the post.

 

# Adelaide, the Suppression Operative

Captain-Commissar Adelaide Verdain is the head of the Noxian Military’s Internal Affairs bureau. Once a mellow but shrewd officer, Adelaide led many suicide charges and desperate maneuvers that, somehow, miraculously succeeded, before losing an eye and using the opportunity to retire early. 

The job is cushy, but unenviable, where an office desk safely tucked away inside the Immortal Bastion, far from the trenches, is paid for in long hours of logistical planning, and spreadsheets upon spreadsheets. Her department is the one called whenever an operation or mission has stalled, and needs some supervision or serious correction, requiring occasional deployments in the furthest reaches of the empire.

But under the appearances of pen pushing, the division serves a much more crucial role: Adelaide, as the Grand General’s oldest and only confidant, acts as the head of his secret military police. 

Given freedom and autonomy that exceed even the Trifarix’s knowledge, her duty is to seek out and neutralize internal threats to the empire, take control of missions that are not allowed to fail, no matter the casualties, and extrajudicially execute rogue quantities, whose greed or ambition have exceeded their loyalty to Noxus. Even if it sometimes means killing old friends, drinking buddies, or men and women she slept in a trench with.

She helped Jericho Swain trick and tame the demon of secrets, prevented Boram Darkwill’s escape, and erased her name from all historical records of the coup, to stay as the Grand General’s shadow, only a childhood friend that was left in the dust of his ascension. To better protect him, and foster his dream. 

In exchange for her loyalty, she was given one of Raum’s eyes, to replace the one she lost in Ionia, and swore an oath to bring about Swain’s death should he ever betray his own ideals. But every death she brings, every familiar face turned into a red smear, whittles her down, one by one. Executing the man closest to her heart, should it ever come to pass, will be her final mission, she is sure.

 

**Classes**: Marksman, Artillery. 

**Roles**: Bottom. 

**Intended Strength**: Range, hit and run, tactical advantage (vision, silence, pillboxes to deny vision and chokeholds). At high Guilt, massive criticals and damage.

**Intended Weakness**: Squishy, easy to catch on CD, easy to misplay, screwed if trapped in terrain, little to no mobility. 

**BASIC STATS**: 

Health: 560 - 2050. 

Health Regen: 3.75 - 13. 

Armor: 25 - 105. Attack Damage: 60 - 110. 

MR: 30 - 55. Crit. Damage: 150%.

MS: 330. Attack Range: 600.

Base AS: 0.625. Bonus AS: 0 - 45%. Attack Windup: 14.5%.

Missile Speed: 2500. 

 

>“I’m sure I’ll get my comeuppance too, some day.”

**INNATE - SURVIVOR’S GUILT**: Adelaide’s secondary bar is Guilt, which goes up to 100. When she uses abilities, she can gain a certain amount of Guilt. Abilities that would make her exceed 100 Guilt instead cap out at 100. 

For every 10 Guilt, Adelaide’s basic attacks deal additional damage (+ 1-2% AD, based on level), and her critical hit damage is increased by 5%. 

After 10s outside of combat, Adelaide begins losing 1 Guilt every 2s for an initial 10s, and then 1 Guilt every 1s.

At 100 Guilt, Adelaide’s eyepatch burns away, revealing three red irises merged into one, embedded in her right eye. Adelaide can no longer use abilities that would make her gain Guilt (Q and W), and she no longer loses Guilt out of combat as usual. 

Her basic attacks are extended by +200 range, deal an additional flat +10% AD true damage, and have +20% crit-chance, but she takes true damage equal to 2% of her max health and is slowed by 40%, decaying over 2s, whenever she attacks. 

After 10s outside of combat at 100 Guilt, Adelaide begins losing Guilt as usual, taking 1% of her max health as true damage until she’s lost a total of 20% of her max health.

When she returns to her Nexus, Adelaide loses 20 Guilt. When she dies, Adelaide loses all her Guilt. 

 

>“For crimes of sedition and treachery against the Trifarix, I sentence you to death.”

**INNATE - NO LOOSE ENDS**: An ally at 20% of their max health or below can initiate a 2.5s channel with Adelaide (similar to Zilean’s passive), which she can confirm by clicking on the ally.

Adelaide executes the ally, denying gold to the enemy team. Both she and the executed ally get kill experience, but no gold, and this does not reset bounties. The executed ally’s respawn timer is halved. 

After the execution, Adelaide gains 40% bonus MS and is stealthed for 5s, or until she targets or is targeted by an enemy.

Adelaide gains 40 Guilt when executing an Ally at 0 or negative bounties, increased by 5 for every positive bounty tier. Adelaide cannot execute an ally if it would make her Guilt go beyond 100. 

 

>**“Complete the mission. At any cost.”**

**BASIC ATTACK - FINISH THE JOB**: When attacking enemy champions from stealth or out of their view, or after using certain abilities, Adelaide can consume 10 Guilt (if available) to empower her basic attacks. 

Her basic attacks slow down to 0.5  (Adelaide must wait 2s before she can basic attack again). Their range is doubled, and they deal additional true damage equal to (0.25-1% missing health + 1-2% AD, based on level) for every 10 Guilt Adelaide has when shooting. 

If the target is revealed, they are also silenced for 1s. At 100 Guilt, enemy champions are not silenced, but suppressed for 0.75s instead. 

 

**SUPPRESSIVE FIRE**

COOLDOWN: 8/7.5/7/6.5/6.

RANGE: 800/850/900/950/1000.

MISSILE SPEED: 1600.

Q Spell - Adelaide fires a shot that grants sight over it’s flight and pierces through enemies, dealing small physical damage (20/40/60/80/100 + 15% AD) and stopping at the first enemy champion hit, dealing slightly increased physical damage (30/50/70/90/110 + 30% AD) and revealing them for 2.5s. 

Firing the first round generates 5 Guilt. If the round hits an enemy champion, it initiates a 2s window where Suppressive Fire can be recast before going on cooldown. 

Suppressive Fire can be recast so long as Adelaide hits a champion and is not at 100 Guilt. Every time, the recast window is reduced by 0.25s. 

Recast: Adelaide fires another round, which generates 3 Guilt for every ally the shot goes through. 

If the first enemy champion hit is currently revealed, the shot slows them by 20/25/30/35/40 (+ 2 for every 100 AP) %, decaying over 2s, and reduces the target’s vision by 100 units for 2s. Every successive shot on the same champion increases the slow by 5% (up to 20% above the initial slow) and limited vision by 50 (up to 300 units of reduced vision), resetting the duration on both, as well as extending the revealing effect by 1s.

  

**SACRIFICE PLAY**

>“My orders come first.”

COOLDOWN: 16/15/14/13/12.

RANGE: 1200 (enemy)/1600 (ally).

SPEED: 1200.

W Spell - Adelaide initiates a move channel and begins sliding (think of Kled’s R) towards a target (either a champion, objective monster or structure), ghosting and becoming untargetable as she does. If she encounters terrain, she is interrupted and stunned for 0.75s. 

Every champion she passes through is slowed by 20/25/30/35/40 (+ 2 per 100 AP)%, decaying over 2s, or half as much for allied champions. For every allied champion she slides through, she generates 5 Guilt (if this would put her at 100 Guilt or over, she is interrupted and stunned for 0.75s, as per colliding with terrain). 

Adelaide cannot basic attack or use spells while sliding, except Suppressive Fire, which can be cast successively as usual. As soon as she fires the first shot of Suppressive Fire, she slows down to 800.

She can reactivate Sacrifice Play at any time to prematurely end the spell, but gets none of the following benefits. 

Once she arrives at her target, she gains 40% MS for 2s, and empowers her next basic attack with \[Finish the Job\]. Should the target she is sliding to be a champion, this one is knocked back by 400 upon arrival and, should said target be an ally, Adelaide generates an additional 10 Guilt.

 

**PILLBOX DEPLOYMENT**

COOLDOWN: 40/47.5/45/42.5/30.

RANGE: 400.

E Spell - Adelaide channels for 2.5s, before throwing a flare that calls down a mobile bunker drop after an additional 2.5s. The pillbox is a 300x200 structure that must be summoned inside a bush, or adjacent to a wall or structure. It has 300-500 health (+ 100% AP) based on level. If the structure it is attached to is destroyed, the pillbox is destroyed as well. 

Adelaide and allies can walk into the pillbox. While inside, they are granted 10/15/20/25/30 (+ 5% AP) Armor and MR while inside, and 40% MS for 5s should they remain for longer than 2.5s inside. For every second an ally or Adelaide herself is not inside a pillbox, it loses 3 health. 

The pillbox grants sight inside of it and acts like a bush, obstructing the vision of the enemy team. Enemy champions that try to cross it are slowed by 60% as they do. 

Adelaide’s basic attacks against enemy champions are empowered with \[Finish the Job\] for as long as she remains inside the pillbox, but she generates 2 Guilt per second. When she moves out of the pillbox and would be granted MS, she is also Invisible for the duration. 

At 100 Guilt, Adelaide no longer gains any benefits from staying inside a pillbox. 

Adelaide can only have up to 1/2/2/3/3 pillboxes summoned on the map at a time, and summoning one in excess will destroy the oldest pillbox. She can also repair a damaged pillbox by 300 if she casts this spell on it. 

 

**ZERO-SUM OPERATION**

>**“Burn away all doubt; the mission must come first.”**

COOLDOWN: 140/130/120.

R Spell - Adelaide halts her movement and begins channeling, up to 2s. She creates a 2000/2250/2500 long/250 wide AoE, whose width increases by 50 with every 0.2s of channeling. At the end of the channel, or after recasting Zero-Sum Operation, Adelaide fires a cursed shot that ricochets between targets within the AoE, consuming 10 Guilt per target, which include champions, whether friend or foe, objective monsters and pillboxes, going from closest to farthest.

The shot initially deals (200/300/400 + 50% AD) physical damage, but every time it bounces it increases in damage by (+ 10% AD). 

All targets, whether friend or foe, are slowed by 20/30/40% (+ 2 per 100 AP)%, which decays over 1s. Enemy champions are silenced for 1s. If Adelaide used this ability at 100 Guilt, enemy champions are not silenced, but suppressed for 0.75s instead. 

 

**Rationale behind abilities**:

* Guilt: At low Guilt, Adelaide has lower damage than most ADCs, but she can execute her allies to deny enemies gold and generate Guilt fast. At high Guilt, you’re skirting the razor’s edge: you’ll have +30% AD on auto-attacks and 200% Crit Damage with a flat 20% chance to crit, not to mention additional range, but at any moment you risk hitting 100 Guilt. When you do, you’ll deal massive damage, but you won’t be able to use Q or W to run away or slow your enemies. To lower your Guilt, hit an enemy with Q to reduce their range or run up to them with W, and pop them open with Finish the Job basic attacks. 
* Q spell: Use Suppressive Fire in lane to clear waves, peek into bushes and jungle to mitigate the chances of getting ganked. If you hit an enemy champion, capitalize by going into a bush and hitting a Finish the Job to reduce your Guilt if high and silence them long enough for your support to hook them, or keep Suppressive Fire going to push them back. While roaming, use Suppressive Fire to scout out enemy jungle camps, and harass them with Finish the Job. In teamfights, stand in the back of the composition to generate Guilt fast with Suppressive Fire and prevent hard engage. 
* W spell: Use Sacrifice Play in lane to retreat whenever you’re in too deep back to your support or a pillbox you’ve deployed, or use to catch up to an opponent who’s left alone and push them back towards your support. They’ll be slowed, and you can pop them open with Finish the Job. While roaming or to engage teamfights, use Suppressive Fire to slow down pursuers and disappear into the jungle or retreat behind allies.
* E spell: Use Pillbox Deployment to summon a structure in bushes, under towers or to block potential ganks. In lane, hide inside your pillbox when you’re being pushed and harass your opponents, as well as to gain Guilt quickly for high damage (especially early on). If the wave breaches under your tower, you can exit while stealthed. Later in the game, you can use pillboxes to obscure sight from your enemy and create chokeholds on objectives. 
* R spell: Use Zero-Sum Operation when you’re exiting a fight and have gained enough Guilt, or you’re at 100 Guilt and you need to leave. Be careful not to wait too long, because you might end up hindering your allies more than helping them. Ideally, you can lead a group of enemies into a trap by using Sacrifice Play and sliding into your team, slowing your pursuers down with Suppressive Fire, before using Zero-Sum Operation to deal massive damage and prevent them from escaping. 

 

**Tips to play as/against**:

* As Adelaide: Keep an eye on your Guilt, don’t let it get to 100 or you’ll be out of escape options; which’ll mean death unless you’re able to deal enough damage to kill your pursuers. Be aware of enemy vision and how fog of war shapes information, and you’ll be able to deal devastating Finish the Job basic attacks. Look at the map and stay in touch with your allies to deny the enemy team by executing them, or set up pillboxes to prevent pursuit. 
* Against Adelaide: Do not let her out of sight. As soon as she has generated enough Guilt, she will try to leave your vision and kill you with Finish the Job. Use wards to stay aware of her position, and terrain to prevent her escape with Sacrifice Play. Escaping Suppressive Fire and Zero-Sum Operation doesn’t just avoid damage, it prevents her balancing her Guilt. She will always have a range advantage at 100 Guilt, and will deal massive damage when hitting you. If you’re not confident you can kill her at 100 Guilt before she kills you, remember that she has no option to keep you still: you can try to slow or stun her and ditch her, let her take damage while she loses some Guilt, then finish her off. 

 

**Inspirations**:

Adelaide is obviously experimental as a champion kit. She might be overloaded, and I need help with that, but she initially was even more complicated. I wanted a Champion that could execute her allies to deny gold to the enemy team, but I needed a limit, so I introduced Guilt, which was originally a percent meter for every ally.

Adelaide was originally a grisly survivor whose hands were red with her allies' blood, but I also wanted to include her in Swain's backstory, because the poor chap doesn't have a lot of friends in lore (seriously half of all Noxus is Black Rose it seems), and eventually she became the Lt. Hawkeye to Jericho's Colonel Mustang.

The idea of a spy/secret police that's riddled with Guilt but pushed on by duty is something I eventually settled on, and I like to imagine the contrast with Adelaide's personality as the more rigid no nonsense persona she puts on while on duty vs her more mellow, coffee in a bookshop-type personality when more vulnerable. I intended to write some more lore about her, but that's WIP for now.

[Lore/Voice lines WIP.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nep-1VgfMF4HM-eKStEJsrqij4FVz5gPEz9uVyIp6WA/edit?usp=sharing)

 

If possible, I'd like some advice as to how to make her kit more cohesive/feasible.

**Possible changes**: 

* Changes to Pillbox Deployment so that she isn’t automatically empowered with Finish the Job basic attacks, but only when she’s inside the pillbox and hidden from enemies. Enemies can then ward the pillbox to reveal her and stop her from pinning them down. 
* Changes to Sacrifice Play to remove the next basic attack being empowered with Finish the Job. 
* Have low Guilt provide movement speed bonus so she can move around the map and execute allies, so that high Guilt makes Adelaide slower. 
* Is the range/damage good?
* How easy it is to manage Guilt, should be hard but not inevitable.
* Can No Loose Ends be implemented better? 
* Making it less complex, what can be removed while keeping the kit the same?",3,1734658772.0,LoLChampConcepts,0,1.0,False

**SPOILER WARNING: Since this is a rewatch, it's assumed that anyone in these discussions has already seen the entire show, so all spoilers are allowed.**


Day 88 brings us to ""Pink Champagne on Ice,"" which sends the team to the body of a man, Ryan Destefano, shot at close range on Highway 49. Jane notices there are two drinks in the car, and they go to a place called the Golden Fox Casino after Cho finds a chip in his pocket. While Lisbon and Cho talk to the head of security, Jane spots a poster for a show going on by magician Jack Hellion and sneaks off. He interrupts the man's act and causes him to screw up. Jack punches Jane in the nose. (the second punch in three episodes!)


Title relevance: ""Pink champagne on ice"" is apparently a line from the Eagles song ""Hotel California,"" but I'm not sure how it ties in with the episode.


Location: San Refugio


Notable guest stars: Christopher Backus (from Bosch), Christopher Judge (from Stargate SG-1!), Rodney Rowland (Ed Jerse from X-Files, Scully's one-night stand!)

Notable scenes: 
- Backstage, Jane catches up with Jack, who can't believe that Jane works with the CBI. He also apparently hasn't heard about what happened to his family, and Jane doesn't fill him in.
- Lisbon sends the team off to chase leads, and Jane says he's hungry and runs off. Turns out he goes to have a chat with the casino owner, who is reportedly mobbed up.
- The team figures out that the prints on the second drink in the car belonged to a Holly Danvers. Cho and Rigsby head to a trailer park to talk to Holly but find her roommate dead inside.
- At the casino, Jane enjoys Jack's show while other audience members mostly look at their phones. Backstage, Jane walks in on a meeting between Jack, his assistant, and two suspicious-looking men. Jane figures out that Jack is planning a casino heist and confronts him. Jack tells him that his girlfriend Holly has been kidnapped and is being forced to rob the casino. He offers to help.
- Rigsby notices Cho leaving with a dozen roses, and Cho tells him they're for Summer.
- Jane plans the heist with Jack and his crew, then shows up at the CBI office to tell the team all about his ""crazy idea,"" which puts them all on edge. In the end, Lisbon says she'll go along with it.
- Jane successfully pulls off the heist but allows the two accomplices to be arrested by Cho and Rigsby just as he and Jack leave. 
- Jane and Jack head to the drop to get Holly back, and the culprit turns out to be the magician's assistant Trish. She asks to see the money, but Lisbon bursts out of the box with her gun.
- Jack thanks Jane, and then the two continue their verbal sparring while Lisbon takes Holly to go get coffee.

1hi8kny,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hi8kny/tk02_online_negative_feedback/,TK-02 Online Negative Feedback,"First of all, I am very aware of the fairly widespread negative opinion of the TK-02 on this sub-Reddit. I just have some questions regarding some of the negative comments I have seen. 

Grind size: Many have reported it doesn’t appear to grind as fine as other super autos. Is there actually definite evidence that this machine doesn’t grind as fine as others? Everything I have seen are comments on pictures of pucks stating the grinds look course. When I look at the pictures compared to others I honestly am unable to tell a difference. Not saying they’re wrong, but is there any definite proof beyond picture comparisons? I have also seen comments that super autos shouldn’t grind as fine as semi autos or manual anyways because it pulls at a higher pressure and prevents clogging? Is there truth to that?

Milk temp: This seems to be a problem with other super autos too? Not just the TK-02? Why do the others get a pass in the super-autos category for this but the TK-02 doesn’t?

Espresso temp: Some say it is not hot enough. Reviews on other machines often say the same. Like the milk temp, is this an issue with all super autos? If so is the TK-02 that much worse than others?

Inability to customize drinks: This seems to have been largely resolved with firmware updates? You can set a specific espresso profile for each drink now. Can change dose up to 14g, grind size, water volume, and temp. Is it still worse than others?

Ghost brew: Does this still happen? Lots of firmware updates since the early complaints about this.

Drip coffee brew size: First of all I am well aware that it is not real drip coffee. I can understand the annoyance with their marketing here, but it really doesn’t bother me since it is fairly easy to learn that it isn’t real drip with very little research into the machine. There were complaints about the max volume on early reviews. Recent updates have increased the volume for this to 455 mL. 

UI sucks and is difficult to use: Went to Williams Sonoma and played with the UIs of a Z10, E8 and Eletta Explore and wasn’t impressed with any of them. The Z10 was the worst. The TK02 seems to be pretty well thought out and more user friendly? Is it really as bad as some say?

It’s a re-packaged $400 machine from china and up charged: Okay so I understand this was the case for the 01… but I have seen comments stating this isn’t the case for the TK-02 and others say that it is still? Do we really know? Any verdict on this? 

Am I missing anything else? I’m not trying to make a pitch for the TK-02 here. But I’m just trying to understand the negative feedback better and to understand if it is really THAT bad.

1hi8km9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HydrogenWaterFast/comments/1hi8km9/the_comprehensive_guide_to_how_much_water_in_a/,The Comprehensive Guide To How Much Water In A Day Should I Drink And Its Benefits,"The Ideal Water Intake: How Much Water in a Day Should You Drink?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for our bodies, but how much water in a day should you drink to stay hydrated? The answer isn't one-size-fits-all, as various factors can influence your ideal water intake. In this guide, we’ll explore the factors determining your hydration needs, how to calculate your daily water consumption, and the numerous benefits of drinking enough water.

### Understanding Hydration Needs

Your daily water needs depend on several factors, including:

- **Age:** Water requirements can change as you grow older. Children may need less than adults, while older adults may need to be conscious of their fluid intake.
- **Gender:** Men generally require more water than women due to larger muscle mass and higher metabolic rates.
- **Activity Level:** If you exercise regularly or engage in physical labor, you will need more water to replace fluids lost through sweat.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather increases your fluid needs as your body works harder to regulate its temperature.
- **Health Conditions:** Certain medical conditions, like fever or infections, can raise your body's demand for fluids.

### How Much Water Should You Drink?

While there is no exact answer, a common guideline is the **8x8 rule**: drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, totaling about 2 liters or half a gallon. However, this may not fit everyone's needs. Instead, here’s a more tailored approach:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
#### Calculating Your Needs

A simple method to estimate your daily water intake is to follow these steps:

1. Weigh yourself in pounds.
2. Divide your weight by 2, which gives you the approximate number of ounces you should drink daily.
3. If you’re active, consider adding an additional 12-24 ounces for each hour of exercise.

For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, you should aim for about 75 ounces of water daily. If you exercise, increase that amount by 12-24 ounces depending on the duration and intensity of your workout.

### Listening to Your Body

Besides calculations, it’s crucial to listen to your body. Thirst is an obvious sign that you need water, but other indicators include:

- **Dark Urine:** If your urine is dark yellow, it might be time to sip more.
- **Dry Mouth:** A dry mouth can indicate dehydration.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired could be linked to inadequate hydration.

### Benefits of Staying Hydrated

Drinking the right amount of water each day has several important benefits:

- **Enhanced Physical Performance:** Staying hydrated improves your energy levels and prevents fatigue during physical activities.
- **Better Digestion:** Water helps digest food and prevents constipation.
- **Joint Lubrication:** Water is necessary for lubricating your joints, which can help alleviate discomfort.
- **Healthy Skin:** Adequate hydration keeps your skin looking healthy and vibrant.
- **Temperature Regulation:** Drinking enough water aids your body in regulating its temperature, especially during exercise or in hot weather.

### Tips for Increasing Water Intake

If you struggle to drink enough water, here are some practical tips:

- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keeping a reusable water bottle with you can serve as a reminder to drink more.
- **Set Reminders:** Use alarms or apps to remind yourself to drink water throughout the day.
- **Infuse Your Water:** Add fruits, herbs, or vegetables to your water for flavor and added nutrients.

Understanding how much water in a day you should drink can promote a healthier lifestyle. By paying attention to your body’s signals, calculating your needs, and making hydration a priority, you are taking important steps to support your overall well-being.

Understanding the Effects of Hydration on Your Health
-----------------------------------------------------

When it comes to health and wellness, one of the most essential elements is hydration. Drinking enough water each day can greatly impact your overall health and wellbeing. So, what are the effects of hydration on your health? Let’s explore this vital aspect of our lives.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Staying hydrated helps to maintain the balance of bodily fluids. About 60% of your body is made up of water, and this fluid plays a crucial role in numerous bodily functions. These include:

- Regulating body temperature
- Transporting nutrients
- Managing digestion
- Establishing skin health
- Maintaining joint lubrication

As you can see, water is not just something to drink; it is integral to how your body operates. Consistently drinking enough water can significantly boost your energy levels and increase your productivity. When you are well-hydrated, your body performs better and mentally, you can focus with greater clarity.

The importance of hydration extends to physical activity as well. During exercise, you lose water through sweat, which can lead to dehydration if not replenished. This can cause fatigue and decrease your performance. Studies show that even a slight drop in hydration can affect your endurance and strength. Staying hydrated while working out helps to keep your body cool and minimizes the risk of cramps and injuries.

Hydration also has a notable impact on your skin. Well-hydrated skin appears more plump and vibrant. Water helps to keep your skin moisturized and can even reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Many skincare experts recommend drinking sufficient water to promote better skin health, as it helps to flush out toxins that could lead to blemishes.

Another area where hydration plays a crucial role is in digestion. Drinking enough water aids in the breakdown of food so that your body can absorb nutrients effectively. Sufficient water intake prevents constipation and supports a healthy digestive system. It can also help to alleviate symptoms of bloating and acid reflux by diluting stomach acids.

In addition to these bodily functions, good hydration supports mental health. Dehydration can lead to irritability and fatigue, both of which can create a negative loop affecting your mood. On the other hand, staying well-hydrated helps to improve your mood, cognition, and overall mental clarity. This is particularly important for students and professionals who rely on focus and concentration in their daily tasks.

How much water should you drink daily? While the “8 x 8 rule” (eight 8-ounce glasses of water) is a common guideline, the truth is that individual hydration needs can vary based on several factors. These include age, body size, climate, and levels of physical activity. Generally, hydration should meet your body’s demands throughout the day, encouraging you to drink water when you feel thirsty.

Here are some tips to increase your daily water intake:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
1. **Carry a reusable water bottle:** Keeping water within reach makes it easier to remember to drink.
2. **Set reminders:** Use your phone or a smart device to alert you to drink water at regular intervals.
3. **Infuse water with flavor:** Adding fruits or cucumbers can make drinking water more enjoyable.
4. **Eat water-rich foods:** Fruits and vegetables like cucumbers, oranges, and watermelon contribute to hydration.

The benefits of hydration are clear, and it affects nearly every aspect of your health. Whether you are aiming to improve your physical performance, mental focus, or skin health, drink plenty of water throughout your day. Remember to listen to your body and adjust your intake based on your unique needs. Hydration is more than just a matter of drinking; it’s a fundamental component of a healthy lifestyle.

Common Myths About Water Consumption Debunked
---------------------------------------------

Water is essential for our health, yet there are many misconceptions about how much we should drink and what it can do for us. Let’s dive into some common myths about water consumption and uncover the truth behind them.

### Myth 1: You Need to Drink Eight Glasses of Water a Day

One of the most common myths is that you must drink eight glasses of water daily. While this guideline is easy to remember, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. The amount of water each person needs varies based on several factors, including:

- Your age
- Your gender
- Your level of physical activity
- The climate you live in
- Your overall health

A more personalized approach is to listen to your body; thirst is often a reliable indicator of when you need to hydrate.

### Myth 2: Drinking More Water Means Better Health

While staying hydrated is vital for overall health, drinking excessive amounts of water can be harmful. This condition, known as water intoxication or hyponatremia, occurs when the sodium levels in your body become dangerously low due to excessive water intake. It can lead to serious health issues, including:

- Headaches
- Nausea
- Confusion
- Seizures

It’s essential to find a balance and not overdo it. Moderation is key.

### Myth 3: Coffee and Tea Don’t Count Towards Hydration

Many people believe that caffeinated beverages dehydrate you. However, studies have shown that coffee and tea can contribute to your daily fluid intake. While caffeine is a mild diuretic, normal consumption doesn’t negate hydration benefits. So, if you enjoy your morning coffee or a soothing cup of tea, you can still count them towards your daily water intake.

### Myth 4: All Fluids Are Equal

It’s easy to think that all fluids hydrate equally, but this isn’t true. Some drinks can actually dehydrate you. For instance, sugary sodas and alcoholic beverages can lead to increased urination, countering their hydrating effects. The best options for hydration are:

- Pure water
- Herbal teas
- Coconut water

These choices not only hydrate but also provide additional health benefits without the pitfalls of added sugars or alcohol.

### Myth 5: You Can’t Drink Too Much Water

Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to drink too much water. Over-hydration can lead to a dangerous dilution of electrolytes in the blood. Always monitor your body’s signals. If you feel bloated or uncomfortably full, it might be a sign that you’ve had enough for the moment.

### Myth 6: You Should Only Drink When You're Thirsty

While thirst is a helpful guide, it's not always the best indicator of hydration needs, especially for older adults. As people age, their sense of thirst may diminish, increasing the risk of dehydration. To maintain optimal hydration, make a habit of drinking water at regular intervals throughout the day, even if you don’t feel thirsty.

### Myth 7: If You're Active, You Only Need Water

While water is crucial for hydration, it’s not the only element needed for those engaging in high levels of physical activity. Electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, play a significant role in maintaining balance in the body. Sports drinks or electrolyte-infused water can be beneficial during prolonged exercise sessions, especially in hot weather.

Understanding these common myths about water consumption can help you make informed choices about your hydration needs. Aim to drink an adequate amount of water suited to your individual lifestyle, listen to your body, and remember that balance is crucial. Not all fluids are created equal, and moderation is essential for effective hydration.

Recognizing Signs of Dehydration and How to Combat It
-----------------------------------------------------

Dehydration can sneak up on you, and its signs may not always be obvious. It's essential to recognize the symptoms early to ensure you stay healthy and hydrated. When you lose more water than you take in, your body cannot function optimally. Understanding the signs helps you take immediate action.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Common Signs of Dehydration

- **Dry Mouth and Thirst:** If you feel thirsty or have a dry mouth, it's a classic early sign that your body is running low on water.
- **Dark Yellow Urine:** Generally, light yellow urine indicates hydration. Dark yellow or amber urine suggests concentration and may signal dehydration.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or lacking energy could mean your body doesn’t have enough fluid to function efficiently.
- **Headaches:** Dehydration can lead to headaches. If you’re experiencing frequent headaches, consider your fluid intake.
- **Dizziness or Lightheadedness:** Insufficient hydration might make you feel dizzy when standing up or moving quickly.
- **Dry Skin:** If your skin feels dry or lacks elasticity, it could be a sign that you need more water.
- **Muscle Cramps:** Inadequate hydration can cause muscle cramps, especially during exercise.
- **Rapid Heartbeat:** Pay attention to your heart rate; dehydration can cause it to increase as your body tries to maintain blood pressure.

### Causes of Dehydration

Understanding what causes dehydration can help you be more vigilant. Here are some common causes:

- **Heat and Humidity:** High temperatures cause you to sweat more, leading to fluid loss.
- **Physical Activity:** Exercise increases your need for hydration, especially if you are not replenishing fluids lost during workouts.
- **Illness:** Fever, vomiting, or diarrhea can quickly deplete your body's water reserves.
- **Diet:** High-protein or high-sugar foods may increase your hydration needs, while excessive caffeine or alcohol can have a dehydrating effect.

### How to Combat Dehydration

Staying hydrated doesn’t have to be a complicated process. Here are some simple steps you can follow:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Drink Plenty of Water:** Aim for at least 8 cups (64 ounces) of water a day. Adjust for exercise and temperature conditions.
- **Eat Water-Rich Foods:** fruits and vegetables like cucumbers, watermelon, and oranges can boost your hydration.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone or apps to remind you to drink water throughout the day.
- **Monitor Your Urine:** Keep an eye on the color of your urine. Aim for a light yellow shade.
- **Hydration Packs:** For prolonged activities or travel, consider using hydration packs or electrolyte drinks to maintain fluid balance.

### Special Considerations

Specific groups may need to be more cautious about their hydration levels. For instance:

- **Elderly Individuals:** Age can reduce the sense of thirst, so encourage regular fluid intake.
- **Children:** Keep an eye on kids during play, especially in hot weather, to prevent dehydration.
- **Pregnant or Nursing Women:** Increased hydration needs are crucial for both mothers and their babies.

### When to Seek Medical Attention

If you experience severe signs of dehydration like extreme thirst, confusion, or fainting, seek medical help immediately. Severe dehydration requires medical treatment, often through intravenous fluids.

Staying hydrated is vital for your health. By recognizing the signs of dehydration and knowing how to combat it, you can ensure you maintain optimal hydration levels, helping your body to function at its best.

Remember, your body is always sending signals about its hydration status. Listen to those signals and stay proactive about your water intake.

### Set Clear Goals

One effective way to ensure you are drinking enough water is to set a daily goal. You might aim for eight 8-ounce glasses, known as the ""8x8 rule,"" or adjust that based on your body weight and activity level. To make tracking easier, consider:

- Using a water tracking app on your smartphone.
- Keeping a water bottle nearby to count your intake more easily.

- Is lightweight and portable.
- Has measurements marked on the side to visualize your consumption.

- Infusing herbs like mint or basil for a refreshing twist.
- Using a splash of 100% fruit juice for flavor without added sugar.

Staying adequately hydrated has a profound impact on your physical and mental health, affecting everything from energy levels to cognitive function.

It's essential to bust common myths surrounding hydration, such as the belief that you must drink exactly eight glasses every day. Instead, focus on your body's signals and adjust your water intake accordingly. Being aware of signs of dehydration, such as dry mouth, fatigue, or headache, can help you identify when you need to drink more fluids.

So, I’ve had a crush on this girl at my gym for years. She’s super low-key—comes in, does her cardio on the machines furthest away from everyone, and leaves. She doesn’t interact with anyone, which initially made me wonder if she’s just very private or possibly not into guys. I know it’s not my business, but when you’ve been silently crushing on someone, your brain can’t help but overanalyze.

What throws me off is her outfits. They’re pretty bold—like, they catch attention—but her demeanor is the opposite. She seems to actively avoid people, which makes it feel contradictory. I noticed she had a male trainer for a short time, but that didn’t last long. Other than that, she’s basically a ghost in the gym.

Here’s where I feel like I might be overthinking things: I know her sister from way back when we worked retail together. Recently  saw her with her partner (they were affectionate, so it was obvious) at a coffee shop, and I overheard them talking about being sisters with the gym crush there too. Knowing her sister is a lesbian made me curious—does that mean she might not be into guys too? Of course, I realize that’s a dumb assumption on its own, but it’s hard not to wonder when I’ve seen her around for so long yet know nothing about her.

I’ve wanted to say hi to her for years but never worked up the nerve. I even switched gyms at one point to try and move on, but then one random day I went back, and there she was again. It feels like the universe is messing with me.  

Am I completely overthinking this? I realize her sister’s orientation has nothing to do with hers, but I can’t stop my brain from jumping to conclusions. At this point, it’s less about whether she’s into guys and more about how to stop overanalyzing someone I barely know.

Any advice on how to handle this, or how to just move on from a crush I’ve had for way too long? Next time I'll see her I'll start a convo ",1,1734657748.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

I live in an apartment so they had no idea which unit I was in, and use an alias on FB marketplace so they couldn't use the directory.

I am 16 years old, My father has a friend, I haven't seen him for a long time.... Anyway at the 1st meeting such a joker, very nice etc. He hugged at the end even though I wanted to shake hands.
At the 2nd meeting he was also very nice, making me feel special, e.g. that supposedly no one had ever asked him for sugar for coffee and that I had to be confident, he chose the flavour of the ice cream according to my favourite colour because he asked me what colours were my favourite, some jokes only in my direction even though my father and brother behaved the same way, etc. He also told me that I had to be sure of myself.
He stroked me twice as he passed then stopped and stroked me....
He commissioned a painting of cats from me, nice contact, first he asked if I could paint it for him etc.
I painted for 6 days, I tried very hard and when I finished the painting I sent it for evaluation, whether to improve etc.
And he ignored it, didn't reply and the next morning he sent 2 paintings including one erotically oriented with a woman naked with handcuffs around her hands. And he didn't ask if I could paint it, he just wrote that I was to get acquainted and I was to paint it.
It has been two months since this situation, I wrote a reminder message on Monday with this picture of cats and he read it after a few minutes and ignores it again.
I would like to mention that he has been telling my father for two months that the painting (of the cats) is beautiful and that he will order another one from me, that it is great and that he will pick it up, but he does not know how to answer me briefly and to the point, he just ignores me. And he was so nice, when I wrote that I was starting to paint the picture I wrote that it was great and he would surely be proud of my work.
I'm very sad; I don't know what it's about... feels confusion.... I put all my heart into this work.",0,1734657373.0,AskMenAdvice,35,0.4,False

1hi85vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Men/comments/1hi85vz/1_year_since_filing/,1 Year Since Filing,"I'm not really looking for a lot of response on this. This is more of a cathartic post than anything else. It's a long one but still not everything. Skip it if you're looking to solve someone's problem. It's just a dump.

On December 19, 2023, I (M56) filed for divorce. Happy anniversary, me. I have not laid eyes on my STBX (F53) since September 29th, 2023. On September 30th, I was starting the day to help my adult children (26F and 24M) into a townhouse together with the son's GF. My daughter still lived at home and was the last one to leave the nest. My STBX had left early that morning for her usual weekend nursing shift (7a-7p) and I'd arrived home late from a business trip so I didn't see her. I went looking for the oatmilk coffee creamer I'd bought the week before and came up short. That's where it all took a left turn.

I looked in the kitchen fridge and the garage fridge but it was nowhere to be found so I sent a text to the group asking if anyone knew where it had gone. My son walked in the door that minute and said the STBX had given it to them for their apartment. That pissed me off because just the week before she had been loading them up with stuff for their new place and had thrown in some items I was still using. At that time, I'd politely asked everyone not to transfer anything else unless they checked with me... just as a courtesy. So the creamer being given away felt like a big ""F U"" to me. I sent a (still) polite text to the group and asked again for checking before gifting. I literally used the word ""please"". The ""kids"" were apologetic, said they'd return it, etc, but I said just let it go.

My STBX, on the other hand, began flaming me in a private text. I said that it did make me feel unimportant in my own house but that I was over it. I had things to do that day. (From work,) She kept going about embarassing her in front of our adult children, but I stopped responding. We did all of the moving. Fast forward to the evening when she was finished with her work shift... I received a text that said ""You better be gone when I get home."" I replied that she must be kidding. She assured me she was not, and I declined. I said that we could avoid each other until she cooled off in a 4k sq ft house. She informed me that she was making hotel reservations... but not before she came home, slamming doors, slamming luggage, tore an anchored cork board off of the wall, scared the dog so badly it climbed under me, and sped off. Except for about 15 minutes to repack one day, she stayed gone a week.

When I left on my next business trip, she returned home. As I was flying away on my birthday, she let me know that she would be consulting a counselor and an attorney the next morning and ""let me know"" what would happen next. She spent the 3 next days in the home, texting me angrily about what she didn't like about me. When I was on my scheduled flight home, she texted me the rules. She had moved all of my personal effects to the basement (man cave). Clothes, shoes, toiletries, etc. She'd set up the Keurig in the landing area there. She said I was not allowed on the main floor or the upper floor unless she was gone AND it was an emergency. She said she would walk around the block to get to the garage in the back so she didn't have to pass me in the basement. She suggested I get a microwave to put next to the coffee maker because I wasn't allowed to use her kitchen. She also suggested that if I didn't like it, I should get an apartment.

Over the next couple of weeks, it became clearer that she felt she was in a superior position. I found anniversary pictures in the garbage. I found gifts from me to her in a construction dumpster in the neighborhood. And she kept demanding conditions and scenarios. For about a month after that, she texted my extended family, telling the usual lies women tell about men when they want to countersue for ""cruel treatment"" grounds. The more I refused to do what she wanted, the more comabtive she became. She terrorized our adult children demanding their loyalty... well... except for our oldest (35M) because he'd already cut ties with her to protect his wife and children. She ""broke up"" with her oldest friend because she tried to talk sense into her re: our 35 year marriage, my contributions and patience toward providing her a comfortable lifestyle, etc. For that she accused her best friend of having an affair with me. At the same time, she spent hundreds of dollars via my credit cards on sex toys, scheduled an in-home masseuse and taunted me saying I paid for another mad to touch her in my home (she actually covered the Ring camera lens when he arrived and left), and she used our joint checking account to sign up for [elitesingles.com](http://elitesingles.com) only to find out you need a bachelors degree to participate (I waited a week to let her know I saw it at which time she claimed someone had hacked her email to sign up. Strangely, she sent me a screenshot of the profile page that was in Edit mode... for which you'd need creds used to create the accout to access). I finally told her that I haven't cared what she did with her vagina since the night I returned from my business trip and she'd moved my things to the basement.

I moved out on November 5th while she was at work. I rented the apartment like she suggested It sits halfway between my oldest son and the other two adult children who moved in together. During that first week, my daughter, son, his GF, and I had a cookout with her ex-best friend and her husband (of 10 years). I'd recommended that they turn off Location Services on their phones but they hadn't seen the crazy I'd seen so far and left it on. When I was about to take my first bite of steak, the STBX began ringing the doorbell of her ex-best friend's house like a pinball machine. We figured out later that her vehicle was not operational and she'd walked the 1.5 miles from our townhouse to our friends' house partially on a busy, dark, country road with no shoulder. When no one immediately opened the door for her, she began knocking aggressively, and eventually just tried to open the door herself. I have a Ring video of this. It was locked so she marched around to the back deck stairs close to which we were all seated inside. When the friend's husband denied her entry, she stomped back down the deck stairs and upended his still smoking charcoal grill into a pile of leaves next to his house. The friend's husband hurried to deal with it and my youngest son yelled after her from the deck. She didn't respond. The texts flew all night from there while all of us in the house tried to calm things down and support each other. The STBX first apologized to our children, then got ugly when the youngest agreed that she didn't behave well. I retained an attorney over the next week.

On December 18th, 2023, I was on another business trip and talked to my youngest son in the evening. He let me know that the STBX had invited herself into their townhouse in one of the evenings preceding and followed him around his kitchen, clutching her purse up in front of her, and badgering him to side with her against me. I think this went on for an hour. The GF thought it was odd that the STBX kept pushing her purse in front of her throughout the ""conversation"" and thought she must be recording it... so the GF decided to record it herself. They shared it with me on the night of the 19th. It was a lot of dramatic tripe that had no legal bearing on anything so none of us understand why she would be recording it other than to seek her own vindication. A week or so after that, she called my son's GF individually, and after she assured the STBX my son wasn't home (he was and she was on speaker so he heard every word), began to trash the youngest son as a loser and told the GF to ""use him for everything she could get out of him and dump him"".

That actually pissed me off so much that I filed for divorce while out-of-state at the quarterly business meeting. Our company general counsel actually notarized the complaint for me, which I promptly scanned and sent to my attorney. My STBX was on a Christmas trip to NYC when she was served through her attorney.

That was a year ago. Plenty else went on during that time. PLENTY else has happened since, but I made sure to screenshot every text conversation we had privately and in group, the conversations she had with her ex-best friend and her husband, bank records of the sex toys, the massage, the dating site membership, pictures of the house and contents while she was in hotels that first week, the damage she caused to the house the night she left, the items she ""threw away"" but made sure I saw, etc, and included them all in our Discovery submissions.

She's dragged her feet at every turn. We've had one round of mediation which went so badly the mediator never brought me/us her starting point. My attorney has finished our side of the pre-trial consolidation order required by our county in GA and advised her attorney that the clock is ticking. Not long after the holidays, we will file for a motion to compel and hope to get her to participate in the divorce more quickly.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that she's on her 3rd attorney. Her first one quit her because of ""a conflict of interest"". He'd represented her half-sister. My STBX told me at the time (before our separation) that her half-sister and the attorney were sleeping together. Not sure how that evolves into a COI for my STBX though unless she also opted for the same payment plan... The second got caught up in a non-compete scenario regarding paralegals she brought with her to the firm my STBX retained after the first attorney. That attorney resigned the firm and the STBX started over. None of her attorneys have seemed to have had a good grasp on the details of our case.

That's where we are 1.5 years in and 1 year since filing. Your mileage may vary.",3,1734656688.0,Divorce_Men,3,1.0,False

(Warning: long mini rant/freakout below for optional context for those who enjpy reading)","I'm in the midst of planning my wedding.  I am not having jitters. Or maybe I am - but if I am, they are not related to my fiance! I love him sooooo much. He makes me the MOST happy. I am so lucky and so grateful that I met him. He's the best person I know. He's not perfect but he's perfect to me. 

I was up late last night wrapping presents and I binge watched a show called the White Lotus on HBO which kick started some serious relationship anxiety that i didnt know i had. It got me thinking about things I've never thought about and now I can't stop worrying about them. 

Are you still in love with your spouse? I guess that's my main question. My fiance and I are long past the need-to-have-sex-constantly phase of our relationship.  And we've definitely had our fair share of arguments. Like, enough things have gone wrong between he and i for it to feel right if that makes sense. 

We still have the spark. We're still in love. We're the bestest of friends. We have a healthy sex life and a healthy emotional relationship.  We are planning on dogs, not kids. I'm 37yo, he is 40yo. First marriage for us both. I have aspergers and I think I overwhelmed the men before him whereas he thinks every I say and do is hysterical. He's really great at making fun of me in a way thats deeply funny without being demeaning or cruel. The last meltdown i had was over the dishwasher and how I need him to properly stagger the ceramic bowls on the top rack when loading it. Oh, he had a field day with that one. 🤣

For his part, well...he's actually kinda picky which is ironic I know. He hates instability; he also hates being bored - enter a major development disorder 🤣. I've been in longer albeit fewer LTRs before him; and I honestly don't think he knows how many girls he's dated semi seriously. Lol poor guy.

What if he gets bored? What if I get bored? What if one of us loses interest in sex? I don't ever want to not be in love with him. And I don't ever want him to not be in love with me. Is it true that it goes away - the spark, the chemistry? It makes my stomach hurt to think about. Do you just wake up and it's gone? My biggest fear that I didn't even know I had until I watched the white lotus is that I might not always feel the way I do about him and/or vice versa. Nothing scares me more than that. Is it true it just fades? Do you have control over that and making sure that doesn't happen? All of this seemed impossible and never crossed my mind until Steve Zahn's midlife crisis on E3 of S1 of that stupid show. 

My previous breakups weren't over a lack of love or spark dying for me so much as they ""why is there a wheelbarrow in the living room and what did you do with my coffee table? Blah blah blah blah"" kind of situations that grew to be too much for the guy. I just accepted that was my lot in life. I'm generally too much. I dont mean to be but i dont know how to be any other way. But I dont think i ever had my heart broken. I think being broken up with made me feel sad and made me feel like i was a failure. But now as im thinking about it - they never hurt, not exactly. Not really. But the very thought of my fiance one day getting sick of me or vice versa makes my stomach physically twist. He not only accepts every single one of my eccentricities without demands for change, he seems to genuinely like me all the more for it. Which is the world's BEST feeling. 

We are each financially independent. We each make good money, we each have good credit. We each have a car. There's no glaring disparity between us except he's kind of a slut. Well, a reformed slut. But I also really like that about him? Lol. I sorta love everything about him past and present.

What do you do to stay happy and keep the other one happy? Are you happy? Is your spouse happy? Any pitfalls to be aware of that I could get ahead of?  ",1,1734656479.0,AskWomenNoCensor,5,0.6,False

1hi81it,https://www.reddit.com/r/Berghain_Community/comments/1hi81it/selectordoor_person_as_a_curator/,Selector/door person as a curator..,"Ive been thinking about this for a long time & I finally have the time to express it. I hope it is valuable to someone.

I have quite a bit of experience clubbing all over the world & Ive been to BH around 100 times (hard to count before the bracelets) & to K41 in Kyiv before & since the war started about 10 times or so.

My personal opinion is that the door person who selects the attendees should be treated like an art exhibition curator & be trained like they will be one. This means that they should be compensated very well & respected as one of the key individuals who make a party what it is.

I feel like even though there is a lot of recognition of who is working the door at BH on a given event the attitude of both the club & the attendees is not really one of “this person is very much responsible for the quality of the experience inside.”

I think part of this stems from the selectors not being compensated that well & from what I can tell being upskilled from people who bag check to selectors. That seems to me rather strange. If you get hired to make coffee at a company you don’t all of a sudden upgrade to being chief product officer. Because these two tasks require completely different experience/qualifications.

It makes more sense to me that a venue would look for people who would be great selectors (not bag checkers or beefy dudes who can withstand a drunk malicious person confronting them).

If that was the case & selectors were recognized more as curators one would naturally expect that each curator/selector would have their own vision of who should be inside & be recognized for it.

Rn it appears more that Sven sets the vision & the remaining staff selectors try to follow/interpret it to the best of their abilities, instead of having their own.

Each selector having their own unique vision would be less egalitarian but I think would raise the quality & diversity of the selection/attendees. It is also somewhat how it works often at underground parties who do a solid job.

I saw this in K41 before the war started w Andrei. You could tell when he was selecting the people inside matched his vision (not necessarily a generic underground club selection). It would be great if BH looked for these kinds of selectors/curators & treated them with this kind of respect/authority.

Another thing Ive noticed about great selectors outside of BH is that they have a conversation w the attendees before they select/reject them. I think when that works it’s a much better deal than the amount of interaction that takes place at the bh door on average.

It’s hard to select people either way but having a short conversation w them would likely lead to a better idea of who they are than only looking at them.

If selectors were hired to be curators this kind of interaction is much more likely to be high quality IMO than upskilling bag checkers & security whose job is to protect the door from inebriated agro folks & crazy people.

What do you think? Am I out of my mind here or selection could be better if selectors were selected, trained, and treated more like art curators than security?",0,1734656336.0,Berghain_Community,20,0.44,False

As i get older and older, i have less and less friends. Most of the people i used to hangout with online are the same age as me, and now have kids/spouses and in general a lot more going on in life then me. So i'm mostly just hanging out with myself! Which kinda sucks, tbh. So i'm just on the lookout for anyone that values spending time together, online. I miss sitting in calls, talking about whatever, watching stuff together on either discord screenshare, or plex. And just playing games in general. I have a ton of games, and i would love to play more. I'm not gonnas list any games since that's not the purpose of this post. This post is more to find someone that i can vibe with, someone i get along with. But it would be very good if you  played games.

But i'm gonna list some favorites of different kinds, so you somewhat get a feel for who i am?

* The movie Oldboy, been my favorite since it came out, so good.
* Bread. I do love bread, any type of bread tbh, it's not good for you but could easily live on it.
* Pepsi Max/Water/Coffee. I almost exclusively drink these 3 things.
* I do listen to a lot of music, but it's hard to describe? so heres my [last.fm](http://last.fm/user/zauron)
* Animals! An easy thing to love. I sadly don't have a cat anymore, but i'll adopt one soon again. I'm also very into Capybaras, they are amazing!
* Homelabbing. I have a \*erver which i tinker with a lot, running a bunch of services and just playing around with it, it's super fun!

That's some stuff atleast. I'm also kinda introverted, and my energy fluctuate quite a bit, so if i don't respond, don't take it personal!

Oh, and i'm located in Sweden. But any TZ is fine really, my sleep scheduele is all over the place!

Oh, and $MNT is giving major DeFi powerhouse energy. It’s up 62%, and honey, Mantle’s ecosystem is absolutely popping. Rewards so good, they’ve got me batting lashes at my wallet. 👛🚀  

But wait, let’s dive into $KAS. Quiet, cute, and ready to blow up with that juicy 10X growth potential. Call me obsessed, but Kaspa’s got ""hidden gem"" written all over it! 💎  

Last but not least, shoutout to $ALGO and $SEI holding it down for the steady-growers and strategic buyers. Their development game is strong, babes, and they might just surprise us all. 👀

My mom is sick with stage 3 breast cancer. It has been a hard journey to navigate for my mom, younger sister and I. I currently am paying my own way through nursing school and have a job at the local coffee shop but as most of you can guess, things are still severely tight when it comes to finances for myself. 

This past week my mom became ill with pneumonia which has put her in the hospital under 24 hour care as her immune system can not fight off this infection on its own as a result of her chemotherapy. I am not sure when or if she will get through this and that is a thought that is too heartbreaking and imaginable to digest at this time. 

While my mom is in the hospital I am taking care of my younger sister full time which comes with financial responsibilities. From groceries to every day living expenses I am having a hard time being able to provide in the way she needs and deserves. 

I know that it is the Holiday season and everyone is watching their spending but I thought I would humbly ask if anyone has any extra money they are able to donate to be put towards the welfare of my sister and I (I am mainly concerned about my sister) I would be so greatly appreciative. This is not fun to go online and ask strangers for money however my sister has been the one and only reason I am able to put my pride aside and reach out for help. 

 As I said, I am not getting my hopes up or expecting much to come from this post but if anyone see this that is in a position to help out, please feel free to message me privately or comment and I can reach out to you.

There is one thing that has slightly weirded us out - she eats our food. For context on this: we asked before she started doing house sits for us what would make her comfortable. I asked for any sort of food items / drinks / coffees etc she would want and purchased them in advance of any time she would do a sit. I told her she was welcome to all of these items and left them in a specific part of the fridge / pantry. She never touched any of them and actually told us specifically she would go back to her apt (around 3 blocks away) for lunch and dinner for herself and to visit her cats. We meal prep a lot of freezer meals and other items so these were pretty much the only other things in the fridge. On her last visit, I saw on the ring doorbell that when she left, she took a freezer bag with most of our prepped meals with her. I’m sort of at a loss for what to do because she is SO good with our dog and have no issue with providing her food for her stay but it feels odd to us that she would specifically take these which we implied was sort of “off limits” and not anything else that was asked for.

This isn’t a happy story. It’s just... painful. Painful not due to some grotesque detail leaving you struggling to finish the paragraph, but painful because this isn’t how it was supposed to end. When two souls find each other in the blurry fog that carries itself throughout their lives, their shared connection and love blazing bright, the fire is not supposed to die. It’s rekindled continuously by the passions, dreams, struggles, and a life shared between the two souls. But the fire is out now, and no amount of rekindling can grow it again. The blinding light of the unknown that lay before us cannot be dimmed, and with each passing step the trail behind us fades further into the dark, never to be seen again. The fleeting moments we once took for granted, believing there would always be many more, were soon overshadowed by the sins that broke it all down. Everyone has their obvious regrets from past misdeeds. When two souls drift apart and find new love, they often regret everything that came before for getting in the way. He doesn’t regret any of it. He loved wholly and deeply and would never want to remember it any other way.

Their relationship was that of love, connection, and companionship, paired with challenges, missteps, and struggles. They began together in Fall 2016, and it all ended in Fall 2024. He (29M), a thoughtful and caring man, though shy and not the biggest social butterfly, deeply loved her but often struggled with expressing that love in the ways she needed. She (26F), a woman with a strong and fiery spirit, was a fierce defender of those she held close and poured everything she had into the relationship, but still carried emotional scars from her past that made trust and security vital to the relationship. Together, they built a life together full of quiet joy and shared countless moments of deep connection, but beneath the surface, the unspoken tension between them caused cracks to form.

The dynamic between them had stayed the same for most of their relationship. He had a tendency to withdraw, to take a passive role when she needed him to be anything but passive. She needed him to be active and engaged for her to believe she could trust him to hold her heart. She felt like she was pouring from an empty cup, making sacrifices and adjustments that often felt unreciprocated or unnoticed. Three challenging yet wonderful years into their relationship, he turned to private indulgences, habits he hid from her to cope with his own insecurities. He was wasting money on clicks of betrayal when he could have invested that into her or their relationship. But he had uncertainty about himself for his whole life, and a woman who would do anything for him was just too good to be true. He convinced himself it would all end, she would see the light, she would choose to let her free spirit be as it is without him due to his failures. She loved him unconditionally and never gave any sign her feelings for him were fleeting. If anything it was the opposite, as she was dependent on him in ways that made both of them uncomfortable at times. A year later, in an act of service for him and their home, she unknowingly discovered his unruly habits. It was a wound that cut deep and shook the foundation of their relationship. For him, it was never about a lack of love or care for her, rather his own unaddressed shortcomings that had followed him into adulthood. But for her it symbolized a profound disconnection, a betrayal of everything they had built together, and would ever have built together.

Despite the growing distance between the two of them, they loved each other deeply and with their whole hearts. She still yearned for him to take the lead and become the partner she had always dreamed of: committed, confident, and attuned to her needs emotionally, sexually, and socially. He wanted more than anything else in the world to be that man for her, but his past wrongs and the compounding guilt of his betrayal left him feeling like he was always falling short. Even on a perfect day, he still wasn’t good enough for her because of what he had done to her. They tried to mend the cracks in their own way, she finding herself in a panic attack and crying herself to sleep more nights than she ever wanted, and him frozen in time by his own guilt, unable to do what she needed most in the moment. Every waking moment for her was that of agony, wondering what she did wrong in a past life to deserve such horrible circumstances when all she gave was love. That agony was killing him. No matter how many times he could say he was sorry, that he’s changed, it didn’t matter how many work lunches, coffee deliveries, or date nights. He was a monster in her eyes for what he did to her and what she never knew he was capable of. The weight of their unspoken struggles and unmet expectations proved too much for her.

Eventually, she broke. She told him she could no longer live her life in a state of constant pain and panic. That their future they had held onto for all those years as something to distance themselves from his actions was now over. It was a decision she didn’t take lightly, initially saying she just needed space and time to heal away from him, one she knew was necessary for her own growth to finally be able to move on from his betrayal. For him, it was a devastating blow. He replayed every moment of their relationship on loop in his head for the next several days. He looked back at all the ways he could have been a better partner, done more for her, and loved her in the way she always deserved to be loved. Unfortunately for him, he realized too late that he hadn’t fully understood how much she needed him to step up despite her words telling him to. He was unable to reassure her that their love was a lifelong partnership she could trust and commit to unwaveringly.

The breakup was messy and a storm of emotions. Pain, grief, longing, love. After a couple of months navigating the unfamiliar versions of themselves that existed now, they decided to remain in each other’s lives as friends, at least for the time being, while they quietly reminisced through their shared belongings and remnants of their connection. But the proximity only deepened the hurt for him. Seeing her every day, knowing she was beginning to explore new avenues for her own happiness, whether through self-discovery or other connections, felt like salt in the wound. He still wanted to be close to her though, because after everything they have been through she was still his best friend to him. For him, he holds the last burning ember of what they once felt was their love as it singes his hand to the bone. He looked to her to see her damaged hands like his were, but there wasn't but a scratch. He sat in quiet misery, seeing her move on in ways that felt at odds with the woman he still loved so deeply. There was some small part of his heart that was still holding on to hope for them to return to the love they once had, and that hope was what cut him deep inside each and every day. He took action to grow himself and be the best version of himself that he could be, while that tiny spark of hope that just wouldn’t die ripped away at his insides.

For her, the decision to end things was born out of pain and self-preservation, not malice. She cared for him, still missed him in quiet moments she tries not to share with him now, and grappled with her own complex emotions and building walls to protect herself from him again. She knew she couldn’t continue the relationship as it was for her own sake. In her mind, moving forward without him was the only path to start her healing. He, instead found himself wrestling with the echoes of their relationship, the moments that haunted him, and the deep yearning to hold onto the one thing that was slipping further out of his reach. The love they shared wasn’t gone, it was merely transformed. Transformed into something unrecognizable, leaving them both to navigate the uncharted territory of rebuilding their lives without each other. Neither of them wanted this, but they told each other it’s what had to be done for them both to be the best versions of themselves, whether they believed it or not. The love that they shared with each other was sacred. The bond they had was ironclad. But even the strongest of those who love, aren’t immune to a shattering of trust.

In the end, they both carried the weight of their lost love in their own ways. For him, every day was a battle between clutching the burning embers of what once was and trying to forge something new from the ashes. For her, it was a quiet, painful step to move forward, even if that meant leaving behind the person she thought would be her forever. Their lives began to drift away, slowly but surely. He focused on improving himself, not just to prove his worth internally, but to honor the love they shared by becoming the man he always wished he could be for her. She too, sought healing in her own way, learning to trust herself again and to rebuild the pieces of her heart that felt broken beyond repair. Maybe they would cross paths again one day, as different versions of themselves. Maybe they would keep in touch until they found another. Maybe they would both look back at their time together, not with regret, but with gratitude for the love, lessons, and memories that shaped them. But for now, their journey together had reached its tragically cold end, not in hatred, but in the painful reminder that sometimes, even the deepest love cannot withstand the weight of unhealed wounds. Even the brightest fires burn out, leaving only a lingering warmth in the heart. A warmth that, while no longer shared, can still light the way forward, and serve as a gentle reminder of the love we once felt. But even without that warmth, though lingering inside him it may, he could never forget what her love felt like.",1,1734655755.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Hello! I know this is a long shot and I am not expecting much but there’s no hurt in trying. My mom is sick with stage 3 breast cancer. It has been a hard journey to navigate for my mom, younger sister and I. I currently am paying my own way through nursing school and have a job at the local coffee shop but as most of you can guess, things are still severely tight when it comes to finances for myself. 

This past week my mom became ill with pneumonia which has put her in the hospital under 24 hour care as her immune system can not fight off this infection on its own as a result of her chemotherapy. I am not sure when or if she will get through this and that is a thought that is too heartbreaking and imaginable to digest at this time. 

While my mom is in the hospital I am taking care of my younger sister full time which comes with financial responsibilities. From groceries to every day living expenses I am having a hard time being able to provide in the way she needs and deserves. 

I know that it is the Holiday season and everyone is watching their spending but I thought I would humbly ask if anyone has any extra money they are able to donate to be put towards the welfare of my sister and I (I am mainly concerned about my sister) I would be so greatly appreciative. This is not fun to go online and ask strangers for money however my sister has been the one and only reason I am able to put my pride aside and reach out for help. 

 As I said, I am not getting my hopes up or expecting much to come from this post but if anyone see this that is in a position to help out, please feel free to message me privately or comment and I can reach out to you. 

I hope everyone has a safe, happy and healthy holiday and god bless you all 🤍",1,1734655553.0,AskForHelp,0,0.66,False

Should we offer food? If so, I am thinking prepackaged food like Perfect Bar protein bars, Kind Bars, and maybe some local pastries but nothing hot as I do not want to slow the line down. I am open to any food suggestions that are grab and go that customers love. Anything else in general that I should stay away from or offer? What is your favorite or least thing about working in a drive-thru? ",1,1734655547.0,barista,0,0.67,False
