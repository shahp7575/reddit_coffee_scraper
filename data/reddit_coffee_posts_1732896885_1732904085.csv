1h2rny8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aurangabad/comments/1h2rny8/2024_has_been_a_painfully_beautiful_year/,2024 has been a painfully beautiful year!,"All right, let’s do this one last time.

My name is Orge/Penguin, depending on where you saw me first.

And for the past 3 years, I’ve been on Reddit.

I’m pretty sure you know the rest.



(Coffee treat from me if you get the reference, no cheating.)



I’ve been seeing “last week of November” pic collages on my friends’ Insta stories. Or was that just one person spamming... I don’t remember.

Buuuut... that inspired me to do a little check-in with Reddit.

If you know me, It’s very in-character.



Here goes, since the beginning of 2024, I:

* Made a short film.
* I almost made another short film.
* I got saw my crush getting married (on socials) and it actually didn’t hurt much, I was and am happy for her. (Is that what being an individual with a healthy sense of self and emotional tolerance feels like?! Damn!)
* Almost started a student protest... several times.
* I went from being a people pleaser to having healthy friends whom I never have to perform for and I can be myself in front of. (Oh hi, you know who you are... you absolute cutie <3)
* I got rejected a total of 3 times (with 3 different girls this time, not 1, unlike last year lol). But it didn’t turn me into a sad boi. I’m still hopeful for love.
* I wrote more songs on guitar than I learned from other artists.
* I was part of a band, we disbanded.
* I almost formed another band. (looking for a drummer btw)
* I travelled A LOT! Thanks to u/DarkDork11 best travel buddy 10/10, highly recommended. Except for that one time he left me to fend for myself in Mumbai ):/
* I will be in a different state for most of December. Lot of out-of-comfort-zone-core™ but no Dorky this time :( I’ll being souvenirs, dude.
* I became a part of 3 different large social groups in the beginning of the year but now I’m part of none.
* I sang in a recording studio for the first time.
* I performed music in 2 cafes and at the mall.
* I got a tattoo! (No, I’m just checking if you’re still reading. Comment below).
* I went from being the loner guy to somehow people thinking I have rizz. (post for another time?)
* I used Photoshop, Premiere and After Effects for the first time. (Holy trinity?)
* I saw 3 Spanish movies (see a pattern emerging?)
* I hated 3D modelling in Maya but now I love it!
* Actually stuck with a career choice for more than 6 months this time. {someone pls hire me >:v)}
* I grew my hair out till I could tie it up. I cut my hair till I couldn’t. I grew my beard till I am looking 30 years older. I don’t plan to cut it.
* I lost a ton of weight, then gained it all back, then lost it again, then gained it all back... (25’ will be my year, I swear!)
* I managed to get two people into a relationship. They thanked me for it with gifts.



And there’s so much more! But I’ll end with this;



My mental health was terrible throughout this year, I’m barely making it out. Which is strange cause looking back, this year has been one that had the most new and exciting things happen. It made me the most happy and at the same time, it had the most things that defeated me and saw me crying at 3am.



But I guess...That’s life, huh?



Cue that Sinatra song.



End Credits...

1h2rmyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h2rmyr/gf_33f_makes_me_34m_feel_less_than_in_our/,Gf (33F) makes me (34M) feel less than in our relationship. How do I address this?,"I (34M) have been dating my girlfriend (33F) for a little over two years now. She is a doctor, and I am an Account Executive in tech sales.

We moved in together pretty early on, when we were still deep in the “infatuation” phase, at about 6-months into our relationship.

Since moving in, we’ve naturally seen and learned more about each other than was previously revealed when staying at each other’s apartments for a night or two at a time.

Where I find issue is how she treats me and my ideas:

Very shortly after moving in together she explained to me that after seeing me work, she was disappointed that I wasn’t in a higher performing or more prestigious role. She went on to explain that she had hoped to be with a man who could afford to take her on trips, pay for her expensive tastes (paraphrasing), and support her financially. I’m doing fine financially. I’ve paid off my student loans, don’t have credit card debt, and have had a decent retirement and savings plan for ages (well before we got together). However, I am by no means in a position to pay for an all expenses trip to a resort or things like that; and I explained that while I would like to be able to provide for her, it wasn’t in the cards at the moment. I also expressed to her how this made me feel like I wasn’t enough for her. She assured me this wasn’t the case, and that she believed I could “get there”

We seemed to move past this, but other issues started to come up:

I live across the country from my family, and try to speak with them at least once a day. This is an issue for her, and has lead to her calling me “co dependent”; 
She has also made my family feel unwelcome when they came to visit (by not greeting them in the morning, ignoring them, not engaging in activities or conversation with them) to the point that my family wanted to stay at a hotel;
She has, in private, insulted their intelligence and the intelligence and class of my friend group;

She has looked over my shoulder while writing emails, corrected my grammar and told me that “no girl would be with me, if they knew I spelled like that”;
Beyond this, she criticizes how I do my job and how I interact with my coworkers / boss;
After overhearing part of one conversation with my boss, she told me that things at work are going poorly because of me and how I approach things; 

I was worried for my job safety at one point, and she went off on me saying how I should have been prepared to leave ages ago and that I do nothing to improve my situation (despite working with a career counsellor, applying and having multiple interviews with different companies, etc);
She has given me a hard time for saving vacation time to visit my family at Christmas (I have 3weeks, and she has 4weeks) and is upset that I am unable to vacation as long as she would like.

Constantly tells me what I’m doing is “low priority” (ie: if I’m cutting the grass, and she wants to do something else);

I’m a pleaser, and tend to buy treats or coffees for her (which she has asked me not to do, so I’ve stopped);

She has been going through difficulty at work, so took a solo vacation to get her mind off things. While she was gone, I tried to make the house perfect for her so she would be relaxed and in a good place when she returned home. I cleaned her bathroom, re-caulked her bathroom sink, did her laundry, cleaned the floors of the house, took pictures of items we were planning to sell online (and put off for a literal year), I cooked her favourite meal and picked her up from the airport with fresh pressed ginger juice (because she didn’t want a sweet treat, as mentioned above);

It’s been 4 days since she returned, and despite everything I’ve done to make things nice for her, she went off on me for not “driving conversations about our future” enough… despite everything I’ve done to make her return seamless and pleasant, I feel like she’s still searching for the things I do wrong. Rather than appreciating all the good I’ve done, she’s searching for the gaps.

Granted, I am far from perfect. I realize I am very close with my family, and this isn’t for everybody. I realize that I stayed at my job longer than I should have after noticing red flags. But I am trying to improve myself and my situation— it’s just that my approach is different than hers. Sometimes it’s less effective, sometimes more effective than her methods; but it seems like, unless I do things her way, she’s going to call me out and give me a hard time.

As I’m typing all of this out, I think I’ve identified that I’m not ambitious enough for her, but it also makes me realize that I’m being treated pretty poorly, and curious if SHE’S enough for ME… Maybe we’re just incompatible. It’s not wrong for her to want her man to be high performing and take care of her financially; and I don’t think it’s wrong for me to want a partner who treats me with respect.

How do I address this?

If you have gone through something similar with a partner who is at a different stage of their career, how did you overcome the delta? 

TL;DR
I try to be supportive to my girlfriend, who is not supportive to me;
Likely to do with the difference in how we approach work/family/life; where she has done things a very specific way to get where she is, and views other ways as wasting time and energy.
Unsure if there is a future given our apparent incompatibility around how we view and treat one another.",3,1732903191.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Sometimes decisions are just taken out of your hands 😕 and the lessons I've learned. ,"A few more bits have left my house today and I'm sad and annoyed with myself in equal measures. 

I'm trying really hard to be a more 'mindful' shopper especially where clothes are concerned. 

Today I wore a top that I'd bought because I was looking for a nice cable knit cream jumper. It would go with lots that I already had. It ticked lots of the boxes that I needed it to..... Except one! I knew when I bought it that it wasn't quite as long as I would have liked but I bought it anyway. As soon as I put it on today I realised it wasn't quite as perfect as I'd hoped but hey, I can compromise. I love it in every other way and if I have to pull it down every so often, so be it. It's not like it was going to show bare flesh underneath as I had a tank on under it. It's a jumper, right? All was going well (ish) until my dear other half took a look and simply said 'that jumper's too short'. Yes, yes it is and going into denial about it isn't going to make it longer. If anything, I'll probably shrink it in the wash! So as soon as we got home, it went into the donate pile, along with the grey version (unworn obviously) 

LESSON NUMBER ONE TODAY: Make sure future purchases tick the most important boxes. 

While we were out, we sat and had coffee. ""Are your eyes OK? They look really sore"" No, I'm just wearing a new colour eyeliner where I'm clearly not seeing the same thing in the mirror as he's seeing in real life. He was right - I looked like I'd got conjunctivitis. I'm not even going to try to repurpose it. It got thrown out as soon as we got home! 

LESSON NUMBER TWO TODAY: Stop buying new makeup. You have enough and that's why you're in the makeup rehab sub 😂

Then this afternoon, I was putting some things away and found a couple of pairs of unworn knee length boots. I struggle finding them to fit so I buy them when I see them. Except because I've not worn them, they've perished in areas that would be obvious if I put them on. So I've had to throw them away. I'm so upset with myself but it's another of those life lessons. 

LESSON NUMBER THREE TODAY: Stop buying backups. When something needs replacing, you'll find another and get use out of it.

1. **Eco-friendly options** \- Studies show over 60% of consumers prefer restaurants that use sustainable packaging (NielsenIQ Sustainability Report, 2023). Compostable containers and recycled materials made of kraft paper can align your restaurant with the eco-conscious crowd.

2. **Better branding** \- We know that take-out packaging is a moving ad for your restaurant! Custom designs, branded stickers, or even a hashtag for social sharing can turn regular bags into marketing tools. A small café, for example, could add a branded sleeve or sticker to their coffee cups

3. **Functional design** \- Nobody likes soggy food. Invest in packaging that’s leak-proof and heat-retentive while looking great! The right packaging will keep your food fresh and your brand looking professional.

We love the idea that your packaging is more than a container—it’s part of your restaurant’s story. What trends or best practices have you tried, or has been a hit with your customers?

I recently bought a second-hand chrome Vertuo machine, which is supposed to be less than a year old. Unfortunately, it’s been delivering **super watered-down coffee** ever since I got it. 😩

# What I’ve Tried:

1. **Contacted Customer Service**: They were helpful and walked me through a reboot and other troubleshooting steps. Sadly, no luck – it’s still the same.
2. **Outcome from Customer Service**: They informed me that because I bought the machine second-hand, they can’t provide further support. So, I’m on my own here.

# Additional Context:

* I’ve only used **Starbucks pods** with this machine. Could this be the issue?
* I’ve heard that the machine reads barcodes on the pods, so I’m wondering if the Starbucks ones could somehow be causing the problem?

1. Could it actually be the pods, or is this just a coincidence?
2. Is there any DIY fix for Vertuos to improve brewing performance?
3. Any other suggestions for troubleshooting, given the second-hand situation?

","If you're struggling with an ant infestation but want to avoid toxic chemicals, [**natural repellents for ants**](https://ampmexterminator.com/ant-pest-control-seattle-wa/) might be the perfect solution. Ants can quickly take over your kitchen, pantry, or any area in your home where food and water are accessible. Fortunately, there are numerous natural repellents available to keep ants at bay without resorting to harmful pesticides.

Explore various natural remedies and repellents that can help you manage and eliminate ants. These solutions are not only safe for your family and pets but also environmentally friendly. From common kitchen ingredients to essential oils, natural repellents for ants offer an effective way to deal with these persistent pests.

# Understanding Why Ants Invade Your Home

Before we dive into the natural repellents for ants, it's helpful to understand why ants invade homes in the first place. Ants are social insects, and they typically establish trails in search of food, water, and shelter. Once they find a reliable food source, they leave a scent trail for others to follow, leading to an infestation. Some of the most common types of ants that invade homes include:

* **Sugar ants**: These ants are attracted to sugary foods like sweets, fruit, and syrup.
* **Carpenter ants**: These larger ants nest in wood, causing potential structural damage.
* **Fire ants**: Known for their aggressive stings, fire ants can be dangerous to humans and animals.
* **Odorous house ants**: These ants are drawn to moisture and can often be found in kitchens and bathrooms.

In many cases, ants will find their way into your home due to access points, food, and moisture. Whether you're dealing with a few ants or a more serious infestation, natural repellents for ants can help address the problem effectively and without harsh chemicals.

# Benefits of Using Natural Repellents for Ants

Natural repellents for ants offer several advantages over chemical solutions:

1. **Eco-Friendly**: Many natural remedies are environmentally friendly and do not harm beneficial insects or the environment.
2. **Non-Toxic**: Natural repellents are safe for children, pets, and adults, unlike some commercial pesticides, which can pose health risks.
3. **Cost-Effective**: You can create many natural ant repellents with ingredients you likely already have at home.
4. **Preventative**: Many natural repellents can be used not only to eliminate existing ants but also to prevent future infestations.
5. **No Harsh Chemicals**: Natural repellents avoid the use of synthetic chemicals, which can have negative long-term health effects.

# Effective Natural Repellents for Ants

Now that we’ve covered the benefits, let’s explore some of the most popular and effective **natural repellents for ants**.

**1. Vinegar and Water Solution**

Vinegar is one of the most widely used natural repellents for ants. The acetic acid in vinegar disrupts ants' scent trails, which they rely on to navigate. By spraying vinegar and water on ant trails and around entry points, you can quickly drive them away.

**How to use it**:

* Mix equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle.
* Spray it directly onto the ants, along their trails, and at any entry points.
* Wipe down surfaces where ants have been active to remove their scent trails.

The strong smell of vinegar also helps to repel ants, and it can be used safely around your home.

**2. Cinnamon**

Cinnamon is another great natural repellent for ants. Ants dislike the strong scent of cinnamon, and it can disrupt their scent trails, leading them to abandon the area. Additionally, cinnamon has a mild, pleasant smell for humans.

**How to use it**:

* Sprinkle ground cinnamon around areas where ants are entering or along ant trails.
* Alternatively, create a cinnamon spray by adding a few drops of cinnamon essential oil to water and spraying it around entry points.

Cinnamon works well as a deterrent, and it’s safe to use in kitchens and other common areas.

**3. Essential Oils**

Essential oils are a powerful and natural way to repel ants. Many essential oils, such as peppermint, tea tree, eucalyptus, and clove, have strong scents that ants find unpleasant. These oils disrupt ants' communication and can prevent them from entering your home.

**How to use it**:

* Mix 10–15 drops of essential oil with water in a spray bottle.
* Shake the bottle and spray the solution onto ant trails, at entry points, and around your home.
* You can also place cotton balls soaked in essential oils near windowsills and doorways.

Peppermint oil is particularly effective at repelling ants and is often used in DIY ant repellent recipes.

**4. Diatomaceous Earth (Food Grade)**

Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a fine powder made from the fossilized remains of aquatic organisms. It works by physically damaging the exoskeletons of ants, causing them to dehydrate and die. DE is a natural, non-toxic solution that can be used safely around your home.

**How to use it**:

* Sprinkle food-grade diatomaceous earth along ant trails, around entry points, and in areas where ants are nesting.
* Leave the powder for 24–48 hours and then vacuum it up.

DE is effective for both eliminating ants and preventing them from returning, but it should not be inhaled in large quantities, so handle it with care.

**5. Lemon Juice**

Lemon juice is another simple yet effective natural repellent for ants. The acidity of lemon juice disrupts ants' pheromone trails, preventing them from finding their way to food sources. The strong smell of lemons also helps to repel ants.

**How to use it**:

* Squeeze fresh lemon juice into a spray bottle and mix it with water.
* Spray the solution along ant trails, at entry points, and in areas where ants are active.
* You can also place lemon peels near areas where ants are entering your home.

Lemon juice is particularly useful in kitchens and bathrooms, where ants are often attracted to food and moisture.

**6. Talcum Powder or Baby Powder**

Talcum powder is an effective natural repellent for ants. The fine powder disrupts ants' ability to follow scent trails and prevents them from finding their way to food sources. It works similarly to diatomaceous earth but is safer to use in high-traffic areas.

**How to use it**:

* Sprinkle talcum powder or baby powder around doorways, windowsills, and baseboards.
* You can also sprinkle it along ant trails to prevent them from moving further into your home.

Talcum powder is non-toxic and safe for homes with children and pets, but it should be used in moderation to avoid dust buildup.

**7. Cucumber**

Cucumbers, especially bitter ones, are a natural deterrent for ants. The scent and taste of cucumber are unpleasant to ants, and they will avoid areas where cucumber peels or slices are placed.

**How to use it**:

* Place slices or peels of cucumber around ant entry points or areas where ants are active.
* Replace the cucumber every few days to maintain its effectiveness.

Cucumber is a completely natural solution that can help repel ants in a non-toxic way.

**8. Cloves and Bay Leaves**

Cloves and bay leaves are another natural solution for keeping ants out of your home. Both have strong scents that ants dislike and can be used to prevent them from entering your home or kitchen.

**How to use it**:

* Place whole cloves or bay leaves in areas where ants are entering or in your kitchen cabinets.
* You can also crush the cloves to release more scent.

These ingredients can be left in place for long periods, making them an easy and low-maintenance solution.

**9. Coffee Grounds**

Used coffee grounds are a natural repellent for ants. The strong odor of coffee can overwhelm ants' sense of smell, and they tend to avoid areas where coffee grounds are present.

**How to use it**:

* Scatter used coffee grounds near entry points, along ant trails, or in areas where ants are nesting.
* You can also place the grounds in small containers or sachets and place them around your home.

Coffee grounds are a great way to recycle used coffee while also dealing with an ant problem.

**10. Baking Soda and Sugar**

Baking soda and sugar are commonly used together as a natural bait to eliminate ants. While sugar attracts ants, the baking soda is toxic to them. When ants consume the mixture, it reacts with their digestive system and causes them to die.

**How to use it**:

* Mix equal parts of powdered sugar and baking soda in a small dish or container.
* Place it near ant trails or where you’ve seen ants foraging.
* The ants will carry the mixture back to the nest, and the bait will eventually eliminate the colony.

This remedy is effective but may take some time to work, as it relies on the ants carrying the mixture back to their colony.

# Future Ant Infestations

While **natural repellents for ants** are effective, prevention is the key to keeping your home free of ants in the future. Here are some tips to help prevent ants from entering your home:

* **Seal entry points**: Ants can enter through tiny cracks in windows, doors, and foundations. Seal these openings to prevent them from getting inside.
* **Remove food sources**: Ants are attracted to food, so keep your kitchen clean, store food in airtight containers, and clean up spills and crumbs immediately.
* **Fix leaks**: Ants are also drawn to moisture. Repair any leaks in pipes, faucets, or appliances to keep ants from seeking water inside your home.
* **Regularly clean and vacuum**: Keeping your home free of food particles and dirt will make it less attractive to ants.

Natural repellents for ants are an effective and eco-friendly way to deal with an ant problem. Whether you're using vinegar, cinnamon, essential oils, or diatomaceous earth, there are numerous natural solutions that can help you keep ants at bay without relying on toxic chemicals. By incorporating these remedies into your routine and taking preventative measures, you can keep your home ant-free in a safe, sustainable way.

Remember, consistency is key when using natural repellents. Reapply your chosen solution as necessary and combine it with good cleaning habits to prevent future infestations. With these natural repellents, you'll be well on your way to a pest-free home.",1,1732902384.0,u_Danielhunts,0,1.0,False

I didn't know the games would end. I thought they would keep getting extended. 



I am so disappointed that I lost after spending a month on the game when I had enough water to finish. The only reason I waited was because I thought things would be cheaper on Black Friday and I wanted Farmland merge points and the merge would start again soon.



.But what is the point? Things are even more expensive today than they were yesterday. I only have 2 more months left on farmland a​nd there is no way I can finish in that amount of time if the game isnt extended. And my personal life sucks because there was a small electrical fire at the house last night, but no one wants to disconnect the appliance that is randomly sparking next to the gas line because no one is an electrician and that somehow makes them unqualified to unplug an appliance. No real electricians will come out because of the holiday. I'm most dissappinted that a gas explosion didnt take me out of this mess in my sleep.

1h2rapq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/1h2rapq/in_defense_of_barney_stinson/,In Defense of Barney Stinson,"Hey, everyone, it’s your boy u/vedderer with another “In defense of…” post. If you haven’t seen the first one, *In Defense of Ted Mosby,* you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/dnkpbq/in_defense_of_ted_mosby/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I’m back now with another one for Barney. This one is a little trickier, though, and I’ll start with two caveats.

**First, some of Barney’s actions are indefensible.** He sold a woman. He impersonated a doctor and a lawyer. He lied to more people than I can count. He broke The Bro Code. The list goes on. So, despite the title, the purpose of this post is not to defend Barney. I don’t think it’s possible. Instead, the goal is to make the most charitable interpretation of his character and actions. And to explain how and why he became who he is. It is not an excuse for his behavior, because his behavior is inexcusable.

**Second, this post assumes that Ted is a reliable narrator.** Yeah, I know he’s not. But we can have no discussion without this assumption. It’s like how scientists must assume consistency in the causes that operate in the natural world. That is, physicists assume that the laws of physics yesterday were the same as they are today and will be tomorrow. There would be no logical point in conducting a physics experiment without this assumption. Ok, with that out of the way…

**The story of Barney Stinson, as we know him throughout most of the show, begins with Shannon.** Shannon broke Barney. Before she left him for Greg, Barney was depicted as kind, giving, and respectful to everyone he met (both men and women). He worked at a coffee shop, was going to help the Nicaraguans, and was in a committed relationship. This is shown in the back-and-forth that he had with Greg in *Game Night*:

Greg: “Dude, that your g-friend? All right, high five!”

Barney: “Sorry, I only give high twos.”

Greg: “Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that.”

Barney: “Listen to you. *That*? You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings. And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married. You can read about it in my zine.”

Greg: “Hey, haircut, right here. Open up your knowledge basket, 'cause here it comes. Forget that touchy-feely crap. You get money, you get laid. End of discussion.”

Barney: “I feel sorry for you, man.”

***Game Night*** **is Barney’s villain origin story.** When Shannon left Barney for Greg, he lost his faith in love. He saw that Shannon chose Greg over him, so he began to believe that Greg might be right. That you “get money, you get laid.” So, he became Greg. Barney said to Shannon, “When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this (gestures to self).”

Barney still had good in him, though. In *Game Night,* Barney is visibly thankful for how ""awesomely awesome"" his life is right before Marshall declares that he ""won game night."" But, in the last scene of the episode, he’s briefly seen sitting alone at the bar with an unmistakably sad look on his face (21:20 on my Hulu account) before deliberately putting on a smile and approaching a girl at the bar. He’s kinda like Darth Vader. Just like Luke saw that there was still good in Vader, a few women in the show saw that there was still good in Barney. Nora and Robin, specifically.

**More so than a villain, Barney is Ted’s foil.** The Cambridge Dictionary defines a foil as “something or someone that makes another’s good or bad qualities more noticeable.” I think this is true in a few ways.

Ted is a romantic guy who admirably maintains his faith in love despite setbacks. Of course, there are moments in the show when it wavers and when he loses it. One example of it wavering is in *Time Travelers.* After asking her if their relationship is doomed completely, Coat-check Girl (really Ted’s imagination) says, “You’ve been dating for a long time, Ted. Has it ever gone any other way?” An example of him losing it is in *No Tomorrow.* The day after the party (i.e., actual tomorrow), Marshall says to him: “You’re turning into Barney. We don’t need another Barney.” Ultimately, these highlight how difficult it is to keep faith in love.

In contrast, Barney lost his faith in love after Shannon broke him. Of course, there are times when he allows himself to regain hope. Most notably with Nora and Robin. Speaking of Robin…

**Robin choosing Barney over Ted is similar to Shannon choosing Greg over Barney.** Shannon chose a womanizer in a suit (Greg) over a nice guy (Barney). Later, Robin chose a womanizer in a suit (Barney) over a nice guy (Ted). What’s the saying? “You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”

You know that speech that Ted was going to give to Stella after she left him for Tony? “You picked the wrong guy. You made a really, really, really bad choice. What were you thinking? That guy? Are you kidding me? Have you learned nothing in the last eight years? You're just gonna regret this. You know that, right? You are going to regret this, and now there is nothing you can do about it because it's too late. All you can do now is go up there and start your crappy, disappointing life that will never be nearly as happy as the one you could have had with me. Good-bye.” That had to have been what Ted was thinking when he found out Barney and Robin were engaged. The difference is that he was wrong about Stella and Tony, but would have been right about Robin and Barney.

Ted recalls what it was like when he found out: “Kids, at that point in my life I’d been hurt quite a few times already. But when I saw that text message and found out Robin was engaged it was like (shows scenes of excruciating pain) times a million.” The similarity of the two situations provides a contrast that highlights Ted’s faith in love. It broke Barney, but Ted’s faith endured. Something similar happened in *The Dark Knight.* When Rachel died, it turned Harvey into Two-Face, but Bruce stayed good.

**Do nice guys (like Ted) finish second to womanizers in suits (Barney and Greg)?** For a time. Shannon left Barney (nice guy) for Greg (womanizer). Later, Robin married Barney (womanizer) and not Ted (nice guy). It’s ironic… we’re all disgusted by Barney’s actions toward women, but those actions were based on a woman’s (i.e., Shannon’s) preferences.

But, fear not all you nice guys on Team Tedward who never turned into Greg! There are plenty of points to take solace in. Greg and Shannon didn’t last. Neither did Robin and Barney. In fact, Robin all but admits that she made a mistake in not choosing Ted in her dialogue with Lily in *The Last Forever Part 1*: “Here's what the gang is: the gang is a married couple who I never see anymore, about to have their third kid; it's my ex-husband, hitting on slutty cops right in front of me; and it's the guy I probably should have ended up with with the beautiful mother of his child.”

And, there are two additional bonuses for Team Tedward regarding Tracy. First, Tracy saw through and rejected Barney. When Barney asked for Tracy’s number, she said, “Listen, I appreciate that you feel like you need my number. Maybe it’s because you’re really sad about something and this is your way of feeling better about yourself. But… since I have a boyfriend, and I’m pretty sure I heard you call me a target earlier over there, I’m gonna go ahead and not give you my number.” Second, at least one of Ted’s nice guy traits worked with Tracy. He texted her the day after they met.

TL;DR: Many of Barney’s actions are indefensible, and he comes by them honestly. Who doesn’t? His primary narrative function is as Ted’s foil, to highlight Ted’s perseverance and faith in love.",3,1732902295.0,HIMYM,0,1.0,False

I have always had a relatively hard time connecting with my peers and staying in consistent friend groups. 
I tend to have fallen to the back, and been the weird horse girl, or the girl who likes rocks and talks about random shit. So most of the time people telling me to “tell them about myself” was just their way of getting me to go on one of my info dumps and they’d laugh and act intrigued. I later learned I was just to topic of humor and didn’t mind because at least they weren’t aggressively bullying me. (I think) so now as an adult 
It is extremely difficult for me to maintain friendships and relationships. 
I’ve had over a decade of therapy for my trauma and work with my therapist on my social skills and overall agreeability. I’m really bad at not really being myself and masking. I try not to talk too much or be loud or stim publicly. I’m really good about setting boundaries now for social setting and opting out if I know it’ll be a trigger. So I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong :( I thought going back to college would help, but even here people are bizarre and make weird comments about my interest and how I dress sometimes. I try to connect and ask to hang out or get coffee or check out local record shops. Similar interests Yenno ? And I just can’t maintain any connection. I can’t build friendships. Literally no one wants to hang out with me. I have two best friends. And we’ve been friends for almost 10 years. My other bestie almost 4. They’re both thousand of miles away and I figure that’s the only reason I’ve been able to maintain this friendship. 

I’m trying to figure out what I’m doing wrong :( 
Has anyone else struggle to even make friendships and keep them. 
It’s to the point I can’t even feel alone anymore because I’m so used to it. 
I can’t help but think about my 30th or if I get married. Or if someone I love dies. 

I’ll be alone. And the room will be empty. And I can’t help but wonder why I am the way I am and what I am doing wrong :( 
I feel like I’m missing things. I want to celebrate people. And go on adventures. And have meaningful connections in my life. I actually really love people. I care about how they are. So it makes me feel kinda sad :/

I’ve really learned to like myself and my “quirks” it’s devastating learning , one is just really an unlikable person :/

Lure, a marketing intern during that championship season, passed away peacefully at the age of 101. His death marked not only the end of an era but also a moment of reflection for a fanbase still waiting for its next taste of glory.

**The Ceremony**

Edward George Halas McCaskey, Jr., great-great-great-grandson of George ""Papa Bear"" Halas and current chairman of the Chicago Beats (the Bears’ rebranded esports franchise, launched after the NFL’s streaming boom of the 2040s), presided over the memorial. ""Today, we honor a man who embodied the spirit of the 1985 Chicago Bears,” McCaskey declared before a crowd of tearful fans. “Though he only fetched coffee and once misspelled 'Ditka' in a press release, Fishing Lure was an integral part of our Super Bowl journey.”

Fans clutching commemorative coins bearing Lure’s likeness paid their respects. The coins, priced at $1,100 (a modest $250 in 2024 dollars), sold out within minutes of their release. Each was inscribed with Lure’s oft-quoted mantra: “I was there. Kind of.”

Adding to the gravity of the occasion, Lure’s Super Bowl ring—originally gifted to him by Walter Payton for ""keeping morale up with donuts""—was displayed at Soldier Field (renamed Soldier Zone following the Metaverse Partnership of 2057). Tickets to view the ring were priced at $150, an amount fans gladly paid to connect with their storied past.

**The Game**

As fate would have it, the memorial coincided with the Bears’ game against the Liverpool Lions, the reigning Super Bowl champions and pride of the NFL’s European expansion. Liverpool entered the game with a record of 23-0, poised to secure a historic undefeated season. Meanwhile, the Bears trudged in at 6-18, clinging to mathematical playoff hopes with the same desperation that fans cling to highlights of William “The Refrigerator” Perry's touchdown run.

Despite the somber atmosphere, the Bears made an admirable effort. Quarterback Blake “Crypto” Fields IV threw two touchdown passes to lead the Bears into a 21-21 tie late in the fourth quarter. But with seconds remaining, Liverpool’s cybernetic kicker (a controversial yet league-approved enhancement) booted a 67-yard field goal to secure a 24-21 victory. As the ball sailed through the uprights, a collective groan swept through the crowd, followed by the stoic refrain: “We’ll get ’em next year.”

**A Legacy of Longing**

The Bears’ loss extended their championship drought to 77 years, a streak only rivaled in infamy by the Detroit Lions’ 144-year title-less saga. But for the fans, the day was less about the game and more about cherishing the memory of a team that, for one glorious season, could do no wrong.

Outside the stadium, located in Wheaton, Illinois since 2031, scalpers peddled vintage ""Super Bowl Shuffle"" NFTs while kids played flag football on the Halas-Haliburton Helipad Plaza. Inside, fans raised $500 beers (inflation-adjusted $50) to toast their enduring loyalty. “It’s not about winning,” said lifelong fan Charlie Ditkason, whose father attended the ’85 Super Bowl. “It’s about tradition. And crying. Mostly crying.”

For a moment, it seemed as if the ghost of 1985 hovered over Soldier Zone. Then the hologram of Mike Ditka, projected onto the Jumbotron, delivered his classic halftime rally cry: “Stop embarrassing me.” The crowd cheered in unison.

**A Hopeful Conclusion**

As night fell on Chicago, fans trudged home with heavy hearts and lighter wallets. While Liverpool celebrated yet another victory, the Bears faithful found solace in their collective hope that the next great team—one that doesn’t need holographic coaches or commemorative coins to remind them of success—might still be on the horizon.

“Next year,” one fan muttered, echoing a phrase passed down through generations like a family heirloom. “If only we had a good quarterback and a coach.”",2,1732902166.0,ChicagoBearsNFL,0,1.0,False

I (28M) have been with my girlfriend Lucy (F23) for 1.5 years. The first 8 months we lived in the same city and lived together for most. Then I had to move, and we have been doing long distance since may this year. She is wonderful. We talk a lot and are very open with each other. And I am sure of her love. Obviously you will say everyone feels that, but I see how she looks at me, how excited she is to spend time with me and the effort she puts in. I do not believe for a second that she would do anything like cheating. But I think we do not agree where is the line of respecting a relationship, the things you should not do while in a relationship. To me it is obvious, but apparently not, which makes me doubt if I am an AH. I need impartial opinions, specially from women here if possible. The situation.

At work she met Ian (M39). They are both freelancers and Ian connected her with a job. Then a couple of weeks ago Ian invited Lucy to watch a movie with his friends and colleagues, as they work in a big TV company and Ian would like to introduce them to her. She told me immediately, and I think it was perfectly fine. They are also in the cinema/tv production world (directors, cameras, etc), so it is normal activity, and knowing people is key. I met Ian and he seemed nice and respectful. He knows I am Lucy’s BF.

Couple days later Lucy invited her friend John to come to the movie with Ian and the group. I also know him, he is a common friend that is super into movies. I am not in town in these dates. Then a couple days ago Lucy told me Ian may not come, he was busy. 

Then 3 days ago I was talking with Lucy and asked if Ian was going in the end, and she said yes. And that he told her that the real reason he did not want to go at first was that he does not like John, who he has met at work, and talked to briefly. He said something along the lines of “I do not feel like spending time with relationships that do not fulfill me”. Lucy told him to come anyways, and that after the movie they could split and not be with John, do their thing. Apparently they will go to dinner at a japanese restaurant. Also, the friends that were going to be introduced were not mentioned anymore. Before this Ian also told Lucy that he was going to talk to her about another work opportunity during that night out

That is the end of facts as I know them, now my evaluation and why I am uncomfortable. 

Ian invited Lucy to meet his friends that are in the same field. But then when she brings John he does not want to come. I think the justification is bs, it is a group activity, the interaction with this particular person is very limited, and all the rest are your close friends

Also, then if Ian is not coming, he is not talking about the work opportunity nor presenting the friends? Was not that the whole point? And also, he ditches HIS OWN FRIENDS? What does he tell his friends? For one person in a whole group he does not like (but does not have a big or personal problem with) he leaves the whole activity with his friends?

Then about splitting with the group. First, about John, does Lucy abandon him alone? Is not that a little rude with a friend that you invited? And they leave together the group, something I think is very much a couples dynamic. Furthermore, if the purpose was to get acquainted with the friends and build rapport, wouldn’t it be more reasonable to have dinner all together? You cannot really get acquainted in a movie. Side note: sushi place sound super high effort and expensive for a chill chat. And if the job proposal has to be done in person, why not a coffee in the middle of the afternoon? Also, what about Ian friends? It is originally a “Ian and friends” activity that Lucy is invited to tag along. But then Ian ditches his original plan to be with his friends to do something with Lucy only?

I find everything weird. To me it looks like Ian wants a date without acknowledging that it is a date. A sneaky date. Starts as a group outing to get to know professional acquaintances in a field that is very much driven by personal relationships and then a job proposal that only needs them two. The friends easily disappear from the equation. When Lucy introduces a friend Ian flips and does not want to come, because it introduces a problem with his plan. He complains in order to get what he wanted: alone time. Also I think that this is a pattern when people in same fields are at differ career stages: attract with “job opportunities “. Also, Ian previous relationships was with a F26 coworker. This is my hypothesis. 

Am I being insecure or unreasonable? I really need to know to see how to deal with this situation. I do not believe Lucy would do anything or even like the guy. But I feel uneasy and that the situation is disrespectful to me. To John and the friend group it looks clearly that there is something between them when they split from the group, I think. Please give me your honest perspective. Lucy is coming soon to my city for many weeks and is extremely eager, as am I, so again, I do not believe there is anything between them.

1h2r5zz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArrowsandBowSnark/comments/1h2r5zz/podcast_recap_everything_you_thought_is_true/,"Podcast recap: everything you thought is true. Between the Dinky sex talk and Assley’s narcissism, brain rot needs reversal..🤮","She goes first, sets the frame for the conversation..

Assley: Match with me, dress like me, make a shake for me every day, wear cologne, shave, mustache fetish, wear shirts that choke Dino and make him uncomfortable, fluff the bed, fill up gas tank, workout, look good and food intent 

Dinky: Sexually aggression from Assley, paint nails, also shave (ewwww), wear bras and clothes he likes; get in his head; mental issues and calm talk; sometimes gets coffee and food, comes home to girl wanting me, doesn’t care about dirty laundry

Ash: That’s why it’s (laundry) passed onto the kids

Why they don’t have many friends: They obsess over a couple, go deep, number one people, one friend people, then feel let down after hanging out a lot, then couple drops them. Enneagram type since Trailer days: 8 and 7, compatible only with couples or people that are 2s who don’t have assertion. They lead, can only have friends who follow. Ash and Dinky: issues with authority, dominating others.

Gifts: Dinky gets fired up in a passive aggressive way about Assley’s retelling of gifts story: he says it’s a little bit different and a little bit worse every time, 6 different years jammed into one story, half what mom has contrived..then she interrupts: candy from Target, grabbed things that didn’t fit my body; thought that counts, but no thought went into it, he check a box; didn’t know any better. 

Dinky says from the kids: Dad you were so dumb, Mom has overemphasis of expectation for stuff; Assley: model I grew up with; need a gift, for the moment, to fill me up. Dinky says she needed dopamine, emotional high from gifts.

Great podcast to kick off those Black Friday deals at the Murky! Sell your soul for Assley’s tchotchkes! ",2,1732901949.0,ArrowsandBowSnark,0,1.0,False

1h2r5q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1h2r5q4/thanksgiving_and_the_aftermath_happy/,Thanksgiving and the aftermath (happy),"While my oldest and I cooked about 90% of the meal yesterday, their husband and mine were right behind us, cleaning, getting the place set up for the guests that were coming later. They(my oldest) and their husband just moved into their home and are still in the process of unpacking. So my husband helped our son in law get things put away, at least out of sight so the house looked nice. They hung pictures and some art our kid had been meaning to get to but hadn't had the time. The place looked great, and really homey after they were done. 

When my son in laws family arrived, he gave them a tour and my husband came into the kitchen to help relieve us a bit. He cleaned as we went and grabbed heavy stuff from the oven for us. He corralled their puppy each time we needed to open the oven as the little stinker kept trying to jump in at the food. Haha. He was really great!

Today, I woke up to my feet killing me and so swollen. I still had sock imprints from yesterday. I was limping through the house cuz it hurt to walk, even my calves are sore. I didn't realize I had been on my feet for nearly 12 hours yesterday. So my husband decided to get up and run our morning errands by himself, something we almost always do together. He came back with my favorite coffee and I sat outside enjoying watching the snow fall and playing my relaxing mobile game. When I came back in, he had set up my foot bath, complete with newly purchased Epsom salt that he didn't tell me he grabbed this morning. He told me to sit for however long I wanted and take it easy today. 

So that's what I'm doing as he has me direct him on where I want our newly framed pictures to be hung. I truly don't know what I did to deserve this man, but good lord am I ever so thankful for him. We've had all the usual ups and downs over our 15 years, but I legitimately don't think I could live without him. It really pays to be married to your best friend.

I hope you all had a great thanksgiving! I have so much to be thankful for and I am just filled with love.",1,1732901930.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

1h2r48j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h2r48j/wibtah_for_opposing_to_this_dinner_between_my/,WIBTAH for opposing to this dinner between my girlfriend and her colleague?,"I need your help to know if I am being unreasonable and insecure/possessive here.

I (28M) have been with my girlfriend Lucy (F23) for 1.5 years. The first 8 months we lived in the same city and lived together for most. Then I had to move, and we have been doing long distance since may this year. She is wonderful. We talk a lot and are very open with each other. And I am sure of her love. Obviously you will say everyone feels that, but I see how she looks at me, how excited she is to spend time with me and the effort she puts in. I do not believe for a second that she would do anything like cheating. But I think we do not agree where is the line of respecting a relationship, the things you should not do while in a relationship. To me it is obvious, but apparently not, which makes me doubt if I am an AH. I need impartial opinions, specially from women here if possible. The situation.

At work she met Ian (M39). They are both freelancers and Ian connected her with a job. Then a couple of weeks ago Ian invited Lucy to watch a movie with his friends and colleagues, as they work in a big TV company and Ian would like to introduce them to her. She told me immediately, and I think it was perfectly fine. They are also in the cinema/tv production world (directors, cameras, etc), so it is normal activity, and knowing people is key. I met Ian and he seemed nice and respectful. He knows I am Lucy’s BF.

Couple days later Lucy invited her friend John to come to the movie with Ian and the group. I also know him, he is a common friend that is super into movies. I am not in town in these dates. Then a couple days ago Lucy told me Ian may not come, he was busy. 

Then 3 days ago I was talking with Lucy and asked if Ian was going in the end, and she said yes. And that he told her that the real reason he did not want to go at first was that he does not like John, who he has met at work, and talked to briefly. He said something along the lines of “I do not feel like spending time with relationships that do not fulfill me”. Lucy told him to come anyways, and that after the movie they could split and not be with John, do their thing. Apparently they will go to dinner at a japanese restaurant. Also, the friends that were going to be introduced were not mentioned anymore. Before this Ian also told Lucy that he was going to talk to her about another work opportunity during that night out

That is the end of facts as I know them, now my evaluation and why I am uncomfortable. 

Ian invited Lucy to meet his friends that are in the same field. But then when she brings John he does not want to come. I think the justification is bs, it is a group activity, the interaction with this particular person is very limited, and all the rest are your close friends

Also, then if Ian is not coming, he is not talking about the work opportunity nor presenting the friends? Was not that the whole point? And also, he ditches HIS OWN FRIENDS? What does he tell his friends? For one person in a whole group he does not like (but does not have a big or personal problem with) he leaves the whole activity with his friends? 

Then about splitting with the group. First, about John, does Lucy abandon him alone? Is not that a little rude with a friend that you invited? And they leave together the group, something I think is very much a couples dynamic. Furthermore, if the purpose was to get acquainted with the friends and build rapport, wouldn’t it be more reasonable to have dinner all together? You cannot really get acquainted in a movie. Side note: sushi place sound super high effort and expensive for a chill chat. And if the job proposal has to be done in person, why not a coffee in the middle of the afternoon? Also, what about Ian friends? It is originally a “Ian and friends” activity that Lucy is invited to tag along. But then Ian ditches his original plan to be with his friends to do something with Lucy only?

I find everything weird. To me it looks like Ian wants a date without acknowledging that it is a date. A sneaky date. Starts as a group outing to get to know professional acquaintances in a field that is very much driven by personal relationships and then a job proposal that only needs them two. The friends easily disappear from the equation. When Lucy introduces a friend Ian flips and does not want to come, because it introduces a problem with his plan. He complains in order to get what he wanted: alone time. Also I think that this is a pattern when people in same fields are at differ career stages: attract with “job opportunities “. Also, Ian previous relationships was with a F26 coworker. This is my hypothesis.  

Am I being insecure or unreasonable? I really need to know to see how to deal with this situation. I do not believe Lucy would do anything or even like the guy. But I feel uneasy and that the situation is disrespectful to me. To John and the friend group it looks clearly that there is something between them when they split from the group, I think. Please give me your honest perspective. Lucy is coming soon to my city for many weeks and is extremely eager, as am I, so again, I do not believe there is anything between them.

My next step was an ""entry level"" electric grinder. I was not able to get the same results as in the YouTube videos with this.

Finally, l decided to bite the bullet, and purchased an Ode 2 when on sale for 20% off. My brewtimes are now consistent with what l see in YouTube videos, my coffee bed after brewing now looks like what l see on YouTube and most importantly, my coffee taste has really improved.

I was skeptical as a newbie when others said that a good coffee grinder is very important. My wallet wishes l would have listened and purchased a high end grinder in the beginning.  I guess the benefit is knowing what coffee tastes like with a lesser grinder.

How do I proceed?,"Boyfriend is 30M, I’m 21F, we’ve been together for a little over a year and a half. Throwaway because although I have a reddit account that isn’t active, better to be safe than sorry.

Some context, boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year and a half. We live together, and while his parents are down the street from us, my family lives across the state. It’s hard to be able to travel there annually for holidays, and last time I was there was Christmas of 2023.

Our argument started the morning of Thanksgiving. We had been sleeping in due to us picking up more shifts at work and had been in bed since 11 AM (I swear this is important.) I have a cat who I feed routinely, I give her wet food in the morning once I wake up and I like to follow her routine. I had gotten up 15 minutes before he did to feed my cat, tidy the house, then came back into the room to find him awake. I asked him if he could like a coffee, boyfriend said yes, I made him one. Once I had brought it back I told him I was going to sit in the living room with my coffee, assuming he was going to get up.

He immediately responded with something in the vein of hoping I could stay in bed with him, although a bit irritatingly. I said I could move my stuff into the room, and once I did he grabbed his things and moved into the other room.

Give a couple hours of him not speaking to me, me being confused because I had moved all my stuff back into the living room for him to immediately move into another room. Once he started getting ready to leave for his family’s house, that is when the argument started. He was upset that I hadn’t stayed in bed with him and I was upset it didn’t even feel like he wanted me to get up and feed my cat in the morning.

Boyfriend said, “You know what? I don’t care where you go or what you do, I’m going to have a great Thanksgiving.” And stormed out of the house, leaving me alone with nowhere to go, considering I don’t have many friends, no family in the state or even neighboring states, and nothing to do. After a few, he texted me, asking me if I could get ready because his mother and daughter were expecting me. I said no, because the only reason he wanted me there was because other people expected me, not because he cared for me to be there. He apologized for “saying that”, telling me “he didn’t mean it.” But the issue is that this is not the first time something like this has happened. He has told me many hurtful things during arguments in the past and it’s always the same thing. What hurt the most this time was that I had no family to go to on a holiday meant to be celebrated with family.

Our relationship is not perfect, it is not sunshine and roses and that’s why I constantly wonder if maybe it’s just time to leave. It gets better for a while then the cycle continues again. I would just like some words of advice, some insight, on how people would feel in this situation. Maybe I’m thinking about blowing this up for nothing?

Before anyone jumps in to say, ""It's not a miracle drug; did you track your food???????????"" - no, I didn't, because if I were the type of person who could track their calories easily, I wouldn't need $300 a month injections! I know I sound like a jerk, and I know tracking works for people; I'm just frustrated because the chief reason I am obese (besides pregnancies/perimenopause) is extreme difficulty sticking with systems like that. I do pay for a tracker, and I did make an attempt to do it multiple times, but I had the same issues remembering to log, eating too much, etc that I do without the injections. 

I already committed to the next 3-month refill, so I'm just going to up the dosage on my own and see if it does anything. If it works, I'm willing to spend the extra $100 a month, but if it doesn't, I'll just run it out and be done. I have a few friends who are taking WeGovy right now, and they are not tracking or doing anything new besides taking their shots, and they are losing. I know they are on higher dosages than me, so I'm hoping that's the explanation, but we'll see.

FWIW, even without the weight loss, I didn't find the injections totally useless. They do help me to get full quicker and curb certain cravings (although they increased others - I went from wanting a lot of salty snacks to wanting a lot of sugary ones). They also, interestingly, helped me drastically cut back on my coffee intake. So if tracking isn't a problem for you, I can absolutely see how these shots would help. But for me, I'm now just wasting my money on my tracker AND the injections rather than simply wasting my money on the tracker alone.

Can anyone relate? Also, I guess as long as I'm here it couldn't hurt to ask: has anyone who struggles with tracking found a system that works for them? I currently have myfitnesspal, but I've used WW and Noom in the past. Nothing sticks. It isn't the trackers; it's me! I recently learned I have ADHD if that means anything (not medicated for that, but I do take Effexor for anxiety).",0,1732901092.0,henrymeds,3,0.5,False

- he lied about fertility. He didn’t tell me until after we were trying to conceive AND married that he was pretty sure he was infertile. He told me that he set aside money for IVF in his youth to cover it. This was lies because I was still obliged to pay for half of the treatments. 
- it has been a dead bedroom for a few years now. First, because he was stressed at work. Then he was depressed over a fight with his family. Then it was because he injured himself. Then it was because he developed a complex about the fear of not being able to get it up. I suggested he go to therapy. Or see a doctor. He didn’t want to because he was embarrassed. To be honest, in the last year, I don’t ever want him to touch me even if he managed to snap himself out of whatever funk he is in. I’m done. I can take care of myself and IMO, I am a saint for having never resorted to cheating. It has been ONE sexual encounter in FOUR years. 
- he tells me how tight funds are and how much pain he is in. I told him that we should give up our pets while they’re still young. Why? food and vet bills and insurance and we cannot even walk them because he’s in pain. We are struggling with groceries and daycare and have cut out any extra curricular activities that cost money due to inflation. I cannot walk them as I have terrible knees myself and they’ve clotheslined me before and run me over and pulled me over. He told me that I was a terrible person for even considering giving up family. 
- I’ve mentioned we struggle a bit with groceries (so we are on a tight budget) YET he cooks the dogs their own piece of chicken the few times we have meat (we usually have stews) so they don’t feel “left out”. Say what? Honestly. Am I on glue? Or does it feel as if he prioritize the dogs over us humans? 
- I agreed to purchasing a fixer-upper house because: 1. his family promised to help (they didn’t); 2. so that in the event of a child, he can afford all expenses by himself (inflation and stagnant wages prevented this)—I was obliged to go back to work earlier than I’d like because bills. YET. My suggestion to give up the pets is unthinkable. 
- I clean, food prep, do dishes, laundry and take care of our child. I barely sleep because our child feeds through the night. He tells me that he doesn’t have a good night’s sleep himself and that he’s working. As if I don’t?
- He tells me that he would help more if I made a list (like, he doesn’t have eyes and didn’t see that he spilled coffee that needs to be wiped up) and if my standards were lower (egg still stuck in fork tines after washing is acceptable)? Apparently, I’m overreacting when I get upset over these TINY things. 
- As mentioned, I clean and do dishes. YET he manages to make a mess almost as soon as I finish. When he *does* help he views it as such a big help to me. BUT the house is still dirty, the dishes still have food stuck to it, the laundry is just thrown in a pile, and our child is put in the bouncer front of the tv. 
- He doesn’t engage in conversation and is chronically online, doom scrolling. 
- If he does engage in conversation, it is about his pain, why he can’t help out, how tired he is, how his family is causing mental distress. 
- He thinks that we don’t spend time because I don’t want to sit on the couch and watch movies. BTW. we always used to watch things he wanted. Because if I wanted to watch something I wanted, he would just be on his phone. 
- he promises to do something and forgets all the time. If I remind him, I’m nagging. If I get pissed off after the fifth time to remind him, I’m unreasonably yelling.

This is honestly not all of my grievances but yeah. I am OVER this and (as it isn’t an abusive relationship) am only hanging on until our child is a bit older.

(Also used u/MandyMod's suggestion of renaming it Durst Manor so as not to alarm the players) Having a 3D space with interior of the walls visible really helped to flesh out the building as a lived-in space. Plus the cardboard was lightweight so really easy to transport.

Supplies Used:

* Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop (if that counts as a supply)
* Cardboard 
* Soda Box
* Acrylic Paint
* Fine tip pen
* Hot Glue
* Mod Podge

Here's How I Did It:

1. First I cut up pieces of cardboard matching the scale of the floors and walls listed in the CoS book with 1 inch = 5 feet. For simplicity, I made each of the walls 15 feet in height.
2. In Adobe Illustrator, I recreated the map to scale using mostly just images I could find on Google. While doing this I made sure to mimic the vibe of each floor from the book (floor 1 and 2 being relatively normal looking, with floor 3 and attic looking progressively disheveled). These were then printed. 
3. While designing in Illustrator, I'd hop over to Photoshop to design a few painting for the house. One example was a portrait of the Durst family which I made by just altering the colors of a renaissance family portrait. 
4. I painted the inside of all cardboard walls and floors black. Then painted the outside of the walls using a pale green. While painting the pale green I used very little paint without water mixed into it so it would be very tacky like a weathered facade. 
5. Once the paint dried I used a fine pen to draw thin lines for the boards and nails on the outside of the house. 
6. For the roof tiles I cut open a soda box and painted the inside black. (I chose the inside because it didn't have a print or laminate on it so my paint would stick better.) Once dry I cut them horizontally into long strips about 1"" in height. In these strips I cut a series of vertical lines going up about 1/4"". In the end I had a bunch of long strips that each looked like a row of tiles. These I then layered onto an unusual shaped box and voila! I had a roof. 
7. The Illustrator printouts were then applied to the appropriate floors and walls using Mod Podge (I did the same for the windows and door on the exterior of the house). The trick is to put down a **very thin** layer of Mod Podge onto the cardboard, then stick the printout to it and let it dry, making sure to flatten out any air bubbles. Then add a **thin** layer of Mod Podge on top of the printout to seal the whole thing in. Less is more, adding to much can cause wrinkles and tears. 
8. Last step was to use hot glue to get all the walls and floors sealed together. I chose to keep each floor separate so that it would be easy to go between them during gameplay.
9. BONUS: the basement, I made a simple mockup of the floor’s layout to scale. To save money I went to Staples and printed this out [as a blueprint ](https://www.staples.com/services/printing/engineering-blueprints/)which ended up being about $3 for a giant print. Fun fact- If you use a thin marker to draw a 1""x1"" grid **before** going over the whoe thing with colored pencil, there will be a subtle but noticeable groove in the paper. Really helps make your grid feel like tiling so do that. Next I put the print into the bathtub and soaked it in tea and coffee for about an hour to give it some aging, and also to make the colors bleed together to really make it feel like a found artifact. Once dry I went back over the grid with the same marker just to make the lines a bit more visible. The edges were torched and the levels were separated so there would be some reveal as the players delved deeper.

I’ve watched and read a lot of reviews mostly from the US. I have decided to go for the Gaggia Classic and the Baratza Encore ESP (any opinion is welcome).

However, I am in Belgium and when I look online to buy the Gaggia classic, I find that the « Gaggia Classic Pro e24 » that most reviews talk about doesn’t exist on the official Gaggia website, but only on third party websites such as Whole Latte Love’s. 

The models I was able to find on Bol.com, a website for the Netherlands and Belgium, are :
- Gaggia Classic E24
- Gaggia Classic Evo Pro
- Gaggia Classic Evo Pro (Ltd edition) - which I understand is just a design rework of the Evo Pro
- Gaggia New Classic

And in the screenshot are the 3 « Classic » models that are on the Gaggia website.

Can somebody explain, or direct me to an explanation, of the differences between these models ? And which model the « Gaggia Classic Pro e24 » actually is ? ",4,1732900078.0,gaggiaclassic,3,1.0,False

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about.",1,1732899994.0,enlightenment,0,1.0,False
1h2qefo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1h2qefo/dating_a_girl_that_just_came_out_of_a_6_month/,Dating a girl that just came out of a 6 month relationship,"TLDR: she came out of a 6 month relationship and I don't know how to proceed.


Early November
- Met (30M) this girl (21F) on Threads, I've DMd her on IG and the conversation went pretty well, she's sarcastic and funny just like me, although she has ADHD. We've started texting but on the 2nd day we've started exchanging voice messages instead. In the meantime she's requested to follow me (her profile is public, my profile is private) and a few days later we jumped to whatsapp.
- So, a week going back and forth she shared a lot of her daily life without me asking and she initiated a few times, the conversation was mostly about her and she told me she was dumped by her BF (now ex) about 1 month ago from a 6 month relationship, therefore she was on her own although they ended in good terms.
- During that conversation I've asked her out for a casual coffee and she agreed but then I've suggested dinner because of her working hours (actually she sent me a photo of her shift sheet) and again, she agreed. Please note that she lives about a 3 hour drive away from me, but occasionally I need to go to her hometown because of my job, so I wasn't really aware of decent places to take her out for dinner, so I've checked tripadvisor in advance. However, while we were talking, something came up about the fact that I've never tried Korean food which lead her to suggest we go to this Korean restaurant that she knows, to which I replied ""usually it's me who picks the restaurant when I invite a woman out, but I'll open an exception because it's a good opportunity for me to try Korean food"" to which she replied enthusiastically ""you've earned points by considering taking me to that restaurant, well done"".

The D day
- I've picked her up at her workplace, we arrived early at the restaurant so we stayed in the car chatting for about an hour.
- We clicked right way, the environment was very easygoing and funny.
- She started fidgeting with her necklace whilst talking to me, initially she could not maintain eye contact and acted a bit shy.
- In the meantime I've held her hand to check her rings (obviously the rings part was an excuse, I just wanted to touch her and flirt).
- We talked and laughed a bit more and she unconsciously stretched her arm to touch my chest but she was very hesitant and even though she nearly touched it, she didn't.
- She showed DMs from other guys trying to hit on her, she showed me poems she wrote, she showed me her acting in a theatre (she wants to become an actress) and she also told me that a few days after her breakup, she went out with her friends and she was drunk and this random guy at the club tried to kiss her and she accepted it (only because she was drunk, she said) and although they shared IG handles, she told me she is not interested in him.
- In the meantime we've gone in for dinner and it went extremely well.
- After dinner we went to a quiet bar, but it was slightly dark. The bar had those individual comfy large chairs, we were close but not touching each other.
- For context, she sat with her legs crossed with her body facing me but legs stretched facing other direction because there was a table. Her arms were relaxed. We didn't drink alcohol.
- She never leaned on me but everytime I had to lean on her, she didn't retreat and allowed me to get closer. She's asked me to touch her shoulder (which is no big deal really) to feel some sort of bone injury and then I've told her to touch my shoulder as well (which she did). Apart from this we've touched multiple times randomly but she never initiated.
- We've stayed there talking for about 4 hours and she confided me a lot (and I mean a LOT) of personal stuff including the fact that she was sexually abused when she was younger and that sometimes she cries after sex. I've never experienced this sort of connection on a first hangout/date/whatever.
- I was really empathetic with her and rubbed her upper back like a way of comforting her, however she didn't react physically but made a ""puppy face"" while looking at me.
- In the meantime it was about 3 AM when she asked me to take her home because she had to work on the next day. To be honest I was tired as well.
- While driving her home she said that she told about me to her BFFs (both males and females). I've asked her what was their opinion about me and she replied ""they didn't say much"".
- I dropped her off (she lives with her parents BTW) > side hug > went back to my hotel.
- I was a bit disappointed because although I've invited her and paid for everything, she never said ""thanks"".

The next day
- She didn't say anything.
- I've sent her a voice message saying that I think that I'm not what she was expecting both physically and personally.
- She replied immediately saying that she didn't text me because she had 1% battery (I think this is bullshit) and when she woke up, she was late for work and that texting me slipped her mind (she seemed very apologetic).
- Also she told me that I'm wrong, that she really enjoyed meeting me in person and that I'm much better in person than she was expecting and it may not seem like that because of her ADHD but she reaffirmed that she really really enjoyed going out with me.
- She also told me that our time together wasn't a date but a hangout and that she's not looking for a relationship with anyone at the moment because she still loves her ex and is trying to get over him (which is fair enough).
- I've said to her that she is better in person than I was expecting and that she caused some sort of trigger in my mind that left me confused (I avoided stating directly that I was catching feelings), hence I don't want to be seen by her as a male BFF (she has at least 3 anyway), therefore we could not remain friends.
- She replied (texted) that she understands and respects my decision. She also thanked me for the great time we had and that she really enjoyed meeting me in person. I didn't reply to this.

A week later
- I've replied to her last message saying that I appreciate the fact that she was honest (about stating she still loves her ex) and that despite the fact that we're not friends, I'm in good terms with her. Basically I just wanted to let her know that my door is open but I'm moving on with my life.
- She replied on the same day stating that she believes she and her ex are not going back because they don't maintain contact and that she needs to grow and work on herself before getting envolved again with someone. She also reaffirmed that she really enjoyed our dinner/hangout, thanked me for listening her especially because she does NOT tipically open up and make herself vulnerable like she did with me.
- This last thing she said makes me feel special, so I reconsidered and messaged her back saying that I really don't want to cease contact with her and it was just a bad timing for us to meet because she broke up recently. I also said that I think she needs space and that if she wants to keep talking, we should do it a bit slower with the condition that we avoid talking about previous relationships and other guys (girls in my case), OR, if she prefers to go slient I'm OK with that.
- She replied immediately saying that I'm right, that she needs time and space to think about herself and her family and nothing else, and said that for the moment she'd rather remain silent with me. She also said that she will keep in mind that I've left my door open to listen to her if she needs.
- After this last message from her, I didn't reply and moved on with my life, it's been 2 weeks now. I stopped watching her IG stories but she always sees my stories, so basically we stopped interacting with each other.

Notes
- She subtly hits on some guys on Threads, I can see her replies, although she's only done it twice. For example, she's replied to the photo of a police officer something like ""this makes me want to behave badly"". (be aware that I do the same to other girls as well)
- Everyday she posts videos showing her outfit for the day, which leads me to believe she's seeking male attention.

Summary
I don't know what to do here, should I remain in no contact and forget about her? Or is there any hope that she gets over her ex and reaches out to me?
I mean, of course I could just move on and date other girls but I feel some sort of special connection (hard to explain with words) with this girl.

Second date, we do meet up for coffee and part of the conversation was previous jobs we had. And me being a lifeguard in college. Being not from America she told me she doesn’t know how to swim but wants to learn.


So when I told her I wanted to see her again for a third date. I suggested something like going and doing dinner. But she wanted to go swimming with me, in late November. And really she wants me to teach her to swim basically? 


We were supposed to go today, but her thanksgiving plans ended up taking all weekend. I’m going to text her later and tell her I’m thankful she came into my life.

I'm visiting Astana next week. Mostly for work but I hope to get a little spare time to explore the city. I have a few questions -

1. Is it possible to do a walking tour between the main sights? I really enjoy exploring cities by foot.
2. Are there any interesting food markets or flea markets I can visit? Or nice independent shops.
3. Any cool bar recommendations? I'm not really into posh clubs or cocktail bars but more dive bars and live music bars. Also if there's anywhere that serves good wine.
4. Is it possible to get a decent flat white coffee? Where's the best coffee spot.
5. Any nice neighbourhoods to explore - somewhere with independent shops and cafes.
6. Anywhere I should visit or anything I should do for an authentic Kazakh experience?

Due to reoccurring vaginal yeast infections, I’ve unfortunately spent a lot of time at the sexual health clinic recently. As a standard, they take a urine sample to test for pregnancy at every visit. 

Every time, they mention that they can see protein in my urine (sometimes tiny specks of blood too, though they said this is likely from my vulva due to the yeast infection, rather than anything inside my body). Of course they’ve been concerned about this so I’ve had 2 separate blood tests. Both blood tests came back normal, and doctors have been stumped, and have said it’s probably just my baseline.

Could it be due to endo on my bladder? Particularly recently I’ve noticed my bladder has been weaker. If I just drink water or juice it’s okay. But any sort of alcohol or coffee, and I’ll be peeing 3x an hour. I know it’s normal for coffee and alcohol to increase urine output, but surely not that much? I was on a night flight the other day, and had a coffee before boarding the plane, and I was in the middle seat. The poor guy in the aisle seat just wanted to sleep but I got up 5 times during the 3 hour flight. I felt so embarrassed that I lied and told him I was pregnant (I’m not) and he let me have the aisle seat.

When you incorporate gratitude into your everyday life, the benefits extend far beyond just feeling good in the moment—it can actually reshape your mindset, improve your relationships, and enhance your overall well-being. As we close out this week’s series on gratitude, let’s explore how you can make it a regular practice and why it’s worth the effort.

Why Practice Gratitude Every Day?
Making gratitude a daily habit may seem simple, but the impact can be profound. Here are some of the long-term benefits you might notice:

Improved Mental Health: Regular gratitude practice has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. By focusing on positive experiences, even if they’re small, you can gradually shift your mindset to be more optimistic.
Stronger Relationships: Expressing gratitude can strengthen your connections with others. When you regularly show appreciation for the people in your life, it fosters a deeper sense of connection and mutual support.
Better Sleep: Practicing gratitude before bedtime can improve sleep quality. Reflecting on the positive aspects of your day can help ease your mind and make it easier to wind down.
Increased Resilience: Gratitude helps you stay grounded during difficult times. When you regularly acknowledge the good in your life, it becomes easier to cope with stress and setbacks.
Enhanced Physical Health: Some studies suggest that people who regularly practice gratitude experience better physical health, including lower blood pressure and stronger immune systems.
How to Make Gratitude Part of Your Daily Routine
Building a daily gratitude habit doesn’t have to be complicated or time-consuming. Here are some practical ways to get started:

Gratitude Journaling:
Take a few minutes each day to jot down three things you're grateful for. This can be as simple as appreciating a warm cup of coffee or as meaningful as being thankful for a supportive friend. The goal is to create a daily ritual that helps you focus on the positives, even if they seem small.

Mindful Gratitude Breaks:
Set aside a few moments each day to reflect on things you’re thankful for. This could be during your morning routine, after lunch, or just before bed. You don’t need to overthink it—just pause, take a few deep breaths, and think about something positive.

Gratitude Walks:
Incorporate gratitude into your daily walk. As you move, notice and appreciate the small details around you—whether it’s the sound of birds chirping, a cool breeze, or a friendly hello from a neighbor. This approach combines mindfulness with physical activity, boosting the benefits.

Create a Gratitude Jar:
Keep a jar or container where you can drop in notes about things you’re thankful for throughout the day. Over time, you’ll accumulate a collection of positive experiences that can serve as a reminder during tough times.

Express Gratitude to Others:
Make it a habit to show appreciation to someone each day. This can be as simple as sending a text to thank a friend for their support or leaving a note for a colleague who helped you out. Expressing gratitude to others not only strengthens your relationships but also reinforces your own feelings of thankfulness.

Gratitude Prompts:
Use prompts to guide your daily reflections. For example, ask yourself, ""What made me smile today?"" or ""Who has helped me recently?"" These prompts can provide a structured way to start your gratitude practice.

Join a 30-Day Gratitude Challenge
To help you build momentum, consider taking on a 30-day gratitude challenge. It’s a structured way to integrate gratitude practices into your routine, and it doesn’t require a huge time commitment. Here’s a simple plan:

Week 1: Start with daily gratitude journaling. Write down three things you’re thankful for each day.
Week 2: Incorporate mindful gratitude breaks. Add a brief daily reflection on what you’re grateful for, either in the morning or before bed.
Week 3: Take gratitude walks and start a gratitude jar. Write down things you appreciate during your walk and add notes to the jar.
Week 4: Write a gratitude letter to someone who’s made a positive impact on your life. It doesn’t have to be sent—the act of writing can be powerful in itself.
Consistency is the key to experiencing the benefits. Remember, the goal isn’t to force yourself to be grateful when times are tough, but to cultivate a mindset that allows you to notice and appreciate the good, even in small ways.

A Reminder: Gratitude Is Not About Perfection
Gratitude isn’t about pretending life is perfect or ignoring challenges. It’s about developing a balanced perspective that acknowledges the good alongside the difficulties. When practiced regularly, gratitude can help build resilience, allowing you to better navigate life’s ups and downs.

I didn't feel myself leave my body, but it was more what I saw.

After earlier dreams, I walked into what looked like a McDonald's (no M sign) and pretty much everybody there stopped what they were doing and looked at me. My mother was there, Normally in waking life, my instinct would be to run to her, talk to her etc, but in the dream or whatever it was, I looked at her and she looked at me. I definitely got a vibe of 'what are you doing here?' but she seemed pleased to see me. There was definitely a feeling of a divide, but I couldn't make sense of whether she thought I was dead or I thought she was dead. I just knew we were apart but in that moment we were together.

I walked over to her table and picked up her cup of coffee, and took a sip of it. It had a rich flavour and I noticed it tasted like cow's milk (I tend to drink non-dairy). The others there were still sitting silently, looking at me with curiosity. I remember I started to cry.

Then I was somewhere else and I got the impression of a man - big and bulky, and almost like a barbarian. I told him (softly, and without any fear in the least) that I wasn't afraid of him, and I knew he couldn't stop me anymore (though he seemed able to whisk me out of there). And then I woke up, and I had tears in my eyes.

I don't know if that was astral or not, but it felt real and that coffee tasted more real than real.",6,1732899557.0,AstralProjection,2,1.0,False

Whether it’s a simple pour-over coffee, steamy latte, or lavish sugary beverage, coffee shop drinks have a way of warming you to your very core. Perhaps it has to do with the cafe’s ambiance or the seasonal drinks and decor that heighten your anticipation as you wait for your order. Or maybe it has to do with the simple fact that they’re made by someone else, and we all know how nice it feels to have someone make food or a drink for you!

Do you prefer to enjoy your drink at the cafe, take it with you on the go, or sip it slowly at a park while watching the world go by?

I'd be grateful for some advice on what to do!

I've had a little espresso-journey on my own, and have the intention to get a setup.

**History:**  
I very rarely drank coffee, until 2 years ago and it was strongly recommended to me after a hospital visit.   
I grew up with my parents having a Saeco full-auto, but the coffee ratio was very watered down. I never particularly enjoyed it.  
(Ironically, they only drink Turkish-style coffee in the past decades!).  
About 2 years ago I got a Nespresso machine. My wife and I considered this a real upgrade in coffee, we felt (and still do) that it tastes a lot better than most coffee/espresso served in most establishments.  
Visitors would give us compliments on how good our coffee tastes.  
There is a big corporate Franke A600 machine at work, but it's also not particularly tasty.

**A few months ago we went to Italy** on a trip and tried their espresso's everywhere. We were very surprised! They tasted so buttery and smooth (albeit somewhat burnt)! It took us a couple of weeks to adjust back again to our (now sad) Nespresso.

**Then:**  
I got us a Picopresso, to figure out if we could do things on our own, and have a 1Zpresso J-Ultra on order.  
The last couple of weeks, we're using Illy & Lavazza pre-ground, at a 1:1 extraction, and we like the texture and taste somewhat. It is miles better than our Nespresso. (I'm still waiting for the J-Ultra grinder)  
(1:1 because the texture is thicker, and we have the impression there is somewhat less caffeine in there. When we do 1:2, we get quite jittery). 

We have very little tasting experience, but we **both prefer medium & more light & floral notes rather than burnt/molasses**. However, we haven't been able to try lighter roasts in our area (Zurich/Switzerland) yet.  
(With Nespresso, we also prefer the lighter & medium intensity flavours rather than the burnt ones).

Then I knocked over the Picopresso setup with scalding water on myself, and my wife kindly suggested that we better get a less-fussy machine. (I'm also not so happy that the Picopresso is brewing inside plastic, as in other areas of life I try to avoid microplastics).

**Intention/Wishes**:

I don't want to micromanage and tinker with minor details. I want to be able to grind it and get something very nice tasting, without too much fuss other than initially with a new bean/roast.  
My wife would like the possibility to do Latte's.

We're commuting between 2 locations: \*\*Location:\*\* Belgium & Switzerland

**\*\*Budget\*\***: circa 1.000 CHF/EUR for the machine. 

**\*\*Grinder\*\***: 1Zpresso J-Ultra on order.

**\*\*Drink types:\*\*** espresso & latte, cappucino

**\*\*Drink frequency\*\*:** 2 drinks daily.

**\*\*Space:\*\*** ca 53cm height, 35cm width, 40cm deep (machine & grinder) & accessories (tiny kitchen)

I've already spent way too much time on reading & research.

**\*\*Shortlist\*\* (sorted by price ascending):**

\- Solis Barista Perfetta Plus (ca 250 CHF)  
\- Breville Bambino (ca 330 CHF)  
\- HiBrew H10 (270-370 EUR depending on version)  
\- Breville Bambino Plus (ca 560 CHF)  
\- AVX DB1 (\~MiiCoffee Apex) (ca 600 EUR)  
\- Flair 58 (but rather tall + need extra things for latte) (ca 650 CHF)  
\- Sage/Breville Dual Boiler (ca 900 CHF)  
\- Profitec Go (ca 950 CHF)

(slightly above budget: Ascaso Steel Uno PID: ca 1.300 CHF)

(most likely, I'll get a Gaggia Classic Pro + a gaggiuino kit for our 2nd location in Belgium, but it will be a project for next spring/summer).

\- I'm aware that the Solis & Sage/Breville machines are not the longest-term builds, and that is fine. If we can get 3-5 years out of them, that would be fine.

I see that the Solis has somewhat of a temperature control, and preinfusion, but I also see problem reports often.-Bambino (/Plus) might be enough for now, but perhaps (or perhaps not), we might miss that we can't make lighter roast (floral & sweetness. Or can that also be had from medium roasts?)

\- Then it's basically between Profitec Go and the Sage/Breville Dual Boiler, or the chinese machines. But then I'd like 5-10 years of durability

Born in France, he grew up in Africa and settled in London 27 years ago after a post-graduate course in a mathematical field.

Standing at 184 cm (6ft) with a slim toned build, he is very active physically, waking up early to workout every day. He goes to the gym and cycles to work in the City. He enjoys running, by himself or at park runs, albeit slowly for now as he's recovering from injury. He feels he has perfected his sleep, diet, and exercise. He is focused on his family and his physical and mental health.

His nature is calm, low anxiety, nil drama, independent, conscientious, genuine, facetious, self-deprecating, and goal-oriented. He is a blue INTP/J. He enjoys time with his children and time by himself, spending his weekends immersed in nature and engaging in physical activities, often at outdoor gyms or skate parks, sometimes volunteering for the Royal Parks. He would like to go hiking more often and start wild camping. He loves big skies, sunsets, and sunrises. He avoids crowds and noise.

It is hard to believe English is not his first language when you first meet him, but he can dial up the gallic charm if desired. He thoroughly enjoys the snobbery of English grammar and punctuation, and so he deludes himself that he can plausibly deny his share of responsibility in misunderstandings.

He has an adventurous spirit, often rollerblading in traffic, swimming in lakes and rivers, taking ice baths and going shirtless in winter. He likes to sleep on the floor, opts not to have a sofa, enjoys breathwork and sauna. He values time offline, doesn’t watch Netflix or TV, doesn’t follow the news. He sees smoking and drinking as unhealthy and unromantic.

Loyal and truthful, he has had only two relationships, which ended after thirteen and seven years of marriage due to personality differences. He wished he had spent more time nurturing his loved ones instead of working long hours, but he doesn't wallow. As a responsible parent, he wanted to stay together for the kids. As a single father, he prioritises his children's needs and has a better work-life balance now.

He has moderate political views, if any, and he would not define these according to party lines. He believes each topic needs thinking on its own, and he is open to changing his mind as new perspectives emerge. He is scientific, hyper logical, curious, and playful. He likes to challenge assumptions and irrational beliefs. Baptised Catholic as a baby, he converted to Islam to please someone, but he is really agnostic. His four children are mixed from several continents. He is proficient in dad jokes. He believes one should eat what they like in harmony with their own health and environmental values. He only eats meat, only drinks water and home-made raw goat milk kefir, and enjoys fasting occasionally.

He has worked on himself and he is happy being single. But he is open to the possibility of meeting the right woman. He is not looking for a step-parent or nanny, nor someone to share the bills. He likes children and he is open to someone with or without. He would not make more unless there’s a trust fund. He has had little or no sex life for years, and he is not looking to rush into physical intimacy. He aspires to a life-long relationship. He is conventional but open-minded about sex positivity.

What he really misses is the intellectual intimacy. He is seeking mature, witty, challenging, deep introspective conversations and high-brow humour. He is attracted to a woman who can make fun of him and keep up the repartee. He values time together, openness and honesty, clear and direct communication. He is romantic and literal, with a positive view of therapy which he has done for himself. He feels he and his partner should be able to talk respectfully as adults when they are upset, working together to articulate their needs, feelings, and emotions.

He enjoys museums and galleries, theatre and stand-up. Bars and clubs are strictly no-go areas. He wears smart casual on a date. He would like to go cross-country skiing and river ice-skating. His family commitments won’t allow many extended couple-only holidays. He has some concern about planes damaging the planet.

Finally, he does not have a pet but he gets on with large and medium-size dogs.

If you have read all the way to here, he would like to meet you over coffee. He's not into texting or calling, but he is happy to answer questions online.",1,1732898885.0,u_ExcusesDontBurnKCals,0,1.0,False

I’m looking for gifts for my fiancé. We are finally in a financial place where I can splurge on a gift idea instead up making sure it’s under $50. We’ve been together for 9 years. He’s a very sweet, and romantic man. He is genuinely obsessed with the beauty of my smiles and eyes; whereas I am all logic and show my love through actions and logic. I struggle to meet him romantically and he’s still so in love. I wanna make this year special with his gift, but my ideas feel basic. I’ve even considered getting a tattoo. Here’s a list of basic characteristics of him
-he loves things like bears, bees, honey

-he loves the years where he was a barista and a bartender. He’s so creative 

-He’s got adhd and autism but definitely adhd so heavily 

-Loves gaming on laptop

-loves spooky and creepy videos

-Big foodie; he’s a cook, and bartender, and barista (I scored so hard)

-loves tattoos but only has two; he wants a sleeve but wants every tattoo to be meaningful so he’s picky

-cat guy for sure

-he’s 35

-we are big on YouTube; Smosh, dropout 

-he’s a big guy, I love him and he’s definitely givin “Big Boy” energy 

-We are both Hispanic and Asian 

-we love eating food and watching videos together

-Coffee and ice cream are key marks in our relationship

-we have very fucked up senses of humor, just pure chaos and terrible morals 

-we have a switch

1h2pyby,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1h2pyby/what_do_i_want/,What do I want?,"I talked to my best friend the other day about my failed dating experiences. It’s something that’s been on my mind for a while now because, quite frankly, dating has felt more exhausting than fulfilling lately. I found myself connecting with guys for reasons that seemed good at the time, but ultimately, there was always something missing.

Some of these guys didn’t want to commit, even though they asked for my attention. Once they had it, they seemed to pull away, unsure of what they wanted. Others didn’t share the same values as me, or worse, treated me like their personal therapist, needing emotional support without ever reciprocating. It was draining—so much so that I reached a point where I didn’t want to entertain anyone anymore.

And so, I started asking myself: What do I want?

I want to be the most important person in someone’s life. You know that feeling when you think about someone, and they think about you at the same time? That’s what I want. Someone who not only sees me but gets me. Someone who pays attention to the little details—the way I like my coffee, the foods I enjoy, the ones I avoid. The kind of person who’ll listen when I want to talk about a book I’ve just finished or a series I’ve binge-watched and need to discuss.

But beyond that, I want someone willing to look toward the future with me. Someone who sees a future in us, together. I want someone who understands that, despite my independent, “I’ve got it all together” persona, I’m still human. I have my messes, my insecurities, and my vulnerabilities. I need help sometimes, and it’s okay to admit that. I want to be with someone ready to give as much as I am—who appreciates the love and effort I’m willing to pour into a relationship.

In my experience, love is never steady. It’s not the smooth, calm feeling that we see in movies. No, love has a way of gradually turning into something all-consuming. Infatuation can take over, and sometimes, we lose sight of who we are in the process. We become so overwhelmed by the force of it that we forget to check in with ourselves. We forget that love should add to our lives, not consume it.

That’s why I’ve concluded that I will only accept someone into my life when they truly align with what I need. Not because I need them, but because I want them. I’ve worked so hard for my peace, independence, and emotional and mental well-being. I’ve spent years building this version of myself, and I’m not willing to settle for anything less than what I deserve. I’m setting the bar high, and I’m unapologetic about it.

I’ve learned that I don’t need anyone to complete me. But I do want someone who complements me, someone who shares my values, my vision, and my ability to both give and receive love in a balanced way. Love isn’t about fixing one another; it’s about finding a person who appreciates your flaws, encourages your growth, and respects your individuality while growing together.

So, what do I want? I want someone who sees me for who I am—flaws and all—and wants to build a life with me, not because they need me, but because they genuinely want me in their life. I’m setting high standards because I know my worth. And if that means waiting for the right person who truly meets these standards, then I’m okay with that.

I’ve worked too hard for my peace to settle for anything less than the love I truly deserve.

1h2pyah,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1h2pyah/i_feel_im_having_really_early_pre_labor/,I feel I’m having REALLY early pre labor symptoms…but how long did yours last,"So for about 5-7 days I’ve been having more interesting symptoms. I’ve never been in labor on my own nor did I ever get any pre labor symptoms. I was medically induced with my first. 

I’m 30+1 (so plenty viable), but I felt like they had dropped (which I feel has disengaged yesterday), but movements were a lot lower, I went out to breakfast 2 days ago for a friends birthday & had a latte. I’m used to drinking a cup of coffee a day and when traveling earlier in the morning to town I will get a 1 shot espresso but I’m fairly used to 2 shots (and no I don’t drink anymore caffeine beyond that). I got done with breakfast, got 3/4 thru the latte and had GI distress stomach cramps (TMI) used the restroom, that happened again a couple more times when I got home. 

I’ve had very low back discomfort on and off it’s always been constant, but it’s different than the discomfort I’ve been having just throughout this whole time. 

Food was REALLY hard to eat yesterday (which I’ve already struggled with the is whole time but it was worse yesterday and worse today. 

Yesterday my stomach was uncomfortably tight for ~2 hours straight. It eventually went away and that was that.

This morning I had a 8oz keurig drip coffee and same GI issue without the cramping.

I’ve had this gut feeling they’d come early from the beginning.

But my L&D department always just asks leaking fluid? Blood? Or regular 5-10 apart contractions (which is a definite no).

SO IM LOST.

>!Our host got pretty triggered by something the night before last (a friend of ours who is also a system had an abrupt restructuring and he's not handling it super well because the previous host (his best friend the last six years) is missing in head space and no one knows when she'll be back), and we're pretty sure that our protector (Adam) pulled us out of one of our worst nightmares about our abusive ex that we've had in awhile. !<

So most of the day we were feeling... Weird. Not quite fully Roz and not quite anyone else until the house went to go look at Christmas lights at the local racetrack. On the way back, Adam got pulled to the front because Roz started to get really anxious in a gas station which was absolutely PACKED and they were co-fronting for a bit. 

Which lead to the most interesting part of the evening which is what we wanted to share:

1) Three of us (Roz, Adam and Laurent) all tried the same cup of coffee and had three *entirely* different experiences drinking it. We already knew that our tastes are different -- Adam doesn't like sweet things, Morgan likes artificial peach when the rest of us think its gross, I can handle spicier food that the rest of us...

It went pretty much like follows:  
Roz hated it because he didn't add enough creamer to overcome the watery coffee.  
Adam tasted it as simultaneously unbearably bitter and watered down, as well as burnt declaring it a ""terrible"" cup of coffee.  
Laurent drank almost the entire thing because ""it's just mediocre gas station coffee..."" 

2) Our second shyest alter (Laurent) got to spend most of the night with our partner after Adam got frustrated at our current lack of teeth (working on getting dentures) and discovered that despite our host and several of our other members being able to sing pretty well, Laurent can't carry a tune *at all.* He also cannot draw like, at all.

This is pretty big for us since we always feel like we're Faking It because of the lack of a memory barrier and being more of an OSDD1a type system (no official dx but it fits really well) but tonight we got several pretty good bits of ""evidence"" that something is actually happening outside of our full control in our brain. It's not acting, it's not roleplaying as the various people in here.

Anyway, we just wanted to share this because it's pretty big for us to have these sorts of experiences and we wanted to share the joy of that discovery!

Now her mother is guilting my mother and my uncle about not going (it's bullshit, but it's something that my aunt is doing, NOT MY COUSIN).

Obviously this comes up at Thanksgiving which was at my house this year with my uncle and his family. 

Because my aunt has decided to behave that way, my uncle has taken it upon himself to rehash how upset he was that my cousin chose to have her wedding at a venue most people couldn't go to. I tried to point out that my cousin hasn't tried to guilt trip anyone about not going and that my aunt has a history of guilt tripping people outside of anything her daughter is doing. 

BUT THEN my uncle goes off about my cousin's first marriage when she had this huge wedding everyone was invited to and she married this guy who was really in love with her and then she divorced him in less than 6 months.

I get that there are people out there like my uncle who would judge my cousin like crazy for that, but at the end of the day it's not really any of my business. Shit happens and it was TEN YEARS AGO. 

If I spent my time upset about divorces I wasn't involved in that happened 10 years ago, I'd go insane. Like my uncle has apparently.

My uncle then goes on to say that he doesn't think her new marriage will last 5 years.

What a shitty thing to say and his wife was right there with him.

His wife who doesn't talk to any of her family because they all can't stand her anymore so now she has bother my family who doesn't cut people off. 

Because unlike my uncle I'm not the type of person to insult people at Thanksgiving, I got up and left and made myself a coffee in the kitchen to calm down, but goddamnit I just got more angry and I'm still angry the day after.",2,1732898592.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

","It's been said from the start, Kendu Inu was created to be a multi cycle project. The price action that we are witnessing now for the project is crucial for creating a proper distribution of tokens so that long term growth is achievable. Consider it an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to enter a project as established and committed as Kendu at these levels. Here's a very brief look into the ecosystem if you are not familiar.

**Facts**

* We are the cusp of having 15K holders
* Kendu is almost 10 months old
* We rank top 10% in subreddit size
* We have an NFT platform that is still yet to be fully deployed
* Kendu is on ETH but will bridge to SOL (and most likely other chains such as BASE)
* Coinbase Wallet featured Kendu in their advertisement (every other coin featured in the same advert is now listed on Coinbase)
* We have Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu jewelry, Kendu merch, and much more.
* We have had several articles written about us in Shib Magazine
* Kendu Miazaki (dev of Kendu) is going to be speaking at Shibcon about Kendu
* We hit an ATH of 280M back in June before the bullrun even started
* We have the best organic community in the space, bar none
* A juicy fact about kendu, it's the only coin that is backed up with a campaign on okx (the second largest exchange ) [https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu](https://www.okx.com/campaigns/kendu-inu)

Why is all of this relevant? I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the ""bullrun"". Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market. Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive.

We are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase. Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun.

There is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends.

""You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have:  
\- Inspired people hustling daily  
\- 6+ months old  
\- Survived multiple large drops  
\- Holder Count growing every month  
\- $20 Billion+ Target  
\- Great Distribution + Diamondhands""

Kendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well.

Join the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like. Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.",25,1732898255.0,CryptoMoon,8,1.0,False

I met this girl on Hinge, and we've only gone on two dates so far. We're both recent college graduates from out of state who moved to the same city for work. On our first date, we connected well at a new bakery as we shared ethnicity (which was rare in the city we’re at), we both work in corporate, and both having the same breed of dog back at our families’ homes. After the date, she texted me first to thank me for treating her to coffee and pastries, and mentioned that she had a great time. I responded that I enjoyed it too and suggested we do something again, which she said she gladly be open to.
My concern is that I'm not sure if she’s really interested in me, as sometimes she responds late, especially during weekdays, which I totally understand because we both work in demanding corporate jobs. Her job is a lot more demanding than me as her industry usually requires entry levels to work at least 60 hours a week.

But her texts are never dry, though—she responds enthusiastically and in multiple texts, and she only responds promptly in weekend or soon before/after our dates. On our second date, which was the weekend before Thanksgiving, I took her to a nice restaurant. We had a great conversation throughout the entire time, and she asked a lot of questions about me. She even casually suggested future plans we could do, but we didn't make solid plans for our next meetup since we were both were flying to visit our families for Thanksgiving and we wouldn’t see each other for almost 2 weeks.
After the date, I walked her to her car, she told me she had a lot of fun and we hugged goodbye. I texted her that I had a great time and wished her a fun Thanksgiving. She responded that she had a great time too and thanked me for dinner. She also asked me to send pictures of my dog when I see him during the break. A week later, I sent her some pictures of my dog, and she replied saying he was adorable and mentioned that she was visiting her cousin at the moment and will send pictures of her dog later in the week when she visits her parents.

Now, it’s been several days since then, and I’m feeling anxious that she may not follow up with the pictures, especially since I assume she’s at her parent’s home. At this point, I feel like she’s not interested in me anymore since I’ve haven’t heard back from her with the dog pics.

In two hours, I’m meeting a friend for coffee—a friend I made while working earlier this year. I’m feeling scared, anxious, and completely overwhelmed, so I wanted to share my story and ask for your advice.

I (F) graduated in July this year, and my family encouraged me to set a goal to challenge my “awkwardness” and anxiety. (For context, my teachers, who genuinely cared about me, had told my parents that I might be high-functioning autistic. My parents kept that in mind but never got me to get diagnosed. I don’t plan on that.) The goal was to get a job that involved talking to people, which I managed to do as a cashier in a busy chain market.

The market was a bit far from home, about nine subway stops away, I settled in with the team of six employees. One of them, who happened to live close to me, became a close friend for me at that time. She was the kind of extrovert who makes everyone feel at ease. She helped me learn the job, showed me alternate ways to get to work, and we spent time together grabbing coffee outside of work.

She quit after a week (I took her position), but she would occasionally visit the market when she was in the area. I worked there for four and a half months before quitting to focus on myself and prepare for an upcoming exam. It’s been two months since I last saw her.

On her birthday (about a month and a half ago), I messaged her congratulating, and this afternoon, unexpectedly, she called me. She asked how I was and if I wanted to grab coffee tonight around 10 pm. I said yes immediately.

Now, I’m panicking. I’m scared she won’t like me anymore or that I’ll somehow disappoint her, making her regret asking me out for coffee. But at the same time, I’m so happy she called because I don’t really have any other friends.

I’d love your advice on how I should behave or what I should talk about during our coffee meet-up. 

Now I should tell you about my use of ChatGPT, I used it to rewrite the paragraph I’ve sent (I’m not an English speaker). Sorry. ",4,1732897889.0,socialanxiety,0,0.84,False

My skin burns less frequently than it use to but the aches on my back, arms and legs are very troublesome. I use a cane occasionally for the hip pain and limp. 

I can handle myself most of the time, but when I lay down, ready for bed on those bad days, I hate how my body feels. I miss not worrying about my arm falling asleep when I try to sleep in case. I don’t want to move in the wrong position. 

I don’t do much with my day anymore. I try to do things but I had to withdrawal from school and I am looking for a job, so I’m idle if not doing chores. I feel like being idle makes this difficult. 

I hate the fuzzy feeling, the limb heaviness and like my fingers are swollen when their not. 
I think drinking coffee again is making this worse, I am taking a vitamin B complex drop and it has rained every other day after the drought my area just had so it’s a big weather change that is causing this strange flare up I guess. I don’t know….

1h2pkvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1h2pkvo/all_the_warning_signs_red_flags_i_ignored_because/,all the warning signs / red flags i ignored because i thought things would get better. dont make the same mistakes i did.,"**TLDR: don't miss the red flags to save yourself from heartbreak. a lot of things that i could've used as leverage to leave but didn't due to attachment and ultimately made my emotional well-being worse. he never took accountability and i can't help but hope for some sort of karma to come his way. moral of the story is to be kind to yourself first especially if they are treating you poorly.**

thinking back on the relationship, there were so many instances where i had the opportunity to break things off, but i was not strong enough / didn't respect myself enough. im going to list them all below in order to get things off my chest and in hopes that other people can learn from my mistakes. these are some things i wish he understood was absolutely not okay, but he was too insecure, a coward, and too selfish to even feel remorse or apologize (avoidant attachment). he ended up checking out of the relationship early, led me on for another 4 months, and left me heartbroken.

**1.** **a year into our relationship i caught him using dating apps.**  
we woke up in the morning and he went to use the bathroom. after he came back we were looking at things on his phone and i saw that he had hinge open in his recent apps. i confronted him about it and his excuse was ""i just needed to talk to someone to get a new perspective on the things i was dealing with."" what does that mean.... i asked him why he wouldn't just talk to me about it and he didnt really have a good answer. i asked him to delete the apps on his phone - hinge, tinder, riya, coffee meets bagel, bumble. i was upset with him and told him that wasn't okay, but he didnt really try to make things better. i ended up caving because i was already so attached. this is when i should've broken up with him.

**2. when i met his mother for the first time, she jokingly called me a ""greedy a\*\* b\*\*\*\*.""**  
it was christmas time and his mother was visiting. we were sitting on his couch and he was telling us that he was making something (he's a jeweler and super crafty) and i jokingly was like ""are you making one for me ?"" as he had made things for me in the past. after i said that his mother said ""you're a greedy a\*\* b\*\*\*\* ahahahah"" and then immediately gaslit me after saying ""oh don't be upset you're gonna make me cry."" my jaw dropped to the floor. im here trying to make a good first impression on a SO's parent and here she is insulting me. mind you she is 60+ years old. how do you expect me to bond after that ? i sat there thinking i should leave and was looking to him for some help and comfort, but he just laughed along with her.... a few days later i told him how i felt about the situation and all he said was ""that's just how she is."" i didn't know what to say to that, but i wish i had stood up for myself.

**3. the first time i cried in public while i was with him, he said i** **needed to stop because it made him look bad.**  
we live in nyc, it's normal to see people crying on the street. when you see someone crying you just mind your own business and keep walking unless they're in immediate danger or something. i have cried out and about in nyc several times. it's just something that happens. i don't exactly remember what i was upset about but we were grabbing coffee and i was crying otw there. we get to the coffee shop and he tells me to stop crying because people are going to think he did something to me and it's going to make him look bad. *i had never had anyone tell me that in my life.* typically, if i was crying whoever im with would be comforting me, but no, my boyfriend was too selfish to see past his own insecurities. i honestly couldn't grasp how that was his thought process. i should've iterated that no ones going to think you hurt me unless you are doing it publicly, and moreover, they wouldn't have felt that way if you were actually comforting me. also who the fuck cares what strangers think ?! the second time this happened, he stormed away from me and left me standing on the street alone because he didn't want to be seen with me.

**4.  he never said ""i love you"" to me, not once.**  
i'm pretty scarred from this one. like i mentioned above he was avoidant so it was already hard to get him to tell me anything about his feelings. we were at a place in our relationship where it was appropriate to say i love you and i really wanted to say that to him. whenever i told him that i loved him he would pick me up and hug me or say ""love ya lots."" it always just a thing he brushed passed and i had hoped we'd just get to a point where he would be comfortable to say ""i love you"" back to me. i don't know what i was thinking because i just let him treat me this way. all i really wanted was to feel the love and be assured that he loved me back, but that never really happened. it makes me feel like maybe he never loved me to begin with...

**5. he never texted me back, made excuses when he took too long, and when he did text back it was very nonchalant.**  
this was extremely frustrating as i had kept asking him to communicate things with me. in the beginning of our relationship, he didn't really initiate things and was always beating around the bush or being super vague. whenever i asked him to hang out, his responses would be along the lines of ""im kinda tired and have low energy, but im around if you want"" ......... ... ..... .. .... i was always confused as to if he wanted to hang out with me or not. ""i guess i could make that work"" ""should i hang out with my friends or did you want to get dinner"" ""sure if you want"" all the things he said made me feel like he didn't give a fuck. he also never commuted to me and i was always going to his. towards the end of the relationship, he was texting me every 3-5 days. when he did respond he would say ""sorry i had too much to drink that day"" and that was his excuse every. single. time. im not even joking it got to a point where it was just utterly pathetic and predictable. i should've just ignored him completely and given the same level of effort he was. but after 2 years of dating how do you just not text your SO back ? my therapist also said that that's not how a boyfriend behaves.

**6. he said i should be doing things people my age should be doing.**  
i (24f) am someone that goes out occasionally but not a lot. i spent a lot of time in college partying and doing drugs so i was kinda in the process of moving on from it post college. i have a lot of projects in my life aside from my full time job so i am more focused on work. he (31m) kept fixating on the fact that i was younger than him and that he felt like he was hindering my life experiences of being 24. first of all everyone is different. him at 24 is not the same as me at 24, especially when i had already partied hard. clubbing and shit like that was tiring for me. don't get me wrong, i still went out, but never to the extent of coming home past 2am. but who is he to tell me that i had to live a certain way or the way he expected me to ? secondly, he never wanted to go out with me unless he was lowkey obligated to. he felt bad that he didnt want to do things with me but didnt do anything to change that. i had tried to implement things for us to do together but he never followed through because it felt like a chore to him. so him wanting me to go out and do things but then telling me he doesn't want to do them with me was just flat out horrible for him to do.

there's definitely more things that i can continue listing, but these are the things that i have lost sleep over and needed to get off my chest. im not actively trying to seek vengeance because im not that type of person and it feels pointless / waste of energy, but **i can't help but feel like hoping that some sort of karma comes his way because he never owned up to anything.** i know now at this point that you live and you learn. i will never repeat these mistakes again as i know better and love myself. thank you for taking the time to read this and i'd appreciate any relatable sentiments.",2,1732897793.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I am a 34-year-old full-time electrical engineer, and I’ve been starting businesses since I was 15. Over the years, I’ve officially launched four businesses. Sometimes I made great money, and other times I lost everything. I currently have a full-time job that provides enough for an average life, but there’s always something inside me pushing to start something new. I don’t know where this drive comes from. There isn’t a single person in my family, even among distant relatives, who has ever started or owned a business. Yet, I was that kid in the neighborhood knocking on doors, trying to sell something to everyone.

Now, I’ve started my fifth business. I’ve been working on a product I call “[The Date Ring](https://thedatering.com/)” It’s a unique ring with four adjustable digits that can display any meaningful date. With two buckles, you can lock the date in place and wear it as a reminder. The idea came to me when I was searching for a meaningful first-anniversary gift for my girlfriend.

# 3D Programs I’ve Used

[Designing The Date Ring at a Coffee Shop — Whittier, CA, 2023](https://preview.redd.it/3cw345a29v3e1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ceeb57a362f1ab89f0a8294ff5aee81a59a244b)

I sketched the idea on paper, and I’ve always been in love with 3D design programs and 3D printers. That’s why I spend most of my days off designing new things. I use [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/) because I believe it’s one of the best 3D design programs available. It’s much simpler to learn and use compared to many others. However, SolidWorks doesn’t offer free access to its software. If you have a student email address or are an official startup, you can get a discounted price. If you’re looking for a free 3D design app, I recommend [Autodesk Fusion](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) (if you have a student account).

I also rely heavily on my iPad Mini (6th Gen), which is incredibly convenient for on-the-go designing. I’ve been exploring [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com/), an excellent 3D design app that supports Apple Pencil and also has a desktop version. While the [$38 monthly subscription](https://www.shapr3d.com/pricing) was steep for what I needed, I was able to access it for free with my student email. It’s a great tool for quick, simple designs, especially on an iPad. For more complex projects, I recommend using the desktop version.

# 3D Printers I’ve Used

The Date Ring was designed using SolidWorks, a process that took me four days to complete. I made several iterations because the mechanism didn’t work as intended when I first printed the parts. 3D printers are some of my favorite tools because they let you create and refine your prototypes. They’ve been invaluable in identifying and fixing errors in my designs.

For my prototypes, I used a [Creality Ender 3](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/creality-store-ender-3-v3-ke-3d-printer-on-sale). It’s not the most advanced printer on the market, but it’s reliable and gets the job done. The best 3D printer I’ve used, however, is the [Bambu Lab X1C](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon?sscid=a1k8_12ksvm). While it costs around $1,000, it’s the most reliable and efficient printer I’ve ever tested.

# Graphic Design Tool

I don’t like having too many subscriptions, especially for small tasks. A couple of years ago, I got a yearly subscription to Adobe for all their programs, but after a while, I realized it was much more complex than I had thought, and I didn’t want to spend time learning new tools for very simple graphic design. I canceled my membership after just a month, but they didn’t provide any refund. Since then, I’ve promised myself never to use Adobe programs again. That’s when I discovered [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). It’s incredibly user-friendly and doesn’t require installing heavy applications just to complete a few graphic design tasks.

# Cork Box for the Date Ring

[Cork Box for the Date Ring](https://preview.redd.it/aqi7w7ye9v3e1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cab19783b1574136c6b337ce364d1a4a80ba5a8)

I designed my logo, experimented with a few pictures, and used them to create the instruction manual and the paper box pattern. I also designed a cork box for the ring, and it looks amazing in my opinion.

**The Journey So Far**

After finalizing my prototype, I sent the design to a manufacturer in China nearly a year ago. Now, my first production line is about to arrive! This journey has been incredible, and I’ve learned so much along the way.

As we all know losing weight basically all comes down to a lower calorie intake than output. I believe a strong part of being successful in doing so is about developing healthier eating habits. And like with so many habits (or self imposed rules) to improve oneself, I'm in favor of learning from the successes of others. I think its true that copying what works for successful people is a great way to find your own way.

I want to compile a set of rules people live by, which have worked for you personally. And this is not just to copy, but to learn and potentially adapt to to fit my own goals. Reading through the quick start guide and other various sources, I already captured some ideas:

* Logging all food intake.
* Weigh every day.
* Don't eat before or after certain time of the day.
* Volume-eating.
* Only eat (three) proper meals and no more snacks.
* Don't eat food just because its offered to you for free.
* Say no to all non-planned non-scheduled food.
* No more liquid calories. No sugar in tea or coffee; no sugary soda's or juices.
* Meal prepping. Avoid last-minute unhealthy food choices.
* Limiting of processed foods.

What are your personal rules, habits or guidelines that have made a/the difference in your weight loss journey? Do you have any particular strategies that you swear by?

1h2pbgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h2pbgt/i_found_an_indie_game_thats_way_too_real_part_1/,I Found an Indie Game That’s Way Too Real - part 1,"I’m not usually the type to post here, but something’s been gnawing at me, and I need a second opinion. It started a couple of weeks ago when I stumbled on this obscure indie game called **Blood Detective**. I’m a sucker for anything dark and gritty, so I figured I’d give it a shot. The game’s premise is simple: you’re a detective solving a series of murders in a fictional city.

But here’s the thing—one of the murders in the game feels... too familiar.

There’s a case I read about years ago. A guy was found dead in an abandoned house, staged like he was sitting at a dinner party. The killer had dressed him in a tuxedo, set the table with rotting food, and even lit candles. It was sick, but what really stood out to me was a random detail: the victim had a rose sewn into his chest.

Guess what’s in the game? The same exact setup.

I thought it was just a weird coincidence. Indie devs pull inspiration from real life all the time, right? But then I noticed something else. The game gave an address for the crime scene—a random house in its fictional world. For fun, I plugged the address into Google Maps. The real-world location is an actual abandoned house. And it looks *exactly* like the one in the game.

At this point, I should’ve walked away. Instead, I dug deeper.

I started cross-referencing other murders in the game with real-world cases. Two more matched. Different locations, different victims, but the details in the game were spot on. Right down to stuff that wasn’t made public, like how one victim was missing a tooth or how another had a specific tattoo.

I know how crazy this sounds, but I can’t shake the feeling that whoever made this game knows more than they should.

I’ve been combing through forums and old case files, trying to figure out where the dev got their info. I’ve even been poking around in the game’s files—nothing illegal yet, just some harmless snooping. The deeper I go, the worse it gets.

Here’s the kicker: last night, I got a notification that the game updated. A new chapter dropped, with another murder to solve. The opening screen? A map zooming in on my town.

I couldn’t resist checking out the new chapter. I loaded it up, fully expecting the usual eerie vibes. Instead, the game dropped me straight into a map screen—only this time, it wasn’t the fictional city anymore. It was a pixelated version of my actual town.

At first, I thought I was imagining things. The street names were slightly different, but the layout? Perfect match. My apartment building was even on there.

I started exploring, clicking through the map. The game let me zoom in on houses, including *mine*. That’s when I noticed something that nearly made me shut the whole thing down. My building was marked with a red X.

Naturally, I panicked. I tried to rationalize it—maybe this was a coincidence, maybe the devs pulled real-world data for the game’s map system. But then the game’s detective character popped up, pixelated and silent, and walked straight into my building.

The screen went black for a moment. When it loaded again, the detective was inside an apartment. It was *my apartment*.

I’m not exaggerating. The details were spot on—the crappy beige walls, the mismatched furniture, even the stack of empty coffee mugs on my desk. I don’t know how the devs did it, but they recreated my living space down to the last detail.

Then, the detective walked into my bedroom. I could feel my heart pounding as the screen showed my bed, unmade like I’d left it. On the nightstand was a single rose.

That’s when the game threw up a dialogue box. One line: *""Are you ready to play?""*

I slammed my laptop shut and sat there in silence for a good five minutes. I haven’t opened the game since, but I feel like I’m being watched. My blinds are closed, my phone’s camera is taped over, and I’ve started sleeping with a bat under my bed.

Here’s the thing, though. The rational part of my brain is telling me this has to be a sick prank—some genius dev who found my info online and decided to mess with me. But the rest of me? It’s screaming that there’s more to this.

I’ve been digging into the game files again, but they’re encrypted to hell. I found what looks like a user ID in the metadata, though. If I can crack it, I might be able to trace it back to the creator.",9,1732897096.0,nosleep,1,0.85,False
