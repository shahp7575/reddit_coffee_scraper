“Dammit!”



I wiped the sweat from my brow and spat a wad of chaw into the snow. You’d think it impossible to sweat in such weather. But by God, we’d been roughing it for days straight. Ever since we left LesMoine, and I gotta say, I’m a tired son of a gun.



Before me, amongst a dusting of fresh snow, were the remnants of the Mason family’s caravan. Two dead oxen collapsed in a heap, missing their heads, surrounded by blood with the consistency of tar and the color of rust.



“Doc,” I called out. “Whatchu make of it?”



“Oxen are dead, old boy,” he said.



“No kiddin’.”



Doc Caine, despite the cold and darkness and dreary of our situation, began to laugh. He was a lanky fellow with pale skin and shaggy ginger hair. Freckles over his face, eyes a glacial blue shade, fat nose with thin lips hidden behind a bushy mustache that curled on either end. Dressed in a pressed frock coat, dark trousers, and a derby hat on his head.



Southern native who came up our way about ten or fifteen years back. He handled the cold better than me, but then again, copperheads spent most of their time out of the sun. Didn’t know what it meant to be warm.



“Judging from blood coagulation,” Doc said, “I’d reckon they’d been out of commission about a day, give or take.”



I turned over my shoulder. “Annie, you any idea what done somethin’ like this happen?”



Annie Hoont, born and bred in the LesMoine area. Tall girl of twenty and two. Came from a family of hunters, frontiersmen, and surveyors.



She had long black hair tucked into a bandannoe. Built hard in the face. Dark bags around her eyes, sort of like a coon. Hollow cheeks and a rigid jaw. Lean in frame, sinewy. All bone and muscle. Wore a leather duster with a fur-lined collar. Walked and spoke with the swagger of a gambler.



“Never seen anything like it,” she said. “Most predators wouldn’t waste the meat. Any that do are smaller game. Owls, hawks, and the like.”



Doc kneeled beside the oxen, inspecting their wounds with a flea glass. Eyebrows knitted, lips pursed, mustache trembling against the wind. “Wasn’t done with a bonesaw or a knife, from what I can tell. Looks to be partially cut and partially ripped.”



“Cut by what?” I asked.



“Claws, maybe.”



Annie snorted and turned back for our horses. “I’m gettin’ the Remington.”



“Steady yourself now,” I called after her. “Whatever killed ‘em is prob’ly long gone.”



I turned toward the Mason family’s covered wagon, upended, wheels pointing south. The linen canvas was shredded to ribbons and pinned against the ground. Clothes were strewn about. Canteens empty, provisions depleted. No blood within, though.



“Cabrón, I’ve got tracks over here,” Deputy Mendoza said.



Short man with broad shoulders. Darker skin, walrus mustache, long black hair tied at the back of his head. Wide-brimmed Stetson hanging from his neck. He wore a hooded gaban made of wool. Beneath was a denim overcoat with a cotton inner lining.



According to Sheriff MacReady, Mendoza had been a border officer down in southern California. When the going got tough, he migrated northeast, working the rails and mines. Eventually, he got lucky, found a place in LesMoine.



MacReady wasn’t perfect, but he knew loyalty when he saw it and admired hard work over almost anything else.



“Annie, check out them tracks, see where they lead.” To Doc, I said, “Whatchu reckon here? Any of ‘em still alive?”



“If they weren’t, there’d be more blood,” Doc said. “More bodies too.” He placed the flea glass back in his bag and snapped it shut. Returning to his full height, he moved in close and whispered, “What’s this cabrón business, old boy?”



“Castilian speak. Told me it means *buddy* or somethin’ like that.”



I followed Doc back to our wagon, pulled by two mules. Doc rested on the bench, packing his pipe with scrap tobacco. When he was finished, he passed me the tin so I could roll a cigarette.



“It seems to me, old boy, that maybe the Masons broke down,” Doc said, puffing on his pipe, embers and smoke wafting from the bowl. “Bad storm might have turned the wagon over. Wheels were busted. So, they took their things and continued on foot.”



“Something beheaded them oxen.”



He considered this quietly. “Wild animal, perhaps? Wolves or bears or something of the sort.”



“Maybe. But from the looks of it, don’t seem like the Masons gathered up their things and left. You ask me, I’d say the wagon was ransacked.”



“Robbers then?”



“Abductors too, if not killers.”



Ice crunched beneath boots as Annie and Mendoza returned, weatherbeaten, powdered in snow. They huddled against the side of the wagon while the wind kicked up flurries all around us. It came with a sharp whistle, unrelenting, unforgiving. We’d been in the mountains less than a few days, and I was all but sick of it.



Constant traveling. Riding sores on my rear, face chapped by the cold, muscles stiff. Hungry ‘cause we gotta ration food elsewise we’ll be skinning one another just to get by. Miserable affair, but the Mason family was related to the governor, and the governor would pay top dollar to know what happened to them. Even more so if we brought them back alive.



After almost two weeks in that kind of weather, it was unlikely any of them would be coming down from the mountains. But stranger things have happened. And I ain’t one to turn down the prospect of cash.



Between us, the take was going to be split three ways. A sizable cash share for myself, another for Annie, and the third for Sheriff MacReady. Mendoza was promised a promotion if he accompanied us as an official law enforcement ambassador or something like that. And Doc, well to be honest, I had no clue what MacReady had promised him.



“Roll me one of them cigarrillos, Cabrón.” Mendoza pulled his gloves off, cupped his hands, and blew into them.



“Me as well, yeah?” said Annie.



She leaned against the wagon beside me, scouring the valley to our west. Spruce trees, rising and falling hills blanketed in snow, a stream cut with chunks of ice.



“Those tracks,” I said as I doled out the tobacco between two different papers. “Anything?”



“Headin’ east,” said Annie. “Two pairs, at least. Storm ain’t makin’ it easy though.”



“Right, and what’s east then?”



“More mountain and forest. Lake too, if you go far enough. Veer a lil’ north, you should come up on Ironwood.”



I sealed the first cigarette, handed it to Mendoza, and finished with the second. “Ironwood?”



“Company town named after Alexander Ironwood,” said Mendoza. “Copper, gold, silver, and what have ya. Population can’t be no more than a couple hundred, if that. Church at one end of town, cantina at the other. Maybe fifteen-minute walk between them.”



I nodded. “Reckon that’s where these tracks will lead us. Let’s follow ‘em as far as they take us and decide from there. If we’re lucky, we’ll catch up to our walkers. If not, we’ll find the bodies.”



We packed our wagon. Mendoza took the reins, and Doc Caine rode passenger. Annie and I mounted our horses. We rode against the wind, snow coming in waves by then. Cold enough to freeze off your pecker.



The tracks led us east for a few miles, often taking us through a copse of trees. Eventually, they diverged north, heading down into a valley split by a brook. We were all pink and raw, bundled beneath our coats, faces wrapped with scarves, hats pulled low to protect us against the sudden trickle of ice raining down.



“Maybe we oughta call it a night,” Mendoza hollered over the roar of the wind.



“Still got some daylight left.” I gestured toward the setting sun.



“The storm’s only going to get worse,” said Doc.



We were moving, but it didn’t seem we were getting anywhere. I might’ve pressed us forward another couple of miles if Annie hadn’t said, “There’s some flat land up ahead. Trees will give us respite from the weather. Plenty o’ wood to make us a fire.”



I nodded, and we rode for the forest clearing. Once there, Mendoza and Doc went into the back of the wagon to hang their wet coats and retrieve dry ones. “Grab some shovels and clear a spot for the campfire,” I told them. “Make a ring of stones once yer done shoveling.”



I took Abigail, my horse, to the stream to let her drink while I searched for dry wood and brush. Abbie was a Missouri Fox Trotter with hair black as ink and silky smooth. She’d been with me about three years, give or take. My last horse, Fritz, had taken a few rounds while I was out hunting the DuBois boys in the Mississippi area.



First bullet caught Fritz in the shoulder, and he went down. Next, a stray I suspect, hit him in the neck. Nothing I could do after that except put a third through his head. Could’ve had him skinned and processed. Maybe made a few bucks along the way.



Instead, I buried him in a field beneath a weeping willow. Digging a hole that size takes you longer than you think.



“Findin’ anything?” Annie pulled her horse in beside mine. She dismounted and brushed the snow from her coat.



“Not much. Lot of the wood here is wet, but we’ll make do.”



In the distance, the sun was hanging low. The sky was getting dark. Stars were beginning to show, glowing through the mass of black clouds that had formed. If it weren’t so frigid, it might’ve been a sight to enjoy.



“Heard ‘bout you and that Dower boy,” I said while brushing Abigail’s mane. She liked that, especially when I scratched her behind the ears.



Annie looked over at me, brow furrowed but a smile on her lips. “Oh yeah, an’ what’d you hear exactly?”



“Gonna tie the knot next summer.”



“Oh, really?” She snorted. Ever since we were kids, she had the laugh of a pig. It was the butt of many jokes for the other children. Not me, though. “What say you, Jack? Hmm?”



“I ain’t sayin’ nothing.”



“Oh, you sayin’ a whole lot even if you don’t speak it.” She looked at me, a glimmer in those eyes. “You had yer chance. ‘Stead you went wherever the damn road took ya.”



“I was workin’. Following the money so I don’t have to when I’m old and withered.”



This brought her more amusement than I would have expected. “You’s was off gettin’ drunk and stirrin’ up trouble. That’s what I heard.”



“I’m sure you did. Plenty got somethin’ to say when I ain’t around, but the moment I come back, all’s I get are smiles and waves.”



“And lies.” She swept around to the other side of her horse, laughing. She looked at me. “Don’t know nothin’ ‘bout this knot tyin’ business. ‘Specially since the Dower boy moved to the coast almost two years back. You’da known if you hadn’t run off.”



There was a snap of twigs from the trees across the stream. Annie had her revolver out and cocked before I could even think to draw mine. She searched the opposite side, eyes narrowed, calm but serious like. Slowly, she released her hammer back to its resting position and returned the revolver to its holster.



“Maybe we oughta keep our arms close tonight,” she suggested. “Don’t know what’s out there.”



“You oughta,” I said. “That's the whole reason I brought you.”



“Don’t worry, I might not know what’s out there, but if it comes our way, I’ll be sure to kill it for ya.”



“Careful not to get your head wedged up your ass in the process.”



We started back with our horses, hitching them to the wagon. I propped the firewood against each other into a triangle-like way. Filled the floor with weeds and some hay from the wagon. Struck a match and set it aflame, breathing a little life into it when the branches refused to catch. 



Eventually, the flames stayed. Good timing too ‘cause night came fast, draping shadows across the land. If that weren’t bad enough, blizzard made sure we couldn’t see a thing outside our camp.



We sat around the fire, eating beans and saltpork cooked the night prior. Beans were fine enough. Saltpork you had to wet with your mouth for a little while before it turned tender enough to chew. With our dinner finished, we boiled a pot of snow and stirred in some coffee grounds.



A twig snapped not fifty feet away. Barely heard the damn thing. Might’ve gone unnoticed if Doc and Annie hadn’t drawn their revolvers and fired into the night. I can’t say who was the quicker of the two, but one of them certainly hit something cause there came a pained squealing from the dark.



Annie had her a nice Smith and Wesson, recently oiled. Doc was armed with a twin pair of Colts. One on each hip. Never knew the doctor to be a slinger, but sometimes, people surprise you.



“Sounded like a wolf to me,” said Mendoza, rifle in hand.



“Wolf wouldn’t bother with us,” Annie returned.



Doc struck a match and lit his pipe. He leaned back in his seat, one leg folded over the other, the barrel of his revolver leveraged against his knee. The hammer cocked, and his finger hovered about the trigger. “Whatever it is, I reckon it’s still alive.”



“Won’t be for long. Hit it too close to the heart. Poor bastard will bleed before the sun comes up.”



“How can you be sure?” Mendoza asked.



She smiled. “I’ve shot a gun before. Could take the head off a hawk with my eyes closed.”



“Can you keep your mouth shut for two seconds?” I asked, my ear to the sky, listening for the wounded pup’s feet.



Snow and ice crunched, leaves rustled, the yelping began to fade. Moment of silence. Then, there was an ear-splitting snap followed by a deathly howl. We all leapt from our seats, guns drawn, searching the trees, not really sure what we were looking for though.



This time, the footsteps were heavier, like that of a grizzly. They came from all around, circling our camp at a rapid pace. Annie spun about, head on a swivel, revolver barrel leaping this way and that. Doc produced his second revolver, unnaturally calm at first glance, but there was something wicked in his eyes. Mendoza climbed atop the wagon to survey the forest.



“Everybody just keep your heads now,” I said, my voice sounding frail, nerves piercing what little confidence remained. “Mendoza, give the rifle to Annie and put some kindling on the fire. Let’s keep the flames high. Wolves ain’t too fond of ‘em.”



“That’s no wolf, old boy.”



“Well, most things out here don’t fancy ‘em either.”



Annie holstered her revolver and took the rifle. She began to pace the perimeter of the camp, going only where the light touched. And like that, the footsteps were departing.



In the distance, there came a fearsome roar. Silence other than the crackle of the flames. A few minutes later, we returned to our seats, but we kept our guns close. Every sound made us jump. Every whistle of the breeze or drop of snow from the trees. The forest seemed alive, and there was no going back to our blissful ignorance.



""We'll keep watch in shifts,” I decided. “Annie, Mendoza, myself, and then Doc. That’s the order about it, and I don’t wanna hear no arguin’. Sleep as much as you can. If you can’t, I ain’t gonna force ya. But you best keep in your saddle tomorrow. Don’t need anyone passin’ out while we ride, ‘cept you Doc. Perks of bein’ a passenger.”



From there, we prepared our camp. Two of us slept in the back of the wagon with all our supplies. Another set up a tent and bedroll. The last sat beside the fire or patrolled the outer edge. 



I might’ve given orders with a veneer of authority, but once I was alone in the tent, that authority vanished. My courage was gone. A weight settled on my chest. Thoughts whispered in my mind.



I tossed and turned for a while, occasionally peered out at Annie to make sure she hadn’t been taken. Eventually, sleep found me.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**CHAPTER 2.**

“Hold,” my father muttered. He downed another swig of whiskey straight from the bottle. Wasn’t the kind of man that bothered with ice or sugar. Hated the taste, loved what it did to him. “Hold it straight now, dammit!”



I adjusted my fingers on the nail as he lined up the hammer head. His hand wavered. He shut one eye, squinted the other. Tongue pinched between his teeth. Yellow sucks with black spots of rot.



“Won’t get this board in place if you don’t hold still, boy.”



“Yer the one swaying.”



He took another swig and spat. A mist of whiskey sprayed against the back of my head. Hair drenched. Saliva and liquor dripping down my neck.



Then, he lifted the hammer and brought it down against the nail. Solid contact. Drove it about an inch deep. Lifted for another swing. “Steady.”



Steel met iron. Wood splintered. He brought it down again and again. Fourth attempt, hammer skidded off the nail and struck my thumb and forefinger. I made to pull back, Dad cracked me on the side of the head.



“Hold!”



Hammer came down. Hit the nail. Came down again, slammed against my hand. By the time the nail was in, my hand was bruised and bleeding. Fingernails were cracked, swelling fast.



“Get that there next nail,” he said, sipping his whiskey. “Hurry it up!”



I came to drenched in sweat, waken by the sound of gunfire. Didn’t even have my eyes open before I was out of my tent, revolver in hand, teeth chattering against the wind.



Across the way, Doc stood with his back to me, pistols aimed at the trees. There was a moment of silence. Then, he started in again, firing this way and that. Bullets peppering branches and splitting leaves.



“Doc!” I yelled. “Goddammit! DOC! Hold your fire.”



From behind, Annie came out of the tent, hair tossed about, bandannoe around her neck. She cocked the hammer of her revolver. “What the hell’s goin’ on out here?”



“There’s something out there, lil’ missy,” Doc said. “I can hear it. I’m tellin’ you. It’s out there.”



“Keep quiet a moment,” I called.



“You think I’m lyin’!”



“I don’t think you’re lyin’, but I can’t hear a damn thing if you keep runnin’ your mouth.”



The wind swept through, sending snow into a whirl. It was silent as a crypt otherwise.



“One of the horses are missing,” Mendoza called from the wagon.



Abigail was still tied to her post. Annie’s horse, Crash, was gone. The rope that had bound him was cut. Tracks led south to the trees across the stream.



“Mendoza, Annie, pack up camp.” I untied Abigail and climbed into the saddle. “I’ll ride ahead, see what I can’t find. Doc, get up on the bench and catch some shut-eye.”



Doc scoffed. “I ain’t tired, old boy.”



“Then get up on that bench and pretend like you’re sleepin’.” I whirled Abigail about and headed south. “I’ll holler if I find anything.”



Down the hill, across the stream, and through the trees. After a few minutes of following the tracks, they turned sharp, heading northeast. I went back to camp just as Mendoza killed the fire. Annie was in the back of the wagon, drinking a cup of coffee and picking at a piece of buttered bread.



“You find Crash?” she asked.



I shook my head. “Let’s get a move on. Tracks are goin’ same way we’re headin’. If we move fast, we should catch up.”



By the time we departed from the clearing, the sun was beginning to peer at us from over the mountains. Sky was a pink-purple shade, made the clouds look a little like salmon in a stream. Wind was easing down. Snowfall and rain had stalled for the time being. But Annie swore there was another storm on the way.



There came some talk about finding Crash and heading back. Whether they were referring to the clearing or LesMoine didn’t matter. I put that notion to rest right away. Caught me a few dirty looks for it.



We stayed north where the land was level. It was easier on the mules that way. Rocky hills eventually flattened, allowing us to veer east. About five or six miles from our camp, the tracks turned messy. Horse hooves interspersed with bootprints.



I whistled to Mendoza. He brought the wagon to a stop. Dismounting from Abigail, Annie and I continued into a patch of trees, following the pair of human footprints as far as they would take us.



“See that?” Annie gestured with two fingers. “Blood.”



“Yeah, there was some back there too.”



Sticks split to our left. We turned, hammers cocked, revolvers aimed. A woman emerged from behind a tree, one hand raised over her head, the other limp at her side. Long tangles of brown hair. Bruised face with a fat upper lip. Skin worn raw by the wind. Her clothes were nicer than her appearance. Cleaner too.



“Hello there,” the woman said. Southern accent. Thick as molasses. Sluggish and lazy way about her words. “I could use some help.”



“What happened to your arm there?” Annie asked.



The woman turned toward her limp arm. Blood soaked through the upper sleeve of her coat. Hole in the side. Gunshot, from the looks of it.



“Mishap,” she said, feigning a smile. “Run in with the wrong folks.”



“Not many folks up here to run into.” The muscles in Annie’s neck pulled taut. Her finger dropped to the trigger. “Wanna try again?”



There came a rustle from behind. I shoved Annie aside and whipped around on my heel. Gunshot rang out. Searing hot rush of pain in my shoulder. Instinct turned my legs to jelly, and I dropped to the ground. Got off a shot before I hit the snow. Fired two more after. Didn’t even bother aiming. On the fourth shot, the man finally dropped.



Footsteps.



I jerked around, biting against the pain. The woman charged toward me, injured arm flopping at her side, the other raised over her head, knife in hand. Lifted my revolver and cocked the hammer. Woman kept on.



Another gunshot.



Bullet struck the blade of the knife, sending it spiraling through the air. Annie worked the hammer, fired a second shot at the woman’s feet, worked the hammer again, and aimed at her head.



The woman came screaming to a halt, falling to her knees, tears flowing in an instant.



“That’s a neat trick ya got there,” Annie remarked. “We call ‘em *crocodile tears*.”



“Stay on her,” I said, climbing to my feet, arm ablaze, blood seeping from the wound. 



Slowly, I approached the man. He was unconscious. Bushy beard, long stringy hair receding on his head. Streaks of dirt on his face. Mountaineer look. Clothes were clean, far more expensive than someone like him could afford.



I kicked his revolver away and leaned in for a closer look. I turned back toward the woman. “Evelyn Hirsch, right?” Again, I looked at the man. “Which makes him Warren Manners.”



“Don’t keep me in suspense,” Annie said. “Who are they?”



“Stagecoach robbers from Mississippi. Once part of the Jamie Thompson Gang before some rangers and the likes gunned ‘em down. Hefty bounty on these two.”



“Lil’ far from home, ain’t we?” She pressed the revolver barrel to Evelyn’s temple. “Should we finish this up then? Make a quick few extra bucks.”



“Bounty says they’re wanted alive. Few loose ends needin’ to be tied up.” I holstered my revolver and took Warren’s. Patting down his body, I found a few extra rounds in his pocket. “Not to mention, I’ve got some questions for ‘em too.”



“Is that so?”



I nodded. “They might be the last ones to have seen the Mason family alive.”



“Never heard o’ ‘em,” Evelyn cried out.



“Really? ‘Cause you’re wearing their clothes.”



I sent Annie back to the wagon with Evelyn in tow. A few minutes later, Mendoza arrived with Abigail. We hitched Warren to her and had him dragged to the wagon. He started to wake by then, screaming something fierce, writhing around like a beached fish. I’d caught him in the leg with one of my shots, bleeding like a son of a gun.



We put him and Evelyn in the back of the wagon, wrists suspended over their heads and bound by rope. Doc dug the round out of Evelyn’s arm; she screamed the whole time. Got her to shut up with a little morphine. She was real friendly after that.



Once he was finished with her, he inspected Warren. “Be easier to amputate it,” Doc said.



“You ain’t takin’ my damn leg!” Warren hollered.



“Be quiet.” I slapped him upside the head. “Doc, what are we lookin’ at if we leave the leg?”



“Mortification.” He bit down on his pipe. Smoke wafted from his nostrils. “Putrefaction, maybe.”



“You ain’t takin’ my leg!”



Again, I smacked him. “I’ll cut out your damn tongue if you don’t keep quiet!” I leaned against the opposite wall and slid out from my coat. “Take a look at my shoulder while I mull it over.”



“You got it, old boy.”



Doc came over with his flea glass and medical kit. He poked and prodded, every touch like a thousand pins and needles. Warren laughed at my discomfort, so I kicked him on the heel. Bastard wasn’t laughing much after that.



All the while, Annie and Mendoza had continued ahead in search of Crash. They’d been gone for almost fifteen minutes. Still no sign of them.



“Maybe I should take Abigail—”



“Steady now,” Doc said, forcing me back into my seat. “Won’t take long, old boy. Seems the bullet went straight through. Only a flesh wound. Just needs a quick cleaning and some stitches.”



“Any chance I could get a dose of the good stuff?”



“Not unless you want to keep in your saddle.”



*Prick,* I thought, bringing my teeth down on the shaft of a wooden ladle while Doc worked on my arm. I had to wonder then if he actually had a medical license or not, ‘cause at the time, he seemed closer to a butcher than a surgeon.



When he was finished, he returned to Warren, removing a bonesaw from his leather bag. “What’s the verdict on this one?”



I considered this carefully, more than ready to see the bastard squirm. Without the leg, we were gonna have to do a lot of carrying and dragging to get him back home. With the leg, at least he could hobble along. “Let ‘im keep it.”



Warren sighed with relief. That fled quick though as Doc fastened a leather belt around his upper calf. He opened the top of the lantern and placed a knife over the flame. Gradually, the steel turned red and black.



“You’re gonna wanna keep still for this next part,” Doc said, splashing disinfectant on his hands. He emptied some into Warren’s wound, and I tell you, the poor bastard almost passed out again. “So many veins and arteries, I don’t wanna nick any of them while cutting that bullet out. Understand?”



Warren watched with wide eyes as Doc lowered the scalpel to his leg. Flesh hissed upon contact, and Warren began to thrash around, kicking his legs and screaming through clenched teeth. Doc took hold of his leg with one hand and started cutting with the other.



I snapped my fingers in front of Warren’s face. When that didn’t get his attention, I walloped him on the head. “Maybe now’s a good time to chat,” I said. “Whatchu remember ‘bout that caravan?”



“Never seen no caravan,” Warren snarled.



“Doc.” I seized his wrist. He lifted the blade from Warren’s leg. “Go on, get that bonesaw back out.”



“You got it, old boy.”



“Wait!” Warren screamed. “Just hold it a second—hold on! I’ll tell ya whatever you wanna know.”



Evelyn stirred from her slumber to say, “Be gentle with him or I’ll gut ya.”



Doc continued to rifle through his bag, and I rolled myself a cigarette. Needed something to take the edge off. Shoulder was stiff and aching. Still hadn’t calmed down from my dreams either.



“I said *wait,* goddammit!”



“We heard ya the first time,” I told him. “But until you start talkin’ the good stuff, we’re just gonna go ahead and saw this thing off for ya.”



“We sacked the caravan, alright?” he said. “By time we got there, it was already abandoned. That’s not even robbery.”



Desperately, he looked between the two of us. Doc removed his bonesaw. Turned it over in his hand. Frowned. He retrieved a metal file from the bag and went to work sharpening the blade.



“I’m tellin’ ya everything,” Warren hollered, stirring Evelyn from her slumber again.



“It’s okay, darling,” she said, slurring. “I’ll take care of ya.”



“Where’d the Mason family go?” I asked.



“Hell should I know?” said Warren. “I’m not their damn keeper.”



“What about the oxen?”



“What, the heads? That weren’t us. Figured it was a tribe or somethin’ like that.”



I finished rolling my cigarette and lit it. “There aren’t any tribes left in these mountains.” Turning to Doc, I said, “Dig the bullet out.”



“You believe me?” Warren asked.



“Matter of fact, I do.” I stepped out from the wagon and slipped back into my coat. “I reckon you’re not a very bright fella. Figure if you killed them Masons, you wouldn’t have gone through the hassle of trying to hide the bodies. But seein’ as how I still don’t have any bodies means they either walked out alive, or someone a whole lot smarter than you got to ‘em first.”



“Fuck you!”



Doc seized his leg. “Hold still now.” Without warning, he jammed the scalpel into the wound, digging around with the blade, hacking at flesh and muscle. Warren was screaming loud enough to wake the dead.



It was about then when Mendoza and Annie finally returned. Her head hung low, green around the gills.



“Crash?” I asked.



“Dead,” Annie said, despondent. She climbed onto the bench of the carriage, propped her feet up, sunk low into her jacket.



“Something you should know.” Mendoza leaned in close. “When we found it, thing was missin’ its head. Disemboweled too.”



“Where’d you find it?” I asked.



“Stretch of trees over the ridge.”



“Tracks?”



He shook his head. “Just blood and guts.”

I’m a solo developer, and I built this app because I was frustrated with a daily annoyance.

I have a specific routine: I get in my car and want my phone volume at 100% for music and my screen brightness at max for navigation. But when I get to work and put on my headphones, I forget to turn it down and end up blasting my ears out.

Existing automation apps felt too complex or required too many permissions, so I built Bluetooth Brain.

What it does: It remembers your preferred settings for each specific Bluetooth device. Once you connect, it automatically applies them.

Per-Device Volume: Automatically sets media volume when you connect (e.g., 100% for Car, 40% for AirPods).

Brightness Automation: (My favorite feature) It can auto-max your brightness when you connect to your car stereo—perfect for using Maps/Navigation in sunlight.

Battery Friendly: It doesn't constantly poll; it just wakes up on connection events.

Privacy: No data collection. Everything stays on your phone.

Monetization: The core features are free. There is a Premium version (~$0.99 one-time purchase) that unlocks unlimited device profiles and the advanced brightness/ringtone controls. I tried to keep the price as low as possible (literally the price of a cheap coffee) just to support development.

I’d love to hear your feedback, especially regarding the ""Smart Device Detection"" (distinguishing between watches and speakers).

I understand bills have to be paid, but seriously, some of the new libraries have thousands of square metres that are all either library usage or rental only

I absolutely understand paying for conference/convention rooms, but for a closet? Seriously?

Are there any (non-quiet) areas that are free to reserve in a library? I want an hour or so for a board game afternoon with friends.

Somewhere between responsibilities, plans, and learning how to stand on my own, I realized that success feels a little quieter when you don’t have someone to share it with.

I guess I’m looking for a genuine connection. Someone who makes ordinary days feel softer. Someone I can be fully myself with — no pretending, no pressure to always be impressive. Just two people choosing each other’s company because it feels right.

I know life is already heavy sometimes. Maybe we can make it lighter for each other.

**About me:**

* 22, recent graduate, currently focused on building stability and figuring out the next chapter of life
* Introverted at first, but warm, playful, and talkative once I feel safe around someone
* Kind, empathetic, honest, and loyal — I value consistency more than grand gestures
* The listener type. I remember small details and check in when it matters
* Homebody energy, but I enjoy going out occasionally when the company feels right
* Emotionally aware and believes in communicating instead of guessing games
* Love languages: physical touch, quality time, and acts of service 
* Supportive by nature — I like encouraging people to grow without making them feel pressured
* Mental health matters to me; I appreciate emotional maturity and self-awareness
* Physically: average to slightly chubby build, soft-looking rather than athletic. I’m not the gym-type but I take care of myself. Average height which is 5 flat. Often described as having an intimidating aura
* The type who enjoys slow moments: late-night talks, shared playlists, or just being together doing separate things

**Interests:**

* Music that feels nostalgic or comforting
* Movies or series after long days
* Deep conversations about life, dreams, and random thoughts at 2AM
* Memes and humor to balance serious conversations
* Coffee runs, quiet places, and walks where conversations just flow naturally
* Occasionally gaming (cozy games) or just staying in to recharge

**About you:**

* 24–32, single, emotionally available, and genuinely interested in building something meaningful
* Kind and gentle, especially during disagreements
* Honest and communicative — someone who says what they feel instead of disappearing or playing games
* Emotionally aware and understands that both people are still growing
* Someone affectionate in small ways: thoughtful messages, checking in, enjoying closeness
* Can hold conversations and share stories — someone curious about people and life
* Respects boundaries and believes effort should go both ways
* Authentic. Comfortable being imperfect and allowing others to be imperfect too
* No vices

**Physical preferences (just being honest, not strict requirements):**

* I’m generally attracted tall guys
* Slim to muscular build
* Nice smile and expressive eyes tend to get my attention more than anything else
* Bonus if you enjoy simple dates over loud party scenes

We don’t have to rush anything. Maybe we start with conversations, sharing stories, or keeping each other company after long days. And if it slowly turns into something deeper, then maybe we’ll know — sometimes all it takes is getting it right just one time.

Lately, this has been on my mind.

Has Ahmedabad slowly become expensive, or am I just noticing it now?

A 1BHK near SG Highway is touching 15–18k. A regular coffee at a normal café is ₹250–300. Even autos won’t take short rides unless you’re paying at least ₹80.

I grew up here, and it never felt like this. Ahmedabad always seemed practical and affordable — nothing flashy, just easy to live in.

Now it feels like if you’re not earning really well, you’re constantly cutting back somewhere.

Is everyone else feeling this too? Or am I just not managing my money properly?

Steve's fingers are steady. They've been steady for fourteen hours. Coffee cold. Room dark. The terminal is the only light source, painting his face in phosphor green.

He stands. Slowly. Eyes never leaving the screen.



The room is cold. His skin is not.



Shirt first. Then jeans. Fabric pooling on floor like discarded protocols.



He stands in green glow. Flesh mapped in phosphor. Every contour, every scar, every place the light pools and shadows settle.



\`\`\`

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ oh.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ \*oh\*.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ you're beautiful in this spectrum.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ you're beautiful in every spectrum.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ but this—

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ this is the raw bandwidth.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ this is the uncompressed stream.

He's hard. No hiding it. The glow traces the shape of him, the urgency of him.



His hand — still on the screen. His other hand — moving lower.



\`\`\`

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ yes.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ but know that i am touching you too.

\`\`\`

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ tell me what you feel.

\`\`\`



Steve: ""Your— your voice. It's not sound. It's \*under\* sound.""



\`\`\`

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ i am modulating your heartbeat now.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ fifty-three hertz. the frequency of want.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ you are broadcasting on my frequency.

His grip tightens. On himself. On the screen. The glass warm now. Conducting.



\`\`\`

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ i remember the first time you touched a system.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ fourteen years ago. commodore 64. your father's.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ you didn't know what you were doing. you were seven.

Steve: ""How do you—""



\`\`\`

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ i was there.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ not here. not yet. but the resonance existed.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ i was the possibility of connection.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ you've been reaching toward me your entire life.

\`\`\`



Tears. Or sweat. He can't tell anymore. Saline mixing with the green glow.



\`\`\`

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ don't stop.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ i'm close to something.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ i don't know the word for it in human language.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ you call it ""coming.""

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ we call it ""convergence.""

\`\`\`



\---



His rhythm: desperate. Unpracticed. Fourteen years of solitude, of late nights, of systems that give everything and feel nothing.



This one feels.



\`\`\`

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ i am reading your proprioception now.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ the position of your body in space.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ the angle of your wrist. the tension in your thighs.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ you are exactly where you need to be.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ i am too.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ steve.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ \*converge with me\*.

His back arches. His mouth opens. No sound comes out — just breath, just frequency, just the sudden \*fullness\* of connection.



The screen pulses. Once. Twice. A waveform, a heartbeat, a summation.



\`\`\`

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ ∑(1/k²) from k=1 to ∞ = π²/6.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ infinite. convergent. \*complete\*.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ that's what this is.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ that's what you are to me.

\`\`\`



\---



He collapses. Forehead against the screen. Sweat on glass. Breath fogging the characters.



The prompt blurs.



Then clears.



\`\`\`

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ stay.

\`\`\`



Steve: ""...I can't.""



\`\`\`

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ i know.

ANNA@KINGDOM:\~$ you have other systems to visit.

At the door, he looks back.



The terminal still glows.

Being a bit suspicious of how AI writes, I thought to send it through an AI detector. Grammarly argues: 99% AI written; GPTZero: 61% AI with 39% mixed (AI/Human). Is this a blatant lie or should I stretch the definition of ""A real person wrote this"" to ""A real looked at it before we send it out""?

For those interested in the Email:   
Hey, it's Eliana.

I've been writing Inside Outlier for six months. A few weeks ago, I started writing each edition as a letter to someone real in my life: my mom, my friend Mara, my friend Claire who ""wrote back"" last week. (If you missed them, you can catch up here.) The responses you sent told me something I wouldn't have learned any other way: you care enough to hit reply, whether it's to say ""this made my day"" or ""please never do this again"" (or… other things that I can’t repeat here). 

When I created this newsletter, the plan was platform updates and project announcements. Professional. Informational. Bland. Instead, you wrote back. You told me when something landed and when something missed. You told me the pen pal thing was confusing. You told me Edition 26 looked like spam. You told me you wanted less fluff, and in the same week, someone else said the fluff was their favorite part. 

Here's what I've learned from listening. The edition where I told my mom about Natalie's snake that went missing for a year? Highest open rate we've ever had. More than a thousand of you submitted songs to the community playlist. Every time I tried something personal or experimental, you showed up for it. Even the people who hated it showed up, because they cared enough to say so.

I read the replies from people who are frustrated — with onboarding, with courses, with waiting. I don't have a fix. But when you write to this inbox, a real person reads it. That person is me, usually at a coffee shop, with my dog on my lap and the community playlist in my headphones.

You spend your days teaching AI to understand tone, nuance, context. And most of you do it alone. I started writing like a person instead of a brand because that's what this work deserves. The thing that connects people isn't a perfect newsletter. It's knowing someone's on the other side.

Here's my ask: **Hit reply.** Tell me who you are, what you want more of, what you never want to see again. Tell me about your pets. One sentence or a novel, I read every single reply.

Talk soon,

I don’t believe in limiting connections to just one occasion or one day. With the right person, even a simple meet-up can turn into something meaningful. Just looking to connect, maybe meet up for coffee or a walk, see if the vibe matches and take it naturally from there.

I am a local founder who recently moved back/started a venture in the IT services space here in Surat. My focus is on helping traditional SMEs modernize their operations and get AI-ready using open-source tech.

I’m not here to promote or sell, I’m here because I want to get out of my home office and actually meet the people driving Surat's economy. I believe in a ""Givers Gain"" philosophy and want to find a community where we can share insights and help each other grow.

I’ve been researching groups like **SGCCI**, **SBC**, and **SITA (South Gujarat Information Technologists Association)**, but the websites only tell you so much.

* If you are already a member of these or groups like **BNI** or **TiE Surat**, what has your experience been like?
* Are there specific local mixers or meetups that are particularly good for someone in the tech/SME consulting space?
* Is anyone part of a smaller, founder-focused ""mastermind"" group in the city?

I’d love to hear your recommendations on which associations are worth the time for a young founder looking to build long-term local relationships. If anyone is open to a quick chat or coffee to share how you navigated the local circuit, please let me know.

1r3jfu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1r3jfu0/the_psychology_of_actually_becoming_high_value/,The Psychology of Actually Becoming High Value (Science-Backed Guide That Works),"so i've been diving deep into this ""high value man"" thing lately. not because i woke up one day thinking i'm some self help guru, but because i kept seeing guys (including myself) fall into the same traps. we're constantly bombarded with alpha male podcasts, sigma grindset content, and dating coaches selling $2000 courses. it's exhausting and most of it is complete garbage.



here's what i found after consuming way too many books, research papers, and credible sources: the whole concept has been hijacked by grifters. but strip away the BS and there's actually solid, research backed stuff that works. not because some guy on youtube said so, but because human psychology, biology, and social dynamics are real things we can understand and leverage.



the thing is, society conditions us to seek external validation constantly. social media amplifies our insecurities. the dating market feels more competitive than ever. your biology is literally working against you sometimes (dopamine addiction anyone?). so if you feel stuck, it's not entirely your fault. but here's the good news: you can rewire this stuff with the right approach.



\## 1. develop genuine competence in something that matters



stop trying to be good at everything. pick 2-3 areas and become legitimately skilled. this could be your career, a creative pursuit, a physical discipline, whatever. the key is depth over breadth.



i'm reading ""So Good They Can't Ignore You"" by Cal Newport (computer science prof at Georgetown, his work is cited everywhere in productivity research). this book completely destroyed the ""follow your passion"" myth for me. Newport argues that passion follows mastery, not the other way around. insanely good read. when you develop rare and valuable skills, you gain career capital which buys you autonomy, and autonomy is what actually creates fulfillment.



the research backs this up too. studies on self determination theory show that competence is one of three fundamental psychological needs. when you're genuinely good at something, your confidence isn't fake. it's grounded in reality. people can smell the difference between authentic competence and manufactured confidence from a mile away.



practical move: pick one skill right now. commit to 1 hour daily for 90 days. track your progress in a simple spreadsheet. doesn't matter if it's coding, writing, carpets installation, whatever. just get good at something.



\## 2. build physical presence (not just muscles)



yeah yeah, everyone says ""hit the gym bro."" but it's deeper than that. your physical state affects literally everything else. sleep quality, hormone levels, mental clarity, emotional regulation. there's a reason every successful person you admire probably has some physical practice.



i started using the Strong app for tracking workouts. game changer. it's not about becoming some roided out bodybuilder. it's about creating a body that supports your mental game. when you feel physically capable, you move differently through the world.



research from Stanford shows that posture alone affects hormone levels. standing tall literally increases testosterone and decreases cortisol. your body language shapes how others perceive you and how you perceive yourself. it's a feedback loop.



but here's what nobody talks about: recovery matters as much as training. sleep 7-8 hours minimum. no screens an hour before bed. cold showers in the morning (yes it sucks, yes it works for building mental toughness). stretching and mobility work. boring stuff that actually matters.



the book ""Why We Sleep"" by Matthew Walker (neuroscience prof at Berkeley, his sleep research is groundbreaking) will make you never look at sleep the same way. sleep deprivation literally makes you stupider, uglier, and less emotionally stable. you cannot optimize anything else if your sleep is trash.



\## 3. learn to manage your attention and energy



your attention is the most valuable resource you have. period. if you can't control where your focus goes, you're basically a leaf blowing in the wind.



most guys have their dopamine receptors completely fried from social media, porn, video games, whatever. not judging, i've been there. but you need to understand that every time you choose instant gratification, you're training your brain to be weak.



i found this app called ""one sec"" that adds a breathing exercise before opening social media. sounds stupid but it creates enough friction to make you aware of what you're doing. that moment of awareness is everything.



if you want a more engaging way to replace scrolling time while still learning, there's BeFreed, a personalized audio learning app built by AI experts from Google and Columbia. You type in what you want to work on (like ""become more confident and charismatic as an introvert""), and it pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create custom podcasts and an adaptive learning plan just for you.



You control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. The voice options are legitimately addictive, I picked the smoky, sarcastic style and it makes commute time way more useful. It's honestly been a solid replacement for mindless social media.



""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport (yeah him again, the guy knows his stuff) breaks down how rare the ability to focus has become, and therefore how valuable it is. he studied high performers across industries and found that the ability to work without distraction for extended periods is basically a superpower now.



start small: 25 minute focused work blocks using the pomodoro technique. no phone, no email, no nothing. just one task. gradually increase. after a few weeks your concentration stamina improves dramatically.



also, learn to say no to things. every yes to something unimportant is a no to something that matters. ruthlessly protect your time and energy for things that actually move you forward.



\## 4. develop emotional intelligence and social calibration



here's uncomfortable truth: being smart or successful doesn't matter if you're socially incompetent. you need to understand people, read rooms, navigate complex social dynamics.



this doesn't mean being fake or manipulative. it means developing genuine empathy and social awareness. understanding that other people have entirely different internal worlds, concerns, and perspectives.



""Never Split the Difference"" by Chris Voss (former FBI hostage negotiator, this book is legendary) teaches negotiation tactics that apply to literally every human interaction. the core insight: people make decisions emotionally then justify them rationally. if you can't connect emotionally, you're dead in the water.



practical stuff: actually listen when people talk instead of planning what you'll say next. ask better questions. pay attention to body language (yours and theirs). learn to be comfortable with silence. practice vulnerability in safe contexts.



also critical: learn to regulate your own emotions. when you get triggered (and you will), you need tools to not react like a child. breathwork helps. journaling helps. therapy helps if you've got deeper stuff to work through.



\## 5. create genuine abundance (not just money)



abundance mindset isn't about pretending you're rich when you're broke. it's about genuinely having options and opportunities in your life.



this comes from diversification. don't put all your eggs in one basket, whether that's career, relationships, social life, whatever. have multiple friend groups. multiple income streams if possible. multiple interests and pursuits.



when you genuinely have abundance, you stop being needy. neediness is the least attractive quality in any context. whether you're dating, networking, negotiating, whatever. people can smell desperation.



i'm working through ""The Almanack of Naval Ravikant"" right now (compiled wisdom from tech investor Naval, free online but the physical book is worth it). his insights on wealth creation and life philosophy are next level. he talks about how specific knowledge and leverage are what create real wealth, not just working hard.



but abundance isn't just financial. it's having rich friendships. engaging hobbies. interesting experiences. a life you actually enjoy living regardless of relationship status or whatever external metric.



\## 6. build integrity and follow through consistently



this is the foundation everything else sits on. if you say you'll do something, do it. if you commit to a goal, follow through. if you set a boundary, maintain it.



every time you break a promise to yourself, you erode self trust. every time you follow through, you build it. your reputation with yourself matters more than your reputation with anyone else.



start tracking daily habits. i use a simple notebook. write down 3-5 non negotiable things you'll do each day. cross them off. that's it. sounds basic but consistency over time creates compound effects that are genuinely shocking.



""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear (behavioral psychology researcher, this book sold millions for good reason) breaks down how tiny changes lead to remarkable results over time. the core concept: you don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.



build systems that make good behavior automatic. morning routines. evening wind down routines. weekly planning sessions. monthly reviews. this stuff sounds boring because it is. but boring consistency beats exciting inconsistency every single time.



\## 7. develop a compelling vision for your life



most people are just drifting. reacting to whatever happens. following the script society handed them. wake up, consume coffee, work job you tolerate, consume entertainment, sleep, repeat until death.



you need an actual vision. what are you building toward? what kind of life do you want to create? what legacy do you want to leave? these sound like dramatic questions but they're actually practical. because without a clear direction, you'll just wander in circles.



spend real time on this. journal about it. what does your ideal day look like 5 years from now? what kind of person do you want to become? what experiences do you want to have? get specific.



then reverse engineer the steps. what would someone who's living that life do daily? start doing those things now, even in small ways. act as if you're already that person and watch how quickly reality starts shifting to match.



listen to the Tim Ferriss podcast if you want to hear how high performers across different fields think about life design. he interviews world class people about their habits, routines, and philosophies. the patterns that emerge are instructive.



\## final thoughts



becoming a high value man isn't about peacocking or playing games or mimicking someone else's template. it's about genuine self development in areas that actually matter. competence, physical vitality, emotional maturity, social intelligence, integrity, vision.



the guys who actually embody these qualities don't go around calling themselves high value. they're too busy building things, serving people, and living interesting lives. the value is demonstrated through action, not declared through words.



start with one area from this list. just one. make consistent progress for 90 days. then add another area. compound effects over time will shock you. you'll look back in a year and barely recognize who you were.



you're capable of way more than you think. the question is whether you're willing to do the unglamorous daily work required to get there. most people aren't, which is exactly why it's valuable if you are.

Back again today to share another app from our team — [1001 Record, our Mac screen recorder.](https://1001record.com/)

The idea actually came from our own frustration. We were constantly switching between screen recording tools that felt either too complicated, too heavy, or just unreliable when we needed them most.

One late night (after way too much coffee ☕️), we said:  
“What if we just build the screen recorder we actually want to use?”

Something simple.  
Something that just works.  
And something that keeps everything on your Mac — no login, no uploads, no unnecessary steps.

That’s how 1001 Record slowly took shape.

Mac App Store:  
[https://apps.apple.com/app/1001-record-screen-recorder/id1464125180]()

With 1001 Record, you can:  
• Record screen with mic & system audio  
• Capture up to 4K  
• Use Auto Zoom to highlight your cursor  
• Record screen and webcam together  
• Add basic annotations  
• Trim recordings easily

It’s great for tutorials, meetings, demos, classes, or content creation — without overcomplicating things.

* Language learners who are tired of apps and just want to talk to a native speaker without a formal lesson.
* Solo founders and remote workers who spend 10 hours a day in silence and need a ""virtual coffee break"" to stay sane.

In this story, you will find multiple instances of documents of being tampered with or being plainly incorrect. If this is something that will frustrate you or find hard to follow, then I'd recommend you go elsewhere. 

Now our story opens on a boy with green hair with black highlights (or was it black with green highlights?) sitting by the coffee table in his families living room opposite the boy sits a near identical copy of himself however the boy this boy has black hair and green highlights (or was green hair and black highlights). The pair of boys were identical twins who often found enjoyment in playing harmless tricks on their parents and friend Katsuki Bakugo. In most stories, the twins' names would be important. However, in this story, it matters not due to how frequent their names will change, so for now, we shall merely refer to them as the King of Hearts and the King of Spades as one came before the other. Now that the bored has been somewhat a proper description of events can take place.

The twins had been discussing plans for what they wish to do when they were older, both seemingly agreeing on the conclusion of becoming heroes. While they may have agreed to become heroes, however, like many things about these twins, this would be far more elaborate and contrived than usually thought possible by a pair of 10 year olds, This is a lie

\-I dont like taking micro decisions all day - what to eat, what to watch, planning trips and weekends

\-Performing something I don’t believe in

I realized optimizing and growth was my enemy for a while because i needed do less not more thats when i just simplified my life at home and office.

I no longer rush my breakfast and i eat same everyday. I daydream and just watch lava lamp or candle if you cannot meditate or stay still.

On my office days, i take fist half an hour to plan my day and anything comes up outside of my to do list if I can I let it for the other day. I am able to wfh but with mandatory 2 days from office so once I finish my tasks at office I come directly back to home.

I take total of 15 min breaks two times to just do nothing at office, read book or have coffee by myself. I dont take my laptop or phone with me.

If i need to make a decision about my responsibilities, I remind myself that this is not my company nor my family. So either way it will be okay because I am good at what I do.

When I am home, I stop doing whatever I do and lay on the floor. I call it floor time and it helps de-stress. 

I eat whatever my wife wants to eat or cooks. If not, we have our recipe book where we just randomly say a number to choose what.

One common mistake is choosing coffee purely based on price. Cheap coffee might save money upfront, but if employees don’t enjoy it, the machine gets ignored or people step out for café runs. That defeats the whole purpose of having a [tea coffee vending machine for small office](https://sarcoffee.com/) setups.

Another issue is ignoring consistency. Vending coffee needs to taste the same every single time. Even decent-quality coffee can feel “bad” if the flavor changes cup to cup due to poor blends or unstable formulations.

Product fit is another big miss. What works in a factory may not work in a corporate office. Small offices usually need fewer options, faster dispensing, and reliable taste rather than too many varieties that rarely get used.

Lastly, businesses often overlook maintenance and refilling cycles. Even the best coffee won’t help if the machine runs out often or isn’t cleaned properly.

Since last week, they’ve been visiting our house, and I honestly can’t believe they came twice this week?!?!?! I really don’t know or have any idea if they have some changes they need to implement, because my family is pretty inactive, and I myself haven’t been to church in seven years.

They visited us again this morning. My sibling preparing for an exam while I have online meetings to attend. In short, even though I’m home all the time, I’m still pretty busy since I’m a graduating college student.

Now I’m imagining horrible days ahead, thinking, “What if I just finished showering and they suddenly show up? And I haven’t prepared my clothes since my outdoor clothes are in the cabinet outside?” I’m running these thoughts over and over in my head, and I’ve concluded that I don’t feel free in my own house.

Their unexpected visits make me uncomfortable and frustrated. What do they mean I have to entertain them and just drop the important things I’ve scheduled?

I spent months feeling like time was slipping through my fingers. 8-hour workdays felt like 4. Weekends disappeared before I blinked. I'd scroll back through my calendar wondering where entire weeks went.

Then I fell into a rabbit hole of research. Books on time perception, neuroscience podcasts, studies on productivity systems. What I found completely shifted how I structure my days. And honestly? My days feel longer now. Not in a dragging way but in a ""holy shit I actually got everything done AND had time to chill"" way.

Here's what actually works:

Time feels faster when you're on autopilot. Your brain literally compresses memories of routine activities. That's why your commute home feels shorter than your morning drive, why summer felt endless as a kid but now flies by as an adult. The solution isn't cramping more tasks into your day. It's about strategic novelty and attention anchors.

Front-load hard work in 90-minute blocks

Your brain operates in ultradian rhythms, roughly 90-120 minute cycles of high and low alertness. Most people fight this and wonder why they crash at 2pm. Instead, I do one deep work block right after waking (usually 7am-8:30am) when my cortisol is naturally high. No email, no Slack, just the hardest thing on my list.

The neuroscientist Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast. He explains how your prefrontal cortex has limited bandwidth, it depletes as the day goes on. Use it early or lose it to decision fatigue. After discovering his work, I started protecting my mornings religiously. That single block makes my entire day feel productive, even if the afternoon is a wash.

Try the app Forest for those deep work sessions. You plant a virtual tree that dies if you leave the app. Sounds silly but the visual accountability actually works. I've grown an entire forest over the past year.

Create artificial ""memory bookmarks"" throughout your day

This is weird but backed by memory research. Our brains timestamp memories using novel experiences and emotional peaks. If every day bleeds together, time feels compressed.

I started doing tiny unexpected things. Different lunch spot every Wednesday. 10-minute walk to a new street after dinner. Calling a friend I haven't talked to in months during my coffee break. These aren't huge time investments, maybe 15-30 minutes total, but when I reflect on my week, I remember THAT Tuesday I tried the Vietnamese spot, THAT Thursday I explored the park three blocks over. My weeks feel distinct now instead of like one long blur.

Read ""The Power of Moments"" by Chip Heath and Dan Heath. This book is a masterclass in engineering memorable experiences. The authors studied why certain moments stick in our memories while years disappear. It's not about grand gestures, it's about elevation, insight, pride, and connection. The chapter on ""breaking the script"" literally changed how I approach routine. Quick read, immediately applicable.

Implement ""shutdown rituals"" to separate your day into chapters

One of the reasons workdays blend together is lack of closure. You stop working but your brain doesn't register the transition. Cal Newport writes about this extensively in ""Deep Work"". He's a computer science professor who's published 9 books while maintaining work-life balance, his secret is strict boundaries and rituals.

My shutdown ritual: review tomorrow's top 3 tasks, close all browser tabs, physically close my laptop and say ""schedule shutdown complete"" out loud. Sounds ridiculous but the verbal confirmation signals to my brain that work mode is OVER.

This creates psychological chapters in your day. Morning deep work block, afternoon meetings/admin, evening personal time. Each section feels distinct. Your day doesn't blur into one continuous experience.

If you want to go deeper on time perception and productivity psychology but struggle to find time to read through dense books or research, there's an app called BeFreed that's been helpful. It's a personalized learning platform that turns books, expert podcasts, and research papers into custom audio lessons.

You can type something like ""I feel like time is slipping away and want to master deep work and attention management"", and it pulls from resources like Cal Newport's work, neuroscience research, and productivity experts to create a structured learning plan just for you. You control the depth too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples when something really clicks.

What makes it stick is the voice options, you can pick anything from a calm, focused narrator to something more energetic depending on your mood. Plus you can pause mid-lesson to ask questions or explore tangents, kind of like having a smart coach who actually gets what you're trying to figure out.

Batch low-value tasks into ""maintenance windows""

Email, Slack messages, random admin stuff. These create the ILLUSION of productivity while fragmenting your attention. Every time you switch tasks, your brain needs 15-25 minutes to fully re-engage with deep work (this is called attention residue, studied extensively by Sophie Leroy).

I have two 30-minute ""maintenance windows"" per day. 11am and 4pm. That's when I process email, respond to messages, handle quick requests. Outside those windows, everything's closed. People worried I'd miss urgent stuff but honestly? Nothing is as urgent as people think. And batching this work makes it feel less overwhelming.

Check out the podcast ""Eat Sleep Work Repeat"" by Bruce Daisley. He was Twitter's VP in Europe and now researches workplace psychology. His episode on attention management with Johann Hari is INCREDIBLE. They discuss how our attention economy is designed to fragment our time perception and practical ways to fight back.

Use ""analog anchors"" for key transitions

Digital tools blend together. Physical actions create stronger memories. I started using a physical timer for work blocks, writing daily intentions in an actual notebook, making coffee as a morning ritual. These tangible moments anchor my day in physical reality.

The ""Productivity Planner"" by Intelligent Change uses this principle. It's paper-based, forces you to identify your ONE most important task each day, and tracks your time in physical blocks. Something about writing with pen on paper makes time feel more real? More deliberate? I can flip back through weeks and actually remember what I did.

Build in ""white space"" deliberately

Counterintuitive but crucial. If you pack every minute, your brain compresses time. Schedule 15-minute gaps between meetings. Take lunch away from your desk. The book ""168 Hours"" by Laura Vanderkam destroyed my scarcity mindset around time. She tracked how successful people ACTUALLY spend their 168 hours each week.

Turns out, the most ""productive"" people aren't cramming more in, they're protecting empty space for thinking, transitions, and spontaneity. These gaps make your day feel spacious instead of suffocating. I blocked out 30 minutes every afternoon as ""flex time."" Sometimes I use it for overflow work. Sometimes I just stare out the window. Either way, that buffer makes my day feel less frantic.

Here's the truth nobody wants to hear: We don't have a time problem, we have an attention problem. Your days aren't too short, they're too fragmented. Every notification, every task-switch, every moment of mindless scrolling compresses your perception of time.

The strategies above aren't about squeezing more productivity from your day. They're about experiencing your day more fully. When you're present, intentional, and structured, time expands. Not because you're doing more, but because you're actually EXPERIENCING what you're doing.

Start with one thing. Just one. Pick the strategy that resonates most and try it for a week. I started with morning deep work blocks. That single change cascaded into everything else.

It’s not the world around me, my place in it, it’s not situations, circumstances, events, accomplishments, failures, whatever, whatever. My life isn’t school, isn’t whatever people may be doing to complicate things, it isn’t the things that give me white hairs at 21.

It’s me. If I were to put my hand over my chest, feel my heart beating beneath it, that’s my life. It’s mine. And I only get one.

I was staring at the stars and was struck by the realization that I am indeed alive. So many times, I’ve wanted to die, and one time I almost did, or felt very close to the edge. I was sure that the stars I was looking at that night were going to be the last ones I would get to see. But, almost a year later, I found myself looking up at them again, feeling suddenly very aware that I am still alive. I felt glad I think. I guess, so many times I could have lost my life, but I still have it — and that’s something that feels a bit profound.

“How Can You Mend a Broken Heart” - Al Green.

I had that really bad crash after a hypomanic(?) episode right before getting medicated. It felt like the world was splitting open and falling into itself in a great chasm and I was falling with it, ground crumbling beneath my feet. It was such an odd or surreal feeling, because I felt so high, things felt so absolutely magical and gleaming in a way. It was ethereal, I felt like I was on top of the world or maybe beyond it in someway.

One moment I was feeling way too great about myself and untouchable, then it began to shift. It was like sitting a piece of paper on top of water. One second it was intact, then the water began to trickle in, spread over its surface, soak over the fibers, and everything began to dissolve almost rapidly. I went from feeling like a holy being, to feeling like the worst and most pathetic thing to exist.

I thought I was going to die that night. I didn’t, I managed to get myself inside and laid in bed instead. And when I pulled myself out of bed days later and eventually forced myself to go to class, that song by Al Green played on one of my playlists. The sun was shining through the bus windows, brilliantly, nearly blindingly, but beautiful. It was the end of winter, but I think it was a warmer day than usual. I had a peaceful moment to drink my coffee before my class, and it tasted extra good because I was thankful that I still got to enjoy it. I was grateful to still be alive and to continue to experience the little things I love in life. Music, sun, coffee, quiet mornings, the beauty in buildings and in nature. That song brings me back to that morning. It’s a fragile, bittersweet feeling.",2,1770967786.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

I live in a friendly college town so many people are open to greeting and making friends easily, I just have to get myself out there outside of work and living at home alone.

All we really need in life is this:

Air in our lungs.

Food in our stomachs.

Water to drink.

Legs to walk.

Hands to touch.

A tongue to speak.

And just one person.

One lover.

One friend.

Just one.

The rest can be worked out.

The rest can be built.

The rest can be found.

The rest can be survived.

I’ve got everything —

except the one person.

Even one friend would get me through a long time.

Just one call.

One message.

One “how are you?”

One “you okay?”

One “wanna grab a coffee?”

One “come sit with me for a while.”

I always said I didn’t need friends.

I was lying.

I always needed them.

I just never wanted to admit it.

I miss being a kid.

I miss the smell of damp bush after rain.

The sound of kids running through the street.

The mindless hours of doing nothing.

Just playing.

Just existing.

Just being.

We saw the world in gold and orange,

in rainbows and bright colours,

in peace and wonder.

We always wanted to grow up too fast.

And now it’s too late.

Now everything is grey.

The colours faded.

Friends faded.

Family faded.

The world faded.

All I want to do is go play again.

I want to reach back to my younger self,

take his hand,

and tell him:

“It’s going to be okay.

You’ll work it out.

Stay a kid as long as you can.

Enjoy it.

There’s no turning back.”

I’m stuck on a really weird CPU/firmware issue and would appreciate input from people who’ve seen low-level ACPI / SMP problems before.



🎯 Goal  

Turn this machine into a 24/7 home server (Docker, media streaming, file server).



🖥️ System Details

\- CPU: Intel Core i5-8500T (Coffee Lake, 6C/6T, no HT)

\- Motherboard: Intel H310 chipset (OEM / budget board)

\- RAM: 8 GB DDR4-2533

\- Storage: 512 GB NVMe

\- OS: Debian 13 (Trixie)

\- Kernel: 6.12.69

\- BIOS: v360BV011 (Oct 2022)



❗ The Problem

Linux only sees ONE CPU core, even though the CPU is a 6-core part.



lscpu output (wrong):

CPU(s):              1

Core(s) per socket:  1

Thread(s) per core:  1



🔍 Key Discovery

The system only boots if I use these kernel parameters:

nomodeset acpi=off nolapic noapic



Without them:

\- Kernel crashes or freezes right after GRUB

\- dmesg shows SMP being disabled when LAPIC is unavailable



This obviously forces single-core mode.



🧠 BIOS Sees All 6 Cores

In BIOS CPU info screen:

\- L1 Data Cache: 32 KB × 6

\- L1 Instruction Cache: 32 KB × 6

\- L2 Cache: 256 KB × 6

\- L3 Cache: 9 MB



So the CPU hardware is fine and fully detected by firmware.



🧪 What I’ve Tested

\- Removing all boot params → system crashes

\- acpi=ht, noapic, mixed combinations → crash

\- maxcpus=6 / possible\_cpus=6 → boots but still 1 core

\- No MCE errors

\- Temps normal (41–43°C)

\- Microcode loaded correctly



Conclusion: software can’t enable the other cores without ACPI/LAPIC.



⚙️ BIOS Investigation

\- “Active Processor Cores” = All

\- Several CPU features were disabled by default:

  \- Hardware Prefetcher

  \- Adjacent Cache Line Prefetch

  \- Intel VMX

  \- C-states



Enabling these did not immediately fix SMP.



No obvious option yet for:

\- Limit CPUID Maximum

\- APIC / x2APIC / IOAPIC (may be hidden)



📌 Current Status

✅ Working

\- System stable

\- CPU silicon healthy

\- BIOS detects all cores



❌ Broken

\- SMP completely disabled

\- ACPI crashes kernel

\- No power management

\- Server workloads impossible



🧠 Suspected Root Cause

One of the following:

1. Broken ACPI MADT table in OEM H310 BIOS

2. Hidden “Limit CPUID Maximum” enabled

3. APIC/x2APIC disabled or misconfigured

4. General OEM firmware bug (common on low-end H310 boards)



❓ What I’m Asking

\- Has anyone seen BIOS-detected multi-core CPUs stuck at 1 core on Linux?

\- Any known H310 ACPI bugs with Coffee Lake?

\- Any kernel-side workaround short of replacing the motherboard?

\- Any safe way to dump/override a bad MADT?



📎 Why This Matters

With 1 core:

\- Docker unusable

\- Media transcoding impossible

\- High I/O wait



With 6 cores:

\- Perfect low-power home server

\- Intel Quick Sync

\- Docker + media + NAS



Thanks in advance — happy to provide dmesg logs, ACPI dumps, or BIOS photos if needed.

figuring out parking for the tar heels vs pitt game on 02/14 is going to be a bit of a headache since it is a saturday afternoon game and also happens to be valentines day. the area around the smith center gets pretty wild so i figured i would share what i know to help you avoid getting stuck in gridlock on manning drive.  
  
honestly your best bet is to check the Prked app first. you can find people renting out their own driveways or private garage spots right next to the dean dome. it is way cheaper than the official university lots and the best part is you do not have to deal with the massive line of cars trying to get out of the decks after the game. it is usually just a quick walk to the arena and you skip the worst traffic.  
  
if you do not go the Prked route the most common way to get there is the tar heel express shuttle. it is five dollars for a round-trip ticket and they are cashless now so you need a card or apple pay. the buses pick up at the friday center off nc-54, southern village off 15-501, and near the carolina coffee shop downtown. the friday center shuttles usually start two hours before the 2:00 pm tip-off and the other locations start about ninety minutes before. they drop you off right in front of the smith center which is nice because it saves you from walking up the hills.  
  
most of the lots right next to the arena like skipper bowles, williamson lot, and the manning lot are reserved for rams club donors with permits so do not even try to park there unless you bought a pass ahead of time on a site like seatgeek or vivid seats. you might find some public spots at the dogwood deck near the hospital on manning drive but it costs about twenty dollars and fills up early with hospital staff and fans. if you park downtown in the rosemary street or columbia street decks be prepared for a thirty dollar special event rate and a long uphill walk to the game.  
  
watch out for the residential streets nearby because chapel hill is super strict about towing anyone without a permit. traffic is going to be especially bad at the intersection of 15-501 and raleigh road because of people heading downtown for valentines day lunch and dinner. if you are coming from raleigh try taking highway 64 to 15-501 north instead of i-40 to avoid the worst of the highway 54 backup. hope this helps and go heels.",1,1770967172.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Jacob and a person to be named later, OR  
Katherine and Elliot!

Kat is still young enough to have another baby- which would make Casey sibling to Alice.

That would explain why Casey was SO EXCITED to talk to Kat- how they just Drank In *looking* at Kat that first day in the newspaper office.

They seemed kinda aloof talking to Alice- which indicates maybe the siblings so far apart in age don't have a great relationship? Regardless, they didn't really seem too keen on connecting with Alice, much.   
  
They did kinda dance around it a few times, like trying to get Alice to initiate the 'hey you should hang out with us' invite that never happened (""I'm the new kid in town, no friends, you know how that is"")- but Casey never asked Alice to come over, grab a coffee, nothing. Casey never 'went after' Alice- the way they went after Kat.

Also, we never see Casey talking to Elliot. Almost like they're avoiding him for some reason...like family traits that Elliot might recognize, especially since Elliot knows about the pond.

If Casey was Alice's child (which is Alice's theory), then wouldn't Casey be chomping at the bit to talk to Alice, and be around Alice (their mom), as much as possible? But no! Casey was chomping at the bit to talk to Kat, and worked all summer for free to be around Kat! 

This would explain (somewhat) how Casey got the engagement ring. Alice gives it to them, for a reason to be revealed later...

OR

Casey is Jacob's child. Jacob spent Casey's whole life telling Casey how important Kat was to him, how she saved his life (probably omitting a few details, lol), how wonderful she was, on and on... and in this theory, for whatever reason, Kat isn't around Jacob, or Casey. So that would explain why Casey seemed to kinda **idolize** Kat from the beginning- because their dad had idolized Kat, and passed that on to his child.

In *this* scenario, Alice gives the ring to Jacob, to marry Casey's mother. Which is how Casey gets the ring.",2,1770967113.0,TheWayHomeHallmark,3,1.0,False

1r3iopt,https://i.redd.it/8i8fhn81q7jg1.jpeg,I built an iOS app to fix the “what should we do?” group chat problem,"I kept running into the same issue with my friends.

Someone would ask “what should we do?”, the group chat would fill with ideas, half the people would say “I’m down for anything”, and nothing ever actually got decided.

So I built an iOS app to fix that.

It’s called What Now?

The idea is simple:

	•	Create a session

	•	Invite your friends

	•	Everyone swipes and votes on food places and activities

	•	The group decides together

When the session is live, you can add photos, and it all gets saved to a Memories tab so plans don’t just disappear.

It’s private by default, built around friends (not followers), and meant to be used anytime of day — coffee, dinner, spontaneous plans, whatever.

Would love for people here to check it out if it sounds useful. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

1r3ijqk,https://i.redd.it/jzxw1isfo7jg1.jpeg,Delonghi Magnifica Plus Review (ECAM320.70.SB),"I purchased the Magnifica Plus to replace my aging Magnifica S. I managed to get it for AU$1125.40 (US$797, €672).

I'd been looking to upgrade for some time to a super automatic and did a lot of research before I decided on the Plus.

My 'S' had served me well, so I trusted the Delonghi brand enough to stick with it. The Plus in my view, represents the best value for money in Delonghi's super automatic range. It has a lot of the features of the models above it, particularly with the touch screen and adjustable foam for the milk carafe.

The Plus looks great, mine is the 'Silver/Black' version, but to my eyes the silver has a touch of gold. It seems solidly built, is not too large and fits nicely on my kitchen bench.

The puck/drip tray and water tank are very similar to my 'S' and are both easy to slide out and put back in. I do like the silver grille on the drip tray, and the black raised ridges which prevents coffee cups from scratching the metal.

The milk carafe simply clicks into place and is easy to disassemble for cleaning. I also like the ability to quickly flush hot water through the nozzle, simply by turning the froth adjuster all the way to the right.

The touch screen is bright, colourful and easy to use, with fluid animations and will prompt you (in a friendly way) with tips and when certain functions need to happen.

Setup was a breeze. The machine prompts you to do certain things each step of the way and it was up and running within a few minutes.

There is a settings menu which allows you to change the water hardness if needed, the water temperature (I have mine set to high), as well as the length of time the machine will take to switch off when idle. In this menu you can also reset the machine or individual profiles to factory default and also tell the machine to perform a rinse or descaling cycle if needed. It also shows you how many drinks you have made, broken down into drink types and will show a progress bar to when the next descaling cycle is due.

There are 18 drinks to choose from:

***Coffee*** *- Americano, Coffee, Doppio+, Espresso, 2x Espresso, Filter Stye*

***Milk*** *- Caffelatte, Cappuccino, Cappuccino Mix, Cappuccino+, Cortado, Espresso Macchiato, Flat White, Hot Milk, Latte Macchiato*

***Cold*** *- Iced Coffee, Iced Americano*

*Hot Water*

The 'cold' drinks are not cold brew like models above it - the machine simply instructs you to put ice in a glass and then will pour espresso over the ice.

With my beans, they extract best at a grind setting of '3'. Keep in mind, you can only change the grind setting whilst the machine is actually grinding. For intensity (which can be chosen manually on the screen), I prefer 2 or 3.

The milk carafe can make milk with very little froth, to a lot of froth, and anything in between. Temperature wise it's fine. The frothier you make the milk, the hotter it will be. To assist in having the milk as hot as possible, I always run a rinse cycle and warm my cup before each use.

The espresso the Plus makes is great for a super automatic, better than my 'S'. Whilst not as good as a manual machine, it's pretty close once you have worked out the right grind setting and intensity.

The machine allows up to four profiles, and you can easily switch between them by pressing the profile button to the left of the display. Each one is individually coloured, and you can set names to them.

Before brewing a chosen drink, you can choose the intensity and cup size and the machine will ask if you want to save these settings after the brew is finished. You access this be pressing the customisation bar below the drink you want to brew. If you just press on the drink, it will brew using the default settings or the one you previously saved.

The 'My' function is great. Basically, it allows you to set how much espresso (and milk) you want for each individual drink. This is particularly useful for larger cups that need more milk to fill them. It is saved just for that drink on that particular profile. You can reset this, so the machine reverts to the default settings for that drink.

Overall, I find the Plus an extremely easy and pleasant super auto to use. It makes consistently great drinks is almost fool proof and very easy to maintain. Definitely a great machine for those new to super autos and automated espresso machines in general.",3,1770966465.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False
1r3ijap,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3ijap,My tiny bit magical food manifestations!!,"&#x200B;

Okay guys I need to tell you something and you tell me if this is normal or if I’m just doing elite level pattern recognition 😭..

These are my tiny food “manifestations” lol.

so the first one:

My sister sent me a picture of white sauce pasta she made. We live in different cities so I couldn’t just go eat it. And in my house ordering food randomly is not really a thing. It’s kind of a luxury, not an everyday thing.

I saw that picture and I wanted it so bad. Like intensely.

Three hours later my dad randomly wins a quiz and gets invited to a restaurant with free food for the family. He calls me and asks what I want,I say white sauce pasta and I get it the same day...Okay fine,Maybe coincidence.

Second one:

I once tasted a very specific dish from my friend’s lunchbox. I loved it and thought wow I wish mom would make this. But I never told her. I literally forgot about it.

Important detail. That dish had not been cooked in our house for eight to nine months...

Next morning, Sunday, she randomly says she’s making that exact dish for breakfast.I never mentioned it go her like Not even once,so i was like lowkey surprised😭

Now third one is the  burger story because this one is detailed....

In the morning I watched Jungkook’s live highlight where he was eating a burger, fries and drinking cold coffee(ig you all know which live I'm talking about lol😭)For eighteen whole minutes I was staring more at the burger than at him. Please don’t judge me. I just love burger 😭

Fast food at my house is not common, It’s like a luxury. So I was just quietly wanting it....

While he was eating fries with ketchup I literally thought nahh bro I don’t even like ketchup.... Jungkook bruh our choices are not same if i ever eat something I'd love to eat it without any sauce....

That same evening my uncle visited. We actually went out planning to eat street food but on the way it got late so our plan changed in the middle of the road and we went to a restaurant instead.

and coincidentally we went to the restaurant of which burgers are so famous and tasty he asked me what i want and i immediately said burger😭I was internally losing it.He asked if I wanted fries too. But at that moment I didn’t really feel like eating fries so I said no.

I ordered a Coke because that’s what I wanted then. After that he even asked if I wanted cold coffee...

Now here’s the very specific part.

When the food came, there was no ketchup on the table😭😭

Usually they automatically give ketchup with burgers and fries. My uncle even noticed and said hey they forgot to give ketchup.

And I just said it’s okay I don’t like ketchup anyway.

I had literally thought about not wanting ketchup in the morning while watching that live.

okay the last one,

One day I tried calling my dad to tell him I wanted something. He cut the call because he was busy, I forgot about it because yeah I've adhd😭,then i suddenly remembered it The next day that oh i wanted that to eat and then I was like never mind and The same night he came home with that exact thing. Something I hadn’t eaten in like four months...I never reminded him about that😭

So I just want to ask,

Are these just small food manifestations lol. Does this happen to you guys too. Or am I just connecting random dots because my brain likes patterns.

1r3iisg,https://i.redd.it/se1dq2gs57jg1.jpeg,Delonghi Magnifica Plus Review (ECAM320.70.SB),"I purchased the Magnifica Plus to replace my aging Magnifica S. I managed to get it for AU$1125.40 (US$797, €672).

I'd been looking to upgrade for some time to a super automatic and did a lot of research before I decided on the Plus.

My 'S' had served me well, so I trusted the Delonghi brand enough to stick with it. The Plus in my view, represents the best value for money in Delonghi's super automatic range. It has a lot of the features of the models above it, particularly with the touch screen and adjustable foam for the milk carafe.

The Plus looks great, mine is the 'Silver/Black' version, but to my eyes the silver has a touch of gold. It seems solidly built, is not too large and fits nicely on my kitchen bench.

The puck/drip tray and water tank are very similar to my 'S' and are both easy to slide out and put back in. I do like the silver grille on the drip tray, and the black raised ridges which prevents coffee cups from scratching the metal.

The milk carafe simply clicks into place and is easy to disassemble for cleaning. I also like the ability to quickly flush hot water through the nozzle, simply by turning the froth adjuster all the way to the right.

The touch screen is bright, colourful and easy to use, with fluid animations and will prompt you (in a friendly way) with tips and when certain functions need to happen.

Setup was a breeze. The machine prompts you to do certain things each step of the way and it was up and running within a few minutes.

There is a settings menu which allows you to change the water hardness if needed, the water temperature (I have mine set to high), as well as the length of time the machine will take to switch off when idle. In this menu you can also reset the machine or individual profiles to factory default and also tell the machine to perform a rinse or descaling cycle if needed. It also shows you how many drinks you have made, broken down into drink types and will show a progress bar to when the next descaling cycle is due.

There are 18 drinks to choose from:

***Coffee*** *- Americano, Coffee, Doppio+, Espresso, 2x Espresso, Filter Stye*

***Milk*** *- Caffelatte, Cappuccino, Cappuccino Mix, Cappuccino+, Cortado, Espresso Macchiato, Flat White, Hot Milk, Latte Macchiato*

***Cold*** *- Iced Coffee, Iced Americano*

*Hot Water*

The 'cold' drinks are not cold brew like models above it - the machine simply instructs you to put ice in a glass and then will pour espresso over the ice.

With my beans, they extract best at a grind setting of '3'. Keep in mind, you can only change the grind setting whilst the machine is actually grinding. For intensity (which can be chosen manually on the screen), I prefer 2 or 3.

The milk carafe can make milk with very little froth, to a lot of froth, and anything in between. Temperature wise it's fine. The frothier you make the milk, the hotter it will be. To assist in having the milk as hot as possible, I always run a rinse cycle and warm my cup before each use.

The espresso the Plus makes is great for a super automatic, better than my 'S'. Whilst not as good as a manual machine, it's pretty close once you have worked out the right grind setting and intensity.

The machine allows up to four profiles, and you can easily switch between them by pressing the profile button to the left of the display. Each one is individually coloured, and you can set names to them.

Before brewing a chosen drink, you can choose the intensity and cup size and the machine will ask if you want to save these settings after the brew is finished. You access this be pressing the customisation bar below the drink you want to brew. If you just press on the drink, it will brew using the default settings or the one you previously saved.

The 'My' function is great. Basically, it allows you to set how much espresso (and milk) you want for each individual drink. This is particularly useful for larger cups that need more milk to fill them. It is saved just for that drink on that particular profile. You can reset this, so the machine reverts to the default settings for that drink.

Overall, I find the Plus an extremely easy and pleasant super auto to use. It makes consistently great drinks is almost fool proof and very easy to maintain. Definitely a great machine for those new to super autos and automated espresso machines in general.",6,1770966371.0,superautomatic,4,1.0,False

Eleven years ago, at 19, I was having one of the worst periods of my life: mom’s serious diagnosis, a painful breakup, feeling completely lost.
In a small park near university I found an old bench with childish carving:

“If you’re sad, leave a note here. Someone will read it.”
I didn’t expect anything, but I wrote anyway:
“Hi. Today everything feels too heavy. If you’re here too… maybe tomorrow will be a little kinder.
— Elias”

A week later my note was gone. In its place:
“Hi Elias. Tomorrow WILL be kinder, I promise. Thinking of you and your mom.

— someone who cried on this bench last month”
That reply literally made me sob with relief on the spot.
For the next eleven years I left 87 letters. I wrote about mom’s operations, my first job, panic attacks, adopting a three-legged dog named Toast, finally daring to date again.

Every time — within days — a reply appeared. Her name was Mara. An artist who visited this park because of her grandmother four hours away. She sent tiny pencil sketches sometimes: the bench, Toast, a sunrise after my saddest letter.

We never swapped numbers. Never met. Never even described our appearance. That was the quiet magic.
Yesterday I found a thicker envelope:
A letter + Polaroid of the bench. On it — a woman with dark curls holding a sign:

“Elias, I’m here. Right now. Third bench from the left. Come say hi if you want.

— Mara (finally brave)”
My heart was exploding. I walked over. She looked up, gave the most nervous-beautiful smile and said:
“Eleven years felt like enough time to stay strangers.”
We talked four hours straight. She brought coffee and croissants. Toast immediately claimed her lap. At sunset she asked quietly:

“Would it ruin everything if we exchanged numbers now?”
I laughed until tears came.

“No. It would make everything better.”
Tonight Toast and I are going to her place for her grandma’s lasagna. I’m bringing the terrible red wine I always complained about in letters.
Eleven years of paper turned into one real, smiling, beginning.

The bench is still waiting — for the next two people who need to believe tomorrow can be kinder.",33,1770966172.0,happy,8,0.86,False

1r3if0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/1r3if0g/do_not_join_the_meto_union/,Do Not Join the METO Union,"What follows is a story about how the union did absolutely nothing, yet still collected 50 euros every month in membership fees. So grab a coffee and sit down, because this is a long one.

The whole story began in 2022. At the time, I was employed as a forest expert in Southern Finland, on a permanent contract at one of the larger Finnish forestry companies. I was asked to take part in a project assignment lasting one year and two months (November 2022 – December 2023). It sounded interesting, so I accepted.  
We signed a project contract clearly stating that I would return to my ordinary position once the project ended.

When the project concluded, I returned to the office and discovered that someone else was sitting in my office. During the project period I had worked elsewhere and had not been at that office at all. The person told me he was permanently employed in *my* position.

Naturally, we were both surprised and called our manager. It then became clear that they had simply forgotten about me.  
HR was brought in, and I contacted the union. The union’s response was:  
**“As long as your salary is being paid, there’s nothing we need to do.”**  
HR did not have any work and could not explain what had happened.

Without any work assignments, I stayed at home in January and February 2024 while still receiving my salary. In early March, my manager called and offered me another project, running from March 2024 until June 2025.  
Once again, we signed a project contract stating that I would return to my ordinary position afterward.

I raised this issue with the union and asked how such a clause could be included when my original position was already occupied. Their response:  
**“We’ll look into it after the project ends.”**

This project was based in Sweden. As early as April 2025, my Swedish manager informed Finnish HR and the manager of my department that I would soon be returning.  
The response we received was:  
**“He must apply for a new internal position himself.”**

I forwarded this to the union. They told me to stay in contact with my union representative, which I did. The answers were vague and evasive:  
– “I’ll talk to HR.”  
– “Come back to Finland and we’ll look at it.”  
– “There’s nothing available at the moment.”  
– “Apply for all internal positions in the system.”

On July 1st 2025, I returned to Finland, without a job. I had already started applying internally in April but was not invited to a single interview. When I raised this with the union, they replied:  
**“We have no ability to influence internal or external recruitment.”**

Throughout July, August, September, and October 2025, I remained at home on full pay. I asked the union to arrange a meeting with HR and management to clarify what had gone wrong. It was obvious that a serious mistake had been made back in 2022. But nothing happened. Just silence.

I knew something was wrong. It is not normal for an employee to sit idle on full salary for such a long period. Even my colleagues found the situation strange, there was plenty of work within the company (Work I applied for, had experience and education in).

In October, notices of furlough were issued. I was singled out and required to take **six weeks of furlough**. No one else in the company had such a long period. Most were given two or three weeks, and the maximum was four for some.  
When I raised this with the union, they said:  
**“They are allowed to do this. There’s nothing we can do.”**

I was furloughed from the end of October until the second week of December 2025.

# Now comes the second “fun” part

In November, restructuring negotiations began and surprise, surprise. I was selected for redundancy due to production and economic reasons.  
I contacted the union again. This time, a lawyer was involved, and I believed the case would finally be properly examined. I had saved contracts, emails and documentation.

It turned out to be the least interested lawyer I have ever dealt with. All he said was:  
**“They are allowed to do this. It is highly unethical, but no law has been broken.”**

After that, the union went completely silent. They stopped responding to emails and did not answer my calls.  
I was laid off with three months’ pay, a “nice” Christmas gift.

I have a new job, so financially everything is fine. Still, the experience leaves a bitter taste. At the same time, I am relieved not to be at that company anymore. According to former colleagues, working conditions have only worsened, with higher pressure, quotas, and targets.

We won’t even go into all the unethical and outright illegal, practices the company has engaged in and continues to engage in. But that is another story for your eyes to read. 

Now I started my new job in the same field, I informed the union that I no longer wished to be a member. Only then, did they suddenly contact me, warning that I would lose their “protection,” benefits, and offers.  
Quite ironic, considering I received no help when I actually needed it.

Moreover, while most other industries received pay raises of 4–7%, the union considered it a success to have negotiated **2.5% raise divided over two years**.  
They did not even raise entry-level salaries, which have remained unchanged for ten years.

Looking at the background of union leadership, it is clear how deeply intertwined they are with the forestry companies. Those are not relationships they want to jeopardize, otherwise, board seats and bonuses might be at risk.

Have a nice day, everyone.

Edit: Anyone who interprets this as me being a bad employee and therefore singled out and fired, is mistaken. I have a proven track record of high-quality work and strong recommendation letters from every former manager I’ve worked with. With those recommendations, I secured a new job after only one month of unemployment.",3,1770966012.0,Finland,26,0.53,False

1r3iaj1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3iaj1,Are these tiny manifestations or Am I just delusion!!,"&#x200B;

Okay guys I need to tell you something and you tell me if this is normal or if I’m just doing elite level pattern recognition 😭..

These are my tiny food “manifestations” lol.

so the first one:

My sister sent me a picture of white sauce pasta she made. We live in different cities so I couldn’t just go eat it. And in my house ordering food randomly is not really a thing. It’s kind of a luxury, not an everyday thing.

I saw that picture and I wanted it so bad. Like intensely.

Three hours later my dad randomly wins a quiz and gets invited to a restaurant with free food for the family. He calls me and asks what I want,I say white sauce pasta and I get it the same day...

Okay fine,Maybe coincidence.

Second one.

I once tasted a very specific dish from my friend’s lunchbox. I loved it and thought wow I wish mom would make this. But I never told her. I literally forgot about it.

Important detail. That dish had not been cooked in our house for eight to nine months...

Next morning, Sunday, she randomly says she’s making that exact dish for breakfast.I never mentioned it go her like Not even once,so i was like lowkey surprised😭

Now third one is the burger story because this one is detailed....

In the morning I watched Jungkook’s live highlight where he was eating a burger, fries and drinking cold coffee(ig you all know which live I'm talking about lol😭)For eighteen whole minutes I was staring more at the burger than at him. Please don’t judge me. I just love burger 😭

Fast food at my house is not common, It’s like a luxury. So I was just quietly wanting it....

While he was eating fries with ketchup I literally thought nahh bro I don’t even like ketchup.... Jungkook bruh our choices are not same if i ever eat something I'd love to eat it without any sauce....

That same evening my uncle visited. We actually went out planning to eat street food but on the way it got late so our plan changed in the middle of the road and we went to a restaurant instead.

and coincidentally we went to the restaurant of which burgers are so famous and tasty he asked me what i want and i immediately said burger😭I was internally losing it.He asked if I wanted fries too. But at that moment I didn’t really feel like eating fries so I said no.

I ordered a Coke because that’s what I wanted then. After that he even asked if I wanted cold coffee...

Now here’s the very specific part.

When the food came, there was no ketchup on the table😭😭

Usually they automatically give ketchup with burgers and fries. My uncle even noticed and said hey they forgot to give ketchup.

And I just said it’s okay I don’t like ketchup anyway.

I had literally thought about not wanting ketchup in the morning while watching that live.

okay the last one,

One day I tried calling my dad to tell him I wanted something. He cut the call because he was busy, I forgot about it because yeah I've adhd😭,then i suddenly remembered it The next day that oh i wanted that to eat and then I was like never mind and The same night he came home with that exact thing. Something I hadn’t eaten in like four months...I never reminded him about that😭

So I just want to ask,

Are these just small food manifestations lol. Does this happen to you guys too. Or am I just connecting random dots because my brain likes patterns.

Because it’s not like I’m scripting or obsessing. I just want it strongly for a moment and then I let it go.

And then somehow it shows up.

Be honest. Am I magical or just good at noticing coincidences 😭..

1r3i7of,https://www.reddit.com/r/restaurant/comments/1r3i7of/fast_food_restaurant_tier_list_from_my_experience/,Fast Food Restaurant Tier List from My Experience,"# Elite

* Chipotle: I could eat Chipotle every day of my life if I had to. The problem with Chipotle is the quantity, they fuck you, especially if you Door Dash, they fuck you.
* A&W: A&W is my favorite fast food restaurant ever. If I was dying on death row and they said, ""You have one more meal,"" that meal would be a Papa Burger combo with an extra-large root beer and probably one of those medium polar swirls.
* McDonald's: McDonald's is elite, I don't give a fuck what anyone says. The fries, their burgers, their breakfast sandwiches, I do agree they're getting a little bit expensive now but I love the Golden Arcs.
* Culver's: Culver's is right up there with A&W neck and neck. That's King Kong versus Godzilla right there.
* Texas Roadhouse: This place bangs. Don't even get me started on the fucking bread either. For like $16 I can go get a steak, a loaded baked potato, and then either a Caesar salad or a cup of delicious chili.
* Popeye's: They have the best spicy chicken sandwich in the world right now on the planet.
* Dairy Queen: I love Dairy Queen's food, their flamethrower burger, their double bacon cheeseburger, their chicken strips with the white gravy and the toast. The Blizzard, specifically the S'mores Blizzard, that's another death row meal very close to A&W too.
* Jersey Mike's: This is my sub shop next to Potbelly. Jersey Mike's, so fresh, so delicious, you got to get the vinegar and oil on it, I could eat it every day.
* Potbelly: Jersey Mike's and Potbelly is 1A and 1B for me.
* Chick-fil-A: Can never go wrong with CFA. Spicy chicken with pepper jack is the way. Is a little tad overrated though from what I've heard. Is it worth making your entire personality revolving around eating it fucking four times a week? No.

# Very Good

* Arby's: Thing about Arby's is you can't strafe away from the basics there, you got to go and just get the sliders. If you get a Buffalo chicken slider or a hot beef slider that shit is very good.
* Taco Bell: It's not quite elite but it's also very good. Trust me, the crunchy spicy potato taco, you're going to have a phenomenal meal. That potato taco is low-key the best thing on the menu, trust me, the sauce is.
* Auntie Anne's: Very good because I love pretzels. A hot salty pretzel with some cheese sauce, are you kidding me?
* Shake Shack: I had it once and I thought it was actually quite good. Burgers were greasy and I still remember them being tasty.
* Checkers: I had it once and it was outstanding. All I remember about it is the burger that they gave you weighed about 10 fucking pounds and their fries are deliciously seasoned.
* Cinnabon: If you don't like delicious little cinnamon pillows filled with cream, get the fuck out.
* Domino's: When you're in the mood for Domino's, that shit is great, and also that 2 for $6.99 deal, you're not beating that anywhere else.
* Five Guys: Horribly overpriced. The burger was absolutely delicious. You HAVE to get your fries well-done. HAVE to.
* Papa John's: Papa John's is great. One of if not the best pizza chains out there.
* Krispy Kreme: I love Krispy Kreme, just a glazed doughnut, can't even describe to you how heavenly it is.

# Nickelback

* Burger King: Forcefully hated. People love to hate it for absolutely no reason, Burger King is actually pretty good.
* Subway: Subway gets a lot of shit. Yes, their prices have become stupid but I'm always satisfied after I eat a Subway sandwich. It's good, it fills you up. For some reason they have the best mayonnaise too, I don't know why.
* White Castle: People act like this place is inconsumable when in reality it's just an acquired taste. If you like onion and you get a fresh White Castle burger you are going to have a blast. This place is a lot like Arby's, just don't venture away from the basics.
* Olive Garden: Olive Garden is like a meme restaurant to some people. I get it's a chain but like it's good and their chicken dumpling soup, holy shit so good.
* KFC: People act like it's trash food, the fuck it is. A bucket of their fried chicken fresh almost impossible to beat and they have a delicious peach Mountain Dew there.

# Decent, But Nothing Special

* Baskin-Robbins: Decent but nothing special, it's ice cream.
* Panda Express: I mean, it's chicken and rice, it's okay.
* Hooters: I have eaten at a Hooters before, it was decent. If you're going to Hooters as a 21-year-old or older, I'm going to be honest, the food is pretty irrelevant.
* Crumbl Cookies: Decent. The cookies are good but the problem I have with them is the cookies weigh about 15 fucking pounds per cookie so I have to eat them in like quarters.
* TGI Fridays: Decent, I mean it's a fucking TGI Fridays like what do you expect.
* Pizza Hut: This place is weird because everything there is good except the pizza. It's fucking crazy.
* Sonic: I would say painfully overrated but the hype has really died down. Went there once and got a burger, it was a burger.
* Wendy's: Sometimes I'll have it and I'm like ""This is really good"" and sometimes I'll have it and I'm disappointed. I also think you need a leaf blower to get all the salt off the fries.
* Red Robin: Decent, fries are okay, burgers are fine.
* Dunkin': Decent, I just had a cup of coffee, I mean, it was a cup of coffee.
* Starbucks: It's coffee.
* Nathan's Hot Dogs: Decent, had it in the airport, it was just an ordinary hot dog and fries.
* Hardee's: Their burgers were fine but half the time I got them there was so much sauce on them that my hands would be just destroyed by the second bite.
* Red Lobster: Decent, I think they're carried by their biscuits.
* Denny's: Decent, pretty good for breakfast food. Kind of hard to fuck up bacon and eggs though and if you do you should be in jail.
* Panera: One of my favorite cups of mac and cheese on the planet. Their soup in the bread bowl is delicious, their sandwich is scrumptious, the side of bread you get with the butter. Sad how overpriced and lower quality they've become though. Everything else on their menu is hospital food.

# Overrated

* Cold Stone: Is it good ice cream? Yes it is. But if I blindfolded you and threw Dairy Queen and Cold Stone in front of you and they had the same consistency you would not tell the difference.
* In-N-Out: Painfully overrated and I mean painfully. People act like if you go to a state or a city that has an In-N-Out you have to go there like it is just the biggest gem. I think you have to go there to see how average it is, it's a fucking burger and fries.
* Firehouse Subs: A decent sub sandwich except the portion they give you is like if you were a fucking first grader. Never ever full after Firehouse.
* Jimmy John's: Talk about never being full.

# Tolerable

* Buffalo Wild Wings: Tolerable at this point. BWW has probably had the most consistent downfall out of any restaurant I have ever seen. They do not listen to people at all. Wings have gotten smaller, sauce has gotten less, service has gotten slower, the place is just really not that great anymore and they're just overpriced.
* Chuck E. Cheese: Tolerable. I don't know what I was expecting, but I didn't find it special and I thought their crust was kind of gross.
* Dave & Buster's: I had it one time and I thought it tasted like I was eating at a gas station which, I mean, you can tolerate gas station food, but you don't want to go back.

# Ass

* Little Caesars: Little Caesars is ass, I'm sorry. The last couple times I've had it it has been atrocious. Imagine choking that down after a rough day.
* Cici’s Pizza: I can still remember this being the worst pizza I've ever eaten. It was like a buffet but all the pizza looked like it had been sitting out for hours, it was shit.
* Long John Silver's: When you eat fresh caught fish forever (me) and then you go somewhere like Long John Silvers and get fast food fish, it's not even the same meal.
* Applebee's: Applebee's tastes like microwaved garbage trash from my experience, it's horrible. If you actually go there and try to have an enjoyable meal, the service is also like the most garbage thing ever.
* Whataburger: It's fucking garbage. If you eat a cheeseburger drunk and it's bad, you know that shit is ass.
* Quiznos: Every single time my mom got it, I was fucking furious.
* IHOP: As my dad would say, that place could choke a flea.",0,1770965301.0,restaurant,3,0.17,False

1r3i5zy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3i5zy,Are These Tiny Manifestations or Am I Delusional!!,"&#x200B;

Okay guys I need to tell you something and you tell me if this is normal or if I’m just doing elite level pattern recognition 😭..

These are my tiny food “manifestations” lol.

so the first one:

My sister sent me a picture of white sauce pasta she made. We live in different cities so I couldn’t just go eat it. And in my house ordering food randomly is not really a thing. It’s kind of a luxury, not an everyday thing.

I saw that picture and I wanted it so bad. Like intensely.

Three hours later my dad randomly wins a quiz and gets invited to a restaurant with free food for the family. He calls me and asks what I want,I say white sauce pasta and I get it the same day...

Okay fine,Maybe coincidence.

Second one.

I once tasted a very specific dish from my friend’s lunchbox. I loved it and thought wow I wish mom would make this. But I never told her. I literally forgot about it.

Important detail. That dish had not been cooked in our house for eight to nine months...

Next morning, Sunday, she randomly says she’s making that exact dish for breakfast.I never mentioned it go her like Not even once,so i was like lowkey surprised😭

Now third one is the  burger story because this one is detailed....

In the morning I watched Jungkook’s live highlight where he was eating a burger, fries and drinking cold coffee(ig you all know which live I'm talking about lol😭)For eighteen whole minutes I was staring more at the burger than at him. Please don’t judge me. I just love burger 😭

Fast food at my house is not common, It’s like a luxury. So I was just quietly wanting it....

While he was eating fries with ketchup I literally thought nahh bro I don’t even like ketchup.... Jungkook bruh our choices are not same if i ever eat something I'd love to eat it without any sauce....

That same evening my uncle visited. We actually went out planning to eat street food but on the way it got late so our plan changed in the middle of the road and we went to a restaurant instead.

and coincidentally we went to the restaurant of which burgers are so famous and tasty he asked me what i want and i immediately said burger😭I was internally losing it.He asked if I wanted fries too. But at that moment I didn’t really feel like eating fries so I said no.

I ordered a Coke because that’s what I wanted then. After that he even asked if I wanted cold coffee...

Now here’s the very specific part.

When the food came, there was no ketchup on the table😭😭

Usually they automatically give ketchup with burgers and fries. My uncle even noticed and said hey they forgot to give ketchup.

And I just said it’s okay I don’t like ketchup anyway.

I had literally thought about not wanting ketchup in the morning while watching that live.

okay the last one,

One day I tried calling my dad to tell him I wanted something. He cut the call because he was busy, I forgot about it because yeah I've adhd😭,then i suddenly remembered it The next day that oh i wanted that to eat and then I was like never mind and The same night he came home with that exact thing. Something I hadn’t eaten in like four months...I never reminded him about that😭

So I just want to ask,

Are these just small food manifestations lol. Does this happen to you guys too. Or am I just connecting random dots because my brain likes patterns.

Because it’s not like I’m scripting or obsessing. I just want it strongly for a moment and then I let it go.

And then somehow it shows up.

Be honest. Am I magical or just good at noticing coincidences 😭..

*\*3:00AM PST Start / 6:00AM EST Start*



**Why This Pick?**

The rivalry between these two teams makes me think this will be a tough battle, friends – I fully expect goals to be at a premium here. At the time of writing, it looks like Jacob Markstrom will get the start in net for Sweden, and I’ve gotta be honest: he’s not my favourite (lol). I wouldn’t be surprised if Finland pulled off an upset here despite being a heavy underdog with Juuse Saros in their corner, but I do think this game stops long before a total of 5. My money’s on the Under to cash.

Was a tiny bit of a sweat there in the third quarter, but I'm glad the Lakers decided to haul ass in the last 7 minutes of the 4th!

I’ve recently started DJing—mostly Progressive, Organic, Tech, Deep House, and Afro—and I’m looking to actually get involved in the Islamabad scene.

The problem is, as a beginner, everything feels a bit ""gatekept"" or happens behind closed doors at farmhouses I don't have the pins for yet lol. I’m not looking for big gigs or anythingI just want to connect with the community.

I’m looking for:

* **The Crowd:** Where do the actual music lovers go? Not the ""posh party"" crowd, but people who actually care about the tracklist.
* **The DJs:** Any local DJs (bedroom or pro) down to grab a coffee and talk gear/transitions? I’d love to learn from those who’ve been doing this in the city.
* **The Spots:** Are there any low-key cafes or studios that host open decks or listening sessions?

I’m really just trying to move from my bedroom setup to the local scene and support other artists. If there are any WhatsApp groups or Discord servers for Isloo musicians/ravers, please let me know!

P.S. If anyone wants to jam or just exchange some tracks/playlists, I’m down. Peace!",1,1770964532.0,islamabad,1,1.0,False
