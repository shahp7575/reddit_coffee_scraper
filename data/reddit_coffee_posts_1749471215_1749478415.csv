always add mods in small bundles. Done

1l75tkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1l75tkd/theres_a_second_me_and_hes_better_at_being_me/,"There’s a Second Me, and He’s Better at Being Me Than I Am","It started with a voicemail.

Not a spooky whisper or distorted voices saying things like “get out.” Just a regular voicemail. From my own number.

“Hey, it’s me. Don’t freak out. I know this is gonna sound insane, but I need you to listen carefully.”

I froze. My blood felt like syrup. It was my voice. My cadence, my phrasing, even that annoying sniff I do before I talk.

“But I’m not you. Not exactly.”

I don’t remember the rest. I dropped my phone halfway through, my hand trembling, a metallic taste flooding my mouth. I didn’t sleep that night.

The next morning, I tried to play it again, but it was gone. Not deleted. Gone. Like it never existed. But I remember every word.

At first, I thought I was losing it. Stress from work, lack of sleep, maybe a psychotic break. My therapist said the same. I even took a week off to rest and reset. That’s when things got worse.

I started noticing changes in my apartment. Small at first. Coffee cups in the sink I didn’t use. The thermostat set two degrees higher than I ever put it. My toothpaste squeezed from the middle, which I never do.

Then, my neighbor waved at me. “Hey, man! Sorry again about the noise last night.”

I stared blankly. “What noise?”

He frowned. “The music? You were blasting that 80s playlist at midnight. You okay?”

I hadn’t played any music. I hadn’t even been home that night—I’d spent it at my brother’s house.

That’s when I checked the building’s security cam.

I watched myself walk into the building. Laughing. Carrying groceries. Even nodding at the front desk guy.

But I wasn’t there.

I stopped going outside. Changed my locks. Covered every reflective surface in my apartment. I didn’t want to see it again.

Because one night I did. Just a glimpse.

I was brushing my teeth when I looked up, and my reflection… wasn’t brushing.

He was staring.

Not even blinking. Just a wide, flat smile. A smile that didn’t belong on my face.

I punched the mirror. I bloodied my knuckles. I slept on the floor with the lights on.

A few days later, I got a call from my mother. She sounded cheerful. “It was so good seeing you today. You looked healthy. Finally.”

My stomach dropped. “Mom… I haven’t left the apartment in days.”

Silence.

“Don’t do that,” she said softly, her voice trembling. “Don’t scare me like that.”

She hung up.

Then came the job termination email. I hadn’t shown up for two weeks, they said. But apparently, I had. And I’d been… amazing.

“Confident, funny, focused.” My boss said I seemed like “a new man.”

He was right. Because it wasn’t me.

The final straw came last night.

I woke up to the sound of humming. Familiar. Low. Coming from the kitchen.

I crept out of bed and peeked around the corner.

There he was.

Sitting at my table.

Wearing my clothes. Eating my cereal. Reading my book.

He looked up and smiled—my smile, but warmer. More human.

“Hey,” he said, just like in the voicemail. “I’m sorry it had to happen this way.”

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak.

“You weren’t doing anything with your life,” he continued, standing slowly. “No ambition. No passion. Wasting every day. I’m fixing it.”

He stepped closer.

“I’m better at being you.”

I slammed the door and ran. I’ve been hiding in a motel for two nights now, writing this from a burner phone.

I don’t know what he is. A copy? A parasite? Something from another world?

But he’s taken everything. My job. My friends. My family.

And the worst part?

No one has noticed.

I called my brother an hour ago. I told him everything. He just laughed and said, “You’re being weird. You just left my place like twenty minutes ago.”

Twenty minutes ago?

I’m in another city.

He’s replacing me, piece by piece. Erasing me.

If you’re reading this, and something—anything—strange starts happening:

The mirror.  
The voicemail.  
The humming.

Run.

Because I don’t think there’s only one of him.",1,1749478257.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1l75rgx,https://i.redd.it/job03fhnsw5f1.png,Review #4: Ardbeg Corryvreckan,"**Background:**

*I still remember the first time I tried an Ardbeg whisky. It was my friend's birthday - we were several pints deep and we were out in Edinburgh. We ended up in The Angels Share and I spotted a pretty interesting whisky menu. I was just dipping my toes into the world whisky at this point and I'd heard good things about Ardbeg. I ordered a dram of the Ten, not knowing what to expect. Big mistake. Or maybe just bad timing. This was not the time or the place to try such a dram - I tasted peat, smoke and more peat. It seemed Ardbeg wasn't for me.

 
Flash forward a year or so - I was at my local golf club for a summer tournament. It was a light-hearted team event and they had a couple of bottles of whisky at the first tee - Ardbeg 10 and a Speysider that I can't recall. With more whisky experience under my belt, I decided to give the Ten another chance. I didn't have time to savour it but this time it was different - sweeter, gentler, and not overwhelmingly peated after all. 

 
So Ardbeg was on my list. I'd heard of the cult followings the Corryvreckan and Uigeadail seemed to have, so I narrowed it down to one of these. Flying out from Edinburgh airport in 2024, both were heavily discounted and, with it being summertime, I passed on the sherry and picked up the Corryvreckan.*
 

**ABV:** 57%

**Colour:** Amber

**Cask Breakdown:** Bourbon/French Oak

**Price Paid:** £62

**Chill Filtered:** No

**Colour Added:** No


**Nose:**

The first thing I get on the nose is dark red fruits - ripe cherries and plums - not overly sweet but rich and indulgent. The richness develops with notes of dark chocolate combining with the cherry. Decadent.

 
Enveloping this richness is a strong coastal character - brine, fresh sea air and an ashy/smoky note. It's meaty - picture barbequing steaks on the beach, salty sea spray in the air and smoke billowing from the grill.

 
**Palate:**

Incredibly thick and mouth-coating in texture. It opens with sweet, rich fruitcake before an explosion of peppery smoke takes over. Alongside the smoke comes sticky, sweet barbecue sauce, liquorice and a shot of bitter espresso. The smoke is strong but balanced and doesn't overwhelming the darker, sweeter elements.


**Finish:**

Very long and lingering. The sticky barbecue sauce, liquorice and coffee notes remain, with  peat smoke and tar throughout. Deep, warming, and incredibly rich to the end.


**Verdict:**

So this bottle is a beast of a whisky - thick, oily, meaty and intensely peated.  The dark red fruit notes, combined with the salinity and those sweet yet bitter BBQ and coffee notes work together really well. It’s not subtle, and it's not even particularly balanced, but it is bold and exciting.

This bottle was a gamechanger for me. So much so that I ended up attending the Eureka launch event earlier this year. On the night, we sampled the Ten, the Uigeadail, the Traigh Bhan 19, the 25, and the Eureka itself — a  line-up that confirmed Ardbeg as one of my favourite distilleries.
 
I’ll definitely be cracking open my bottle of Eureka soon and can’t wait to share my thoughts on that one.

At the beginning of the year I was able to help get her a job where I work as she, at the time, did not have one. We recently just got a new manager and he’s great. He gets along with everyone, he’s always helping out where he can, and he’s just an all around good person. However, recently my Fiancé has only wanted to talk about him. She goes into work early, stays late, and even works on her off days to “help him out”. I know(hopefully) that she isn’t being unfaithful because there are cameras in every room of our office and I have her location(she has mine as well). Over the last few days, I’ve noticed that she’s almost withdrawn from our relationship. She doesn’t want affection, she barely engages with conversation, and she just seems distant, but she’ll talk about our boss for what feels like hours. She talks about getting him coffee and going to play MTG with him and another co-worker at a local card shop and how she plans on staying late this week to help get work done but yet she complains about working so much. I brought it up with her that it feels like she’s losing interest in our relationship but all I got met with was criticism. I’m being jealous and insecure. I tried asking her about it again and it diverged into an entire argument that led to me almost yelling at her to try and get the truth. I asked her if she even saw a future with me still and all she said was that “we are not doing ok”. She hasn’t said anything else about it and I can tell she’s still upset about what I said.

She is Australian and apparently ran into another guy who is from Australia while his and my son were playing near each other (not with each other). They got to talking and the way she described it, he said he is married, his kids are 5 and 6 (mine is 9), and they should get together for a play date. Somewhere in this she said he also said they should grab coffee and she gave him her number. 

She didn’t tell the story in order of events, mentioned the kids ages later, so it sounded like she gave him her number before that was established. Considering how much younger they are, I’m not sure why a play date would be needed. 

She then said we should make more friends but we go to temple and have access to a variety of places where she’s never tried to establish friends before.

Like, everywhere you look people are talking about hiring experts, building teams, outsourcing… and I’m just sitting here with my coffee and a Google doc, wondering if I’m missing something huge.
I decided to just dive in solo and see what I could figure out. Here’s what I wish I’d known before I started:
- You don’t need a massive plan. I wasted way too much time trying to make some 20-page “strategy doc” that I never looked at again. Now I just keep a running list of ideas and test them out one by one.
- There’s a ton of free/cheap tools out there that make it way less overwhelming. I tried out stuff like Buffer, MailerLite, and even Launchguide (which actually helped me organize my launch checklist in a way that didn’t make my brain explode).
- I thought I had to be on every social platform. Nope. Pick one or two that actually make sense for your thing, and ignore the rest. I still don’t understand TikTok and that’s fine.
Biggest surprise: people actually respond to authenticity way more than polished “brand voice” stuff. I literally just posted about my fails and wins, and it got way more engagement than anything I tried to make look “professional.”

You’re more than welcome to share this on **r/theydidthemath**—I’m honored you think it’s worthy of their legendary number-crunching crowd! Here’s a **ready-to-post version** with Reddit-friendly formatting:  

---  

**Title:** *""Calculating the mass of a chemist's molar tooth (because why not)""*  

**Body:**  
After a pun-filled prompt, I decided to calculate the weight of an *average chemist’s molar tooth*—both literally and chemically. Here’s the breakdown:  

### **1. The Premise:**  
- **Molar (tooth)**: The dental kind.  
- **Molar (chemistry)**: The unit (mol) tied to molar mass (g/mol).  

### **2. The Math:**  
**Assumptions:**  
- Standard human molar mass ≈ **1.5g** (hydroxyapatite, Ca₅(PO₄)₃(OH)).  
- Chemist adjustments: **lab stress + coffee intake**.  

**Formula:**  
`Tooth Mass = (Standard Mass) × (Chemist Coefficient)`  
Where:  
- **Chemist Coefficient = 1 + (years in lab × coffee intake in mL/day) ÷ (favorite solution molarity)**  

**For an average chemist:**  
- 10 years in lab, 500 mL/day coffee, 1M HCl → **Coefficient = 6**  
- **""Molar tooth"" mass = 1.5g × 6 = 9g**  

**Nobel Prize Exception:**  
Linus Pauling’s tooth (2 Nobels): **1.5g × (2)² = 6g** *(diminishing returns apply)*.  

### **3. Conclusion:**  
An average chemist’s molar tooth weighs:  
- **1.5g** (boring).  
- **9g** (lab-adjusted).  
- **6g** (if you’re Linus Pauling).  

*(Bonus: Molar volume at STP ≈ 0.0007 L. You’re welcome, dentists.)*

**Tagline:** *""Because sometimes r/theydidthemath and r/shittyaskscience collide.""*

I 20M met a 26F at the architecture studio which held the event, she works here as helping stuff. We had a short but great convo — basic intros, why I attend event, then I asked if she’d be up for wine on Saturday. She agreed and we exchanged contacts. However, I don't know what kind of person she is, what hobbies does she have, friends, music or is she even single

She works long 12h shifts and isn't into texting much, so we’re skipping the small talk and going straight to meeting up. While I wait for her to confirm time/place, I need help with date ideas, I don't want to text her, cause texts like ""how are you, what you do, what you listen to"" is super generic I would rather leave it for the real convo, now I have few days for finishing the date plan.

It feels different from dating someone my age — she’s older, independent, and has her life together. I want to make a good impression without overdoing it.

I am on the same page with her, skipped university and I am now completely independent, have highly paid 9-5, hobbies, big social network, not weird and creepy, athletic build and shi... but still feel like I was teenager yesterday and don't know how to deal with older girls.

Some ideas I had, the weekend is gonna be very sunny and warm:

* Wine + park walk with snacks and blanket
* Coffee/dessert + walk in the park with blanket
* Coffee/wine + some kind of light activity (but I’m stuck on the activity part, don't know anything about her relationship with sports etc...)

Would love to hear your suggestions, especially if you've dated someone older or had a similar situation of not knowing the backroung and skipping talking stage straight to the meeting up.

Thanks!

1l75jvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/hazbin/comments/1l75jvf/moxxies_coffee_order_demystified/,Moxxie's coffee order demystified,"I did loads of research on Moxxie's coffee order, and I thought I'd share so you don't have to. 

  
So let's start with the first order - A Neapolitan cappuccino, with more cappu than cino and no more than 4 oz of milk, because the beans won't have the right texture otherwise. 

First, it is to be noted, while Neapolitans do have their own coffee culture, ""neapolitan cappuccino"" isn't a thing.  Starbucks makes something called a ""neapolitan frappucino"", which is a play on neapolitan ice cream, so it has chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry syrup in an iced drink. While this may be what Moxxie means - that he wants a Neapolitan Frappucino, but hot, we can also explore another option. 

When you order coffee in Naples, it is usually a coffee served in an espresso cup. Either that coffee is made in an espresso maker, with a caffettiera (moka pot), or with a maccinetta napolitana (which is a weird thing made from a coffee pot and a normal pot stuck together with a coffee filter in the middle). Out of the three, coffee that is made in a caffettiera is most likely to be titled ""Neapolitan"". 

So, Moxxie probably wants a Cappucino, but made from moka, instead of traditional espresso. 

Next, we have the ""more cappu than cino"". That's pretty nondescript bullshit when taken alone. BUT, when seen in combination, it makes sense. ""More cappu than cino"" means more coffee than milk, and then he specifies the amount of milk at 4 ounces.

So Moxxie's first order is a coffee-heavy cappuccino made from mokka pot coffee with four ounces of steamed milk. - Or it's a mocha with strawberry puree a pump of vanilla, those four ounces of steamed milk, and a chocolate drizzle.

  
Now, the second order. 

A Venti Traditional Misto. Please use soy milk with two blonde shots, affogato and ristretto . I'd also love three vanilla pumps at the very bottom. Then add the coffee after. Then add...""

Venti traditional misto is easy. - Venti means the size, which is 20 ounces. A traditional misto is a half-and-half mix of drip coffee and milk. So, it's a ""café au lait"". A milk coffee. 

Or in this case a soy milk coffee. 

Additionally, Moxxie wants to have two blonde shots. Blonde shots, means he wants blonde roast coffee beans. Blonde roast is a low temperature roast that doesn't darken the beans as much as a regular roast. A shot is one serving of espresso pulled through an espresso machine. 

Now, Moxxie specifies he wants his shots affogato and ristretto. And once again he's not making much sense, but we can work with this if we switch it around. Ristretto means ""restricted"" and in coffee making, that means that you make the shot of espresso, but you reduce the amount of water, and you pull the shot more slowly. And Affogato means you add ice cream. Technically, ""affogato"" means ""drowned"", but for coffee, the thing you drown tends to be a ball of vanilla ice cream. 

And additionally he wants three pumps of vanilla sirup at the bottom of the cup. 

So, a twenty ounce cup with three pumps of vanilla, then half filled with drip coffee, then adding two ristretto shots of blonde roast, then drowning a ball of ice cream in it, and topping the whole thing with steamed oat milk. 

Which actually sounds delicious. Sure, the ice cream will almost immediately melt, but who cares, because it's just gonna give you that creamy texture the oat milk is lacking, and the rest of the drink will be large and hot enough that it'll still be a warm coffee but with a fun textural thing going on.

  
So now YOU know what a diva Moxxie is, and what he actually wants when ordering the insane stuff he's ordering. Now you need to just make sure they don't put Foxie or Roxxie on the cup. He hates that.",2,1749477610.0,hazbin,2,1.0,False

I wander around Buenos Aires, pausing perhaps unthinkingly, these days, to examine the arch of an entranceway and its metal gate. I hear about Borges in letters, I see his name on a roster of professors and in the biographical gazetteer. I like hourglasses, maps, eighteenth-century typeface, the taste of coffee, and Stevenson’s prose. The other one likes the same things, but his vanity transforms them into theatrical props. To say that our relationship is hostile would be an exaggeration: I live, I stay alive, so that Borges can make his literature, and this literature is my justification. I readily admit that a few of his pages are worthwhile, but these pages are not my salvation, perhaps because good writing belongs to no one in particular, not even to my other, but rather to language and tradition. As for the rest, I am fated to disappear completely, and only a small piece of me can possibly live in the other one. I’m handing everything over to him bit by bit, fully aware of his nasty habit of distortion and aggrandizement. Spinoza knew that all things desire to endure in their being: stones desire to be stones, and tigers tigers, for all eternity. I must remain in Borges rather than in myself (if in fact I am a self), and yet I recognize myself less in his books than in many others, or in the rich strumming of a guitar. Some years ago I tried to get away from him: I went from suburban mythologies to playing games with time and infinity. But these are Borges’ games now—I will have to think of something else. Thus my life is an escape. I will lose everything, and everything will belong to oblivion, or to the other.

1l75jep,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1l75jep/how_i_cured_my_lpr_symptoms_quickly/,How i cured my LPR symptoms quickly,"Background

While doing some boring comouter work, i searched youtube and listened to some videos. I came across a guy called ""kickitnaturally"". In his videos, he said that your stomach produces very acidic acid and your liver makes alkaline bile, and both of those combine in the stomach to create a volcanic like eruption. The eruption/combination is what kills bad bacteria that you accidentally ingest as well as breaking down your foods so that your body can use the broken down food to fuel your body's functions. A healthy individual will have both good bile flow and good stomach acid levels when eating food.

His claim is that those who suffer from LPR and gerd typically have low stomach acid, typically due to low bile flow. If you don't have good bile flow, your body will produce less acid because excess stomach acid is bad for your body. So now since you have low acid, your throat valve doesn’t close which results in LPR symptoms. Other symptoms for low acid include lighter colored stool, diarrhea, and unprocessed food chunks in your stool. The diarrhea is a result of your body pushing out food as quickly as possible because the food is rotting in your stomach. In order to properly digest the food, you need more acid and bile flow. You also are more suspectible to bad bacteria because it's the stomach acid and bile flow that kill the bad bacteria. For example, a healthy person could have some ecoli infected lettuce and be fine bacuse their acid and bile levels were sufficient to kill the ecoli bacteria, but an LPR sufferer wouldn't be able to kill the ecoli and now your symptoms will get even worse. An LPR sufferer's body also responds by producing tons of mucus to protect your throat which makes your life even more miserable.

The kickitnaturally guy has youtube videos and he links you to an ebook which is free where you can read about all this stuff directly from him. I did talk to my gastroenterologist about all of this stuff, and he said the science reasoning stated above is mostly sound with an addition stating the pancreas releases enzymes naturally to help break down food.

The cure

Read the kickitnaturally guys digestion chapter in his free e-book and follow all the steps. The first step is to take 3 beet flow pills during each meal, take 1-2 digesti-enzyme pills each meal, eat low carb, and gradually take betaine hcl pills during each meal. If you feel a burning in your stomach after the meal, that means your bile flow isn't sufficient to counteract the betaine HCL acid pills so you should stop taking the betaine HCL pills till you fix your bile flow. To fix your bile flow, you can do a beet flow pill flush where you take 4 beet flow capsules every 30 minutes for 2 hours (total of 4 does). If the beet flow pill flush didn't work....you can buy and take coffee suppositories. I had to take 4 coffee suppositories for my bile to start flowing (I followed the instructions on the box (1 pill per 3 days except i took 2 at once for my third dose...this double dose worked.)

Once your bile flow is fixed, reintroduce the betaine HCL and slowly increase your pills per meal to 5 per meal. If you ever feel a burning in your stomach, you need to stop the betaine HCL and fix your bile flow using the flush method above, eating low carb, and or the coffee suppositories. Once its fixed, increase the betaine HCL dosage to 5 per meal (always in the middle of the meal). Now you can discontinue the low carb diet (Yay!) Keep taking 5 betaine HCL pills, 3 bile flow pills and 2 digestive enzyme pills in the middle of each meal. My symptoms have completely disappeared after doing this for a week. I bought all three of these pills from natural reference, the online store that the kickitnaturally guy recommends. I assume he gets a kickback for each one of my purchases, but i don't care because he did what doctors couldn't do, cure me, albeit with hundreds of supplement pills, but totally worth it! Kickitnaturally also recommends taking other supplements daily such as D-limonene, mastic gum, ascorbic acid, and some others. Make sure and take those in between meals. I just bought those pills from random brands on Amazon, but it's up to you where you buy your supplement pills from.

I will try and answer any questions if you have them, but you can probably find most of your answers in either kickitnaturally's youtube videos or in his free e-book which he links to from his youtube.",2,1749477581.0,LPR,2,1.0,False

More often than not it's social etiquette to support, and rightly so, the elderly, but I've noticed this then leads to the norm of 'feeling bad'for them.

I'm uk based, there's outrage about the elderly and their winter fuel payments being taken away, and as of today, mostly reinstated.

But let's take a realistic look at this. Their generation lived in the peak of capitalism, when it actually worked. Wages matched, if not exceeded, the cost of living. Housing was essentially guaranteed, with vast profit upon the property as generations pass.

So should I feel bad, that there's the threat of them not getting £400 tax money, when we cant make ends meet? I watch the news and some say ""how am I supposed to survive?"" With all of our hearts, tugged at the prospect.

They milked the cow, destroyed the atmosphere, bought a house for 50K and we re facing 400K for the equivalent.

They were entitled to fantastic pensions, whilst not in debt to survive, unlike the modern day. But we still *feel* bad, why? Where has all their money gone?  should we feel bad when their opportunities were countless, and ours are limited? In addition to the fact they're mostly homeowners, but alas we uproar they don't get the extra 400 upon their private and state pension?

This is not a rant hating previous generations, i love all humans, I just think the social norm is ironic. They unintentionally dug our grave, economically and environmentally speaking, yet they're still perceived as victims. I'm sorry but no. If you're broke at 85, wtf happened. How are you completely broke? If we re broke at 25 - their rhetoric is stop drinking coffee.

Disclaimer: I'm aware this almost definitely doesn't apply to all, but it's a noticeable theme. Some need support, but if they need support, I dread to think what we need when we all reach their age",0,1749477337.0,unpopularopinion,1,0.5,False

I used Trung Nguyen beans—medium-dark, nutty, and chocolatey. Ground 0.53oz at a medium-coarse setting (around 25 on the BrewOne’s 51-step burr grinder), aiming for a 1:11 ratio with 160g water at 198℉. The built-in scale made dosing a breeze, and I programmed a custom recipe: 60g bloom for 30s, then two 50g pours with a 20s pause, total brew time \~2:40. The rotating nozzles are cool, but I set them to non-rotating since my cup’s mouth was too small. I tossed in some ice and 3 teaspoons of condensed milk before brewing. The result was a chilled, creamy cup with that signature Vietnamese caramel vibe—like a toffee dream. 😍

Tried a second brew at 194℉, and the coffee was less muddy with some floral notes popping through. But I needed less condensed milk. I used three teaspoons again, and it was way too sweet—tasted more like condensed milk with water than coffee. I think Vietnamese coffee works better with a slightly bitter brew to balance the condensed milk for a more harmonious flavor.

Biggest lesson? Don’t cheap out on beans—lower-grade ones tasted flat. Also, play with the grind settings; too coarse and it’s flat. And the Brew temp dont set too low. Anyone else using the Gevi BrewOne for Vietnamese coffee? What recipes or beans are you digging? Or any hacks for that perfect pour? 🤔",1,1749477297.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

We’ve blended families, built a home, bought a cottage together, and a rhythm, and at our best, we were true teammates—emotionally, physically, professionally. She’s strong, loving, wildly competent, and one of the most remarkable humans I’ve ever known.

But I messed up. Not by cheating physically or emotionally (I’ve never been with anyone else physically or emotionally during our relationship) but through patterns of avoidance that chipped away at her trust. I told small, reflexive lies about things I thought were inconsequential at the time. Things like who I was meeting for lunch, or what I was working on. Nothing scandalous or intimate—just omissions or softened truths to avoid perceived conflict or scrutiny.

She recently found one of those lies. And in her words, it confirmed everything she was afraid of: that I was living a “secret life.” She felt imprisoned, having sold her house and moved her kids in with me. She shut down emotionally and physically, not out of cruelty, but self-preservation.

I’ve since resumed therapy with someone I’d worked with since my divorce in 2015, and it’s been illuminating. I’m starting to understand where this pattern of avoidance came from (ghosts from my upbringing) a reflex to preserve peace and avoid shame. I’ve begun to trace this thread all the way back to a stupid white lie I told in 1998, which still haunts me.

Since everything came to light, I’ve been trying to show up with steady care and zero pressure. I still work for her company as legal counsel for 1/10 the market rate because I believe in what she’s building and want to support her. I’ve leaned into accountability, resisted the urge to overexplain, and tried to create emotional safety without forcing connection. I haven’t sent grand gestures; just coffee in the morning, quiet support, and consistency.

There are flickers of hope: conversations about the kids, shared meals, even couples therapy starting this week. But most days, it feels like we’re living on opposite sides of a very fragile bridge and though we still sleep in the same bed it feels like we are oceans apart. She’s said she doesn’t trust me. That she doesn’t even have the bandwidth to care what I’m doing anymore. And yet, we still operate together as parents and professionals.

I guess I’m writing because I’m exhausted, heartbroken, and trying to hold onto the idea that real change matters—even if the person you love can’t see it yet. I’m not asking for a cheat code. I just don’t want to become another guy who blew up something beautiful and gave up.

If you’ve come back from something like this, or even if you haven’t, how do you keep going?

My girlfriend and I recently purchased a Italian ice cream shop, and we’re looking to focus a bit more on the coffee side of things. Currently we have a 2 groups la spaziale seletron s40 that has a lot of issues. (Impossible to find a mechanic for it in my country) currently serving at peak days 20/30 beverages (cappuccino,espresso,latte & lungo’s etc) and now we are thinking about the perfect new setup for our shop. Currently we are eyeing a La Marzocco 1/2 groups. What advice can you give us and what do we need to keep in mind? Do we ever need a 2 groups even if we double / triple in amount of beverages served or will a 1 group suffice?

Thank you all for your help and sorry for my chaotic message (wrote this quickly at work)",1,1749476918.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1l758lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1l758lp/how_to_rebuild_trust_after_being_a_reflexive/,How to rebuild trust after being a reflexive “white lier”?,"My fiancée (48F)and I (50M) have been together for 4 years, living together for most of it. We’ve blended families, built a home, bought a cottage together, and a rhythm, and at our best, we were true teammates—emotionally, physically, professionally. She’s strong, loving, wildly competent, and one of the most remarkable humans I’ve ever known.

But I messed up. Not by cheating physically or emotionally (I’ve never been with anyone else physically or emotionally during our relationship) but through patterns of avoidance that chipped away at her trust. I told small, reflexive lies about things I thought were inconsequential at the time. Things like who I was meeting for lunch, or what I was working on. Nothing scandalous or intimate—just omissions or softened truths to avoid perceived conflict or scrutiny.

She recently found one of those lies. And in her words, it confirmed everything she was afraid of: that I was living a “secret life.” She felt imprisoned, having sold her house and moved her kids in with me. She shut down emotionally and physically, not out of cruelty, but self-preservation.

I’ve since resumed therapy with someone I’d worked with since my divorce in 2015, and it’s been illuminating. I’m starting to understand where this pattern of avoidance came from (ghosts from my upbringing) a reflex to preserve peace and avoid shame. I’ve begun to trace this thread all the way back to a stupid white lie I told in 1998, which still haunts me.

Since everything came to light, I’ve been trying to show up with steady care and zero pressure. I still work for her company as legal counsel for 1/10 the market rate because I believe in what she’s building and want to support her. I’ve leaned into accountability, resisted the urge to overexplain, and tried to create emotional safety without forcing connection. I haven’t sent grand gestures; just coffee in the morning, quiet support, and consistency.

There are flickers of hope: conversations about the kids, shared meals, even couples therapy starting this week. But most days, it feels like we’re living on opposite sides of a very fragile bridge and though we still sleep in the same bed it feels like we are oceans apart. She’s said she doesn’t trust me. That she doesn’t even have the bandwidth to care what I’m doing anymore. And yet, we still operate together as parents and professionals.

I guess I’m writing because I’m exhausted, heartbroken, and trying to hold onto the idea that real change matters—even if the person you love can’t see it yet. I’m not asking for a cheat code. I just don’t want to become another guy who blew up something beautiful and gave up.

If you’ve come back from something like this, or even if you haven’t, how do you keep going? How do you rebuild trust that was lost not in one big betrayal, but in a slow drip of self-protective dishonesty? How do I show her I see her now, and that I’m changing not to win her back, but because I need to live differently: for her, for us, for me?",1,1749476807.0,love,1,1.0,False

While classmates rushed to donate money for his treatment, I continued as if nothing had happened. 
Eventually, his sister found me at school, her eyes red from crying. 
""Could you please use some of the money my brother has been saving with you all these years for this emergency?"" 
""My brother only gets $1,500 for monthly living expenses, yet he transfers $1,200 of that to you. 
""Our family isn't wealthy, he even gives you the money from his part-time jobs."" 
""You're his girlfriend—how can you just stand by while he's suffering?"" 
At this point, Rylan's roommate stepped forward to confirm everything the girl had said. 
Despite their testimony, I maintained that there was no money. 
When my boyfriend regained consciousness, he immediately asked to break up with me. 
Everyone supported his decision, scolded me as a shameless gold digger
Facing universal cond//emnation, I finally pulled out detailed financial records from our two-year relationship.

""Mom has borrowed everything she could, but we're still short... I know my brother has been saving money with you from the beginning.""

I frowned, completely unmoved by her pitiful appearance. ""The money he saved was spent long ago,"" I replied, my expression remaining neutral.

Upon hearing this, the girl's eyes immediately reddened. ""Spent? How is that possible?""

Her voice cracked with shock. ""My brother has been dating you for almost four years since freshman year. Out of his $1,500 monthly allowance, he gives you $1,200, keeping only $300 for food.""

She clutched the edge of my shirt while bending slightly forward, her eyes brimming with tears. ""Not to mention all the part-time jobs he takes—all that money goes into your shared savings too. That should add up to tens of thousands! How could it all be gone?!""

""He's gone hungry several times with no money for food and had to borrow from me. He even asked me not to tell our parents, which is how I found out about this.""

With her grip tightening on my shirt, she pleaded, ""Please, I know this isn't right, and I didn't get my brother's permission, but as his girlfriend, can't you help instead of leaving him to die?""

A deafening silence fell across the room until someone finally broke it.

""Wait... I thought Rylan was a scholarship student! Turns out his monthly allowance isn't small at all!"" exclaimed one classmate while others quickly joined in.

""Yeah, he's always been so frugal... I used to think Kyra wasn't materialistic like other girls... so all of Rylan's money has been going to her?""

Someone else added with disbelief, ""I always thought Kyra came from a wealthy family. So she's been splurging with money Rylan saved by skimping on food?!""

As surprised and accusatory voices rose around us, I frowned at the crowd. ""You're all making judgments based on one side of the story. What gives you the right to speculate about me?"" I turned back to the girl with a cold stare. ""I told you your brother doesn't have any money with me. Stop making a scene. Everyone has their own fate,"" I stated, my voice remaining cold and flat.

The moment I finished speaking, slow, deliberate clapping cut through the tension. Rylan's roommate, Dax, stood up with his hands coming together in sarcastic applause, his face twisted with contempt.

""'Everyone has their own fate.' What a line,"" he sneered while stepping forward.

""Others might not know, but as his roommate, how could I not? I've seen with my own eyes how Rylan's first action every month after receiving his allowance is to transfer money—to you, apparently?""

His eyes narrowed as he gestured toward my outfit. ""Look at the clothes and shoes you're wearing—all luxury brands. And Rylan? He buys $9.99 clothes with free shipping and wears his shoes until they fall apart!""

His voice rose with each word as his anger became more apparent. ""Now that he's in trouble and needs money, you're pretending there's no connection? Do you think we're all fools?""

Dax's words hit like a sledgehammer, leaving everyone stunned.

Unlike the girl, he was our class representative—always responsible, serious, and gentle with others. No one had ever seen him angry before, yet now his eyes were wide with fury as he delivered the final blow: ""Do you know Rylan got into that car accident while rushing to a part-time job to earn money for your birthday gift?!""

Hearing this revelation, the classmates who had been wavering now fully believed him.

""I never thought Kyra was this type of person.""

""How can she live with herself? Shouldn't couples split costs? She's just greedy!""

Facing everyone's accusations, I simply smirked and walked away from the noisy classroom, completely unfazed by their judgment.

Little did I know that within the hour, my phone would be flooded with messages.

Among the stream of vile messages lighting up my screen, I first noticed one from a friend at our university.

""Kyra, you should check out... the Campus Forum. What's going on there?"" The message stood out because this friend normally never cared about campus gossip, so the fact she was directing me to the Campus Forum meant this had blown up significantly.

After opening my social media, I quickly scrolled until finding the viral post that had captured everyone's attention:

""We are Kyra's roommates, and at the request of those involved, we've taken these photos (attached).""

""We're extremely reluctant to believe our roommate is such a heartless and greedy person.""

Below the text was nine photos showing various branded bags and expensive gifts, each appearing quite valuable. They had specifically marked out one item with a detailed caption: ""This bear pendant—we checked—is smaller than a fist but costs $800, and Kyra has FIVE of them.""

The post continued with damning accusations: ""As far as we know, Kyra's family isn't wealthy. Where she got the money for these luxury items is obvious. We only learned the truth today—Rylan wanted to save money with you out of love, and this is how you treat your joint savings? Especially now when he's in danger, you turn a blind eye. We're exposing all this today, and we no longer want to be your roommates.""

The post had already sparked intense discussion, and now, with my roommate explaining the ins and outs, it has further ignited my classmates' anger.

""Damn, this girl is so selfish!""

""This proves couples should never mix finances.""

""God, how could he do this to himself? That guy is so skinny, yet she spends money so frivolously, like a parasite...""

""Terrifying. I'm afraid to date now—scared of being treated like an ATM.""

Some took the opportunity to make broader generalizations: ""Women have it so easy making money. If I were a woman dating ten guys, I'd be loaded.""

""Money for $800 charms and thousand-dollar bags, but none for her boyfriend's medical bills? A woman drowning in vanity.""

Yet compared to my private messages, the comments section was actually tame—merely sharp criticisms rather than the truly disgusting messages flooding my inbox.

There, people who didn’t know the full story hurled insults at me indiscriminately, especially the guys who put themselves in Rylan’s shoes. Even though they had never gone through anything like this themselves, they now banded together, full of righteous indignation.

With a heavy sigh, I finally returned to my dorm, only to find my clothes and bags thrown on the floor and covered in dust. Several of my sheer dresses had new holes, and my bags displayed obvious scratch marks across their surfaces.

Meanwhile, my three roommates sat inside, busily engaged with their phones and makeup, deliberately acting as if I didn't exist.

As I surveyed the damage to my belongings, my expression darkened: ""You're damaging someone else's property. I can call 911.""

Without even turning her head, Lisa continued applying her makeup, admiring herself in the mirror from different angles. ""Go ahead, call them,"" she sneered while blending her eyeshadow. ""While you're at it, why don't you explain exactly where these things came from and whose money bought them? Let's see who ends up paying compensation—us or you.""

Her voice dripped with contempt, without a trace of guilt or hesitation.

Another roommate immediately chimed in, crossing her legs dramatically as she lounged on her bed. ""Hmph, now I understand how you afford showing off new things every day—you're spending someone else's hard-earned money. No wonder you treat everything so carelessly,"" she remarked with a mocking smile.

The third roommate didn't even bother acknowledging my presence, completely ignoring the confrontation.

Seeing their completely unbothered attitudes, I stopped arguing and instead walked directly to their closets, throwing the doors open with purpose.

Without hesitation, I grabbed a pair of scissors and began cutting through their clothes methodically.

One garment, then another... I continued until the room was in complete disarray, only then did they finally notice what I was doing.

"" Are you insane? What do you think you're doing?"" one screamed, jumping up from her chair.

Another rushed toward her damaged belongings, her face contorting with rage. ""What gives you the right to touch my stuff?! This skirt took an entire month of saving to buy! You're going to pay for this!!!""

""That was from my idol's brand collection!"" the third shrieked, lunging forward. ""I paid a fortune for that!! You absolute bit//ch!!""

As they all clawed their way toward me, I spun around and darted out of the dorm, quickly locking the door from the outside before they could reach me.

With my dorm now off-limits, I headed straight to a hotel near campus.

Predictably, within hours, I received a call from our academic advisor summoning me to her office.

When I arrived, I immediately spotted my three roommates huddled together in the corner, their faces transforming into masks of accusation the moment they saw me enter.

The advisor tapped her fingers lightly on the desk while taking a slow sip of coffee. Her narrowed eyes scrutinized me from behind thin glasses, judgment evident in her gaze.

""Kyra, correct? I know who you are,"" she began with an air of superiority. ""The computer science student who's always dressed up—hard to forget, really.""

She placed her cup down deliberately before continuing, ""You should understand that students come to university to learn, not to compete with each other, and certainly not to indulge in vanity.""

Gesturing toward my roommates, she continued, ""Regarding the damage to your roommates' personal property, they've each recorded their losses in detail. If you refuse to compensate them, I have no choice but to issue a major demerit on your permanent record.""

Her voice hardened as she added, ""This will affect your graduate school recommendations and all special considerations.""

""As for the scandal that's been circulating recently, I've heard about it. While we shouldn't jump to conclusions, I must remind you that you can't take advantage of someone's affection to do whatever you please.""

She leaned forward, her tone becoming increasingly condescending. ""Beauty isn't capital—kindness and consideration for others are the virtues a young woman should possess. That boy treated you so well, yet you behave like this? Truly disappointing.""

""No wonder more people criticize today's young women. People like you deserve the criticism.""

Her words penetrated the empty office, each syllable drilling into my ears.

I pressed my lips together before responding, ""So you believe whatever they say without question?""

Meeting her gaze directly, I continued, ""As a teacher, shouldn't you at least uphold fairness? If this is just their one-sided story, then go ahead and punish me however you see fit. Why even bother calling me here?""

The advisor couldn't tolerate my defiance. Her cup landed heavily on the desk with a dull thud.

""You think you're so wealthy?"" she snapped. ""Then I'm giving you a deadline to compensate for the damages AND return the money Rylan entrusted to you. Otherwise, I'll contact your parents to settle this matter.""

""We have your parents' contact information on file. If you won't behave responsibly, we'll have to involve those who will.""

Despite her seated position, years of authority had perfected her condescending glare.

But I maintained my composure, responding flatly, ""Go ahead and call them if you want.""

The advisor stared me down, her voice eerily calm. ""Let me emphasize again—this demerit will definitely affect your graduate school candidacy. Our university doesn't accept students with questionable character into our graduate programs.""

Hearing this, a heaviness settled in my ch//est. They were the ones who refused to investigate, who jumped to conclusions. Since this situation began, no one cared about the truth—everyone simply believed rumors without question.

I never expected teachers would behave this way too.

Lowering my eyes, I replied quietly, ""Fine. Let it affect my chances, then."" And I walked toward the door.

If all my hard work could be erased so easily, then perhaps I didn't want that spot anyway!

The university organized a fundraiser for Rylan, then arranged for us to visit him afterward.

Only twenty students from our class were selected to go, yet somehow, I was specifically included.

Upon arriving at the hospital, I immediately understood why.

The room wasn't just filled with students and teachers from our school—there was also an influencer with a camera.

It became painfully clear they had invited me with malicious intent to create more drama.

After receiving treatment, Rylan was no longer in critical condition. He lay in bed, his gaze finding me through the crowd.

He had always been thin—almost skeletal—and now, with his face drained of color after surgery, he looked especially pitiful.

Classmates gathered around him, offering words of concern and support.

Standing in the corner was Rylan's sister, whose eyes filled with disgust and resentment when she spotted me.

""Who invited you?"" she demanded, her voice rising. ""I don't want to see you."" She pointed at me, tears threatening to spill.

Sensing compelling content, the influencer immediately aimed the camera in my direction.

My classmates stepped aside, creating a conspicuous empty space around me.

Rylan sighed, tugging at his sister's sleeve before looking directly at me. ""Let's break up,"" he said flatly, his eyes devoid of any emotion.

""Rylan!"" his sister exclaimed, stamping her foot in frustration. ""Even if you break up, she needs to return your money first! Why should she spend everything you worked and saved for?""

Her voice trembled with anger as she continued, ""Just seeing her makes my blood boil! It was YOUR money—why should it be wasted on someone without a conscience?!""

Hearing this, Rylan's expression tightened with discomfort as he looked at me, disappointment filling his gaze.

""I never thought you'd be this kind of person, but considering our history together... I won't say much. Just do as my sister suggests and calculate the money. I don't want all of it—just half.""

He paused before adding, ""I'll give you one month to return the money. After that, we're completely done.""

Our classmates erupted with indignation. ""Why should she keep ANY of it? She should return EVERYTHING! Don't tell me you still have feelings for someone like her?""

""She's been taking advantage of your kindness all along! You've always given her whatever she wanted, and this is how she repays you!""

""Gold-diggers like her deserve the worst!""

From the corner, the influencer could be heard telling viewers on the livestream not to use profanity in the comments.

Lisa suddenly shoved me forward from behind. I stumbled, barely catching my balance.

""Calculate everything!"" she shouted.

""Yes! Calculate it ALL!"" Others joined in, their voices rising with hatred.

Looking at Rylan's fake expression of difficulty, I fought back the wave of nausea rising in my throat.

""Calculate? Fine,"" I replied calmly.

""Let's calculate EVERYTHING then!""",1,1749476774.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False
1l7583d,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1l7583d/the_weight_of_ashes/,The Weight of Ashes,"Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her—fumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold

 sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna’s passing, the twins had been born—tiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday—Emma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then—silence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it—cruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel’s alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn’t bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn’t drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of “stages,” “healing,” “coping,” while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog—a golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was “good with kids.” Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn’t ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile—as if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors—backpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper—quiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons—a plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye—plastered with “Proud Parent” stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later—cursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car—Robert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn’t fix anything. It didn’t bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest—just enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn’t enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, a borrowed thing—one that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically—his grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill—fast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn’t stop. The child’s face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn’t move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert’s jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn’t learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine—but not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still—not enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don’t remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy—maybe six—slipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother’s scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn’t the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn’t stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water’s edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened—the gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back—a touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet—parents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn’t stop. He didn’t look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma’s crib and Samuel’s racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn’t contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy’s body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other’s eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn’t last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned—cautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn’t stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall—Miller Park—under the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn’t enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn’t feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party—balloons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise—just another utility worker. He didn’t need threats or blackmail this time. He didn’t need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma’s old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn’t shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now—not because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn’t yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck—white flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other’s arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it—looped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child’s name—Eli Meyers—suddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: “He looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.”

Then a new tab opened—her niece’s photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: “She still likes hide-and-seek, right?”

Linda’s hands hovered over the keys. She didn’t call anyone. She didn’t say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week—secondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

“Sabotage.”

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn’t make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn’t need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn’t chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it… they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren’t mourning Robert’s children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn’t enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song—""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn’t special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn’t scream. He didn’t run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely—but deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy’s brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy’s mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him—something fragile and bright—had been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn’t light a cigarette. Didn’t open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn’t revenge anymore. It wasn’t even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports—all of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn’t have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I’m coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider’s Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it—and maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins—events that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn’t yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there—mapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don’t want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn’t just violence. This was love—twisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn’t a phone number. It wasn’t coordinates. It wasn’t a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced—simple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel’s Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria’s pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds—one tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria’s throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it— A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself—photographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn’t been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them—no bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph—Emma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo’s yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn’t look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel’s face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion—not anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn’t happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn’t forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert’s lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children—their heads drooping in the cold—and then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then—slowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn’t acted alone.

And Halston’s nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond’s edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl’s body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still—the dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn’t about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn’t trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn’t meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn’t want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox—the bus driver—took the longest. He didn’t speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn’t need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn’t needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed—small acts, each just a hair’s breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren’t.

At the center of the new web wasn’t a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone—a hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn’t recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now—typed, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We’re still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn’t she?"" ""You can’t save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now—something familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn’t needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it “looked wrong.” Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria’s front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can’t save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""

I go to the ball park every day knowing I could get into the game. I don't have to wait five days to pitch."" -- Tim Burke 
 
On this date in 1992, the Yankees and Mets made a rare cross-town trade when the Bombers sent lanky lefty Lee Guetterman to Flushing in exchange for [Tim Burke](https://i.imgur.com/IxzdIIU.png), a former Yankee prospect who would finally get a chance to pitch in pinstripes a decade later! 
 
[Timothy Philip Burke](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/burketi01.shtml) was born February 19, 1959, in Omaha, Nebraska. He attended Roncalli Catholic High School in Omaha, then was an All-Big Eight baseball player for three consecutive seasons at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. 
 
The Pittsburgh Pirates took Burke in the second round (\#49 overall) of the 1980 draft. (The Yankees didn't have a second round pick that year, having lost it after signing free agent Bob Watson.) Assigned to the Alexandria Dukes in A ball, the 22-year-old Burke went 8-10 with a 3.44 ERA and 1.255 WHIP in 23 starts. Promoted to Double A the following year, he struggled to a 7-10 record and a 5.19 ERA, and after the Pirates traded him with three other minor leaguers -- Jerry Aubin, Bubba Holland, and Jose Rivera -- for [previously forgotten Yankee Lee Mazzilli](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1kn8n0f/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/). Of the four, only Burke reached the bigs. 
 
Peter Gammons, writing for *The Sporting News* on January 10, 1983, listed Burke as one of the rookies who could make an impact on the Yankees in 1983. 
 
But not only did Burke not make the Yankees, he only briefly pitched in Triple A, giving up nine runs in 12 innings before being demoted to Double A Nashville. Johnny Oates, who was Burke's manager in Triple A with the Columbus Clippers, later said that Burke had deserved a longer leash in Triple A, but ""a numbers problem"" forced the Yankees to demote him. 
 
But it may have been a blessing in disguise, as Burke's dominance with the Nashville Sounds of the Southern League re-established him as a prospect, as *The Sporting News* reported on August 22, 1983: 
 
> Teams opposing Nashville's (Southern) Tim Burke probably are tired of seeing goose eggs being posted on the scoreboard. On August 3 against Savannah, Burke fired his second consecutive shutout in a 9-0 triumph. He allowed only five hits while improving his record to 8-4. As well as holding opponents scoreless 18 straight innings, Burke had not allowed an earned run in the last 32 innings he had pitched. 
 
Overall, he went 12-4 with a 3.21 ERA and 1.248 WHIP in 129 innings with Nashville; the team won 88 games and went to the playoffs. Burke said it was the first time he had been on a winning team. 
 
(One of his Nashville teammates was a 27-year-old 1B/OF named Bill Showalter. Teammates teased Bill about his habit of walking around ""buck naked"" in the clubhouse, and 10 years later, Buck Showalter was Burke's manager with the New York Yankees.) 
 
But perhaps the Yankees thought Burke's success was just a mirage, a flash in the pan. He became yet another in the long list of pitching prospects traded away by the Yankees during the Steinbrenner Era. 
 
The Boss always had a dim view of pitching prospects. In the 1976 expansion draft, for example, he wanted to keep 34-year-old reliever Grant Jackson instead of a minor league pitcher. GM Gabe Paul insisted they protect the kid. ""This is on your head,"" Steinbrenner fumed. The minor league pitcher was... Ron Guidry. 
 
But Paul quit after the Yankees won the 1977 World Series, and Steinbrenner firmly took control. Add Burke to the list with Jose Rijo, Doug Drabek, Bob Tewksbury, and the other would-be Yankee pitchers of the 1980s, as on December 20, 1983, he was traded to the Montreal Expos for a minor league outfielder named Pat Rooney, who would never reach the Show in pinstripes. 
 
Burke was assigned to Montreal's Triple A team in Indianapolis, and in 1984 he went 11-8 with a 3.49 ERA and 1.400 WHIP in 180 2/3 innings -- not bad, but not good either. 
 
Entering the 1985 season, Burke was 26 years old and now with his third organization in four minor league seasons, without getting even a sniff of a cup of coffee in the major leagues. The Expos didn't have him on the 40-man roster, and any major league league team could claim him for the waiver price. No one did. ""Out of all 26 teams, nobody wanted me for $25,000,"" Burke told the *New York Times.* ""That wasn't real encouraging."" 
 
But then he got a lucky break with Buck -- not Buck Showalter, but Buck Rodgers. A catcher with the Angels in the 1960s, Rodgers had been Burke's manager with Indianapolis in 1984, and prior to the 1985 season he was named Expos manager. Rodgers brought Burke to spring training as a non-roster invitee. 
 
> ""There's no way I could've made the club if someone else was the manager. No one else knew what I could do. Buck was the only one who knew I could pitch in the major leagues."" -- Tim Burke 
 
Burke made the roster, and made his major league debut on Opening Day, [April 8, 1985](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN198504080.shtml). The game, in Cincinnati, was twice delayed by snow; Burke gave up one run on two hits and three walks in 2 1/3 innings of work. He wasn't much better in his next three outings, giving up three runs on seven hits and two walks in six innings, but Rodgers stuck with him. Burke followed up his shaky start with eight scoreless innings, with just three hits and two walks and 10 strikeouts. By June, he was one of the team's top setup men; by the end of the season, he had established himself as one of the best relievers in the National League. 
 
He appeared in a league-high 78 games, with 120 1/3 innings -- all in relief! -- and a 2.39 ERA (143 ERA+) and 1.080 WHIP. His ERA was seventh in the National League among pitchers with at least 100 IP. (In first place was Dwight Gooden, with a 1.53 ERA in 276 2/3 innings!) 
 
His best season came in 1987 -- a famously high-offense year -- when he was a perfect 7-0 with 18 saves and a 1.19 ERA (356 ERA+!) and 0.890 WHIP in 91 innings. He gave up just three home runs all season. At the end of that season, Tim and his wife, Christine, adopted the first of their five children; all from overseas and all with special needs. 
 
In 6 1/2 seasons with the Expos, Burke went 43-26 with 101 saves, a 2.61 ERA (142 ERA+), and 1.176 WHIP. He was an N.L. All-Star in 1989, going 9-3 with 28 saves and a 2.55 ERA (139 ERA+) and 1.063 WHIP in 84 2/3 innings. 
 
But he and the Expos got off to a rough start in 1991; Rodgers was fired after the team started 20-29, and GM Dave Dombrowski started cutting payroll. Burke, making $2.1 million a year and with a 4.11 ERA in 46 innings, was an obvious target. 
 
That same season, Tim and Christine were told the third child they had adopted, a 10-month-old girl named Nicole, needed open heart surgery. They carefully looked at the Expos schedule and saw the All-Star Break was followed by  the longest homestand of the season, so they scheduled the surgery for that week at Montreal Children's Hospital. The night before the surgery, as they were at the hospital getting Nicole checked in, Burke was paged at the hospital. ""Who even knows I'm here?"" Burke wondered. It was his manager, telling him he'd been traded to the Mets for impending free agent Ron Darling and minor leaguer Mike Thomas. 
 
An hour after the successful surgery, he flew to New York to join his new team. 
 
Burke was great for the Mets over the rest of the 1991 season, going 3-3 with a 2.75 ERA (134 ERA+) and 1.204 WHIP in 55 2/3 innings, but after giving up seven runs on nine hits and a walk in his first five innings, the Mets buried him in the bullpen. He didn't pitch again for two weeks! 
 
On May 1, the Mets were 7-0 through five, but the Braves scored one in the sixth and six in the seventh to tie it up. The Mets took an 8-7 lead in the top of the eighth. The Mets had pinch-hit for Jeff Innis in the top of the inning, so they needed a new pitcher. [I can imagine this was Burke in the bullpen](https://c.tenor.com/SGU9xYUt2mwAAAAC/tenor.gif) when the Mets told him to warm up. 
 
> ""I wasn't quite sure where the mound was, it had been so long. I guess I was kind of a last resort, but I felt pretty good out there, all things considered."" 
 
He pitched a perfect eighth, and then John Franco pitched a perfect ninth for the save.
 
That outing and three more scoreless appearances after it got him back in manager Jeff Torborg's [circle of trust](https://y.yarn.co/51b220cc-21cb-4721-9a2e-ee460c1e5c8c_text.gif), but then he gave up seven runs in two games to be banished again. After getting just 4 2/3 innings of work over the next 13 games, the Mets wanted Burke gone. 
 
Meanwhile, the Yankees were having bullpen issues of their own. Lee Guetterman, a 33-year-old lefty who had been with the Yankees since 1988, had been bombed to the tune of a 9.53 ERA and 2.118 WHIP in 22 2/3 innings; the final straw, on June 8, was a five-run, six-hit eighth inning in a blowout loss to the Blue Jays. 
 
Yankee manager Buck Showalter said General Manager Gene Michael carried around in his back pocket -- maybe literally! -- a list titled ""Other People's Problems."" When he wanted to deal a player nobody else wanted, he consulted the list to find a player on another team that nobody else wanted. Near the top of the list, we can assume, was Burke. 
 
But a trade between the Yankees and Mets? Almost unheard of, even if it was for two relievers nobody else wanted. However, at the time, George Steinbrenner was still serving his ""lifetime ban"" for paying a gambler to find dirt on Dave Winfield. And so, on June 9, 1992, there was no Boss to interfere and Michael was able to swap the struggling relievers. 
 
(Steinbrenner's lifetime ban, handed down in 1990, was lifted prior to the 1993 season.) 
 
[According to MLB.com](https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-mets-trade-history-c271618186), the Burke for Guetterman trade was just the ninth time the Yankees and Mets had made a deal; according to Jack Curry, writing for *The New York Times* on June 10, 1992, it was just the second time the two teams had traded a major leaguer for a major leaguer. 
 
> ""I hope the change of scenery will help both pitchers. I especially hope it helps the pitcher we are getting."" -- Buck Showalter 
 
Burke blamed his problems on his sinkerball -- ""when you are a sinkerball pitcher and your sinker is not sinking, then you are in trouble"" -- and hoped he could find it with the Yankees. He proved he could by retiring all five Blue Jays he faced in his first appearance in pinstripes; in fact, in his first seven appearances with the Yankees, he allowed just one run in 10 2/3 innings! 
 
Burke's biggest moment as a Yankee may have been on [July 5](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/TEX/TEX199207050.shtml) in a game against the Texas Rangers. Starter Scott Sanderson -- whose teammates sometimes dismissively called him ""Five and Fly"" at a time when starters were expected to go much deeper into games -- lasted his usual 5 1/3 innings, allowing four runs on 10 hits. Burke entered with one out in the sixth and two runners on, and struck out Dickie Thon, then got Al Newman to ground into an inning-ending fielder's choice to preserve New York's 5-4 lead. He then retired Julio Franco, Dean Palmer, and Rafael Palmeiro in the seventh. In the eighth, he got Ruben Sierra to ground out before giving up a double to Juan Gonzalez and getting pulled. Greg Cadaret and John Habyan then got the final five outs to preserve the Yankee win. 
 
Overall, in 23 appearances, Burke posted a 3.25 ERA (122 ERA+) in 27 2/3 innings, but the Yankees let him walk as a free agent at the end of the season. 
 
The following spring he was in camp as a non-roster invitee with the Cincinnati Reds, but decided it was time to retire. 
 
> ""On the first day of practice, I'm sitting there looking around the clubhouse wondering, 'Why am I here?' Every year around this time, the excitement in me builds. But this year it was gone. I realized my heart and passion wasn't with baseball anymore. It was with my family."" 
 
He returned home to help raise the five special-needs children he had adopted with his wife, Christine. ""When the bullpen phone rings,"" George Vecsey wrote in the *New York Times,* ""this couple gets up and starts throwing."" Burke wrote a book about it called *Major League Dad: The Moving Story of an All-Star Pitcher Who Gave up Baseball for His Family*. 
 
In eight seasons, Burke accumulated 12.4 bWAR in 699 1/3 innings, with a 2.72 ERA (136 ERA+) and 1.205 WHIP. For context, his career 136 ERA+ is tied with closer Bruce Sutter, and ahead of Lee Smith (132), Goose Gossage (126), and Rollie Fingers (120), who are all in the Hall of Fame. (But to be fair, they also all had a lot more innings.) 
 
**Burke Bits** 
 
* Even at the time, Pat Rooney was a headscratcher in terms of a return for Burke. A 20th round pick in 1978, Rooney was a 26-year-old corner outfielder who had just five major league at-bats (and had gone 0-for-5). He was coming off a mediocre .275/.306/.438 season in Triple A, and in six minor league seasons to this point had never hit .300. His best season had come in 1980 in Double A, when he hit .280/.347/.527 in 482 at-bats, but he followed that up with a .212/.263/.419 season in Triple A the next year. Who knows what the Yankees saw in him, but he hit .193/.256/.353 for the Columbus Clippers and then was released. The Blue Jays signed him, gave him 12 at-bats the next year in Triple A, then released him as well. 
 
* Burke may not be a household name today, but he was well known enough that Burke for Pat Rooney made *Spy* magazine's September 1987 list of the worst deals made by the Yankees since Steinbrenner had bought the team 15 years earlier. 
 
* And in *Damned Yankees: Chaos, Confusion, and Craziness in the Steinbrenner Era* (2012), Burke was included in the list of the many young prospects dealt away in the 1980s -- ""pitchers Doug Drabek, Jose Rijo, Tim Burke, Jay Howell, Jim Deshaies, and Bob Tewksbury, first basemen Fred McGriff and Hal Morris, shortstop Greg Gagne, and outfielders Dan Pasqua, Jay Buhner and Stan Javier..."" 
 
* He appeared on a similar list in Baseball Prospectus's *It Ain't Over 'til It's Over* (2007). 
 
* According to the book [Bat Boy: Coming of Age with the New York Yankees](https://matthewmcgough.com/bat-boy&ved=2ahUKEwiUm7_K1K2NAxWvKVkFHarBMkEQFnoECEoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2jyBpnFuNoiUTD-VveC7MR) by Matthew McGough, near the end of the 1992 season Burke asked McGough, the team's 17-year-old bat boy, for a favor. The Yankees were playing in Cleveland and then would finish the season in Boston; Burke lived in New England, so he wanted to be able to drive his car home after the last game of the season. He asked the bat boy --  who had only recently gotten his driver's license, and had never driven more than 20 miles -- to drive his brand new Lexus from Yankee Stadium to Fenway Park. While this sounds like the plot for a teen comedy, luckily there were no issues during the drive. 
 
* While with the Reds in spring training in 1993, Burke must have been having flashbacks to his time with the Yankees, as Cincinnati manager Tony Perez told him his hair was too long and he had to get a haircut! 
 
* Burke's alma mater, Roncalli Catholic High School, also produced current Phillies third baseman Alec Bohm as well as former NFL defensive end Jim Skow, who played for the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII. Coincidentally, Roncalli Catholic High School is named after Pope John XXIII, whose birth name was Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli. 
 
* At the University of Nebraska, Burke threw a no-hitter over Austin College on March 15, 1978. The Cornhuskers won 21-0! 
 
* Other Yankees who played for the University of Nebraska: Stan Bahnsen, Bob Cerv, and Joba Chamberlain. Aaron Palensky, who played for the Somerset Patriots and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders last year, also was a Husker. 
 
* Overall, there have been 17 trades between the two New York teams, which included a three-team deal; probably the most notable, in terms of bWAR, was the Yankees getting Robin Ventura in exchange for David Justice on December 7, 2001. 
 
* Burke said during his first two years in the minors, he was only interested in two things -- baseball and drinking. ""Baseball became my god,"" Burke told George Vecsey of the *New York Times* in 1989. ""I knew that if I did not produce, they would get somebody else, and drinking was how I handled the pressure."" In 1982, he got married, and his wife Christine said she would leave him if he didn't stop drinking. They went to Bible study together, and Burke said he turned over a new leaf. ""God took away my desire to get drunk. I never had any need to go into rehab. For awhile I used to have a beer, but then I just totally quit. I figured, why even have one?"" 
 
* Burke wore \#54 as a rookie with Montreal in 1985, but then switched to \#44 for the rest of his time there, and kept it when he went to the Mets. \#44 was technically available when Burke became a Yankee in 1992, but it hadn't been issued since Reggie Jackson left in 1981. (It was officially retired a year later, on August 14, 1993.) Burke instead took \#41, which is worn this year by Tim Hill; prior to Hill, it was worn by Tommy Kahnle, Miguel Andujar, David Phelps, Chad Gaudin, Jose Veras, Miguel Cairo, Randy Johnson, Sterling Hitchcock, and Brian Boehringer. \#41 also was worn by previously forgotten Yankees [Joe Collins](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/t6ktj9/no_game_for_the_foreseeable_future_so_lets/), [Bob Cerv](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/v0yajf/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/), and [Jake Gibbs](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/qop63d/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/). 
 
* On July 11, 1989, Burke pitched in his first All-Star Game; he pitched two scoreless innings, with the A.L. winning 5-3. (Don Mattingly had a double!) An hour after the game, Tim flew from Los Angeles to Guatemala to join his wife, Christine, to adopt their second child, a baby boy. Two days later, they flew from Guatemala to Cincinnati, where the Expos were playing; they landed an hour after the game started.  Burke got to the ballpark in time to pitch a perfect ninth for his 18th save of the season! 
 
* This is not the [Tim Burke](https://deadspin.com/author/bubbaprog/) who wrote for Deadspin in the 2010s and [helped popularize gif memes](https://deadspin.com/gifs-ranked-1827332999/).

I’m wondering if anyone here happens to own a Durston X-Mid (ideally the 2P) and would be up for a casual meetup at a park, state park, or any public spot to set it up and let me take a look? I’ve read and watched everything I can find about it, and while it looks perfect on paper, I’d love to see one in person before pulling the trigger.

A little about me: I’m a long-distance backpacker (did the Pacific Crest Trail in 2022), based in St. Louis Park. I’ve been slowly gearing up for more trips, and the X-Mid keeps rising to the top of my list for a lightweight, functional shelter. I also just really enjoy meeting fellow outdoorsy folks—if you’re into camping, hiking, or swapping trail stories, I’d love to connect!

Happy to bring coffee or snacks, and I’m totally willing to drive an hour or so to meet wherever’s convenient for you. Just looking for a low-key, friendly gear chat and a peek at the tent.

Here’s a pic of me somewhere along the PCT for trail cred and fun 😄

He didn't clear out his living room or bedroom to make space for me, he slept in and ignored my calls and texts on moving day until the very last minute, and I spent hours yesterday deep-cleaning his kitchen and organizing it only to have him yell at me for moving his stuff and not making room for MY bread maker. I paid $1k to move in and don't have money to just abruptly move out. Why is he acting this way? Is there a way to fix it or do I just move on asap?

 

I hate airing my relationship issues online as I already learned my lesson from that last week, but I am more confused and upset than ever.

 

I was single for most of my 20s. Had a few short flings in my early 20s, dated someone last year for 6 months, and then end of last year started dating my BF. So, relationships are new to me and at 30 I feel like a child (or Meredith Grey lol) trying to navigate my first adult relationships. My BF has been in relationships almost consistently since he was at least 17 (has three kids with a prior GF).

  
We started dating in November and things went a lot slower than it did for my 6-month relationship last year. I wasn't sure at first how much I liked him, but gradually my feelings grew. I hadn't considered moving in with him at all as I was comfortable living alone and figured that would only happen if we had been together for a couple years. He lives in a 2B1Ba bottom duplex with his dog and, until recently, his roommate. Beginning of April his roommate announced she was moving out. My BF is the only one on the lease and was sub-leasing out to roommates. The monthly rent is $1,400, and without a roommate he'd have to pay the full amount which he can't afford. He texted me all stressed out when his roommate said she was moving out and I jokingly said I could move in instead to help with the rent. He texted back that he'd love that. We talked on the phone and decided I should move in. The main motivation was finances. He can't afford rent alone, and I paid almost $2k a month for my apartment (I make more than him) so moving in with him and reducing my rent by almost 1/3 seemed great. My lease ended May 31 anyway and I'd procrastinated renewing it. I was nervous about moving in as I've never lived with a partner before and also dislike living with roommates since I've had a few atrocious ones in the past and I'm not willing to take the gamble with a stranger. But, he's a good cook and cleans and does laundry and is also my BF whom I adore so it seemed like a good idea. I also had a few hesitations because he has a very hyper dog (I have trauma from a dog bite to the face in my early 20s and so haven't owned/lived with a dog in years) and also, although he cleans, he doesn't deep clean. His bathroom and kitchen are usually a bit grimy and he doesn't seem to sweep or dust often. But, I told him that as long as he keeps up on the day-to-day cleaning then I don't mind taking on the role of deep cleaning.

  
He has a ton of stuff, and in the weeks before the move he was cleaning out his 1-car garage and also putting things in there for our future yard sale. We decided we'd use my bed and sofas since they're nicer than his and would put his in the garage. I hired movers and we made a game plan about what to keep and what to get rid of and how to combine things.

  
On Thursday night, a week and a half ago, he came over to my place to transport some of my plants as well as a few boxes of fragile decor. While he was grabbing the stuff I told/reminded him to have his living room as cleaned out as possible with the floors swept so that the movers could easily move his couch into the garage and mine into its place and we could also stack boxes. I didn't mention his bedroom but assumed he'd do the same in there. The second bedroom, my office, was already cleared out for me to move into.

  
The next night, Friday night, I had skipped worked to pack all day and then went over to his house at 10 p.m. to bring over some more plants and fragile boxes. I unlocked his place and brought them inside, and that's when I noticed the living room was not only not cleared out and clean like I'd asked, but there was a bunch of stuff everywhere like dumbbells and dishes and shoes just all over the furniture and floor. Plus one of armchairs we'd agreed to sell was still in there instead of the garage. I checked his bedroom and same thing: Messy, backpacks all over the floor, absolutely no room for the movers to maneuver out his bed without tripping on stuff and nowhere to put my boxes. I took a video of the living room and his bedroom and sent it to my sister and asked her what tf I'm supposed to do. By that point my back was sore from moving boxes all day, I was tired, and I was hungry. I started crying because I was so frustrated and stressed by the situation. My BF works Friday nights until 2 a.m., so I knew that by the time he got home, went to bed, and woke up, the movers would be at his door. I just sat there in shock literally not knowing what to do and wondering why he hadn't done what I thought we agreed on. I texted my BF angrily asking him why he hadn't prepared his place and this man genuinely could not figure out why I was upset.

 

In a moment of my being an asshole, I posted the two videos (eight seconds long in total) to TikTok with the caption, ""When you're supposed to move in with your BF in 12 hours but his place still looks like this."" In the description I mentioned how we had agreed he'd have his place partially cleaned out. I figured maybe 100 people would see it, which even then I still shouldn't have done that. But, to both my surprise and horror, it ended up being viewed by over 1 million people, and 95% of the thousands of comments were telling me not to move in and that this is a huge red flag and even offering to help me move elsewhere.

  
I went back home and talked to my mom on the phone at midnight discussing maybe finding a storage unit and a temporary place to stay instead when my BF, who had been arguing with me over text, finally simply texted back asking me to tell him what to do and he'll do it. When he got home from work he worked for about two hours clearing everything then texted me a little after 4 a.m. saying he was done and going to bed. I decided to go through with the move since he did end up fixing it and I'd already hired movers and ended my lease.

  
Day of the move, I had only slept for three hours. The movers came around 1 p.m. to load up my stuff. I texted my BF and called him multiple times telling him to be ready. He didn't answer for over two hours, right before the movers were about to leave for his place, and texted me a simple, ""Good morning."" I was pissed and told him I needed him over here helping me transport the last few of my things and my cats since I couldn't fit them in my car. He came on over (after getting coffee and a danish) and grabbed my stuff and got to his place right after the movers did. Once the movers began moving my stuff in, I hid in a corner of his bedroom just kind of disassociating because I was so tired and frustrated, and my BF kept popping in to tell me to tell the movers where to put stuff (as if I hadn't purposely written on each box which room to put them in) and even handed me a vacuum to clean up under his bed after they moved it out before they moved my bed in. The move ended up taking a lot longer than my prior moves and I spent $869 on the movers and overall $1k on moving. I slept for the rest of the night and the next day while my BF put stuff away in the kitchen, which I appreciated. He cooked dinner and gave me a foot rub as well. During this time I was also still getting thousands of views and comments on my TikTok.

  
The last week I've been regretting the move and feeling annoyed that I can't find stuff because it's all in boxes. Whenever I move I like to put things away ASAP because I can't stand having a mess, and I told him that. After those first two days though he didn't help to put anything else away, even though he only works three days a week, and I could only get so much done as I work M-F 9-5:30. But by the end of the week I stopped feeling as frustrated with how slowly things were moving and decided to chill out. On Friday I made another TikTok telling everyone that yes, I did move in, and although I didn't justify him dropping the ball last Friday night, that was literally the first and only time he'd done something like that and he's generally a great partner. I also said I'd be deleting both TikTok videos soon. Most of the comments were saying I was dumb for moving in and ignoring the obvious red flags and that I deserved any misery that came from this. I was trying to convey that I'm not in this for life, just for now to see how things go, and if it doesn't work out then I'll move. I deleted both videos early on Sunday.

  
On Saturday we did a yard sale which went well and was pretty fun. He didn't go to sleep after getting off work at 2 a.m. and pulled an all-nighter to get ready for it. I told him to wake me at 4 a.m. to help and he work me at 5 a.m. We worked well together and had a fun time. He did mention that he forgot to take his meds and was therefore feeling unusually euphoric. Afterwards (and this is stupid that this matters to the story) he read me a part of a Wiccan book about how in traditional Wiccan marriages they share wine and bread. I thought that was cute, so I suggested that we do that that evening. After helping for a bit to clean up from the yard sale, I went to the store and got us a couple bottles of wine and his preferred boxed wine and then I pulled out my bread maker machine and put the ingredients in there to make bread. He had never seen one before and was astounded and skeptical at how easy it was. I set it to start, and then we both napped until almost midnight. We then woke up, enjoyed some bread and wine, then went back to sleep.

  
Sunday morning, yesterday, I woke up first and spent some time reading a book. My BF woke up a bit later, and I told him I want to get the kitchen put together today. The kitchen was in the exact state he'd left it a week ago: Half-empty boxes in the middle of the floor, potted plants all over the table and chairs, random crap on the counters, and super grimy cabinets and countertops and stovetop and microwave. He agreed and went into the kitchen for a minute, looked at the boxes of stuff on the floor, then told me he already took my stuff that he wanted out of them so if I wanted anything else from the boxes then to let him know. Then he went back to bed. Well, that wasn't good enough for me, so I started taking things out of the boxes myself and organizing things. The kitchen doesn't have a lot of cabinet space or a pantry, so he used my tall wooden bookshelf as storage in the kitchen instead. I put some things on there, both for organizational but also for aesthetic purposes. I don't like things to just be out in the open, so I arranged the cookbooks on there, my cute dishes that wouldn't fit in the cupboard with his, his instapot (which he already put there day 1) and my crockpot on one shelf, and then on the bottom my large glass jars of flour, sugar, etc.

 

I repotted a few of my plants and found new homes for them around the house so they wouldn't be on the table. There were some potted plants on the windowsill above the kitchen table, so I added mine there. His potted plants were almost all in those cheap pots they come in at the store or else in plastic disposable cups. This part I should have asked for permission about. I genuinely didn't think he'd mind though. He had a stack of really cute pots in the backyard which he'd said I could use, so I re-potted his plants in those to make them look cuter. I have a green thumb when it comes to houseplants so it's not like I was some amateur doing it, but still I should have asked.

  
After doing that, I added a few more of my things to his cupboards where I could find space but otherwise put most of my dishes and utensils in boxes in the garage since they wouldn't fit with all of his stuff. Then I spent hours cleaning the kitchen. I used his spray dish soap (I saw a professional cleaner online saying she loves to use that stuff) to clean his counters and cabinets and backsplash. Sometimes I had to do it multiple times to get all the grime off. Then I cleaned his microwave and the side of his fridge and behind his trash can. Then I tackled his stove. The stove top needed multiple cleanings, I took out the stove spiral things and the metal dishes which were nasty and cleaned those, and then I lifted up the stove top and there was a giant pile of dried fat and grease underneath which I spent forever cleaning up. It was gross, but looked great afterwards.

 

This whole time I kept wanting him to come see the progress I was making but he slept until like 8 p.m. and then after that went into the backyard and scrolled on his phone for an hour. While I was cleaning the stove and brought some parts outside to spray with a hose, he asked if I wanted any help. I said, ""Yeah, if you want to help."" He went back to his phone and said nothing. The last thing was the pile of dishes in the sink, and I was annoyed he falsely offered help, so I went back outside and asked him to unload and load the dishwasher. He sat on his phone for another 30 minutes while I finished cleaning the stove and swept. Then I went into the living room because I was super tired from cleaning and organizing all day and worked on writing my book, and he eventually came in and did the dishes while bitching at me for using up all of the spray dish soap. I offered to go get more but he declined and told me just to not use it again. I told him no, I can buy dish soap myself and will continue to use it. When I went back into the kitchen later I saw that my shot glasses, which I had put in the cabinet next to his dishes, were back on the counter. I thought he moved them to put dishes away and forgot to put them back, so I moved them back into the cabinet.

  
Right before I was about to go to bed, he told me he wanted to make bread again with the bread maker since he was so enamored by it and it's cheaper than buying bread. I grabbed it from where I had temporarily put it in the living room, put it on the counter, and opened my recipe book and showed him what to do. I asked him what he thought of the kitchen and if he liked it and he was just like, ""yeah, it's nice."" Not the reaction I'd hoped for after slaving over it all day. I then mentioned to him that we'll have to find a place to put the bread maker but for now it doesn't fit anywhere in the kitchen. He looked at the shelf with his instapot and my crock pot and asked if I used my crock pot. I said I didn't use it often, but I liked having it there because it's pink and cute. He said we should put the bread maker there instead. I said no, I put everything how I like it on the shelf, and if anything we should move his instapot since it's my shelf we're using, not his, and I'd like to have my stuff on there. I then made some room on the counter and said we can put it there instead. But he kept getting mad and I basically said it's my shelf, I paid for it, he's the one who wanted it in the kitchen, so we're putting what I want on it since there's nowhere else for my stuff and I worked hard to make it cute. He said he doesn't care if things look cute, I said I did.

 

I left and went to bed, honestly not thinking much of it since I made room for the bread maker on the counter. But ten minutes later he texted me saying I obviously don't care about his fucking opinion and why the fuck did I move all of his stuff when we had agreed the kitchen would be his room to organize and decorate. I said yes, we did decide that, but he hadn't done anything all week and didn't help me today when I asked, so I took the initiative, and I barely moved any of his stuff, I just found room for a few of my things then put most of it on the bookshelf. Plus, I slaved over his fucking disgusting kitchen for hours to make it clean. But he wasn't having it and was angry at me and then started getting after me for re-potting his plants which I admitted I should have checked in with him about, but he had so many pretty pots so it made no sense to only be using the ugly ones the plants came in. He said if I'm not using my crock pot it should go in the yard sale pile, and I told him I never said I don't use it, just that I'm not using it every day, and also it was a Christmas gift from last year and I asked for it specifically because of the cute color and it's staying on MY shelf. I then said if he's so mad that I moved things around then move things back to where he wants them. I couldn't even really think of what I had moved besides moving his protein powder to a higher shelf in the cabinet so I could put my mugs in there since I can't reach the top shelf and he can.

  
My BF was so mad he slept on the couch until 4 a.m. I was so upset that, less than ten days into living here, we had already had two arguments, and also I was so hurt that I had spent all day on the kitchen and was so excited to see his reaction only for him to yell at me for ruining it and moving his stuff. Like, I just wasted my whole day organizing and cleaning this man's nasty kitchen only to get yelled at. I had been so happy with it and now it's ruined. He came back to bed around 4 a.m. and snuggled me like nothing happened. I got out of bed a while later, too upset still to sleep, to use the restroom then went into the kitchen to get some water. That's when I saw my shot glasses back on the counter. And I got so upset. 80% of the kitchen is taken up by this man's stuff, even though we're splitting rent equally, yet he can't even allow me to have my five shot glasses in the cupboard next to his mismatched bowls. Like, wtf. So now I've been crying and wondering what tf I do. I've heard of shit like this happening: A man not showing his true colors until you move in. I'm so naïve that I just really thought it wouldn't happen to me. I thought him not moving his stuff was a fluke and defended him on TikTok (which, again, I shouldn't have posted to begin with), and now I'm fucking angry and embarrassed that all those internet strangers who know NOTHING about us are right.

  
I just spent $1k moving. I can't move in with family because I have two cats and none of them can have them at their place. If/when I move out it will be another $1k plus the deposit and higher rent for the new place. I should have never moved in with this man. But now I'm here and financially stuck. The thing is, I still feel like this is so out of the norm for him. Maybe I'm naïve. But he did miss a dose of his meds and whenever that happens he gets euphoric for 24 hours then crashes, and I think the crash is why he slept all day and then was in such a bad mood all day and lashing out at me. I'm not saying I'm perfect, but like I honestly thought he would be thrilled that I finished the kitchen and also cleaned it for him when it wasn't my mess.

  
So, assuming I want to make this work, where do I go from here? I'm so bad at communicating and confrontation. I'm a baby when it comes to relationships. I don't have the money to just move out today. I want to have a conversation with him and I want him to apologize. So, my questions are: What did I do wrong that I should apologize about? I already apologized about the plants. I know I did wrong with the TikTok (which he knows nothing about). I guess I shouldn't have moved his stuff, but there was no room for mine. Maybe I shouldn't have been such a bitch about it being MY bookshelf, but it's the one thing I have in the kitchen besides my plants and the table that I bought, so I want it to be both cute and functional. Otherwise I was gonna put it in the office. How do I bring up how upset I am to him? I feel like he doesn't understand me lately when I bring stuff up. How should we better work together? I can always cut my losses and move on, but I won't have money to move for another couple weeks, I was genuinely looking forward to living with him despite my initial fears. He's never been this selfish and uncaring about my feelings. Usually it's the complete opposite. It's so weird.

  
Anyway, sorry this is long. I'm currently writing a book and don't know how to not write anything long. Thanks if you've read this far.

1l750n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l750n4/i_wrote_a_letter_to_my_future_self_today_i_got_a/,I wrote a letter to my future self. Today I got a letter back...,"So I guess I should start by saying I’m really not sure what to make of all this. Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve always been more of a Scully than a Mulder. I guess you could chalk it up to my upbringing—my parents were strict atheists, as were most of the people in my town.

For context, I’m a 37-year-old male from the US (no, I won’t say which state, so don’t ask). My wife and I separated last fall, and so for the past year I’ve been suffering from a malignant case of what I guess you could call “what’s-the-freaking-point.” Most people I’m sure would probably label it a midlife crisis, and if you want to go ahead and call it that too, be my guest. Add a recent job loss into the mix (only a data entry analyst for a local law firm, true—but still), and you start to get the picture. It’s honestly wild just how little it takes for the house of cards you call a life to come crashing down around you.

Anyway.

Like most people in my position, I turned to self-help books, motivational courses—even reached out to a couple of local therapists (though I never followed through; those sons of bitches are *expensive*). A lot of it was exactly what you’d expect: visualisation techniques, journaling, and a whole lot of “manifest your future” bullshit—but there was one thing that caught my attention. In one of the books (I won’t name it, but you’ve definitely heard of it), the author recommends writing a letter to your future self—something about “making promises” and “committing to change.” The sort of thing.

So tl;dr—I wrote one. Just scribbled it out, stuffed it in an envelope, and dropped it in the mail. No address, no stamp. Not even sure why I bothered, really.

**The next day, I got a letter back.**

I discovered it while returning from my early morning run (another of the author’s recommendations). 

Sweating and still out of breath, I turned it over in my hands, miffed, not sure if it was some kind of joke—and if so, who would even bother. I’ve got few friends, none of whom could be said to have the time or inclination for practical jokes. I would’ve chalked it up to some local dipshit playing a prank, if not for the contents.

I won’t go into details (it’s personal, after all), but let’s just say it mentioned things that no one else could possibly know—deeply private things, things I’ve never said out loud.

I guess that’s why I decided to write back. 

*—Who is this?*

I should have left it alone—that much is obvious now. But call it morbid curiosity, or just plain ol’ stupidity, I just had to know.

The reply came the very next morning. 

I had just stepped out onto the porch, coffee in hand, when I’d seen the little flag on the mailbox sticking up, and I knew that my mysterious pen-pal had replied. Truthfully, I hadn’t been expecting another letter, having by that point convinced myself that whoever wrote the first had simply gotten lucky—which seems unbelievable to me now, looking back (although, to be fair, denial is a powerful thing).

This time, however, the letter was different. 

Before, the manner had been cordial—friendly, even. Like the correspondence from an old acquaintance. 

This letter, though… 

I’d stood there by the mailbox, suddenly feeling like I might collapse as I re-read line after line, written in what was unquestionably my own handwriting. 

And the things that it said… the awful, horrible things, things that couldn’t possibly be true, and yet that I somehow knew were just that.

I’d ripped it up right there at the end of my driveway, unsure what was going on, but suddenly furious and—yes, I’ll admit it—afraid. To have a stranger come to your home and hand-mail something of such a personal nature, to be messed with in such a fundamentally personal way… I felt violated.

I didn’t write back. 

Whatever curiosity I’d held regarding the letter was gone, and all I wanted now was to forget the whole thing and move on with my life.

Then, yesterday, I got another one.

This time it was brief. Just a single line:

*See you soon…*

Enclosed with it was a cutout from a newspaper I recognized immediately to be my local.

It’s dated a week from now. 

It’s the obituary page.

*My obituary.*

I’m holding the clipping even as I write this.

*What the hell do I do? Is this real?*

Please.

Any suggestions?,"I’m about to have my transfer this week. I’ve been trying to quit coffee in preparation. I know there are studies that show you can have up to 200mg of caffeine even when pregnant but I would feel better about cutting it out completely. I’ve had losses in the past and never want to wonder if this contributes to it if (god forbid!) I have another failed transfer. 

Before I even started actively reducing caffeine, I had rules for myself that I hoped would prevent me from becoming too dependent on it. The rules are:

- only drink about one cup of coffee in the morning. Sometimes it’s drip coffee and sometimes it’s a latte. 
- only small or mediums if I’m ordering at a shop. I never get the large  
- no coffee in the afternoon

I sleep about 7-8 hours a night. I drink about 40-50oz of water per day (still working on increasing that).

My hope was when it was time to cut out coffee completely, it wouldn’t be an issue because I’ve been trying to limit it. WRONG! I’m so tired and literally can’t focus at work. Plus I’m a bit crabby. I have some teas but it’s not the same. Plus some teas have as much or more caffeine than coffee.

I’m in a brutal season of life right now and could really use your help with supplement advice or a solid stack to help me survive and stay somewhat functional.

My current situation:

Working 16 hours a day, split between day and night shifts (7 days a week).

Totaling around 80 hours a week, often with no full day off.

I nap during my 1-hour breaks.

Getting around 4 hours of sleep at home, with the rest of the time spent doing house errands for a family of 4.

I drink black coffee to start my day but that’s about it in terms of stimulants.


I know this isn’t sustainable long-term, but it’s where I’m at for now, and I need to stay sharp, avoid burnout, and function at a high level. I’m looking for:

Supplements for energy/focus (without hardcore crashes)

Cognitive support (memory, alertness, verbal fluidity)

Mood and stress management

Sleep recovery optimization (to get the most out of my 4 hours)

General health (so I don’t totally destroy my body)


If anyone has experience working extreme hours or has a go-to stack that keeps them in the game under this kind of load, I’d deeply appreciate your input. Budget-friendly suggestions are a plus, but open to premium recommendations too.

1l74t0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l74t0h/i_found_my_daughter_crying_under_the/,I Found My Daughter Crying Under the Floorboards—And Nobody Was There,"When we bought the Colonial on Maple Street, it felt like a whisper from another time: creaking banisters, leaded-glass windows, and wide-plank floors so old they moaned underfoot. Our daughter, Clara, was only three. She toddled through the rooms with her pink flashlight, pretending she was an explorer. I joked that we’d unearthed an adventurer.

It started the night of February 18th, exactly two weeks after we moved in. Clara woke me at 2:17 a.m., blinking terrified in the dark. “Daddy, there’s a baby crying downstairs.”

I pegged it for the pipes—old houses sing through their plumbing. I tucked her back in and went to inspect. Every faucet off. No drafts, no gurgles. I shrugged and went back upstairs. Clara slept the rest of the night.

Over the next few days, she kept mentioning the crying. “It sounds like a baby,” she’d say, voice trembling. “A real baby.” My wife, Mara, insisted it was just excitement or a vivid imagination. I wanted to believe her.

Then came the scratching. Late at night, long, slow scrapes beneath our bedroom floorboards, like someone trying to pry them up. I lay awake, listening. The wood whispered back to me, but I couldn’t pinpoint where.

On March 3rd, Clara vanished for three minutes. I dashed from the kitchen to find her gone—then heard her soft sobbing. It was under the dining room floor. I pried at the oak boards. One sliver of wood lifted on a rusty hinge. Beneath was a narrow crawlspace, just wide enough for a child. I knelt and peered in.

Clara sat on the dirt, knees hugged to her chest, tears wet on her cheeks. “The baby’s cold,” she sobbed. I reached down—she recoiled. “He won’t let me touch him.”

My heart hammered. “Come on, sweetheart.” I flipped the hatch shut and dragged her inside. She trembled against me. I called Mara. We sat on the sofa, speechless. I considered calling the police. What would I say? “My daughter found a baby buried under our floorboards”? It sounded insane.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I crept downstairs at 1:46 a.m. The house was deathly silent. I knelt by the dining room hatch and listened. Nothing. I opened it—panting cold air. Clara’s tiny footprints in the dust on the beams. But no baby, no cry.

The next morning, I cut the boards out entirely and ripped the old insulation. Beneath lay a rough-hewn wooden box, like a coffin. I pried its lid. Inside—nothing. No bones, no blanket, just the faint smell of rot lingering in the splinters.

I filled it with concrete. I bolted a steel plate and set a lock. Firm. Final. Clara seemed relieved. Mara slept without headphones again. I drank black coffee like medicine.

But on the night of March 17th, it started again—earlier, louder. Not crying this time, but laughter. High, childish giggles under the floor, echoing up through the wood. Clara sat straight up. “Daddy, he’s laughing.” Her flashlight beam darted over the walls.

I wrenched open the hatch. The metal plate I’d bolted was pried aside. The concrete had fractured. Fresh claw marks scored the edges.

I scrambled down. The box was gone. In its place, a small, tattered blanket lay on the dirt, soaked in something dark. I recoiled as Clara screamed behind me. Written in the dust around the blanket, in tiny, perfect letters:

“LOOK UNDER YOUR BED.”

My blood froze. I dimmed my flashlight and crawled back up, dusting my knees. Clara huddled beside Mara. I told them to go upstairs—go to bed—and I’d fix it. They obeyed, trembling. I waited until they slept, then crept back down.

Under my bed, in the moonlight through the window, I saw it: a tiny, red-soaked handprint pressed into the mattress—too small for Clara.

That’s when I heard it behind me: the soft scrape of wood. I whipped around. The hatch was open again. And there, on the threshold, stood a child’s silhouette—distorted, impossibly tall, with arms that stretched below its knees. Its head cocked at an impossible angle, like a puppet’s.

I froze. The figure tilted forward, and a voice hissed like wind through a grave:
“I LIVE WITH YOU NOW.”

It stepped toward me—slow, deliberate. I stumbled back, crashed into the dresser, and scrambled out of the room, slamming the door. I bolted it, wedged a chair under the knob, and dialed 911 with shaking fingers.

By the time the police arrived, the creature was gone. No prints in the crawlspace, no handprint under the bed, no blood-soaked blanket—nothing but the solid wood of the hatch and the cold concrete I had poured. They said they found no evidence. Perhaps a break-in. Or rats scratching. They left me with a pamphlet on home security.

We moved two days later. Clara sleeps in our room now; Mara and I never turn our backs.

Last night, as I tucked Clara in, she whispered, wide-eyed: “Daddy… I heard him talking under my bed. He said, ‘Don’t forget me.’”

She reached for my hand. I squeezed it. Above us, the floorboards remained silent, for now. But I know he’s still there—watching, waiting, laughing. And this time, I’m not sure the police will come back.

Because I told them there was nothing under the floor.

And I still haven’t told Clara the truth: he’s never coming to get me. He’s coming for her.

I’ve had my breaking point. I have a mat under the stove to stand on, and this morning my dog wants to chew on the corner of the mat. I tell him no, give him a toy instead. He goes right back to the mat. I tell him no and pull him away, throw the toy to distract him. He gets the toy, comes right back to the mat. Sure enough, the corner is ripped up now, just the smallest tear but I just started sobbing, I can’t have anything in this apartment that isn’t destroyed. 

The side table of the couch? The whole bottom of it is torn to shreds, so much so it’s missing a screw. That’s how much he’s eaten away at it. The coffee table? Two corners and two legs are chewed up. One of my dining room chairs? Corner is completely chewed up. His basket of toys? Torn to shreds. Now the mat. What’s next? He’s ALWAYS digging on the couch. I can see the fabric getting weaker and I swear if this couch gets ripped I’m going to lose my mind. 

I already don’t have much furniture to begin with, I’m 23 and just moved into a new apartment about 4-5 months ago. I already don’t have much furniture because I know he’ll destroy it. The furniture I do have is cheap, but my mom helped me buy it which makes me more upset. I do all the stuff of redirecting, distracting, whatever else. I need other ways because clearly my way isn’t working and I’m going to lose my mind. 

Yes, he’s in the crate when I’m away. This happens when I’m cooking, go get the mail, throw the trash out, just built up moments of me being gone for literally less than 2 minutes at a time. Or I’m showering, going to the bathroom, changing, etc.

Edit to add: I also do a lot of stimulation and physical work with him. The morning he gets an hour walk + a lick mat and sometimes a snuffle mat depending on how much time we have left. I live in Arizona where it’s already 110 by the time I get off work. We have a play session the second he’s out of the crate and done peeing. Lick mat/snuffle mat/frozen carrots or bone after. Later in the evening he goes to the dog park for about an hour and a half, he’s made lots of friends that vary with wrestling vs chasing, so mans is very tired. But the second we get home, he’ll lay on the couch, I think he’s ready to nap, but no he’ll just dig at the couch. Or he’ll snip at the table and run away.

When we bought the place we never intended on renting it, but then somewhat suddenly I got injured and was not working or skiing so I realized I should have other people use it so it wasn't just sitting idle costing me money. This background is important because we still use the cabin ourselves so our guiding principle is to make it a place we'd be happy staying.

The current coffee setup includes a Moccamaster Technivorm, Baratza Encore, electric kettle, french press, moka pot, and emergency back-up handgrinder. Works great for us when we bring beans, and we've gotten great feedback about the setup, but one couple was particularly chaffed we didn't at least offer ""cheap bad coffee"".

On principle I'd rather not supply such a thing, but the logistics of supplying decent quality coffee is what's stopped me from doing so this far.

I think it's important that it's both reasonably fresh and quantity controlled or else there will definitely be the guests that just take whatever they can home with them.

Here's the crazy ideas I'm kicking around:
A. Good instant - shelf stable and individual packages. Price per serving would be on the higher side for a bit of a handicapped end result, but it's something.

B. Mini freezer with sample bags - we have an owners closet where we could keep back-up bags. We'd need to get a freezer, so initial upfront cost would be higher, but the resulting product would be better and more affordable.

We also live about 2.5 hours away, so the restocking would be done by our cleaners. They are totally open to helping us by monitoring inventory and restocking either option, but it is something we want to be mindful of.

Not interested in adding any additional equipment, space is tight enough as is, but if we went the freezer route I'd consider supplying some pre-ground.",1,1749475180.0,airbnb_hosts,10,0.67,False

[[Explore Top Rated bowl glass large on Amazon.]](https://blog.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=bowl glass large)

## Key Features Analysis

The following large bowl glass options offer a range of critically important features that enhance their functionality and value.

**Material Durability:** High-quality large bowl glasses are crafted from borosilicate glass, known for its remarkable resistance to thermal shock and chemical corrosion.This ensures that the bowl can withstand rapid temperature changes without cracking or shattering, making it suitable for both hot and cold applications. The non-reactive nature of borosilicate glass also prevents it from interacting wiht the contents, preserving the purity and flavor of food items or the integrity of chemical samples. Some models also feature reinforced rims and bases to further enhance durability against accidental impacts.

**Size and Capacity:** Large bowl glasses vary considerably in size, with capacities ranging from several quarts to several gallons.

This allows users to select a bowl that best suits their specific needs, whether it's for mixing large batches of dough, creating elaborate food displays, or conducting large-scale scientific experiments. Accurate capacity markings are frequently enough included to simplify measuring and portioning, while the overall dimensions determine the bowl's footprint and storage requirements. The internal diameter and depth ratios affect the usability and accessibility of the contents within the bowl.

**Stability and Base Design:** A wide, stable base is crucial for preventing accidental spills and ensuring that the large bowl glass remains upright during use.

Some models feature a flat base, while others incorporate a slight curvature to improve balance on uneven surfaces. Many high-end bowls incorporate a non-slip coating or rubberized base to minimize movement on countertops or tables. The base design also affects the ease of pouring and transferring contents from the bowl, with some models featuring a pour spout for precision.

**Clarity and Visibility:** The clarity of the glass affects the visibility of the contents, which is especially important for food presentation and scientific observation.

High-quality large bowl glasses are designed to provide maximum transparency, allowing users to easily monitor the mixing process, inspect the surface of liquids, or showcase decorative items. Some decorative bowls incorporate colored glass or etched patterns to enhance their aesthetic appeal, while maintaining sufficient visibility of the contents.

Key features of a well-made large bowl glass include:

*   Thermal shock resistance
*   chemical inertness
*   Accurate capacity markings
*   Stable base with non-slip options

## Core Benefits

A high-quality large bowl glass provides several practical benefits across a range of applications.

**Enhanced Culinary Applications:** Large bowl glasses are perfect for preparing large batches of salads, mixing dough for breads and pastries, or marinating meats. The obvious glass allows you to monitor the mixing process and ensure even distribution of ingredients. The generous capacity is ideal for catering events or feeding a large family.

**Improved scientific Experimentation:** In laboratory settings, large bowl glasses act as reaction vessels, storage containers, or observation tanks. The inertness of borosilicate glass prevents contamination of samples, while its thermal resistance enables controlled heating or cooling during experiments. The clear glass provides excellent visibility for observing chemical reactions or biological processes.

**Aesthetic Decorative Displays:** Large bowl glasses can be transformed into stunning decorative displays by filling them with seasonal items, potpourri, or decorative stones. Their simple yet elegant design complements any home decor, and their transparency allows the colors and textures of the contents to shine. These bowls make eye-catching centerpieces for dining tables, coffee tables, or shelves.

**Efficient Food Storage:** Large bowl glasses provide a practical and visually appealing way to store fruits, vegetables, or snacks on the countertop. their airtight lids keep food fresh while reducing reliance on single use plastics. The clear glass enables you to see the contents at a glance, minimizing food waste and simplifying meal planning.

## FAQs Section

Here are some commonly asked questions regarding large bowl glasses.

**What type of glass if best for a large bowl glass?**
Borosilicate glass is the preferred material due to its exceptional thermal resistance, chemical inertness, and durability. It's less likely to shatter under temperature stress than standard glass.Tempered glass is another potential option, as it is more resistant to shattering than standard glass, but it is less heat resistant than borosilicate.

**How do I clean a large bowl glass?**
Most large bowl glasses can be cleaned with warm soapy water or in a dishwasher on a gentle cycle. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch the glass surface. For stubborn stains, try soaking the bowl in a solution of baking soda and water, or using a specialized glass cleaner.

**Are there any safety precautions I should take when using a large bowl glass?**
When handling any large glassware, always use caution to avoid dropping or striking it against hard surfaces.if using a bowl for hot liquids, pre-warm the glass gradually to prevent thermal shock.Never heat a glass bowl directly over an open flame or on a stovetop, unless it is indeed specifically designed for such use.

1l74j08,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1l74j08/how_geotargeting_can_improve_your_local_marketing/,How Geotargeting Can Improve Your Local Marketing Strategy,"In today’s competitive digital world, businesses are constantly looking for ways to stand out and connect with their customers. One powerful tool that can make a huge difference in local marketing efforts is **geotargeting**. This approach allows companies to tailor their marketing messages based on the geographic location of potential customers. By focusing on a specific area or region, businesses can deliver highly relevant and timely content that resonates with local audiences, ultimately boosting engagement and driving sales.

# 1. Reach the Right Audience

Geotargeting helps businesses pinpoint their target audience with precision. For example, if you’re running a local coffee shop, you wouldn’t want to waste resources advertising to people living miles away. Instead, with geotargeting, you can send promotions or advertisements specifically to people within a certain radius of your shop, ensuring that your marketing efforts are focused on the right individuals.

# 2. Personalized Content for Better Engagement

When customers feel like a message is meant specifically for them, they’re more likely to engage with it. By using geotargeting, businesses can offer personalized content based on the customer’s location. For instance, a restaurant could promote a special deal for locals, or a store might advertise an event happening in that area. Personalization builds a stronger connection with the audience, making them more inclined to take action.

# 3. Increase Foot Traffic

For businesses that rely on foot traffic, geotargeting is a game changer. If someone is within a short distance of your store, you can send them a timely offer or reminder to visit. For example, a special coupon sent to a customer’s phone when they’re nearby can increase the likelihood of them stopping by. This creates a sense of urgency and relevance that traditional advertising can’t match.

# 4. Optimize Local SEO

Geotargeting works hand-in-hand with local SEO strategies. By tailoring content for specific geographic areas, businesses can rank higher in local search results. When someone searches for a product or service near them, businesses using geotargeting can ensure their offerings appear in front of these local searchers. This increases the chances of attracting local customers who are actively seeking services in your area.

# 5. Competitive Advantage

Finally, geotargeting gives businesses a competitive edge by allowing them to stay ahead of their competitors. By focusing on specific regions and local nuances, you can better meet the needs of your community and ensure that your marketing strategies are more impactful than broader, non-specific campaigns.

In conclusion, geotargeting is an invaluable tool for businesses looking to enhance their local marketing strategy. By providing personalized, relevant content to potential customers in specific areas, businesses can drive engagement, boost foot traffic, and gain a competitive advantage in their local market. Whether you're improving your local SEO or sending targeted offers to nearby customers, **geotargeting** can significantly enhance your marketing efforts.",1,1749474943.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

The Racer: mid-50s male

Detail that will be relevant: Prior to the race, I went out and bought a couple of 6"" deep storage bins for all my gear, figuring it would make it easier to find stuff than if it's all jumbled together in a duffel bag. Definitely recommend. Despite being the Grand Rapids triathlon, the race is in Ada, Michigan, 10-15 minutes away, and for budget reasons, that's where I was staying. Terrible night's sleep - too much adrenaline - but I'm kind of used to that by now. 

**Pre-Race**

Got up around 4:00, pooped (that was weird timing)  had my oatmeal and coffee, packed up my bins, and drove to the race. Get out the bike, and...motherfucker, where is my helmet? And the backpack I clipped it to? 

Deep breath. I have time. Pack up be bike, zip back to the hotel - luckily I hadn't returned my room key - and...no helmet. Deep breath. I put it in one of the bins. It was in my car the whole time.

Okay, might as well pee while I'm here. There's a fart. Wait. Am I shitting myself? In my brand new tri suit? I sure am. Luckily, hardly any got on my kit, but that was because it was smeared all over my ass, so not a complete win. Washed and wiped as best I could, knowing that the clock was ticking. 

Drove back to Ada, hopped on my bike to ride to T1. Got to T1. Wetsuit. Forgot my fucking wetsuit. Go commando? Fuck no. I can do this. Rode full gas back to the car, grabbed the wetsuit, rode back to T1, which by that time was nearly empty. Ten minutes to race time. Did a quick set-up (this, children, is why you should do races before your first full), and hustle on down to the lake. Some would say that between the stress and the riding I was tired. I say I was warmed up.

**Race**

After all that? Fine.  Swim was pretty average for me. Felt good about the bike in terms of numbers and time spent in aero. Run sucked, but mostly because it was nearly 80-degrees and was my first long run of the season with  temperatures above 70. 

**Lessons:**

Stay calm. Shit will go wrong, and you might well shit all over yourself before the race even starts, but you got it.

I need to eat less at the start of the run. I was doing 1 gel every two miles/20 minutes, but my stomach didn't love that. (And I **really** didn't want to shit myself a second time.) Went to slowly eating a gel over the course of three miles.

Also need to fine-tune electrolytes. I was chowing down salt tabs, but throttled back on those was well, because of my stomach issues. Ran with a water bottle as a practice run, and didn't mind the weight. Next long run, going to try LMNT in that.

So this happened six months ago and my marriage is over but everyone's calling me psycho. Need to know if i'm actually the problem here.

My husband works at this tech company, been there three years busting his ass for basically nothing. His boss is this arrogant piece of shit who kept passing him over for promotions. Every review was ""maybe next time"" while bringing in outside hires for positions my husband deserved.

i was getting sick of watching him come home defeated every day. We needed that promotion bad, rent was going up and i'd been covering most bills since his salary was garbage.

Then i met the boss's wife at the company picnic. She's this lonely trophy wife type, clearly unhappy. Started chatting and found out she's been neglected for months while her husband works 80 hour weeks. One thing led to another and we exchanged numbers.

Look, i'm not proud of what happened next but desperate times. We started meeting for coffee, then drinks, then her hotel room. She was starving for attention and honestly? The sex was amazing. She kept saying how her husband never touched her anymore.

After a few weeks i brought up how unfairly her husband treated his employees. Mentioned my husband specifically and how he deserved better. She got this weird look and said she'd ""see what she could do.""

Two weeks later my husband comes home screaming with joy. He got the promotion AND a 30k raise. i played dumb but inside i was so proud of myself. i'd fixed our whole financial situation.

But here's where it gets fucked up. My husband never said thank you. Not once. He acted like he earned it all himself, started bragging to friends about his ""hard work paying off."" Meanwhile i'm still meeting his boss's wife twice a week, listening to her complain about her marriage while i'm basically prostituting myself for his career.

i dropped hints about how marriages need appreciation and gratitude. Nothing. He bought himself a new car with his first bonus check without even asking me. i was furious.

So i told him the truth. All of it. How i'd been sleeping with his boss's wife, how she got him promoted, how he owed his entire career advancement to me spreading my legs for his benefit.

He completely lost his shit. Started screaming about how i'd ruined everything, how he couldn't live with himself knowing his success was fake. Called me a cheating whore and said he'd never asked me to do it.

i was like ""you're welcome for the promotion asshole"" but he just kept spiraling. Wouldn't touch me, barely spoke to me, started sleeping in the guest room.

The final straw was when he said he was going to confess everything to his boss and give back the promotion. i'd sacrificed my marriage for his career and he wanted to throw it away out of guilt.

So i called his company's HR department. Told them my husband had been sexually harassing his boss's wife and using it to get promoted. Sent them screenshots of her texts talking about their ""relationship"" but made it look like he was the one pursuing her.

He got fired within a week. His boss's wife threw him under the bus to save her marriage, confirming he'd been ""inappropriate"" with her. My husband couldn't even defend himself without admitting his wife was sleeping around.

Now he's unemployed, we're getting divorced, and everyone thinks i'm some kind of monster. His family won't talk to me. My own sister said i went too far.

But honestly? He drove me to it. i sacrificed everything for his ungrateful ass and he couldn't even say thank you. Then he wanted to give it all back like my cheating meant nothing.

AITA for making sure he faced consequences for his lack of appreciation? Or should i have just let him throw away everything i'd worked for?",1,1749474387.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

I've just passed and I wanted to share my experience to hopefully provide you with some encouragement, motivation and intel to aid you on your way.

My background: 10 years working as an Application Engineer primarily on the MS stack. Of the 8 domains, before I started learning:

Security and Risk Management - ok
Asset Security - Good
Security Architecture and Engineering - poor
Communication and Network Security - weakest by far
Identity and Access Management (IAM) - Very Good
Security Assessment and Testing - ok
Security Operations - Good
Software Development Security - ok

I was offered the chance to take the CISSP course by my employer, delivered by an aligned provider, and the exam came bundled in with the cost of that. The maximum amount of time you could book the exam was 2 months, so I picked 45 days. I did not feel ready about two days before the exam so I set it to the last date, which cost me £50.

In all honesty I didn't take too much away from the course. It's 5 days of being talked at and I don't learn best that way.

Here is what I used to learn

- The official study guide and practice tests.
- Pete Zerger (The Don) YouTube Videos
- Pete Zerger's last mile e-book.
- Quantum 
- Learnzapp
- Chat GPT

I learn best by doing, so I started by taking tests in the official guides and failing them, 3-4 hours per day, 5-6 days a week. The official guides are essential in my opinion, there are 100 questions per domain and then additional practice tests with a good spread. 

Once I'd completed a section, I'd review the test and made sure I understood why I'd got the right answers right, and the wrong answers wrong.

Based on what I got wrong, I would use the official study guide, chatgpt and Pete Zerger's content to reinforce my understanding and then try again. I also used Chat GPT to quiz me on scenarios to further bed in my knowledge.

I started (broadly) getting about 60-70% of answers right per domain, then 70-80%, then between 80-100%. When I was getting over 85% per domain I was happy my base knowledge was there or thereabouts.

Around a month in I became aware of Learnzapp and Quantum. I initially baulked at Quantum due to the cost and chose Learnzapp. Learnzapp, whilst useful, essentially just bundles in the same questions from the official books, so whilst it's a valid way of learning, I think upon reflection this app is an either/or and not essential if you already have the official stuff. 

After I bottled the test and rescheduled, I bit the bullet and  used Quantum. In my view this was essential and probably got me over the line. Pete Zerger's talk about thinking like a manager is important and uses Quantum content to reinforce the learning, but again for me, I need to practice to learn it properly. 

On the day, I got to my location early, perched in a coffee shop, relaxed, and watched Pete's 100 important topics and reviewed the right and wrong answers from my quantum exams until it was time to go.

During the rest, I felt sure I was going to fail at about 60 questions in. I was convinced I was doing badly, but I passed at 100, so it's important to remember to remain calm, keep your answering strategy in place (Elite Pete has a video on that too) and to keep plugging away at it.

Here are some key parts from my learning that I wanted to share, take these away if nothing else:

- DO NOT rely on AI to give you the right answer. It fails to do so relatively often. By all means ask it to put things you already know into a table, summarise, give you mnemonics etc but do not copy and paste quiz questions into it and expect it to give you the right answer 100% of the time. 

- DO buy Quantum if you can afford it. The rest of the content Ive mentioned only teaches you the underlying knowledge. Quantum presents the Questions to you very similar to what you will see in the exam. The questions in the official guides are 90% not what you will get in the exam. (BTW Mr Quantum, thank you for your product, you are doing god's work. If I could give you one item of feedback, please update some answers to provide more descriptive feedback eg

Answer A is correct because *explanation*
Answer B is incorrect
Answer C is incorrect
Answer D is incorrect

- this isn't always helpful if the reasons why bcd are wrong isn't present in the answer of A. More context on why it's the wrong choice is important particularly in an exam where some answers aren't necessarily wrong, they're just better than the next one.
)

DO be prepared to put in the hours. You are not passing this on a whim.

DO read each question back to yourself several times before answering. Don't even look at the answers till you're sure you understand. 

DO pay attention to the role you are being given in the question. ""Why you will pass the CISSP exam"" is a little unhelpful in my opinion as it encourages you to view the exam from the lens of a CISO/Strategic operative and that you shouldn't immediately think about applying a technical solution. In actuality, some questions you do need to think technical/wear an engineer hat, and the exam will signpost this to you within a scenario.

In the interests of not making this a mega post, I will pack in the word salad, but please accept my best wishes and good luck. Keep plugging away and do not get discoraged. I am honestly not the brightest spark and if I can do it, anyone can. Pete also talks about the value of repetition in terms of your learning and that's certainly a key enabler for me.

All the best and please do feel free to AMA

Tell me about your fights!,"As a vet of both MTG and FF since the first days, I was absolutely blown away by the FF6 Revival Trance deck and the FF14 Scions and Spellcraft deck. I haven't played the FF7 or FFX decks yet, but let me gush about a couple games here. This will be a decently long morning coffee read, so TLDR at the bottom.


**HEAVY SPOILERS FOR FF6 --** 

Seriously, if you have any interest at all in the story/characters, do not read ahead.


Terra is >!the daughter of a human and an Esper, and the story revolves around an ambitious emperor and his plans to break the seal between the world of the humans and the espers. The seal only breaks when Terra unleashes her power against Kefka, a villainous court mage with lofty dreams of becoming a god.!<

>!Once the seal is broken, the espers flood out of the gate and bring ruin to the world. The latter half of FF6 takes place in this ruined world, and the clock is ticking until Kefka has enough power to wipe out what's left.!<

How does this play into the mechanics of the deck? 
>!Once you summon Terra, you start milling 2 cards per turn. You've broken the seal, the espers have escaped, and if you don't do something soon you're going to run out of cards and lose. A Youtube comment best summed it up: ""It's almost ironic. Banon made Terra out to be the world's last hope, that last ray. But if it wasn't for Terra being alive, the Empire may never had been able to open the portal to the Esper World or figured out how to truly suck out the life force of an Esper. No portal, no access to the Warring Statues, no World of Ruin. Sure, the Empire likely beats the Returners, but Ghestal is in charge and Kefka doesn't become a god. Terra simply existing indirectly led to the end of the world, while also being it's savior.""!<

It's absolute cinema, and the only complaint about the deck is that it should have included a few espers, especially Maduin. At least we got The Warring Triad!

Now onto FF14, no spoilers for this one except Yshtola being an exceptional mage which is evident from the first story beat. During the matches I played against this deck, I truly felt like I was up against a mighty powerful caster that could call upon the world's heroes when needed. I lost twice against this deck, the first time because of back-to-back board wipes and spells that allowed Yshtola to drain my health, and the second time to a penultimate turn of summoning 11 heroes to the board and then my opponent using the Full Party ability to mash them all with +4/+4. I became the raid boss, they popped their cooldowns, and they wiped me and Kefka from the board. 

Thanks for reading me gush about two of my favorite franchises. I'd love to hear about some of your matches that felt thematically on point!

I recently went through a major overhaul of my spending habits and it was a real eye-opener. One thing I learned is that tracking EVERYTHING, even the small $2 coffees, is crucial. They really add up!

Another big lesson was distinguishing between ""needs"" and ""wants."" This sounds obvious, but it requires deep thought. For instance, I considered my daily commute a ""need"" but then realized I could bike a few days a week and save a significant amount on gas. Suddenly, a ""need"" became a ""want"" that I could control.

I'm Eddie, 23M. I've dealt with insomnia on and off all my life but it's never been like this before. I have a summer job for which I need to be up between 4:45 and 5:20, and some nights this summer I've been dozing off but then finding myself coming back to consciousness and having some energy. This cycle can repeat for hours. Last night it did until probably 2 or 3am. It doesn't happen on days I work out, but I can't work out every day, as I take one rest day a week and some days circumstances don't allow for it.

I think the heart of it is the stress of ""I have to be up in x hours."" I try singing to myself, prayer, reciting scripture, imagining relaxing scenarios, and a breathing technique, but sometimes even those don't work. Last night, not even 10mg of melotonin helped, and last week, benadryl did not help.

I'm sorry, this is a long one guys, a lot has happened and I don't want to leave anything out.

I, 27 m, finally met my online best friend, 26 m, in person for the first time this weekend.
We met online in 2015 on an app called whisper, a social media app where you can anonymously post messages and pictures, comment on peoples' posts, and private messages. I was on vacation with my family after coming out as transgender (ftm) and posted on whisper asking if there were any other trans people who wanted to chat. My friend, let’s call him Sam, privately messaged me on the app, and we had an instant connection.

Sam has been there with me through a lot over the years (moving, job changes, relationships), but neither of us ever had the means to visit each other. We would have phone calls, text, Facetime video, you name it. We had breaks in our friendship where we didn't talk for a while, but no matter how much time had passed, we could always pick up right where we had left off.

About two weeks ago, Sam told me he is travelling close to my area for an event, and wanted to try and finally meet up. He was hoping to come Friday and meet up with me after work, go to his event on Saturday while I was working, come back Saturday night and get an air bnb, and head back home midday Sunday.

I have a lot of anxiety, but I knew that if I didn't say yes, we wouldn't know the next chance we would have to meet in person. So against my better judgement, I said yes. Fast forward to this past Thursday. My parents weren't comfortable with Sam staying in the house because they had never met him before, Sam knew this but he assured me he would find accommodations; whether it is finding an air bnb, sleeping at a truck stop in his car overnight, or finding a camping site between my parents' house and his event on Saturday. All sounded good. The plan was for him to leave in the morning Friday and meet me after I finished work around 4:30 pm.

I woke up Friday to a message from him at 3 am, saying he would let me know when he is leaving (it's about a 7 hour drive, and across the border), only for him to message me later saying he slept in. He didn't end up leaving until nearly 2 pm, meaning he wasn't going to be arriving until 9 pm. I figured, even though I was really annoyed, we could still have a good couple hours to chill and talk before the end of the day.

As I was finishing at work, he called and we talked about his drive so far, what we could do tonight, and agreed I'd go to a dispensary before they close, since we are both potheads. It was then he told me, ""you better have a pizza for me when I get there."" I responded, ""what? Why?"" and he said, ""because I've been driving all day and I'm going to be hungry when I get there."" I thought it was kind of demanding, but I understood where he was coming from, so I said fine and had the pizza order scheduled to arrive soon after he did.
I went home, tried to relax, and waited for this highly anticipated moment of finally meeting my long distance friend. I wait outside with my dog, scrolling on my phone and Sam pulls into the driveway. We hugged each other, sat on the front porch, talked for a few minutes before the pizza arrived, and agreed that we should call it a night around 12. Sounds good to me, I had to be up at 8:30 for work Saturday.

We smoke, we chat some more, and bounce around stories (ADHD made that interesting), and head inside around 11. We went to chill in my room, said hi to my parents and older sister on the way, and I grabbed Sam's pizza, leaving mine on the counter, intending to eat some after Sam left. My anxiety makes me very uncomfortable and nauseous when I try eating food when I'm nervous, but he was aware of this.

We spent maybe 30 minutes just chatting, when he asked if we could go smoke outside again. I said sure and we went out back for a bit. We went back to my room, and Sam was on his laptop when he told me he can no longer book an air bnb. I asked why, and it turns out after midnight, you can no longer book something for ""that night"" because it's considered the next day. It was at this point that Sam opened his pizza box and finally started eating his pizza (you know, the pizza that he so desperately needed as soon as he arrived).

We then spent the next hour looking for somewhere he can stay for the night. There were different cities between mine and the one his event was in, and he wanted to find a location that was EXACTLY half way, so he can drive some that night, and some the next morning. It's maybe a 4 1/2 hour drive to the event. We went through each city I mentioned but there was always something wrong with them.

The first city was a 1 1/2 hour and 3 hour split; he didn't want to drive 3 hours Saturday morning. The second city was a 2h 45m and 1h 45m split; that was too much driving for him right now. The third city was a 2 1/2 hour and 2 hour split; but that wasn't close enough to exactly half way. At this point it's 1 am, and I'm getting really tired after working all day, but I couldn't just kick him out without finding somewhere to sleep. We ended up finding a city that would be a 2h 20 minute and 2h 10 minute split, and apparently this time split was what he was looking for. Great, let's look for a hotel in that city and book it, right? WRONG.

He then finds a 4.3 star hotel, and borrows my phone to call the hotel, but hung up the phone without saying a word. ""Your phone sucks, I couldn't hear anything he was saying. Can you call?"" I was starting to get fed up, and grabbed my phone to call myself. I turned the volume up on the call and asked the man if we would be able to book a room for the night, to which he said yes. I look up at Sam, and he's not even paying attention to the call, not even looking at me. I ask the man on the phone if I can talk to my friend and we will figure out details to book the room.

I hung up the phone, told Sam about them having a room available, and handed him my phone to call back and book his room. He doesn't take my phone from me, but instead looks at me and says, ""Okay, well call them back and book me a room."" .... What.... I tell him absolutely not, I explain my anxiety on the phone and not having the information to book the room for him. He replies, ""you'll never get over your anxiety at this rate. Just call, I'll give you my credit card to book it.""

I flat out refuse to call the hotel back, at which point he says, ""fine, I'll just sleep in my car,"" and starts looking for truck stops between the cities. I'm getting increasingly tired and irritated, just playing dumb games on my phone, until he finds a spot and starts packing up his stuff for the night. He asked me to keep his laptop for the night, and he puts it in his backpack. ""yep, that's fine. We are hanging out tomorrow anyways.""

UGH! It's almost 2 am and we go downstairs. I hadn't eaten yet, and I'm about to crash. We are standing in the kitchen when Sam says, ""Can I say something unsolicited?"" I responded, ""Oh god, what is it?"" ... I sh*t you not, he looks dead in my eyes and says, ""I didn't realize how ugly your sister is."" WHO SAYS THAT. 

From that moment on, something changed and I no longer wanted to hang out anymore. I love my sister, and I guess I'm very protective of her, and this honestly broke my heart that he said this to me. I just turned white and said, ""Oh my god Sam, that's so mean! Don't say that."" He just laughs it off, and the send off was just weird. I felt so uncomfortable, and I ended up lying in bed after eating some food, overthinking how the next couple days are about to go.

Saturday, I get up for work, I am a complete zombie. Sam asked me to bring his backpack to work, because he forgot some stuff from it and needed it when he got back. I grabbed it in my slump/grumpy mood, and headed to the kitchen. My mom, bless her, asks me how my night was, and I'm honest with her, saying it was nice but I'm starting to feel uncomfortable/irritated about him not planning anything during this trip and keeping me up so late. She offered to have him stay here in the spare room Saturday night, but I just had this feeling in my gut that I did not want him staying with us. I told her I didn't want to, I was not going to offer it to him either, and I think that's when my mom was starting to pick up on my feelings. She drops it, I make myself a coffee, and head off to work.

Sam gets to his event and has a good time, and I am getting really anxious about the original plan; booking an air bnb and staying the night with Sam. As soon as Sam is done at the event and back on the road to my city, I let him know how much anxiety I'm getting about staying the night at an air bnb, because I've NEVER stayed at an air bnb before. He begs me to stay with him, so I just told him I'd think about it. This is around 3 pm, I won't be done with work until about 8. I had already decided in my head I was not going through with the air bnb.

A few hours go by, and I decide to text this to Sam: ""I don't think I can. I really liked the idea of it, but the more I think about it, I'm just too scared. I never used air bnb, I haven't slept in a bed that isn't mine in like 4 years. I can ask my mom again and see if you can stay the night here, but she said we woke her up a couple times last night. Maybe in the future, but I'm just not there yet."" I know, I lied. Honestly, I just really didn’t want to spend the night with Sam.

His response: ""We gotta work on your anxiety bro cause that's no way to live. Only you can do the work for yourself. It's a matter of if you want it, then you gotta do it. Tough love my guy. I just want to smoke and sleep."" This is where I pretty much just left it until finishing work. He met me there and waited until I was off, gave him his backpack, cleaned up and we headed over to my house again. By the time we had gotten up to my room and started talking about what to do for the night, it was 9:30. He was really pressuring me to still get an air bnb, showing me different listings nearby, but I kept saying no.

At 10:30 we had been going back and forth, and he said he is in a different country, doesn't know anything that's around, and would rather sleep in his car before staying at an air bnb himself, I just kept saying no. We both went quiet for a bit when he was getting really upset and said, ""why can't you just put your anxiety aside for one night?""
I knew for a fact that if we got the air bnb, I was not going to sleep and I would be extremely anxious. I knew we had to find something pet safe because my dog comes everywhere with me, and I wouldn't be able to go the night without her. I felt like I'd still need my space, and this listing had 3 beds. Well... I caved.

The people pleaser in me was overriding, and I picked an air bnb 30 minutes away and we booked it. I saw in the listing that it had the code for the front door  before booking, and was a little weirded out by it, but didn't mention it right away. It's a 3 bedroom, pet safe place with parking and wifi. We got the info and confirmation for the air bnb, packed up some stuff and headed to the car. I texted my mom the address (she knew I didn't want to go), and she texted me back that at any point I want to come home, just sent a message.

At 11, the car was ready, and he handed me the keys to his car, telling me to drive, since he was driving all day and was tired. I didn't want to start anything before spending the night somewhere new, so we got in the car. On the drive, I mentioned the front door access code was in the listing to Sam, and he got really sketched out, messaging the host about it. We ended up calling them to sort out the parking, got that situated, and took our stuff to the house.

We unlock the front door, and see a door in front of us with a key, and a staircase around the right corner. It's a split air bnb; 3 bedroom on the upper level, 3 bedrooms on the lower. We had booked the upper level, not realizing it was a split house, put our stuff down inside, and saw the bulletin for air bnb guests.. No. Pets. Allowed. Sam used the bathroom and came out seeing my worry, but reassured me the posting allows up to 6 people and 1 pet. That helped a bit, but I still had a bad feeling in my gut.

We went outside to smoke, and chatted for a few minutes before heading back in. I walked into the biggest bedroom with some of our stuff, and a spider is hanging from the ceiling right above the bed. I hate spiders, so Sam said he'd open the window and let it outside. It was at this moment we realized the window screen is broken, and the bedroom window doesn't lock. The spider fell, Sam said he ""dealt with it,"" and ""we are sleeping in the same bed now, you don't have a choice anymore.""

I sat on the bed, starting to panic. I listen to these types of stories on scary story podcasts; an air bnb with a stranger, someone breaks in, you get robbed, murdered, or both (Yes I know that's my anxiety talking, but I was starting to spiral at this point). Sam sat on the bed with me, and I started shaking, knots in my stomach. I did not feel safe, I was not staying here. I felt bad for making Sam spend money, and told him I can't stay. He said that if I'm leaving, that he is not comfortable staying here either.

As much as I felt I didn't want him staying at my parents, it is scarier for me to stay at this place than in my own house. I confessed to him that I lied about my mom offering the spare room for him to spend the night. I texted my mom that we weren't sober, and we were too scared to stay the night in the air bnb. I explained about the no pets allowed on the bulletin, the front door, the broken window, and I was having a horrible panic attack about staying the night. Sam was offered the spare bedroom, and my mom said she's on the way.

When I say this was the worst panic attack of my life, believe me. Sam and I sat on the bed talking for 15 minutes, then packed our things up and got tf OUT. We were just going to keep his car there and pick it up in the morning when we were sober again. My mom pulled into the driveway at nearly 1 am, and it wasn't until I opened the door that we saw my dad was also in the car. It was an awkward as hell 30 minute car ride, but we were both so thankful and made sure my parents knew that.

I told my parents I was sorry for keeping them up and telling them I wasn't comfortable with Sam in the house but I was more comfortable knowing he was staying at our house than the air bnb. I told Sam I was sorry I didn't just offer the spare room when it was first offered, and for keeping him up even longer. Sam told my mom that he was sorry for waking her up last night, and I realized I never told either of them I lied about that part (in my mind it was the reason my mom ""said he couldn't use the spare room"" the second night, but I hadn't clarified it to either of them).

My mom responded, ""You didn't wake me up last night?"" And Sam looked at me. I guess my mom saw me freeze and said, ""Oh. Wait. I.. thought it was you guys that woke me up, but I was just really hot last night. I don't think it was you guys."" That's pretty much where conversation dropped between Sam and I, and my parents for the last few minutes of the drive.

My parents were very easygoing with everything and tried to just make light talk with each other to ease the tension in the car. We got back to my parents house, made the bed for Sam and all headed to bed for the night. Sam was dealing with the host complaining about the car staying in the driveway, but when we brought up all our concerns about the air bnb, he shut up pretty quick. I messaged him saying that I was so sorry for lying to him, but he never acknowledged it so I wasn't sure where we were standing.

This morning I woke up with a pounding headache, messaged Sam to make sure he was up, and we took off for his car. He had all his things with him, and said he was just going to head home when he got to his car. Honestly, that was probably for the better since things had been so mucked up the night before, and there was still a lot of tension between us. He got his car, we made sure he was all sorted at a nearby gas station, and I bought him a couple drinks. We hugged and agreed next time we hang out, things definitely have to be planned out better. He started his drive home, and I headed home myself as well, ready for a nap already.

NOW.. I bet the past few paragraphs of this story, you have been confused about my feelings towards Sam. Honestly, so am I. Sam and I have been friends for so long, but I do recognize that some of the things he did this weekend are red flags and really controlling behaviours. I don't know if I want to continue this friendship with Sam, but I am so f-ing lost right now guys. I think I just want to know how other people see this post without being directly involved. My work friend and my sister both think I should ghost him, and my mom thinks I should cut him off.

I WAS still uncomfortable with Sam being in the house and riding in the car with my parents, but I didn't want to tip him off on how I was feeling towards him; the constant pressuring me to get an air bnb knowing how anxious I was, not taking no as an answer after saying it multiple times, not having anything planned and keeping me up until past 2 am on a work night for me, calling my sister ugly? It's been really hard trying to understand my feelings and emotions. Please. Help. Give me your input.",0,1749473484.0,relationship_advice,2,0.4,False

1. Location/living/HHI : I live with my husband and 1 child in a MCOL area. For income I make about $100k. Husband makes about the same. We don't combine incomes and I shop for groceries and we even it out at the end of the month. By most people's standards this is weird but we're both two fiercely independent nerds and it works for both of us. Maybe it's because we got together later in life.

2. How much do you cook?: I enjoy cooking and cook most meals. My husband prefers speed and no dishes so he does microwave meals if what I cooked isn't up his alley or it's faster for lunch/dinner. We eat out maybe 1-2 times a week and have been successfully working on dialing it back this year, especially delivery apps.

3. Dietary requirements: all 3 of us have very different dietary preferences. I try to err on a very loose paleo/lower carbs and lots of vegetables and protein. If I buy meat I try to find a local farm, rbst-free dairy, stuff like that, but also keeping a balance with convenience foods because working mom needs fast easy meals. My quick meals are pasta; quesadillas; noodle soups and stir fries; or the ever popular dumplings + egg/tofu + rice. Every meal has a veggie. Every now and then we have ""Racoon Dinner"" (or what is now more popularly known as Girl Dinner) which is where we make sure to get fruit and veggies in but otherwise just about anything that's not dessert goes.

4. Fave kitchen appliance: does deep freezer count? It's made it easier to buy farm shares of meat or giant bags of nuggets and fish sticks.

5. Top places I shop: regional supermarket chain, membership club (mostly for paper goods, protein shakes/bars, and coupon sales), Asian markets, farm stores for meat

I had surgery which has a long recovery period (months) and going in to stores and shopping is hard for me for big trips. But I love grocery shopping, cooking at home, and keeping my pantry stocked, so I may not use everything I buy and I'll pull stuff out of my cabinet/deep freezer rotation. I'm also trying to find a balance with being in ""body needs to recover"" mode to conserve energy and still eat fairly healthy.

Day 1 regional supermarket: $165
Local bread ($5 a loaf but it's so good and keeps well throughout the week), big tub of plain greek yogurt, 2 bags shredded cheese, 1 bag sliced cheese, butter, 1 frozen microwave meal & individual frozen pizzas, diet mtn dew, bagels, peanut butter, instant regular and decaf coffee, potato chips, whole wheat sandwich bread, refried beans, salad dressing, applesauce, Pringles Mingles, bacon, pepperoni, deli turkey, cantaloupe, strawberries, romaine lettuce, shrimp, snow crab.

Day 6 Date night : burger & fries + cocktail for the Mr, sandwich and fries for me. $75 with tip. 

The ROI on dining out lately has been really meh for me lately but we tried a new place and it was great. Will happily go back here again. Sandwich was so big I brought home half for another meal later.

Day 9 Weee! Grocery delivery: $62
Gai lan, bok choy, Japanese eggplant, tofu, frozen har cheong fan, har gow, fresh noodles, air dried noodles, 5 lbs jasmine rice, 15 lb medium grain rice, gochujang, Korean chili flakes.

I used the eggplant to make myself some ground pork and eggplant with spicy peppers from my garden from last year. Super thankful for the delivery because my Asian markets are a bit of a drive and I just don't think I could have lifted the big bag of rice in a store. Also veggies. Yay! Used the tofu to make salt & pepper tofu in the air fryer.
Made scallion oil noodles a few times with the noodles adding on dumplings I'd either already made or bought from the freezer occasionally.
The frozen dim sum are a nice midnight snack or Racoon Dinner component.

Pie from local store: $19 idk what they do to the crust but it stays crispy for an entire week.

Day 13 medium pizza with two toppings from local pizzeria with loyalty discount: $23-10 =$13

Day 14 regional Supermarket: $201 (wow they actually had everything in stock!)
Egg noodles, $5 bread, whole wheat sandwich bread, hamburger buns, skim milk, almond milk, eggs, whole bunch of frozen microwave meals and individual pizzas, frozen corn, Italian ice, caramel sauce, diet mtn dew, diet Dr pepper, diet root beer, jarred jalapeños, can beef broth, can cream of chicken soup, cheese crackers, grocery brand thin mints, grocery brand oreos, Graham crackers, potato chips, mustard, dried cranberries, snack cakes, tortillas, salsa, burger patties, blueberries, strawberries, watermelon, cucumbers, broccoli, broccoli slaw, corn on the cob.
This is a little on the high side but we're bringing burgers and some other things to a friend's house for a party.

5 Below: $3.25. 
Found those viral Peelers candies and got 2 bags for $1.50 each. Honestly not bad, but gave most of them to the kid to take to school and share with friends.

Day 15 Deli for bagels - $14 cash for a baker's dozen. Froze some to eat later on.

Day 20 ice cream store - $15 2 kiddie cones (which are massive) and a regular shake. It is time for seasonal ice cream shops to be open and I will stuff as much soft serve down my gullet in the summer as I can at any opportunity.

Day 21 regional Supermarket: $56 - had to pick up some stuff from the pharmacy and picked up some little bits and bobs for the week. Canned fruit, bananas, watermelon, strawberries, raspberries, 2 loaves of the good $5 a loaf bread, soup, tomatoes to make tomato soup, pistachios, butter, shredded cheese.

Mexican restaurant: $23 with tax and tip. 3 Birria tacos, rice and beans water to drink for a rare solo dinner out with friends. Good tacos and we lost track of time and were there for hours! It wasn't busy, so no table hogging here.

Day 22 $11 ice cream stand 2 kiddie sundaes.

$25 large pizza with a bunch of toppings 

Day 26 $140 Membership Club - $53 in home office supplies = $87 actual food
Bulk restock - cereal bars, animal crackers, chips, protein bars, deli meat, melon.
$83 Weee! Delivery - having friends over for hot pot in a few days so getting some essentials and a bunch of hot pot sliced meat goodies. Sliced beef, pork, lamb, Shanghai bok choy, beef tendon meatballs, cilantro, oodles of noodles, ginger, seasoned seaweed packs, dried jujube, ginger, gel sunscreen. It's cheaper for me to host 6 people at my house than it is to go out for dinner for two at a restaurant for hot pot in my area (avg $50+ pp). 

Day 27 $92 (husband paid) same restaurant as date night with  for family dinner, 3 entrees, 1 drink, 1 shared dessert. 

Day 28 Local Farm $325/2 = $162.50 for a meat share with chicken, beef, and pork I split with another family. This will last us several months.

Gas Station - $7 3 drinks on way to farm

BBQ - $77 (pick up - I called and ordered, husband paid) nice sampling of a little bit of everything.

Day 29 - $40 diner for entirely too much delicious food and unlimited coffee. I'll never tire of eggs someone else has made and toast.

$15 (husband paid) ice cream stand for 2 kiddie sundaes and a milkshake. 

*Total monthly spend* :

$1,245.75 total

$859.75 groceries 

$386 dining out 

With regional Supermarket any time I put in an order it's a bit of a game of chance of what they'll have in stock and if they actually replace it. Usually 30% of my order will be out of stock and no substitutes availabile, so I've learned to order a bit more. Some weeks we actually get everything and that drives the bill up.

Soda is one of our biggest household vices, and honestly we're boring responsible people so if this as as wild as we get, I'm fine with it but believe it or not we've dialed back how much we consume with how fast prices have risen in the last few years.

My kid has a never ending appetite and we are the hang out house in our neighborhood full of similar kids who know they can have as much as they want whenever they want - it's healing my inner child to see so many happy kids feeling comfortable in my house.

It was so convenient when she was a baby! The sheets were right there next to the crib, and we also used them for towels, washcloths, and extra receiving blankets. 

Now she is two, we've converted the crib to a toddler bed, but the drawers remain. And she likes to begin every morning and every post-nap wake up by opening her drawers, pulling out every sheet, blanket, towel, and washcloth, bringing them into her bed, and playing with them. This was not something I planned for or foresaw when I was pregnant and shopping. 

I still do not regret my purchase. In fact, I appreciate that she is able to entertain herself this way so I can get a few extra minutes to start the coffee or wrap up a chore. But I thought other parents to be should be warned. 

That is all. Happy nesting. ",122,1749473230.0,BabyBumps,12,0.98,False
1l73tmn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l73tmn,Artist Spotlight: Dave,"
Dave. Oh where do we start with Dave? From the first performance with Sleep Token as iii opening for *Motorpsycho* to present day, Dave has always brought his “A” game. Unlike the rest of the band, you can't seem to keep him silent as he shouts at the crowd. He acts as a hype-man, encouraging the masses to gather in the pit, or snapping back at hecklers. As another fan once told me, “you gotta admire the guy for trying to get a crowd of white people to clap on beat.” When his mouth isn't going the rest of him is. Head banging, spin kicks, flying bass guitars or antics with the other members of Sleep Token, it's no wonder most pictures taken of iii end up half-blurry.

Yet there is so much more to this guitar and bass-playing demonic whirlwind. Despite his chaotic stage presence, Dave is a man about his business, with a love for the art of music.

Early years

Born in April 1991, Dave first started playing guitar around age 13. He looked up to greats such as Justin Hawkins from *The Darkness* and Marc Bolan of *T-Rex* whose later album *Electric Warrior* essentially kick-started the glam rock craze in the UK. 

Self taught, Dave often learns or writes his parts by ear. In his first band, *Silhouette of a Ghost (2010-2015)*, he played guitar and was well on his way to establishing his charismatic stage presence. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RwTb_7OCvU

*(this man has not changed)*

Career

Dave is all about the music. Often in multiple bands at the same time either as a guitarist or bass player. During his time with *Silhouette of a Ghost*, he also played bass for *Comeoutfiring (2011)*, and *Black Shapes (2014-2015)* before joining *Sleep Token (2016-present)* as a touring bassist. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj7Kxpleldw
*(really, this man has not changed)*

Dave joined up with *Pint Glass (2019-2023)* as a guitarist then branched out his skill set with *Your Misery (2022)* and *Plini (2023)* as a member of the touring crew. This year Dave announced a new project via Instagram called *Spitting Glass,* as of writing, no full songs have been posted, but his fanbase patiently awaits the first release.

Other creative outlets

I really have to respect this man and his efforts to maintain his lifestyle and online presence even though one of the bands he plays for is blowing up in the most intense way. Most information here is gleaned from his personal Instagram, where he seems to have an appreciation for good food, good coffee, and good music. He also joins a friend for streaming COD on Twitch now and then. If we are lucky, he will post a story, host a Q&A (where a good amount of information in the post came from) or upload videos of past projects or current ditties. He supports other bands and will share pictures of shows or recommendations.

All this being said, there are still rules of engagement when it comes to Dave. Don't message him, at best he will ignore you, at worst, you will be blocked. Same with the comments section on his posts. If he wants feedback he will ask for it. If you are fortunate enough to catch him in a stream, do not ask about *Sleep Token.* He is either contractually bound to silence, or finds it rude that with all the other work he's done, people only want to know about Edgy McEdgelord over there. If the chat gets too rowdy, he will log off and fuck off. If you ever are fortunate enough to see him at a show in the wild, show respect and *leave him alone.*

Dave interacts with the world on Dave's terms. You don't know him, he doesn't know you. 

Tools

While I would love to give a breakdown of his many guitars and bass guitars in his personal collection, as of writing I have not been able to find documentation on them outside of the mention of a collection and various instruments showing up in his videos. There are videos that showcase the guitars that he uses in Sleep Token, but those belong to the entity of Sleep Token, not Dave's personal collection. (As far as I know) 

Closing remarks

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ZGmEXm06M 
*(Pint Glass because this performance is fun)*

Dave is a treasure with a biting sense of humor. From his enthusiastic stage presence to telling off other players in COD, his determination to live his best life is unparalleled. I wonder if he knows how many young fans he inspired to pick up a guitar or bass? Be it playing to a packed arena of thousands, or smaller venue, Dave can't help but be Dave.

I am a student and also an apprentice and I have been experiencing weird things with a co worker 

It’s been more than 6 months since I have started to work there and there is that woman who was supposed to teach me how to do my job who’s been making it hard for me. 

At first I guess she wanted to become my friend  she was over sharing a lot being nice buying me coffee and stuff but quickly I have started to notice that sometimes she could switch and then act really mean towards me, and say mean things, things that are obviously against my convictions and I felt like she was saying these stuff on purpose to trigger me. 

I also notice that at the same time she was always trying to get close to me to know things about me my family and stuff, she kind of stalked me on the internet and sometimes appeared telling me things I never told her and then proceeded to gaslight me into thinking I gave her these information 

Another thing I have noticed is how she always knows about everything without me saying anything. She was always trying to offer me food, telling me to sleep at her place if I missed my train because I live far from work (I only knew her for a week) and at the same time like I said she was sometimes making me panick about my skills my ability to find a job after this and how she could clearly see how insecure and anxious and naive I was.

Also she is someone who’s always talking she never stop talking in a way that during the 3 first months at work when I was forced to stay with her I came back home feeling empty and that is something that triggered me 

It felt as if my soul had left my body I couldn’t focus on anything, nor my homework or talking to my friends I just felt brainless and soulless and kind of hyper focused on her or the conversation I had with her 


I started to take some distance with her 3 months ago when I finally got autonomous enough to work on my own and I feel like she hated me for being distance because she wanted to control me ? Starting from there I started getting sick (physically) from nowhere, she was playing nice with me and then suddenly she switched and became somehow “ oppressive “ towards me so I ended up being obsessed with my work because I was scared to mess up and she would try to provoke my mistakes by exploiting my weakness 

Ever since I tried my best to avoid her but she always find a way to talk about me to other coworkers in a way so that I can come back to her 

I have been feeling completely crazy these past days because I realised I am obsessed with what she could do against me, it is absolutely irrational but I am becoming paralysed by her, and I feel like there is something evil in her, deeply dark she’s not just someone who’s harassing me at work 

Can somebody tell me if what I feel spiritually is legit or am I completely losing my mind ? 

Thanks in advance  ",2,1749472881.0,Christianity,1,0.75,False
1l73qyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/flairairlines/comments/1l73qyr/first_and_last_time_with_flair/,First and last time with Flair,"Booked a trip from Kitchener to Vancouver back in February for a wedding in May, through Expedia, for my wife and I. Flight on Friday morning and we would have been there around noon. Expedia offered a nice package with flight, hotel and car rental. A few weeks later Flair sends me a message informing the flight has changed and is now in the evening at 8:30pm landing at 10:30pm (F8841). I can cancel for free or change for fee. First strike. Not my fault the flight changed but if I’m not happy, still around 3 months before, I can always pay more and change…

Hotel would still be nice but car rental is no more correct so I have to cancel the hotel+car part of the package and redo with a different car rental…

Far forward to departure day. We only needed one carry on for the two of us so we paid the additional fee (65 bucks, funny when Air Canada charges for a checked in baggage for 35 bucks…). My wife had the carry on on her ticket, so she assumedly could go directly to the door. I don’t have any carry on, so I’m informed I have to go to check in anyway. Fun fact: checking in in advance is free, but you don’t save time and still have to check in again apparently… so at the airport my wife and I go to check together. There they make you put your personal item in the tiny compartment, even though your item looks like it fits… everyone trying to squeeze their stuff in there to avoid the carry on fee. Lol. Ok I think that’s strike two. Let’s treat customers like crap.

Comes the time of boarding. Announcement: flight is delayed, boarding is now at 6:40am. What?!… some story about some plane maintenance or something. Great. Strike three.

On the way back home, we get another message (text): actually flight will be at 8:30am landing at 10:30am. Amazing! Just a few hours before the wedding, we’ll be in great shape no doubt! Message also says we’re entitled to some compensation with a link to a page where we can provide details and receipts…

Next day, 3 hours early at the airport (yeah why do 2 hours for domestic flights like other airlines, right? Oh yeah, probably because you need to line up for the checking…) we have to check in again!? Great! Strike four. Baggage sizing contest again, obviously.

Eventually flight takes off as expected and we arrive safely, at least. Oh I didn’t mention that I’d thought I’d get a coffee or a water on board but… you have to pay even for that!? OK strike five.

Return flight after the weekend. Oh I forgot: that one too had been changed too 3 months before and instead of traveling during the day we were traveling overnight… good we had decided to take the next day off…

Anyway back home I fill the claim for asking for them to reimburse me my first hotel night and first car rental day since i had 3 nights and 3 days in my package I calculate 1/3 of it and claim 400 bucks with the expedia receipt.

First answer comes in 2 weeks later: since we knew 3 months in advance flight was changed they don’t reimburse… uh, what?!

I reply back saying I’m not claiming for that but for the 12 hours delay the day of.

Reply next day: since hotel is at destination and not at departure point, they don’t reimburse…

OK got the point: whatever you ask for, they don’t reimburse. Strike six.

Next step: Air passenger protection complaint. Have to wait for 30 days but yeah I’ll do it. I’m even considering adding a lawyer to the mix and claiming for the moral distress this caused my wife and I, going to a wedding with almost no sleep, and the risk of making us drive the next day with almost no rest.

In any case we just booked our next trip to the east coast with Air Canada. We’re done with cheap airlines. The only benefit we were looking for, this said, was not having to drive to Toronto Pearson. I guess eventually it’s worth it to get a decent and respectful airline. Oh and both personal item AND carry on are free.

Flair is done. Enjoy your bankruptcy.

There’s no guardrail, only the occasional goat. Every switchback climbs deeper into the ribs of the Blue Mountains, where the air thins and the coffee thickens into legend. The car rattles from potholes the size of bathtubs and the driver is half-monk, half-daredevil. Humming ska as though cliffside death was just another verse in a summer tune.

This is where the beans grow slow. The altitude lulls them into patience. Rain drips from banana leaves and sunlight filters through mist like a broken promise. The soil is rich volcanic grit and ancient rot. It births a flavor profile that makes espresso snobs weep into their demitasses. Blue Mountain coffee isn’t hype. It’s ceremony. It’s heresy to gulp it. It costs more than a steak in Manhattan and it’s worth it.

You land at one of the boutique estates, tucked into the folds of a landscape that doesn’t care if you exist. These aren’t mega-farms churning out industrial roast for supermarkets. These are small plots run by hands that know every plant like an old song. People who roast by feel. Farmers who wake before the mist and pick cherries one by one, only when the fruit begs to be taken. It’s all so absurdly romantic it should be on a postcard, but the sweat is real and the beans don’t grow themselves.

Inside the processing huts, machines hum soft like bees on sedatives. The pulpers churn out slippery cherry skins, leaving beans to ferment in open-air tanks that reek in the best way possible. This is where the magic brews. Bacterial funk, time, and humidity twisting those seeds into gold. Then they’re dried, sorted, graded, massaged, and whispered to. No detail is ignored. You’re not drinking coffee. You’re sipping obsession.

Then comes the tasting. Not your average cup slopped into a Styrofoam mug at a truck stop. This is ritual. The grounds bloom in water just off the boil. No sugar. No cream. No nonsense. The aroma hits first. Mild, floral, and smooth with a whisper of citrus. Then the sip. Sweet without trying. Balanced in a way that makes other coffees seem aggressive, like a polite conversation at a jazz club while everyone else is screaming into microphones. There’s no bitterness. Just clarity. It doesn’t punch you. It unfolds. You don’t drink this stuff on the way to work. You sit, you breathe, and you let the cup take its time.

You meet the roasters. Stoic, sunburned, and stained with years of caffeine and toil. They speak in flavors, not data. They know when a batch is done by the crackle, not the clock. The smoke curling out of the roastery smells like breakfast on a mountaintop built by angels with nicotine habits. This is the world behind the luxury. No baristas in suspenders, no latte art competitions. Just dirt, fire, water, and the bean.

By the end of the tour, your bloodstream is laced with caffeine, altitude, and clarity. You’ve paid too much for a small bag of beans, and you’ll pay again without blinking. Because once you’ve tasted this, everything else tastes like compromise.

The drive back down feels different. Quieter. Like the mountain let you in and now it’s watching you leave with one eyebrow raised. You’re not sure if the coffee was that good or if the mountain slipped something extra into the cup. Doesn’t matter. You’ll chase that taste through every overpriced café from Tokyo to Toronto, knowing full well the only place to find it again is on that ragged road slicing through fog and banana trees.

1l73pdo,https://i.redd.it/3jk98j8lcw5f1.jpeg,$ATYR – Phase 3 Catalyst Behaviour: Deep Dive Into What Actually Drives Biotech Stocks,"Hi folks, 

I hope you had a restful weekend.

If you’ve been following $ATYR, you’ll know that last week was a genuine turning point—not just for the company, but for everyone watching the setup unfold. In just a few days, we saw the long-awaited SSC-ILD readout arrive, a pivotal fireside appearance by Sanjay Shukla at the Jefferies Healthcare Conference, and a notable shift in the share price as the market began to reprice what comes next. The volume, liquidity, and tone all changed. It’s been one of the most eventful periods I can remember, and I think it’s left a lot of us asking: what actually happens in a market like this, as a true Phase 3 catalyst approaches?

That’s the context for this post. With the Phase 3 sarcoidosis readout now firmly on the horizon—timing somewhere between late August and the end of September—I thought it was the right moment to step above the noise, look at what the research and real data actually say about biotech stock behaviour around pivotal catalysts, and try to draw out some deeper insight. This isn’t about making a specific prediction or calling the next move. It’s about building a more robust mental model—one that’s grounded in research, event studies, real-world case data, and a fair bit of theory and synthesis I’ve poured through. It’s not a crystal ball; there are always dozens of market factors at play. Instead, think of this as an attempt to provide a framework—something to provoke strategic and creative thinking, not a how-to manual or a call to action.

As always, this is a deep-dive, long read—the kind of post you’ve come to expect from me. It’s comprehensive, it’s layered, and it’s designed to be both readable and genuinely useful to anyone trying to navigate the coming weeks.

## 1. Phase 3 Trial Catalysts in US Biotech: Structural Realities, Market Psychology, and the Anatomy of the Run-Up

When investors talk about binary catalysts in biotech, they’re describing the convergence of science, capital structure, and market psychology around a single, high-stakes event. For a company like $ATYR—an archetypal US small-cap biotech with one pivotal late-stage asset—everything hinges on the Phase 3 readout. While empirical literature provides a framework, real market behaviour is shaped as much by microstructure and sentiment as by statistical averages.

---

### A. Why Phase 3 Readouts Command the Entire Valuation

For most small biotechs, a pivotal Phase 3 result isn’t just a value inflection point—it *is* the value. When nearly all future cash flows depend on a single program (as with $ATYR), probability-weighted valuation collapses to a binary: pass or fail.

Several factors amplify the stakes:

- **Regulatory gauntlet:** Only 50–60% of Phase 3 trials succeed; failure rates are even higher in first-in-class, rare, or complex diseases. The market knows a promising Phase 2 can flatline at Phase 3, loading the event with existential risk.
- **Funding risk:** Many small-caps are financially stretched. A positive readout opens doors to capital, partnerships, or M&A; a negative one often triggers punitive fundraising or restructuring.
- **No plan B:** With almost all value riding on a lead asset, failure typically leads to losses 2–4x greater than the gains from success.

**In my view:**  
For $ATYR, this Phase 3 is existential. Success unlocks the only approved therapy in a global orphan disease and drives regulatory, commercial, and M&A optionality. Failure would erase most of the company’s value in the near term—every price movement is ultimately filtered through this lens.

---

### B. The Anatomy of the Pre-Catalyst Run-Up: Drift, Positioning, and Expectation Premium

One of biotech’s most persistent—and misunderstood—phenomena is the pre-catalyst run-up. In theory, markets should price in all information well ahead of the event. In practice, the run-up is shaped by rational repricing, herd behaviour, information leakage, and reflexivity.

#### 1. Empirical Patterns

- **Average run-up:** Median small-cap biotechs see 10–20% price gains in the 1–3 months ahead of a Phase 3 event. “Winners” actually run more than “losers,” even when controlling for outcomes.
- **Volume and volatility:** Trading volume and options activity spike. Implied volatility (IV) climbs sharply, especially in the final days.
- **Short interest:** Short sellers often crowd in, betting on a “sell the news” outcome or a miss.

#### 2. Drivers of the Run-Up

In my opinion, the run-up reflects overlapping forces:

- **Expectation premium:** Buyers pay for “lottery ticket” optionality, especially when success rates are misunderstood or when sentiment shifts. Incremental signals—conference appearances, KOL commentary, competitor missteps—can accelerate optimism.
- **Information leakage and insider behaviour:** Markets pick up on body language, quiet periods, or subtle signals. Negative news sometimes leaks, causing a small pre-event drift lower, but the run-up is stronger and more sustained for positive events.
- **Retail and social media:** Forums like Reddit, Twitter, and Discord have amplified retail and institutional crowding, driving volatility beyond fundamentals.
- **Options and derivatives:** Event IV spikes as traders use options for leveraged exposure, forcing dealers to hedge and sometimes amplifying spot price moves.

#### 3. What This Means for $ATYR

$ATYR’s recent price action has followed this playbook: running up before milestones (SSC-ILD, Jefferies), powered by growing institutional and retail ownership and a tight float. But the run-up isn’t a guarantee—history is full of stocks that rallied into an event only to collapse on disappointment or “not quite good enough” results. The expectation premium is fleeting; price typically resets post-catalyst.

---

### C. Not All Phase 3s Are Created Equal: Differentiating the Setup

A common mistake among investors is treating all Phase 3s as equal. In reality, the scale and persistence of post-catalyst moves depend on the asset, competitive context, and structure of both the trial and company.

#### 1. Asset Quality & Unmet Need

- **First-in-class/orphan:** Being first with an approved therapy for a neglected disease (as with $ATYR) creates a “scarcity premium.” If data is clean, upside can be parabolic—crowded fields never see this.
- **Regulatory designations:** Orphan, fast track, and breakthrough badges reduce risk and increase value—these matter, both for FDA support and for institutional interest.
- **Trial design:** Robust, well-powered, and pragmatic trials (like EFZO-FIT) are more likely to produce clear, actionable market reactions.

#### 2. Competitive and Platform Context

- **Single-asset vs. platform:** Companies with one asset live and die by the readout. Diversified platforms have softer moves; $ATYR is all-in.
- **Competitor dynamics:** If rivals fail pre-readout, price can run further. If competitors succeed, hype may deflate.

#### 3. Market Structure & Shareholder Base

- **Float composition:** A tightly held float, especially with high institutional and motivated retail ownership (as in $ATYR), exaggerates supply/demand imbalances—air pockets and vertical spikes become likely.
- **Technical factors:** Heavy call OI, high short interest, and volume surges raise the odds of reflexive moves or squeezes.

#### 4. Expectations and Market Memory

- **Expectations game:** Universal bullishness can mean flat or negative moves even on “good” results. Low or mixed expectations make positive surprises more powerful.
- **Persistence:** Most price discovery occurs in the first 1–2 days; mean reversion is common unless the catalyst truly resets the thesis.

---

### D. What the Data Actually Shows—and Why It Matters for $ATYR

To summarise the evidence:

- **Positive Phase 3s (small-caps):** Day one abnormal returns of +5–15%; rare, “breakout” wins can see +50–100%.
- **Negative Phase 3s:** –20% to –50% on average; losses are more severe and longer-lasting than gains.
- **Run-up:** Real but noisy; +10–20% pre-catalyst drift is common, but can be erased if news underwhelms.
- **Size/float as multipliers:** Smaller, tightly held names like $ATYR experience larger, faster swings.
- **Regulatory/commercial context:** Orphan/fast track and unmet need intensify both run-up and post-event reactions.

**In my view:**  
Every layer of the classic small-cap biotech setup is present—and possibly exaggerated—in $ATYR. Tight float, high engagement, elevated IV, and a true orphan program create explosive upside potential, but also magnify reversion risk.

---

**To sum up:**  
Phase 3 catalysts in US small-cap biotech compress years of risk into a single event. Price is shaped as much by expectation, positioning, and psychology as by the underlying data. For $ATYR, this trial is the crucible—run-up, structure, and trial uniqueness mean a non-linear outcome is almost inevitable.

---

## 2. What Makes $ATYR’s Setup Distinct? Structure, Scarcity, and Market Dynamics

Generalities like “high risk, high reward” or “binary event” miss what really makes a setup like $ATYR unique. The intersection of pipeline concentration, float dynamics, institutional ownership, designations, and market structure is what creates true asymmetric opportunity—or risk.

---

### A. Pipeline Concentration: The Pure-Play Catalyst

Nearly all of $ATYR’s enterprise value is levered to efzofitimod’s Phase 3 in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Other programs matter long-term, but heading into this readout, the narrative is binary.

- **Volatility is a function of information density:** Even minor data points or management cues can drive price, as each update is a proxy for the binary outcome.
- **Winner-takes-all:** Success leads to re-rating across every metric; failure triggers collapse.

**In my view:**  
This all-or-nothing profile doesn’t just increase volatility—it channels it, making price action more about flows, hedging, and accumulation than fundamentals in the short run.

---

### B. Float, Institutional Ownership, and the “True” Supply/Demand Picture

#### 1. Reported vs. Real Institutional Ownership

As of mid-May 2025, 13F/NPORT data showed institutional ownership at ~70% of float—exceptionally high for a sub-$500M biotech. But the real number is likely higher due to:

- **Reporting lag:** Filings are 6–10 weeks old when published.
- **Recent trends:** Institutional ownership grew 11% QoQ; post-SSC-ILD, Jefferies, and recent volume spikes likely pushed real ownership higher.
- **Supporting signals:** Multi-million share days, float-tightening price action, and absence of distribution suggest >70% of the effective float is now in “sticky hands”—possibly 75–80%+.

#### 2. Float Mechanics and the Illiquidity Trap

With 70–80% of 86M shares locked, the effective tradable float could be as low as 15–25M. Post-catalyst demand magnifies supply/demand imbalance; shares can “disappear,” causing price to gap up in dollars, not cents.

#### 3. Ownership Quality

- **Holder mix:** Specialist funds, crossovers, generalists, and high-conviction retail. “Real money” funds ride volatility and accumulate, not capitulate, on noise.
- **Sticky hands:** Insider buying and slow-moving funds reinforce this dynamic.
- **Behavioural feedback:** These holders amplify moves in both directions; add on wins, exit methodically on losses.

**The way I see it:**  
$ATYR’s ownership and float sit at the heart of a live supply/demand experiment—minimal “real” float, patient buyers, and a setup primed for dramatic moves.

---

### C. Regulatory and Competitive Positioning: The Scarcity Premium

- **Orphan drug/fast track:** $ATYR has 7 years of US exclusivity, priority for guidelines, and expedited review—hugely valuable for both commercial and M&A positioning.
- **First-in-class:** No approved therapies for pulmonary sarcoidosis; if $ATYR wins, it dominates an uncontested market.
- **Failed competitors:** Recent failures (e.g., Novartis’s IL-17) sharpen the scarcity premium—if $ATYR delivers, the next best program is years behind.
- **M&A leverage:** Big pharma, facing IP cliffs and depleted pipelines, will pay up for rare, de-risked assets. The scarcity premium here is not theoretical—it’s real and has driven multiple-bidder situations in analogous cases.

---

### D. Options, Short Interest, and Reflexive Dynamics

- **Options chain:** Structurally high IV, significant OI at key calls ($6, $7.50, $10), and loaded vega at long-dated strikes—a sign of institutional positioning for large moves, not just direction.
- **Short interest:** Elevated, not just as a “bet against,” but as a play on post-catalyst volatility. Positive news could force shorts to cover into a vanishing float.
- **Technical patterns:** Compression, base-building, and options/hedging data all point to a coiled, high-breakout-risk setup.

---

### E. Management Signal and Market Sentiment

- **Operational discipline:** Sanjay Shukla and team remain measured, facts-focused, and institutionally oriented—reducing hype and classic “biotech drama.”
- **Investor perception:** Transparency on capital and commercial plans attracts real money and limits fast-money churn.

---

**To sum up:**  
$ATYR is now one of the purest Phase 3 setups in US biotech: a single-asset, tight-float, institutionally dominated, orphan-designated, first-in-class play, with commercial and regulatory scarcity, structural options asymmetry, and a management team trusted by institutions. Reported institutional ownership understates the real figure; the “true” float is likely almost locked. In my opinion, both the upside and downside here are magnified as much by structure as by data. The next move will not be gradual.

---

## 3. Market Behaviour Around Phase 3 Catalysts: Run-Up, Event Reaction, and Post-Event Drift

The price action around Phase 3 biotech events follows a recognisable—though never fully predictable—pattern shaped by information flow, risk appetite, capital constraints, trading structure, and psychology. Each company’s journey through the run-up, event, and aftermath is defined by its structure, but certain recurring dynamics are worth unpacking.

---

### A. The Run-Up: Hype, Drift, and Selective Accumulation

In classic Phase 3 setups with binary risk and concentrated ownership, prices typically drift upward as the catalyst nears—often accelerating in the final weeks. Multiple forces drive this:

#### 1. Information Leakage and Smart Money

- Information or sentiment frequently leaks ahead of announcements, via clinicaltrials.gov updates, analyst chatter, rumours, or even management body language.
- Well-resourced funds use channel checks and clinical site intelligence to position early, producing a slow, persistent grind higher in the 1–4 months pre-event, especially if management appears confident.

#### 2. Institutional vs. Retail Run-Ups

- In institutionally dominated names like $ATYR, run-ups tend to be orderly, marked by rising volume, tight spreads, and block trades.
- In retail-driven “hype” names, the run-up is volatile and prone to sharp reversals—even before the event—due to speculative option flows and less disciplined trading.
- For $ATYR, with float constraints and growing hedge fund/crossover presence, the run-up is likely to be controlled but strong, with block trades and pockets of sudden moves on new information.

#### 3. Options Market Dynamics

- Implied volatility (IV) rises as the event nears, reflecting both increased demand for exposure and supply/demand imbalances as dealers hedge.
- Call open interest at key strikes ($6, $7.50, $10) amplifies price drift as dealers hedge, reinforcing moves—especially in small- and mid-caps with tight floats.

#### 4. Run-Up Ceiling and FOMO

- Eventually, the run-up stalls—either because most buyers are already positioned, or because event risk becomes too binary for new capital.
- For $ATYR, expect a measured run-up with bursts of sharp moves on news or technical triggers, but unless the float is fully locked, there’s always potential for late buyers as the event window narrows and FOMO sets in.

---

### B. Event Day: The Anatomy of the Catalyst Move

#### 1. Fat Tails and Asymmetry

- Empirical data confirms that Phase 3 events produce fat-tailed, asymmetric returns: losses are usually larger and more frequent than gains. Median moves are +10–15% for wins, –20–50% for losses in single-asset names.
- Tight floats and loaded options chains, as with $ATYR, magnify these effects.

#### 2. Microstructure Effects

- Event day moves depend as much on who owns the float as on the data. With high institutional ownership, moves are sharp and liquidity can vanish as buyers and sellers avoid wide spreads.
- Heavy short interest or clustered option strikes (gamma walls) can cause forced covering or pinning, fueling disorderly rallies or drops.
- For $ATYR, a clean win could trigger stepwise repricing as institutions absorb short covering and retail demand. A miss could cause a rapid liquidity vacuum and a steep drop.

#### 3. Second-Day Effects

- Most initial reaction happens in the first 15–60 minutes, but aftershocks play out as profits are taken or new money chases in or exits.
- Dealers unwinding options hedges can exacerbate post-catalyst volatility.

**In my opinion:**  
What matters most isn’t the headline move but the flow quality in the first hour—do institutions absorb size? Does price hold above key levels? Is options dealer activity reinforcing or unwinding the move?

---

### C. Post-Event Drift: Mean Reversion and New Narratives

#### 1. Drift Back to Fundamentals

- Abnormal returns fade, and volume normalises as the market digests results and re-anchors to fundamentals.
- Positive moves often retrace 50% in 1–2 days if well anticipated or only incrementally positive; negative outcomes can see continued grinding lower.

#### 2. Information Cycle Reset

- After the binary event, narrative focus pivots to “what’s next”—NDA timelines, commercial plans, M&A speculation, or new trials.
- For $ATYR, a win will shift attention to NDA filing, payer feedback, partnering, and pipeline expansion—each a potential new volatility event.

#### 3. Accumulation or Distribution

- Post-event, price is often dictated by whether institutions are adding or exiting. Scarcity of credible assets can mean any weakness is bought, underpinning a higher floor.
- Disappointing results, mixed data, or uncertainty can lead to a slow, painful grind as weak hands capitulate.

**For $ATYR:**  
A positive result should see any retrace met by real accumulation, given float scarcity and institutional interest. On a miss, expect overshooting to the downside until sellers clear.

---

### D. Structure Dictates Behaviour

- **Pipeline breadth:** Diversified companies see muted moves; $ATYR’s single-asset risk amplifies impact.
- **Ownership:** High institutional/insider concentration means sharper, more orderly moves; fragmented retail floats are chaotic.
- **Short/options:** Crowded shorts and heavy options can force outsized moves as hedges unwind.
- **Regulatory context:** Orphan/fast-track status, unmet need, and lack of competition (all true for $ATYR) drive up both scarcity and willingness to pay.
- **Liquidity:** Thin, expensive-to-borrow floats are primed for squeezes on upside surprises.

**In my view:**  
If you want to model behaviour, don’t just look at the event—study the structure. $ATYR’s setup is as asymmetric as they come: single-asset, tight float, deep institutional ownership, loaded calls, and orphan status. The Phase 3 readout is a true market crucible.

---

## 4. Event Study Findings: Volatility, Returns, and the Valuation Gap That Drives It All

It’s a persistent myth that you can “model” biotech price reactions using historical averages. Reality is much more chaotic, because price is driven by the magnitude of the gap between current market cap and potential post-catalyst value.

---

### A. Fat Tails and the Valuation Gap

Academic studies show Phase 3 catalyst reactions are fat-tailed and asymmetric:

- **Negative outcomes:** Single-asset names can lose 50–80% overnight.
- **Positive outcomes:** Most “wins” deliver +10–30%, but only a handful—where the valuation gap is extreme—double, triple, or more in days.
- **Ambiguous results:** “Not quite good enough” can trigger gap-downs if optimism was already priced in.

**Why?**  
The biggest moves come from stocks where the valuation gap is huge and the event is truly existential—as is the case with $ATYR.

---

### B. $ATYR: Quantifying the Jackpot and the Risk

As of June 2025, $ATYR’s market cap is ~$457M. If efzofitimod succeeds in sarcoidosis:

- **US patients:** 150,000–160,000
- **Net price:** “Low $100,000s” per year
- **10% share:** $1.5B revenue
- **Rare disease M&A multiples:** 6–10x sales = $9–15B US valuation
- **Gap:** 20–30x current cap—before accounting for ex-US or pipeline expansion

If the trial fails, value could drop by 50–80%—back to cash.

**Key point:**  
This “valuation gap” is the fuel behind both parabolic upside and existential downside.

---

### C. Volatility and Volume Amplification

- **Implied volatility:** ATYR’s options price in >100% IV—market expects a 50–100% move.
- **Realised volatility:** Events like the June 4 SSC-ILD readout drove >3M shares traded in a day (>4% of float); approaching Phase 3, moves could be even larger.
- **Float:** With 86M shares and likely >70% institutional ownership, a win could trigger a violent scramble for shares as shorts and FOMO buyers chase limited supply.

---

### D. Why Averages Mislead

- **Large-cap, diversified names:** Moves are minor, even on major events.
- **$ATYR:** The whole company is binary; float can reprice in hours.

**In my view:**  
Anyone leaning on historical averages, or treating this as a coin flip, misses the real drivers: how much of the future is priced in ahead of time, and how big the remaining gap is at the event.

---

### E. Anatomy of the Run-Up

Empirical studies show a “pre-event drift”—the run-up before the catalyst:

- **Information leakage:** Smart money often moves early.
- **Crowd behaviour:** As the valuation gap narrative spreads, more buyers pile in.

For $ATYR, price has run from under $4 to $5.38 post-SSC-ILD/Jefferies, as the gap began to close but hasn’t been fully priced in.

- **Retail-driven run-ups:** Reverse quickly if the event underwhelms.
- **Institutional-driven float tightening:** Creates real right-tail risk—a win can force a short squeeze and catch the sell side flat-footed.

**Risk:**  
If price closes too much of the gap pre-event (e.g., $10–15), upside gets capped and left-tail risk dominates. If skepticism persists, the right tail remains open for an outsized move.

---

### F. Structure Determines Destiny—$ATYR as an Outlier

What makes $ATYR an outlier:

- Single-asset, rare disease, binary outcome
- Tight float (~86M shares), high/rising institutional ownership
- Orphan/fast-track, no near-term dilution risk
- High short interest, loaded options chain
- 20–30x gap between cap and modelled value

**The way I see it:**  
$ATYR is a pure test of the “valuation-gap-driven” repricing that defines modern biotech. When the float is thin and conviction is high, both tails are fatter than any average—and each tick can be decisive.

---

**To sum up:**  
The valuation gap is not just academic—it drives both risk and reward. For $ATYR, the gap is so wide that any win could reprice the company overnight, while a loss could vaporise its value. Everything between now and the readout—every trade, option, and new buyer or seller—will be anchored to this gap.

**For retail investors:**  
This isn’t about averages or modelled reactions. It’s about knowing what’s at stake, how sentiment can flip, and how structure drives outcomes in crowded, high-stakes markets.

---

## 5. Market Structure, Crowd Behaviour, and Reflexivity Around Phase 3 Catalysts

Strip away the headlines and models and you’ll find that price and volume around a major Phase 3 event are driven by market structure, participant positioning, and the reflexive interplay of narrative and behaviour. For a setup like $ATYR—with a crowded trade and a massive valuation gap—this dynamic can be as impactful as the trial result itself.

---

### A. The Role of Market Microstructure: Who Owns and Trades the Float?

- **Institutional Ownership:** As of mid-May 2025, reported institutional ownership in $ATYR was ~70%, but this data lags by months. Given the 11% QoQ growth rate and strong post-readout flows, real control is likely higher—perhaps 75%+. The upshot: only a small fraction of the float is actually “loose” and available to trade as the catalyst approaches, with most shares in the hands of funds, crossovers, and long-onlys.
- **Retail and Social Holders:** The rest is held by deeply convicted retail—many “locked in” for the readout—and a smaller set of swing traders who provide liquidity but little real supply. In my opinion, a committed retail cohort (see r/CountryDumb) actually reduces available float and amplifies any price move.
- **Short Interest:** $ATYR maintains notable short interest (recently 14–15% of float, subject to borrow fluctuations). This adds a reflexive element: if momentum turns positive, shorts may be forced to cover into a vanishing float, compounding any move well beyond what fundamental models would predict.

---

### B. Options Structure and Dealer Positioning: The Reflexivity Engine

- **Loaded Options Chain:** The $ATYR options chain is “live” at multiple strikes ($6, $7.50, $10), with high open interest and IV above 100%. This creates a dynamic feedback loop—dealers hedge as spot moves, buying or selling shares, which can amplify both upward squeezes and downside volatility.
- **Gamma and Vega:** When call OI clusters just above spot, a break of those strikes forces more dealer buying (delta hedging), accelerating the move. If price stalls and IV collapses, rapid “volatility crush” can occur as call buyers rush to exit.

---

### C. Crowd Psychology and Reflexive Narratives

- **Pre-Event Anticipation:** In my view, much of the pre-catalyst run-up isn’t about information leakage, but about collective anticipation. As the “valuation gap” narrative spreads on Reddit, Twitter, and among institutions, conviction begets more positioning in a self-reinforcing loop.
- **Post-Event Whiplash:** Immediately after the event, markets are chaotic and “gap-driven.” For positive results, liquidity dries up as shorts and traders scramble to cover, fueling FOMO and often exceeding rational valuation. On negative/ambiguous news, buyers evaporate and price can overshoot to the downside as forced sellers crowd the exits.
- **Mean-Reversion vs. Re-Rating:** After the initial chaos, stocks seek a new equilibrium. A true outlier win can mean weeks of steady grinding higher as new institutional money arrives; ambiguous or underwhelming results tend to see price revert toward cash value, sometimes overshooting.

---

### D. Why $ATYR’s Structure Magnifies Reflexive Extremes

- **Thin, Locked Float:** With most shares in strong hands and borrow tight, any new buyer (or short covering) can cause outsized moves. The effect is amplified when the binary catalyst is high-profile and linked to a multi-billion-dollar gap.
- **Social Amplification:** Vocal, research-driven communities (e.g., r/CountryDumb) “anchor” expectations, making valuation targets semi-self-fulfilling if enough capital believes the story.
- **Dealer and Market Maker Hedging:** Options-driven regimes can both dampen and amplify moves, depending on whether dealers are long or short gamma at key strikes. $ATYR’s chain currently implies a pinning effect up to $6, with squeeze potential above if positioning builds.

---

**In summary:**  
The core lesson is that structure and psychology can drive outcomes as powerfully as the data itself. For $ATYR, the combination of high institutional ownership, a locked float, loaded options, and a deeply engaged retail crowd means the Phase 3 event will be shaped by pre-existing positioning as much as by the press release.

If you’re sizing, timing, or hedging into a binary like this, understanding these reflexive loops is—in my view—crucial. It’s here that retail sometimes finds an edge over slower-moving institutional capital.

---

## 6. What It All Means for Retail Investors: Lessons, Pitfalls, and Strategic Perspective

Years of watching and living through high-stakes biotech events have convinced me these moments are defined as much by your approach as by the outcome. The frameworks I’ve outlined are guides, not guarantees. This isn’t a manual—it’s an invitation to think strategically about risk, structure, and narrative in $ATYR and beyond.

---

### A. The Myth of Predictability—Every Event Is Unique

- **No Two Setups Alike:** Every Phase 3 has its own microstructure, crowding, and options ecosystem—even with clear historical analogues or valuation gaps.
- **Model Risk:** Averages and analogues can mislead. Fat tails—positive or negative—occur more frequently when structure and psychology interact.
- **Ambiguity and Drift:** Not every outcome is a clear win or fail. Ambiguous data often sparks narrative battles, with price whiplash in the days following.

---

### B. Sizing, Risk, and Time Horizons—What Matters Most

- **Sizing for the Tails:** In my view, surviving the left tail (the drawdown risk) matters more than chasing a 300% gain. Single-asset biotech events are existential; position accordingly.
- **Time Horizon Discipline:** Big right-tail outcomes rarely settle in one tick. Even after a win, new money, covering, and institutional buying play out over days or weeks. Disappointment can mean days of forced selling.
- **Liquidity:** In thin-float names, executing size (or exiting) can be hard. Market orders can be dangerous in the volatility after a catalyst.

---

### C. Information Flow and Narrative Control

- **Chaotic Readouts:** Catalyst days are dominated by algos, headlines, and fast-money traders. Early price moves may not reflect true data quality.
- **Narrative Anchoring:** The initial story—on Twitter, Reddit, or in sell-side notes—often shapes the next few sessions. Clean wins with clear valuation gaps close fast; ambiguous results invite debate, mean reversion, or delayed rallies.
- **Institutional vs. Retail:** Retail can move a float short-term, but institutional follow-through determines lasting re-ratings. Watching block trades and post-event filings gives valuable clues.

---

### D. Opportunity and Trap

- **Opportunity:** When the valuation gap is huge, float is locked, and reflexive feedback loops are active (as in $ATYR), the conditions for outlier moves are in place. The outcome still depends on execution, data quality, and—critically—how much is priced in.
- **Trap:** Crowd consensus can be dangerous—social-driven conviction often overstates the odds of success and downplays the risk. Emotional certainty isn’t risk management. The wider the gap, the bigger the pain if it closes the wrong way.

---

### E. Strategic Takeaways—My Own Framing

The $ATYR setup, as of June 2025, is about as pure an asymmetric event structure as exists in US biotech:
- **Structural Asymmetry:** $457M cap, likely >70% institutional ownership, high short interest, loaded options—all ingredients for an outsized move.
- **Valuation Gap:** Real addressable market and price assumptions suggest a 20x+ theoretical gap; if the data are clean, the move could be huge.
- **Risk Management:** I focus less on upside and more on what I can survive if things go wrong. A vocal, high-conviction crowd can drive both melt-ups and panics.
- **Tactical Flexibility:** I’m watching options OI, block volume, and pre-event drift for clues on when the “gap” might close. If price runs too far, I’ll reduce risk; if skepticism remains, post-event risk/reward looks best.

---

### F. For You: Pursuing Understanding

The goal isn’t a map, but a sharper compass. I encourage you to take these frameworks, do your own research, and be honest about the risks you’re taking. My aim is to close the information asymmetry between retail and institutions—sharing the synthesis, theory, and empirical patterns I’ve spent years developing.

There’s no crystal ball. Markets are always messier than any model. The best edge, in my opinion, is a clear-eyed, adaptive approach—focused on understanding, not prediction, and on continual refinement.

Apply these principles not just to $ATYR, but to any high-stakes, event-driven setup. The pursuit of understanding is what sets you apart from the crowd, and it’s why I put in the hours on these deep dives—to help level the playing field.

---

## 7. Conclusion & Next Steps: What This Deep Dive Means and Where We Go From Here

If you’ve made it this far, you know this was never meant to be a simple “here’s what happens after a Phase 3” post. The reality, as I hope you’ve seen, is that every high-stakes biotech event—especially with a company as structurally unique as $ATYR—is defined by layers: market structure, ownership, valuation gap, float dynamics, and the psychological battleground of retail and institutional flows. You can’t reduce the setup to a few historical averages or bullet-point rules of thumb.

In my view, the real lesson is about context, discipline, and the power of understanding. It’s about recognising how asymmetric risk and reward are engineered not just by trial outcomes, but by the entire configuration of market forces leading into the event. And it’s about learning to see these setups—whether for $ATYR or the next rare-disease catalyst—not as lottery tickets, but as exercises in probabilistic thinking, scenario planning, and continuous process refinement.

For you, as a reader and member of this community:  
Think of this post not as a map, but as a set of lenses. My hope is that you walk away with a sharper, more nuanced view of what’s at stake—not just for $ATYR, but for any event-driven setup you’ll encounter in the future. I want you to ask better questions, build better frameworks, and avoid the trap of thinking you have to predict every move to benefit from the game.

we order the same thing EVERY sunday.
she calls out 3 iced salted caramel lattes.
i say salted caramel mochas?
she says ""oh. is it ok if i just add a ton of chocolate in them so i don't have to remake them?""

the syrup sticks to the bottom, we love the salted caramel mochas because they are made w chocolate milk.

i say ok, bc she made me feel like id be a bitch for asking for the 3 drinks i ordered to be made correctly.
we got them, didnt like them, and asked for them to be remade. we were appreciative and left an extra 5$ tip.

as a barista, id NEVER ask a customer if i could try and salvage my mistake instead of making someones order correctly. i get its annoying but its part of the job. plus it would look bad on me.

Originally, I was prescribed the medication for ADHD tendencies, and for weight loss. It took me two weeks to start the medication because of all the feedback I would see. My first day I felt very alert, but I also had a little too much coffee so that’s that. All I did was drink extra water that day and I was fine right before bedtime but no sleeping interruptions. Yesterday, my second day, I was very mellow just like my first day but more on the relaxed side. I’ve had no issues sleeping with the medication so far. Today is day three I have already taken my medication. I stepped-on the scale because I’ve been feeling like I haven’t been craving much food and I’m down about 3 to 4 pounds. I must admit I’m not all that hungry throughout the day. What I once would crave I really don’t crave which is sour candy and diet soda. Because I have an autoimmune which I also take medication for and it does drop my sugar levels sometimes having candy with me, helps me out.

1l73nzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1l73nzu/try_try_try_until_you_make_it/,TRY. TRY. TRY. UNTIL YOU MAKE IT,"Hey guys,

I just wanted to share a little encouragement today, for anyone who’s staring at a blinking cursor or wondering if this whole “being a writer” dream is worth chasing.

It *is*. It absolutely is.

Writing a book takes serious discipline. It's not just about bursts of inspiration or late-night coffee-fueled sprints (though those help). It’s about showing up—day after day, even when it’s hard, even when the words feel clunky, even when you doubt yourself. You try, and then you try again. That’s how the magic happens. Not overnight, but gradually—word by word.

I’m still on my own journey. Still learning. Still pushing through that self-doubt and that “is this even good?” voice in my head. But every page is a small victory, and I know one day, with enough tries, I’ll be the author I dream of being.

And maybe you will too. Maybe you already are, even if you don’t feel like it yet. Just don’t give up.

Lately, I’ve been building something on the side too, a little tool I created to help organize writing projects, track progress, and keep myself on track when motivation wavers. It's honestly as much for me as it is for anyone else. If it ends up being helpful to others too, maybe it’ll even help me earn enough to go full-time author someday. That’s the dream, right?

Anyway, whether you’re 5 pages in or 5 rewrites deep—keep going. Try, try, try... until you make it. You don’t have to be great today. Just be consistent. Great will come.

Much love and writing strength to all of you.

Stopping my friendship with my coworker because she demanded me give her more money,"Yesterday a server assistant demanded my tips. For context, this girl and I are friends. I always get her coffee before our shifts and on days that are slower I’ll buy food off our menu for her. I gave her extra tips on days I made over a hundred because she helps out a lot and I want her to feel appreciated. 

Yesterday was extremely slow for a Sunday. I worked 8 hours and made $90 before tip share. After tip share I made about 72ish dollars. Most of that money that gets taken out goes to server assistants. 

Yesterday  was so slow that I delivered everything but one tray of food. I brought my planner in to plan my week and she took one of my nice pens in front of me and said she was gonna take it. I told her that I’d give her any other pen but I really liked those for my planner, she said I was being selfish and stingy. Maybe I am over pens but I just think it’s something nice id like for myself, peaceful sundays planning with pretty pens. 

I was trying to leave yesterday but she stood between me and the posi and wouldn’t let me leave without giving her extra tips. I explained to her today (as I’ve done several times) that she gets paid an hourly rate if 8 while I get $2. she already got 13 dollars of my $90 ( she knew I had $90 because she would steal my check out “playfully” and talk about how much money I made) I pointed out on my checkout the 13 she will be getting from me and I really made only $70 for this shift but she didnot care. I gave her $10 because I know she doesn’t like the living situation she’s in and I think she just felt bad. 

I finally was able to clock out and leave but it made me feel dumb. She knew that I am going through medical debt cause my dad was dying, and yet I had more sympathy for her not getting along with her roommates. 

I’m gonna stop being friends with her and return her bracelet she gave me recently. I might be overreacting, but I don’t want to be friends with someone who is like this. Thinks that I owe her my pension or tips. 

Let me know if I’m overreacting. I just feel like it’s that saying of give someone an inch they’ll take mile.

1l73bbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticdiscussions/comments/1l73bbh/the_real_problem_with_the_democrats_ground_game/,The Real Problem With the Democrats’ Ground Game,"By Russell Berman

They called it the “Big Send.” Democrats gathered in living rooms, libraries, and coffee shops across the country to write letters to millions of potential voters in swing states and competitive congressional districts, urging them to vote in November. During the 2020 pandemic election, the novel but decidedly 20th-century tactic had cut through the glut of digital messages that inundated Americans’ cellphones and inboxes, and organizers hoped it would similarly boost turnout for Democrats in 2024.
It did not.

In a study set to be released later today, the group behind the letter-writing effort, the nonpartisan Vote Forward, found that personal messages sent to more than 5 million occasional voters deemed at risk of staying home last fall had no effect on turnout. (The group’s campaign produced a modest increase in turnout among a second, slightly smaller set of low-propensity voters, but it still fell short of previous Vote Forward programs.) What’s unusual is not Vote Forward’s lackluster findings, but that the group is ready to tell the world about them. Every election, a constellation of progressive organizations sells donors and volunteers on the promise that their data-driven turnout programs will deliver victory at the polls. These mobilization efforts have taken on ever-greater importance in an era of tight elections, where the presidency and majorities in Congress can hinge on just a few thousand votes.

Progressive groups are only too happy to brag about their wins; they’re much less likely to divulge details about their campaigns that flopped. Driving this reticence is a fear that donations will dry up—or go to other organizations in a highly competitive campaign industry—if funders find out their money made little difference on the ground. In several instances, researchers told me, Democratic firms have either pushed them to suppress the results of studies that didn’t produce desired findings or cherry-picked data to make the numbers look better. “We have a people-pleasing problem in our party,” Max Wood, a progressive data scientist, told me.
Yasmin Radjy, the executive director of Vote Forward and its progressive campaign arm, Swing Left, is trying to change that culture. Just as Democrats are now debating, sometimes fiercely, why their party’s message failed last year, Radjy believes that to emerge from “the political wilderness,” they need to have candid conversations about their organizing and turnout efforts. Radjy has been frustrated by what she describes as Democrats’ lack of introspection and transparency. For months, she’s been asking party organizers and consultants what they learned in 2024, and what they’re going to do differently going forward. “We’ve got to actually be honest about both what works and what doesn’t work,” she told me. In the next election, “if we are serving volunteers, donors, and voters reheated leftovers from 2024, we are doing it wrong.”
...
During the Obama era, Democrats relied on support from infrequent voters to capture the presidency, although they struggled in low-turnout, off-year elections. They poured millions of dollars into research and organizing programs to identify and mobilize those voters. But since then, the parties’ bases have shifted, and many of these hard-to-reach voters became Donald Trump supporters—especially working-class white voters and, in 2024, a large number of young and nonwhite people
Some Democrats worry that their party’s vaunted turnout operation has, in recent years, produced a significant number of votes for Trump, reducing, if not negating, the benefits for their own candidates. Early last year, a top progressive data scientist warned donors in a memo that if Democratic mobilization groups “were to blindly register nonvoters,” they could be “distinctly aiding Trump’s quest for a personal dictatorship,” The Washington Post reported.
Radjy acknowledged that had been a concern, but she said Vote Forward’s postelection study found no evidence that its letter-writing campaign helped Trump or Republicans. “If we found that, it would hurt, but we would also share it transparently,” she told me.
It’s not clear that everyone else would. The biggest spenders in Democratic politics frequently test their turnout operations, in many cases through randomized controlled trials in which one group of people receives a particular form of engagement—a door knock, phone call, or text message, for example—while another gets nothing. (This is what Vote Forward did to test its letter-writing success.) After the election, organizers can check to see which group voted at a higher rate. These findings have shown that in presidential-election years, traditional canvassing methods have become less effective as voters get bombarded with campaign ads and reminders to vote. “In a saturated environment, it’s getting harder and harder for individual pieces of campaign communication to break through,” David Broockman, a political scientist at UC Berkeley who studies voting behavior, told me. “I expect the effects of everything are just going to keep on going down.”
...
Democrats can take some solace in the fact that the nation’s rightward shift last year was much smaller in the states where they campaigned most aggressively. That suggests that the hundreds of millions of dollars they poured into advertising and voter-turnout efforts did make a difference. And even the best ground game cannot overcome a flawed candidate or message.

But the party’s defeat is accelerating a broader questioning of its organizing and ability to connect with the millions of voters who are up for grabs in presidential-election years. “Democrats have much bigger problems on their hands than what they’re doing on the doors at the end of the election,” said Billy Wimsatt, the founder of the progressive Movement Voter Project, a clearinghouse for donors to Democratic groups. He said the party needs to learn from the success of the well-funded MAGA movement, which he calls a “vertically integrated meta church” that, “feels like one big purpose-driven team,” even with all its faults. “Their billionaires are savvier than our billionaires,” Wimsatt told me, “and they’re more interested in winning.”
Wimsatt is one of many Democrats who believe that the party needs to invest in much deeper engagement with voters—outreach that must start long before an election. So does Radjy: “We need to be talking to people earlier,” she said. “We need to be talking to people in a more curious and reciprocal way.” But first comes honesty about what went wrong in 2024. Democrats will appreciate it. They might even demand it. “Even candor that is not rosy,” Radjy told me, “is more appealing than rosy bullshit.”
