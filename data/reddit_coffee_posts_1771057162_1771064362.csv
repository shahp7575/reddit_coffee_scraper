1r4h5yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltBeautyHub/comments/1r4h5yj/finally_leaned_into_my_chaotic_curator_vibe_dark/,Finally leaned into my chaotic curator vibe: Dark academia meets '90s grunge with a touch of moonlight shimmer (spent way too long blending that shadow 🦇),"Okay, so you know how sometimes you see those super elaborate *literary gothic* eye looks on Pinterest and think, ""But how do I make that work for, like, *leaving the house* without looking like I'm auditioning for a vampire flick?"" Yeah, me too. I wanted to capture that moody, slightly undone intellectual vibe for everyday, leaning into a *chaotic curator* meets *functionalist* approach to a dark eye. The goal: a subtle intensity that felt more ""spent all night reading obscure texts"" than ""spent all night clubbing.""

My challenge was to create a smudgy, smoked-out look using deep, almost-black shades without it looking heavy or unapproachable in daylight. I'm definitely not a pro MUA, so my technique tends to be more ""hope and pray"" than ""precision artistry."" This experiment was all about finding that sweet spot.

Here’s a breakdown of what went down:

*   **The Aesthetic Goal:** Think worn leather-bound books, old velvet, a touch of academic melancholy, but still able to grab a coffee without stares. A true ""reverie escapist"" who occasionally has to rejoin reality.
*   **Key Products Used:**
    *   **Eyeshadow Primer:** (Any drugstore option, usually around $7-12). Essential for stopping the smudge from migrating too far.
    *   **Deep Charcoal Matte Eyeshadow:** (Used a single pan from an indie brand, roughly $8). Not quite black, but very deep grey.
    *   **Forest Green or Deep Plum Matte Eyeshadow:** (Another indie single, around $8). This was my secret weapon for unexpected depth.
    *   **Soft Black Kohl Eyeliner Pencil:** (My go-to drugstore brand, around $6). Something that truly smudges easily.
    *   **Mascara:** (Volumizing formula, mid-range, $15-20). Didn't want too much drama on the lashes, just definition.
*   **My (Evolving) Technique:**
    1.  **Prep:** Applied primer to the lid and lower lash line. Let it set for a minute.
    2.  **Liner Base:** Lined the upper lash line and waterline with the kohl pencil. I didn't worry about being neat at all. This was meant to be smudged!
    3.  **Initial Smudge:** Immediately, while the kohl was still soft, I took a small, dense smudge brush and buffed out the upper lash line, extending it slightly outwards in a soft wing shape. For the lower lash line, I used an even lighter hand, just blurring it slightly.
    4.  **Charcoal Anchor:** Using a flat shader brush, I patted the charcoal eyeshadow over the smudged liner on the upper lid, focusing on the lash line and diffusing it up towards the crease. I used a clean fluffy brush to blend the edges, trying to keep it concentrated.
    5.  **The Unexpected Twist:** This is where the *real talk* comes in. My first attempt looked... flat. Just a grey blob. So, for the second go, I took a tiny amount of the *forest green* eyeshadow on a pencil brush and lightly pressed it onto the very outer corner of my upper and lower lash lines, just over the charcoal. Then I blended it *just slightly* with the fluffy brush. This added a subtle, almost imperceptible shift in color that made the whole look more dimensional and less harsh, leaning into that *'90s alt* grunge with a refined edge.
    6.  **Final Touches:** A quick coat of mascara on top lashes only. I skipped bottom lash mascara to keep it from looking too heavy for daytime.
*   **Time Invested:** Around 15-20 minutes, mostly because I kept blending and adjusting.

**Real Talk & Lessons Learned:**

My first try was a hot mess, honestly. I went in too heavy with the kohl and then too aggressively with the charcoal, and it just looked like a bruised eye rather than a carefully curated smudge. It was a classic case of ""more is less"" when it comes to blending dark colors. The biggest lesson was learning to build up the color in thin layers and blend, blend, blend until my arm hurt, especially around the edges.

The surprise hero was definitely that hint of forest green. I was worried it would be too much, but it added a subtle complexity that made the charcoal feel less stark and more integrated, giving it that lived-in, slightly mysterious vibe I was aiming for. It really softened the whole look without sacrificing the depth. It actually felt more *functionalist* in its application – using a precise touch of color to achieve a specific, subtle effect.

This wasn't about perfection; it was about the process and finding something that felt authentic to a certain mood. The end result wasn't ""flawless"" by conventional beauty standards, but it was exactly the kind of brooding, intelligent smudge I was going for.

My main concern right now is I’m afraid I don’t actually have ADHD and I’m getting high off Ritalin. I’ve never done drugs before so I’m not sure how I should be feeling if I were high.

Taking Ritalin for the first time made me feel the same way as I had when I drank coffee for the first time. Insanely zen and grounded (…?). I’ve always relied on caffeine but Ritalin felt like caffeine pro max plus if that’s even possible. Like I’ve never felt so focused like grounded it’s just astounding and hard to describe. I don’t think this is how normal people feel?? Like it’s too calm and too sedated feeling, not sleepy but just too relaxed to be normal?

I always had a fidgeting problem and on Ritalin I was pretty much still and I felt like I was moving slower with more intention? I felt concerned by that because I felt like my arms and legs were practically weighed down and I felt no reason to move them at all. I felt stoned and relaxed(?!)

Before all these I was always restless in a way. Swivelling my chair, shaking my leg like it’s no one’s business and spinning a pen. But I felt weighed down and with no reason to move? I’m not even sure if Ritalin was supposed to help in this way and I’m worried I’m basically abusing meds.

I can’t tell if I was getting high and I’m now worried. Especially because I read somewhere that stimulants is suppose to give everyone mental clarity and increase their focus anyway. I felt stoned, like when I drank coffee, only at a much much higher intensity.

Am I getting high off Ritalin?? The meds just wore off and I’m feeling so tired and slightly nauseous. The psychiatrist warned me of anxiety and heart palpitations but I only felt palpitations and nausea as it was wearing off. Is this supposed to happen?

I used to think Valentine’s Day was this giant spotlight on everything I don’t have.

No partner.

No cute plans.

No roses.

Just me scrolling through everyone else’s highlight reel.

But this year feels different.

I took myself out for coffee. Sat alone. No phone for an hour. Just watched people. Couples laughing, some arguing, some looking bored out of their minds. And it hit me  half of them aren’t even happy. They’re just not single.

We hype relationships like they automatically fix loneliness. They don’t. If anything, the wrong one makes it louder.

So yeah, I’m alone today.

But I’m also peaceful.

No pretending. No forcing conversations. No buying gifts out of obligation.

Just working on myself gym, career, fixing my messed-up habits, trying to become someone I’d actually want to date.

Maybe next Valentine’s I’ll have someone. Maybe not.

But I’d rather show up whole than desperate.

***The Keeper’s Introduction:***

*Welcome, shadow-seekers, to another thread in the Hollow’s unraveling. I’m The Keeper, your guide through the dark, where truths lurk just beyond the headlights. Tonight’s tale is about a drive you’ll never forget—a road where the rearview mirror shows more than you bargained for. Some truths are better left unseen, folks, but the Hollow doesn’t care what you want. Buckle up, and let’s peer into the shadows together.*

**The Whisper in the Rearview**

The rain was a steady hiss against my windshield, blurring the world into streaks of gray and neon. I was halfway through a six-hour drive from my sister’s place in Mill Creek to my apartment in the city, the kind of late-night haul that makes your eyes ache and your thoughts drift. My name’s Clara, and I’m not one for long drives—too much time alone with my head. I’ve always had this nervous habit of tapping my fingers on the steering wheel, like I’m playing some invisible piano to keep the quiet at bay. Tonight, the quiet was louder than usual.

It was just past midnight, and the highway stretched out like a black ribbon, flanked by endless pines that swallowed the moonlight. My old hatchback rattled along, the heater wheezing to keep the autumn chill out. I’d been fighting a gnawing unease all evening, a feeling I couldn’t pin down. Maybe it was the fight I’d had with my sister—her accusing me of running from responsibility, of always choosing the easy way out. Or maybe it was the stories I’d grown up with, the ones kids whispered at sleepovers. You know the one: the woman driving alone, unaware of the killer in the backseat, only saved by a stranger’s warning. I’d laughed it off as a kid, but out here, with the rain and the dark pressing in, it didn’t feel so funny.

I adjusted my rearview mirror, catching a glimpse of my own tired eyes. The backseat was empty, of course—just my duffel bag and a crumpled coffee cup. Still, I kept glancing back, that old urban legend worming into my head. Check the backseat, Clara. Just in case. I shook it off, cranking the radio to drown out the thought. Static crackled through the speakers, the signal fading as I dipped into a valley. The music cut out entirely, replaced by a low, rhythmic hum—like someone breathing, slow and deliberate, just behind my seat.

I froze, my fingers halting mid-tap. The sound was gone as soon as I noticed it, swallowed by the rain’s drone. “Get a grip,” I muttered, but my heart was thudding. I flicked on the dome light, twisting to check the backseat again. Nothing. Just the bag, the cup, and a faint smell I hadn’t noticed before—something metallic, like old coins. I turned the light off, telling myself it was just nerves. But the hum came again, softer this time, like a whisper brushing the back of my neck.

The highway was deserted, no headlights in either direction. My phone had no signal, and the GPS had frozen on a blank map, the little arrow stuck in place. I pressed the gas, wanting to outrun the unease, but the hum grew louder, syncing with the rhythm of my pulse. It wasn’t coming from the radio or the engine—it was inside the car. My eyes darted to the rearview mirror, and for a split second, I swore I saw something move. A shadow, hunched and still, just behind my seat. I slammed on the brakes, the car skidding on the wet asphalt. The hum stopped. I whipped around, heart in my throat, but the backseat was empty.

I sat there, panting, the rain hammering the roof. “You’re losing it, Clara,” I whispered, but my voice sounded thin, like it wasn’t mine. I reached for my phone, desperate for a signal, but the screen was black, the battery dead despite being fully charged an hour ago. The metallic smell was stronger now, sharp and sour, like blood. I told myself it was the car, maybe a leak, but my hands were shaking as I started driving again. I needed to get to the next town, find a gas station, anything with light and people.

The hum returned, louder, more insistent. It wasn’t just a sound—it was a pull, like a hook in my chest, urging me to look in the mirror. I fought it, keeping my eyes on the road, but the urge was overwhelming, hypnotic. My fingers twitched toward the mirror, adjusting it against my will. The reflection showed the backseat, empty as ever, but something was wrong. The shadows were too thick, too solid, pooling in the corners like spilled ink. And then I saw it—a pair of eyes, pale and unblinking, staring back from the darkness.

I screamed, swerving into the next lane. The car fishtailed, tires screeching, but I managed to pull over onto the shoulder. I flung the door open, stumbling into the rain, not daring to look back. The cold bit into my skin, but I didn’t care—I needed out. I grabbed my flashlight from the glovebox and shone it into the backseat. Nothing. Just my bag, the cup, and that damn metallic smell. But the hum was still there, vibrating in my bones, and now it was forming words: “Look again.”

I slammed the door and backed away, the flashlight shaking in my hand. The rain soaked through my jacket, but I couldn’t move. The pull was stronger now, dragging my gaze back to the car. I didn’t want to look, but I couldn’t stop myself. I leaned closer, peering through the rear window. The shadows shifted, and there it was—a figure, hunched and featureless, sitting where I’d just looked. Its head tilted, like it was studying me, and the hum became a voice, low and guttural: “You can’t leave me.”

I bolted, running down the highway, the flashlight beam bouncing wildly. The rain stung my face, but the voice followed, echoing inside my skull. “You invited me in.” I didn’t know what it meant, but the words twisted my stomach, a sick realization creeping in. Had I done this? Had I let it in somehow, with my fear, my doubt, my stupid obsession with that damn story?

I ran until my lungs burned, the highway stretching endlessly ahead. No cars, no lights, just the rain and the voice. I don’t know how long I ran before I saw it—a gas station, its neon sign flickering like a dying star. I stumbled inside, dripping wet, the clerk looking up from his phone with a frown. “You okay, lady?” he asked, but I could barely speak. I begged for a phone, a ride, anything, but he just stared, his eyes narrowing. “You smell like blood,” he said, and my heart stopped.

I looked down. My hands were clean, but the metallic smell clung to me, thick and choking. The clerk backed away, reaching for something under the counter. “Stay there,” he said, but I was already turning, drawn back to the parking lot, to my car. It sat under the gas station’s lights, looking normal, almost innocent. But the hum was louder now, a chorus of whispers, and I knew—I knew—it was waiting.

I don’t remember walking back to the car. It was like my body wasn’t mine, each step pulled by that hypnotic force. I opened the driver’s door and slid inside, the hum wrapping around me like a blanket. The rearview mirror was tilted, showing the backseat, and there it was. Not just eyes now—a face, pale and wrong, its mouth stretched too wide, its teeth glinting like wet stones. It leaned forward, its breath hot on my neck, and whispered, “You’re mine now.”

I wanted to scream, to run, but my hands moved on their own, starting the engine. The car rolled forward, back onto the highway, the rain closing in. The figure didn’t move, but I felt its weight, its presence, pressing against my mind. And then it spoke again, its voice soft, almost tender: “You always knew I was here.”

The truth hit me like a knife. The urban legend, the story I’d laughed at, obsessed over, whispered to myself on lonely nights—it wasn’t just a story. It was a warning, a ritual. Every time I’d checked the backseat, every glance in the mirror, I’d been calling it, inviting it closer. The Hollow wasn’t just a place—it was me, my fear, my doubt, given form. And now it was here, riding with me, forever.

I’m still driving. The highway never ends, and the rain never stops. The figure’s always there, just out of sight, but I feel it. Its whispers are my thoughts now, its hum my heartbeat. I want to stop, to fight, but the pull is too strong. The mirror shows my face sometimes, but it’s not mine anymore. It’s hers. And she’s smiling.

***The Keepers Closing:***

*The Hollow’s a hungry thing, folks, and it feeds on what you give it. Clara gave it her fear, her doubt, and now she’s part of its endless road. What are you feeding it, I wonder? Subscribe if the Hollow’s still whispering to you. Let’s piece its mystery together—comment your theories below. But tread lightly.

1r4h1fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r4h1fe/dealing_with_a_complicated_situation_and_not/,Dealing With a Complicated Situation and Not Knowing How to Process Extremely Painful Feelings,"A controlling, toxic woman came between me and someone I care about immensely. She not only sabotaged chances for me with him romantically but she also somehow managed to twist the dynamics of my relationship with him in general to the point where I couldn’t even communicate with him as just a regular acquaintance, ask for favor as a friend, or interact with in any shape or form.

I don’t know what she does exactly to make him change the way he does every time, but he grow distant, cold, indifferent, and sometimes even resentful. It was extremely painful processing this after what my relationship with him was in the past. Amiable. Peaceful. Wonderful. Happy. Positive.

He’s done so many things to make her feel prioritized in front of me. It reached the point where I felt like at times I was being bullied for her sake. Ditched. Ignored. Stood up. It still doesn’t seem to be enough to convince her that he’s choosing her over me.

She continues to threat, appease, tantalize, sabotage.

We all function in the same community which I’m very happy being part of. I also still consider him a person I care about even if things didn’t work out romantically. It’s extremely painful seeing things between me and him improve a lot and get so close to being peaceful and then she shows up and does something to trigger and things flip upside down again.

I don’t want solutions to fix things externally, because I’m aware this is something I cannot control. What I wish I can achieve is help myself heal the wounds inside of me. The frustration of seeing her say extremely triggering things or do things that are immensely painful.

I’ll give examples of what I mean…

I bought him a gift that meant so much to me and took a lot of thought. Seeing him happy meant everything. He asked me to join him and another friend that same day to do an activity. She shows up during that time and asks him to dump everything. She did it again the following week.

She knows when I have plans with him and sabotaged every attempt then she shows up in my face and asks me what I’m doing.

When she managed to make him change with me, he somehow believed I did something against her. He stopped talking to me for 30 days. She knew and kept posting about her love life with him consistently.

He started avoiding me nonstop. I bought coffee for his staff so I bought one for him. He refused to sit with me in the same room alone. He keeps telling me he’s busy. Meanwhile she posts love poetry and cafe trips with someone she loves. She tells me to my face she’s there every day for hours. I watch him say things to her I no longer hear him. Literally asking her to stay in the place to have coffee with him and then when she left he told me to go and call her.

Her threat “don’t chase things that don’t belong to you or be in a place you’re not meant to be in. Go look around you’ll find something better. It’s mature to let go of things”

During the times and incidents when he would ditch or avoid, she takes the opportunity to rub salt in my wounds by criticizing my performance or saying really ridiculous things.

She’s extremely bossy and controlling

Even during times when I feel things are the worst, I can’t seem to help myself be removed from that situation because all I can hear are her words. I feel like I’m doing what I’m being told followed by her happy selfies and giddy behavior when I see her, plus triggering words, makes it impossible to even decide to move on without feeling like someone is rubbing it in my face.

I don’t mind dealing with psycho friends in someone’s life but this ability to change him and make him somehow flip against me is something I find mind boggling and extremely painful.

Like I said I don’t want solutions to fix anything. I just want to know how to deal with possibly being pushed away on the side and make peace with the fact that I didn’t matter at all. In any way. My feelings. My body. My personality. And all of that I somehow slowly started accepting. But now this burning sensation like I’m just doing what she wants.

This is specifically difficult for me to do because I never was the type that likes being told what to do. I fight conventions. I like feeling free to do things my way. I don’t know how to trick my brain in this situation to tell myself if and when I move on it’s my choice and not this b\*\*\*\* lecture.

I find it beyond unfair how she plants the poison to trigger

Gives you a lecture in a condescending cold way on how to move on from the thing she herself sabotaged

And then finally publicizes her joy with the world celebrating the exact thing she sabotaged.

The 2026 market demands hyper-personalization powered by predictive AI. It is no longer enough to broadcast a message; you must engage in a dialogue. Professional marketing services provide the data-driven insights necessary to understand the ""Whycation""—the specific personal goal driving a traveler's choice, whether it's a ""mental reset"" in the Highlands or a ""literary escape"" to the Cotswolds.These services bridge the gap between high-tech tools and high-touch storytelling. Agencies now use ""agentic AI"" to anticipate traveler intent, pushing relevant offers to users exactly when they are most likely to book. For instance, if a solo traveler in London searches for ""cooler holidays"" during a heatwave, professional marketing ensures a boutique hotel in the Peak District appears at the top of their feed. By choosing professional services, businesses can navigate the post-cookie world with first-party data strategies that respect privacy while delivering unmatched relevance. In an era where ""experience is everything,"" professional marketing is the engine that ensures your experience is the one that gets seen and chosen.

# Maximizing Search Visibility Through Targeted Travel SEO Services UK

The traditional search engine is evolving into an ""answer engine,"" where AI overviews provide direct, summarized solutions to traveler queries. To remain relevant, brands must invest in specialized [**travel SEO services UK**](https://localpage.uk/blog/category/travel) that go beyond simple keywords. Today, SEO is about building E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness). Google and other platforms now prioritize content that demonstrates first-hand experience—exactly what a solo traveler seeks. If your website can answer ""Where is the safest place for a solo female traveler in York?"" with nuance and local insight, you become the cited authority that AI engines trust.Furthermore, the rise of voice and visual search has transformed how people find travel information. A traveler might snap a photo of a landmark or ask their device for ""a boutique hotel under £150 with a view."" Specialized SEO ensures that your site is technically optimized to serve these modern queries. By focusing on ""zero-click"" opportunities and rich snippets, travel brands can capture attention even before a user clicks through to the site. In the competitive UK tourism landscape, being the ""single, trusted source of insight"" is the ultimate competitive advantage, turning search visibility into a steady stream of high-value leads.

# The Rising Demand and Benefits of Tour Operator Marketing UK

While the solo traveler values independence, 2026 has seen a surge in ""hybrid soloing""—traveling independently but joining small-group experiences for specific legs of the journey. This trend has made [**tour operator marketing UK**](https://localpage.uk/blog/category/travel) more critical than ever. Operators are no longer just selling seats on a bus; they are selling ""Wellness Through Community."" Marketing strategies now focus on connecting like-minded individuals, such as ""mid-career micro-retirees"" or ""creative-skill seekers."" By highlighting the human element—the expert local guide or the unique rewilding project—tour operators can differentiate themselves from the automated mass market.The benefits of this focused marketing extend to the regional economy. When a tour operator effectively markets ""non-viral destinations"" like the Coffee Triangle in Colombia or the rural trails of Wales, they help alleviate overtourism in crowded hotspots. This ""regenerative growth"" is a key pillar of the 2026 tourism strategy. Effective marketing ensures that the traveler feels like they are making a positive impact on the world, aligning their holiday with their ethics. For the operator, this translates into a loyal customer base that values substance over hype. In a world of ""global blandness,"" the ability to market authentic, community-focused journeys is what creates a lasting brand legacy.

# How to Enhance User Experience with a Detailed Travel Guide UK

The digital ""user journey"" is as important as the physical one. A well-constructed [**travel guide UK**](https://localpage.uk/blog/category/travel) enhances user experience by providing a seamless, intuitive path from inspiration to execution. In 2026, UX is defined by ""frictionless discovery."" This means guides must be scannable, mobile-optimized, and integrated with real-time data. Whether it's an ""itinerary app"" that adjusts to local weather or a ""trip organizer"" that suggests the best train routes for a solo adventurer, the goal is to reduce the cognitive load on the traveler. When a user can find what they need in seconds, their trust in the provider [increases.To](http://increases.To) truly excel in UX, a guide must also embrace the ""Human Element."" This involves incorporating real reviews, video snapshots of destinations, and interactive elements like ""DIY tasting tours"" or ghost walks. When a solo traveler uses a guide that anticipates their needs—such as identifying quiet spots for ""solo-dining people watching""—they feel understood and supported. This positive association is the bedrock of brand loyalty. By prioritizing the user's peace of mind through a well-designed digital experience, travel brands can turn one-time visitors into lifelong advocates. In essence, the guide becomes a virtual companion that ensures the traveler's journey is as smooth and rewarding as possible.

# Exploring the Lifestyle Benefits Derived from a Solo Travel Guide UK

Solo travel is a profound tool for self-discovery and mental wellbeing. Utilizing a **solo travel guide UK** allows individuals to step away from the pressures of social expectation and rediscover their own rhythm. The lifestyle benefits are numerous: increased confidence, sharpened problem-solving skills, and a deeper sense of self-reliance. In 2026, many are choosing ""Chronocations"" specifically to reset their internal clocks, escaping the caffeine-fueled routine of the modern workplace. By traveling alone, you have the freedom to follow your curiosity without compromise, whether that means spending four hours in a gallery or hiking a coastal path at dawn.Beyond individual growth, solo travel fosters a unique form of social connection. When you travel alone, you are more approachable and more likely to engage with locals or fellow wanderers. This ""social-detox-yet-connected"" lifestyle is increasingly popular among the ""wellbeing"" segment. By following a guide that highlights ""wellness through community""—such as yoga retreats in the Lake District or community-led workshops in Glasgow—solo travelers can find a sense of belonging without the baggage of group dynamics. Ultimately, a life enriched by solo adventures is a life of resilience and expanded horizons, where every trip is a testament to the beauty of independence.

# Infrastructure Development and the Future of British Travel

The UK’s commitment to ""regenerative growth"" is evident in the massive infrastructure projects slated for 2026. From the completion of major phases of the Lower Thames Crossing to the continued roll-out of HS2 preparations, the physical connectivity of the country is being reshaped. These developments are not just about speed; they are about opening up regional Britain to the global market. For the solo traveler, this means easier access to ""under-the-radar"" destinations that were previously difficult to reach. Improved rail links and active travel bridges encourage ""slow travel,"" where the journey itself becomes a central part of the experience.Simultaneously, the digital infrastructure is being upgraded to support the ""AI revolution"" in tourism. VisitEngland and other bodies are prioritizing ""international readiness"" for regional destinations, ensuring that even small towns have the digital footprint to be found by global travelers. This dual-track development—physical and digital—ensures that the UK remains a top-tier destination that is both futuristic and deeply rooted in its heritage. As we move toward the 2030 vision of 50 million visitors, these infrastructure investments will be the backbone of a tourism industry that is more efficient, more sustainable, and more welcoming than ever before.

Hello everyone! Nowadays, everyone is chasing passive income. I've been trying out **Honeygain** for the past few months and thought I'd share an honest ""Reddit-style"" review with you all.

# What is Honeygain?

Basically, it's an app that shares your *unused internet bandwidth*. Large companies use this for web intelligence and market research. You don't have to do anything—just install the app and let it run in the background.

# The Good Stuff (Pros):

* **Zero Effort:** Just run the app and forget about it. It truly is ""Passive"" income.
* **Safe:** It does not access your personal data (photos, messages); it only uses your internet bandwidth.
* **Jumptask Integration:** If you want faster payouts via Crypto, the Jumptask mode is the best option.
* **Content Delivery:** If you're using a PC, you get extra earnings through this feature.

# The Reality Check (Cons):

* **Slow Earning:** This isn't a ""get rich quick"" scheme. It might cover your monthly coffee or snack expenses, but it won't make you wealthy.
* **Battery Consumption:** On mobile devices, it might consume a bit more battery than usual.

# My Tips for Higher Earnings:

1. **Multiple Devices:** Only 1 device is allowed per IP address, but you can connect 2-3 devices if they are on different networks.
2. **Daily Lucky Pot:** Don't forget to open the app daily to claim the ""Lucky Pot""—it gives you free credits.
3. **Referrals:** This is where the real growth is. Invite your friends!

# How to Get Started? (+ $5 Bonus!)

If you sign up using the link below, you'll get a **straight $5 (approx ₹400)** join-in bonus. Without a referral, you have to start from zero, so this is the best shortcut.

👉 **Join Honeygain here:** [https://join.honeygain.com/ANONYF6AF0](https://join.honeygain.com/ANONYF6AF0)

**Final Verdict:** If you have unlimited internet (Wi-Fi), there's no harm in trying it out. Money will keep building up in the background.

After months of scrolling past it, I finally caved and decided to try it myself. Now that I'm three months in, I figured it's time to share my actual experience because honestly, most reviews out there feel super fake or like they're just trying to sell you something.



What Even Is Mitolyn?

Before I get into my experience, let me break down what this stuff actually is. Mitolyn is basically a dietary supplement that's supposed to support your metabolism and mitochondrial function. If you're like me and slept through high school biology, mitochondria are those things we all memorized as ""the powerhouse of the cell."" Turns out they actually do matter when it comes to energy production and how your body processes food.



The whole pitch behind Mitolyn is that it helps optimize these little cellular powerhouses, which theoretically should help with energy levels, weight management, and overall metabolic health. It comes in capsule form, and you're supposed to take it daily with meals.



Why I Actually Decided To Try It

I'm gonna be real with you - I've tried a LOT of supplements over the years. Most of them ended up sitting in my cabinet half-empty because I either didn't notice any difference or they made me feel weird. But I was in this rut where I constantly felt sluggish, especially in the afternoons, and no amount of coffee was helping. I'm in my mid-30s now, and I swear my metabolism just decided to peace out sometime after 32.



I wasn't looking for some miracle weight loss thing or anything like that. I just wanted to feel like myself again - to have enough energy to actually want to go to the gym after work instead of melting into my couch. A friend of mine who's really into health stuff mentioned she'd been taking Mitolyn for a few months and felt like it helped, so I figured why not give it a shot.



First Impressions and Week One

The packaging is pretty straightforward - nothing too fancy, just a regular supplement bottle. Each capsule is a decent size but not so huge that you feel like you're swallowing a horse pill. The instructions say to take two capsules daily with food, preferably in the morning.



I'm not gonna lie, the first week I didn't feel much of anything. I wasn't expecting immediate results, but part of me was still hoping I'd wake up on day two with crazy energy or something. That's not how it works though, and I think that's where a lot of people get disappointed with supplements - they expect overnight transformations.



The only thing I noticed initially was that I didn't get any weird side effects. No jitters, no stomach issues, no headaches. For me, that was actually a good sign because I've had supplements in the past that made me feel anxious or gave me digestive problems.



Weeks 2-4: Starting To Notice Changes

Around the second week, I started noticing something subtle. That 2pm crash I usually experienced wasn't hitting as hard. I work a desk job, and normally by mid-afternoon I'm struggling to keep my eyes open, reaching for my third coffee and contemplating a nap under my desk. But I realized I was getting through my afternoons without that desperate need for caffeine or sugar.



It wasn't like I suddenly had boundless energy or anything dramatic. It was more like... I just felt steadier throughout the day? Like my energy levels weren't doing these crazy peaks and valleys anymore. I was sleeping better too, which I hadn't expected. I fell asleep easier and wasn't waking up multiple times during the night like I usually do.



By week three, I actually wanted to work out. This might not sound like a big deal, but for me it was huge. I'd been paying for a gym membership that I barely used because I was always too tired after work. But I started going to the gym three times a week, and I didn't feel like I was dragging myself there. I actually had the energy to do it.



The Two Month Mark

This is where things got interesting. I wasn't trying to lose weight specifically, but I definitely noticed my clothes fitting better. I lost about 6 pounds without really changing my diet that much - though to be fair, I was working out more consistently, so that probably contributed.



What really stood out to me was my mental clarity. I work in marketing and I'm constantly juggling multiple projects, and I noticed I was getting through my work faster and making fewer stupid mistakes. Brain fog had been such a normal part of my life that I didn't even realize how much it was affecting me until it started lifting.



My morning routine also got easier. I used to hit snooze like five times and stumble around like a zombie for the first hour. Now I was actually waking up when my alarm went off and feeling relatively human right away. Small thing, but it made my mornings so much less stressful.



Month Three: The Current Status

So here I am, 90 days in, and I'm honestly planning to keep taking it. The results have been subtle but consistent. I'm down about 9 pounds total, I have way more energy, and I just feel better overall. My workouts have gotten better too - I can push harder and recover faster.



I also noticed my appetite is more regulated. I used to get these intense hunger pangs and cravings, especially for sugar in the afternoon. Those have pretty much disappeared. I still enjoy food and eat normally, but I'm not getting those desperate ""I need to eat RIGHT NOW"" feelings anymore.



The Not-So-Great Parts

Okay, so it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Here's what I didn't love:



The price - It's definitely not the cheapest supplement out there. I'm spending about $60 per bottle, and each bottle lasts about a month. That's not terrible compared to some supplements, but it adds up.



You have to be consistent - If I forget to take it for a few days, I notice the difference. That afternoon slump comes back, and I feel more sluggish. So you really need to make it part of your daily routine.



Results take time - If you're looking for quick fixes, this isn't it. It took a solid few weeks before I noticed anything, and the benefits built gradually over time.



It's not magic - This might be obvious, but Mitolyn isn't going to fix a terrible diet or make up for no exercise and zero sleep. It's a supplement, which means it's supposed to supplement an already decent lifestyle, not replace healthy habits.



Who I Think Would Actually Benefit

Based on my experience, I think Mitolyn could be helpful if you're:



Dealing with that constant tired feeling even when you're getting enough sleep



In your 30s or beyond and noticing your metabolism isn't what it used to be



Struggling with afternoon energy crashes



Looking to support your overall metabolic health



Willing to give it at least a month or two to see results



I don't think it's necessary if you're already feeling great, have tons of energy, and your metabolism is working fine. Like, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, you know?



My Actual Recommendation

Here's my honest take: Mitolyn worked for me, but that doesn't mean it'll work the same for everyone. Bodies are weird and everyone responds differently to supplements. What I can say is that it's been worth the money for me personally, and I'm going to keep taking it.



If you're on the fence, I'd suggest trying it for at least two months. One month might not be enough to really see the benefits since they build gradually. And obviously, if you have any health conditions or take other medications, talk to your doctor first. I'm just some random person on Reddit, not a medical professional.



The biggest thing for me was managing my expectations. I wasn't looking for dramatic weight loss or some total life transformation. I just wanted to feel better and have more energy, and on that front, it delivered. The weight loss and improved fitness were nice bonuses.



Final Thoughts

Look, I get being skeptical about supplements. Most of them are overhyped garbage that doesn't do anything except make your pee expensive. But Mitolyn has been one of the few that actually made a noticeable difference for me. It's not going to change your life overnight, but if you're struggling with low energy and metabolic issues like I was, it might be worth a shot.



Would I recommend it? Yeah, cautiously. Try it for a couple months, pay attention to how you feel, and see if it works for you. Keep your receipt in case it doesn't. And seriously, don't expect miracles - expect gradual improvements that build over time.",1,1771061964.0,pppdizziness,0,1.0,False

This is because it is very convenient, affordable and accessible for just about anyone as depending on where you can get coffee for around 13k VND at a street vendor which is around 76 yen or even at more established cafes you can get it for 30k to 60k which is around 176-352 yen.

I'm wondering how much this applies to the average person in Japan. I am originally from the UK and would almost always drink store bought instant coffee that I would have at home. Getting a coffee from a cafe would only be a social activity with friends.

There is a saying that whenever you see some funny robotics video of a robot jumping over things or some insane imaging software which can refine an image that it's secretly just a test for surveillance and policing technology. Already police forces have rolled out more and more drone use for police officers, citing the ability to quickly survey areas and record footage. A drone can survey an area looking for a suspect, missing person or evidence much faster than officers or a helicopter can be organised. The main concern by civil rights groups is the legality of it, when can a drone enter someone's property? When can police continually surveil someone with a drone rather than other methods? A recent court case made it so that German police can use drones to enter property when law would otherwise authorise a police officer to enter the property.



**Farming**



The proliferation of drones in agriculture has seen a marked shift in how farm work is carried out, while the work remains the same the jobs that drones can perform has increased. The spraying of pesticides, seeds and fertilisers, mapping and observation and various mundane farm work can now be replaced by drones. This technology isn't even that recent, China and other big farming nations have revolutionised drone usage in farms and Germany is really just catching up. Recently domestic suppliers and the import of foreign models has seen drone usage soar.



**Warehouses**



Warehouse robotics is perhaps the easiest place to roboticise, a known location, with known weights and locations and very simple instructions (take item and put it somewhere). It's no surprise that warehouse robots, much like drones in farming, have been proliferating as their cost goes down and their reliability and efficiency goes up. Already some warehouses are practically fully autonomous with humans for management, error catching and for oversight. Companies in Germany have their eyes set on scale, not just robots in warehouses but in entire ports and industrial areas. From Ship to Warehouse to truck to supermarket the companies want to have a robot at every step in place of a human.



**Medicine**

Robotics has mainly seen advancements in the domestic production and development of robotic surgery devices, machines that promise to allow for a surgeon to control robotic arms that can move better and safer than human hands. For legal reasons more autonomous robotics are out of the question, many lawyers would have a stroke if they heard someone was undergoing surgery without a surgeon at the controls. But the idea has wormed its way into the engineers heads, replacing highly paid surgeons with a robot that has the mechanics and the brains to perform surgery would save an immense amount of money and make healthcare much cheaper. The obvious issue is one of training, when a robot makes a mistake you would want it to drop a coffee cup not sever an artery.

I spent the last week exploring London as a tourist and I totally loved it. As a hopeless romantic woman in my 20s I was most excited to explore Notting Hill.

I don’t know what we were expecting. Maybe a more authentic feel? But the markets and shops just felt overly curated and targeted for tourists. Astronomical prices too; we didn’t buy a thing. The coffee shops and food were better and I’d maybe go back for pastries and other sweet treats but that’s about it. The colourful streets were nice of course, but I guess that’s just a photo opportunity more than an experience to be had.      

Is there a better place in London for vintage shopping? Are there places to go and things to do in Notting Hill that maybe we missed?

One is halfway through a migration, another just finished a component, the third is waiting for me to review a 30-file changeset.

And I can't stop.

Not because I'm stuck. Because the output never stops. Every few minutes there's something new to review, test, approve, or redirect. The agent finishes something, I review it, give feedback, it iterates, I review again. It's a feedback loop with no natural stopping point.

When I was coding manually, the slowness was built-in. You'd spend 3 hours on a single feature. You'd hit a wall, go make coffee, come back. The code waited for you. Now the code doesn't wait. And there's this pressure - partly self-imposed, partly the subscription - to keep responding. Every idle minute feels like wasted tokens.

I catch myself at 2am not because I'm debugging something, but because an agent just finished and I ""might as well"" review it before bed. Then the review leads to another iteration. Then another.

The thing nobody told me: shipping 10x faster doesn't mean you work 10x less. It means you make 10x more decisions per day. And decisions are what actually drain you, not typing code.

The below pasted code is a generic version of my use case but an LLM should be able to modify it for yours if you're not confident with that stuff (I'm not either!)

After a lot of trial and error, I found a reliable way to turn it into a 24/7 interactive kiosk that acts as a digital photo frame (screensaver) with a ""Heads Up Display"" for my calendar, while revealing smart home controls when touched.

I won't go into how to set up Home Assistant as there are likely a million other guides on how to get it set up.

# The Logic

We are fighting two battles:

1. **Keep it Awake:** The Portal will sleep if it detects inactivity. We defeat this by playing an invisible, silent YouTube video in the background 24/7.
2. **Layering:** We use **WallPanel** as the top layer (photos/clock/calendar) which ""hides"" itself on touch to reveal the standard HA dashboard underneath.

# Prerequisites

* **Hardware:** Meta Portal Plus (or any Android-based kiosk).
* **Software:** Home Assistant.
* **HACS Integrations Needed:**
   * `WallPanel` (handles the screensaver/photos).
   * `YouTube Video Card` (handles the keep-alive heartbeat).
   * `Atomic Calendar Revive` (for the ""Today"" agenda overlay).
   * `Digital Clock` (optional top-right clock).

# Step 1: The ""Keep Alive"" Heartbeat

The most critical part. If you just open a dashboard, the Portal will sleep after 15 minutes. **The Fix:** We embed a `custom:youtube-video-card` that is 1 pixel wide and invisible. **The Trick:** Instead of a short looping video (which mobile browsers often block from auto-replaying), use a **7-Day (168 Hour) Timer Video**. This ensures the browser stays active for a full week without needing a refresh.

* **Video ID:** `gSvU-flG6FY` (168 Hour Timer)

# Step 2: The Interactive ""Screensaver""

We configure **WallPanel** to act as the primary view. It cycles through photos from a local media folder.

* **Interaction:** When I tap the screen, WallPanel fades out for 10 seconds, letting me use the light switches/sliders underneath.
* **HUD Overlay:** I added a transparent **Digital Clock** (top right) and a **Calendar Agenda** (bottom center) that sit *on top* of the photos. This lets me see the time and my daily schedule (Family events + Bin collections) without touching the screen.

# Step 3: The Code (Copy/Paste)

Here is the full dashboard configuration. You can paste this into your Dashboard's ""Raw Configuration Editor"" to get the exact setup.

  
```yaml
wallpanel:
  enabled: true
  hide_toolbar: true
  hide_sidebar: true
  fullscreen: true

1r4gbh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyDoseCoolFinds/comments/1r4gbh7/tired_of_inflated_deals_heres_my_actual_process/,"Tired of inflated ""deals""? Here's my actual process for finding genuine savings by tracking price history and reading honest reviews 🔍 (Saved $250 on home goods this quarter by avoiding impulse buys)","Anyone else totally fed up with those ""flash sales"" that conveniently reset the MSRP just before the discount, making it look like a huge saving when it's barely a few bucks off? I've been tracking prices for years, especially on everyday tech and home goods, and honestly, most ""deals"" are just marketing noise. It feels like you need a data science degree just to figure out if you're actually saving money or just falling for clever pricing tricks.

But here's the thing: real deals *do* exist, you just have to know where to look and have a little patience. I've been putting in the legwork to find genuine value, and it's actually pretty rewarding when you snag something truly worthwhile.

Here's what I've found lately, looking beyond the flashy ads:

*   **Noise-Cancelling Headphones:** I saw a popular mid-tier brand advertised at '$149.99, down from $250!' on a big retail site. A quick check of its price history showed it regularly sells for $160-170. *However*, after tracking it for another week, it genuinely dropped to **$119.99** on Amazon for about 36 hours. That's a real **~25% off its typical street price**, not the advertised 50% from an inflated MSRP. Took about 10 minutes of research total over a week.
*   **Coffee Scale with Timer:** Needed one for pour-over. Most decent ones hover around $30-40. Found one on a niche kitchen gadget site for $38, but a specific discount code (shared by a small YouTube reviewer, not a major influencer) brought it down to **$26.60**. That's a solid **30% off** and exactly what I was looking for. No shipping fees because I met a minimum order.
*   **Smart Plugs (4-pack):** Regularly see reliable smart plugs for $25-30. One brand I like (good app, reliable integration) went on 'sale' for $22. But by setting a price alert, I grabbed a pack for **$16.99** during a lightning deal that lasted less than 4 hours. That's **~25% less** than its average low price, and a quick setup for some home automation.

Now, let's be real. This isn't 'set it and forget it' stuff. You won't find these deals just by clicking the first ad you see. It takes a bit of patience, some historical price checking (tools like Keepa or CamelCamelCamel are your friends), and sometimes digging into smaller retailers or watching for specific coupon codes from less-mainstream sources. Shipping can sometimes be slower from those sellers, and stock for these genuinely good drops can vanish fast. Also, region matters—what I find in my area might not be available for everyone.

If you're tired of sifting through endless 'deals' that aren't actually deals, and you want to see what's *actually* worth your money after some digging and comparing, then consider following r/DailyDoseCoolFinds. We're building a community dedicated to real findings—we test products, compare actual prices, look at price history, and share what's genuinely good, not just what's advertised.

I chose my clothes with care,

not to impress,

but to honour the body

that has carried me

through every leaving and return.

I walked into town

with no one beside me

and no emptiness either.

but my hands were warm

in my own pockets.

I took myself to lunch.

Ordered what I truly wanted.

Tasted each bite without rushing.

Listened to my thoughts

as if they were a dear friend

finally being heard.

Later, I wandered through quiet streets,

pausing at shop windows,

smiling at strangers,

feeling whole in a way

that does not depend

on being chosen.

Love is not only

a pair of hands reaching for yours.

Sometimes it is the courage

to sit alone at a table

and feel complete.

Tonight I will light a candle

and speak gently to myself.

I will say thank you

for surviving,

for hoping,

for trying again.

I am loving.

I’m sat here watching my 11yo daughter drop the tv remote on the floor because she misjudged the distance to the coffee table once again. This is after she’s dropped a butter knife twice at breakfast.

Dropping things occasionally wouldn’t be a cause for concern, but it’s all the damn time. Every meal we have, something gets dropped or spilt. She’s never had great control of her arms and legs and would frequently smack me in the face by accident. We always thought it’s because she’s a little on the tall side and maybe her brain hadn’t caught up with her body, but she seems to have no spacial awareness.

She also has no concept of time. Every morning is a rush. She leaves her homework until the last minute and then freaks out when it’s 9:30pm and she’s still got an hour to do, despite me constantly encouraging her to do it.

She’s pretty good on the hygiene side and showers every day, but even that was a battle. She doesn’t seem to notice or care when her deodorant has failed. She never ever ties her shoe laces (she can, she just doesn’t) and has no problem with wearing her clothes inside out or the wrong way around.

She is exceptionally messy. I can’t stress how messy her room gets in the course of a week. She’s not particularly sporty either and has never been good at catching. She tends to put her hands in front of her face than out to catch. Her handwriting has always been messy. Her dad and I have raised it with teachers every year since she started school and only recently has it got to the point of decent legibility. To be fair, she’s a leftie and as a leftie myself, I know it presents challenges with neatness. But this is like super rushed and squished.

She’s a very intelligent girl and achieving above expectation in every academic subject (apart from PE - lol), so she absolutely not behind in that sense. She’s been selected to do additional science workshops at exclusive schools for example.

She has terrible mood swings. Maybe this is just being a tween? Idk. She was an early developer and got her period at 10, and is already 5’1”, so I know she’s a little ahead of the curve in that respect. I’m a single parent with full custody so don’t have her dad to bounce off, so I’m considering getting her assessed because it’s got past the point of cuteness now and I’m genuinely getting worried for her.

I'm not super creative but I remembered she mentioned once that she loved scavenger hunts as a kid.

So I spent the last week planning a scavenger hunt around our city. Each clue led to a place that was meaningful to us - the coffee shop where we had our first date, the park bench where we had our first kiss, the bookstore where we spent 3 hours talking on our third date.

At each location, I left a small envelope with a clue to the next spot plus a little note about why that place mattered to me. The final location was the pier where we watched the sunset on one of our early dates, and I had a picnic setup waiting.

She absolutely loved it. She said it was the most thoughtful thing anyone had ever done for her. What really hit her was that I remembered all these little moments and places that she didn't think I'd paid attention to.

The whole thing cost me maybe $40 (mostly the picnic food) and took a few hours to plan, but it felt way more personal than an expensive restaurant. She kept all the notes and said she's going to frame them.

If you're looking for a creative date idea that doesn't break the bank but shows real effort, I can't recommend this enough. Just make sure you think through the logistics - I did a trial run to make sure the timing worked and all the spots were accessible.

He really hoped the slipper wouldn't be seen. After all, a man carrying a luxury slipper in his bag would look strange to anyone, and he didn't want anyone to think he was a thief; the very thought disgusted him. So he decided to hide the bag in the space between himself and the wall.

""Want to order?""

""Huh?!""

He jumped, taken aback by the voice. He quickly turned in the direction it came from and instantly calmed down when he realized it was a regular waitress.

""Oh, yes, I'll have a coffee, please,"" she said, scratching her head nervously.

The noise of those watching the game had prevented him from hearing her approach.

""I noticed you really like our coffee shop; it's already the fourth time you've been here this month.""

Ugh. He hated talking to people. He wasn't good with words at all; he preferred other ways of interacting.

""Ahaha, yes, I love the coffee here,"" he replied, hoping his laugh sounded convincing.

""I'm glad you like it so much."" With that, the waitress left.

While waiting for his coffee, he observed the other customers, as was his habit. He enjoyed watching how people interacted with the environment.

At the back of the café, he saw a lonely father playing with his daughter.
On the other end, a young couple: he couldn't hear what they were saying, but from their constant chatter, he guessed they were engaged.

Right in front of the entrance was a large television, probably eighty-five inches, which attracted a flock of customers, like bread attracts pigeons to a square. Their applause and complaints reverberated throughout the place, making it almost difficult to think.

He didn't know the teams playing. He had never been interested in soccer, and more generally, he had never been interested in the things that attracted most people. Having children, getting engaged, making friends: things that seemed impossible to him. He felt utterly incapable of creating any kind of connection.

He didn't hate people; on the contrary, he had always felt a strong love for others. But he had never been able to express it in ways others could understand. He'd always felt a huge gap between himself and the rest of the world.

He'd tried different sports, joined clubs, participated in communities, but he'd never felt truly connected. And even when he pretended otherwise, others always managed to notice, preventing him from forming a true bond.

That was precisely why he hated thieves: petty beings who went around stealing and breaking other people's bonds, unaware of how important they could be. He knew they were just objects, but it was still sad to see something you loved disappear.

He didn't have a mirror in front of him, but he imagined that from the outside he must have looked like a corpse.

He should stop moping so much. He couldn't wait for the moment to come.
As if hearing his request, the waitress returned with the coffee. This time, having noticed her early, he managed to grab the drink without being caught off guard. After thanking her, she left.

He felt a wave of heat pass through him from the hand holding the cup. It wasn't the cup that was particularly warm: it was he who had always been cold. He couldn't remember a single time when her touch had been warmer than anyone else's.

Yet that warmth reminded him that he, too, had found a way to connect with others.

A work that always united everyone's hearts, regardless of their differences.

Her work would soon be broadcast on TV. She was waiting for that very moment to start drinking her coffee. Not that she really wanted to drink it: just from the almost nonexistent smell, she knew it would have no flavor. After all, she had only come here because there were so many people.
She continued to hold the cup, hoping it wouldn't cool too quickly.

Suddenly, she heard a chorus of ""no""s coming from the television. She couldn't help but smile, knowing what it meant.

The soccer game had been interrupted by a special news broadcast.

There was talk of a murder. Already on the fourth of that month. The victim was Barbara Armani, an elderly local millionaire. Her entire family had died of old age before her; she had never married. She had been found on the couch, her throat slit. What left her most suspicious was the almost total absence of signs of theft: nothing was missing from the house. The only thing missing was one of the woman's two slippers.

The reporter continued talking, but had already turned his attention to the customers.

The father, apparently single, was covering his daughter's ears, a worried expression on his face.

The couple was arguing about who the killer might be.

The men in front of the television were wondering why the killer was always stealing the slippers.

As he listened to them, he noticed that his coffee, normally bitter, was starting to sweeten. Because in that one moment of the week, his heart felt connected to others.

He imagined it was the same feeling an artist feels when he observes the crowd's reaction to his work.",1,1771059439.0,writers,1,1.0,False
1r4ftp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SabbaticalPlanning/comments/1r4ftp2/the_best_part_of_my_sabbatical_wasnt_the_bucket/,The best part of my sabbatical wasn't the bucket list trips - it was actually the 9am bootcamp and coffee just down the road!,"I’ve just (Jan 26) returned to work after a 6-month sabbatical and I’m still reflecting pretty hard on everything I experienced and learned during my time away. I wanted to share my little story in case it's helpful! 

**My Sabbatical Plan - Travel, Travel, Travel : )**

The main impetus for the sabbatical was an extended wedding and honeymoon celebration. The plan was to get married in Thailand, have a short trip in Cambodia with family, then honeymoon in Hawaii for three glorious week (spending too much money on honeymoon style hotels). After that I’d spend some time in the UK, then do an extended trip to Nepal to hike the Manaslu Circuit and the Everest High Passes and Peaks. The end of the sabbatical was New Zealand. Nepal and New Zealand have both been very high on my bucket list - proper “once in a lifetime” trips.

**What Went Well** 

I was quite meticulous with the financial planning for the trip and this took a lot of stress out of day-to-day life during the time off. I’d budgeted carefully and built in buffers, so money wasn’t a background anxiety. I paced the travel pretty well too throughout the 6 months so I never got bored of where I was at the time. I think there was generally a good rhythm of movement and pause.

Another thing that really helped was getting proper buy-in and support from work before I left. I was transparent early, gave a lot of notice (I asked for the sabbatical a full year early), and made sure handovers were thorough. Because of that, I never felt stressed about “what was happening back there” while I was away. There was no lingering guilt, no constant checking in, no fear that I was damaging my reputation. That psychological safety made a massive difference. It allowed me to actually switch off rather than half-sabbatical, half-remote employee in my head.

Hawaii and New Zealand were once in a lifetime trips. But the prices of EVERYTHING in Hawaii were out of control. I've never spent so much money on such aggressively average stuff in my life...It was beautiful, but the sting of feeling ripped off every time you had a meal or checked out of a hotel and are hit with ""resort tax"" diminished the fun.  New Zealand on the other hand was magnificent. I'm a huge lover of the outdoors, and it just delivered in every possible way. Big landscapes, proper hiking, super friendly people and great coffee everywhere! The feeling of space and rawness was mind expanding. It was just so was special.

**What Didn't Go Well...& the Surprises** 

In the end I had to abandon the Nepal leg as my husband had a family emergency (he was joining for that part). That was hard - emotionally and practically, especially as Nepal was such a bucket list destination for me and I'd already bought all the hiking gear by the time I cancelled it. 

The biggest surprise for me was that, without really realising it, I was totally burnt out from work. I’d normalised a constant low-level stress for so long that I didn’t even see it anymore. The removal of the structure of work did impact me - even though I had fantasised about the sabbatical for SO long! I had somehow managed to make my world feel quite small (and I guess, ""safe""). So suddenly having this expansive period of time in front of me and the internal pressure to make the **absolute** most of it actually had a negative effect at first.

If you are like me and don’t exactly “love” your job, I think you can end up blaming it for everything wrong in your life. However, when you take the job away and you’re still left with problems, you come to a bit of a realisation that it’s probably actually just you. One the one hand that realisation hit me hard, but on the other hand it also means its fixable with some self work.

As I mentioned above, I had to cancel the Nepal leg of the itinerary. This left me with a 5-week unexpected gap in the middle of the sabbatical. Initially I was racing to fill the time with yet more travel, but nothing was really speaking to me. In the end I went on a short trip to Japan and Thailand, then came home. I told myself I’d go away again if I felt the urge but otherwise I’d just take some time to relax and see what happened.

That decision was probably the best one I made during the whole experience. I knew I needed some structure, so I joined a bootcamp near home and went religiously 5 days a week at 9am. I’d then have a great coffee nearby, sit and watch the world go by, and started planning a small side podcast project I’d been thinking about for years. All of that together grounded me in ways I never expected. 

Enjoying the slowness and genuinely “un-optimised” time was a revelation. Since adulthood, I don’t remember another period where I just *was* without chasing the next milestone, promotion, or trip. Ever since university it's just been this never ending, goalpost moving grind. So this period of reflection and slowness was just exactly what I needed! 

**My Advice**

My advice to anyone planning a sabbatical is to:

* Leave work in a good place, don't burn bridges. Be as helpful as you can to those taking over your work whilst you're away and give them support. Future you will thank you for it when you go back to work. 
* Dial in the finances so you don't need to worry about that. Be disciplined and stick to your budget - the last thing you want to do is to come up short and taint the experience with money stress! 
* Deliberately leave some gaps. Let life catch up with you. Let yourself slow down. Learning how to do that is a bit of a skill in itself!
* If you can make it to New Zealand, do it!!
* Accept that the sabbatical won’t “fix” you. It’s not a magic reset button. You take yourself with you. The time away will/might reveal things about yourself. Hopefully some brilliant, but if also maybe some uncomfortable. But that’s kinda the point.
* Have at least one grounding routine wherever you are - it doesn't have to be anything epic. For me it was the 9am bootcamp and a coffee afterwards. Something small and repeatable can stop the whole thing feeling wobbly.
* Finally, and I can't stress this enough, don’t over-optimise it. You don’t need every day to be profound or productive or bucket-list worthy. Some of the most valuable parts (for me anyway) were the most ordinary.

**What's Next?**

So as I mentioned at the start, I've gone back to work. I'm still adjusting to the urgency, pace and drudgery of corporate life again. I'm trying hard to maintain the things that grounded me during the sabbatical and take them into my new ""Work 2.0"" mode. I'm also genuinely questioning what comes next - reducing the number of days to work a week, starting my own ""something"", anything but slipping back to the stressed filled singular identity of *only* work. 

The sabbatical was the best thing I've done for myself in a decade. I loved it, it surprised me and I learned a lot about myself. I wish I'd managed to get a year off instead of ""just"" 6 months ; )

The house across the field.,"You ever have a memory you wish ya could just burn out of ya skull? One of those memories that make you sick to ya stomach? one that feels like a dream you can't wake from?

I wish it was a dream. 

I wish I could go back to that weekend when the only thing I was worried about was Rico’s cheap damn combos in Street Fighter.





But the air in Detroit is heavy with things that aren't supposed to be there. This is how it started for me. This is what I want to forget.

You know that feeling when you’re being watched, but the person watching you is a mile away? That was Faircrest at dusk.

I was sitting on the floor of my friend Rico’s living room. The SNES was humming, the TV screen throwing jagged blue and purple light over the walls. Rico was leaning so far forward he was practically inside the tube, his tongue poking out the corner of his mouth.

""You better not hit that cheap move again, Rico,"" I warned, my thumbs aching from gripping the controller too hard.

""You just mad 'cause you losing, Ant,"" he shot back, a wicked grin splitting his face.

""I ain't losing. The controller’s sticking.""

""You finna lose,"" he cackled.





On the screen, Blanka let out a digitized screech and electrocuted my character into a pile of pixels. I groaned, dropping the controller against my chest. ""Man, that character is broken.""

Rico didn't even look up. ""Life’s broken, man. Adapt.""

Behind us, Rico’s older sister, Rochelle, was sprawled across the couch. She had a textbook open, but she’d been staring at the same page for twenty minutes. She kicked Rico’s shoulder with a socked foot. ""You two sound like you’re arguing over rent money. Keep it down before Ma hears you.""

""If it was real money, I’d be a millionaire,"" I joked, though my heart wasn't really in it.

I looked toward the window. Outside, the sun was sinking, smearing a bruised orange light across the abandoned field next door. During the day, it was just a dump—broken 40oz bottles, waist-high weeds, and the empty patches of dirt where the city had ripped out three houses years ago.

But at night? At night, that field looked wider. It looked like it was stretching.





The house was sitting right there on the edge of the property line. The one the city missed. It was a rotting, three-story Victorian that leaned to the left, like it was trying to whisper something to the house next to it. No one lived there. No one even tagged it with graffiti. Even the crackheads stayed clear.

""Yo, Ant,"" Rico said, snapping me out of it. ""You staying the whole weekend, right?""

""Yeah,"" I said, pulling my eyes away from the dark window. ""My mom said it’s cool. She said Rochelle is scarier than most dudes anyway, so if ya mom does have to leave for something I’d be safe."" 

Rochelle smirked, her eyes still on her book. ""Accurate.""

I've known Rico and Rochelle, for what felt like forever, we went to the same school, our moms were even friends and they both have the same name ""Michelle.""

The mood was perfect. Simple. The rattle of the box fan, the smell of fried chicken from down the block, and the low-frequency hum of the city. Then, the knock came.

It wasn't a normal knock. It was hard, rhythmic, and confident. Like whoever was out there was already stepping inside in their mind.

Rochelle sighed, moving to the door. ""Watch. It's the whole circus.""

She was right. Kim burst in first, loud and bright, followed by Tyson—who was already heading for the kitchen to see what was in the fridge—and finally Tasha. Tasha was the one who made me uneasy. She didn't walk into a room; she drifted. She stayed near the door, her eyes flicking to the corners of the ceiling before she looked at any of us.

""Why y'all house always smell like food?"" Kim asked, plopping down next to me and making the couch protest.

""Because we eat, Kim. Try it sometime,"" Rochelle said, closing her book.





The room filled with the kind of noise that usually makes you feel safe. Jokes, insults, the sound of Tyson raiding the sausage from the stove. But every time the streetlight outside flickered, the shadows in the hallway seemed to jump just a little too far.

""Anybody wanna hear something creepy?"" Kim asked, her voice dropping an octave.

Rico rolled his eyes. ""Man, y'all always on that ghost stuff.""

Tyson walked back in, chewing on a piece of sausage link. He leaned against the doorframe, his shadow stretching halfway across the floor. ""Depends. You want the fake stuff, or the stuff that actually happens on this block?""

I looked at the window again. The abandoned house across the field seemed closer now. Like it had moved a few inches while we weren't looking.

""What's real creepy, Tyson?"" I asked.

Tyson didn't smile. He just stared at the dark glass of the window. ""You ever hear of the Pig-Lady?""

The fan clicked. The TV buzzed. And for the first time that night, the house felt very, very cold.

Tyson let the silence sit there, heavy and suffocating, until the only sound was the rhythmic clack-clack-clack of the box fan.

""The Pig-Lady,"" he finally repeated, his voice barely a whisper. ""Folks say she lived in the slaughterhouse district back in the '40s. Something went wrong—a fire, or maybe something she did to herself. Now, she don't have a face. Not a human one, anyway.""





Rico let out a jagged, nervous laugh. ""Man, that’s just some urban legend to keep us off the property.""

""Is it?"" Tasha spoke up from her corner. She hadn't moved since she entered. Her eyes were fixed on the reflection in the darkened TV screen. ""My grandma says the ground under that field is sour. She says when the city tore those houses down, they did it because the houses were... screaming.""

""Alright, enough,"" Rochelle snapped, though I noticed her fingers were white where she gripped the edge of her textbook. ""It's Friday night. We aren't doing this.""

But the seed was planted. I could feel a low-level hum in the back of my skull. Every time I looked at the window, the reflection of the living room felt wrong. It was like the room in the glass was a second late catching up to our movements.

""I bet y'all wouldn't even walk to the porch,"" Kim teased, her eyes gleaming with that reckless energy she always had. ""me and Rico gave each other that look, like we about to run just talking about it.""

""I ain't scared of no old house,"" Rico barked, though he didn't move.

""Prove it,"" Kim challenged. ""Truth or Dare. And I already know what the dare is.""

""Truth or Dare?"" Rochelle laughed, but it was a dry, humorless sound. She slammed her textbook shut, the dust motes dancing in the lamplight. 

""Absolutely not. 





Every time we play that, someone ends up crying, or the cops end up at the door because Kim dared someone to throw eggs at a patrol car. We’re staying inside. We’re being civilized.""

""Civilized is boring, Ro,"" Tyson groaned, his massive frame shifting in the recliner. He’d finished the sausages and was now eyeing a bowl of stale chips.

""Besides, Ant is staying the whole weekend. Rico just told us. You really gonna make us leave him here to just play Street Fighter until his thumbs bleed?""

""Wait, Ant’s staying?"" Kim’s eyes lit up with a predatory sort of glee. She turned to me. ""And you didn't say nothing? Man, if I gotta go back to my house and listen to my auntie argue with the cable company all night, I’m gonna lose it.""

""Can we stay?"" Tasha asked quietly. It was the most she’d spoken all night. She was still tucked into the corner near the hallway, her fingers nervously twisting a loose thread on her hoodie. ""My house feels… loud tonight. I don't want to be there.""

Rico looked at Rochelle. Rochelle looked at the ceiling, praying for patience.

""Please?"" Kim begged, pouting with exaggerated drama like usual. ""We’ll be good. We’ll even help with the dishes. Maybe.""

""Ma’s gonna kill us,"" Rico muttered, though I could see he wanted the company. 

The house felt too big with just the three of us when the sun went down.

""She’s about to head out for her shift,"" Rochelle said, checking her watch. ""If she says yes, you stay. If she says no, you’re out the door the second her car pulls out the driveway. Understood?""

A chorus of ""bet"" and ""thank you"" erupted. 





A few minutes later, Michelle—Rico and Rochelle’s mom came down the hall in her nurse’s scrubs, smelling like peppermint and industrial soap. 

She was tired, the dark circles under her eyes deep enough to hold shadows, but she had that soft, ""Mom"" heart.

""Fine,"" she sighed, pointing a finger at Tyson. ""But if I come home and my fridge is empty, Tyson, you’re paying me back in manual labor. And Rochelle is in charge. I mean it. No wandering, no trouble.""

""Yes, ma'am,"" the of three them said in a practiced, perfect unison.

We watched from the window as her taillights faded into the Detroit haze. 

The second the sound of her engine vanished, the atmosphere shifted. The ""grown-up"" air left the room, replaced by a jittery, electric tension.

""Alright,"" Kim said, dropping onto the floor and crossing her legs. ""Since Rochelle is a fun-killer and won't let us play Truth or Dare yet… let's talk about why we’re actually staying. Let's talk about the stuff people don't say out loud.""

""You mean...ghost stories?"" I asked, trying to sound braver than I felt.

""Real ones,"" Tyson said.

We went around the circle. Kim told a story about some ""Hitchhiker of 8-Mile"" that felt like something she’d read on a forum. 

Rico told a story about a haunted barber shop on the West Side that made us laugh more than scream. 





But then Tasha spoke.

""My grandma,"" she started, her voice so low we had to lean in, ""she says that before the city tore those three houses down across the field, there was someone who lived in the middle one. 

They kept animals in the basement. Not for food. For company. She said that they started sounding like those animals. Grunting. Squealing. 

One night, the neighbors heard a scream that sounded like a person being put through a meat grinder. When the police came… the person who lived there was gone. But the animals were fat. Real fat. And they had human hair stuck in their teeth.""

Silence fell over the room. The box fan clicked. Clack. Clack. Clack.

""That’s just a story, Tasha,"" Rico said, his voice cracking slightly.

""Then why did the city tear the houses down?"" Tasha asked. ""Nothing grows there, Rico. Not even the weeds look right.""





""Man, whatever,"" Tyson said, clapping his hands together to break the spell. ""I’m bored of talking. Let’s do it. Truth or Dare. Right now. Simple stuff first to get the blood flowing.""

We started easy. Rico had to call his crush and hang up (he turned bright red). 

Kim had to do a handstand against the door for thirty seconds. 

Tyson had to eat a spoonful of hot sauce and mustard. We were laughing, the dread from Tasha’s story beginning to recede.

Then Kim turned to me and Rico. Her smile wasn't friendly anymore. It was sharp.

""Ant. Rico,"" she said. ""I dare you both to go out there. Walk across the field. Stand on the porch of the House. Count to ten. Then come back.""

My stomach did a slow, cold roll. I looked at Rico. He looked like he wanted to vanish into the floorboards.

""The House?"" I whispered.

""The House,"" Kim reaffirmed. ""Unless you're both just talk.""

The room went quiet again. The flickering streetlight outside cast a long, skeletal shadow of the window frame across the floor, pointing straight toward the field.

""Fine,"" I said, my voice sounding like it belonged to someone else. ""We'll do it.""





The air outside the front door was different from the air inside. 

Inside, it was heavy with the smell of Rico's house—old carpet, Pine-Sol, and the lingering scent of fried sausage. 

Outside, the night felt hollow. It was that weird, dead silence you only get in the city when the wind dies down and the streetlights hum just a little too loud.

""We don't have to do this, Ant,"" Rico whispered as we stepped onto the sidewalk. His voice was thin, like paper tearing.

""And let Kim hold this over us for the rest of the year? Nah,"" I said, though my legs felt like they were made of lead. 

""Ten seconds, Rico. We count fast, we run back. Easy.""

We stepped off the concrete and into the field.

The grass wasn't just overgrown; it was thick and oily, dragging against our shins. Every step felt like the ground was trying to hold onto us. 

As we approached the House, the light from the streetlamps seemed to fail. 

It didn't just get darker; the light seemed to be repelled by the structure, curving around it like water around a stone.

The House loomed. Up close, the rotting Victorian looked less like a building and more like a carcass. The wood was grey and peeling, like dead skin. 

We reached the porch. The steps groaned under our weight—a deep, wet sound, like a bone snapping in slow motion.

""One,"" I whispered. ""Two,"" Rico countered, his eyes darting toward the black void of the front window. ""Three. Four...""

At ""five,"" the sound started. 

It came from right behind the front door. It wasn't a knock. It was a rhythmic, wet thud-thud-thud, like something heavy and fleshy was being swung against the wood from the inside. Then, a long, rattling breath—congested, bubbling with fluid—followed by a sharp, guttural sound.





Rico didn't even wait for ""six."" 

He spun around and bolted. I was right on his heels, my heart hammering so hard it felt like it was going to burst through my ribs. 

We scrambled back across the field, the weeds hissing against our clothes, until we burst through Rico’s front door and slammed it shut, sliding the deadbolt home with a frantic click.

""Whoa, whoa!"" Tyson laughed, jumping back from the door. ""Y'all look like you saw the devil himself.""

""Something was in there,"" Rico gasped, doubled over with his hands on his knees, his face the color of ash. ""Something big. It hit the door. It... it sounded like an animal.""

Kim crossed her arms, a skeptical smirk on her face. ""Man, please. It was probably a stray dog or a squatter. You didn't even stay for the full ten seconds. I was watching through the window. You hit that porch and turned tail in five.""

""It wasn't a dog, Kim!"" I snapped, my hands still shaking. ""I'm telling you, it was right there. Right behind the wood.""

""You guys didn't do the dare right,"" Kim insisted, shaking her head. ""A dare is a dare. If you don't finish it, it doesn't count. You’re officially the biggest scrubs.""

""Scrubs?"" Rico bristled, his fear suddenly turning into defensive anger. ""We went out there! I didn't see you moving toward the door! You're sitting here acting tough behind a locked deadbolt. You’re the chicken, Kim. You and Tyson and Tasha.""

""I ain't no chicken,"" Tyson growled, standing up. ""I'll go right now.""





""Then let's go,"" I challenged, the adrenaline making me reckless. 

""Since you’re so brave, Tyson. Let’s all go. If it’s just a squatter, then six of us can handle it.""

""No,"" Rochelle said firmly, standing up from the couch. ""Nobody is going back out there. Ma said stay inside.""

""Oh, come on, Ro,"" Kim teased. ""You scared too? The big bad babysitter is afraid of an empty house?""

""I'm not afraid,"" Rochelle narrowed her eyes. ""I'm being smart.""

""You're being a scrub,"" Rico chimed in, emboldened by my side. ""A total scrub. Just admit you're terrified of a pile of old wood.""

The bickering went on for ten minutes—the kind of circular, ego-driven arguing that only happens when you trying to prove you aren't the weakest link. Eventually, the pressure shifted. The room felt smaller, the air tighter. 

Maybe it was the peer pressure, or maybe it was something pulling at us, but the decision was made.

""Fine,"" Rochelle snapped, grabbing her heavy flashlight from the kitchen drawer. ""Three minutes. We go in, we stand in the foyer, we come back. That’s it. Then we lock the door for the rest of the weekend and I don't want to hear another word about that house.""





We walked out as a group this time. The six of us, shoulder to shoulder.

As we crossed the field, the temperature dropped. Not a breeze, just a sudden, bone-deep chill. Tasha stopped at the edge of the dirt.

""I don't like this,"" she whispered, her eyes fixed on the upper windows. ""The house... it looks different from here. Like it's taller.""

""It's just the angle, Tasha. Stay close,"" Tyson said, though he was gripping her arm tighter than he needed to.

As we stepped onto the porch, the smell hit us. It was a thick scent of old grease and copper. 

It smelled like a butcher shop that had been left in the sun.

Rochelle pushed the front door. It didn't creak; it swung open silently, as if the hinges had been freshly oiled.

The foyer was a cavern of shadows. Rochelle’s flashlight beam cut through the dark, revealing peeling wallpaper and a floor covered in a thick layer of grey dust—except for the center of the room. The dust there had been swept away, leaving a clean, circular patch.

""See?"" Kim whispered, her voice wavering despite her bravado. ""Nothing here. Just an old—""

Creak.

It came from above us. A slow, heavy footstep. Then another. Thud. Thud. Thud.

""Someone is upstairs,"" Tyson whispered, his voice dropping an octave.

I looked toward the back of the house. In the kitchen, I saw a shadow move. 





Not a person-shaped shadow—it was too wide, too low to the ground. It darted across the doorway and vanished.

""Did you see that?"" I asked, my throat dry.

""See what?"" Rico asked, but he was staring at the hallway mirror. ""Ant... look at the mirror.""

The mirror was cracked, a jagged line splitting it in half. In the reflection, the hallway behind us wasn't empty. There were shapes—pale, blurred faces peering out from the darkness of the dining room. But when I turned around, there was nothing but shadows.

""I feel sick,"" Tasha said, her breath hitching. ""The walls... they’re vibrating.""

She was right. I put my hand against the foyer wall. It wasn't solid. It felt like it was pulsing, 

a slow, rhythmic throb that matched the heavy footsteps upstairs.

Suddenly, the silence was shattered.

CRASH.

A sound like a thousand panes of glass shattering exploded from the basement. It was followed by a horrific, metallic screech—the sound of iron being twisted and torn apart. The entire house shuddered, the floorboards bucking under our feet.

""GET OUT!"" Tyson screamed.

We didn't need to be told twice. We scrambled for the door, tumbling over each other in a blind panic. We didn't stop until we were back in Rico's living room, gasping for air, the sound of that basement crash still ringing in our ears like a physical bruise.

We slammed the door and locked it. But as I looked at the wood of the door, I realized something.

The thudding from earlier hadn't stopped. It was just quieter now. 





The living room felt different when we burst back in. It wasn't just that we were spooked; the space itself felt like it had been violated. 

The warmth was gone, replaced by a damp, stagnant chill that seemed to seep out of the vents.

""Did you hear that? That wasn't no squatter!"" Rico yelled, his chest heaving. 

""That sound in the basement... that was metal. Like someone was ripping the furnace out of the floor!""

Tyson slammed his back against the front door, his eyes wide. ""I'm tellin' y'all, I saw something in the kitchen. It was too big to be a dog. It was like... grey. And slick.""

""Y'all are just trippin' now,"" Kim snapped, though her hands were shoved deep into her pockets to hide the shaking. 

""Fear makes you see stuff. Adrenaline, man. We went in, we got scared, we ran. That’s it. It’s over.""

""It's not over,"" Tasha whispered, sitting on the very edge of the couch. I can still feel it. Like a ringing in my ears.""





We spent the next hour bickering, trying to rationalize the irrational. 

Rochelle was pacing, her face set in a hard mask of ""big sister"" responsibility.

""Everyone just calm down,"" she commanded. ""It’s 11:30. We’re inside. The door is locked. We are fine."" 

She walked over to the coffee table where she’d left her schoolwork. She paused, her brow furrowed. ""Wait... where's my Trig book?""

""You probably left it in the kitchen,"" I said.

""No, Ant. I left it right here. On top of my notebook.""

The book was gone. Not just moved—gone. We checked under the couch, the kitchen table, even the bathroom. Nothing. It was like the house had simply swallowed it.

BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.

We all jumped. The sound was coming from the kitchen. We scrambled in to find the microwave running. The timer was counting down from 99:99, and the turntable was spinning empty.

""Who touched the microwave?"" Rochelle demanded.

""Nobody's been in here!"" Rico shouted, hitting the 'Cancel' button. 

The machine died, but the smell of burnt popcorn and old copper—the same smell from the House—wafted out of the vents.





A minute later, Kim went to the bathroom to splash water on her face. 

We were all still in the kitchen when we heard the scream. It wasn't a ""scary movie"" scream; it was a genuine, throat-tearing shriek of pure terror.

We found her collapsed on the bathroom floor, pointing at the vanity mirror.

""His face!"" she sobbed, clutching Rochelle’s waist. ""Tyson... I looked in the mirror, and Tyson was standing behind me, 

but he didn't have no eyes! Just black holes and... and hair! 

Long, black hair coming out of his mouth!""

Tyson looked at his own reflection. He looked normal. 

Terrified, but normal. ""I’m right here, Kim! I didn't even leave the hallway!""

""It’s the house,"" Tasha said, her voice dead and flat. 

By 1:00 AM, we tried to force a sense of normalcy. Rico popped a VHS of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles into the player.

""Just watch the movie,"" he muttered. ""Focus on the turtles. Focus on New York. Not Detroit.""

We huddled together on the floor and the couch. 





For twenty minutes, it worked. 

Michelangelo was making jokes about pizza, and we were actually starting to breathe again. 

Then, the screen glitched. High-voltage static tore across the image, turning the green of the turtles into a sickly, bruised purple.

The audio slowed down, the voices dropping into a deep, demonic growl. The scene shifted. 

It wasn't New York anymore. It was a grainy, black-and-white shot of a basement. 

Rico's basement. I saw the stairs—the ones we had walked past a hundred times. 

A figure was huddled in the corner, wrapped in a tattered floral dress. She was hunched over something, her back to the camera.

Then, she turned her head. It wasn't a face. It was a snout. Wet, pink, and twitching.





The screen snapped back to the movie. Leonardo was swinging his katanas.

""Did... did y'all see that?"" I asked, my voice trembling.

""See what?"" Tyson asked, though he was gripping the armrest so hard his knuckles were white. 

""It was just a tracking error. Old tape, Ant. Just an old tape.""

Around 2:30 AM, screams started outside. They were distant at first, echoing down the block. 

It sounded like someone being chased, or maybe a drunk losing their mind.

""Just crackheads,"" Rico whispered, though he didn't sound convinced. ""Block is always loud on Fridays.""

But the screams didn't move past the house. They stayed right outside the window. 

And then, they changed. They didn't sound like screams anymore. 

They sounded like someone trying to imitate a human voice—a high, mocking ""Help me! Please help me!"" that ended in a wet, rhythmic snorting.





We decided to sleep in a pack in the living room. Lights on, TV on mute.

Sleep was a joke. I’d drift off for ten minutes only to wake up because I felt something brushing against my hair. 

I’d look up and see a shape—a tall, hunched shadow—standing by the coat rack. 

But when I rubbed my eyes, it was just the coats.

""Ant,"" Rico whispered from the floor beside me. ""Did you say my name?""

""No, man.""

""Someone whispered 'Rico' right in my ear,"" he said, his voice shaking. 

""It sounded like my mom, but... but wrong. Like she was talking through water.""

At 4:00 AM, every light in the house—the lamps, the overheads, the porch light—snapped on at once. 

The glare was blinding. We all bolted upright, shielding our eyes. A second later, they all died. Complete, crushing darkness.

""Rochelle?"" I called out.

""I’m here,"" she gasped. ""Nobody move.""

Then came the sound.

Jiggle. Jiggle. Scrape.





Someone was at the front door. Not knocking. 

They were trying the handle. Slow. Deliberate. 

Then, the sound of a key—or something like a key—scraping against the lock.

Scritch. Scritch. Scritch.

Tyson grabbed a baseball bat from the corner and crept toward the door, his breath shaky. He looked through the peephole. 

He stayed there for a long time, frozen.

""Tyson?"" I whispered. ""Who is it?""

He backed away from the door, his face completely bloodless. 

""Nobody,"" he whispered. ""There’s nobody on the porch. But the handle... the handle is still turning.""

We watched as the brass knob twisted all the way to the left, then all the way to the right. Over and over. For twenty minutes.

None of us slept after that. 

We sat in the dark, listening to the house breathe. 

When the first grey light of Saturday morning finally bled through the curtains, we weren't relieved. We were exhausted, frayed, and haunted.





We looked at each other in the morning light. 

We looked like we’d aged ten years. Tasha was staring at the wall, her eyes unfocused.

""It’s Saturday,"" I said, trying to find a spark of hope. 

But as I looked at the front door, I saw something that made my heart stop. 

On the inside of the door, right above the deadbolt, were three deep, vertical gouges in the wood. Like claws had been trying to get out.

""Look at the door,"" I whispered, my voice sounding like I’d swallowed gravel.

The others crowded around. Rico reached out, his fingers hovering just inches from the three deep, jagged gouges in the wood. 

They weren't just scratches; the wood had been splintered and peeled back, as if something with incredible strength—and no patience—had been raking at the door from the inside.





""That wasn't there when Ma left,"" Rochelle said, her voice trembling. ""I cleaned this door yesterday. I would’ve seen that.""

""Maybe it's the wood rotting?"" Kim suggested, though she sounded like she was trying to convince herself.

""Wood doesn't rot into claw marks, Kim,"" Tyson snapped. He rubbed his eyes, his face etched with exhaustion. 

""Man, I didn't sleep for more than twenty minutes. Every time I closed my eyes, I heard that... that sound. 

Like it was right under the floorboards.""

""I'm going home,"" Tasha said suddenly. She was standing by the window, her arms wrapped so tightly around herself it looked like she was trying to disappear. ""I can't stay here.""

""Tasha, wait,"" Rochelle said, stepping toward her. ""You can't leave me here with just the boys all weekend. 

My mom won't be back until Monday morning, you know on Saturdays and Sundays she go to her man's house after work. Please stay.""

""Yeah, girl,"" Kim added, throwing a subtle, playful look my way 

that felt completely out of place given the gouges on the door. 

""I didn't say I was going home. If Ant is staying, I’m staying. We just need to reset. Get some fresh air. Get away from this block for a minute.""

Tyson nodded, leaning his head against the wall. 

""If Ant is in, I'm in. Rico's mom already said it was cool. We just need to move around. I feel like I'm stagnant in here.""





Tasha looked at all of us, her gaze lingering on the field outside. She sighed, a long, defeated sound. 

""Fine. I’ll stay. But I need to get clothes. And my toothbrush. I can't stay in these clothes for two more days.""

""Me too,"" Kim and Tyson said in unison.

""I'm starving,"" Rico groaned, his stomach letting out a loud growl. 

""Let's hit the Coney Island down the street for breakfast. I got some money left."" 

""I can pay."" 

""We can pay, I added."" then we’ll hit Tasha’s house first since she’s the closest, then the rest of y’all.""

""Wait,"" Rochelle said, ever the general. ""Before we go anywhere, we are not leaving this house a mess. 

Put the blankets away, stack the pillows, and someone empty the trash. If Ma comes home to a wreck, 

we’re all dead, ghost or no ghost.""

We spent the next half hour in a blur of forced productivity. 

It felt good to move, to do something normal like folding a quilt, even if I kept glancing at the hallway mirror every time I passed it. 

By 9:00 AM, the sun was trying its best to pierce through the Detroit haze, and we stepped out onto Faircrest.

The walk to the Coney Island was quiet. We passed the field, and I swear the House looked smaller in the daylight—shabbier, less imposing. 

It was just a ruin. 

Or so I wanted to believe.





Inside the Coney Island, the smell of grease and grilled onions usually made my mouth water. Today, it made me nauseous.

We sat in a red vinyl booth that had seen better decades. A waitress with a tired bun and a name tag that said 'Doris' walked over, her notepad ready.

""What can I get you kids?"" she asked, her voice raspy from years of cigarettes.

""Breakfast platter, extra bacon,"" Tyson said.

Doris scribbled it down. ""One plate of raw dog, hold the hair,"" she muttered.

Tyson froze. ""Wait, what did you say?""

Doris looked up, blinking. ""I said, one breakfast platter, extra bacon. You okay, sugar? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

Tyson swallowed hard. ""Yeah... yeah, my bad. I just... I misheard you.""

I looked over at the large mirror behind the counter. For a split second, I saw a reflection of our booth. 

But instead of the six of us, the booth was packed with shadows—dark, upright shapes with no features. 

I blinked, and it was just us again. Kim was checking her hair, and Rico was picking at a loose thread on the table.

Suddenly, the bell above the door chimed. I looked toward the entrance. 

A tall figure in a tattered floral dress stepped inside, its head ducked low. 

I felt a jolt of ice water hit my veins. Rochelle and Rico both jerked their heads toward the door at the same time.





But when the door finished swinging shut, there was no one there. The entryway was empty. The bell was still vibrating.

""Did you see—"" Rico started.

""Yeah,"" I whispered.

""See what?"" Kim asked, looking between us. ""Nobody came in.""

""Never mind,"" Rochelle said, though she was gripping her fork so hard her knuckles were white. ""Let's just eat and get out of here.""

After breakfast, we started the walk toward Tasha’s house. We had to cut through the edge of the local park. 

Usually, on a Saturday morning, you'd see kids on the swings or guys playing basketball. But the park was empty.

As we walked past the line of trees, I saw a shape in the distance. It was standing near the slide. It looked like a person, but the proportions were all wrong—the arms were too long, reaching down past its knees. It was hunched over, moving in a strange, jerky rhythm.

""Look,"" I pointed.

Tyson and Rico looked. The shape was there for a heartbeat, a dark blot against the rusted playground equipment. Then, we all blinked, and it was gone. Just the empty swing set, swaying slightly in a wind we couldn't feel.

""We need to hurry,"" Tasha whispered, her pace quickening. ""I don't want to be out here. I don't want to be anywhere.""

We kept moving, the sun feeling cold on our skin, instead of giving off its normal warmth.





A few hours have passed, since we went with Kim & them to get their stuff. On the way back we stopped at Wizard's Arcade.

The arcade was a neon-soaked cathedral of bleeps, bloops, and the heavy scent of ozone and floor wax. 

For a while, the 90s vibe of the place actually worked. 

We dropped our bags of clothes by the prize counter and dove into the rows of cabinets.

""Ant, if you pick Ryu one more time, I’m unplugging the machine,"" Rico shouted over the roar of Marvel vs. Capcom. ""You’re trash with anybody else!""

""I’m a specialist, Rico! There’s a difference!"" I shot back, slamming the buttons. 

""And don't talk to me about trash when you still can't beat the first boss in Metal Slug without using five continues.""

""Yo, move over,"" Tyson said, looming over us with a handful of quarters. ""Y'all both scrubs. I’ll run the winner.""

We were laughing, trash-talking like the night before was just a bad dream. 

Kim was dominating a Dance Dance Revolution machine, her movements sharp and confident, 

while Rochelle and Tasha hovered near the air hockey table. For two hours, we were just kids again.

But the arcade was... sick.

Every twenty minutes, the lights would dim, and the cabinets would let out a collective, electronic moan as the power surged.

""Sorry, babies!"" Mrs. Love, yelled from behind the counter. ""City’s been working on the lines all day. Transformers are acting up!"" 

Mrs. Love has been runnin' the place as long as any of us could remember.

We nodded, accepting the excuse, but the glitches started getting specific. 





I was playing Mortal Kombat when the screen tore. Instead of Sub-Zero, the pixels bled into a grainy image of a face—not a face, really, 

but a distorted mask of pink flesh with wet, black holes where eyes should be. 

I jumped back, but by the time the screen flickered again, the game was normal.

""Did you hear that?"" Tasha asked, walking over to us. She looked pale. 

""I was playing Pac-Man, and when I died, the speakers didn't make the 'womp-womp' sound. It sounded like... like someone screaming underwater.""

""It’s just a crowded arcade, Tasha,"" Tyson said, though he was staring at a Daytona USA machine that was showing a video of an empty,

dark hallway instead of a race track. ""All these machines are old as dirt. 

They’re bound to act weird with the power surges.""

Around 6:30 PM, the biggest surge yet hit. The arcade went pitch black for five full seconds. In that silence, the crowded room went dead quiet. 

No one moved. No one spoke. Then, the lights hummed back to life, and I looked out the front window.

The streetlights were already on. The orange glow was reflecting off the sidewalk like pools of oil.

""Time to go,"" Rochelle said, her voice leaving no room for argument. 

""We gotta get back before the neighborhood gets too rowdy.""





On the way back, we stopped at 'Ray’s Corner Store'.

""Alright, who's going in?"" I asked. ""Ray's gonna have a heart attack if all six of us walk in there at once. 

He already thinks we're a gang just because we're wearing hoodies.""

""I’ll go,"" Tyson said. ""I need my Red Faygo and some Hot Fries.""

""I'm going too,"" Kim said, grabbing Tyson’s arm. ""I need my chocolate. Ant, what you want?""

""Get me a Lemon-Lime Gatorade and some barbecue chips,"" I said. 

Rico and the girls gave their orders, and we watched Tyson and Kim disappear inside.

The four of us—Rochelle, Me, Tasha and Rico, waited on the sidewalk. 

The streetlights above us were buzzing with a high-pitched, angry hum, flickering in a way that made our shadows dance and stretch unnaturally.

""Today is just... off,"" Tasha whispered, looking up at the sky. ""It’s too quiet. Even for a Saturday.""

""It’s just the power stuff,"" Rochelle said, though she kept looking over her shoulder toward the field.

""The whole grid is probably messed up. Hey, Ant, when we get back, we finishing that Martin marathon?""

""Man, forget Martin,"" Rico chimed in. ""We gotta watch Tales from the Hood. It's a classic.""

BANG.





A massive, metallic crash echoed from the alleyway behind the store. It sounded like an industrial dumpster had been picked up and slammed 

against the brick wall. We all jumped, Rico nearly tripping over his own feet.

""What the hell was that?"" I hissed.

A second later, a scruffy-looking guy stumbled out from behind the trash bins, muttering to himself and kicking a loose can.

 He didn't even look at us as he wandered off down the street.

""Just a crackhead,"" Rochelle sighed, her hand over her heart. ""My god, we are all on edge.""

Tyson and Kim kicked the door open, laughing and carrying two plastic bags overflowing with junk food. 

Kim walked straight up to me, pulling out my Gatorade. She leaned in close, giving me a smirk and a quick wink.

""Here you go, Spec-Ops,"" she teased, her eyes lingering on mine for a second longer than usual. 

""Don't say I never did nothing for you.""





We turned onto Faircrest, the bags of snacks crinkling in the quiet night. But as we got within fifty yards of the house, the atmosphere curdled.

Every dog on the block started barking. Not the usual ""mailman is here"" bark, 

but a frantic, terrified howling. It was a chorus of desperate sounds, coming from backyards and porches all down the street. 

It felt like they were all facing the same direction.

They were barking at the field.

We stopped at the edge of Rico’s porch. The dogs were losing their minds, their voices raw and strained. 

We stood there for a long beat, looking at the empty lot next door. The House wasn't very visible in the dark, 

just a darker shape against the black sky.

""Inside,"" Rochelle whispered. ""Now.""

We didn't argue. We stepped inside and locked the door, but for the first time, the locks felt like they were made of glass.





The transition from the arcade's neon buzz to the suffocating quiet of the house was jarring.

We put on Martin, and for a while, the slapstick comedy and the canned laughter acted like a shield. 

We were laughing, shoving barbecue chips into our mouths, and acting like we weren't all hyper-aware of every floorboard that groaned.

But Tasha... she wasn't laughing. Every few minutes, her head would snap toward the window, her eyes fixed on the black void where the field began.

Around 9:00 PM, the house phone rang, the sharp, old-school trill making us all jump.

""Hey, Ma,"" Rochelle said, her voice instantly shifting into 'responsible daughter' mode. 

We could hear the muffled, scratchy voice of Michelle on the other end. 

""Yeah, we’re good. No, nobody’s been outside. Okay... yeah, the dresser? Got it."" She hung up and looked at us. 

""Ma said we can order pizza. She left money in her room.""

The argument over toppings was the most normal we had felt in forty-eight hours. Meat-lovers versus pepperoni, thin crust versus thick.

It was a beautiful, mundane distraction. By 10:00 PM, the pizza guy arrived. 

Rochelle paid him through a cracked door, her eyes scanning the dark porch before she snatched the boxes and slammed the bolt home.





We swapped over to Tales from the Hood. The irony of watching a horror movie wasn't lost on us, but it felt like if we leaned into the fear, 

maybe it would stop sneaking up on us.

Around 10:30 PM, the sky finally broke. 

A low rumble of thunder vibrated the floorboards, followed by a torrential downpour that turned the windows into blurred, weeping sheets of glass. 

The lightning was sudden and violent. During one particularly bright flash, the light hit the TV screen just right. 

I saw a reflection in the glass—someone standing right behind the couch. A tall, hunched shape with a thick, fleshy neck. 

I whipped my head around.

Nothing but the wall and the coat rack.

I looked at Rico. He wasn't watching the movie. He was staring at the window, his face illuminated by a jagged streak of lightning. 

""Ant,"" he whispered. ""I swear I just saw a light in the House. Like a candle moving past the upstairs window.""",3,1771058905.0,nosleep,0,0.81,False
1r4fqpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/hangzhou/comments/1r4fqpl/february_in_hangzhou_plum_blossom_hunting_season/,February in Hangzhou = Plum Blossom Hunting Season,"Every February, Hangzhou feels different. As Spring Festival approaches, the city quietly turns red and white, but not from lanterns, but from plum blossoms.

This, to me, is Hangzhou’s most underrated romantic season. During the Spring Festival holiday, why not start your spring plum wandering right now? 

I am now trying to make a plum blossom map and share with you who also a plum lover.



1. **Lingfeng — The Classic Plum Sea** 

https://preview.redd.it/3wbtgbc1bfjg1.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=613a455efd52af333c7587d96ff46ca5d9f8007e

Inside Hangzhou Botanical Garden, Lingfeng is probably the most iconic plum blossom spot with more than 5,000 trees and over 100 varieties of plums. When they peak, the whole hillside looks like pink mist floating in the air.

Tips: If it’s your first plum season in Hangzhou, start here. Go early morning for soft light and fewer crowds.

Location: Hangzhou Botanical Garden, No.1 Taoyuanling, Xihu District

Transportation: Take bus No.28/82/27/15 to “Hangzhou Botanical Garden” stop

Admissions: 10 yuan (about 1.45 dollars)

 

2. **Xixi National Wetland Park— Plum Blossoms along the waterways**

https://preview.redd.it/6akguoc9bfjg1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=29aadcec01c89bbfbf25e1d21734abcb380c2564

At Xixi National Wetland Park, you can take a small rowing boat through narrow waterways lined with over 20,000 plum trees. You’ll see petals floating on the water, reeds shaking in the wind, and it just feels peaceful.

Location: No. 518, Tianmushan Road, Xihu District

Transportation: Take Metro Line 3 to South Xixi National Wetland Park station

Admissions: 80 yuan (about 11.6 dollars) and the electronic boat costs 60 yuan (about 8.7 dollars)

 

3. **Chaoshan Mountain — Ten Miles of Fragrant Snow**

https://preview.redd.it/a2powtc9bfjg1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d5940792136a96cc3fdac25042e53db903c0ce5

More than 50,000 plum trees are stretching across the hills. It’s known as one of the three major plum blossom destinations in Hangzhou. During peak bloom, locals call it “Ten Miles of Plum Blossom Snow Sea.” When it’s in full bloom, it’s honestly overwhelming in the best way.

Location: Chaoshan Scenic Area, Tangqi Town, Linping District

Transportation: Take Metro Line 9 to Heyu Road station and take a taxi or self-drive (parking lot available)

Admissions: 40 yuan (about 5.8 dollars)

 

4. **Gu Shan (Solitary Hill)  — Literary Plum Vibes**

https://preview.redd.it/gmcrtqc9bfjg1.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=bacbf32a34d06cebbc170385865d83c2bd2b7034

This place is linked to the Song dynasty poet Lin Bu, who famously described plum blossoms with the line: “Shadows slant across clear shallow waters; Fragrance floats under the dim moonlight.”

Location:

Transportation: Take Bus No.7/118/27/510 to Xinxin Hotel stop and walk for 900m.

 

5. **Huiyin Gaoli Temple — Plum blossoms and Zen**

https://preview.redd.it/hcgpw92abfjg1.png?width=428&format=png&auto=webp&s=e827d170683fe998bacedfa0bb2caeb0a729aafe

One of my favorite niche spots is Huiyin Gaoli Temple. Bright yellow temple walls paired with deep red plum blossoms create a warm, almost meditative atmosphere.

Location: No. 149-1 Santaishan Road, Xihu District

Transprtation: Take bus No.194/318 to Yuhu Bay stop and walk for less than 5 mins.

 

**When Should You Go?**

The ideal plum blooming temperature is 5–15°C, so it’s better for you to see them on Sunny days. By mid-February (basically right now!), Hangzhou is hitting peak plum blossom season. Mid-to-late varieties like Longyou plum, Gongfen, and Green Calyx are all starting to bloom at the same time. The blossoms should last through late February and remain in bloom later than they did during  the same period last year.

If you’re in Hangzhou right now, don’t wait for full-on spring. Just grab a coffee, pick a random sunny morning, and go wander somewhere with plum trees.

**Evening snack**:

1 guava + amul high protein lassi (alternate days)

**Pre-workout**:

1 banana + 1 spoon peanut butter + black coffee

**Dinner**:

2 chapati + dal + 100g rice + 200g air-fried chicken breast

\- Fats: \~55g

I have some sweet treats (ice cream, mithai), fast food once in a while (once in 7-10 days kind of thing).

I don’t track calories actively, just do a rough estimate, and it’s been working fine for me so far.

Before I go buying official bean packs just to dissect a tag, I wondered if anyone here has already looked into it.

Specifically:

	•	Are the NFC tags standard NTAG213/215/216 (or similar)?

	•	Do they store actual recipe data (grind, temp, yield, etc.) in NDEF format?

	•	Or is the machine just reading the UID and mapping it internally to a stored profile?

	•	Are the tags locked / password protected / encrypted?

When I put my iPhone near the machine’s reader, Apple Pay activates, so it seems to be standard ISO14443 NFC.

I’m not trying to pirate anything — just genuinely curious whether it’s possible to:

	•	Clone existing tags

	•	Create custom tags for different beans

	•	Or assign your own profiles to new NFC stickers

If anyone has scanned one of the official tags with NFC Tools (or similar), I’d love to know what tag type it shows and whether the memory is readable/writable.

Here’s the bit. My daughter is an absolute handful compared to many other children her age. She’s two, and when she was a baby, I wanted another child (she was an easy baby). The older she gets, the more sure I am about being OAD.

She requires attention every second of every day. She will not play independently for even a second. The whining starts in the morning the moment she wakes up, she doesn’t like to snuggle, and if I don’t interact with her for one second she will scream and whine. I can’t even drink my coffee on the couch without her climbing all over me whining. And even while I interact with her (playing, reading etc) she will constantly whine and throw tantrums if something doesn’t go her way. She can’t sit down for one second, so we can never go to a restaurant. Even at the playground she rather just tries to run away than actually use the playground. She needs constant supervision or she will run away, climb furniture, or get into other dangerous things.

I’ve tried everything, I’ve tried to set boundaries, but she’s just so difficult. I’ve talked to many other parents with children the same age, and I’ve see how they act, and I’m a 100% sure my daughter is a lot more difficult than most children her age. So, I just don’t see how I could ever add another child to this, unless she suddenly gets easier at 4+ years, but then it’s gonna be too late as I’m already in my late thirties. I do think that if I had an easier child, I would have probably had a second child.

# SECTION B: BREAKDOWN OF STEPS

Week 1: Join 5 Meetup groups (hiking, board games, book club), RSVP to 2 events this week, prepare conversation starters.  
Week 2: Attend 2 events, initiate conversations with 5+ people per event, exchange Instagram/phone numbers with 2-3 connections.  
Week 3: Attend 3 events (mix of groups), follow up with Week 2 contacts via text, invite 1-2 people for coffee outside Meetup.  
Week 4: Attend 3 final events, solidify 5 friendships through one-on-one hangouts, create group chat with new friends.

She told me she had plans to grab coffee on Friday with a guy she knew from high school and wanted to give me a heads up.

She explained that he used to have feelings for her and even confessed his love at one point, but she rejected him. They were close friends in high school, but she said they haven’t talked in about three years.

I felt uncomfortable with the idea of her meeting up with him, especially knowing he had feelings for her in the past. It didn’t make me feel secure. I was also bothered that she told me after the plans were already set instead of talking to me beforehand. On top of that, she admitted she hadn’t planned to tell me at first because her sister advised her not to, since she thought it would hurt my feelings. That part upset me as well.

I asked more questions and wanted to see the messages. She gave me her phone. I noticed they don’t follow each other on Instagram, so he had to request to message her and she accepted it. In the messages, she did clearly say she has a boyfriend, which made me feel somewhat better.

What makes this harder for me is that something similar happened with us in the past. About two years ago, we went on a few dates but it didn’t work out. A year later, I reached out to her because I still liked her. At the time, she had a boyfriend. She agreed to grab coffee with me, but I declined because I knew she was in a relationship and I didn’t want to disrespect her boyfriend. Because of that experience, it’s hard not to see the parallel.

I really didn’t like the idea of them going out one onone. I didn’t feel comfortable, and when I tried to explain that, she pushed back on my feelings. I gave her a hypothetical and asked how she would feel if I went out one on one with a girl who used to like me. She said it would be fine.

This is where I messed up. I felt like I couldn’t get her to understand my point. Out of pettiness, I followed a girl who used to have a crush on me on Instagram. My intentions weren’t good. I wanted her to feel the same hurt I was feeling. I felt like that was the only way to show her how much it affected me. I know that was wrong. It was immature and reactive, and I regret it.

Later, she apologized and said she understood my point of view. But she also said she feels like I don’t trust her, and that what I did was horrible. She said even though she told me it was okay in the  hypothetical, I should have known it would hurt her, and that by doing it anyway, I broke trust and it can’t just be regained easily.

The next day, we had another conversation and decided it would be best to take a break. She’s torn between breaking up and staying together. She says she really loves me, but she can’t get past what I did. She wants time to reflect and figure out what the best decision is moving forward.

I know I acted immaturely, and I regret following that girl on Instagram. I did it out of hurt and pettiness, and that’s on me. At the same time, I was genuinely hurt by the situation too. I didn’t feel heard, and I reacted instead of handling it the right way.

Now I don’t really know what to do on my end. I’m sitting here feeling regretful about my reaction but also still hurt by how everything started. I’m not sure what the best move is, and I’m trying to figure out what I should do from here. Thanks

TL;DR:

My girlfriend planned a one onone coffee with a guy who used to have feelings for her and told me after it was set. I felt uncomfortable and unheard, reacted immaturely by following a girl who used to like me out of pettiness, and now we’re on a break because she says I broke her trust.

1r4fbuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_regularprintbrampton/comments/1r4fbuf/why_business_cards_still_rule_brampton/,Why Business Cards Still Rule Brampton,"In an era of LinkedIn QR codes and digital wallets, you might think the paper business card is a relic of the past. But walk into any networking event at the Brampton Board of Trade or a coffee meeting at Rose Theatre, and you’ll see the truth: the physical exchange of a card is still the most powerful way to seal a deal.

For Brampton entrepreneurs, a business card isn't just a piece of paper. It’s a physical extension of your brand that works even when the Wi-Fi fails.

# 1. Local Trends: What’s Working in 2026?

Brampton’s business scene is diverse, from tech startups in the Innovation District to established trades and retail. Here is what’s trending this year:

* **Tactile Finishes:** People are moving away from flimsy paper. Think Velvet Laminate or Raised Spot UV that makes your logo literally pop.
* **Eco-Friendly Stocks:** With Brampton's focus on sustainability, cards made from 100% recycled post-consumer waste or ""tree-free"" cotton are huge conversation starters.
* **The ""Hybrid"" Card:** Smart cards that feature a QR code linking directly to your Portfolio or WhatsApp are now the standard, bridging the gap between physical and digital.

# 2. Choosing Your Brampton Printing Partner

You don’t need to look far to get world-class quality. Brampton is home to several top-tier printing hubs. When choosing a local shop, consider these factors:

* **Digital vs. Offset:** If you need 50 cards for a meeting tomorrow, Digital Printing (like at *The UPS Store* or *Print Three*) is your best bet. For 1,000+ cards with better color accuracy, look for Offset Printing specialists.
* **Turnaround Time:** Many local shops on Queen Street or near Steeles & Torbram offer same-day or 24-hour ""rush"" services for those last-minute networking emergencies.
* **In-House Design:** Not a designer? Many Brampton printers offer in-house graphic design to ensure your bleed lines and resolution are perfect before the ink hits the paper.

# 3. Quick Cost Guide

While prices vary based on paper weight (gsm) and finishes, here is what you can generally expect in the Brampton market:

* **Basic (500 cards):** Approximately $25 – $45
* **Premium (Painted edges/Foil):** Approximately $80 – $150
* **Plastic/Metal Cards:** Typically start at $150+ for smaller runs.

3 months ago, I had my blood work done and the results were alarming.

My triglycerides were very high (\~600, maximum is 165), my HDL was low (“good cholesterol”), my cholesterol was 230+ (max 200), HBa1c is 5.9 (borderline pre-diabetic if not managed ahead of time).

Fast forward to 3 months after — my lipid profile has significantly improved.

My triglycerides are now much lower, VLDL and cholesterol are more controlled. More importantly, I feel better, lighter, and more aware of how my body responds to food and habits.

Even though I wasn’t eating a lot of sugary foods before the first blood test, my blood test says otherwise.

I decided to take it seriously and make changes — no crash diets, no extremes (hindi ko ginutom ang sarili ko!), just consistent habits and controlled intake.

\*\*Here’s what I focused on:\*\*

• Cut down snacks (junk food, fried food, street foods, breads)

• Reduced white rice (I still ate 1 to 1.5 cups per meal) and refined carbs (breads and other starchy or flour-made products)

• Chose boiled, grilled, or steamed food whenever possible

• Started eating a simple breakfast (3 boiled eggs)

• Improved hydration

• Became more mindful of meal timing

• Added omega-3 supplements  (fish oil) 

• Paid attention not just to sugar, but to overall carbs and fats

• Fenofibrate (as prescribed by my doctor) helped significantly in lowering my triglycerides

• No sugar in coffee (just creamer), no softdrinks, and no sugary beverages

I also learned that:

• High triglycerides aren’t just about sugar. Very high TG can damage the liver. 

• Fried food + refined carbs + poor timing can do a lot of damage

• I never eat carb-heavy or sugary food from 12 MN to 5 AM

• 14-hour intermittent fasting: dinner at 6 PM, breakfast (3 boiled eggs) at 8–9 AM the next day

• I never force myself to feel “hungry”, because extreme hunger is more detrimental than being helpful

\*\*Posting this because:\*\*

• I think this is not too much of an effort to do

• Anyone who thinks “I don’t eat sweets, so I’m safe” (I thought that too)

• Anyone who needs a reminder that it’s reversible if you act early

Still a work in progress — but definitely a step in the right direction.
