1gnon8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gnon8g/my_uncle_matt_never_existed/,My Uncle Matt Never Existed,"My family and I have been going through a very strange experience over the last couple of months. It's hard to even put into words or explain *what* is going on. I guess I can just start off from where it all started to feel off. 



A few months back my family had a big get-together. My parents both have two siblings. They all got married and had some kids. Well, all of them except Uncle Matt. He never got married or had kids. That means I have ten cousins. My aunts and uncles all live within two hours of us so we’ve all grown up together. 



That being said, we don't normally have all my aunts and uncles in a house at once, this was a rare occasion to have a family meal when they were all free.



I will not be naming every single family member in this post because that seems like a lot of information and honestly, you've already gotten more information about my family than you ever wanted, but I promise this context is important. 



Okay, enough with my babbling. Let's talk about what happened that weird night. 



My parents and I went over to my Aunt Margo and Uncle Ken’s house for a BBQ in the backyard. The backyard felt loud and chaotic. I tried to stay out of the way and get the night over with. I was honestly just there for the free food.



We were all sitting down at a big table outside. I was so focused on making sure none of the napkins went flying in the wind I wasn't listening to the conversation. My aunt Margo came over to the table with a plate of really burnt hot dogs. My mom immediately started to laugh at the sight of them.



“Is burning food genetic or something? How on earth do you guys always do that to food? The Jensens need to leave the cooking to the Millers.” My mom said with a sarcastic giggle. Uncle Ken looked at her confused. 



“What are you on about Liz? Uncle Ken snapped back.



“I mean, Margo burnt the hot dogs and Matt always burns food when he cooks. Remember we had to ban him for months from cooking because we had to order takeout like three times in a row.” Everyone at the table laughed recalling their memories. Sighs of recollection bounced back and forth from person to person when my dad spoke up in Aunt Margos' defense. 



“Honey, what are you talking about? Matt is your brother. I really shouldn't have to remind you of that.” My mom rolled her eyes in response to my dad.



I spoke up because I was suddenly confused about which side of the family Uncle Matt was actually on. You would think I would naturally just know that, but all my aunts and uncles act like siblings and call each other their siblings. My grandparents often refer to their son/daughter-in-laws as just their kids so it isn't something I always think about.



“Wait, I'm confused. Whose side is Uncle Matt on? What is the joke? I don't get it.” I asked but was only met with a laugh from all the parents at the table. I finally got an answer from my mom following the silence of the joke that somehow went over my head.



“Don't be silly baby, Matt is your dad's brother.” As the words left her mouth half the table looked confused. 



“Liz, what are you talking about? He is on your side. He is a Miller.” My aunt Margo said as she scraped off the burnt edges of her hot dog. 



“Okay, Now I’m with Amanda. I don't get the joke.” My mom said while looking at me with narrow inquisitive eyes and then at the rest of the group. 



“Wait, wait, everyone slow down.” Aunt June said, speaking up for probably the first time in the night. “This is dumb. Matt is not Liz and I’s brother. He has to be on the Jensen's side of the family.” 



I sat at the table watching my family in silence. Their eyes darted back and forth. They stopped laughing and were all just scratching their heads. 



After a few minutes, my mom got out her phone. She found an old family photo from when she was a kid. In the photo were her, my grandparents, my uncle Paul, and my aunt June. Nothing out of the ordinary. After looking at the picture, Aunt Margo got out *her* phone and looked for an old childhood photo. 



“Ah ha! Found one.” She stated as she showed off the photo on her phone. Yet again, the photo was normal. It had my grandparents, my dad, Aunt Margo, and Aunt Susan. 



The next hour consisted of both sides of the family going back and forth showing photos. None of them with Uncle Matt in them.



I had a few of my cousins there, but they all lost interest once they ate. I on the other hand couldn't be pulled away. I was engrossed in learning where the heck Uncle Matt came from. 



They kept talking back and forth. They figured maybe he wasn't anyone's sibling. Maybe he was related by marriage or a second cousin twice removed that I just called ‘Uncle Matt’ because that was the easiest thing to call him. We all have a relative like that, right?  



I know an easy solution you might be thinking of is to just call him up. That's also what I said but he was working and they didn't want to interrupt him, but guess what? I needed answers so I decided to call him. However, when I looked at my phone I couldn't find him In my contacts. I looked through it multiple times. I remembered texting him about something a few days back so he should’ve been in my text history. Still nothing. 



After being weirded out by his contact being gone, I mentioned out loud that someone should call him. Regardless of him being at work. No one agreed with me, but once I told them his contact was missing from my phone they all got curious and looked to see if he was missing for them too. 



We were all in shock to find him missing from all our phones. 



The family started to dig through their camera rolls and any digital libraries they had to try and find any photo of him. Uncle Andrew thought he had a photo of the back of him, but we soon found that we all remembered him looking differently. 



Uncle Andrew showed a picture of the back of a bald man who looked pretty tall. Aunt June called him crazy and recalled him having long curly red hair. 



It wasn’t like we hadn’t seen him in a year or that he was some kind of distant memory. I saw the guy last week. He came over to my house to help me with some homework, and I can tell you he didn’t have red hair or no hair at all, he was, well, shoot... I can’t remember what he looked like now that I think about it. 



It was safe to say we were all creeped out. As the sun went down and it got chilly out, the group moved inside. Normally, this is when everyone would go home, but I saw Aunt Margo start a pot of coffee. It was going to be a long night. The air was tense and full of unease. None of the adults wanted to go home until they had answers. 



I could tell the adults wanted to talk more but didn’t want to worry the younger cousins. My older cousin Maddy clearly didn’t care about anything that was going on. She just wanted to sleep. We convinced her to take my three young cousins into the basement so they could all get some sleep. But not me, I was invested. Uncle Matt and I are close. We see each other all the time. How could I not have a shred of evidence that he even existed? 



As my cousins shuffled downstairs, all the adults huddled around a big whiteboard Aunt Margo slapped on the kitchen island. They started to write down everything they could remember. What he looked like, the last time they saw him, memories of him. None of it was coherent. It seemed he was a completely different person in all our memories. Even if it was a memory where multiple people were around. 



One of the only things that we could all agree on was that the Jensens always thought he was on the Miller side of the family and the Millers always thought he was on the Jensen side. 



My Mom recalled a story of Matt and my dad going to a lake to fish, but the hook got stuck on Matt’s hat and went flying. My dad told us he remembered my mom telling him the same exact story many times. 



Everyone had memories of stories where he was on the other side of the family. 



Soon everyone was on the phone with a new family member trying to tell them the situation and asking what they thought about everything. My aunts and uncles were talking to realities on the phone I didn’t know I had. Relatives that probably only met Matt a couple times at best. All I heard was one dead end at a time. No one knew where he came from or where he went.



So the big question was *who is Matt?* Was he just some random guy who weaseled his way into the family? Telling one side of the family one thing and the other side another? Or was it something *so* much worse? 



As the sun came up that Saturday morning we were all still scratching our heads. The deeper we got into who Matt was, the more freaked out everyone got. I was honestly surprised they let me stay with them all night long. 



The more digging everyone did, the farther away we felt. The more rabbit holes we went down the less real he seemed. We couldn’t find any evidence that he ever existed. Some of us searched all over the internet for ‘Matt Jensen’, or ‘Matt Miller’ and a few of us searched for other last names in the family. Of course, it was kind of hard to know who we were looking for given we didn’t know what he *really* looked like. 



After hours of discussion, we compiled a list of attributes that never wavered about Uncle Matt. 



He was a man, he never had a mustache, he was tall, he was bad at math, and he loved Jim Carrey movies. 



That might seem like a random grouping of facts, but that's because it was. We couldn’t even remember where his house was. Some of us completely forgot and others remembered different houses. It didn’t matter. We weren’t going to start knocking on doors to find a man we were concerned never existed. 



We started to believe that as soon as we began to question who he was he just simply started to fade away into nothingness. Like it was some kind of self-destructive on his own consciousness. 



It was around 9 a.m. that morning when people started to fall asleep on couches. The night before started with everyone being determined and saying the night wouldn’t end until we found Uncle Matt, but here we all were. Exhausted and with little to no answers. It felt like accepting defeat by napping on the couch but we couldn’t do much else. 



At 11 a.m. we all woke up to the sound of my cousins playing in the next room over. We all sat up and rubbed our eyes. You could practically see the gears turning in everyone’s heads as they woke up from their stupors. I could tell when they realized their memories actually happened and it wasn’t just a weird fever dream. 



My Aunt Margo stumbled to the kitchen while yawning and started to dig in the pantry for something substantial the kids could all eat. It was clear they had alrighty raided the cookie stash. 



As the adults had a quiet conversation we heard something come from my Cousin Kass that made us freeze. 



“Yeah, remember last night when Uncle Matt gave us all those cookies! It was so much fun!” My small cousin said with a hop and a skip. 



“Wait Kass, get over here and say that again.” My uncle Andrew yelled in an attempt to sound intimidating but came out with a voice crack. 



Kass walked over to us looking like a confused puppy who just got yelled at. 



“What did I do wrong Uncle Andrew? I thought if Uncle Matt offered us cookies I could have them?”



“Kass, you are not in trouble. This is very important…are you telling me Uncle Matt was with you guys last night?” Uncle Andrew tried to say in a gentle tone to not scare Kass. 



“I mean, not the whole night but he brought us all cookies and put a movie on for us. Then he said he wanted to go hang out with you guys upstairs.” Kass told us with a quiet voice. 



Everyone started to frantically look around the room. Looking for any evidence of him being there last night. We quickly asked the rest of the cousins if they saw Matt and some kids did and some didn’t.  



I noticed something when I started to count the objects in the room. There were ten adults and me upstairs last night. So, there should've been eleven people in total, but I saw twelve plates out with the leftover crumbs from our late-night pizza, twelve spots laid out for sleeping in the living room, and twelve mugs or cups of coffee. 



He was here last night. 



As I mentioned what I found, my dad said he remembered seeing him last night. He said Matt brought him some water. Uncle Paul said he saw him go to the bathroom but couldn’t remember him coming out. 



They mentioned how it felt like it never actually happened but he managed to place the memory in them after the fact. How else would they see Uncle Matt right in front of them and not realize what was happening?



I had a strange feeling that started to bubble up. I felt uneasy and restless. 



“Wait, something is off here,” I said loudly to the room. “Everyone line up on the wall, I want to try something.” 



For a second they all looked at me confused. They normally wouldn’t let me boss them around like that, but they were desperate and tired. 



All the adults lined up against the wall. As I walked by then I counted out loud. Something strange happened. I counted twelve people including me. None of the kids were lined up. I wasn’t counting myself twice. There was an extra person. Uncle Matt wasn’t just here last night. He was with us in the room at that moment. 



Other members of the family even tried to count. We did it over and over again. Even adding one of the kids to the mix, but every single time there was one extra person, but we still couldn’t see him? How was he hiding in plain sight? 



Everyone ended up leaving my Aunt Margo’s house that afternoon. We were all still extremely creeped out about the whole thing, but what could we do about it? Not much. It’s not like Uncle Matt ever did anything violent. Mostly normal behavior except for a few memories of him that were kinda weird. One of us remembered seeing him in the kitchen, stacking and unstacking bowls for hours. Another person remembered him once packing for a vacation but his suitcase only had trash bags in it. And I have a memory of us sitting in front of a fireplace with him reading the instruction manual to a blender for a bedtime story. 



At least those were the kind of memories we had in the beginning. As the weeks went on, we started to remember things that got more and more concerning. He showed up in our houses in the middle of the night. Or buying us all hammers for Christmas. He once bought hundreds of dollars worth of knives and put them in my Dad’s car. 



Once we developed disturbing memories of him, we tried to tell the police. Of course, they couldn’t find any evidence of his existence so they couldn’t help us. It didn’t help our case that we couldn’t even give them a last name. How on earth are they supposed to find a guy based on his name being Matt and no physical features



So who is Uncle Matt? I can say with one hundred percent certainty, I have no clue. Is he a man? Is he an entity? Is he a figment of our imaginations? Or is he nothing at all? I don’t know. And that’s the worst part of all. He seems to always be around at family dinners. Most of the time I count the number of people I end up with an extra person. 

  
He feels like a virus. Always implanting a memory of himself being around but in the moment I never see him.  



It seems to be a family joke at this point. Always leaving out an extra plate for him or something. In my opinion, no one is taking this situation seriously. I know he hasn’t hurt anyone, but why should we wait for something to happen? I swear I can *feel* it when he shows up. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up. My family has given up on trying to figure out who or *what* Uncle Matt is. But I haven’t. 



It feels like they have all just forgotten the disturbing memories of him. I swear the deeper I dig to find him, the worse the memories get. Like he is rotting and festering in my memories. Right before my eyes. I'm starting to think it's his attempt to stop me from looking for him. The fact that he is punishing me for looking for him makes my concern grow more and more. Why is he suddenly running now that I am on to him? Why is he so afraid of me finding him? And what will happen once I do find him?



I will find you, Uncle Matt. I will find out *what* you are.",1,1731199845.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1gnomn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1gnomn4/losing_my_mind_how_do_i_believe_hes_telling_it/,Losing my mind. How do I believe he’s telling it “all” when after 9 years of compulsive hiding and lying. ,"First time posting and apologies it's going to be long. I'm really struggling and don't know what to do. My husband and I have been together for a total of 9 years and married for 7 of those. Over the course of these 9 years we have had repeated issues of him hiding porn and now emotionally cheating. I am at such a loss because other aspects of our relationship are great. He's a great dad and a good husband aside from these things.

A big issue is that with every single instance of catching him, it takes days/weeks to pull the whole truth out of him. He's a horrible liar and easy to tell when he is, but he's EXCELLENT at hiding and denying. So now every time something comes out, I can never believe he's truly telling it all. Because every other time I have had to pull the truth out of him piece by piece. Because of some of my past trauma, lying is a huge trigger for me. I can work through things and handle them as long as you are honest about it, no matter how bad it is.

The first signs/fights over hiding things involved excessive porn use. Once before we were married in 2016, once while we were going through infertility in 2018, and again when my daughter was a newborn in 2020. Ever since the first time I have told him how the porn was a nonnegotiable for me. It damaged my self esteem, my self worth, and it hurt like hell. He explained that to him the porn was his way to relieve stress and he had been addicted to it since he was very young.
He sought therapy and I really think he has finally overcome it since the 2020 incident. I haven't caught him since. I'm also admittedly, I chronic over-thinker.

Fast forward to now in 2024, our big issue is him hiding interactions, texts, and calls with a female coworker. He works as a probation officer  and his office location is next to all the other female officers. One of the females is much younger in age, has less experience as an officer, and is single. We will call her “C”. He had mentioned C to me before when talking about work in passing. I have even met C last year as I work in public education and she is assigned to come to our school to do safety checks once a week. I noticed towards May that she hadn’t been by but didn’t think much of it. In September we were sitting in the living room I asked to use his phone. I truly wasn’t looking for anything because I didn’t suspect anything. However I stumbled across that he had deleted a text from her that said “don’t ignore me”. 

I immediately got upset. I asked if he had deleted text with her and he admitted yes. I didn’t understand why. Over the course of days (as usual) he admitted that he and her had gotten a little too casual but nothing ever physical. I went through all other calls and text history and realized he had been in contact with her A LOT. Like 10x more than other coworkers. He claimed it was all work and just because they would rely on each others help (they aren’t partners). But if it’s just work then why hide it? And why would he want to rely on a small, young, less experienced female officer over the males or females with more experience? He said that the particular text made him realize that they were too casual. Then my mind is thinking…I wonder if she hasn’t been coming to the school because she doesn’t want to see me because something is going on between them.
I eventually dug more details out about him and her that do not happen with other coworkers:
-He has at times brought her coffee and her favorite soda.
-A few months ago someone was leaving post it notes on C’s desk saying hi. It became an office mystery of who was doing it/why. All the other female workers asked my husband if it was him. He said it was not and he went and talked to C about how he considered something like that playful flirty and that he would not do that because he was committed to his wife.
-He has told her things about our personal life like our previous issues with infertility with our first born and how we are going through it again now trying to have a second.
-She has spoken about her sex life and “being horny” in front of him. He said it was not directed at him but she openly talked about it while in his presence.
-She has asked him to come into work early because she needed his help immediately with someone being violent towards her…instead of just asking someone already in the office.
-He frequently complains to me about having to pick up the slack of other officers but never her. And based off of what I can see he is always drops everything to help her.

It’s like I had to piece all of this together for him to show that obviously there was some sort of connection with her that he didn’t have with others. And that if he has to hide it from me…then it’s because it’s inappropriate. He swore there was nothing physical and no blatant flirting. But I said this is it. I told him I was done with the constant lying, hiding, and not being open with me. He begged and pleaded for us to not separate. He promised he was going to be completely open and honest about everything. I asked that he tell her that he thought they were being too casual and needed to be more professional. He did have that conversation with her and she said she understood. I told him I didn’t want to nag him, or babysit him. I want to trust him. I know he still has to work and have interactions with her. I asked just that if he did tell me if anything happened to just tell me and that if they did have to go somewhere alone together to just tell me.

Things were good for 3 weeks. I didn’t even ask about her because I didn’t want to nag and I wanted to trust him. Then last Saturday I brought up not seeing her for months doing school security checks. He made A LOT of excuses for her and it brought up a red flag for me. I finally asked if anything has happened since the last fight about her. He said no. Then yet again, he finally admitted that last Wednesday and Thursday they went alone together to places on assignment. He admitted he didn’t like it and knew I would want to know. I could scream. IF ITS WORK THEN WHY NOT TELL ME?! At first he said that both times he was ordered by his chief but then admitted that the second time it was because she asked him. He complains about being behind on his own caseload and work but he so willingly drops things to help her? There are 11 other offices besides the 2 of them that she could go to for help. But no, she always goes to him and him to her.

I love him. I consider him my best friend. We were going through fertility treatments again to have a second child. I want to be with him. The last week I have warned him this is it. I’ve barely spoken to him. I’ve made us sleep in separate beds. He has cried and begged and signed up for therapy. He says he doesn’t tell me things because he doesn’t want to fight and is scared of loosing me. He also claims he thinks of these things as small and not necessary to tell me. 

I still feel like there is more…because there always has been before. How can I ever trust him? Why does he compulsively lie? I have explained over and over again if he is just upfront with me then I won’t get mad. What do I do? My mind is spinning, I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. It’s killing me not knowing if there is more.

IF YOU JUDGE ME THEN... PLEASE DON'T JUDGE ME... IF YOU JUDGE ME YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S WRONG! IF YOU READ IT AND JUDGE ME THEN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK AT ALL (that would be possible and probably normal) idk what to say.... just don't judge me. nobody likes to be judged. 

you'll probably think: ew what a weirdo! 

you wouldn't be wrong to think that but i would feel kind of bad... anyway... i can't force ideas into your mind so let your mind wander wherever it wants but pls enjoy this book
(some of it is true some of it isn't... sometimes your mind can create things out of nothing and in the end you're like wtf but it's still amazing bcs your brain is a living world creating machine! it's literally so cool and so creepy at the same time... but anyway, as i was saying, this book (if i can call it a book) is a soup of randomness combining real and fictive worlds, events, persons, places, etc... a soup. 

(the blender is my brain.)
(maybe i'll try to make it less dark because life isn't always dark... sometimes it is but not always... theres a LOT of happiness in the world and we should really (en profiter au maximum). Please stay safe and be happy. 

if ur not, smile for 30 seconds i saw that on yt) 

SMILE and enjoy everything! sadness is good too. its incredible to think that we can feel sadness like woah... sometimes i feel like i don't want to be sad, I want to stop feeling sadness but that would mean stopping living and that's horrible. NOT LIVING. i wouldn't be immortal but not living, giving up, is really sad, too sad... even sadder than sadness itself... compared to death, sadness is a wonderful state, almost like happiness! 

If you're reading this text... then it means that you're really important to me (or that someone sent it to you!) you're loved, never let anyone tell you otherwise!!!!!!!!!!! 

okay, you read a lot (thx!). here's the book: 

(i am sorry for any mistakes/typos.... some of them are intentional but some aren't) 

I hope you'll love it and hate it as much as i do!
I hope i'll like it too

[THREE]
V.M.M.
Virtual Meat Market
*[BLACKMAILING DISCOUNT FRENZY AT V.M.M.]*
V.M.M. doesn't exist. It's immaterial, virtual. You could compare it to a alley in a supermarket. Soups/sauces, snacks/cookies, milk/cheese... It's not even that big! Just a random alley in a random supermarket... well not really... Because V.M. is the biggest supermarket in the world! It's wonderful! When I say ""super"" I mean something like ""on steroids"" or ""on drugs"" because that's really how it is! Visualize cows on a dairy farm. What do the farmers need to do to make more money? They need to produce more milk, but to do so there aren't a thousand ways... So they ""boost"" the cows. Ehanced championship ready top of podium doped cows! That exactly what they do with the V.M., they boost it to the fucking max. 

YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU CAN OWN ANYTHING YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE NO THIS ISN'T A DREAM YOU'RE NOT UNDER THE  INFLUENCE OF DRUGS THE VIRTUAL WORLD EXISTS!!! EMBRACE THIS WHOLE NEW REALITY THIS MAGICAL WORLD IS WAITING FOR YOU!!! DEMATERIALISE TO GAIN MORE SPACE FOR USELESS TRAUMATIZING THINGS! YOU LOVE THE INTERNET AND THE INTERNET LOVES YOU! 

You'll never break free. 

Drugs
Weapons

.... 

-Honey, I feel like there's something missing...
-Oh, actually I think you forgot the milk.
-Thanks! 
*kiss*
.............
WELCOME TO VIRTUAL MARKET!
(smile for the cameras!)
:):):):):):):):):):):):):):)
*supermarket jingle*
*muzak*
The signs over the alleys read:
- A Lot Of People's Lives (100% discount on products you personally know!!!)
-Worldwide Products!!! (exotic products!!! some even manufactured by real slaves!!!)
-Unreleased/Banned Products! (drugs, humans, weapons...!)
-Entertainement For Humans! (litterature! cinematography! sports! pornography! games! and much more!!!)
...
alleys never stop appearing at the Virtual Market, it's a never ending cycle. They just appear... They're not there but the moment you blink... thousands of new alleys appear. 

They don't have what I fucking want. I want the fucking cure, the answers. They don't have that, I can only trust myself. DOCTORS NEED TO GET PAYED AND I GOTTA GO TO SCHOOL... (actually does it cost money to go see a doc? probably not... forget what I said...) I can't ask a doctor to give me the cure because it doesn't physically exist... actually the cure could be ""telling my brain to shut the fuck up because I have my own creativity, ideas and my way is special in its own way."" but it's oh so hard to accept this answer, to swallow this pill, to let your body process the molecules.... I HATE IT. I hate overthinking, jealousy, complicated relationships... NOT HAVING WHAT THE FUCK I WANT! Give me what i want. I'm not asking to God or anyone... I'm just asking. ASK AND U SHALL RECEIVEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! Imagine being your best friend, but like actually. You both like the same things, you do everything together, you listen to the same music, you have the same friends.... Imagine liking yourself 100%... but not to a sexual extent... just liking yourself. It probably isn't possible.

# *[MILULU'S SAGA]* by lulubenene

# MILULU'S BEACH.
Today, I went to the beach. It was really fun. Water, sand and people.

But something happened.

I was playing a game on my phone bcs i didn't want to go swim, get wet... Yeah I know, I'm boring, but I also really wanted to start playing that goddamn game (Subarashiki Hibi). So there I was, sitting in a tent, hiding from the sun reading a vn. Balls occasionally hitting the tent. At one point, i had to go pee, like I HAD TO FUCKING PEE. I started looking for a washroom. It was located at the fucking exact opposite of where we were. I passed by strangers, barbecues and clouds of flies. THE FUCKING MEN WASHROOM WAS CLOSED BCS THE JANITOR WAS CLEANING IT. So i took a place in line, waiting for the door to open. A man, took place next to me. After some time, the door finally opened! I entered a stall and the man entered the one next to mine. I sat down and peed. I felt something on my leg, i looked down. Liquid was dripping off of the other's stall wall, forming a puddle. Drops splish splashing on my leg. EW EW EWE EW THE MAN WAS PISSING ON THE WALL AND HIS URINE WAS ON ME. STOP STOP STOP. I was so fucking disgusted. Pee y'all, fucking piss. CAN'T YOU FUCKING LEARN HOW TO AIM YOU DUMBASS MOTHERFUCKER!? IF YOU REALLY CAN'T JUST FUCKING SIT DOWN ON THE DAMN TOILET. I moved away from the wall and the puddle as much as I could. Fuck. Even so, his piss was still splish splashing on me. The was my first golden shower i guess? Hahaha. When he finally got out, urine was still dripping off of the wall into the yellow puddle. My feelings were all mixed up, I felt like crying and laughing at the same time. I silently laughed out of uneasiness. This stranger just (accidentally?) peed on me. Well, at least it wasn't in my mouth or something... I got out of the stall in a state of panic. How tf was i supposed to wash piss off of my legs at the beach?? Taking a swim seemed like the most logical option, but I wouldn't feel comfortable with a soap-free option... I also could put soap all over my legs... How tf would i rinse it??? By taking a fucking swim? Yeah, but the beach was like really far away, that meant walking with hand soap all over my legs in front of strangers. I used wet paper towels to wash off as much pee as i could, washed my hands and got out. That's when i saw it! God didn't abandon me! A bottle of hand sanitizer!!!! I put an outrageously big amount of hand sanitizer in my hands and rubbed it all over my legs. Drunk legs, surgery room level sanitized legs. The new cocktail: legs, water, salt, sweat, urine, alcohol. I passed the BBQs, the strangers and the clouds a flies, swallowing some bugs on my way to the tent. Seasoned legs and fresh living protein snacks, that's what i got from the washroom.

# MILULU'S NYC.
I LOVED GOING TO NEW YORK! What a beautiful city. There's a lot of people there, rich ones and poor ones. We saw a lot of things! The Statue Of Liberty, Ground Zero, World Trade Center, Grand Central Terminal...
One of my favorite was Summit One Vanderbilt. It's a huge tower, the highest in New York. We took an elevator that took us like 90 floors high in like 40 seconds. Flashing, mirror covered elevator. Metallic decors, mirror floors, huge windows, silver balloons, art expo... Everything was beautiful, EVEN THE WASHROOM!! There was fog but it was still very beautiful and impressive. We went to so many different places. The amount of people is overwhelming. Umbrellas, flowers and ponchos sellers. We walked a lot, went in various stores! We even went to the UGG store! We also went to the Nike store. SHOES, THERE'S SHOES EVERYWHERE! I walked around. I had to pee, again. So i looked for a washroom. It was located in a creepy hallway.  As i was walking, i saw two men talking. I noticed the washrooms' doors. I didn't know if the men were waiting to go or if they were waiting for someone so I tried to open one of the doors. As soon as I opened the door, I heard a steady rhythm. Breathing. Up, down. I WAS LOOKING AT A STRANGER JERKING OFF. He was facing the wall, aiming for the toilet. His right arm beating the shit out of his meat. He didn't even turn back to look at me. I don't even think that he knew I was there. I closed the door. I walked away pretty fast. The I heard one of the two men say: ""You good bro?"" I was like WHAT THE FUCK? Was he talking to me or to the dude who was jerking off behind the unlocked door???? Like, yo. I loved NYC. Y'ALL SHOULD GO TO NYC!

# MILULU'S FAKE LOVE CONFESSION.

Yeah. The title.

I used to use Discord a lot. A WHOLE FUCKING LOT. I ""knew"" a lot of people. During my downward spiralling, I met a Brasilian boy online. Here's what he told me:
He's around 14
He's Brasilian
He's a boy
He used to send nudes to strangers
He doesn't have a lot of friends irl
... Blah blahhhh

We made a promise: Never send nudes to strangers ever again and never watch shota ever again. In my opinion, that isn't a bad idea... I think that there shouldn't be any children doing disgusting things for adults.

We failed. I told him that I had failed and he told me that he had also failed. He felt so fucking bad. He kept saying that he was a mess. He wanted to kill himslef. He told me that he was drunk and that his parents were away. I tried to calm him down. I was so fucking stressed out. I was trying to save someone's life in the middle of the night. 

Then, one night, during a family party, he texted me to confess his feelings... What the fuck was i supposed to do? I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO KILL HIMSELF.... so i told him that i loved him too... I know it's wrong, but like... Idk what would've happened if I told him that he didn't interest me bcs BRO I DON'T FUCKING KNOW YOU, I NEVER EVEN TOUCHED OR SAW YOU. he was happy, but still a bit depressed.

Then he started saying lover typa things. He wanted us to share nudes bcs ""that's the kinda things a couple do"". I refused because we promised to never do that again. I told him to do as he wanted, but that I wouldn't send nudes. He sent a dick pic. I didn't know what to answer. Since I didn't instantly answer, he deleted the picture and started saying that he was so stupid and that I didn't like him... He started to panic and all. I was scared as fuck. Only I knew that he was depressed. Well, actually i still don't know if it was just a lie or if it was true. I don't really want to know.

I don't even remember if I told him ""bye"" when i deleted my account. I don't think i did, but idk.

I just wanted to get rid of everything.

# MILULU'S NON-CON FANTASY.
Once, I went to the beach(?). I was wearing shorts that were a little too short for me. I was picking up pebbles to do ricochets. Then i saw a group of men. I wanted them to look at me, to want me. Every single pebble picking movement was planned. Bend over, arch your back, get back up in a tantalizing way...... I wanted to trap them. I wanted to get trapped by them. But like wtf was I expecting? To be able to turn three men into gay pedophiles? Well, i was trying. Rape me. 
Life isn't a porn film. People don't just randomly fuck eachother for no reason. There's laws. Adults can't fuck kids. Pedophilia is really bad

# MILULU'S DRUNK CALL.
Drink, after drink, after drink. Shots, shots, shots. Cake and chips. Water. Heyyyyyy!!!!
I called my friends while i was drunk. It was fun, but not the next day. You feel so slutty when your drunk. So free. But when you're too drunk, you just feel like shit.

# MILULU'S NEW FRIEND.
I met this Asian girl online. She was pretty nice and normal at first. We were talking about our favorite mangas and other things. At one point, we started talking about our kinks. Her's were shota and guro. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT WEIRD ASS PSYCHOPATIC PEDOPHILIAC MIX????!!! GURL- girl was a pedonecrophile. She made me join a private server with her friends. It was full of gory shota content. Dead  or beat up manga boys in inappropriate positions. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!? At that moment I didn't really care because, she wasn't mean to me, she actually was pretty nice. But now that i think about it, this girl had a serious problem.

# MILULU'S BEDROOM.
there's this atmosphere in a bedroom.
It's reassuring but worrying. It's your space but you're away from everyone. You feel like you should be with everyone else, but you just do nothing. You have to force yourself to get up and leave that comfort. You have to leave your comfort to use your time. You feel like you have to do all these things, but do you really have to? I just wanna be always comfortable. I wanna gain knowledge, skills and experience while being comfortable. But you get nothing if you do nothing. Doing nothing isn't fun. But how am I supposed to be 100% comfortable when I'm not good at something? What's better?

# MILULU'S BRIDGE.
The bridge. One week out of two, I walk home from school. I have to cross that bridge. It's usually windy. Comfortable during summer, cold as fuck during winter. Sometimes, I stop to look at the water under me. Sometimes throwing things in the water. It really beautiful. But it's dirty bcs of pollution. What would it feel like to jump in the water? I don't want to do it i am just wondering. How high, how long, how scary, how cold? I'll never jump off that bridge because, why would I? I'm not depressed, I live a beautiful life.

Fucking mess, talentless mess

# MILULU'S HATRED (random) (extremely abridged sample)


(sorry, WELL ACTUALLY BRUH NAH FUCK OFF, WHY WOULD I HAVE TO BE SORRY, I'M A GODDAMN ARTIST! A VISIONARY! I AM ART!)

I fucking hate school. I don't get how there's people who want to become teachers. A shitty job. You're in school during your youth and you go back to school during your adulthood. What the fuck. Help. Who wants to get mocked by stupid teenagers.

AHWHSHDBFJ I don't.

I hate.
I just hate.
Idk what but i do.
I'm mad at something.
Something's missing.
The missing piece.
There's a hole inside of me. I mean there's many holes outside and inside of me but there's one specific hole that just moves around and changes shape inside of me. I hate it. It's longing ig. Longing for ""something"". Something unknown. I long for success maybe?

HAHAHSHWBSID FBF IF SOMEONE READS THIS THEY'LL BE LIKE: WHAT THE FUCK? I don't get it? 

I can't help you understand i don't even understand it myself.
It's just
It's just a canvas with parts of my brain squished, pasted, stapled, emptied all over it. 
I'm having fun for real, writing is fun. When you start it's like a waterfall, it's endless.
Thoughts.

It's just another random text. I guess someone might've written some sentences i write with the words disposed differently in other contexts hahahahahah lets make some!!!

Sentences with shuffled words.

5555 words. It must be a sign. (More like 666 or 69 hahsheonadjfkdn)

Okayyyyy so. Lets pick a random sentence!

-there's this atmosphere in a bedroom.

1gnofj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gnofj5/lets_talk_about_sex/,Let's talk about sex!! ,"How soon into a dating situation is it reasonable to start discussing sex.

I've been abstaining from casual sex for the last few years, (almost 4) got some trauma and a few bits from ex lovers so I've just decided to stop entertaining sex outside of committed relationships. 

However I'm wondering when in dating is a good time to discuss this with a potential partner. 

As an example I feel like on a first date, over coffee that discussing sexual compatibility or desires and what not would be reasonably inappropriate. However I also don't want to lead a woman on who's possibly just looking to get laid, as I'm simply not in a place where I would enterian or enjoy summin like that. 

So the question is when is a reasonable time to be discussing sex when beginning to date someone. Especially when sex is something that is very important, and not something that you take lightly. 

Cheers guys.

The Emerald City. A place where dreams are built and lives are lived. It’s a city of constant change, and sometimes, that change means a little inconvenience.  This weekend, for instance,  five Link light rail stations in Downtown Seattle will be shut down.  Ermenildo Valdez Castro, Jr., or Ernie to my friends,  has been living in this city for almost 20 years, and I can tell you, a weekend without the Link is like trying to write a novel without a pen: a real challenge.  

The shutdown, which starts at 10 p.m. on Friday and ends at 5 a.m. on Monday, is part of the expansion of the Link light rail system to the Eastside.  I’ve always felt that the Eastside had a charm that was missing in the city center, and this expansion will only make it more accessible. I can almost taste the coffee and smell the fresh air from across the lake! But, back to the reality of this weekend.  

While the Link is down, Sound Transit will be running shuttle buses to connect the closed stations. This will be my commute for the weekend. I’m not complaining, really, but I’ve always felt that the Link was a little more efficient than the buses. And this is coming from a guy who has seen his share of traffic jams in both Manila and Seattle. My time is precious, and every minute saved means more time to write or read. I guess I’ll be reading more this weekend.  

The closure will affect a lot of people, but it’s a necessary evil.  The expansion of the Link is a big project, and it will benefit everyone in the long run.  This weekend, I’ll be taking the shuttle bus, and I’ll be writing about my experience.  I’m sure it will be an adventure.  I’ll keep you updated.

1gnobgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1gnobgq/my_husband_almost_cheated_on_me_am_i_wrong_for/,"My husband almost cheated on me, am I wrong for feeling this hurt? ","
Me (f31), my husband (M30) and Jenny (f34) 
Over a week ago my husband almost cheated on me.
We work for the same company, and he had hired a girl around a month ago, we all became great friends, we drank together often, we went out in town and even bought a trip to NY for the holidays for the 3 of us ( my first time in NY). 
I started sensing a “vibe” going on, they have very similar life stories, he was going out of his way to make things for her, would make her coffee or buy her cake from the store across the street (but saying it was for us both) and other stuff. I just brushed it off, gaslighted myself that I was seeing things or if there was any flirting it was innocent. At the end we were all friends and I didn’t thought much of it.

He and her spend a lot of time together due to the nature of their work, I work for a different side of the company. 
He started to know a lot about her personal life, about her relationships, the affair she had with her previous boss that was married, he even know when she was on her pms. I even joked that they were husband and wife at work. 

Over a week ago we were all working late, everyone had left but us so they decided to drink while working, I was drinking too, but in reality they just sat and chatted while I was working from my computer. Eventually (3am) I decide to go home because I had to be back early in the am. They stayed while opening the 3rd bottle of champagne. 

I got home with a feeling that something might’ve happen, but I convinced myself I was just inventing in my head. 

I woke up at 7:00 bursting in anxiety and he wasn’t home. I started to get ready to go to work and at 8:30 his iPad got a message from her saying “I can still smell you on me”. At 9 am he walked into the house, drunk and went to bed. 
I checked his phone and he had deleted the message before getting home.

Everything went to shit after that, I couldn’t work that day I was having panic attacks non stop, imagining what had happened.

I confronted her about it, I asked how long it had been going on, she said nothing happened, I asked what time she left, she lied to me about it. Him and I didn’t talk until the next day, he was drunk most of the day still. 

The next day, on the day of our 6 year anniversary, we talked. He said nothing happened, they started doing the work they were supposed to do and at one point she ripped the shirt he was wearing, kinda like a movie scene you know, like the guy have a button up shirt and she ripped open.
At this moment he said that they had a “moment” they almost kissed.
But he said they stopped and that was it, they both got uncomfortable and he felt guilty. And left for home after.

Our relationship hasn’t been good for a few years but we were working on it, or so I thought.

My idea of cheating is if you do anything that you feel you need to hide from your partner, that’s cheating.

I feel like he had took many choices that led him to almost kissing her,  and then trying to delete to concise the truth from me.
He admitted he knew there was a vibe going on but he says he thought I was involved on it (I’m bisexual and we had 1 3way before with a friend 3 years ago).

I consider all of this cheating, I’m extremely heart broken and in so much pain, I cry everyday, I have panic attacks, my chest hurt, I feel betrayed.

He is frustrated I’m insisting on this, he says it wasn’t as a big deal as I’m making, that I’m making it more than it was. 

The girl, let’s call her Jenny, had told me that same day about her old boss whom she had an affair with, she even hide into his guest bedroom while his wife was home. At one point she asked me if I was the jealous kind, and I said no, if another woman can have him, then he is not mine.

I feel like she got him, he made multiple choices to get to that point, he put himself in that situation and I was not even a thought in his mind.

Am I wrong to be this hurt and betrayed? To be seriously considering that this is the end of our relationship?

i had a horrible childhood, starting with my abusive mom and nonchalant dad, my mother was extremely abusive to my siblings and me, me being the youngest i was always the golden child, i couldnt be seen with bruises, so instead of hitting me she would keep me awake or do things to give me nightmares like lock me in a closet for hours on end (i no longer live with her due to seperate reasons) well, as i have grown up, my mind gives me chronic nightmares, along with insomnia due to the fear of going to sleep. 

the dreams all started around 2-3 years ago. i would wake up, about to go to school and as soon as i leave the door i would wake up again. it gradually got worse, from me actually having the memories of the dream as if they were real, and now its to the point of me questioning reality, as if i could do drastic things to get myself out of the “dream” state. 

i have gone to burning myself to “wake up” when in reality i was already awake. last night, i had one of those dreams, or i think it was a dream, i still dont know if i am real right now or not? anyway i was in bed, woke up, made me some coffee, ate breakfast, then decided to go to the bathroom. 

i went to the bathroom, took a shower, just the general getting ready stuff, but as soon as i saw the mirror i knew something was wrong, i had never seen my reflection in a dream, and i guess my brain couldnt register it because the mirror was just black, pitch black, as if there was some kind of dark void behind it. 

then, i woke up, confused i just figured it was a bad dream, that was until i went into my kitchen to see the windows now black, like my house was floating in some void, i got scared obviously and went into the bathroom, as soon as i say the mirror again (still black) i woke up. at this point i am horrified, i dont know whats happening so i just immediately look out my window next to my bed, black again. 

i wake up. i am now crying, i run to the bathroom to see the mirror now normal. you think i would be happy, right? i had no reflection. i looked out the window to see mirrors everywhere, i woke up. but instead of waking up in bed, i am now in my bathroom, looking down as i sit on the ground. i look up at the mirror and i see my mother, but its me?

i wake up. and now here comes the present. i am currently sitting on the ground in my bathroom, scared out of my mind to look out the window or at the mirror. i dont know if i am real and im too scared to find out. somebody, please help me.",2,1731198393.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1gno5hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1gno5hw/how_to_set_boundaries_with_boreddestructive_cat/,How to set boundaries with bored/destructive cat,"I apologize in advance for the long post- I need all the help I can get. I am at my wits' end.

Firstly, I love my cat, Geoffrey. He is spunky and assertive and playful. And very tenacious... 

That being said, he seems to need more play and attention than what me and my partner can provide him. Many friends and acquaintances have suggested getting him a friend to keep him company... but that's double the litterboxes, the food, etc. I am still open to it but I am worried that it wouldn't work out. 

He's a rescue and around 2 years old. Me and my partner found him when he was possibly 6 months old.  

**His current schedule...**

5-6:30 am he'll wake us up for food... and want to play. I'm familiar with the hunt, eat, groom, sleep pattern that cats tend to have but I can't play with my cat at 5 am when I've just woken up. I wish I could but I can't, I'm too tired. After I've fed him, I'll try to go back to bed but he will scratch at the carpet until I get up for good. We keep the door closed because if we don't he'll hop on things and purposefully knock things over to get our attention and wake us up. When we have tried to keep the door open, he doesn't seem to understand that nighttime/bed time is sleep time. 

Around 7:30/8 am, once I am up for good, I make my coffee and grab a book/play and take him outside for supervised outdoor time. He will scratch at the carpet in front of the front door and yowl to be let outside (yes... he is fixed). He lets me know when he wants to go back inside and then I try to play with him. He prefers to hunt his toys so I try to do that but lately he has been indulging me for like 5 minutes and will then lay down. I'll think he's done and head over to my desk to work and then 1 minute later he's meowing as if I neglect him. 

10-11:30 am he'll settle in for a nap. Enough said lol. 

2:30-3:30 sometimes he wakes up from his nap and wants a little snack. Sometimes he goes back to bed and sometimes he wants to play. 

Around sunset hour he gets hyper again (them being crepuscular and all) and so I play with him. He gets bored super easily. I try to switch up his toys often but he gets bored of them after a few days. Which leads to him only feeling interested in playing for 5-10 minutes. He usually begs to go outside again around this time. I usually wait until he has a calm moment around the apartment to let him outside because I don't want it to seem like I'm giving into him. He has his outdoor time, we come back in and attempt to play some more. I eventually feed him some dinner.

Finally at night, we shut the door when we sleep because, like I said above, he'll hop around everywhere and knock things down. He sleeps on a comfy chair in the living room. 

**My dilemma...**

At a certain point in the early evening, after I've given him some post-nap attention, I have to get back to my responsibilities (more work, chores, writing/art) and he will meow for hours and scratch at the front door to be let outside. I try to play with him but I have to finish work, clean, cook, finish writing a chapter, learn lines for acting school. 

He has absolutely destroyed parts of our carpet when he is in his restless, angsty state. Nothing works to deter him. I have tried absolutely everything and he fights through it all. Tin foil, sticky tape, barricade, scratcher, odor spray... he still scratches away at the carpet that he's able to access. I make sure he gets at least 30 minutes of play a day but that doesn't seem to be enough for him anymore. I am so sad at the idea of him being miserable. I want him to be happy and content and I don't know what else to do. I've read to ignore naughty behavior but his naughty behavior is destructive to our apartment. I try to redirect him to his scratchers but he knows that scratching on his scratchers won't get my attention. 

I have absolutely no idea on how to train a cat. I grew up with dogs and they were soooo easy to discipline. I've lived with other cats and they all just wanted to be left to their own devices. I've cat sat for friends and have always thought cats were easy from my experiences with them. 

Lastly, I try to keep him on the same schedule but there are days/weeks when I can't. I struggle with unmedicated ADHD and it's hard giving myself structure. I wing it every minute of the day. 

**What have I not tried??? Please give me tips and pointers.** If I am doing anything wrong please tell me. I want Geoffrey to be happy. ",1,1731198339.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

","Recently I’ve been traveling a lot for some of my welding jobs, nearly 1000 miles a week, give or take. Hasn’t gave me a problem until one night me and a couple other welders were drinking and welding in a garage and needed lights and the battery went out and had to be jumped before we all went to work the next morning. 

Fast forward two weeks and 2.5k more miles later I am leaving an Air B&B to get some coffee before work, and as I pull into the gas station, my LC just shuts off in the middle of the turn leaving me in traffic. Started back up after turning the key but it took a few tries. 12 hour shift later we load up the welding machines on a trailer, some ladders, and then head out for a two hour drive back to our homes. On the way home we drive through the Ocala National Forest, and every thirty minutes my LC stutters, RPMs drop, dash lights and head lights flicker and I stop in traffic. Starts up the same, but the cranking of the engine seems to be struggling. Then two hours away from home I suddenly break down for the last time. 

From the things I’ve read online, and I am not very fluent with mechanical work of any kind, I just glue metal together, I stopped at Napa and grabbed a new “EFI Relay”. LC still only tries to turn over, but won’t start. Looked into it more and it could be the “Fusible Link” but I’m not entirely sure why that would be an issue? 

Does anybody have any sort of idea what I can do, I really don’t want to leave my baby in the forest. I have some photos of the fusible link in case that helps, as well as the load I was hauling in case it has anything to do with that?

I'm still trying to fathom this whole thing out. Is it because a lying, cheating, misogynist rapist is a more appealing president than a woman of colour? Is it the fear of 'immigrants' despite the vast majority of the population being descendants of immigrants? Some of their ancestors were taken to the USA against their will and forced to work for fuck all dollars and fuck all cents.

I read somewhere on this sub that his first policy is targeting transsexuality. If this is true what national problem will that solve? As far as I can tell there have been zero instances where any child has forcibly been subjected to gender reassignment therapy/surgery in the whole world. It's a choice and one that isn't made lightly. And I'm certain that it's a minority of people.

Ah yeah, there we are - let's attack the minorities we don't like. That aren't like us. That will make us great again. Keep going until the roast potato people and mashed potato people wipe each other out. The tea drinkers, fucking perverted deviants are devaluing our coffee, ruining our country. Bastard carrot eaters are a threat to our broccoli industry.

That was a weird dream.

1gnnw8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1gnnw8e/i_have_fallen_for_my_friend/,I have fallen for my friend. ,"This is a long one.. but I am including as much as I can to paint a picture. 

A coworker and I gotten close, we say we are besties (inside joke). He (26) started in February and I (33) didn’t talk to him until May. We began talking more in July, and within a month we had become very close as we related when we both went through a tough breakup earlier this year. He said he doesn’t want to be in a relationship after his ex. We are each others go to person to spill gossip, vent or talk about anything in our lives. We talk a lot at work, eat lunch together, he waits for me to walk out together, carry my stuff at times, he’ll randomly call me on weekends or evenings to just talk, we tease each other, we get flirtatious at times. He does tell me things like “you’re beautiful”, “I believe you can get any guy you want” “you smell amazing” “you’re so much smarter than me, you have a good heart, don’t be anyone’s second choice” when giving me advice about potential dates “you’re the only female I can talk to and tell pretty much everything too. I’ve never experienced it and I enjoy it a lot” “if you leave, I don’t know what I’ll do without you. You’re part of my everyday” (I told him I’m applying elsewhere) he’ll randomly ask me for my hand to see something and he’ll intertwine our fingers to hold my hand for a few seconds. We laugh because he’s so smooth. He’ll grab my arm and hug it, lay on it when we’re sitting together during lunch. He’ll bring me my favorite drinks or candy at times. As do I. He also makes suggestive comments to me, as do I. We have spoken about our sex life with other partners, what we like, don’t like, etc. essentially we are best friends and talk effortlessly. In the recent weeks, he’s been saying that the sex would probably be AMAZING since we already have a strong connection. He says we’re both ‘experienced’ (goes back to our sex talk) and have similar kinks and he can’t get it out of his head how great it would be. He says just one time and we can both decide from there. With this comes some comments about features, how good I look in certain pants, shirts, looking thick, points out a low cut shirt. I do the same with him. Especially when he wears grey sweats. Y’all know the typical jokes that come with guys and grey sweatpants.😅 

I keep saying I don’t want to lose our friendship over this and that he’s already tainted from sleeping with another coworker (teasing him, happened in August) because he is 6 years younger than her. I play hard to get of course because every single cell in my body wants to be with him but I’m scared to admit it. I have fallen for him in the last month. But have kept the same friendship dynamic to not give away anything. No one knows this. Not even my closest friends because he is 7 years younger than me. That’s usually another excuse when I say no to him. Sometimes I say, “fine let’s do it then! Tonight! I’m feeling it!” He gets flustered and says “really! I’m going to message you tonight then” I laugh and say “we’ll see if I respond” and I’ll say I’m kidding. I keep saying I would never do it or go out with someone younger than me. But he keeps on and yes sometimes I go with it because I do like him, I just don’t know if he says these things to me to get in my pants, compliments me as a friend, or if he has true feelings for me. So I keep the same pattern going that I cannot do anything with him. Many people at work ask if we are couple. Some ask him, some ask me. We laugh and say “no we’re just really close friends.” Or “no that’s like my brother/sister” Some say it’s obvious we like each other and point out the way he looks at me, saying we give each other “googly eyes”. Some say we would make a great couple because our chemistry shows. Of course we always tell each other when one of these interactions occur and joke around that we are ending the friendship or cutting the cord so people will stop speculating. But of course we don’t and say “I can’t ever imagine my life without my bestie”

He went as far as calling my ex, pretending to be my boyfriend two week ago and telling him to leave me alone. He was borderline stalking and harassing me with emails, cash apps, voicemails, messages from fake numbers for months. Bestie had enough one day when I told him I received some emails over the weekend and a voicemail, he insisted on calling him to tell him to leave me alone. I was shocked and asked why he would do that for me. He said “because I love you and would do anything for you. I’ll even confront him in person.” I froze. He stared at me. Not sure what he was thinking at that moment it was like I blacked out but I felt almost nauseous of how many butterflies I had. I agreed and he was calm, collected, and said all the right things even when my ex was being an ass. One thing was “I’m just asking you man to man to please leave my girl alone. We are in a great place and you need to move on. She asked me to please let her handle it and I finally agreed but when I’m seeing my person get stressed and frustrated, I will step in to ensure her happiness”  I basically died.😩😩😩 

Now this is where things get tricky. He tells me about the females he talks to, the ones who message him, the ones he says are hot, a dime, etc. I do the same with guys. Just natural as we started off as friends and have done this say the beginning. Ever since he started being suggestive, I will say “you’re too much of a ladies man” or “you have a long roster, can’t have them all coming for me when you fall in love with me” again, teasing, flirting whatever you want to call it. Goes both ways. With females at work, he has made it known to me when he finds them attractive and will ask me if they are married, dating, etc. and act as a supportive wingwomen but never actually set him up or anything. Vise versa! Except he attempted to set me up with one of his friends in September, I said no for a few days then changed my mind to yes because what did I have to lose. Told bestie to give the friend my number, I never got a message and the friend was acting very standoff ish with me. Never mattered to me as to why. I figured he changed his mind. Well!!! I found out earlier this week through the friend, bestie never gave my number and told him I was not interested. I have yet to ask bestie why he did this if he was so adamant about me “going for it”. Another thing, I tell him he’s going through the phase after a hard breakup after a 5 year relationship when mentioning his females. We’ve all been there and I did at his age. I’ll joke and say let me know when you’re done with your phase and we’ll see where I stand with you. Then this week he said he thinks he’s ready to find THE girl and settle down. He hasnt been into any girls and leaves them all on read after a couple of days. I teased a little and then said I was proud of him for admitting it, guys usually run from that. I said I’m sure he can find someone he really likes. He said he already did. Neither one of us said anything and switched topics. 

Anyway, I just got off the phone with him. He called to tell me about his night last night. He was going on a date, never happened, ended up at a football game and saw an old flame. So yes he was with a female and he said he NEEDED to tell me because it happened out of nowhere and wanted me to say I was disappointed in him. I laughed and joked about it of course. We remained on the phone for over an hour, spoke about the guy I’m talking to and how im not feeling it. Spoke about family, weekend plans, friends, just normal conversation with the added, “so you want to come over tonight to watch a movie and cuddle since you’re ending it with _____” I laughed and said “you just never know when to quit do ya.“ and agreed to talk later as we both had to hang up. I do want to say I am simply talking to this other guy. Have gone on one coffee date. Not exclusive whatsoever.

I AM UTTERLY CONFUSED!!!! I know the adult mature thing is to talk to him and tell him how I feel but I don’t want to ruin our friendship dynamic if he doesn’t feel the same way. Two of my friends (one male one female, also work with us) told me he talks about other females to see my reaction or to see if I get jealous and that it may very well not be true of him meeting these girls. They don’t speak to him much but apparently when I’m not around, he’ll ask where I’m at or he’ll be looking around for me when he sees the rest of my team enter the room. Talks highly of me to others or brings me up randomly. Again, I don’t if this is true at all or if it means anything. I honestly don’t know what to do and feel like a teen with a crush. I guess what I’m essentially looking for is advice on what to do and male’s take on this. Is it normal for male friends to act this way with their female friends? Is he just being promiscuous? Am I delusional and the friendship is fake just to get into my pants? Am I reading too much into these things? Is he just hot and bothered due to his age?

If you're unfamiliar with Path of Exile, its an ARPG like diablo 2 that resets every 3(ish) months and adds new content in a themed league. I've played dozens of league starts like this and often take several days off work and real life responsibilities to play as much as possible for the first few days or weeks of the fresh league. I often play 16-18 hour days to get an edge over other players and I wanted to share some of my techniques to make playing the game this way more sustainable and productive. Here they are in no particular order!

  
1) Prep your food in advance.

Most of us aren't kids anymore and the days of being able to order a pizza and a 2 liter of soda and stay up all night playing video games are behind us. Fill your fridge with some healthy food a day or two before league starts. This means food high in protein and complex carbohydrates. This will give you long lasting energy and avoid the energy spike and crash that fast food will cause.   
  
Trade your potato chips and candy for dried meats, fruit, and nuts. Same reasoning here, simple carbs cause a crash and trying to maintain a diet of them will leave you feeling terrible after a day or two.

  
2) Manage your caffeine intake. 

I usually advise people to get the same amount of caffeine they do on any other given day for league start. Its tempting to fill your fridge with coffee or energy drinks but this will also cause your energy to spike and crash and will usually lead to being able to play less and less efficiently. 

3) Get some exercise for goodness sake.

If you're already an avid exerciser you're at an advantage here. But getting your body moving for even 30 minutes a day will increase your focus and energy throughout your gaming session, leading to more efficient play. Even taking a short walk every day will put you at an advantage over other players. Also, and probably more importantly, sitting for prolonged periods is straight up dangerous. It might not be common but you can develop blood clots which can lead to fatal stroke by sitting stationary for too long, it can happen to you and no video game is worth your health. Get up and move around for at least a few minutes every couple hours. You cant get dragon cup if you're dead.

  
4) maintain your hygiene

This one is more for you significant other or roommates but its pretty easy to not shower change your clothes or brush your teeth if you're gaming all day every day, but being respectful to the people you live with will give you one less thing to worry about while you play, plus its just the right thing to do.

  
5) listen to your body

gaming 18 straight hours isn't something everyone can or should do. If the prolonged sessions are making you feel bad, listen to your body and take a break. The league is 8 weeks. you'll have plenty of time to play. Your health is always more important.

  
6) maintain your sleep

If you're normally working 9-5 and getting into bed by midnight you probably shouldn't deviate from that sleep schedule too much. We all will probably stay up a little later than normal to game on league start, but drastically altering your sleep schedule will make you feel tired and anxious the next day. Listen to your body and sleep when you're tired and try to sleep at the times you normally would.

 

That's my secret sauce for league starts. I hope y'all meet your goals and have a ton of fun in leagues 5!",0,1731197032.0,2007scape,16,0.37,False
1gnnpev,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1gnnpev/results_from_one_month_sugar_free/,Results from one month+ sugar free*,"Hey folks! I loved hearing about other people’s experiences when I first started this journey so I decided to share my own, after just over a month exploring my own no-added-sugar experience!

My own boundaries for sugar-free:
- no added sugar in *most forms - here and there I’ve ate something that was cooked with some store-bought chicken stock or accidentally had some ketchup with a meal, but I’ve intentionally avoided it as much as I am able
- no sugar without fibre ie. juices. whole fruits and veg only
- also, no alcohol and no coffee for the duration of the month. Tea okay, I drink plant-based milk that does have some sugar but it’s only a small amount that I use in my tea and I’m not willing to forgo my daily cuppa!
- still eat carbs - moved to wholewheat pasta, I eat sourdough bread, transitioning to more brown rice in the next month too. I’m very physically active generally and I also have a physically demanding job, so I need my energy. I’ve been more mindful about how much bread I consume.

Why I went sugar free:

I notice I use sugar to self soothe, reaching for it during stressful periods. Same with caffeine, hence cutting them both out for a month. I will crave chocolate/cake etc and it’s very habitual, like a bickie with tea etc. I wanted to explore what would happen - I’m v much a researcher, love to test my own limits (have done multiple months off coffee, a month of only cold showers etc). I’m also a bartender and I’m pretty good at restricting caffeine but that means on longer shifts I have a habit of bringing sugary snacks.

Overall, I used a sugar free month to practice mindfulness about my consumption habits & thought processes around food. It’s less about not having sugar, and more about being active and intentional with what I eat - building a habit of being more mindful around all of this!

The results:

I actually found it quite easy after the two weeks?! As soon as I realised a lot of my cravings were based in habit, it became easier to separate my feelings from the food. 

I started eating protein and fibre- rich breakfasts - before, I’d either have toast (with or without jam, maybe eggs) or Greek yoghurt with nuts and fruit. I never craved variety with my breakfasts. Since starting, I’ve been slamming the veggies - tons of greens! Sauerkraut, spinach, tomatoes, avocado, kale etc. 

Also, craving variety in my diet. I’ve been eating mainly toast (and sometimes yoghurt) for like… 4 years maybe. Very rarely changing. Same with meals - wanting something different but not necessarily craving something specific and new. In comparison - I had the BIGGEST craving for pancakes maybe 2 weeks in. I rarely eat pancakes and I’m not a big fan of overly sweet brekkies (says the person who likes jam on toast) so it was quite new. I’ve ended up spending the past few Sundays making myself pancakes with banana, Greek yoghurt and wholemeal flour in the batter and topping them with peanut butter, chia seeds and strawberries and it’s been AWESOME. Perfect level of natural sweetness, filling, not bloating, still gives me energy for work. I also had cravings for pasta - not usually a big pasta eater but on my period I was ravenous for a sausage pasta.

Snacking has been less, mainly nuts and dates and on my period I let myself get a 100% dark chocolate bar and it was really yummy !! I already like bitter things and fairly dark (70%ish) chocolate so after 3 weeks of no sugar, the 100% was a breeze. I have always been the biggest chocolate fiend, but since going sugar free I’ve mainly craved cake - something about the texture?

Using some advice on this sub, I slammed salt and fats at the start - powering through heavy cravings with a packet of chips or something. Definitely served its purpose, it helped me out of the sugar craving holes with sensory intensity and personally I find it way easier to avoid salty snacks than sugar, generally - now that I have less cravings I need less salt to avoid the cravings if that makes sense!!

I had some cake and wine this week to celebrate my partner’s birthday, which marked a month off sugar for me. I had some cake the first day,  but didn’t finish it. The next day was their bday and we had cake for brekkie and I DID slam that, hehe. And then the day after I had a coffee with oat milk with my brekkie. I had scope to buy snacks, chocolate, treats, anything I wanted. BUT! I didn’t. Other than what I’ve mentioned. I’ve come back to work the next day and WANT to carry on with the sugar free vibes. I like my life like this.

Anyway I’m eating my pancakes rn and they’re really yummy and I probably wouldn’t have made them if not for the sugar free month so that’s why i am writing this! This was my journey n I’m keen to see what else comes up with my mindful eating :)",3,1731197009.0,sugarfree,1,1.0,False

1gnndgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicofNE/comments/1gnndgk/my_opinion_on_the_feasiblity_of_new_english/,My opinion on the feasiblity of New English independence.,"The first issue with New England’s independence is that New Englanders aren’t really passionate about it in the first place. New England is one of the most wealthy regions in the United States. Typically people who are not undergoing crisis aren’t ones to have a sudden radical change in opinion (such as becoming a secession advocate). There is talk, as I’m sure you have seen, on the subreddit of secession. It’s a big uptick and it has to do with Trump’s election. While I’m positive this is 99% talk (and reaction’s to trump’s presidency are over blown, the people most disappointed with him always end up being his supporters) it gives you an idea of how political upheaval could drive secessionist sentiment. 

Two, the United States is the number one global super power. Assuming this global superpower is going to continue to exist, that means it is unlikely to want to let go of New England. New England is a very profitable region, and would be a noticeable blow to federal taxes. Empire’s seldom give up land for any reason, let alone goodness of their hearts. Historically if you look at the decolonization of Africa, it wasn’t just people going “We need to stop oppressing Africans because it’s immoral!” It was the fact that the colonial sector had become totally unprofitable. I honestly imagine that an independent New England would have to come about from a guerrilla war. (The point of a guerrilla war is not to win, rather, it is to make occupation unprofitable so the enemy pulls out.) 

Three, New Englanders are not particularly eager to die in a war. From what I have seen most posts on the subreddit, like previously mentioned, are upset people venting about the election. Which is fine, I don’t mind, but it lacks substance. If you saw my one comment, why do these people not just move to Canada? The want for New English independence has to be greater than one’s desire to live for their own life. It would be an immensely difficult path to achieve liberation, then an even greater struggle to make such a nation be able to stand on its own two feet. New England is very reliant on the rest of the United States for things like, manufactured goods, agriculture, and raw resources. With the extent of the global market these things won’t necessarily be hard to make up for, but it would consequently be very difficult for us to maintain our economic sovereignty and we could end up de facto being controlled by America anyways.

I'll try and keep this as easy to understand as possible because there's a lot of context 

My dad M65
My mum F62
Me M31
My brother M29 
My sister F25

We live in France. We moved as a family from the UK 20 years ago. To this day my dad doesn't speak french and has never really integrated here. 
My mum and dad are still married but that's about all you can say. They probably don't really ""love"" eachother anymore.

I run a business with my Dad. This business is split between the UK and France. My dad has always split his time between the two countries, but the last few months he has spent much more time in the UK. And when he is with me working in France, he seems agitated about getting back as soon as possible. My mum has also said that he seems distant when he is here. 
I seldom return to the UK, and I consider that branch of this business to be his domain so I am very disconnected from the happenings over there.
Recently I received a message from our secretary in the UK saying that she is leaving, but that she would like to talk to me about the reasons why.
I spoke to her on the phone for about 2hrs during which she told me about a woman (let's call her Sarah) who had begun a relationship with my dad. She is 33 and apparently a very bad influence. She has a severe drinking problem and is described as being manipulative. She does not work and is now living in one of the flats that my dad has in the UK. However according to her my dad's life now revolves entirely around her.
Both me and my mum have spoken to a couple of other people we know and trust who are around my dad and Sarah, and they all paint the same picture of her. One of them even said that she had seen Sarah slap my dad and throw coffee and wine on him (he laughed it off apparently). So I have heard many many stories from several different people, and not a single one of them good.
Right now it seems she is living off my dad and has even called him her sugar daddy.
My dad owns a few connected flats and a house/outbuildings etc on the same property with a number of tenants, many of whom have been there for several years and who he previously got on very well with. Since he has met Sarah, he has been evicting or even become menacing to any of the tenants who don't like Sarah (which seems to be everyone).
So he is doing everything to accommodate her and removing anyone who is against her. Our secretary left because she couldn't stand Sarah anymore, and also because she found cameras in her office that she suspected had been installed by Sarah.

I think my dad getting into a relationship was inevitable because of him not feeling at home in France, and also because my parents aren't really in love anymore. 

I am not close with my dad, and neither is my brother really. We never speak about anything other than work. Having a heart to heart is going to be very difficult. Indeed I regret perhaps not treating him with more kindness, because I think he is so entralled because he is getting ""affection"" that he never gets from us. My sister is the only one who could maybe get through to him.

1. I am worried about my Dad and how to get him away from this crazy woman. I am fine with him having another relationship, I think it's actually a good thing, but not with her!
2. I am not so worried about my mum because she has said that she is neither upset or angry. They both kind of checked out of the relationship a while ago.
3. I am worried about the financial risk of having someone like Sarah exerting huge influence on someone who is also my business partner. I feel I need to take steps to protect our assets from her. I have heard that my dad wants to install her as his new secretary (which would mean access to company accounts, credit cards etc)

My dad is coming to France next week. He doesn't know that we know. We will speak to him about Sarah. I then intend to fly over and meet her.

1gnn7f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/1gnn7f3/who_are_you/,Who are you?!?,"Hey sorry for my long post!

A little anecdote? So, I’m a project assistant manager at a general contractor, and I haven’t been in the role for very long. I love what I do, and I hope to become a project manager someday!

As an assistant, I don’t go on-site very often, but I love it when I get the chance! One of my first big projects was the decontamination and renovation of a school. After the decontamination phase, it was easier to visit the site and see the progress. We actually needed to go to take photos for the company’s social media.

So, the project manager and I head over to the site together. We had to meet the superintendent to catch up and discuss a few issues. There were about 50 people on-site daily, and not all the teams were getting along… One would complain about the other, and so on. Let’s just say, I’m very happy not to be the superintendent!

So, the three of us talked, and everything went fine. I told the other two, “I’ll go grab my coffee in the break room, and I’ll meet you upstairs.” I ended up alone.

To give some context, I’m a petite woman. I’m 27, but I don’t look my age at all—I easily pass for 16. I headed towards the stairs to join the others, and suddenly, someone called out to me, quite harshly: “Where are you going? What are you doing here? Who are you?” I turned around, and it was a man in his 40s, looking me up and down.

I had never been looked at like that in my life. It was as if he was mad at me. Suddenly, I couldn’t speak, and I started stammering. He repeated his questions, and his colleague standing next to him had a small grin, holding back a laugh.

I finally managed to introduce myself, but the guy questioning me didn’t really hear me. So he kept staring at me as if he wanted a confrontation. What did I do to make him so grumpy?? 😭

His colleague finally said, “Stop, stop—she’s with the general contractor.”

Out of everyone on the site, he was the only one who was hostile toward me. The others were smiling, greeting me kindly.

I was so uncomfortable that I even wondered, “Is he being racist or sexist?” His tone was so aggressive…

Since then, I’ve visited many other sites, and it’s been wonderful! On the contrary, the atmosphere on-site is usually pleasant, and I spend my time laughing! Even though I’m one of the only women… I don’t feel out of place.

Today, it doesn’t affect me anymore, but has anyone else had “similar” experiences? Women or men, it doesn’t matter...",0,1731195526.0,Construction,4,0.38,False

The Buzz on the Spin

  
  


  
  


After Hoagie had effectively wrangled back Zizzi he led them into Section Four proper and everyone immediately craned their necks upward. “In Octarin Spin, and stations of similar design, the gravity goes towards a central point. However, unlike many of them, in this central area, the hub of this wheel to use a visual, the gravity is shifted as if the wheel were laying flat and there’s a definitive up rather than a subjective one.”

  
  


“Is this going to be a common model?”

  
  


“The design is very old and the spinning of the station means that if the artificial gravity fails then the only place it will not work as it already does is in administration. As such, they are instantly aware if something has gone wrong with the artificial gravity which is tied into many, many other important systems.”

  
  


“Meaning it’s a tripwire in case something else is down.”

  
  


“Correct. If things start floating it’s time to get moving.”

  
  


“Does it happen often?”

  
  


“About once a week my coffee starts escaping it’s mug without my aid.” Hoagie answers. “Now, there are roughly four levels to each section with Admin above all of it. We’re in the Main Commercial area. We just left the Docking Ring, above us is the Bio levels and Production Levels. Bio Levels helps with life support and supplying raw materials for the station like the oils for rubber and additional foods. Industry varies from section to section and is often woven into the Commercial area. In this case? Food, lots and lots of good food on the cheap, but not expensive foods. Grain enough to drown in, enough leafy greens to paint a jungle, fruits by the kiloton and so much in the way of veggies that you can haunt the nightmares of all the children of Earth simultaneously.”

  
  


“And meats?”

  
  


“The Vulbaa...” Hoagie starts to say and Zizzi is growling. “Calm down girl.”

  
  


“Why is she so...” Observer Wu begins to ask.

  
  


“Generational Trauma. The Charbis Homeworld is NOT kind, or rather, was not kind to the Charbis. Meanwhile the Vulbaa were blessed to migrate into a much more peaceful area when their shared ancestor was undergoing initial migrations.”

  
  


“I see...” Observer Wu notes as Hoagie keeps Zizzi from taking control of her laser again.

  
  


“Calm down Zizzi, he’s not an enemy.”

  
  


“Him being here means he thinks you’re a liar, traitor and worse! It’s an insult!” She protests.

  
  


“No it’s not. Calm yourself.” He says pulling her out of the air and hugging her gently. She looks like a toy in his arms.

  
  


“He might take you away!”

  
  


“No I do not have that power. I am simply an Observer. When I return to Earth everything I describe as having witnessed and all evidence and knowledge I gather will be regarded as truthful regardless of how absurd, unusual or improbable it might be.” Observer Wu says and she glares at him.

  
  


“I still don’t like you.”

  
  


“Unless it’s allowed in the hive you hate everything by default. That’s not much of a declaration Zizzi.” Hoagie says in a calm tone. “How about we go to my mothers Diner? You’ve at least passingly met her before Observer Wu and a place built to more human sensibilities would likely be a bit of a relief. Hivers is more to the sensibilities of shorter races like the Charbis.”

  
  


“That sounds lovely, lead the way.”

  
  


“It’s a bit of a way so we’re going to a lift. She’s right at the edge of where the Hives start.”

  
  


“As we go, could you tell me what that’s like?”

  
  


“A Charbis Hive is an extremely well fortified and defended family home. It’s also intensely private and a complete betrayal to give even the smallest details about it to one not already invited in. So I cannot tell you more beyond the immediately and extremely obvious. Which includes the fact that they’re very well defended, very comfortable and very well maintained.” Hoagie says.

  
  


“I see. And your family situation?”

  
  


“I am the Hive Husband. The women of the hive are my wives and the children of the hive are mine. The nearby hives are either sister hives or the mother hive to Beezerkers. One day there will be daughter hives. Is this understood?”

  
  


“It is. Thank you.” Observer Wu states as they enter the lift. “Is it possible to earn the right to enter a Hive?”

  
  


“It requires absolute trust. The kind of trust that normally goes only to close family.”

  
  


“So your mother is permitted into the Hive?” Observer Wu asks.

  
  


“Correct. But only Beezerkers. I have a semi-invite to the other hives.”

  
  


“Meaning?”  
  
  


“I will not be turned away or attacked on approach. They will let me speak and I will be potentially allowed inside under armed escort. This is a rare event among Hives however. Many go their entire lives without playing host or being hosted in such a way.”

  
  


“I see, very interesting. Any advise for dealing with the Charbis then?”

  
  


“Respectful distances and do not respond to their insults. They’re very reasonable but very defensive.” Hoagie says as the lift reaches the proper level.

  
  


He then leads them out of the lift and to the immediate left. A simple sign proclaims the glass walled restaurant is Janet’s Joint where a young woman in a bouncy pale pink waitress outfit and an apron overtop is having a lively conversation with a grey skinned alien woman who’s picking at her own waitress outfit as if unsure.

  
  


“She did it again...” Zizzi mutters.

  
  


“Yep.” Hoagie replies.

  
  


“... She’s kinda scary, she keeps doing this!”

  
  


“That’s mom for ya, she has no enemies.” Hoagie says fondly.

  
  


“How’d you become so good at fighting with your mom making the fucking Vulbaa look like Cannidors?” Zizzi demands.

  
  


“I blame my dad, and the two years of insane training back on Earth. Being a complete shit of a kid also contributed.” Hoagie remarks before his communicator goes off and he answers it in an instant. “Eastman.”

  
  


There is a pause and he sighs. “I’ll be there shortly. I need to square away Observer Wu so he can get his bearings and start poking around. If some more people could spend their break at my mom’s Diner it would make things easier on him and likely everyone.”

  
  


He smirks. “Yes, I’m aware that it also helps my mother. What do you think I am stupid?”

  
  


“That was rhetorical. Anyways, I’ll be on my way shortly. Thank you for letting me know.” He finishes the call and turns to Observer Wu. “Sorry to say but I need to leave shortly. There’s someone trying to start something stupid in sector five and they want me to show up from behind in what is looking like a hostage situation.”

  
  


“What’s going on?”

  
  


“No idea, I’ll get you sitting down comfy and safe and then I’m going to make some idiots decidedly unsafe.” Hoagie says as he holds Zizzi out a bit and tosses her up a touch. She starts flying immediately and buzzes away to talk to her sisters about something. He then leads them at a fast clip into the Diner.

  
  


“Hello mother! Sorry I can’t stay someone’s being a dummy in the next Sector and I’m sure you know Observer Wu and what he’s here for. Love you! Bye!” He says giving her a quick hug and then rushing out and then sprinting to the edge of the platform and leaping hard.

  
  


“The problem with being in charge of so much...” Janet says fondly. “Anyways! Welcome to my Diner! I have foods from Earth and a substitutes that are nearly identical in taste. All locally grown, freshly sourced, reasonably priced and hand cooked! How can I start you all off?”

  
  


“A coffee to begin with, some cream and sugar on the side so I can fill the rest in myself.”

  
  


“Certainly. We have whipped cream too...”

  
  


“Oh! Maybe next time. I’m afraid I need to speak business, although I would like to speak with you a touch. About the things you’ve seen in the... oh my... couple of months since you were on The Inevitable.”

  
  


“Certainly, and what about everyone else? My new waitress is very fresh to the job so please, go easy on her. Please?”

He exits out the maintenance hallway and crouches low. A focus of energy to the top of his head and a tiny piece of khutha embedded in his skull activates.

As he does so he hears shouting, swearing and there is a scream of fright. Distinct from a scream of pain, so it just means that someone is being stupid and not hurting others yet. But things are escalating in a HURRY.

  
  


“... and if not then miss Heiress gets her head blown clean off!” A woman is screaming as he slips out the door and into the compromised hotel lobby. The entrances to the rooms and main entrance were covered, but no one was looking to the unobtrusive maintenance hallway with the unlisted and unsigned door between two art pieces. Pieces that Hoagie is ninety to ninety five percent sure are fakes, but he can’t rule it out that someone stole the originals and stashed them here.

  
  


He moves fast, he’s not going to be unseen for long as he draws out his lucky luger and quickly has it pressed up against the back of the hostage taker’s head with his banger pointed back to the rest.

  
  


“Let the hostage go or YOUR head gets blown clean off.” He says and everything pauses. “You have three seconds. One. Two. Thr...”

  
  


She twists to try and throw him back and his shot deflects off the now Axiom reinforced head of the woman. He full body tackles her and carries her, the hostage and himself out of the hotel lobby. He grabs around the criminal and jumps back to separate her from the hostage. They turn on the ground for a moment and he ends up with her pinned under him with his banger held to her collarbone.

Her jaw drops under her disguise in the crowd. Was this one of the humans on the station? He had simply emerged from a doorway that blended into the opulent lobby and then crashed through the scene, freeing a hostage and taking one of the criminals hostage in a single reckless, swift and bold movement.

  
  


After he wins his wrestling match with the Tret woman his helmet and cloak are called back into an Axiom pocket somewhere on his person and he’s revealed to be a man with prominent facial hair and a very bright and distinctive shirt. She records and simply observes as the individual wrestles the hostage taker upright and uses her as a hostage to force the others to hesitate. Which is all the time needed for Cannidors in red patterned armour to launch some kind of grappling cables at the remaining women and literally reel them in.

  
  


It’s over. It’s already over. A good chance to see how exactly these less than legal areas deal with outright crime and it’s over in ten minutes. And most of that was waiting for the strange human to crash in out of nowhere. She slips away from the crowd before activating a communication device she’s had implanted into her jaw.

  
  


“Human identified as Daniel Eastman arrived with previously unknown helmet and cloak configuration as additional armour to his already understood low profile equipment. Confirm status update to persons of interest.” She says to her opposite still on the ship. “Returning to scouting for appropriate area for potential long term observation.”

  
  


As she finishes her report she fails to notice an entity above her. Not that it’s fair to blame her for such. The creature in question has no physical presence, is not interfering with airflow or photons of any sort. Invisible, inaudible, leaving no scent and leaving no impact the super predator follows the infiltrator in amusement. Then suddenly pauses and then rushes away. Undetected the entire time.

Above a crib a suddenly fussy baby is gently picked up and kissed by a gigantic black creature. Next to it is a newly laid egg in a sealed and properly maintained incubator chamber. “There there little one. It’s okay. Mommy is here.”

  
  


It had taken a little for the tiny bundle of joy to adapt to her. Being tube born was hard even in ways that weren’t normally considered. Without being born of one of her eggs the poor little dear hadn’t been able to tell that she was mommy. It had taken a little. But it had been so worth it. Tony, soft and hot hands reach over her head crest and leave trails of colours in the heat as he traces all kinds of patterns over her. She gives her little baby boy a kiss and he giggles before the sound of her communicator rings out and she answers it with one of her free hands. She looks at the sender.

  
  


“Oh! It’s your tube brother. Although from my understanding you’re technically older than him! A whole week! Isn’t that silly? Isn’t that just so silly the way life works at times?” She asks the happy gurgling little guy. The bits of happiness from the baby is all the answer she needs before answering. “Hello little Harold, I hear you’ve been having a time of it!”

  
  


“I have! I’ve gotten into all kinds of fight, all sorts of medical procedures and all new worlds. Speaking of, I’m on station. Do you have time for a visit or are you just about to leave for another trip?”

  
  


“Oh no, I’m going to be grounded for a bit. Two new babies to take care of. Both relatives of yours.”

  
  


“Really? I guess I have to visit then.” Harold states.

  
  


“You do. Anything I should be prepared for?”

  
  


“Yes, I have wives now...”

  
  


“Oh you just grew up so fast!”

  
  


“Anyways, prepare for not just me, but a Great Desert Nagasha, a Metak, a Seramali and a Takra-Takra.”

  
  


“Oh! A colourful bunch, what connects them?”

  
  


“Larkan and the Primals surrounding it. Thassalia is the ancestress of Giria my first wife, and she introduced me to Javra, Dumiah and Umah. Warriors all.”

  
  


“Well, this is going to be fun. See you soon. Oh and one more thing, there’s some very sneaky little ladies on the station. Very long necks with hoods or frills on them.”

  
  


“Primal like Axiom markings along these frills?”

  
  


“Yes, interesting isn’t it?”

  
  


“It IS, I spotted one on the last planet I was on... I think I’ve been followed.”

●      **Get a Hutch for Your Desk**: Raise your monitors if you don't want to deal with mounted arms. I have a corner standing desk with a hutch setup and four 27-inch monitors beautifully arranged.

●      **Personal and Work Laptops**: You should have a personal laptop and your work laptop. Never ever rely on your work laptop as personal. **Ever**. Use the work one for whatever, but keep all your personal files separately clouded.

●      **Snack Smart**: Keep a stash of Planters Deluxe Mixed Nuts—cashews, almonds, Brazil nuts, pecans, and pistachios—so you don't eat yourself into overfat.

●      **Wallet Within Reach**: Keep your wallet nearby so you can impulse purchase things that you need. Trust me on this.

●      **A Real Clock**: Have a clock—a real physical device that sits on your desk, plugged in, solely for always having the time of day in your face. Not your calendar, not your phone, not your laptop or watch's clock. **Do this thing**.

●      **Notebooks Galore**: You should have a day-to-day random notebook, a work notebook, and a **""we're making it out the hood with this one""** notebook—that's for the sole purpose of putting in a same-day notice and leaving your team stranded one day.

●      **Stock Up on Cables**: You need at least 20—or one or two, respectively—of each of the following: HDMI cables, USB-C to USB cables, USB to Lightning cables, an extra universal PC laptop charger, micro USB to USB cables, Ethernet CAT12 cables.

●      **Essential Accessories**: You need clamps for holding things, prescription UV-layer screen-ray blocking coated glasses, an iPad or 'Sidecar' companion device, monitor lights, Pilot G-2 07 pens, a YETI coffee mug, YouTube Premium subscription, Audible subscription, and a J5 Create multi-plug thing.

1gnn0m2,https://i.redd.it/x04a9i5hnyzd1.jpeg,Normally social senior cat hiding since Tuesday night ,"Hey all, hoping to get some reassurance here. I apologize for the length of this post, tl;dr my 11 year old cat is healthy as far as I/his vet can tell but he’s been hiding since tuesday night and i can’t tell if he’s just THAT pissed we took him to the vet or getting ready to pass away.

Photo for tax from last week when he was acting like himself

On Tuesday night, we were clipping my senior (~11 years old) cat’s nails. He was getting upset so we let him go, and as he jumped off the couch and ran under the coffee table he started hissing and yowling. At no point was he held tightly or restrained past being gently held in place. He tried to run under the bed, got tangled in a phone cord, and then ran to hide in the bathroom. When he hadn’t come out a few hours later I went to offer him some treats and lure him out. He took about two steps, made a really angry yowling sound i’ve never heard him make before, and almost immediately squatted and had a bowel movement. He then laid down next to it and refused to move. I thought maybe he was in so much pain he pooped himself so immediately took him to the emergency vet. They said he was stable but seemed uncomfortable and sent us to the waiting room. After a few hours around 3AM we decided to just take him home and bring him to his regular vet when they opened. 

The vet examined him and said he looks good but seemed to have some soreness in his leg/chest- sometimes he hissed when touched other times he had no reaction. They said it’s extremely unlikely he has any kind of serious injury to the leg because he is putting weight on it but was possibly limping slightly. They checked his blood work (completely normal) and urine (also normal). He has a history of crystals in his urine (once, about two years ago) but is using the litter box normally and nothing was found in his urine. We were sent home with 3 days of pain meds (Onsior). 

Since then, he acts terrified to come out of the bathroom. I set up a litter box and his water fountain and he’s using both normally. He came out to eat the last two days but immediately scurries back in. He’s normally pretty social and will follow me around, come up to me for cuddles, and is very talkative but he’s done none of those things since Tuesday afternoon. He purrs when I go in there to pet him, is eating, drinking and using the litter box normally, and will even play a little bit if I bring the toy to him in the bathroom. I’m hoping he’s just incredibly dramatic and mad we cut his nails and then took him to two different vets. I don’t feel like 11 is that old for an otherwise healthy cat but it’s been long enough that i’m starting to worry he may be getting ready to pass.. I know no one can give me a definitive answer but any reassurance my boy will be ok or advice for how to get him back to his normal self would be deeply appreciated ",1,1731194972.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

1gnmy3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConstructionManagers/comments/1gnmy3n/who_are_you/,Who are you??,"Hey everyone, sorry for my long post!

A little anecdote? So, I’m a project assistant manager at a general contractor, and I haven’t been in the role for very long. I love what I do, and I hope to become a project manager someday!

As an assistant, I don’t go on-site very often, but I love it when I get the chance! One of my first big projects was the decontamination and renovation of a school. After the decontamination phase, it was easier to visit the site and see the progress. We actually needed to go to take photos for the company’s social media.

So, the project manager and I head over to the site together. We had to meet the superintendent to catch up and discuss a few issues. There were about 50 people on-site daily, and not all the teams were getting along… One would complain about the other, and so on. Let’s just say, I’m very happy not to be the superintendent!

So, the three of us talked, and everything went fine. I told the other two, “I’ll go grab my coffee in the break room, and I’ll meet you upstairs.” I ended up alone.

To give some context, I’m a petite woman. I’m 27, but I don’t look my age at all—I easily pass for 16. I headed towards the stairs to join the others, and suddenly, someone called out to me, quite harshly: “Where are you going? What are you doing here? Who are you?” I turned around, and it was a man in his 40s, looking me up and down.

I had never been looked at like that in my life. It was as if he was mad at me. Suddenly, I couldn’t speak, and I started stammering. He repeated his questions, and his colleague standing next to him had a small grin, holding back a laugh.

I finally managed to introduce myself, but the guy questioning me didn’t really hear me. So he kept staring at me as if he wanted a confrontation. What did I do to make him so grumpy?? 😭

His colleague finally said, “Stop, stop—she’s with the general contractor.”

Out of everyone on the site, he was the only one who was hostile toward me. The others were smiling, greeting me kindly.

I was so uncomfortable that I even wondered, “Is he being racist or sexist?” His tone was so aggressive…

Since then, I’ve visited many other sites, and it’s been wonderful! On the contrary, the atmosphere on-site is usually pleasant, and I spend my time laughing! Even though I’m one of the only women… I don’t feel out of place.

Today, it doesn’t affect me anymore, but has anyone else had “similar” experiences? Women or men, it doesn’t matter.

**This is not a full solution** (yet?) as i've only completed a part of this ARG, but i'm opening this post for discussions and futher cooperation (unless some madman goes through all of this in 2 days and 69 coffee cups). If you have any progress, feel free to show it in the comments or my Reddit DMs / Discord (apszoldat, DMs open).

! ARG spoilers ahead !

(actually i don't know what can be spoiled from the level itself, but go play it first if you haven't, it's **cool**)

The very first frame of level's starting animation contains a QR code leading to this ARG's entry point: [bit.ly/3Trd036](http://bit.ly/3Trd036)  ( [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WHKdVu7AP3eFRvOSHszErFgEJ1Or2KLT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WHKdVu7AP3eFRvOSHszErFgEJ1Or2KLT) )

There you can find a welcoming text which leads you to talking with NPC in 4th world, Solstice, which says the following lines: >! Ivrj rqvgbe, qba'g trg qvfgenprgrq. Nsgrejneqf, gel 'Guerr-NRCWRd !<

This is a text encrypted using >!Caesar's cipher!<, commonly used in this kind of ARGs. Decrypted text: >! View editor, don't get distraceted. Afterwards, try 'Three-AEPJEq !<. We'll try using this text in a link instead of QR code's one and get this: >! [bit.ly/3AEPJEq](http://bit.ly/3AEPJEq) !< (>!

Now we can see 3 important pictures. One of them, Operator's Guide, is a part of directly getting the coin, while Hear Between The Worlds (HBTW) and The Cross-Dimensional Machine (TCDM) are required to advance in ARG.

HBTW is 9 drawings of level's locations. We need to match these locations with level's songs names in order: >!Skydiver, Heartburn, Infinite Frontier, Night time, Yesterday, Clear sky, Ocean, Idyllic, New Dawn!<. First letters of these names form >!SHINYCOIN!<.

In TCDM we need to fill 6 names of level's locations and the spaceship's name by their backgrounds, and numbered letters will make up the word >!TINYURL!<

Idk what to explain here, it's pretty straightforward: >! [tinyurl.com/SHINYCOIN](http://tinyurl.com/SHINYCOIN) !< ( >! [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PvwPJNP5P6tdS8C2GM6L8IlBpYJZXcztBGSI17vW0mk](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PvwPJNP5P6tdS8C2GM6L8IlBpYJZXcztBGSI17vW0mk) !< )

This document contains explanation of Galofuf's level trilogy and next puzzle. We see a seqence of numbers, and highlighted letters in the phrase above say: ""A TO Z"", so these numbers are the numbers of letters in english alphabet. By converting this manually or, for example, through a simple python script we get the following text:

>!SIUNITFORCURRENT!<

>!HOMERWHATSIMPSON!<

>!HUNDREDINROMANNUMS!<

>!EARTHSNINEPOINTEIGHT!<

>!SHAPEOFADONUTORCD!<

>!POPULARMCQANSWER!<

>!MAJORKEYNOSHARPS!<

So, this is where my solo attempts of solving this stop yet. My answer for this series of riddles is: >!Amper, Jay, C, G, Disk, A, C!<. Document says we need to find some sort of ID tied with it, so i suppose we need to do something with the first letters of these words: >!AJCGDAC!<.

1gnmsr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gnmsr4/the_mad_hatter_blog/,The Mad Hatter Blog,"Starting a personal blog today.  I was a bit hesitant.  I know the law isn’t on my side here, but I feel like I have to tell someone.  The onsite psychologist told me that it helps to write things down, so let the therapy begin.  

A bit of background.  So, I’m working at a research lab for NeuroInnovations in Human Medicine that’s been trying to fit prosthetics using brain implants.  It’s basic research so we’ve been working with animals.  The work was all pretty standard until last week when I tried a new technique.  

Let's back up.  The company was failing pretty spectacularly.  It was a pet project of a Billionaire tech mogul who was now fighting bankruptcy.  The work itself was cutting edge, but risky; the kind of risk that invited lawsuits.  Bottom line, I got my notice last week.  It wasn’t a pink slip.  Nope, they did it the usual way where you just stop getting paychecks.  There’s an ongoing bet that we’ll find the doors locked inside of 2 weeks.  Sucks too, because I liked my job.

The job was like your standard biotech.  Except we took a few more risks.  My job was connecting sensors to the brain of a rat.  The goal was to use that direct connection to control prosthetics.  Not the altruistic kind, the military kind.  The thing is, the brain generally doesn’t like being poked and prodded, so instead of responding, the tissue instead tries to defend itself and essentially builds a scab around the sensor.  It then diverts signals from that portion of the brain so as to avoid pointier, prodding, sensors.  Brains are smart like that.  This results in a sensor that more or less becomes useless before a subject can even train to use it.  The company had tried to develop bigger sensors, but that’s like trying to create a Monet with a paint roller.  Drugs are sometimes used to trick the brain into acceptance, but that inevitably leads to a variety of other issues.  I once caught my boss saying this company was designed to fail.  I guess he was right.

Most people said fuck it and just left when they didn’t get their last paycheck.  So, the lab’s a ghost town.  I thought about leaving too, but this was my chance to use all the cool lab space for my own ideas.  The ones I begged them to try.  Of course they said no.  They always say no.  HR said it makes people “uncomfortable” and asked me to stop making suggestions.  So I did, but not any more!  I could feel it.  This was my moment.

Instead of trying to fit sensors to the brain, I did some research and found this awesome paper about how to grow artificial skin in a lab.  The shit you can find on the internet is astounding.  Anyway, we got this amazing state-of-the-art 3D printer, and now no-one was using it.  It was designed to layer chemical compounds for tailored drug designs.  However, it didn’t take me too long to retrofit it for bio-chemical compounds.  Just took a few days before I had a prototype too.  

First, I created artificial brain tissue.  To activate it, I needed a food source.  I tried a few things.  Sugar works, but it also kills the tissue after a while.  Coffee makes everything go insane.  After trying a few more things, I found the secret sauce.  It turned out that what it likes most is what we all like most, bacon fat.  It really is brain food, who knew.

I then modified the tissue to produce a layer for a bio-neural-network.  The network layer consisted of a thin film of interconnected neurons.  I almost immediately figured out that simply by activating it, you could create stronger and weaker bonds; but that took time which I didn’t have.  Training this thing would be out of the question.

Maybe I could shortcut the training.  I needed to get weight and bias measurements.  I’m lazy so I designed the network using a computer.  I stole liberally from open source, but the process still took most of the rest of the week.  I had to redesign the network like 50 times to get it right.  I trained the network by connecting rat brain signals to a simulation of the prosthetic, using the network to understand and activate motion processes.  Once I began seeing results, I turned my attention towards architecting a biological network.  For a single layer, I spaced the tissue based neurons in accordance with the bias and fed each neuron so that its strength was proportional to the trained values.  Then, I layered the tissue, one over another so that the network's base layer would interface with the brain and the top layer interacted with the sensor.  I built the neurons to expect a particular signal, so I was able to hook ultra tiny wires to those pathways alone.  I’d hoped that this would prevent the neuron from scabbing and failing in the way that so many other tests had.  Next came the moment of truth.

The rat I chose for this experiment was way more rambunctious before the surgery.  Now, it just lay there.  The prosthetic was even less erratic than one driven by the standard sensors.  I didn’t want to give up, so I tried it a bunch more times with different configurations.  It all went quicker than I expected and before I knew it, the week was over.  I hadn’t thought about it until then, but it suddenly dawned on me that on the coming Monday, they’d probably euthanize all the animals.  I felt bad leaving that evening.  I wanted to take them with me, but my hands were full.  They weren’t going to pay me, so I took my compensation.  That printer was heavy, but I got it into the car all the same.

To my surprise, the doors weren’t locked shut on Monday.  In fact, they were broken wide open.  A fire the previous evening had somehow broken out and the entire lab was cinders.  We had cameras, but the company had stopped paying the service fee.  Everyone that showed up assumed that the owner started the fire to collect on the insurance.  I thought so too.  We mulled around talking for a bit when I overheard the fireman say that the fire had started in an animal pen on the 3rd floor, my floor.  That was odd.  There’s plenty of easier places to start a fire in the lab.

Sitting here, preparing to restart my experiments, I know it’s not my fault, but I do sometimes wonder what might have happened to the rats of NIHM.",2,1731194334.0,HFY,2,0.75,False

It's to a point that I have to plan things around for when I wanna play rimworld. I love this game, but it feels that when I need to wait 20 minutes before I can play, it takes the wind out of my sails quite a bit. If people could be so kind as to tell me where they would cute from the list below? I mostly have the VxE mods, some of the Alpha mods, and CE, mainly mods that I feel like fit into the vanilla game relatively well like EPOE or Giddy up. If there are any mods you know of that bloat load times by a lot, or are redundant from the list, I would be very interested in hearing it so I can get back to playing this game we all enjoy playing. 

  
PS: Yes I have the game loaded on my SSD and have a pretty good PC; Ryzen 5 5th gen, 64 gigs ram, and a 3080,

I’m pretty new to the coffee machine game and recently got myself a DeLonghi Eletta. I’ve set it to the standard long coffee mode and am using Grind UK beans. However, the coffee keeps coming out sour/acidic, and I’m not sure why.

Is this a machine issue, or could it be the beans? I’m trying to figure out if it’s the grind size, the water temperature, or something else entirely. I’d love any tips on how to make the coffee taste smoother and less sharp. Open to experimenting with settings or trying different beans if needed.

Thanks for any advice – really appreciate it!",1,1731193851.0,DeLonghi,1,1.0,False

19 July 2023

The day I was diagnosed with Lumbar Radiculopathy at L4-L5 and L5-S1, and Retrolisthesis of L5 over S1, Grade 1. I was admitted to this prestigious hospital due to severe lower back pain. The treatment plan was rehabilitation and regular physical therapy sessions.

31 July 2023

The day I met the person I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. As I waited for my assigned PT—physical therapist—a sweet voice suddenly called out, ""Miss Sky Blue?"" I don’t know why, but I began to like the sound of my name when he said it. When I got home, I posted on Twitter about how cute my PT was. It felt like high school all over again, having a huge crush on someone I thought I had no chance with.

My sessions were regular, so I got to see him 3 times a week for 24 sessions.

As I became his regular patient, our friendship grew; we could comfortably talk and laugh during my sessions.

One time, I vividly remember asking him, “Hey! I’m kind of tired of dragging myself here to rehab. What if I ghost you and stop coming for PT sessions?” He professionally replied, “You’d have to consult your Doctor, the Physiatrist, so he can discharge you, but it’s really up to you.”

Minutes later…

He asked for my Instagram account, and I gave it to him.

I continued attending sessions, though less than three times a week. I felt hopeless, thinking my condition wouldn’t improve.

Even after following each other on Instagram, we still didn’t communicate outside of rehab, which I understood. He was protecting his job, especially since there were work ethics to follow.

That is, until I stopped going to rehab for PT sessions.

20 August 2023

He asked me out to get ramen with him. We went to a mall uptown, had ramen, small talk, coffee… until we decided to do something crazy. He booked a hotel room downtown. Nothing really happened that night; we cuddled and talked until we decided to go home.

We didn’t meet outside rehab after that.

Days later, I went back to rehab for some sessions, though not three times a week anymore, until I officially stopped treatment.

Though we were connected on Instagram, we still didn’t communicate.

Sometimes, he sent reels, and I sent reels back. It was like we were in a ""Reelationship,"" haha! Kidding aside, our lives went on. He was already talking to someone, and I was just busy with work. But he kept sending reels.

He wanted to meet up with the other person, but when they were about to schedule, she confessed that she was transgender.

He was upset. He called me. We talked. We decided to meet up.

Disclaimer: My PT is not homophobic. Transgender people are just not his preference.

28 October 2023

He was planning to reserve a room for us, saying he had a lot to tell me. However, something came up. I freaked out. I felt like our relationship was moving toward something serious. I made up some excuses, saying I couldn’t leave home because my dog would be left alone. He even suggested that I could just bring my dog.

We didn’t go to the hotel. Instead, I suggested we talk over coffee. We met, had fun, talked everything over coffee, and had a late-night walk around the business park.

2 November 2023

He asked me to have dinner with him. I freaked out but still went to see him. We had dinner and a late-night walk by the seaside.

8 December 2023

When we made it official. We took a little getaway trip to the south. We made love like there was no tomorrow, sang our hearts out in karaoke, walked, talked, laughed, and even extended our overnight trip into two nights. We were happy. We were in love.

1gnmjr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1gnmjr5/help_at_the_end_of_my_rope/,"Help, at the end of my rope ","First time posting and apologies it's going to be long. I'm really struggling and don't know what to do. My husband and I have been together for a total of 9 years and married for 7 of those. Over the course of these 9 years we have had repeated issues of him hiding porn and now emotionally cheating. I am at such a loss because other aspects of our relationship are great. He's a great dad and a good husband aside from these things.

A big issue is that with every single instance of catching him, it takes days/weeks to pull the whole truth out of him. He's a horrible liar and easy to tell when he is, but he's EXCELLENT at hiding and denying. So now every time something comes out, I can never believe he's truly telling it all. Because every other time I have had to pull the truth out of him piece by piece. Because of some of my past trauma, lying is a huge trigger for me. I can work through things and handle them as long as you are honest about it, no matter how bad it is.

The first signs/fights over hiding things involved excessive porn use. Once before we were married in 2016, once while we were going through infertility in 2018, and again when my daughter was a newborn in 2020. Ever since the first time I have told him how the porn was a nonnegotiable for me. It damaged my self esteem, my self worth, and it hurt like hell. He explained that to him the porn was his way to relieve stress and he had been addicted to it since he was very young.
He sought therapy and I really think he has finally overcome it since the 2020 incident. I haven't caught him since. I'm also admittedly, I chronic over-thinker.

Fast forward to now in 2024, our big issue is him hiding interactions, texts, and calls with a female coworker. He works as a probation officer  and his office location is next to all the other female officers. One of the females is much younger in age, has less experience as an officer, and is single. We will call her “C”. He had mentioned C to me before when talking about work in passing. I have even met C last year as I work in public education and she is assigned to come to our school to do safety checks once a week. I noticed towards May that she hadn’t been by but didn’t think much of it. In September we were sitting in the living room I asked to use his phone. I truly wasn’t looking for anything because I didn’t suspect anything. However I stumbled across that he had deleted a text from her that said “don’t ignore me”. 

I immediately got upset. I asked if he had deleted text with her and he admitted yes. I didn’t understand why. Over the course of days (as usual) he admitted that he and her had gotten a little too casual but nothing ever physical. I went through all other calls and text history and realized he had been in contact with her A LOT. Like 10x more than other coworkers. He claimed it was all work and just because they would rely on each others help (they aren’t partners). But if it’s just work then why hide it? And why would he want to rely on a small, young, less experienced female officer over the males or females with more experience? He said that the particular text made him realize that they were too casual. Then my mind is thinking…I wonder if she hasn’t been coming to the school because she doesn’t want to see me because something is going on between them.
I eventually dug more details out about him and her that do not happen with other coworkers:
-He has at times brought her coffee and her favorite soda.
-A few months ago someone was leaving post it notes on C’s desk saying hi. It became an office mystery of who was doing it/why. All the other female workers asked my husband if it was him. He said it was not and he went and talked to C about how he considered something like that playful flirty and that he would not do that because he was committed to his wife.
-He has told her things about our personal life like our previous issues with infertility with our first born and how we are going through it again now trying to have a second.
-She has spoken about her sex life and “being horny” in front of him. He said it was not directed at him but she openly talked about it while in his presence.
-She has asked him to come into work early because she needed his help immediately with someone being violent towards her…instead of just asking someone already in the office.
-He frequently complains to me about having to pick up the slack of other officers but never her. And based off of what I can see he is always drops everything to help her.

It’s like I had to piece all of this together for him to show that obviously there was some sort of connection with her that he didn’t have with others. And that if he has to hide it from me…then it’s because it’s inappropriate. He swore there was nothing physical and no blatant flirting. But I said this is it. I told him I was done with the constant lying, hiding, and not being open with me. He begged and pleaded for us to not separate. He promised he was going to be completely open and honest about everything. I asked that he tell her that he thought they were being too casual and needed to be more professional. He did have that conversation with her and she said she understood. I told him I didn’t want to nag him, or babysit him. I want to trust him. I know he still has to work and have interactions with her. I asked just that if he did tell me if anything happened to just tell me and that if they did have to go somewhere alone together to just tell me.

Things were good for 3 weeks. I didn’t even ask about her because I didn’t want to nag and I wanted to trust him. Then last Saturday I brought up not seeing her for months doing school security checks. He made A LOT of excuses for her and it brought up a red flag for me. I finally asked if anything has happened since the last fight about her. He said no. Then yet again, he finally admitted that last Wednesday and Thursday they went alone together to places on assignment. He admitted he didn’t like it and knew I would want to know. I could scream. IF ITS WORK THEN WHY NOT TELL ME?! At first he said that both times he was ordered by his chief but then admitted that the second time it was because she asked him. He complains about being behind on his own caseload and work but he so willingly drops things to help her? There are 11 other offices besides the 2 of them that she could go to for help. But no, she always goes to him and him to her.

I love him. I consider him my best friend. We were going through fertility treatments again to have a second child. I want to be with him. The last week I have warned him this is it. I’ve barely spoken to him. I’ve made us sleep in separate beds. He has cried and begged and signed up for therapy. He says he doesn’t tell me things because he doesn’t want to fight and is scared of loosing me. He also claims he thinks of these things as small and not necessary to tell me. 

I still feel like there is more…because there always has been before. How can I ever trust him? Why does he compulsively lie? I have explained over and over again if he is just upfront with me then I won’t get mad. What do I do? My mind is spinning, I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. It’s killing me not knowing if there is more. How can I ever believe him when he lies over small things? ",3,1731193619.0,Infidelity,6,1.0,False

Dreaming about gaining powers from aliens & being aware and in control,"Hi! I'm new here and have a question about a dream. I'm wondering if it was just a dream or astral projection.

On All Hallows' Eve I had a very vivid dream. I've been a vivid dreamer since childhood, but this one was exceptionally intense. It was incredibly detailed, and at times I had full control and was aware that I was dreaming (something I've experienced quite a few times before). I'll summarize:

The dream started with me at a job interview. At one point, I went to the bathroom, but it had a glass wall, so everyone could see me. It was super awkward and strange, almost like I was on display. Later, I went outside with one of the women who worked there. It was dark, and the sky was filled with a beautiful sea of stars, moving in waves as if it were breathing. I couldn’t take my eyes off it, and neither could the woman next to me. Suddenly, she was pulled into the sky in a way that felt like an alien abduction. I instinctively looked down at the ground, feeling that I needed to. I didn’t get pulled into the sky, but I gained a power: the ability to levitate.

As I levitated through the air, I saw a bright, full blood moon to my right and thought, It’s Halloween night. The feeling of levitation was familiar, I’ve dreamt of it before, and whenever I do, I feel fully in control and aware that I'm dreaming. Once I landed near a bonfire, I became some sort of ‘Eve’ figure, with long, thick hair covering my body. I felt like I was supposed to seduce a man who had also received a power from the aliens (he had a doppelganger). It felt like we were part of a plot and were meant to ‘breed’ to combine our powers, though we had no control over it. That part didn’t happen in the dream, though. It ended with us chasing each other through a labyrinth. I remember feeling a profound sense of being in love.

When I woke up, I felt completely drained. No amount of coffee or a shower could shake the exhaustion. My eyes were heavy, my head ached, and my joints and muscles felt weak like I hadn’t gotten any rest at all, as if I’d actually been somewhere else. Then, when I went outside to feed the chickens, I found one of them had mysteriously died, which felt really strange.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Any thoughts on what this might mean? Thanks!!",1,1731193577.0,Dreams,2,0.67,False

It was a messy breakup and pretty much my fault - excessive drinking, lack of effort, and came to a head when I would disappear for hours while she was working a long hour/stressful job.

We were living together for the last year and I ended up enrolling in a Masters program in another state. I coped with the breakup by doubling down on the drinking and getting on dating apps, and basically cut all contact for two months before moving out. Since then we've started talking here and there, and we met up for lunch and coffee about a month ago. Just seeing her and talking more, I've definitely started to develop feelings again and regret my actions (working through this in therapy since June thankfully). She broke down crying a few times during lunch and we hugged in her apartment for a bit, and she apologized if I felt like she pushed me away. Met for coffee the next day, kept it casual but unfortunately let the ""I've missed you"" out as I was leaving. She texted her after saying she was not ready for that conversation but it was nice seeing me and wanted to talk more going forward.

This was all a month ago or so, she left for a trip and said she realized it would be the first big trip she would be taking without me (didn't respond to that) and sent some pictures after. She's been reading a ton of romance books and we snap/text every so often but it's just a quick message here and there. While it's killing me to bottle up how I feel, I realize a relationship isn't really possible right now but I would give anything for that opportunity. She's an amazing person and still makes my heart race when i hear from her. I know its ""exes are exes for a reason"" but upon reflection and the space, I know I'm not the same person who left that relationship. I'll be back in the same city in 5-6 months, but I'm worried talking with her just comes off as desperate and the ex-bf who couldn't take a hint.

For those that were able to rekindle with an ex, how did you work towards a healthier relationship and realize that it was worth another try?

TLDR: Ex and I had a messy breakup but have been talking a little since. I still have strong feelings for her but am afraid of scaring her off by jumping into relationship talk.",1,1731193570.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

19 July 2023

The day I was diagnosed with Lumbar Radiculopathy at L4-L5 and L5-S1, and Retrolisthesis of L5 over S1, Grade 1. I was admitted to this prestigious hospital due to severe lower back pain. The treatment plan was rehabilitation and regular physical therapy sessions.

31 July 2023

The day I met the person I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. As I waited for my assigned PT—physical therapist—a sweet voice suddenly called out, ""Miss Sky Blue?"" I don’t know why, but I began to like the sound of my name when he said it. When I got home, I posted on Twitter about how cute my PT was. It felt like high school all over again, having a huge crush on someone I thought I had no chance with.

My sessions were regular, so I got to see him 3 times a week for 24 sessions.

As I became his regular patient, our friendship grew; we could comfortably talk and laugh during my sessions.

One time, I vividly remember asking him, “Hey! I’m kind of tired of dragging myself here to rehab. What if I ghost you and stop coming for PT sessions?” He professionally replied, “You’d have to consult your Doctor, the Physiatrist, so he can discharge you, but it’s really up to you.”

Minutes later…

He asked for my Instagram account, and I gave it to him.

I continued attending sessions, though less than three times a week. I felt hopeless, thinking my condition wouldn’t improve.

Even after following each other on Instagram, we still didn’t communicate outside of rehab, which I understood. He was protecting his job, especially since there were work ethics to follow.

That is, until I stopped going to rehab for PT sessions.

20 August 2023

He asked me out to get ramen with him. We went to a mall uptown, had ramen, small talk, coffee… until we decided to do something crazy. He booked a hotel room downtown. Nothing really happened that night; we cuddled and talked until we decided to go home.

We didn’t meet outside rehab after that.

Days later, I went back to rehab for some sessions, though not three times a week anymore, until I officially stopped treatment.

Though we were connected on Instagram, we still didn’t communicate.

I like to read. I read mostly books on philosophy, history, math, and anthropology.  I also like video games, jazz, anime and movies (mostly retro), tea and coffee, and spending time with my cat. 

I don't stress easily and am very easy going. I have a very very stoic face that makes me misunderstood but I promise I'm the most peaceful person you'll meet.

1gnmg4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1gnmg4f/a_question_about_timetracking_and_recording/,A question about time-tracking and recording working hours ,"Hello,

I'm a self employed freelance artist and work from home. 
Over the past two weeks I've moved from working an approximated 9-5 sort of set up to time-tracking and wracking up my weekly hours via Clockify.

In hindsight over the past fortnight I think I may have been quite pedantic with my time-tracking. As soon as I stop drawing or painting and lay my pen stylus down; say to check something not work related quickly on a browser, to take a wee break or grab a coffee, the time gets paused.  

I've found that during time-tracking, when wracking up 7 hours of work in a day I'm finishing late and into the evening. Then I consider what sort of day I'd have worked in an office job on a 9-5 and realise that I would naturally start work at 9, take a lunch break halfway through and by 5 I would finish for the day. I would also be taking lots of little screen breaks and allow myself a few small breaks for trips to the toilet and getting refreshments. None of that involved time-tracking and checking over how many hours I had worked and how many left until I could finish.

Does anyone else work like this with time-trackers? Or do you use the sensible approach and only pause during a lunch break? Should I probably just stick with time-blocking or something and use the old trusty 9-5 set up and finish on 5? Should I keep the time-tracking but be a bit more realistic with it?

I was chatting with my partner about it after it seemed like most days I'd clocking up 7 hours daily on the tracker but technically I'd be working more like 10-12 hours going by the actual time.

I'm new to this sort of productivity as before I guess I just used to 'eyeball' it time-wise. I think this new move comes from a desire to work more effectively and professionally with a satisfaction that I'm doing everything I can to the best of my abilities (given that I'm not accountable to anyone and am my own boss). 

So should I just carry on with my time-tracker but allow for stuff like screen breaks, coffee breaks, toilet breaks and other productivity tasks related to work including work admin and only really pause the tracker for my lunch break?

Thank you in advance for any input, personal insights and perspectives!",1,1731193320.0,productivity,2,1.0,False

**The first 18 months…**

Initially there will be a carrot and stick approach. Expect a show of force against his perceived enemies. This will be to scare us and keep us inline.

They will slow-roll their agenda. There will be some things done that you agree with. I would guess legalizing marijuana. The economy probably won’t crash at the beginning. And may even improve by his forced lowering interest rates. Don’t let these things make you complacent because the bad is coming.

There will be worrying things for the observant. My guess?  Nationalized school uniforms and curriculum. Most people won’t see the harm in these… they may even have broad support. But it also picks a fight with the trans community - because students will have to wear the uniform of their birth sex. Those who fight against this will take the brunt of the stick. You will hear people who consider themselves moderate say, “Well, they shouldn’t have broken the law” in solemn tones. 

During this time he will be placing loyalists in every facet of government. As a matter of fact, the best way for the average worker to have steady source of income during the coming bad times will be to pledge fidelity and get one of these jobs. If you choose this you won’t be able to change the system from the inside - you’d be lying to yourself -  you'd have joined him.

Expect the formation of a nationalized police force. This will give legal authority to the proud boy types. This will be what will first be used to round up “Illegals” and later used to suppress dissent.

The first camp will be built to detain “Illegals”. Later it will be used to house political dissidents - community organizers, politicians, college professors. Even later it will be used for what they call something like “undesirables.”



**The second 18 months…** 

The true bad times will start but again it will be a slow build up. 

A national school voucher system will starve public schools into irrelevance and feed money to churches. States rights won’t save them.

The first “Morality Laws” will be implemented during this time. Nationalized dress codes - again based on birth sex. The full revoking of abortion rights. Same sex marriages dissolved. 

The tariffs will crash the world economy. This is part of the plan. Tent towns and ghettos will form. They will be raided routinely by the new police force. Initially the raids will be supported by the ignorant populous - “Well, they shouldn’t be breaking the law” in solemn tones.

Any demonstrations will give him the justification he needs to start rounding up political prisoners. Expect well-know Dems to be jailed at this time.

Soviet style control of the internet will start. 

Ukraine and Taiwan fall (this may happen earlier actually). 

Book burnings start.

Cheap labor is now plentiful... because it’s you. You will take any job you can to feed yourself and your family. But you will be required to take the oath. This was planned from the start. You are now taking the jobs previously done by the now interned or deported “Illegals.” You may even take a job at a camp.

Social services will end. Previously retired elderly will work as servants in the homes of the rich. Many young women will be forced to prostitution. Many young men will be forced to join the army or gangs.



**The third 18 months…** 

Civilian loyalty pledges to him will be required. 

A government tracking app on your phone will be required. They have this in China already.

Facial recognition cameras will be installed on streets. They have this in China already.

Many more work camps will be built and non-believers sent to them.

The US will leave NATO.

To boost the country morale and economy, a war will be started. An orchestrated terrorist attack will justify his invasion of Canada or Mexico. It doesn’t matter which is first, they will both be invaded and conquered. 

An economy boosted by the war brings a relative calm.

Workers unions will be outlawed in the name of war.

Americas borders will be closed and you will not be allowed to leave the country - the rich need you to work till you die now.

Any remaining elected dissenters will be purged from the government. 

If he’s still alive, he will win a rigged election by 90 percent. If not his son will be installed as president. 

The rich get richer. We fight each other over the crumbs.



# WHAT TO DO:



Take out no credit and pay off all the credit you can. Weak financial footing will be how you become the first in the tent towns.

If you are in college. Take out no more student loans. Transfer to a community college if you have to. It’s better to drop out than take on debt. Only attend college if it is paid for fully. 

If you own a home, do not borrow against it. It will be worth nothing soon. 

Do not take out a loan for a car. If you owe on a car pay it off or sell it and buy one you can pay for as soon as possible. But you will need transportation. 

Buy nothing but essentials yet start prepping for the bad times. Prepper-ism was once the domain of the right. Now it it ours. You need extra supplies and food but not on credit.

Start building a reserve of essential medicine.

Ween yourself from all addictions now if you can. Even coffee.

To start preparations… keep a full tank of gas in your car and supplies to survive a few days. Build from there.

If you are permitted... buy and learn how to use a used gun. Don’t support their industry by buying new. Practice with it. Get good with it.

Take self-defense classes - especially women of childbearing age. Remember if you are raped you will be forced to give birth to the child. In a few years you may even forced into marriage with your rapist. Most likely your rapist will be a member of the nationalized police - and the courts will blame you for it. Become as good at getting away as you can. Remember they see rape as good. It creates another worker for them

Get in as good physical shape as possible. Can you walk for long distances? Can you sprint if need be? How much weight can you carry and for how long? But don’t get too skinny. You may need some fat reserves. If you need surgery - do it now.

Leave all social media. Only communicate by fully encrypted means. This will only be safe for now. Eventually encrypted communication will be outlawed. Use it while you can.

Preparation is your only focus and hobby now. 

Smile at work. Do not let them see fear. Do not let on that you don’t agree with them - this will buy you time later.",2,1731193214.0,TheSecondTerm,0,0.67,False
