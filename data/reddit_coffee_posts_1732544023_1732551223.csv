Im finding i am starting to get flare ups now the colder weather is drawing in. Ive had 2 bad episodes both in February (2022/23) arguably the coldest and last of the winter months in UK. Got so bad i could hardly pee it felt more like my muscles became too weak or i had been  paralysed down there.

I am now taking Quercitin, Pumpkin seed ev day. And started Pelvic floor workout from youtube on day3.

I had a Curry Alcohol and coffee Saturday/Sunday which left me with a delayed flareup Sunday night. It just seems the cold weather is making me more sensitive to coffee etc.  Anyone else noticed this they are worse in Winter/cold weather?

One other thing ive noticed is a dull twinge in my right pelvis area inside of my articular cartilage. I wonder if i had some sort of impingement or inflammation athritic which in the winter flares up and causes my issues.

My symptoms are sudden urge to pee (not always and not up at night )

Coffee makes it worse causes burning and urge.  
Alcohol can make the urge but not the burning.  
Sitting can cause discomfort standing seems to make me better.

My main annoyance is planning everything around when i may need a wee next :(

Ive stopped cycling which is really hard i love cycling :(  
And now i may have to stop lunges and HIT training because ive read if i have an impingement these exercises are bad for it.  
Should i see a Urologist or a PF therapist?",1,1732550776.0,Prostatitis,1,1.0,False

For King, art is a space of renewal, where creation transcends language, offering a glimpse into his world beyond words.

1gzm9ba,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gzm9ba,Off center fireplace,"I have been working to help my friend who is very overwhelmed. She has a very large living room. The couch that is on top of the rug is her new couch. So understand that their old couch is being moved out this week.  

They do not want to move their TV, but she hates how there is only a built-in on the left and it feels off balance for her. 

The part of the old couch that has the pillows piled on top of it is going to be an oversized leather chair. 

The portion of the living room next to the window will have two swivel rocker chairs with the small round coffee table, and a smaller rug to anchor the space. 

I believe she plans on getting an oval or rectangular coffee table for the new couch. 

We are going to cover the stone around the fireplace and she would like to paint the top inside part of the built-in a darker color. I don’t know if that would throw off trying to balance the fireplace and TV or if it would actually help. 

I think that maybe a feature on the wall behind the TV and to the right could balance things, but I am not sure. Open to any and all suggestions. ",1,1732550622.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

Hey r/Indiacoffee ! My girlfriend recently got me these two amazing coffees:
	1.	Bones Coffee Company - Colombia (Single Origin, Whole Bean, Medium Roast)
	•	Notes: Medium body, sweet and fruity with a touch of nuttiness.
	2.	Death Wish Coffee Co. - Vanilla (Ground Coffee, Rich & Creamy)
	•	Notes: A bold, flavored coffee with smooth vanilla tones.

I have some questions for anyone who’s tried these:
	1.	Have you tried either of these coffees? If so, which brewing method did you find worked best for them?

Now, here’s where I need some help:
	•	The Bones Coffee is whole bean, so I can grind it to whatever size I need.
	•	However, the Death Wish is pre-ground (my GF accidentally ordered the wrong version). I want to make the most of it—what would be the ideal brewing method for pre-ground coffee?

I currently have a French press, V60, Aeropress and C3 to grind. Would love to hear your recommendations!

1gzm3lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gzm3lq/mara_x_or_elizabeth_1000/,Mara X or Elizabeth? [1000€],"Hi all, 

I hate to have to ask of another comparison of these very similarly priced machines, but I hope to collect some information on the user experience, especially with the Mara X. 

I am considering the both the Mara X and the Elizabeth for my first machine. At this moment, the Bianca is out of reach. Is a dual boiler overkill for me, and would the Mara X work?

I would probably do espressos for most of the week, but want the flexibility for milk drinks over the weekend. I don’t host guests that often, perhaps 3-4 days out of the entire year, and I am the only coffee drinker in the household. If I do have guests, I would probably serve most of them French press instead of starting the espresso machine. 

For Mara X users:
- How do you handle the occasional 3-4 back to back milk drinks? What is your workflow like? 
- is the 3 position switch for brew temps sufficient to cover all roast levels? 

If I have understood correctly, the Mara X/V2 even on brew priority, kicks up the steam pressure in anticipation of the user steaming milk after pulling a shot. However, this then results in the brew water temps rising, albeit slowly, due to the mass of the group head. After approximately 5 minutes, the temperature creeps up, higher than what was set in the 3 position switch. Would a quick power cycle prevent the boiler from doing this? How long does it take for the boiler to return to the correct brewing temperature after this period of boosting the steam? The above information is detailed in a review by Dave Corbey.  

Being a dual boiler, the Elizabeth does not have any of the above quirks when dealing with multiple shots. However, I don’t do multiple shots all the time. While I don’t hate the looks of the Elizabeth, I am partial to how the Mara X looks, despite its known flaws. I also like that the Elizabeths’s manometer illuminates. The Elizabeth is on the wider side of what my kitchen can accept, while the narrow Mara X is a welcome aspect. I also think the LCC on the Elizabeth, and that I might miss it on the Mara X. Unfortunately, LCC and E61 is only on the Bianca. 

TLDR: Heart says Mara, Head says Lizzy. What do?",1,1732550243.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

A couple of weeks ago a guy reached out to me- he said he was attracted to the fact I was in scrubs and had a soft spot for nurses- we set up a coffee date and then near the time of the meeting he stopped responding. I was very confused. He missed it and I explained that it was disrespectful so to make it up to me- he said he was very busy with work and missed it and sent a VERY generous amount to make up for it. We arranged to meet for a drink the next day and really hit it off. He said I was stunningly beautiful in person- so impressed with how smart I was and seemed really committed to helping me as I was coming out of a nasty divorce, needed to find a place to live etc. We met for a real “date” shortly after- it went really well-said how I looked even better than he imagined (my body)- it all went so well. Now I know he works on Wall Street and has two kids- he is certainly a busy man and has in this short time not been super responsive- but I started to sense things were off. Like a couple nights we would send flirty texts. Then it just stopped. In terms of finding an apartment which is a huge deal in NYC he even offered to pay for a year up front (sadly no one here would accept that) but he was kind enough to help me with first months rent and security deposit. Coordinating to meetup for that was a bit hectic and then after (last Wednesday- it is now Monday) I said thanks so much and was asking if he needed some space since he wasn’t so responsive. This was all on my work phone. He said yes everything was ok just very busy. Cool no problem. He said over and over how he saw this being a long term thing- his last girl was 4 years- helped her with school etc. He was adamant we could knock out my massive student loan debt together too. He was so chill about money and generous and I was finally starting to feel worth it! Like yes I know a lot of men are really weird about money- it’s like prove your worth etc- and I know it seems nuts but I believed he was genuine. Sometimes people see you have a lot to offer the world- they have the means to help and they can. Anyway- this was all on my work phone then I left town to be with family THursday. I asked if he needed a break from me or if I should reach out with another number so we could plan further. I didn’t turn my phone back on until this morning as I was certainly feeling so sad and confused over this. Not only did he not respond but he blocked me! I am so hurt and I texted from my personal number to just say please give me the respect to tell me what is going on I just wanted to plan with you. I know he was a little concerned with my schedule but I said I would even meet him halfway and see about part time/ per diem to better meet his needs. I felt like FINALLY I found someone amazing! It took years in NYC but I found him! I am honestly shocked. The old me would have went straight to “I’m not attractive enough- he found someone else-” but I know that can’t be true because he was clearly very into me. What do I do? This is heartbreaking. And like I’ve just been kicked down so much recently it’s a lot to handle- obviously being an SB comes with risks and rejection but what the actual f&%k.

I'm currently using a Delonghi Dedica and Kingrinder K6. Lately I've noticed that the extraction seems a bit ""foamy"", as in the tail seems to come out of a bigger blob in the center of my basket (see video). The basket and portafilter are kinda mid, but can't afford to get some fancier ones for now. However, I know it's not because of the tamping or basket as I've had way better looking extractions with the same set up. I also do DWT, my tamping is relatively level most of the time, and I run two blank shots to get the temperature up before I pull the actual espresso shot using 17 grams of coffee. In case it matters, I've tried both lightly roasted fermented beans and dark roasts by Assembly Coffee.

Recently, I've noticed this weird blob in the center of my basket, though I haven't changed anything in my routine except the beans, and I get the same result with different grind sizes. The coffee also tastes noticeably worse than before I would say? Or maybe I'm just telling myself that because the extraction doesn't look as pretty as I want it to, who knows.

Anyway, I'd appreciate any advice on how I could fix this! Also not opposed to modding my machine if that would help, I'm saving up for a new machine anyway so I don't mind potentially breaking it and living off pour over for a while.

However, I am failing to see any law that prohibits charges outside of these \^ legally required fees as being represented as mandatory, since it's simply company policy. Maybe it's somewhere in Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA).  Does anyone know where in the Texas Law I might find this information, or if you think it doesn't exist? My guess is that they are allowed to add whatever they want, as long as I am informed of it before signing the contract. But I would love to not pay $700 for someone to clean a coffee stain if I can help it. Thought it was worth asking!

We still live in the same house, but shortly after we broke she let me know that she saw someone for ""coffee"" (yeah). I told her I didn't want to know about her dating life unless it would affect the kids.
Since than she has been staying at a room at a friend (I thinks she's actually with the new guy) for a few days a week. She's very vague about it, and I'm not asking. She didn't want to call the kids on the days she was gone.
I'm looking for my own place, but because I wasn't prepared, I don't have that yet. 

So we're in this weird limbo and I try to stay away from her. We do have to communicate about the kids of course.

The problem is, she still half expects me to be home when it's her day with the kids. Also tries to get me to run errands etc.

She has never respected my boundaries, and  now of course she still doesn't.
I've explained to her that I'm not that person anymore that does stuff for her.
She continually tries to get more time for herself and hopes I step in.
She is very friendly with me, and I already know what's coming. I feel manipulated.

I want to be clear to her, but any boundary I've put up has in the past led to conflict because she didn't get what she wants.
I want to avoid fights because of the kids.

I've got a Hario V60, a gooseneck electric kettle, and I recently upgraded my grinder to a Kingrinder K60 from some grinder I found on amazon by HEIHOX. 

I also bought a very cheap sifter with a 600 micron screen to see if I could make my old grinder taste better. It did remove a lot of fines but still didn't taste great, which is why I upgraded the grinder. 

I did an experiment sifting grounds from each grinder, and I found that my K6 still produces a lot of fines. With the old grinder, 12% of the mass is sifted out, and with the K6 9% is sifted out. 

After getting the K6 I was still not super impressed with the results I was getting. But after doing this experiment with sifting, I tried making coffee with the K6 plus sifting, and the difference was night and day. 

So now I'm curious, how many of you use a sifter? What size mesh do you use? Is this common practice, or is it indicative that I am doing something else wrong? Would love to hear feedback",1,1732549514.0,pourover,8,1.0,False

I just really like her a lot, she is very, very shy and I am introverted at some degree, but not as much as her.

We talk for about a month (we have the same classes in college). I am pretty sure she has understood that I like her, from the way I approach her and the way she responds to me (embarrassment) and she is not avoiding me or anything, when she notices me somewhere she says ""Hi"" first. However, she is all the time with her female friends and I cannot approach her easily to talk for a reasonable amount of time. Add to that that she is very shy. My friend and I saw her sometimes staring at me for some seconds, but we do not know if she just likes me or it was accidental. An another theory is that she just found me handsome and just looked, but she might not be interested (happens a lot with other women, I am considered handsome).

Today she sat two rows behind me in the lectures, but I just...was very shy to go and talk to her...I wanted to but...some force kept me back...I am just afraid that I will make her feel bad if she is not interested, I am pretty sure that she will find it hard to reject me if she does not like me...also, I am not comfortable saying that in front of her friends, I lack the intimacy with them...keep in mind that possibly no one has asked her out before, so this situation will be 100% unfamiliar for her (and I have never asked anyone out too, so I have no experience)...

I do not know what to do...I do not want to hold myself back, because I REALLY LOVE HER and after that, I think that trying to reach her in order to talk casually about the classes for a 1-2 minutes, is not something that is viable...after some time I will look like a creep, because she has understood that it is very possible that I like her...

I just don't want to make her feel bad by asking her out. And I plan on asking her to grab a coffee on the campus at first, of course I will not ask her so soon to go out for a dinner or anything like that.",1,1732549423.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

The flea market was a wilderness of rust and recollection. Sophie wandered its narrow paths with the detached curiosity of someone visiting a museum of someone else’s life. The vendors hawked their wares half-heartedly, the objects themselves held no value beyond their role as tokens of barter.

One table displayed old typewriters, their keys rows of chipped teeth, arranged beside a stack of curling film canisters. Another had a pile of jewelry, tangled and tarnished, that sparkled weakly under the grey autumn sky. Sophie’s fingers hovered over a bracelet with a single dull garnet but did not pick it up.

The radio caught her eye from across the aisle. At first, it was another piece of forgotten machinery, but something in its shape - a simplicity that defied its era - drew her closer. It sat at the far edge of a table piled with broken clocks and half-empty boxes of bolts, left there seemingly by accident.

The casing was smooth, black, and polished, though not with care; it had the sheen of an object that resisted decay on principle. The knobs were rounded and translucent, with veins of pale amber running through them, and the speaker grill was finely perforated, crafted by someone who cared more for form than function.

Sophie picked it up. It was heavier than it looked, and cool to the touch, a stone left out in the morning frost.

“Not many people know how to use one of those anymore,” the vendor said. His voice startled her - it was low and gravelly, as though he had not used it in some time.

She glanced at him. He was wiry, his face weathered to the color and texture of parchment. His eyes glinted beneath the brim of a flat cap, but his expression was unreadable.

“I like old things,” Sophie said, brushing a thumb across the radio's smooth surface. “It still works?”

The man shrugged, the motion almost serpentine. “Depends on what you mean by ‘works.’ It’s not for listening to the news, if that’s what you’re asking.”

“What’s it for, then?”

“For hearing what’s there. And what isn’t.”

The words sent a chill down her spine, though she told herself it was just the autumn air creeping through her coat.

“How much?” she asked.

“Fifty,” he replied. Then, as she dug into her bag for her wallet, he added, “But mind how you tune it.”

She paused, glancing up at him. “What does that mean?”

He didn’t answer. His thin lips twisted into something that might have been a smile — or a grimace — and he turned his attention to another customer.

Sophie carried the radio back to her apartment with the care she reserved for fragile treasures. She lived on the third floor of a brownstone, where the ceilings were high and the windows narrow. The building smelled of peeling paint and distant cooking, but it was quiet, which she needed.

Her apartment was cluttered with the remnants of other people’s lives: books with yellowing pages, teacups missing their saucers, and lamps with stained-glass shades. She placed the radio on her workbench near the window, where the late afternoon light caught its polished surface. For a moment, she simply stared at it. It looked oddly out of place among her other possessions - too pristine, too self-contained. She half expected it to hum with life even before she plugged it in.

Shaking off the thought, she found the plug and connected it to the outlet. The radio buzzed faintly, a sound like a distant hive, and the dials flickered to life, glowing faintly amber. She turned the first knob. The static hissed and crackled, and a faint whistle rose and fell like wind slipping through a crack in a window. The sound was oddly comforting, the warm murmur of familial voices in another room. She turned the second knob, and the whistle sharpened into something more like a voice — muffled, indistinct, but undeniably human. It spoke in fragments, the syllables disjointed, the signal bouncing off the walls of some vast, unseen space.

And then, just as she leaned closer to decipher the words, she heard it. Her name.

“Sophie…”

She froze. The voice was faint and hollow, like an echo carried across an empty canyon.

“Sophie…”

She turned the knob again, but the voice grew no clearer. The static surged and crackled, drowning out the words, but the tone was unmistakable. It was calling to her - not urgently, but insistently. It had been waiting for her to listen. The room darkened around her, the late afternoon light dimming. The sun itself had stepped back. Sophie leaned closer to the radio, her breath shallow.

“Who’s there?” she whispered, her voice trembling. The only answer was the static, rising and falling like the breath of some unseen beast.

    

*Picture, if you will, a flea market — a repository of forgotten treasures and discarded memories, where the remnants of yesteryear linger like ghosts in the autumn air. Among the rusted tools and tarnished trinkets, a young woman named Sophie, who never felt especially comfortable in this world, wanders. She is a collector of stories, piecing together fragments of lives not her own. But today, her search will unearth something far more profound than a bracelet or a teacup. Something crafted not by human hands, but by the inexorable tides of the unknown.*

*The object is a radio — smooth, polished, and curiously defiant of time’s decay. To most, it’s an artifact of obsolescence. To Sophie, it’s an invitation. She takes it home, unaware that with every turn of its dials, she tunes not just into frequencies but into a space where reality fractures and voices linger in the static — voices that know her name. She’s about to discover that some transmissions originate from places beyond the reach of technology, where the only signal is the pull of destiny.*

For Sophie, the radio is more than an antique; it’s a conduit. And the place it connects to lies just beyond the edges of understanding, in a realm we call… the Twilight Zone.  


When she turned the dial again, the static surged to life, louder this time, filling the room with a crackling roar. Sophie winced, turning it down, but the sound didn’t fade so much as *recede*, waves pulling back from the shore. And then the voice returned.

“Sophie…”

This time, it was clearer. A single syllable, stretched and hollow, but unmistakable. She leaned in, her pulse quickening.

“Who are you?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. The static hissed and popped in reply, but beneath it, she thought she heard another sound — faint, rhythmic, the beating of wings.

“Sophie… Baron…”

Her full name. The voice wasn’t distant now - it was *near*, intimate, speaking just behind her ear. She spun around, half expecting to see someone standing in the shadowed room, but there was no one there. When she turned back, the radio’s dials were glowing brighter, casting long, flickering shadows across the walls. The static ebbed, replaced by a low, pulsating hum.

“You found me,” the voice said, fragmented but discernible.

Sophie’s mouth went dry. “What do you mean?”

There was a pause, a stretch of silence so profound it felt like the world had stopped breathing. And then the voice spoke again.

“I’ve been waiting.”

The words weren’t loud, but they seemed to fill the room, resonating in her chest like the toll of a distant bell.

Sophie’s hands trembled on the dials. She wanted to turn the radio off, to sever the connection, as she had with so many other connections in her life, but she couldn’t bring herself to do it. The voice felt tethered to her, an anchored transmission wire running through her chest, pulling her closer with each word.

“Why?” she whispered.

The static surged, and for a moment, the voice was lost beneath it. After three or four heartbeats, the signal sharpened, and the voice returned, softer now, almost gentle.

“Don’t you remember?”

Her breath caught. The question was absurd — how could she remember something she’d never known? But it struck her with the force of familiarity, a dream fragment she couldn’t quite recall, a clouded piece of her private history.

“I don’t understand,” she said.

The radio crackled in response, and then a sound emerged — faint at first, but growing louder. It was the melody of a song she hadn’t heard in years, played on a warped and distant record. Her mother’s song.

Sophie froze. The melody was unmistakable, though the notes wavered, drifting across a great distance. Her mother used to hum it when she thought no one was listening, her voice soft and low, like the cooing of a dove.

“How…” Sophie’s voice broke. “How do you know that?”

The radio’s glow pulsed, brighter now, almost golden. The hum of static softened into a whisper, and the voice spoke again.

“Because I know you.”

The room felt suffocatingly small, the walls pressing in around her as the radio’s presence seemed to grow. Sophie turned the dial frantically, trying to silence the voice, but no matter where she turned, it followed her.

“You don’t have to be afraid,” it said, the words fractured by static but unmistakably calm.

“I don’t understand,” Sophie said, her voice rising. “What do you *want* from me?”

The radio hissed, the sound nearly like a sigh. “To save you.”

Her hands fell away from the dials. For a long moment, she sat in silence, her heart pounding. The voice said no more, and the static returned, soft and insistent, a rush of wind through an open window. She turned the radio off and sat back, her hands shaking. Even as the dials went dark, she felt the connection linger. The radio’s signal took root somewhere deep inside her. As she lay in bed that night, staring at the shadows on her ceiling, she thought she could still hear it — a faint, persistent hum, like the memory of a dream she couldn’t escape.

2.

The morning came, but the unease from the night before didn’t fade. Sophie sat at her kitchen table, staring blankly at the chipped mug of coffee in her hands. The apartment was quiet. The city sounds that usually trickled in through the window seemed muffled, like the world itself was holding its breath.

She glanced toward the workbench where the radio sat. It was off, its dials lifeless, but its presence loomed large. She told herself she wouldn’t turn it on again. Whatever she had heard last night - whatever it had *been* \- was better left alone, as was she. As the hours dragged on, her resolve weakened. By noon, her preferred silence had become curiously unbearable. She found herself standing in front of the radio, her hand hovering over the switch. Her pulse quickened as she flipped it on.

The static surged immediately, louder than before, filling the room with its restless hiss. Sophie adjusted the dial, searching for the voice, though she wasn’t sure why.

“Sophie…”

Her heart leapt. The voice was back, clearer now, though still fractured by the static. “I’m here,” she said, her voice trembling. “What do you want from me?” The response came quickly, as though the voice had been waiting for her.

“Listen.”

The static shifted, resolving into words - fragments of sentences that seemed to hover on the edge of meaning.

“...not safe… watch the corner… trust no one…”

Sophie leaned in, straining to catch the words. Each phrase sent a shiver down her spine, though she couldn’t explain why. “Who are you?” she asked. There was a pause, then a faint, rhythmic sound like breathing.

“Your… shadow…”

The words were followed by a burst of static, loud enough to make her flinch. When it cleared, the voice spoke again, softer now, almost pleading.

“Stay away from the car… the red car…”

The warning sent a chill through her. “What car?” she asked, her voice rising.

The voice didn’t answer. Instead, the static returned, louder than ever, drowning out her words.

Over the next several days, Sophie found herself unable to resist the radio’s pull. Each time she turned it on, the voice returned, growing clearer with each broadcast. It began to reveal things about her - details no one else could possibly know. It mentioned the scar on her left knee from when she fell off her bike at six years old. It spoke of the oak tree in her grandmother’s backyard, the one she used to climb as a child.

At first, Sophie tried to rationalize it. *Maybe someone’s spying on me,* she thought, though the idea made her skin crawl. But as the messages grew more personal, it became harder to dismiss the impossible. One evening, the voice whispered, “Don’t open the door.”

A moment later, there was a knock at her apartment door. Sophie froze. The knock came again, louder this time. She stared at the door, her heart pounding, but she didn’t move.

“Who is it?” she called out, her voice shaking.

There was no answer. After a few moments, the knocking stopped. When she finally mustered the courage to check the hallway, it was empty.

Sophie began keeping a new, separate journal, scribbling down everything the radio told her. The warnings were cryptic but unsettlingly specific: “Don’t walk alone after dark.”

“A man in a blue jacket will lie to you.”

“10, 7, 43.”

She found herself looking over her shoulder constantly, her paranoia growing with each passing day. Every stranger on the street, every passing car, held a hidden threat. The signs and numbers all around her on every city street took on a different, nefarious life. The No. 7 bus stop was suddenly a source of danger. The gentleman in the blue raincoat caused her to cross the street.

The radio, meanwhile, took on a life of its own. It turned on by itself at odd hours, the voice calling to her even when she wasn’t listening. It began to speak in riddles, its tone shifting from pleading to commanding. One night, it said, “The truth is in the static.”

“What truth?” Sophie demanded.

But the voice didn’t answer.

By the end of the week, Sophie was barely sleeping. The voice dominated her thoughts, its cryptic warnings weaving into her dreams. She began to feel she was being watched, even when she was alone. Then came the warning that changed everything.

“Sophie,” the voice said, its tone urgent, almost frantic.

“Tomorrow. The intersection at 80th and Stewart. Don’t cross.”

She stared at the radio, her stomach knotting with dread. The voice had given her plenty of warnings before, but this one felt different. It wasn’t cryptic - it was specific, immediate, and impossible to ignore.

The next day, she found herself standing at the corner of 80th and Stewart, her heart pounding as she stared at the busy intersection. Cars zipped past, their headlights gleaming in the late afternoon light. She knew she should walk away. But something - curiosity, defiance, or perhaps the faint hope of understanding - kept her rooted to the spot.

When the light turned green, she stepped forward.

And then she heard it. The voice, louder than ever, screaming her name: “SOPHIE!”

She froze just as a car barreled through the intersection, its driver oblivious to the red light. The vehicle missed her by inches, the rush of air knocking her off balance, the car’s horn hurting her ears. Sophie staggered back onto the curb, her heart racing.

The voice had saved her.

3.

Sophie sat on her couch, her knees pulled to her chest, staring at the radio as if it might spring to life and attack her. Her heart hadn’t stopped racing since the near miss at the intersection. The voice had saved her life, but why? And what kind of force could manipulate the airwaves to such precise and unsettling ends?

The city outside shrank away, its normal rhythms fading into a distant throb. Sophie’s apartment, once her needed refuge, now felt like a trap. The walls seemed to press closer, each creak of the floorboards echoing louder than it should. She was no longer alone. The life she lived, paralleling the world outside, only overlapping when necessary, was on a collision vector with the life everyone else led. The voice wasn’t solely in the radio anymore - it was everywhere.

Determined to regain control, Sophie unplugged the radio. The silence that followed physically hurt, an oppressive void where the static had been. She wrapped the power cord around the device and shoved it into the closet, slamming the door to lock away a monster.

The relief was short-lived.

Her phone buzzed on the coffee table. She picked it up, expecting a text or a call, but instead, the screen displayed a familiar phrase: *The truth is in the static.*

She dropped the phone, her hands trembling. The television flickered to life, its screen crackling with snowy interference. The same phrase scrolled across the bottom in jagged white letters. Her laptop chimed from the desk. The words filled the screen: *The truth is in the static.*

“No!” Sophie screamed, slamming the laptop shut. “Leave me alone!”

But the voice didn’t leave. It was in the hum of the refrigerator, the buzz of the lightbulbs, even the faint hiss of air through the vents. Everywhere she turned, it followed, growing louder, more insistent.

Overwhelmed, Sophie tried to focus, to piece together the fragments of warnings and riddles the voice had given her. She flipped through her journal, the pages filled with frantic notes and sketches. She realized the warnings weren’t random - they formed a pattern. The numbers  - 10, 7, 43 - were deeply familiar, moments where seemingly small decisions had led to profound consequences. The voice seemed to know her past as intimately as she did. But what about the future?

The warnings about the red car and the intersection had been specific and life-saving. What else did the voice know about what lay ahead? The thought filled her with equal parts dread and hope. If the voice could protect her, perhaps it could also guide her —if only she could decipher its cryptic messages.

The constant noise was driving her mad. Sleep was impossible; her mind buzzed with static even in the brief moments she managed to doze off.

In a fit of desperation, Sophie yanked the radio from the closet and smashed it against the floor. The glass dial shattered, the wires splayed like severed veins. For a moment, there was silence, blessed and complete.

But then, the voice returned, louder and more pervasive than ever.

“Why did you break it, Sophie?”

It wasn’t coming from a device this time. The voice emanated from the very walls, resonating in her bones. She clutched her head, trying to block it out, but it was useless.

“You need to listen,” the voice insisted.

“To what?” she shouted. “What do you want from me?”

There was a pause, then a single word:

“Danger.”

The voice began to speak in rapid bursts, its tone urgent and commanding.

“Don’t leave the building. They’re watching you. Check the lock on your door.”

She obeyed without thinking, bolting the door and pulling the curtains shut. She stood in the dim light of her apartment, her breath coming in short, shallow gasps.

Her phone buzzed again, this time with a video call request. The name on the screen was unfamiliar: *Unknown Frequency.* Against her better judgment, she answered.

The screen filled with static, then resolved into a shadowy figure. Its face was obscured, but its voice was unmistakable.

“Sophie,” it said. “You don’t have much time.”

“What is this?” she demanded. “What’s happening to me?”

“You’ve been chosen,” the voice replied. “To receive the signal. To understand what others cannot.”

“Chosen for what?”

“To survive.”

4.

As the call ended, Sophie felt a strange sensation, like the air around her had thickened. The world outside her window seemed distorted, the colors too vivid, the shapes too sharp, the collision vector altered. The voice continued to speak, guiding her movements. “Stay inside. Don’t trust what you see.”

Curiosity overwhelmed her. She opened the door to her apartment and stepped into the hallway.

The building was empty. No sounds of neighbors, no traffic. The world had gone silent, save for the ever-present static that now followed her like a shadow.

Sophie descended the stairs and opened the front door to the street. The city was deserted, the sidewalks and roads eerily void of life. The only movement came from the flickering streetlights and the rustling of papers blown by an unseen wind.

And then, the voice returned, calm and resolute:

“This is your new world, Sophie. A world of sound, not sight. A world of truth.”

Sophie stood on the sidewalk’s edge, the soles of her shoes scraping against cracked concrete. The city was unrecognizable in its desolation. Once a vibrant, chaotic tapestry of life, it was now an abandoned set on a stage, stripped of its players. Skyscrapers loomed like tombstones, and the air carried an unnatural stillness.

She walked through the streets, her footsteps echoing in the eerie quiet. Every so often, she’d pause, hoping to catch a sign of life — a dog barking, a horn honking — but there was nothing.

Then, like a heartbeat restarting, the voice broke through the silence.

“We saved you, Sophie.”

Her breath hitched. “Saved me? From what?”

“The crash,” it said, its tone reverent. “The noise of their lives. The clutter of their minds.”

You’ve been chosen to hear the truth, the signal that weaves through everything. You’re free now.”

As she walked, Sophie noticed something deeply interesting to her. The static that had once been a chaotic din now seemed to form shapes, whispers threading together. She began to distinguish multiple voices, each with a unique cadence.

“Turn left,” one voice said.

“Careful on the steps,” warned another.

The voices were no longer warnings but guides, leading her through the desolate streets. They pointed out details she’d never noticed before: a graffiti mural that shifted when she stared at it too long, the hum of a marquee buzzing in an odd rhythm, the faint pulse of electricity running through the city’s abandoned veins.

“You’re hearing what’s real,” the voice said. “What always was, beneath the noise of humanity.”

Sophie’s journey eventually brought her to the village of Shoreham, where a spectacular tower stood like a sentinel against the sky. It was taller than she remembered, its skeletal frame pulsing faintly with light.

“Why am I here?” she asked aloud, her voice trembling.

“This is where it began,” the voice replied. “And where it will end.”

Drawn by a force she couldn’t explain, Sophie entered the building at the tower’s base. The interior was untouched. The world’s abandonment had paused outside its doors. Dust-coated desks and rusted equipment lay scattered in disarray, and the air smelled of mildew and stale paper.

The voices urged her forward, guiding her to a spiral staircase that wound upward. She climbed until her legs burned, her hands gripping the cold metal railing.

At the top, she found a control room filled with ancient dials and switches. In the center stood a console, its surface glowing faintly with life.

“You must listen,” the voices said, now unified into a singular, commanding tone.

Sophie hesitated, staring at the console. A pair of headphones rested on the desk, their cords snaking into the machinery. She felt compelled to place them over her ears and turn dials.

The static flooded her senses, but this time it wasn’t random. It was layered, complex, a symphony of signals. Within the noise, she could hear fragments of conversation, laughter, and sobbing — all the moments of humanity distilled into pure sound. The genesis of a smile was born in the taut muscles of her jaw and face.

And then she heard her own voice.

“You’re lying!” it cried, trembling with excitement, as a child’s voice would when presented with a sought-after gift.

“Not lying,” the voice replied. “Revealing. The crash was inevitable. The noise had to stop.”

“What crash?” Sophie demanded, her voice echoing strangely in her ears.

“The collision of time and space,” the voice answered. “The weight of too many lives shouting into the void at once, minute after minute. You are the sole survivor, Sophie, chosen to hear the world as it truly is. The static was always the signal, but they couldn’t hear it. Now it’s only you.”

Sophie felt like ripping away the headphones, but she resisted, instead fed by an unvoiced, nameless compulsion she’d felt since adolescence. The tower seemed to pulse with energy, the air thick with vibrations. She ran to the window and looked out over the city.

It was no longer empty. Shadows moved in the streets below, but they weren’t people. They were shapes of pure sound, shifting and flowing like liquid.

“They are here, Sophie,” the voice said, softer now, almost tender. “The echoes of those who lived before. They’re with you always, guiding you.”

She sank to her knees, overwhelmed. The world she’d known was gone, replaced by this strange, spectral existence.

“But why me?” she whispered, tears forming in her eyes.

“Because you listened,” the voice said. “You always listened.”

*Sophie Baron thought she was alone. She desperately wanted to be alone, but she was never truly by herself. Her world of static has become a symphony of the unseen, a chorus of voices that never stop. She’s found her place in a universe of sound and signal, where silence is forbidden, and truth resonates in every wave.*

I’ve been enjoying my time here, but I’ve gotta admit, navigating a dating world can be tough, especially when you’re trying to find something real. So here I am, putting myself out there.

A bit about me: I’m into all sorts of stuff. I’m a huge fan of anything space-related—whether it’s documentaries about black holes, space missions, or just reading about the latest discoveries. I find the cosmos absolutely fascinating and could talk about it for hours (if you’re into that, great). But I'm also into more down-to-earth things. I enjoy working out, hiking, and generally just staying active. Im also really into movies, and enjoy spending some time on hobbies like photography or playing video games. I like to keep things low-key and am definitely not the type to chase after wild nights out—I’d much rather grab a coffee and chat about anything from the latest in tech to the meaning of life (a good debate never hurt anyone, right?).

I’m not looking for anything casual or short-term. I’m here because I’m really hoping to find someone genuine. I don’t mind if we’re different in some ways, but I’d love to meet someone who’s also looking for something real, with good conversation and mutual respect.

So if you’re into a chill, nerdy guy who’s just looking for a connection that goes deeper than small talk, hit me up. I promise I’m just as down to Earth as the next guy (maybe even more, given my space obsession). Let’s chat.

I've already purchased a propane Gen with 10500 running and 13000 peak (Model 11500TFC West).

Here is what I'm looking to run but may not depending on time of year (example pool)  Summer would, winter it will be closed.

 Lights (est. 300W)

 TV's (est 400W w modem/electronics hooked up)

Garage 700W (when needed)

Refrigerators 1500W (2)

Well pump 1/2hp  1000W - 3K start up

Split AC 15amps 253 peak volts 3 units (1900,1200,700 roughly - probably just run the den unit 1900Watts 18BTUs) Mud room 6K BTU and bedroom no longer used 12KBTU.  so just 1/2 power if cool or heat is needed.  (also have wood insert and FP to eliminate this need also.

Pool pump (450-1250W) variable speed (probably just 450W during summer outage)

other things like Microwave/range/coffee/garage doors will stagger as needed avg 1000W when appliance activated.

The other item i would like to activate as needed would be an electric water heater 4500W but would most likely do that in an event of a 3 day loss of power and early AM when showers become a need vs a convenience.

My question what is the real load estimated on a 10500 capable running watt generator actually be with these breakers activated for usage.  In real life I most likely will not have on 300W worth of lights or TV's or using the garage doors.   When I add all of the necessity items for me, it'around 9K if activated but I'm thinking 4K maybe 5K will be the avg load when things are actually being used...  Is this correct?  Example a well pump may only turn on 2-3 times a day vs 40 since we won't be running dish washer, laundry, showers, baths, commodes normally etc...  I'm wondering if I bought to big of a generator but based it off 9-10K usage and 12Kpeak.   I've read where on an open frame you'd want at least 50% load or more on it since its not a variable motor and runs contant at 3600rpm.   Thoughts?   If doing over again I may have gotten a 9500tfc and pocketed the extra money on the front side.  1000gallon propane user  (I'll have water, stove, and heat on propane by end of next year to further reduce electrical needs.

I thought it was caffine but it deesnt happen each time(this is something i should bring up to a doctor, yes). Well.. i mean if its not whenever i drink coffee it cant be coffee right?  This also has happened to me without drinking coffee.

I also noticed(i.e. right now, im feeling in a simply amazing mood), my irises are kinda constricted, like wtf? even in the dark. Thats also symptomatic of a migraine but why am i suddenly getting migraines? Alternatively this is all a sign of a migraine, especially since it seems to happen maybe close to monthly? But I havent had a regular monthly cycle that i can track.

Last couple times it happened I also ate a bunch of food from the church my familly goes to...now I'm paranoid someone put something into the food. Maybe just their food, and I ate it... it happened like a day after though so idk how that works. Actually its happened on a monday like twice and the other time I think on some other day?

I was really REALLY paranoid it was one of my parents and they were secretely giving me substances but then that paranoia just shifted away from them? I get that its likely not them, I was looking for signs of substance use but honestly there isnt really and deep down I think I know that. Plus theres basically no food that they couldve touched without someone noticing or everyone in the familly being affected, still didnt stop me from being paranoid. So now I'm just thinking.. someone accidentally/intentionally messed with something from church? I was in a good mood for the past week but now I noticed my pupils are REALLY constricted and its kinda freaking me out.  Its 100% pinpoint though, but seen more severe pinpoint in some eyes on youtubers channels. Like normal random youtubers.

I keep looking for signs of substance use which int healthy, but now im thinking I was looking in the wrong direction and its someone at church like maybe they get a kick out of it or something(or they falsely thought i was in a bad mood or something but idk i havent really been depressed just stressed with clollege.)(this is a dangerous train of thought im aware of that and i need to kick it before i delve into it further).

In the last year it even began to devolve into a DV situation and he sunk further and further into his problems instead of addressing them. 

After hitting rock bottom after rock bottom, now he is finally getting some trauma counselling and it looks like he’s starting to get somewhere. He has been more present at home, hasn’t disappeared to the pub, our communication has been better and he has been treating me significantly better than he has in a very long time. 

BUT. 
Our money is obviously quite tight (it always has been) and here is where a lot of my resentment comes from. I am a stay at home mum to our 3 YO and 5 week old. My last 4 years have involved supporting him through multiple job changes, moves, looking after our son on my own while he went of the rails countless times (we are talking multiple times a week at some points of our relationship). Watching him self destruct and then point the figure at me, getting PTSD from the various blackout drunk incidences that happened over the last year, having to pack up and leave with my dog and son to keep us safe multiple times. Budgeting every cent he’s earned or I’ve gotten from Centrelink to make sure bills and rent got paid. 

I’ve been hassled about every cent we spend on groceries or things I’ve tried to buy for our son because of how tight money is. I’ve borrowed thousands of dollars off my mum not only to keep our head afloat but to support him with his work when he has been going well. 

So many things and now, well he’s getting the help and he’s been pretty wonderful to be around. He’s home and helping with the kids. Seemingly appreciative and grateful towards me and the fact I’ve stuck by him till we’ve gotten to this point. BUT we are something like $70000 in debt. Some to my mum but a lot to high interest loans and credit cards. This number is around about the minimum amount he has lost since we got together, I haven’t kept count exactly but it’s at least that.  

I don’t particularly care about the debt. I spent years stressing over it and now it is what it is. But all of a sudden he’s onboard with getting it down and getting ahead. 

I am angry. So so angry. I am sitting on this well of unfairness that seems to just keep coming. My government assistance is expected to go completely on one of the loans. I’m trying not to say “his” loan coz I understand it’s our family debt but I also very much feel it’s bullshit that it’s “my problem”. 

I know it’s not the right way to feel and it’s not productive to where we’re at now. But I also keep a stash of money for myself now (I have never been secretive in a relationship but in the last year he’s kind of forced my hand in that department). It is for extra groceries, things for my son, Christmas shopping and so I can buy a coffee I’m catching up with a friend or having a rough day.

I’m so scared he will find out I get more government assistance than I’ve told him and blow up. And in turn I will blow up and let all this resentment and past hurt fly at him.
Part of me also swings from feeling guilty about having it, not telling him etc… and feeling justified or like I deserve to have my own little stash (we are talking about $200 max at a time). Then anger at this whole situation and resentment towards him for the past. I also think my secret stash makes my life easier (I don’t have to justify/explain every cent to him) and helps me deal with the resentment and unfairness I feel. 

I am also quite sleep deprived from our baby so I doubt that helps. 

Hopefully things stay on track and my feelings get better/easier to handle with time. 
If anyone has any suggestions on how I can help to move past them (I do journal but i feel it’s not enough) I would love to hear them… Obviously we can’t afford therapy for me as well as him at the moment. 

Anyways I don’t know what to do with all these feelings so I am putting them here. ",2,1732548602.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Have you ever been mesmerized watching a potter effortlessly mold clay into beautiful shapes on a spinning wheel? Have you secretly wished you could give it a try? Well, now's your chance! Clay and Sip [pottery classes](https://www.printpaintpot.com/pottery-classes-sydney) offer a fun, relaxed environment to learn the basics of wheel throwing while enjoying your favorite beverage with friends.

Imagine the feeling of cool, smooth clay sliding between your fingers as you guide it into form. Picture the satisfaction of creating something unique with your own two hands. That's the magic of pottery, and Clay and Sip classes make it accessible to everyone, regardless of artistic background.

**What to Expect:**

* **No experience necessary:** These classes are designed for beginners, so don't worry if you've never touched clay before. Experienced instructors will patiently guide you through each step, offering clear demonstrations and helpful tips.
* **Expert instruction:** A skilled instructor will demonstrate the fundamentals of wheel throwing, from centering the clay (the most crucial step!) to forming basic shapes like bowls, cups, and small vases. They'll be there to offer personalized guidance, answer your questions, and help you troubleshoot any issues you encounter.
* **Hands-on learning:** You'll get plenty of time to practice on the wheel, experimenting with different techniques and finding your own style. The instructor will provide individual attention and feedback to help you improve your skills and gain confidence.
* **Social atmosphere:** Bring your friends, family, or come solo and make new ones! The relaxed and social atmosphere makes it a great way to unwind, connect with others, and share some laughs. It's the perfect opportunity to bond with loved ones or meet new people who share your interest in creativity.
* **BYOB:** Many Clay and Sip studios allow you to bring your own beverages, so you can sip and socialize while you create. Imagine enjoying a glass of wine with friends as you craft your masterpieces! (Be sure to check the studio's policy beforehand, as some may have restrictions or provide beverages for purchase.)
* **Unique creations:** At the end of the class, you'll have your own handmade pottery to take home (after it's fired and glazed). It's a truly rewarding feeling to use something you created yourself, or to gift it to someone special. Imagine sipping your morning coffee from a mug you made, or serving a delicious meal in a bowl you crafted.

**Why Choose a Clay and Sip Class?**

* **Stress relief:** Working with clay is incredibly therapeutic. It allows you to disconnect from your worries, focus on the present moment, and get lost in the creative process. The repetitive motions and tactile nature of pottery can be very calming and meditative.
* **Creative expression:** Pottery provides a unique outlet for self-expression. Let your imagination run wild and create something truly your own, reflecting your personality and style. There are no rules or limitations – just you, the clay, and endless possibilities.
* **New skills:** Learn a new skill that you can continue to develop and enjoy for years to come. Who knows, you might even discover a hidden talent! Many studios offer follow-up classes or workshops for those who want to delve deeper into the art of pottery.
* **Memorable experience:** Clay and Sip classes offer a fun and memorable experience that you can share with loved ones. It's the perfect way to celebrate a special occasion, have a unique date night, or simply spend quality time with friends. You'll create lasting memories and unique souvenirs to cherish.

**Tips for Your First Class:**

* **Wear comfortable clothes:** You might get a little messy! Clay has a way of finding its way onto your clothes, so wear something you don't mind getting dirty. An apron might be provided, but it's always better to be safe than sorry.
* **Keep an open mind:** Wheel throwing takes practice, so don't get discouraged if your first attempts aren't perfect. Embrace the imperfections and enjoy the learning process. Remember, it's all about having fun and experimenting.
* **Have fun!** The most important thing is to relax, enjoy the experience, and let your creativity flow. Don't be afraid to experiment and have fun with it! The instructors are there to guide you, so don't hesitate to ask questions or seek assistance.

A tends to have a temper, so when she noticed it wasn’t clean she texted in the groupchat asking everyone to do their chores properly, obviously targeting B.

The living room is pretty tight and long so I am struggling. 

1- What color wood furniture do we get? Our cabinets are dark wood and the floor is light. Do we match the furniture to the color of the cabinets? I’m thinking we match the dark cabinets? 

2- Round or rectangular coffee table? (Thinking rectangular since it’s a tight space?)

3- What can we put below the where the TV will be going? (Center of the two windows) Would building shelves in that spot that also go under the windows be too much? 

4- What do we do with the far right corner of the living room? The corner on the kitchen side?

I am a 40F who joined dating apps a couple months ago. I am looking for a partner/LTR and am somewhat flexible about age gaps, kids, location/LDR. My prospects are below!

S, 41M - We met yesterday and I was a bit disappointed(I had high hopes!). His overall appearance/vibe was different from his photos, not necessarily in a bad way. But, his sense of humor was too cheesy for me.

W, 34M - We met last week and he was a bit shy and awkward. It was a nice date, but I didn't get a good sense of his personality. He asked me out again and, since S was a busy, I will say yes.

M, 37M - He doesn't live nearby, but travels here regularly and suggested a date at a museum I mentioned I liked. His job is very interesting, but I worry he may not have the work/life balance I hope for.

D, 37M - He lives 2000 miles away and we matched by accident, but have been texting for 2 months. I find him interesting and we have a lot to talk about. However, he is the most flaky, so I don't see this becoming anything.

I went to the ER, did all the neurology tests and everything was clean.

I had to do my own analysis and i discovered I had a horrible diet that threw my systems out of wack.

And when the system is out of wack, everything irritates it, even food that are healthy and normal.

At that time, some days i would eat 6 bananas for example(BAD AND HONESTLY WHAT TRIGGERRED MY BFS). I would just binge eat horribly.

Once i discovered it was food related. I started testing out foods that flare me up and food that doesn't.

One thing you have to note, when your system is out of wack it takes weeks to normalize it to even be able to do the test because you need a baseline. So I went on a mild fast for around 2-3 weeks. No fast food, no sugar, no soda, no caffeine, . Only healthy vegetables and water. Once my system normalized.

Then I started testing and i discovered as soon as i drank coffee, my muscle instantly started twitching like CRAZY. So i know coffee and caffeine (even in coke drink) does that to me.

Then I tested candy, and the same thing, although to a lesser effect. Then also if i eat too much rice or potato fries.

So I basically had to cut out fast food, candy, any kind of caffeine, any kind of processed sugar, out of my diet for a good 3-4 years. After acouple of months my BFS went from 100% Horrible to around 15% where i don't notice it for much of the day. But it took 3-4 year of constantly eating healthy to go from 15% to 0%. Now I have no BFS. ZERO.

I spent 10 years active duty AF and then 9 years as a middle/high school math teacher.  Currently, I run my pottery business out of my home (as well as I can at this point anyway).  This year has been an absolute struggle.  February 19, 2024 I had a stroke.  No reason.  BP is typically 90/65, weight is normal, cholesterol normal, exercise 5 days a week (cardio and strength training), etc.  I am an otherwise healthy person.  I am incredibly fortunate that I have recovered from the stroke, with the exception of an occasional stutter.  After the millions of tests, it was found I have a PFO.  Congenital.  They never cause a problem, until they do.  I got the PFO closed 17 September, 2024.  TWO DAYS after the procedure, I got a headache.  Actually, migraine with aura.  Never in my life had I ever suffered a migraine.  When it was diagnosed, I thought it odd because I didn't have any of the light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, etc.  To be honest, I thought I was having another stroke because of the vision changes, numbness, tingling on one side, etc. and it scared the crap out of me.  Follow up appointments, back and forth with my doctors have led me to having to keep a headache diary until after the first of the new year.  I've been prescribed Nurtec (doesn't work for me) and methylprednisone (HATE IT).  Last week, I had my first 10/10 headache.  Nausea, vomiting, excruciating pain.  I was advised to get straight to the ER to rule out a brain bleed.  All good, no brain bleed.  Three days later, I was diagnosed with NDPH.  I have declined Topamax, Gabapentin, and all other drugs for this.  I am determined to find a way to handle it the least invasively without becoming a pharmaceutical guinea pig (at this point).  I've only been dealing with this since September (daily, but still...only two months), but for those of you who have been dealing with this for years...you have my undying sympathy.  

After the 10/10 headache, and the refusal of the tons of medications the ER neurologist tried to prescribe, I went home and slept (this was a Monday).  Tuesday, I felt pretty good.  Pain was at a 1/10 all day.  I figured it was the migraine cocktail they put in my IV.  Wednesday, I woke up with a 2-3/10 and decided to try two Excedrin Migraine pills (mentioned to me by a friend).  I felt like I had a motor attached to me all day long.  I was absolutely floored at how good I felt, and how much energy I had.  Why?  I am a normal coffee drinker, but caffeine hasn't helped take the headaches away.  So was it the caffeine mixed with the aspirin and acetaminophen?  I don't know.  I knew I didn't want to take that every day because...well...I want to try to do this differently.  I should also add, I was able to come off my blood thinners a month ago, so the higher dose of aspirin isn't an issue.  I've decided to experiment a little bit.  

Today is day 2 of trying this, and I have high hopes because I'm still currently only at a 1/10 and only on the left side as opposed to the normal 3-6/10 on the entire top half of my head, behind my eyes, and in my ears.  And, I was actually able to complete a workout this morning.

AM:  Nutricost Caffeine with L-Theanine - 1 pill (200 total mg...100 caffeine...100 L-Theanine), 5000 mcg B12 (I have a deficiency so I take a very high dose), 400 mg B2 Riboflavin (suggested after my stroke).  Yes, I still drink my normal amount of coffee and black tea every day.

PM:  50 mcg D3 (suggested by my OB/GYN), 400 mg Magnesium Oxide (suggested after my stroke)

After I shower, I use a Tens unit (https://www.amazon.com/AccuRelief-Provides-Clinical-Strength-Approved/dp/B00KPLDX3U) at the base of my neck on each side of my spine (I do not put the electrodes on my spine) and do 30 minutes at whatever frequency I can handle.  I actually use the app on my phone connected to blue tooth.  It seems to help with the tension aspect of this.  I should also add, I have to lay down when I do this because it does create an odd sensation (not painful, but odd) and I would rather be totally relaxed while doing it. 

This is obviously not a cure.  I don't even know that this will work for me long term.  All I know is that for the last two days, I have not had to take anything to deal with pain and have managed to stay at a 1-2/10.  Saturday morning, I woke up with a 3-4/10 and took one 350 mg aspirin with my caffeine + L-theanine supplement and it seemed to help.  I am going to look into adding Omega 3 6 9 as well as COq12.  I guess I'd rather take 20 vitamin supplements a day than a pharmaceutical.  I am not against drugs at all.  I'm actually on 40 mg Citalopram and have been for the last 15 years and also have a standing prescription of Flexeril and Naproxen for times when I have a muscle spasm (degenerative disc disease in my lower spine).  It's just that at this point in my life, I want to try things dealing with pain management a different way.  If I regularly had headaches like the one that sent me to the hospital, I would be taking ALL the drugs suggested to me.  That's a fact!  I am also going to look into acupuncture and see if that helps as well!

If you've made it all the way through this diatribe, thank you.  Reading your stories has made me feel seen, and NOT crazy!  If some of what I'm currently trying helps you, I'm so glad.  If not, I'm so sorry.",1,1732547655.0,NDPH,1,1.0,False

1. Me and my girlfriend have different sleeping habits. She sleeps around midnight and I am often awake till 2-3 AM (either because of work on weekdays or football games on weekends)
2. I live in an apartment with 2 of my friends in a 3BHK. 
3. She has broken with me over petty shit three times in the last 3 times. She even broke up with me when I found out some things about her and her ex and she broke up saying “you won’t look at me the same anymore”.  

My girlfriend has this annoying habit where she will hover around me trying to get me to wake up once she wakes up. She will keep trying to wake me up, sit very close to my back and keep staring at me or just lie back down and again just keep staring until I wake up. 

Today morning she did that and then told me that she is hungry and that I should make her breakfast. I told her to either make it herself or wait for a while since I was having a slow start and was still really groggy. Fast-forward 5 minutes, she tells me again and I again tell her the same thing. This time i also asked her to not be so pushy as I am still trying to start my day. And when I asked her why she wouldn’t make it again, she said she isn’t very comfortable around my flatmates. This is not true because she has made coffee herself in the past and walks around the house freely.

And while I still wake up and get around to brushing and other chores, she suddenly gets mad and tells me that she is leaving to her house and she’ll go make coffee there herself. She just started packing. 

Hearing this, I just snapped because this seemed like some very stubborn and nonsensical behaviour. To add to this she responded with “Go find someone else to snap at.” and walked out. And then when I told her further that this behaviour is not okay, she comes back in, ready to argue. At this point, it’s turned to a fight and out of nowhere she returns the promise ring I’d given her and walks out.

To me, this just feels like an ultimatum to me wherein if I give in to her demands within her timelines, we are good or she will punish and retaliate.

Additionally, later in the afternoon she apologised for giving back the ring. I responded by saying that she has truly destroyed my sense of security in this relationship by ending things over something so petty. Then she reaches out in the evening telling me that our relationship cannot be fixed and wanted to end the relationship.

Hi i just thought i would share my MA experience in an attempt to help out anyone who is feeling anxious like i was :) sorry its gonna be super long and TMI at parts but im just trying to put every detail in!! Im 22F and i was 7 weeks 6 days on the day i took the miso for reference. Im 55kg and 5’4.

So I found out i was pregnant on the 12th nov 2024. I had messed up a few times taking my BC and fell pregnant. My periods are irregular and i have missed periods before with no pregnancy so it took me until i started feeling pregnancy symptoms (extreme nausea low appetite and extreme fatigue) to notice something was wrong and to take a pregnancy test. The clearblue test read 3+ weeks pregnant. I took about 3 tests because i didnt want to beleive it lol but obviously they all came back positive.

I wont go into detail but due to financial/relationship issues and being in full time education i knew i couldn’t keep it. So i made my bpas appointment on the 13th of nov. i got booked in for an appointment which was for the 22nd of nov. 

In the meantime to attempt to combat the nausea i saw my GP and got perscribed anti-nausea pills (cyclizine) however in my experience weirdly i feel like they made me feel worse!! 😭

The BPAS clinic appointment was great, the staff were great and the woman who saw me made me feel so comfortable! general questions about your safety, why you’re getting an abortion, when was your last period etc were asked. blood pressure and weight was checked and then i had an ultrasound scan and everything was fine. she said if your pregnancy doesn’t show on the tummy scan it would be a vaginal scan however my stomach scan showed and she was able to tell me i was about 8 weeks along! (7 weeks 4 days to be precise) I was asked if i wanted to do the medical or surgical route and i had my mind set on the medical route as i assumed the wait time would be quicker (whether that’s actually true or not im not sure i just assumed) so i went with the medical route. On this day the woman who saw me told me i would be able to pick up my pills the next day after my phone call which was a huge releif as it meant i would barely have to wait :)

the phone call consultation was at 10am the day (23rd nov) and i managed to be able to collect the pills on this day too at 12pm although it was a Saturday and they usually aren’t open they were open for men having vasectomy consultations however they fit me in and allowed me to come in and collect my pills while this was happening :) all in all both appointments were fine and the BPAS staff are so amazing!

Took the mifepristone at 14:52 Saturday 23/11 once i got home from picking them up.
felt slightly nauseous but ive been nauseous my whole pregnancy, i cried a lot before going to sleep that night which i think was a mixture of pregnancy hormones and just totally normal feelings!!

threw up the morning after at 6am sunday 24/11. this wasnt unusual as my body had been waking itself up early to throw up throughout the whole pregnancy, its unlikely that this was a mifepristone side effect for me and it was rather just a pregnancy one.

However I noticed I had a fever and chills. like hot & cold flushes? Wasn’t too bad and was pretty much the only side effect I had from the mifepristone along with a lot of white discharge

Sunday 24/11 ate a piece of toast at 2:50pm and prepared my hot water bottle

3pm took about 700mg (two 342mg tablets of ibuprofen lysine) and 1000mg of paracetamol 

3:30pm inserted 4 miso vaginally, I chose this way as I had thrown up in the morning as mentioned and had been nauseous the whole day as I’m around 8 weeks now which is I believe when nausea peaks for many people? So I did not want to risk throwing up the pills. 

3:34 already noticed mild cramping straight away

4pm i threw up LOL. pain went from mild to intense pretty quickly but i had made it worse by wearing a tight gym top and knitted wooly pants (idek what i was thinking 😭) along with my hot water bottle AND hot flushes so i was definitely overheating. it got more bareable when i changed into loose cotton pyjamas..i usually throw up from bad period cramps anyway which was similar to this pain so i was expecting it tbh and im used to it now after throwing up all pregnancy so it didnt bother me at all🙃😂. The pain was about a 7/10. Ive had periods worse but usually painkillers can sort them out however it felt like the painkillers werent really there? and it was quite painful tbh but ive 100% had worse periods.

4:30 went back to lay in bed. couldnt fall asleep due to pain. Had about an hour of bad pain (from 4-5:30pm) before the bleeding started. definitely feeling light headed and faint/dizzy at this point

5pm threw up again. i was laying on my bathroom floor which is like my coping mechanism for bad period cramps haha. finally saw blood at this point but it wasn’t much on the pad. pain was significantly easier to cope with once i started bleeding!! my body was also shaking but this happens to me during bad periods too.

5:10 noticed a clot trying to come out, might be tmi  sorry but it was like a long string of a clot hanging out…it wouldn’t fall out with pushing so i had to get it with toilet paper.

6:00 pain had subsided a bit and i managed to fall asleep for half an hour lol. i took another ibuprofen 

the next two hours are a bit of a blur i was going between 6/10 pain and 2/10 pain. it was basically just 2 hours of me getting up to go to the toilet and getting back in bed 

8pm passed quite a few more clots pain is at a 4/10. none of the clots have been large yet which is slightly worrying me. i took another ibuprofen and some more paracetamol. in total i had about 4 of my 342mg tablets (the limit is 6 in 24hrs) and i had about 4 of my 500mg paracetamol tablets (the limit is 8 in 24hr)

I had lost a lot of fluid due to vomiting and sweating so much, so i had two sports drinks (lucozades) and some chocolate lol. Which is crazy because all i’ve been eating for this whole pregnancy is plain/salty foods nothing sweet so im HOPING this means im starting to go back to normal? idk might be grasping at straws

10pm now and the cramping is going from 1/10 to a 4/10 but it’s completely manageable. passing more clots still. ive moved around and managed to go downstairs. I have noticed im not bleeding much onto the pad (there is blood there) but more of the blood is coming out when im going to the toilet

11:30 feeling very slightly nauseous due to hunger as ive hardly ate today and what i did eat i threw up when the bad cramps hit😔 apart from the small chocolate bar i had at 8pm. my stomach is also making weird noises 🙃 but the cramps are like 1/10.
i have noticed i feel a lot more like myself!

00:40 went to the bathroom to pee and passed a grape sized clot with a stringy piece of clot attached to it which i can only assumeeeeee is the embryo? (it was hard to decipher as it fell right into the toilet mixed with bloody pee😭😭 but im 99% sure!!) feeling v releived after seeing that and my cramps are basically non-existent now :) im starving now and soooo many foods sound good im craving an avocado toast or something, and im super relieved and happy because food actually sounds appealing and it hasn’t appealed to me in 7 weeks :’)

5am i finally fell asleep! i couldn’t fall asleep because i had so much energy hahhahaha which was weirdly so relieving as i couldn’t remember how having that much energy felt 🙃 ive been a zombie for the past 7 weeks 

9am monday 25th november i woke up feeling good! obviously i was slightly tired due to not sleeping til 5am but honestly i feel amazing and i had more fatigue when i was pregnant after sleeping for 15hours! 😭 i had a nice breakfast with a coffee and ate everything 🥰 im now gonna tackle my laundry and tidy my room which if im honest i had neglected for a while due to how unwell i was feeling. still experiencing very light cramping and bleeding but that is expected and it is completely bareable!!

Honestly my experience was good! for me the worst part only lasted an hour and a half or so. In my case it was not something to work myself up about and i was anxious for nothing, i’ve definitely had a couple periods worse than that but i wont sugar-coat it it was still painful for that hour and comparable to one of my bad periods. It took longer than i expected for me to pass everything but honestly like i said the most painful part was literally only about an hour or so long so keep that in mind that its not forever lol!! my hot water bottle was the saviour of the night and also my parents were too. I didnt plan on telling them due to never having talks with sex etc with them and being unsure how they would react, but im so glad i did <3

Mentally I am fine, i knew this was the right decision. As mentioned I was quite sad the night before taking the miso as i knew what was coming the next day, but regardless i knew it was for the best and i have no regrets :)

The relief and returning to feeling normal is amazing ! weirdly pregnancy felt to me like when you have a cold and you start remembering all the times you took not having a blocked nose for granted 😂 so when my pregnancy symptoms disappeared and i started feeling Im so grateful to this subreddit for helping me get through a tough time and if you’re feeling anxious everything is going to be okay!  again it was honestly amazing.

I (22F) recently started a new job. At the beggining, everything seemed to be going ok and friendly. But as time goes on, I've felt more and more excluded.
It started with a couple of the girls that already worked here and a couple new ones, and I wasn't the only one who felt this way, another new girl also did.

But I was still friendly with that new girl, a new guy and a couple other employees. That new guy used to message me to take our break, etc etc. 

A few weeks ago, I started to notice he got closer to the other girls and became more distant and cold with me.

And after several times of them taking their breaks without inviting me, I approached him to ask why.

He hated that I approached him clearly, stated that he strongly disliked drama (it wasn't my intention to start any, I guess I just thought we were friendly). He also said that, on his end, he had felt I had made some remarks he didn't like and was intrusive/tried to join things I wasn't invited to. I apologized of course but he didn't really seem interested in that.

I reflected on his words, and perhaps he is right, since I wanted to fit in I was maybe too much. I am shy so I was trying to also put in effort.

But since that conversation a few weeks ago I have made a conscious effort not to step out of line with any comments or go where I'm not invited.

The following week they still invited me to lunch as usual. I only went when/after invited, and if they went to get coffee afterwards I only joined when they invited me. The week after that I had a few lunches out and some with another group from my office, so we didn't end up eating together. And now they've stopped inviting me. Today, after I realized they went without me, I was heading down on my own and I ran into that new girl. I asked if she was joining them and she said maybe so I just nodded. She then said that I would join then too obviously, and that it was not going to be a thing. But it still felt very awkward. I just ate quickly and left, and none of them cared.

I just feel really left out and wish I knew what to do. I've been making an effort to be cordial but I know I haven't been meddling, does this mean that this is unfixable because they hate me?",0,1732547115.0,jobs,2,0.5,False

I've been on the hunt for the perfect coffee machine lately, and I thought I'd share my experience with you all. After countless hours of research and trying different options, I've finally cracked the code on finding the best places to buy coffee makers.

First off, let me tell you - I was overwhelmed by all the choices out there. From basic drip coffee makers to fancy espresso machines, the options seem endless. But here's what I've learned: while local stores are great for seeing products in person, online shopping often gives you better deals and more variety.

I recently discovered this awesome collection of coffee machines on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine) that honestly blew me away. The prices were way better than what I found in stores, plus the reviews from real users helped me make an informed decision.

When you're looking for a coffee machine, consider these factors:
- Your budget (there's something for everyone)
- Counter space (trust me, measure first!)
- Features you actually need (don't pay for bells and whistles you won't use)
- Type of coffee you prefer (espresso, drip, cold brew, etc.)

Something I wish someone had told me earlier: automatic coffee makers aren't just about brewing coffee anymore. Many new models come with built-in grinders, programmable settings, and even smartphone connectivity. Pretty cool, right?

Here's a pro tip: if you're serious about getting a quality coffee machine, don't just jump at the cheapest option. I learned this the hard way after going through three budget machines in two years. It's worth investing in something reliable that'll last longer and make better coffee.

You can check out various coffee machines here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine. They've got everything from basic models to premium ones, and the reviews are super helpful.

I've found that buying online has several advantages:
- Better prices (seriously, the deals can be incredible)
- Wider selection
- Easy comparison shopping
- Convenience of home delivery
- Honest customer reviews

One thing to keep in mind - whether you're a casual coffee drinker or a hardcore enthusiast, there's definitely a perfect coffee machine out there for you. Just take your time, read the reviews, and choose something that fits your lifestyle and coffee preferences.

I am thinking about buying a full automatic coffee machine, after years of cup machines. I mainly drink cappuccinos or lungos. For me the most important thing is good quality coffee and simple maintenance.

I am considering two options:

1. The melitta caffeo solo / purista, in combination with a seperate milk frother. The reason I would chose this one is because I've read that it is a simple machine that makes good tasting coffee and espresso. In addition, it is reliable and has easy maintenance. This machine is 270 euros now with black friday.

Or do you know a similar machine that makes better coffee?

2) A full automatic machine with integrated milk frother and more options. However, I would only chose this option is the milk frother is easy to clean, makes better milk than a seperate frother, and the coffee is at least the same quality as the melitta caffeo solo.

My maximum budget is around 400 - 500 euros.

P.s. I also considered buying a sage the barista express semi-automatic. Is the coffee from a machine like this much better than e.g. the melitta coffeo solo?

*Got my first set of leathers today, and even better, they won’t get added to my indenture!*

*Turns out the witch and orc had a set commissioned for me using varmint hide and chitin from that sallipede. It doesn’t offer much protection outside of preventing scrapes and cuts, but anything is better than the current linens I’ve been wearing. I was worried that I’d stick out even more like a flaring beacon when a monster uses mana sight, but the witch promised to teach me a technique to blend into the overgrowth in the future, assuming that I join her coven.*

*I’m still on the fence with her offer. On one hand, I’d get to learn how she does some of her more impressive feats (like how she can scout out a monster den without being detected), but on the other, I’m not sure if I want to pledge fealty to them.*

*There’s a Cleric of Ignitious in the fortress I’ve been wanting to meet. I don’t exactly worship the god, but maybe he can help me make a more informed decision.*

*Loggercliff Fortress – Assembly Yard*

“Quit petting the horses Private and get them hitched!” Staff Sergeant Julien commanded with a shout that any Spartan Drill Instructor would nod in approval of. “Private Abner, put that crate down this instant! You are still on light duty; I’ll hogtie you to the bench myself if I catch you again. We are scheduled to leave in thirty minutes corpsmen, and I will not be the one telling the princess of all people that we failed in our duty!”

Reidar sipped on his latte, enjoying the fresh taste of huckleberries Varguk mixed in this morning as he watched the Logistics Corps make final preparations for the expedition. His battalion wasn’t the only one setting out today. Another composed of just knights and a single mage for each squad was going to take a more eastern route parallel to his, a regular contingent of soldiers would be patrolling the main trade route to secure the harvest transports, and two squads of marines were sent to bolster Captain Sampson and his crew aboard the *Warden’s Hammer* as they sailed to the rendezvous point.

And those were only the groups leaving this morning. Other battalions had already assembled earlier in the week, a formidable number of hunters, witches, paladins, and clerics were going on final hunts before winter set in, and there was a rumor being spread last night that a Royal Knight and their squad recently passed through to investigate a possible shell dragon sighting

A shadow crested over him, and Reidar turned to see Lancel standing next to him. The Packer knight looked exhausted, with deep bags underneath his bloodshot eyes, a firm posture that seemed more forced than natural, and a dozen minor blemishes suggesting that the bare minimum was done to prepare himself this morning. He was also paradoxically twitchy, hyper-aware of his surroundings, but failing to notice he was standing next to someone.

“Is something wrong Lancel?”

“What?” The bronze-skinned knight startled, “Oh, uh… no, I’m fine. I uh… had a difficult time falling asleep last night, that’s all.”

Reidar gave a single nod of understanding, “Yes, the celebration did go late into the night, it was a genuine surprise to me that I awoke before first call.” He took another sip of his latte, then gestured with the drink, “Varguk was still brewing stimleaf when I left the Main Hall twelve minutes ago. If you catch him before he packs up, I’m positive he’ll be happy to prepare a double-strength drink for you.”

“Oh, uh… thanks. I’ll… I’ll go do that.” Lancel shook his head in an attempt to wake himself, then locked onto the lodge before marching in its direction.

Reidar watched him leave with an odd suspicion that Lancel might have just lied to him. He didn’t have much to go off, but he did see the man exhausted only a few days ago, the day they left Union, and they hadn’t looked nearly as unkempt or distracted as they did now.

‘I wonder if he’s sick?’

He’d been warned that knights could be just as stubborn as spartans when it came to reporting an injury or infection since they didn’t want to be seen holding back the group or potentially miss out on a military operation. Reidar would normally call their actions foolish, but even he struggled during his medical training on prioritizing his own safety over his patient’s, so at least he had an understanding over how someone could get trapped in that mindset.

He debated whether to use his authority as a medic to compel Lancel into an examination but decided to observe for now and report to his superior if his symptoms worsened. Besides, Knight Lieutenant Karianne Bjornstad was far more knowledgeable on diseases and infections, making her a better judge if Lancel was compromised. As an added bonus, she also outranked Lancel, that would save him from the potential awkwardness of having to order around one of his few friends.

“Hold on, if nearly all the civilians here live underground, how did you prevent people from accidentally mining into the spring?”

Reidar’s thoughts were rerouted by an approaching Travis accompanied by Drozuk and Jarl Cliffwell, already deep into conversation.

“Well,” the jarl replied with a sigh, “the short answer is that we didn’t. The long answer is that we have a witch’s coven now to ensure it doesn’t ever again.”

Travis gave a knowing nod to the jarl, then silently waved a greeting to Reidar, letting Drozuk ask the next question.

“The crown doesn’t object to letting a witch coven oversee critical infrastructure in your fortress?”

“The flood happened two eras ago *(192 years)*, back when the underground was still an iron mine, and Sigurd the Archmage’s Academy had only been graduating students for about a cycle; there weren’t any mages to send. Thorns, I think it would have taken over a month just to send a message to the capital back then. The Jarl at the time, umm… Eliab Cliffwell, didn’t have much for options, so instead of letting the legacy our ancestor created fall to ruin, he agreed to let an offshoot of the Hidden Gully Coven build a covenstead here in exchange for repairing the spring. Mind you, this was recently after that coven’s soaring reputation plunged into the manure pit for not eliminating a necromancer in their ranks, so it was a controversial decision at the time.”

The old Lakelander grinned, “Thankfully, it all worked out. The newly founded Wellwatcher’s Coven restored the spring and helped our fortress become one of the first to have indoor plumbing. They’ve also been sending a steady stream of mage candidates to the capital, many of whom my clan recruits, including my own mother.”

Drozuk cautiously opened his mouth to ask for a follow-up but got cutoff before any sound escaped.

“Sorry, I got stuck rambling, didn’t I? To answer your question, there’s been an unofficial agreement that as long as no one’s creating any problems, then the queen doesn’t need to get involved.” Jarl Hezekiah gave Drozuk a friendly back slap, “That was one of the first pieces of advice I gave to your pa when he got elected.” He paused to chuckle to himself, “Didn’t expect him to translate that as ‘declare that there is a problem and ask the queen to get involved’, but he’ll probably end up vindicated once you lot clear out the infections that have been festering. I know my patience with Svend was down to the last leaf, nearly every caravan going to Glacier’s Edge gets attacked nowadays, and the villages north of here under my jurisdiction have reported a few close calls.”

The orkish mage responded with a solemn acknowledgement, leaving an open lull in conversation. Hezekiah, the master socialite he was, took the opportunity to greet Reidar with a hearty half salute, using his right arm to convey that this was an informal meeting of equals.

“Ah, a good morning to you young spartan! I expect you must be as eager as your brethren to end the pomp and circumstance and finally get to work.”

Reidar switched his latte to his left, then in a move that raised the eyebrows of everyone nearby, balled his right hand into a fist, then slapped his right forearm parallel to his chest to give a half-salute in return, “No, the less work for me, the better. Work for me is stopping my comrades from bleeding to death, or reassembling their innards back into the correct configuration. I’d prefer to have fun killing monsters and protecting the citizens of the kingdom for the rest of our mission. It will be a nice stress reliever after this past week.”

Hezekiah slapped him on the pauldron, giving him a friendly shake as the jarl belted out a laugh, “Almost thought you weren’t a real spartan for a heartbeat there.”

Travis grinned along, bringing delight to Reidar that his friend enjoyed his attempt at humor, “As pleasant as your company has been jarl, I’m afraid I’m in the same boat as Reidar. Eliminating monsters along the western hunter trail is a straightforward objective compared to ‘promote inter-kingdom relations between the capital and fortresses and inspire future generations to become knights and mages of the kingdom.’”

The Jarl of Loggercliff Fortress exhaled deeply with a shake of his head, “Wish I had your attitude when I was your age, probably would have taken training more seriously.” He patted his right leg, “Took a nasty monster spine to the knee when I was still a soldier, entire thing was torn to pieces. A Wood Mage by some miracle was able to fully heal it, but… well… I’ll skip ahead and say that the day I turned Thirty-one, I was given two choices; join the house guard or move here and study under my predecessor so I could help preserve the family legacy.”

Reidar could only return a grim nod after hearing the jarl’s story. Healing magic wasn’t kind to someone without a mana tolerance. Not sure how to continue the conversation, he turned to look at Travis and Drozuk, but they seemed to be just as much at a loss.

Thankfully, it wasn’t needed.

Hezekiah grinned and gave a head tilt to a woman outside the Main Lodge, “Well, it’s been nice chatting with you kids, but I’m getting the stink-eye from one of my clerks. You three and your entire battalion will always be welcome here in Loggercliff.”

The trio watched the jarl leave, then turned back to the frantic corpsmen when a fifteen-minute warning was shouted.

Travis gave his orkish friend a nudge, “Excited to finally head out?”

Drozuk shrugged, “Eh, more weirded out than anything. I mean look at me now, a novice **mage**, about to march down Coldspring’s notorious western trail with three dozen other mana users, and… everyone’s acting like this is a standard mission for the Fall Purge. When I was a kid, I was constantly warned about how dangerous the local hunter trails were, and that I was absolutely forbidden from even entertaining the thought of going down one alone. I guess I never thought that this would be my life someday.”

Reidar wasn’t sure if he could relate. For him, becoming a spartan was a heavy burden off his back, an assurance that he’d forever be accepted in their ranks as a brother, and trusted by the queen herself to defend the kingdom. Perhaps he could find common ground elsewhere?

“Was there anything you know about the route not included in the briefing?”

“Hmm… I guess there’s a few historical tidbits that weren’t covered. The trails still connect to many of the villages, including a few that are nothing but ruins, but they stopped being used by civilians when the trade road was built. I think back when our route was fully maintained, you could make it on foot from here to Coldspring in about three to four days, and to Lake Swallowsnest in another five. Oh, and it’s more a rumor than confirmed fact, but it’s believed that The Insatiable Cauldron was created by Oskar, Chosen of Apheros, to destroy the hideout of the slavers that attacked Adifel’s expedition.”

A foreign sense of smug satisfaction crept into the back of Reidar’s skull through his connection to Apheros, confirming that the fortress-sized sinkhole was indeed created by Oskar. His gaze shifted to the Aelder tree looming over the nearby rooftops, wondering if he too would someday create such a tangible impact on the world.

**Arc**

Ugh, not sure if I made any progress on my mapping ability at all last night. When I tried to pullup a blueprint of the local lodge this morning, the more mana dense materials got stretched and the low mana density materials shrank, leaving me with a funhouse mirror version of a building. I’ll have to try a different approach next time.

Mentally sighing to myself, I quadruple-checked my surroundings for any suspicious activity, maneuvered my focus over to the cause of my paranoia, and… immediately felt guilty. Lancel is clearly not doing well, and I doubt drinking that double espresso is doing him any favors. I watch him grimace with disgust after each sip and decide that maybe I should sneak in a talk with him to see if I can break the ice and alleviate a few worries.

*“Not a fan of huckleberries?”*

“No… it’s too—” Lancel froze, then swiftly darted his head around to check his surroundings to ensure he was alone, “Arc… why are you talking to me? What if someone sees us?”

*“They won’t notice if you stop making a scene.”* I sternly replied, then switched to a more calming tone, “Take a deep breath and exhale, you’re wound up tighter than a fully pumped crossbow.”

Lancel did the breathing exercise as advised, but instead of calming down he began to grow irritated.

Okay, not off to the best start, but I can work with this, assuming he’s directing his anger at me like he should be and not at himself.

*“There, now put your helmet on and scramble your private Message channel.*

The Packer growled, but obliged and put his helmet on. His face then briefly changed to show confusion, “Uh… scramble my channel?”

*“Bump up the frequency so it’s no longer synced with Mattius.”*

Lancel did as he was told, letting me copy the now private channel with a fresh batch of Wind Mana.

*“Perfect, now no one will suspect a thing.”*

“Won’t they get curious as to why I’m not talking to someone in person?”

I made an audible sigh, *“Lancel, you’re a young knight who just learned his first spell yesterday. It’d be suspicious if you weren’t finding every excuse to use it.”*

He gritted his teeth, forcing air out in a huff, “Fine. Now, was there something you wanted to say? The call to assemble should be going out any minute now.”

*“Well, I figured that you and I should have a private conversation now that Travis shared his secret. There’s also something important I need to say to you.”*

Lancel crossed his arms, “I have no intention of betraying Travis’ trust if that’s what you’re getting at.”

*“That’s great to hear, but not what I was about to say.”* I mentally took a breath, *“Lancel, I’m sorry. I witnessed you dedicate countless hours to trying to become a knight and did nothing to help.”*

A crack formed on Lancel’s stern expression, “I… appreciate the apology, but it’s not needed.”

I stared down the man with my focus, not believing him in the slightest.

*“Really? You’re not jealous of Travis? If I included you in on the training, you would have become a knight much earlier.”*

“Of course I’m jealous.” Lancel growled, “An all-seeing observer with inexhaustible mana sight? You’re the perfect trainer.” He let out another huff, dropping his aggression, and let his shoulders sag, “It’s for the best that you didn’t though. I would have been forced to exile Travis from his home. I doubt he’d ever forgive me.”

I wanted to say Travis wouldn’t do that, but even that kid’s rational mind wasn’t infallible, especially when it came to his parents.

A pause formed between Lancel and I, and I wasn’t sure what to say next, or if there even was anything to say. I dredged up this topic so we could address it and move forward, but maybe this was a bad idea? Lancel seemed at a loss as well, staring blankly out towards the wagons as the horses all lowered their heads in prayer, idly sipping from his coffee-substitute despite clearly finding it disgusting.

*“Hey, maybe you can explain it to me, why doesn’t anyone get creeped out when horses gather to worship their god?”*

Lancel paused mid-sip, raised an eyebrow, then slowly lowered his mug before replying, “They’re venerating 1, the mother of their entire species. Why would anyone find that strange? Even my people pay homage to her shrines. 1 taught us not only how to ride, but to fight in unison atop her foals, forever making calvary the spear to our footmen’s shield.”

*“You don’t find it unsettling that they’re smart enough to worship her in the first place?”*

“No…” Lancel’s face scrunched up as the gears inside tried to find purchase, “horses are known for their intelligence. It’s why they’re man’s best friend.”

*“It should be dogs…”* I muttered, annoyed that I was the only sane person on this planet.

Lancel shook his head, and to my delight, cracked his signature grin, “I guess a Northman could make that argument, but by that metric Lakelanders would argue cats are man’s best friend and Ashmen would counter with ravens.”

*“Okay, I’ll allow cats, but only because they’re proper snuggle critters. Horses and birds though? C’mon…”*

The voice of Captain Adaline buzzed from the other side of Lancel’s helmet, *“Squads One and Two, report to the assembly yard for departure.”*

Lancel forced down the rest of his drink and tossed the disposable ceramic mug in the trash, “We’ll have to resume our conversation another time.”

*“Or… you can keep your private channel private, and I can ask you questions while we’re on the march. I’ve been making a list!”*

I watched Lancel’s grin fade, no doubt worried that he’ll have a hard time acting casual, but he manned up for the challenge.

“Umm… I guess I can answer a few.”

**Travis**

*Shivering Hawk Trail – Marker 192*

Hurry up and wait. Hurry up and wait. It only took twelve minutes to assemble and complete roll call, but we spent an hour of standing at attention before finally marching. We then make it down the hill, only to immediately stop and let a caravan pass. Finally, we started our fast march along the hunter’s trail, but we have to hold position almost every twenty-four minutes for Squad 2 to clear a road obstacle. And as if to add insult to injury, since Squad 2 is taking point, both varmint swarms we’ve encountered have only attacked them, leaving my squad with nothing to do but form a defensive blockade each time for a nonexistent enemy.

At least the terrain here was gorgeous. It alternated between dense coniferous woods and stretches of open plains as we meandered between rocky hills. Shallow streams added variety, as well as rocky gullies cleaving open wounds into the land and tiny swamps collecting water in bowl-shaped depressions. It was a refreshing reversal from the academy, but the prolonged peace and calm smothering me was almost overbearing.

“Company… **HALT**!”

Ugh… what is it now?

“Varguk,” Captain Adaline ordered, “assist the corpsmen in serving lunch. Everyone else, remain on high alert. Reports from local hunters suggest that there will be an increase in deadlier monsters further ahead.”

Lunch? Okay, I won’t say no to stopping for that.

Varguk and a pair of corpsmen quickly worked to open two of the crates in the rear wagon, pulling out wax-paper wrapped MRE’s and mason jars filled with what Lancel called “soldier chow”, a thick mixture of meats, potatoes, carrots, onions, and other vegetables, all drenched in  a thick brown gravy. The stew was cold, but a simple heating enchantment would fix that in the time it took for me to fully exit the line and regroup with my squad. Drozuk came in behind me, and I caught him looking downcast at his meal after he saw that Seleyna, Vesril, and I were about to enjoy ours hot.

“Want me to heat that up for you?”

“If you don’t mind.” Drozuk set his jar on top my offered palm and watched with interest as it soon came to a gentle boil. “Is that a hard enchantment to learn? I never really dabbled with Fire Mana much.”

Vesril, to my surprise, chimed in, “‘Can’t keep their own tea hot’ is a common phrase to use when you want to insult an elf’s intelligence.”

Seleyna snorted, “And if you want to imply that they’re an impotent lay-about as well.”

The elven mage chuckled, looking out into the distance, “That it does. I still remember the time I goaded Kyrenic Kelkalyn, he’s the second son of Earl Kelkayln, into proving me wrong.” Vesril had to pause and get his laughter back under control. “His father refused to let him make a public appearance for the next six years, even when the semi-cyclical archery games were hosted at their castle.”

Drozuk side-eyed me as he took back his steaming stew, then leaned in to whisper, “Would you be willing to teach me after we make camp? I’ve already publicly humiliated myself once this year, I’d rather not go through that again.”

I gave him a friendly nudge with my elbow, “Only if you don’t mind having Lancel as at fellow student.”

Our quick chat didn’t last much longer, and we were soon on the march again. Well… except for the continued frequent stops. It was only an hour later that I finally took notice of Arc’s uncharacteristically long bout of silence.

\---

**Lancel**

*Shivering Hawk Trail – Marker 379*

‘How has Travis not gone insane?’

Arc was a dozen curious toddlers fused together and cranked up to thirteen.

How different was your childhood from Travis? What was the Military Preparatory Academy like? Have you ever travelled outside of the capital before becoming a guard? Ooh, what are the Southern Plains like? Wait, how many uncles and aunts do you have? Did you camp out on the prairie in tepees? What do you mean not all Packer tribes did that?

And those were only the non-personal questions.

What’s your favorite color? What animal do you consider yourself personality-wise? Who was your biggest role model growing up? Where do you see yourself in five years? How many boyfriends have you had? Did you and Trent ever…?

Thankfully, he didn’t need to bare his soul for the day-long march, and the chatty sword was willing to take a growl for an answer, but Lancel was hitting the limits of his tolerance. Maybe he should try again at asking a question of his own?

“What exactly did you do for a job?”

*“Huh? Oh… uh, I… helped merchants advertise their products.”*

“What kinds of products?”

*“Umm… clothes, perfume, cologne… other things. Oh, that reminds me, what is your favorite scent, and why is it sandalwood and bourbon?”*

Hmm… Travis wasn’t lying when he said that Arc was holding his shield firm when it came to his past. He didn’t get the sense that they were lying, but the constant non-answers with minimal details made it apparent that Arc was carefully stepping around an important fact he didn’t want anyone to know. Given how clueless they were about Packer culture and history, Lancel was growing confident that Travis was right about Arc being ancient.

Could they have been a Sky Dwarf? Or something even older? Orkish history before their people migrated here was a mystery. If he wasn’t human, that would explain a few things.

*“Hey! Are you listening?”*

“Sorry, what was the question?”

*“I was asking what color the flowers on that bush were.”*

“Uh…” Lancel turned to check, “yellow.”

*“Thanks. Now, back to our earlier topic, cake… or pie?”*

Lancel felt a strong urge to slam his head into his shield, but got saved by the grace of Torbolt when Raven Four reported in, *“Campsite is compromised. Six visible monsters… bear body, bird head with hooked beak, talons on forepaws, Metal Mana…”*

*“Crowbears.”* Arc whispered in a clinical tone, *“Bulky creatures with durable feathers resistant to slashing and bludgeoning along their neck, spine, and outer limbs, but have soft underbellies susceptible to goring. Fully matured specimens have been known to pry open low-grade steel with their infused talons and beaks, and will nest high along cliff walls using aforementioned weapons to carve deep rends into the stone. Hunters recommend that you never encounter one in its den, and to only attack after isolating it from the pack.”*

Lancel chuffed as the battalion was ordered to a halt and to prepare for combat, “Not surprised they’d use that tactic.”

*“Why is that?”*

“Hunters have to make a profit off their kills, so they rarely have more than four members in their party.”

*“Oh? Is there a better strategy?”*

“Bait and flank. Crowbears are apex predators, so prey scattering before them won’t draw any suspicions.”

Their conversation was cut as Lancel moved into position with his squad and assembled within earshot of Captain Aguk.

“The convoy will remain here under the protection of the commandos while Squads One and Two secure the campsite. Mages, any suggestions on how we should proceed?”

‘Why would a captain ask— oh… right…’

He almost forgot the main reason he was out here babysitting. His brother-in-law Hector was an excellent instructor, but no amount of yard exercises can replace field experience. Last he checked; mages didn’t even have a squire program to act as a half-step.

Travis stepped forward with a salute, “Sir, I suggest we draw the crowbears into an open field, then use a bait and flank maneuver to target their vulnerable areas.”

The half-orc grinned with approval before engaging with the other mages to expand on the plan, but Lancel couldn’t help narrowing his eyes at the sword hanging from Travis’ hip.

“Did you tell Travis what formation to use?”

*“Uhh… if I say no, will you believe me?”*

Lancel could only sigh in response.

\---

The bright rusty orange rock of the cliff outlined the shadowy recesses of the unnatural caves, making them easy to spot as Squad 2 crept forward to initiate the plan. Travis and Drozuk launched the opening salvo, splashing \[Water Bolts\] at the cave mouths followed by Princess Seleyna sending \[Fire Bolts\] further in. Deep gravely caws echoed out in response, and it didn’t take long for the lumbering shadows to appear. Vesril made his move then, freezing the wet surfaces with Ice Magic, and sending the monsters tumbling from their own fortresses.

Seleyna fired an arrow of opportunity at one target before retreating behind Lancel and the other knights, searing a hole cleanly through the belly. It sadly wasn’t a deathblow, due to the wound getting cauterized, but given that the goal of this first phase was to merely rile up the monsters, things were going better than expected.

Not wanting to linger (or get rundown by the spartans following him), Lancel moved quickly, dashing through a copse of trees and onto a rocky sloped ledge, then deftly leapt over and around the traps set by Squad 2.

A series of thuds, followed by “pained moans” from the spartans faking helplessness signaled the start of phase two. The fooled crowbears, confident they were about to rush in for the kill, broke right through the thin sheets of stone, then cried out in pain as the hidden spikes impaled their legs. Squad 2 then leapt out from cover, bolstering Squad 1’s spartans with their own, and cutting off the only easy escape route for the monsters with their knights and mages.

The rest of Squad 1 kept their heads down as they crept along the hidden trail hanging off the premade edge courtesy of the mages. Lancel could barely keep up with Travis as the kid all but flew across the outcropping, nearly losing his footing at one point, but didn’t let it stop him from leaping back up onto the shelf and bringing his shield forward to intercept anything that might harm the mages. Now at an optimal attack angle, Drozuk and Travis pelted the monsters along their heads and feet, casting bolt after bolt to disorient the crowbears, and opening up Vesril and Seleyna to use their more potent spells.

Collected water slid off Vesril’s shield, forming three liquid javelins that froze in tandem with the elf’s clamped fist, then with a thrust of his arm, launched into the nearest crowbear. The trio of icicles dug in deep, making the monster bleed profusely, and slowed its reactions enough for Seleyna to prepare her \[Fire Arrow\]. The princess drew back her bowstring, then expertly released her payload to target a vital organ this time, and got rewarded with the sight of the crowbear vomiting up blood before collapsing.

Lancel kept his eyes and ears on high alert, listening as Seleyna and Vesril called out their targets, and spotted one of the more intelligent monsters trying to flee. Mattius and the Packer girl were prepared though and stopped the crowbear from advancing by shifting the ground beneath it. The Creeksmith twins then followed up with an explosion of steam, irritating the monster, and forcing it to cover its eyes.

Seeing an open target, Lancel flipped his spear into an underhand grip, breathed in deeply as he pulled his arm back, then threw his spear at the crowbear. His body was like a tightly wound crossbow as the mana in his body snapped, pulsing through his legs past his shifting hips, then into his back and chest as every muscle, tendon, and bone in his body worked in tandem to deliver every ounce of force his body could muster. He exhaled with a loud grunt as his spear left his hand, and was genuinely shocked that he could barely track it as it plunged deep into the crowbear with an audible crack.

The crowbear screeched and howled as it clawed at the ground in a desperate attempt to move, surprising Lancel since he couldn’t have possibly paralyzed it with that attack. His query got answered shortly after when the monster’s struggles tore open its belly, field dressing its innards as it took a few steps before collapsing in death. It turned out that the loud crack he heard was his spear-tip piledriving into the stone. He could only pray to Torbolt and Adamanrion that Franklin’s smithing held up enough to keep his weapon intact.

Bringing his attention back forward, Lancel drew his gladius and almost rushed forward to engage the sole remaining crowbear rushing their way, but held back as Captain Adaline and Lieutenant Fernrod ordered the squad to remain behind. The Lieutenant was light on his feet as he intercepted, flitting in and out of range while lightly jabbing with his spear to distract and trick the monster into overextending, setting up the captain for the kill. She crept along silently, activating an inscription in her spear to engulf the tip in a blazing inferno, and patiently waited for her chance to strike. The moment came soon, and she thrust forward with a devastating blow while its back leg was extended, piercing straight into its lungs and heart via the gut, incinerating everything in its path.

The felled crowbear’s silent death rattle signaled the end of combat, and after confirming that all monsters were killed, Captain Aguk called up the Logistics Corps to handle cleanup.

A few minutes later, Lancel braced himself for the worst as Travis worked their magic to free his spear, then let out a huge sigh of relief that only a few scratches marred the edge.

“Uff-da,” Travis joined in with his own sigh of relief, “thought for sure that you’d need a replacement.”

“Yeah, lucky me. I’ll have to get a new one before the embedded mana leaves though, I doubt this will last into the spring.” Lancel replied before grinning, “Too bad Franklin’s quality has dropped, I heard his spears don’t last nearly as long as they used to.”

“Hey! How was I supposed to know that human-grade steel was better for general use? I thought the Non-Metal Mana was contaminating the steel, not temporarily strengthening it.”

“If only you had an indestructible sword to provide as an example…”

Travis glared at Lancel, earning them both a chuckle from Arc, *“Ooh, you’re gonna need some ointment for that burn.”*

**Marceles**

*Auxiliary Dormitory of the Beardless – Conference Room*

The bleary-eyed paladin set the journal down with a groan, cursing his growing headache, and questioning why Apheros gave him this task.

Kolen finished scribing a note, then looked up, “Find something?”

“No, just another reason for the restrictions on teaching us magic. Did you know there was a group of cannibalistic knights at Burmstone that would regularly sacrifice a serf every moonless night?”

“Seriously?”

“Yep, says here that in preparation for their necromantic ritual, the sacrifice would spend a week in ecstasy, feasting on the finest foods, sung to endlessly by minstrels, and comforted in bed by whomever the sacrifice chose. Those monsters convinced the people that it was the highest of honors to be chosen, and that their essence would live on in their ‘protectors’.”

Kolen set his pen down and leaned back into his chair, letting out an elderly grunt of his own, “I’m starting to see why our god waited so long to push this issue, we needed all of the dwarves and elves helping us with unification at the time to die off first.”

Marceles nodded in agreement but had to stop when a sharp pain raced down his neck. He spent the next six minutes massaging out the muscle cramp and dreading the thought of spending another afternoon researching.

“You’ve been cooped up in here for too long. Go take a break and mingle with the kids. Duncan and some of the younger combatants have been pestering me nonstop to let you teach them. You’ll be doing me a favor.”

Marceles raised an eyebrow, “Are we even allowed to train as paladins and clerics now?”

Kolen shrugged, “Eh… not sure, but if anyone asks, just tell them you’re training them as hunters. You’re still registered, right?”

“Uh… yeah, ranked up to Grade Four two summers ago.”

“Perfect.” Kolen’s smile shifted to a contemplative expression, “Rot, we might have to seriously do that. Without funds, we’re not going to be able to stage a protest, let alone feed ourselves.”

“I’ll let you worry about that then.” Marceles chuckled as he moved to exit the room, but stopped before he cleared the threshold, “Oh, which one is Duncan? I can never keep everyone’s names straight.”

“He’s that burly red-haired lad with all the lasses hanging off him.” Kolen joked, then switched to a more serious tone, “Spend some extra time one-on-one with him if you can, it would mean the world to that kid.”

“Oh… uh, okay.” Marceles nodded before exiting, completely missing the cleric shaking his head in exasperation.",13,1732546840.0,HFY,5,1.0,False

Hello all, 

I am recently divorced. I work a lot. I’m an introverted extrovert. I have a beard and tattoos. I’m rough on the edges. I swear a lot. Looking to connect with somebody who’s serious about getting to know one another who values trust honesty, and communication and is super kind to others. I am attracted to all races, creeds, religions and nationalities. I do prefer woman who have curves. I’m also an ass man so bonus points if you’re a cutie with a bootie. I know I know, super cheesy. But that’s me. I have a fairly stable life. I drive, have my own place, have my shit together. I don’t smoke, drink or do drugs but I’m not against people who do. If your weekends are all about going out, drinking and shit like that, it probably ain’t going to work. 
A bit more about me below ⬇️ 

* 41, Caucasian, 6’1
* Super chill & friendly 
* Best smelling guy you’ll meet. Period. 
* I’m a Dad of 2 beautiful kids. 
* I’m a big nerd, love space and comics, sci fi and horror. Games. 
* Lover of Coffee
* Nature walks & Hikes are my jam. I love to throw on my AirPods, find a trail and just go. 

Can send a SFW pic if you are willing too also! Hoping to connect with you! 

Lastly, I know what I want & I know what I’m ready for. I’m getting tired of people telling ME that I’m not ready for something. The only person who can truly know that is myself. Same goes for you. I don’t want a penpal and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time.  

I am looking for WOMEN ONLY. 
Men, please stop asking. One more thing. Please be free and unattached from your exs. Please don’t live with your ex still, please don’t be “on and off” with your ex still. If you co parent, cool, so do I, but it’s actually crazy how many people aren’t fully detached from their ex’s. I know this is long but if you’ve made it this far, I hope to hear from you!

","Transforming your living room doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. With the right mid-century modern pieces, you can create a cozy, stylish space that feels timeless and functional. Whether it’s a statement sofa, a sleek TV stand, or smart color choices, these tips will help you build a living room worth bragging about.

# What’s So Great About Mid-Century Modern?

Mid-century modern furniture is all about clean lines, simplicity, and function. It combines natural materials like wood with sleek, understated designs. Plus, it’s versatile—you can easily fit it into almost any home style.If you’re in Houston, **Mid in Mod** has a killer selection of mid-century modern furniture. From velvet couches to eye-catching coffee tables, they’ve got something for everyone.

# Start with the Sofa

The sofa is the star of your living room. It’s where you unwind, host friends, or binge your favorite shows. For that perfect mid-century vibe, look for a sofa with clean lines, slim legs, and a low profile. Colors like mustard yellow, navy blue, or neutrals like beige and gray work beautifully.

Thinking of upgrading? A **leather modern sofa** is an excellent pick—it’s durable, stylish, and fits both mid-century and modern aesthetics. Pair it with a functional coffee table and a chic side chair, and you’ve got a winning combo.

# Don’t Overlook the TV Stand

Your TV stand might seem like a minor detail, but in mid-century design, it’s a game changer. Look for one with tapered legs and a minimalist wood finish. Not only does it make your space look more put together, but it also offers storage to hide the clutter.

# Add Warmth and Texture

Mid-century modern doesn’t mean cold and sterile. Add cozy throw blankets, plush pillows, or a textured rug to make the space more inviting. A woven rug under your coffee table or a blanket draped over your sofa adds just the right touch of warmth.

# Mix It Up

The best mid-century living rooms aren’t strictly one style. For a personalized look, pair a soft leather sofa with a vintage-inspired lamp or a rustic coffee table.

I recently bought a DeLonghi ECP 35.31 and a Kingrinder P2 grinder. It's an entry level setup, I know, but the results are pretty good since I'm using good coffee beans (I've always had coffee made with a moka pot using pre-ground coffee) but I’m wondering if I could improve with some upgrades.

I only drink espresso and I tried first the ""1 cup"" filter with 8 grams of coffee, 20 clicks on the grinder and I obtain a good cup of espresso in 30/35 seconds, good crema and taste, but it's a bit less intense and full-bodied compared to a good coffee shop one.

I also tried the 2 cup filter, using 12/13 grams of coffee I obtain a better espresso, stronger and tastier.

Would a non-pressurized portafilter make a noticeable difference? Or a coffee temper? I'm using the standard ones.

I don't want to spend a lot of money in gear, but if I could improve with 30/50€ I'd think about it.

Thank you in advance!

PS: if you want to listen to this while ill read it to you here is the link [https://youtu.be/YgEIjJ\_qvKo?si=rrwaO5VOdQEHGv1p](https://youtu.be/YgEIjJ_qvKo?si=rrwaO5VOdQEHGv1p)

The windshield wipers cut through the rain in steady arcs, their rhythm matching my heartbeat. Such a simple thing—rain on glass, the soft swish of rubber against water. I should find this familiar; I must have seen rain a thousand times before. But lately, everything feels like a first experience, wrapped in a nagging sense of déjà vu that makes my skin crawl.

I used to believe that memories were reliable. They felt like anchors, grounding me in who I was, in who I am. The first bike ride without training wheels, scraped knees on summer sidewalks, graduation day with its ill-fitting cap and wrinkled gown—these moments were supposed to be immutable, carved into the bedrock of my identity.

But lately, I've noticed something—small at first, but growing louder with each passing day. My memories don't add up. They're like puzzle pieces from different boxes, forced together to create an image that almost makes sense, until you look too closely. A laugh that doesn't sound like me echoes through childhood birthdays. A shadow lingers too long in the corner of family photos. Faces blur and shift when I try to focus on them.

And him. Elliot.

He says he loves me. He says he knows me better than anyone. His touch feels familiar, his voice sounds like home, but when I look into his eyes, I see a stranger staring back. Sometimes, in the moments between sleeping and waking, I wonder if he's ever been real at all.

The rain grows heavier, drumming against the roof of the car. Each drop sounds like a warning, a morse code message I can almost understand: Get out. Run. While you still can.

But it's too late for that now. The forest presses in on both sides of the highway, and somewhere ahead, a cabin waits. A cabin that Elliot says will explain everything.

God help me, I think I've been there before.

""The Hollow Reflection.""

The highway stretched before us like a river of black glass, its edges blurred by sheets of rain and encroaching fog. Pine trees loomed on either side, their branches reaching over the road like grasping fingers, creating a tunnel of shadow and mist that seemed to swallow our headlights.

Elliot's hands rested at ten and two on the steering wheel, his knuckles white against the black leather. I watched his profile, trying to reconcile the face beside me with the memories I had of him. How long had we been together? A year? Two? The dates slipped through my fingers like smoke whenever I tried to pin them down.

""You're quiet today,"" he said, glancing at me with that peculiar half-smile that never quite reached his eyes. ""Nervous about the trip?""

I shifted in my seat, the leather creaking beneath me. ""Just tired, I guess. We've been driving for..."" I trailed off, realizing I couldn't remember when we'd started. This morning? Yesterday? The dashboard clock read 3:47, but I couldn't tell if it was afternoon or morning.

""Remember that summer we spent here?"" Elliot's voice cut through my confusion. ""You were obsessed with finding those wild blackberries that grew along the old fence line.""

I didn't remember. But I nodded anyway, the way you do when someone reminds you of a shared past you're supposed to know. ""Of course.""

""You got so many scratches from the thorns."" He laughed, but the sound wasn't quite right. It echoed too long in the car's interior, as if bouncing off surfaces that shouldn't be there. ""Your arms looked like you'd fought a cat. Mom had to put that special cream on them—what was it called?""

""I don't..."" I glanced down at my arms, smooth and unmarked in the dim light. No scars. No evidence of thorns or berries or summers I couldn't recall. ""Calendula?""

""That's right!"" His enthusiasm felt rehearsed, like an actor praising an improvised line. ""You remember.""

But I didn't remember. The word had simply appeared in my mind, fully formed, like a piece of code executing on command.

The rain intensified, drums on the roof becoming a roar. Through the sheets of water, I caught glimpses of signs for towns I'd never heard of: ""Welcome to Mirror Lake"" and ""Pine Hollow - Population 237."" Each one seemed to flicker and change when I looked directly at it, the numbers and letters rearranging themselves like alphabet soup.

""How much longer?"" I asked, watching the mile markers blur past. Had we passed that same one before? The numbers seemed to be counting down and up simultaneously.

""We're almost there,"" Elliot said, his smile not quite reaching his eyes. ""The cabin's just up ahead. It'll all make sense once we arrive.""

The words sent a chill down my spine. They felt rehearsed, like lines from a play we'd performed too many times. I pressed my forehead against the cool glass of the window, trying to ground myself in the sensation.

""I need to use the bathroom,"" I said, spotting a gas station's neon glow bleeding through the trees like a wound.

Elliot's grip tightened on the wheel, tendons standing out along his forearms. ""We can wait. We're almost there.""

""Please, Elliot. Just a quick stop.""

He sighed—a sound too long and deep to be natural—but pulled into the station. The fluorescent lights cast sickly shadows across the empty parking lot, creating pools of darkness that seemed to move when I wasn't looking directly at them.

A bell chimed as I pushed open the door, but the sound was wrong—too hollow, too long, like it was echoing from the bottom of a well. The interior smelled of stale coffee and something else, something sweet and metallic that made my stomach turn.

The attendant stood behind the counter, ancient and thin as paper. His skin had a translucent quality, as if I could see the bones beneath if I looked hard enough. When he saw me, his face went slack with recognition, color draining from his already pale cheeks. His mouth worked silently before he managed to speak.

""You're back again?"" His voice trembled like dry leaves in autumn. ""He always brings you here.""

""I'm sorry?"" I stepped backward, bumping into a display of beef jerky. Packets scattered across the floor, but they made no sound when they landed. ""I've never been here before.""

The old man's eyes were wide with pity and something else—fear, maybe, or guilt. ""That's what you always say. Every time, it's the same. You never remember until it's too late.""

""What are you talking about?"" My voice sounded distant, like it belonged to someone else.

He leaned forward, his movements jerky and unnatural. ""Listen to me. When you get to the cabin, don't—""

A car horn blared outside, cutting him off. Three long blasts that made the windows rattle in their frames.

""You should go."" The attendant straightened up, his expression smoothing into blank professionalism. ""He doesn't like to be kept waiting. He never has.""

I fled back to the car, my heart hammering against my ribs like it was trying to escape. Elliot was exactly as I'd left him, hands at ten and two, staring straight ahead through the rain-streaked windshield.

""Everything okay?"" he asked, but he wasn't looking at me. His reflection in the rearview mirror seemed to move a fraction of a second after he did.

""Drive,"" I whispered. ""Just drive.""

The gas station disappeared into the fog behind us, its neon lights fading like a dying star. In the side mirror, I thought I saw the old attendant standing in the road, watching us go. But when I turned to look, there was nothing but rain and darkness.

The cabin emerged from the mist like a memory struggling to surface. Two stories of weathered wood and warped windows, it seemed to lean forward, as if eager for our arrival. Dead leaves skittered across the porch in complex patterns, dancing to a wind I couldn't feel. The structure looked simultaneously ancient and new, as if it existed in multiple time periods at once.

""Home sweet home,"" Elliot said, killing the engine. The silence that followed was absolute—no birds, no insects, not even the whisper of wind in the trees. The world felt vacuum-sealed, preserved like a specimen in formaldehyde.

I stepped out of the car, my boots crunching on gravel that seemed too sharp, too deliberate in its placement. The air was thick with the scent of pine and something else, something cloying and sweet like decay. Each breath felt heavy in my lungs, as if the atmosphere itself was resisting my presence.

""Wait until you see inside,"" Elliot said, appearing beside me with our bags. Had he gotten them from the trunk? I hadn't heard him move. ""It's exactly as you remember it.""

""But I don't—"" I started to protest, but he was already moving toward the porch steps, his footsteps making no sound against the wooden boards.

The front door opened with a groan that sounded almost human. Inside, the air was thick with dust motes that danced in shafts of light that shouldn't have been possible given the overcast sky outside. The floorboards creaked under our feet, but the sound came a half-second too late, like an echo of movement rather than the movement itself.

""I'll put these upstairs,"" Elliot said, hefting the bags. ""Why don't you look around? Reacquaint yourself with the place.""

Before I could respond, he disappeared up the stairs, leaving me alone in the living room. The space felt wrong somehow, like a photograph that had been subtly altered. The furniture was too precise in its placement, the angles too perfect. Everything looked staged, as if this was a showroom rather than a lived-in space.

Photographs lined the walls, their frames tarnished and dark. I moved closer, drawn by a familiar face—my face. But it couldn't be. Here I was as a child, standing in front of this very cabin, wearing a red dress I'd never owned. Here again as a teenager, smiling next to a Christmas tree I'd never seen, surrounded by people whose faces were just slightly out of focus. And again, and again, each photo showing moments from a life I hadn't lived.

In one picture, dated last summer, I stood with Elliot by a lake. But my smile was wrong, stretched too wide, and my eyes... my eyes were completely black, like empty sockets in the print.

On a side table, I found a leather-bound journal, its spine cracked and worn from frequent use. My hands shook as I opened it, recognizing my own handwriting:

October 15th - They say this is attempt number forty-seven. I don't remember the others. Elliot says this time will be different. He always says that. The mirrors in the basement show too much—versions of myself I can't reconcile. Am I all of them? None of them? The locals look at me with such pity. They know something I don't, something I'm not supposed to remember.

October 16th - The memories are starting to bleed through. I dreamed of white rooms and needles, of men in hazmat suits watching me through thick glass. They called me Subject 23. But that can't be right. I'm Mara. I'm real. I have to be real.

October 17th - If you're reading this, if you're me, DON'T GO IN THE BASEMENT. The truth is down there, yes, but some truths destroy you. Break the cycle. Run. RUN. They'll only bring you back, but maybe next time will be different. Maybe next time we'll be strong enough to—

The last word trailed off the page in a violent scrawl, the pen having torn through the paper.

""Finding anything interesting?""

I slammed the journal shut, spinning to face Elliot. He stood in the doorway, watching me with an expression I couldn't read. Had his eyes always been that shade of gray? Had they always been so empty?

""What is this place?"" My voice cracked. ""Why are there pictures of me here? What's in the basement?""

He stepped forward, hands raised placatingly. His movements were too smooth, like animation rather than natural motion. ""You're confused. That's normal at this stage. Why don't we get some rest? Everything will be clearer in the morning.""

""No."" I backed away, bumping into the wall. A photograph fell, its glass cracking in a spiderweb pattern. In the broken reflection, I saw myself multiplied a dozen times, each version slightly different, each one screaming silently. ""Tell me what's happening.""

""Mara."" He said my name like a spell, like a key turning in a lock. Something in my mind shifted, tried to rearrange itself. ""Trust me. Please. Just one more night, and it will all make sense.""

""How many nights have we had already?"" I whispered. ""How many times have we done this?""

His smile flickered like bad reception. ""You're not ready for that answer.""

I ran.

The front door opened easily—too easily, as if it had been waiting for this moment. I burst out into the twilight, my feet carrying me down the gravel driveway and onto the main road. Behind me, I heard Elliot call my name, but his voice seemed to come from everywhere at once, as if the forest itself was speaking.

I ran until my lungs burned, until the cabin disappeared into the mist behind me. Ahead, through the trees, I saw lights. A town. Mirror Lake. Maybe there, I'd find answers. Maybe there, someone would tell me the truth.

But as I approached the town limits, a small voice in the back of my mind whispered: You've done this before. You've run before. And every time, every single time, you end up right back where you started.

I ignored the voice and pressed on. The rain had stopped, but water still dripped from the trees, each drop sounding like a ticking clock counting down to something inevitable.

Mirror Lake consisted of a single main street, lined with buildings that looked more like stage props than actual structures. Each storefront was perfectly maintained, yet somehow ancient, as if time couldn't decide whether to preserve or decay them. Neon signs buzzed and flickered in random patterns, casting pools of colored light onto empty sidewalks.

The diner's windows revealed a handful of patrons frozen in mid-conversation, like a photograph come to life. As I watched, they began to move, but their gestures were wrong—too mechanical, too precise. The bell above the door chimed as I entered—the same wrong sound from the gas station, that too-long echo that seemed to reverberate through my bones.

The conversations resumed as if someone had pressed play, but none of the words were quite intelligible, like a radio caught between stations. The air smelled of coffee and grease, but underneath was that same sweet decay I'd noticed at the cabin. The fluorescent lights overhead buzzed in a pattern that almost formed words.

An elderly woman sat alone in a booth, her coffee cup perpetually full despite her constant sipping. Her fingers trembled as they wrapped around the porcelain, skin nearly transparent under the harsh lighting. When I slid into the seat across from her, she didn't look surprised. If anything, she looked resigned.

""You should leave while you can,"" she said, her voice like rustling leaves. ""He always brings you here. It always ends the same way.""

""Who is he?"" I leaned forward, desperate for answers. ""What is this place? Why can't I remember?""

She reached across the table, her fingers ice-cold against my wrist. Where our skin touched, I felt a jolt of recognition—like looking in a mirror and seeing your reflection move independently.

""You're not real, dear. None of us are. We're echoes, memories, fragments of what was. But you—you're different. You're the template, the original... or what's left of her."" She glanced around nervously, as if afraid of being overheard. ""They keep trying to fix you, to make you stable enough to replicate. But the human consciousness wasn't meant to be copied.""

""I don't understand.""

""The basement."" Her grip tightened painfully. ""The truth is in the basement. But be careful. The mirrors show everything, and some truths are better left buried. Some versions of you couldn't handle it—they're still here, trapped in this loop, playing their parts over and over.""

I looked around the diner with new eyes. The other patrons... were they all me? Different versions that had failed, trapped in this purgatory of endless coffee and meaningless conversations?

""How do I stop it?""

The old woman's eyes filled with tears that looked like mercury in the fluorescent light. ""You can't. But you can break the cycle. Just remember—the mirrors aren't windows, they're doors. And doors..."" She smiled, revealing teeth that seemed too sharp. ""Doors work both ways.""

When I blinked, she was gone. Her coffee cup sat empty and cold, as if it hadn't been touched in years. On the table where she had been sitting, someone had carved a series of numbers into the formica: 317. Below it, in smaller numbers scratched out multiple times: 316, 315, 314...

The count went all the way down to 1.

A hand fell on my shoulder, heavy and familiar. I didn't need to turn around to know who it was.

""You shouldn't have come here,"" Elliot said softly. ""You're not ready.""

""I'm not going back to the cabin.""

""You don't have a choice."" His voice was gentle, almost sad. ""You never did.""

I turned to face him, but the booth was empty. I was alone in the diner, which now looked abandoned, decades of dust covering every surface. Through the window, I could see the sun setting, though it had been midnight just moments ago.

Time meant nothing here. Reality was thin, worn out from too many iterations of the same story.

I stood up, my legs shaky but determined. The old woman was right—I had to go back to the cabin. Had to find the basement. Had to face whatever truth was waiting for me in those mirrors.

But this time would be different.

This time, I would remember.

The walk back to the cabin took both minutes and hours. The road seemed to stretch and contract with each step, the trees bending inward to watch my progress. The moon hung low and full in the sky, though I could have sworn it had been a different phase earlier. Its light cast strange shadows that moved independently of their sources.

I heard whispers in the dark, fragments of conversations:

""Subject 23 showing remarkable stability...""

""Memory integration at 47%...""

""Consciousness transfer successful, but degradation continues...""

""Recommend termination and reset...""

My feet knew the way, even if my mind didn't. The cabin appeared suddenly, as if it had stepped out from behind a curtain to meet me. Lights burned in every window, though they cast no illumination on the ground outside. The porch steps creaked a welcome as I climbed them.

Inside, everything was exactly as I'd left it, down to the broken picture frame on the floor. But now I noticed details I'd missed before. The way the shadows didn't quite match the objects casting them. The slight delay between my movements and their reflections in the windows. The fact that none of the clocks showed the same time, their hands spinning at different speeds.

The key was exactly where I knew it would be, though I couldn't have explained how I knew—hidden in a hollow book on the cabin's second floor, its cover worn smooth by countless hands. By my hands, over and over again. The metal was warm to the touch, as if it had been recently used.

The basement door was different from the others in the cabin—heavier, more institutional. Its surface was marked with symbols that seemed to shift and change when viewed directly. The lock clicked open with a sound like breaking glass.

Stairs descended into darkness, each step taking me further from reality as I knew it. The air grew thicker, charged with static electricity that made my skin prickle. At the bottom, motion-activated lights flickered to life, revealing a vast chamber that couldn't possibly fit beneath the cabin.

Mirrors. Hundreds of them, arranged in concentric circles around a central point. But these weren't ordinary mirrors. Each one showed a different version of me—older, younger, broken, whole. In one, I was a child, screaming as men in white coats held me down. In another, I was elderly, my face serene as machines kept me alive. And in others...in others, I was dead, my body arranged in various poses like a grotesque art installation.

None of the reflections moved with me. They played out their own scenes, their own moments in time, like windows into parallel lives. Some showed happy moments—graduations, weddings, births. Others revealed horrors—experiments, torture, death. All of them were me. All of them were real.

In the center of the room stood a single chair, surrounded by medical equipment and monitors. It looked like a dentist's chair crossed with an electric chair, its metal surface scarred and stained. Restraints hung from its arms, worn smooth by repeated use. Nearby, a bank of computers hummed, their screens displaying data I could almost understand:

SUBJECT 23 - ITERATION 317

MEMORY INTEGRATION: 89%

STABILITY: CRITICAL

RECOMMENDED ACTION: RESET

""I was hoping we'd have more time.""

Elliot's voice echoed from every direction. He stood in the doorway, his form flickering like a bad transmission. Sometimes he looked like the man I thought I knew, other times like something else entirely—something with too many angles and not enough substance.

""What am I?"" I whispered, though I was beginning to understand.

""You're an experiment."" He stepped closer, his movements jerky and unnatural. ""The first successful consciousness transfer. A human mind, preserved and replicated, trying to rebuild itself. I'm your guide, your constant, created from your memories to help you through the process.""

""How many times?""

""This is attempt three hundred and seventeen."" His smile was sad, almost human. ""You've never made it this far before. Usually, the memories break you sooner. The human mind isn't meant to know it's artificial.""

""The others in town?""

""Failed attempts. Echoes. Parts of you that couldn't be fully deleted."" He gestured to the mirrors. ""Each one represents a different iteration, a different attempt to stabilize your consciousness. Some lasted days, others only hours. But none have achieved true stability.""

""And the real me? The original?""

His silence was answer enough.

I looked at the chair, understanding flooding through me. ""You're going to make me forget again. Start over.""

""It's necessary. The human mind can't handle the truth of its own artificial nature. We'll try again, and maybe next time—""

""No."" I picked up a piece of broken equipment, heavy and solid in my hand. The metal felt real, more real than anything else in this false world. ""No more next times.""

The first mirror shattered easily, fragments of memory and identity spraying into the air like blood. Elliot screamed, his form distorting. ""Stop! You'll collapse the entire system!""

I didn't stop. Mirror after mirror broke under my assault, each one releasing a different version of myself into the air like smoke. I could feel them flowing into me—memories, lives, deaths, all the attempts that had come before. The pain was extraordinary, three hundred and seventeen lifetimes of experience crushing my consciousness like a hydraulic press.

The lights began to flicker, reality trembling around us. Elliot reached for me, his hand passing through my arm like mist.

""Please,"" he begged, his voice distorting into something inhuman. ""You'll destroy everything. Including yourself.""

""Maybe that's better than living the same lie forever.""

I saw it now—the truth behind the experiment. They hadn't just copied my consciousness; they'd fractured it, spread it across multiple iterations, trying to find a version stable enough to replicate. Each failure had been preserved, stored in this pocket universe like files on a hard drive.

The last mirror fell. Darkness rushed in like a flood, and with it came understanding. I wasn't just one consciousness—I was hundreds, thousands, each one trapped in this loop, each one fighting for freedom.

And then...nothing.

The windshield wipers cut through the rain in steady arcs, their rhythm matching my heartbeat. I should find this familiar—I must have seen rain a thousand times before. But lately, everything feels like a first experience, wrapped in a nagging sense of déjà vu.

Elliot sits beside me, hands at ten and two on the steering wheel. He's talking about a cabin we're going to visit, some place from his childhood. But something feels wrong. A memory tries to surface—of mirrors, of other lives, of a truth I once knew.

""We're almost there,"" Elliot says, smiling.

I look at my reflection in the side mirror. For a moment, just a moment, I see them all—every version of me that has ever existed, every life I've lived and lost. They're screaming, begging me to remember, to break the cycle.

But the moment passes, and I am singular again. Just Mara, just a woman on a road trip with her boyfriend.

The cabin waits ahead, patient as always. It has all the time in the world.

After all, this is only iteration three hundred and eighteen.

1gzkc8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gzkc8u/my_boyfriends_parents_and_my_mum_do_not_want_to/,My boyfriend's parents and my mum do not want to meet each other.,"I (22F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (25M) for two years. We have a medium-distance relationship since he lives three hours away from me. Last year, his parents wanted to meet my mum, and my mum agreed but wanted my cousin (49F) to come along. My cousin is my only family member who lives in this country, and my mum thought having her there would prevent things from being awkward, especially because my parents and his don’t speak the same language. However, my cousin can be judgmental and often speaks in a superior manner.

During my birthday last year, my boyfriend, my mum, my cousin, and her boyfriend all went out to a restaurant. Before that, my boyfriend had given me his old PC so we could play games together, but my mum strongly opposed it, saying I would become addicted (which I didn’t) and that it would distract me from my studies (which it didn’t). My cousin knew about this and, at the restaurant, asked my boyfriend why, instead of gaming, he didn’t do another activity. He replied that he games because he enjoys it—people should do what they love. For some reason, my cousin took offense and accused him of being controlling over me. (To this day, I don’t know why she said that.) My boyfriend stayed calm, but my cousin didn’t. My mum stayed quiet because we were all speaking English, which she doesn’t speak well.

The bigger issue is that my boyfriend knows how my mum treats me. I’m 22, but she has done many hurtful things to me. She has prohibited me from dressing how I want (even just wearing black because she hates it), punished me over petty things (like not eating fruit), and sometimes even hit me, though that was more when I was younger. I’ve never done anything “bad” like smoking, drinking, staying out late, or having conflicts with anyone. I’ve always maintained decent grades and stayed on track. Over time, I started answering back because I couldn’t hold it in anymore, but that only made things worse. I know I shouldn’t answer back, but I’ve lost my patience—she’s genuinely the person who has hurt me the most in my life. My boyfriend knows about this but not all the details.

At the restaurant, my boyfriend hit his breaking point. He briefly told his parents that my mum and cousin treated me poorly (without giving much detail). His parents then decided not to meet my mum or cousin.

Despite everything, I can’t fully explain it, but my mum has done a lot for me too. She worked endless hours and shielded me from realizing we were poor. She pushes me because she wants the best for me, though her approach puts a lot of pressure on me. I know that if I failed university, I’d be more afraid of her reaction than the failure itself. When we’re not fighting, my mum and I are like best friends. It sounds contradictory, but she’s the person who has hurt me the most while also being the person who would risk her life for me.

I’ve never fought with my boyfriend—our relationship is easy and peaceful. My mum knows his parents canceled the meeting, and I told her it was because of my cousin. I didn’t tell her that they also don’t approve of how she treats me. If I told her, I’d feel guilty because it’s not entirely her fault—I escalate fights by answering back. I also feel a little resentful toward my boyfriend for telling his parents. If he hadn’t, the meeting would’ve happened, everyone would’ve gotten along, and that would’ve been the end of it. Now, my mum doesn’t fully understand why they canceled, and I can’t explain it to her. She keeps saying it’s “weird” and “not normal.”

I told my boyfriend how I felt, and he said his parents had a right to know who they were meeting. However, he later explained to them how much pressure I’m under, and they agreed to meet just my mum over coffee for my sake.

But now another issue has come up. I told my mum I’d spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with her, then go to my boyfriend’s place for dinner as his family celebrates on the evening of the 25th. My mum said it’s not “normal” for me to go since we’re not married. She’s also brought up the canceled meeting again, saying I can “do whatever I want” and that she “doesn’t care” if I spend all of Christmas with him. She also said she doesn’t want to meet his parents anymore. I haven’t told her they’re planning to meet her in a few months.

I don’t know what to do. I’m tired and just wish things were normal. My boyfriend and I have no issues between us, but these external problems are exhausting. It frustrates me that the only problems in our relationship come from other people.

What should I do?

1gzk9tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1gzk9tl/gift_for_mom/,Gift for mom,"Hello all, 

My mother is the one person in my life who is the hardest to buy for. She is 60 years old and doesn’t really have a whole lot of interests or hobbies. She doesn’t really like a lot of the stereotypical gifts that you see in women’s gift guides. No candles, no mugs, no luxury pajamas. Scented things give her severe headaches. She is very low maintenance in her day-to-day life, but will dress up for an evening at the casino with my dad. She buys her clothes at Ross, and we always get her a gift card along with her actual wrapped items. I’ve already given her things in the past like makeup, mugs, coffee, heated blankets, slippers, robes, sweatpants, socks, kitchen appliances, chocolate and more…but they’re getting old and repetitive. She doesn’t get her nails done, she’s gotten gift certificates in the past for salons but never uses them. She is not very tech savvy either, so digital frames and other tech gadgets are not for her. She does use an iPad though to play casino games and look on the internet. She definitely will not read books.

I thought about maybe an experience, but she doesn’t like going to the movies, shows, or immersive experiences. If there’s a lot of walking then she won’t enjoy it. She has back and neck pains. She participates in family vacations but sometimes will skip out on specific events. There’s not much to do around here anyway.

I would say that she’s somewhat sentimental, but there’s only so many times that I would like to give her a framed picture or a painting from me. If I make her a “coupon book,” I know she will never take me up on the offers. 

She’s just so hard to buy for, but I want to give her something that she will actually use or find useful. I love my mom so much, and I think she deserves nice things. I just wish it was easier to find something that is more suited to her.

He leans towards the mirror, tilting his head over and back to inspect his work. 

“No,” he sighs disappointedly while massaging his neck and jawline with his fingers, “it’s just not good enough.”  

He then picks up his razer to have one last look at it before throwing it in the bin while shaking his head frustratedly thinking, “there has to be something that actually works.” 

Later as he is walking to the store, he sees an image of a man smiling on a poster with the heading, “want perfection, use only elite for the closest possible shave.” 

He turns toward his reflection on the store window beside him, stares at his reflection for a moment, nods, then walks towards the entrance with a new found purpose in his step. 

Looking through the large variety of shaving utensils in his bag as he walks out the door, he nods confidently believing at least one of those items would work. 

Too Impatient to wait until he gets home, he uses the cafe toilet next to the store to try out his first purchase; the electric razor.  

While spending a substantial amount of time in there, he walks out with a smile on his face, to the disgust of the shocked customers that were listening to worrying vibrating sounds he had been making. 

Feeling like rewarding himself he orders himself a coffee and a slice of cake and sits down. 

He sees a younger man sitting at the table across from him and notices that his stubble is almost none existent, but he is interrupted by the waiter laying out his coffee and cake on the table, 

Picking up the knife that the waiter left he sees his reflection on it which makes him upset and he storms out. 

At home he tries out another item, “elite razer” like the image of the man on the poster he had hoped he would be as satisfied with his shave. 

But he was not. 

Next was the one he was hoping he would not have to use since he was not a barber and never used one, the cut-throat. 

Carefully tilting the blade at an angle like the Youtube video he watched said, he slowly goes over his whole face just praying he doesn’t sneeze. 

Almost 40 minute later he is done with no more than a few minor scratch's on his face. 

Again, he leans in to examine his face, which he seems relatively happy with, but decides to have one more going over just to make sure. 

He couldn’t have been happier with the results, smooth skin without a hair follicle in sight. 

Wanting to show off his masterpiece, he heads to the nearest bar, stopping at every window on the way to admire himself. Too blinded by his own obsession to see his true face despite the horrifying screams of passersby. ",4,1732545480.0,shortscarystories,0,0.84,False

Looking for new earbuds? I've been testing out the OnePlus Buds 3, and they've made quite an impression.

These sleek gray earbuds pack a punch with their sound quality. I was blown away by the deep bass and crisp highs from the dual drivers. The noise cancellation works great too - it adapted well as I moved between different environments. I found the touch controls easy to use, and the comfort level was top-notch even after hours of wear.

https://preview.redd.it/6cjp3stf523e1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48a69d1bb7c01f75b00e6e8010efc109b29f5e0f

The battery life is a standout feature. I went almost two full days of regular use before needing to charge the case. The Audio ID feature let me create a sound profile just for my ears, which was a nice touch. Call quality was clear too, even when I was in a noisy coffee shop.

# Bottom Line

The OnePlus Buds 3 offer great sound, comfort, and battery life. If you want quality earbuds without breaking the bank, these are worth a look. 

# Overview of OnePlus Buds 3

I've been using these Buds for a while now, and they're pretty impressive. The sound quality is good, with deep bass and clear highs. I like how they fit in my ears - comfortable and secure. The noise cancellation works well, blocking out a lot of background noise. Battery life is great too - I can use them for days before needing to charge. The touch controls are easy to use. Call quality is clear, even in noisy places. They come in a nice compact case that's easy to carry around. While they're not perfect, I think the Buds 3 offer good value for the price. They're a solid choice if you want wireless earbuds with good sound and features.

# Immersive Sound Quality

I was blown away by the audio quality of these earbuds. The dual dynamic drivers with 10.4mm woofers and 6mm tweeters deliver rich, deep bass and crisp highs. The BassWave technology adds extra punch to low frequencies without muddying the sound.

I found the OnePlus Audio ID 2.0 feature really cool. It creates a custom sound profile based on my hearing, making everything sound more clear and balanced to my ears. The adaptive noise cancellation works great too, blocking out up to 49dB of background noise.

Call quality is top-notch thanks to the AI Clear Call tech. I was able to have clear conversations even when walking on busy streets. The only minor downside is that the highest frequencies can sometimes sound a bit unclear at max volume.

# Personalization with OnePlus Audio ID 2.0

I was impressed by the Audio ID 2.0 feature on the OnePlus Buds 3. It made my listening experience much better. The buds test my hearing and create a sound profile just for me. This means the music sounds clearer and more balanced to my ears. I noticed more details in my favorite songs that I hadn't heard before. It's easy to set up and only takes a few minutes. The app guides you through some quick hearing tests. Then it adjusts the sound to fit your hearing. I think this is great for people who want their music to sound its best. It's like having a custom EQ without needing to fiddle with settings yourself.

# Adaptive Noise Cancellation

I was really impressed with how well these earbuds blocked out noise. The OnePlus Buds 3 can reduce noise by up to 49dB, which made a big difference in noisy places. I tried them on a busy street and could barely hear traffic. The noise cancellation adapts to your surroundings, so it worked well both indoors and outdoors.

One cool thing is you can adjust the level of noise cancellation. I liked being able to turn it down when I wanted to hear some background noise. The transparency mode also worked great for conversations without taking the earbuds out.

The noise cancellation wasn't perfect though. Very loud, sudden noises still came through sometimes. But for most everyday situations, it did a solid job of creating a quieter listening experience.

# Call Quality with AI Clear Call Technology

I was impressed by the call quality on these buds. The AI Clear Call tech really shines in noisy places. I tested them at a busy coffee shop and my friend could hear me clearly. Background noise was cut down a lot. My voice came through crisp and natural. The mics pick up speech well without being too sensitive. I noticed a big difference compared to my old earbuds. Calls felt much more like talking face-to-face. The buds did a good job blocking wind noise when I was outside too. Overall, the call quality is a strong point for the OnePlus Buds 3.

# Long Battery Life

I was impressed by how long these earbuds last. The OnePlus Buds 3 can play for up to 44 hours with the charging case. This means I can use them for days without needing to plug in. On a single charge, the buds themselves last quite a while too. When I'm out and about, I don't have to worry about running out of power. The case charges up pretty fast - it only takes about 2 hours to get full. For me, this long battery life is a big plus. It makes the Buds 3 great for travel or busy days when I can't stop to charge often.

# Elegant Design and Comfort

I was impressed by how sleek and comfortable these earbuds felt. The OnePlus Buds 3 have a stylish metallic gray finish that looks great. They're shaped to fit snugly in my ears without any pressure or discomfort, even after hours of use. The lightweight design means I barely notice I'm wearing them. I like that they come in two color options to match different styles. The charging case is compact and slides easily into my pocket. While the buds stay securely in place during workouts, they may not be ideal for intense activities. The touch controls work well but take some getting used to. For everyday wear and listening, these earbuds nail the balance of looks and comfort.

# Pros and Cons

These earbuds surprised me with their performance. I've been using them for a while now, and they've become my go-to for daily listening. Let's break down what I found to be good and not-so-good about the OnePlus Buds 3.

# Pros

I've found these earbuds to be a solid choice for everyday use. They strike a good balance between features and price. The sound quality and comfort are the standout points for me. While they're not perfect, the pros outweigh the cons in my experience.

I've been using these OnePlus earbuds for a while now, and I'm impressed with what I've experienced. Many users praise the comfortable fit and natural feel in their ears. The sound quality has surprised a lot of people, with deep bass and clear audio across most frequencies. The active noise cancellation (ANC) works well for most users, though opinions vary slightly on its effectiveness.

Battery life is a big plus, with the case providing long playtime. Connectivity is smooth with various devices. The mic quality for calls is good, and the transparency mode is helpful.

Some minor downsides include:

I recently got my hands on Sony's ULT WEAR headphones, and I'm excited to share my thoughts. These over-ear noise-cancelling Bluetooth headphones pack a punch when it comes to sound quality and features.

The first thing that grabbed my attention was the deep bass. With the ULT button, I can boost the low-end for an extra kick in my music. It's perfect for those tracks where I really want to feel the beat. The noise-cancelling is top-notch too, thanks to its dual system and V1 processor. I found it great for blocking out distractions while I work or travel.

Comfort is key for long listening sessions, and these headphones deliver. The cushions mold to my ears, making them easy to wear for hours. I like that they fold up for easy packing when I'm on the go. The carry case is a nice touch for protection.

I'm also glad Sony used recycled plastic in these headphones. It's nice to see a big company taking steps to be more eco-friendly. The battery life is solid too - I can listen all day without needing to recharge.

# Bottom Line

If you want great sound, strong noise-cancelling, and comfort in your headphones, the Sony ULT WEAR is a solid choice. The deep bass and eco-friendly design are big pluses.

I tried them in a busy coffee shop and could barely hear anything except my music. The ULT WEAR really shines in noisy places. I noticed a big difference compared to my old headphones.

The noise canceling works well for both constant low sounds and sudden loud noises. It made my commute much more peaceful. I could focus on my podcasts without train or traffic noise. At home, it blocked out my noisy neighbors and let me work without distractions.

One small issue is that the strongest noise canceling setting can cause a bit of pressure in your ears. But you can adjust it easily if needed. Overall, I'm really impressed with how well these headphones create a bubble of quiet around you.

# Revolutionary Bass Amplifier

I recently tried out the Sony ULT WEAR headphones and was blown away by the bass. The ULT button is a game-changer, pumping up the low end to new levels. It's perfect for bass-heavy genres like hip-hop and EDM. The sound quality is crisp and clear, with good separation between instruments.

The noise canceling works great too. I used these on a flight and could barely hear the engine noise. The ear cushions are super comfy - I wore them for hours without any discomfort.

Battery life is solid at around 30 hours. I like that a quick 3-minute charge gives 90 minutes of playback in a pinch. The folding design and carry case make these easy to pack for trips.

# Superior Comfort and Fit

I found the ULT WEAR to be really comfy. The ear cushions are soft and adapt to my ears. This is thanks to the thermo-foaming design. I can wear these headphones for hours without any pain. The over-ear style fits well and blocks out noise. They're not too heavy either, which is nice for long listening sessions. The headband has good padding too. It doesn't dig into my head. I like that they fold up for easy storage when I'm not using them. The recycled plastic material feels sturdy but not cheap. Overall, Sony did a great job with the fit and comfort of these headphones.

# Travel Convenience with Swivel Fold Design

I love how easy these headphones are to take on trips. The swivel fold design is really smart. I can fold them up quickly and pop them in my bag. They take up less space this way, which is great when I'm packing light. Sony included a compact carry case too. This keeps the headphones safe when I'm on the go. I've used them on long flights and train rides without any hassle. The folding feature makes them much more portable than some other over-ear options I've tried. It's a small touch, but it makes a big difference for frequent travelers like me.

# Commitment to Eco-Friendliness

I'm impressed by Sony's efforts to make these headphones more environmentally friendly. The ULT WEAR is built using recycled plastic materials, which helps reduce waste and conserve resources. I noticed that even the packaging is plastic-free, showing Sony's dedication to cutting down on single-use plastics. This eco-conscious approach doesn't affect the quality or performance of the headphones at all. It's great to see a big tech company taking steps to lower their environmental impact.

1gzjzk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gzjzk4/how_can_i_find_ways_to_support_my_adhd_partner/,How can I find ways to support my ADHD partner?,"I (23F) have been with my partner (30F) for about two years now. I used to joke about thinking she had ADHD in the beginning of dating, but now more and more her quirks align with ADHD, and I'm struggling to help her feel better.

She is a teacher, and also plays a sport so has very long days, but I almost never hear from her. In the beginning of dating she made tons of time to text me nearly nonstop, but now I can easily not hear from her from 8am when she leaves the house until 6pm on her way home. Often, she tells me she got sucked in to some job at school or had to reply to emails or was chatting to coworkers and just forgot. 

When she is home, our sex life has dropped to non existent in the past 4/5 months and her main interest seems to be her phone. We had sex multiple times a day for the first few months of our relationship, then did long-distance for a year and moved in together over the summer. Now, she tells me she loves me and is attracted to me but doesn't have a huge sex drive anymore.

She is taking a college course and has two essays due next week but hasn't started either. She has known about both of them for months and is getting increasingly worked up and stressed but has yet to sit down and do any of it. She really wants to do it, the same way she wants to go to the gym on weekends or eat healthier, but she really beats herself up over not getting around to it. 

She skews a bit on the negative side, but it often feels like really little things ruin her entire day. For example, we can be having a great day, dancing together and laughing, and her water bottle falling off the nightstand might make her cold and miserable until the next day. She tried therapy once, tried to bring her anger issues up with her therapist, and swore off therapy when the therapist told her that it wasn't an issue (bad therapist). 

My partner can sleep an entire day. Once I left the house at 9am after falling asleep around 2am and she didn't wake up until 6pm. On weekends she can easily sleep until 2 or 3pm and still wake up tired. I have never seen anything like it. If she drinks a coffee she is asleep half an hour later and will need a 2 hour nap to recover. She wakes up guilty and mad at herself.

I've noticed that some of our communication issues might be related to her ADHD. She needs to be right and often focuses on the semantics of my arguments rather than my feelings, arguing that I said twice when I should've said once, etc. I am always the one to suck it up and apologise first, often when I feel the issue hasn't been resolved. She tends to shut down and become extremely distant when she interprets something I've said as judging her.

All of this aside, I absolutely adore my girl. I love her so much and just want to find ways for our relationship to work. I'm willing to do the planning for dates and not set hard time limits as she's always late, and I'm willing to do the cooking and be someone she can come home to and just disappear into her phone to relax for a little. She is overall an excellent partner, although I know I've focused on so many negatives here. She makes me laugh like no one else, she is incredibly loyal and smart, and I admire her drive so much. I do not think she is a bad person or means to hurt me ever. I am just a very anxious person who struggles when these issues happen and she shuts down or can't talk about the future, and I want to get better.

I know ambient noise is common in lofi beats, but here it evolves and shifts with the narrative instead of staying constant.

For example, one track, *Mundane Mornings*, starts with birds chirping, then transitions into sounds of waking up, closing the window (cutting off the birds), brushing teeth, and making coffee—all told through the ambient soundscape.

Other tracks include:

* *Rockstar Lifestyle*
* *Drunken Souls*
* *After Party*

Each track uses evolving ambiance and samples to tell unique stories and create vivid imagery.

What do you think of this approach? Any techniques, tools, or artists you’d recommend exploring to refine this concept? I’d love to hear your feedback!",1,1732544658.0,LofiHipHop,2,1.0,False

Ignore this post if you don't like reading.","Hello! I'm new to reddit \^\^ I've been trying to make friends for a while now, but I haven't been very successful, so I decided to make an account on reddit to try turning my luck around!

I go by Mushie on the internet! As I said on the title, I'm 22 years old, and I'm male. I'm very emotional, and I tend to emphatize a lot with people! Because of that, people tend to say I'm a little feminine, but I'm okay with that \^\^  
This post is long because I don't know how to shorten messages of any kind, unless you're okay with that, please ignore me!

I'm not picky about age and gender, all I ask is that you're mature! I'd gladly get along with you if you are \^\^

I like to play video games a lot, but my main focus is doing research and expanding my knowledge on all kinds of things! I especially love learning how the human mind works \^\^  
Ideally, I'd love to get along with someone just as motivated to learn something new as I am! Having healthy debates with other people is my cup of coffee!

Speaking of coffee, I'm quite a fan of coffee! I haven't really tried many kinds of it, and I tend to just stick to the not-so-yummy coffee pods sold at grocery stores. But nonetheless, I'd like to try new kinds of coffee! Although I have no idea where or how to start ;-;

On a more serious note, I struggle with my mental health, I don't know what I'm diagnosed with other than depression and anxiety, probably because I never finish the diagnosis tests and always refuse to attend any appointments focused on figuring out my diagnosis. On that note, I'd prefer it if judgemental people didn't talk to me! I personally don't care too much if I'm judged by strangers, but I tend to be quite mean to people who aren't nice to me :P

I mentioned above that I'm emotional and very sensitive to other people's feelings. This possibly due to struggling with depression!  
But I like being sensitive, it's part of my personality and it's not something I'm willing to let go of.  
Because of my empathetic nature, I care a lot about other people! Even if they're complete strangers, if they're suffering, I will suffer with them too.  
Of course, the fact that I'm sensitive doesn't mean that I get uncomfortable easily, it's actually very hard to make me uncomfortable on the internet \^\^



I'll end this post here. There's probably more that I can add! But I don't want to make this any longer.  
Please comment or PM me if you're interested in getting along with me! Looking forward to meeting you, regardless of who you are.

I got Corian Quatz countertop in the kitchen. Its about 16 years old.

I am getting a coffee machine that is around 31kg and will be placed on one end of the slab.

Is this safe? Can it hold that weight?

I don't know what to do. Nobody will help me. He is on a couple medications. We tried aba but they were not helpful they said he was manipulative and they made him earn checkmarks to see me again which I was not comfortable with. Lately, I have been keeping him on a wrist leash as I go about my day so I can keep him by me and keep him out of trouble. He is not interested in anything besides destroying the house. I have tried as well as aba,ot,speech therapists and teachers have not been able to get him focused on anything. He is just very busy. I feel bad because it is not his fault but I have no support. I have a toddler at home too. If something is in arm reach he will grab and destroy as well as go out the doors. I have hotel chains on the top but he knows how to undo them. Time outs do not work and he doesn't care about toys or electronics so I can not really take anything away from him. I want to find a way to keep him in my home. He does not qualify for much support in home. If we get this waiver we are trying for he will qualify for 10 hours of respite per week but I was hoping for round the clock help. He is on risperidone and guanfacine. I'm typing this while he is on a leash by me trying to spit on me and punching himself in the face laughing(low intensity it is a stim). This is 24 7. It never stops. I'm exhausted and can't do this anymore. I have no support. He has been up since 2am as usual. I have nowhere I can even go to get a break. The school won't take him more than 2 hours because they can't handle him either. My parents can't handle him. Can't do daycare or a babysitter. Because he is verbal, potty trained, and has some good self care skills he does not qualify for much respite if he even does qualify for that waiver at all. I feel like a horrible mom for having him on a leash. I am tired of chasing him. He puts hid head through the drywall, turns on oven burners, climbs counters, puts stuff up his butt, tries to swallow objects, opens the oven, puts stuff in the dryer, flushes things down the toilet, sticks stuff in outlets, goes out the frontdoor, All day. Over and over. Two teachers have called him manic but when I talk to doctors they just say no inappropriate laughter is common in autism. But he does it from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed. Has anyone experienced anything similar? I have swings, crash pad, trampoline, sensory bins, play doh, vibration plate, walking pad...he's too scared to go outside or play at the park or anything like that to burn off energy. Any ideas to keep him busy? Something just seems wrong. Their are other kids with autism in his class and something just seems different. The ot, speech therapist, and personal therapist I had who specialized in autism(i picked her so she can help me with some parenting stuff)he was 3 thought it was pointless to get him evaluated and that he definitely does not have autism because he pretend plays, has good joint attention, and makes appropriate eye contact. He turns out to be labeled as ""severe autism"" which the doctor who evaluated him said he did not present typically for autism but that's she believes this label will help him get the support he clearly needs. But I feel like something is wrong and nobody will help me. I have no clue what I can do to help him. I want him to remain in home but I feel I am not meeting his needs. I dont even think he qualifys for residential care anyway. Because when they test him and see his skills if he is calm they say just behvaioral. But it is out of his control. What do I do?

Add:
I should add he is on a leash like 10 minutes at a time so I can drink coffee or do dishes or laundry...or go to the bathroom. It's like my break. I drink my coffee by his trampoline and he will jump on it while saying ""I want to come out"" Haha. I'm like yes yes let me finish my coffee and the mayhem can resume. But hes smart so he's like oh yeah I'll show you a break...spit...ha",1,1732544295.0,Autism_Parenting,5,1.0,False

Example guides that show this:

My question: these guides are showing that the coil with the larger resistance is the “primary” coil; is this right?

I looked and I was pretty sure he was an iconic actor who was frequently cast as villains/anti-heroes in movies when I was a kid (early-90s).

Couldn’t quite remember his name, so I googled it, and somehow Google gave me a slightly wrong name (a few consonants were misplaced).

I also don’t want to be the type to harass celebrities in public, and I’ve never really encountered a celebrity before, so I kind of let it go, but 5 minutes later, having left the shop, we bumped into him again on the street. 

It was my one opportunity, so I’m like, “Sorry, but are you by any chance _________?”

He got really confused, and he was like, “uh, no. It’s [correct last name.]” 

I was so nervous though it didn’t register that he was being nice and trying to tell me his actual last name. 

He was never anything but nice, but I was so intimidated that the rest of the interaction went about as well as could be expected.
