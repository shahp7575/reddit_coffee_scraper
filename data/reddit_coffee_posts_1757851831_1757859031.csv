The owner was genuinely nice - flexible on times, free coffee, took an interest in why I was there, helped me out with local stuff/transport etc.

Problem was the place simply wasn't clean - stuck-on stains all over cutlery/plates etc / bits of food and waste just left on surfaces/floor for hours/days / dog hair, dust and clutter absolutely everywhere. Some of the facilities (microwave, washing machine etc.) were simply too unclean for me to feel comfortable using them. 

The owner seems a bit of a recluse and I assume has simply gotten used to this over the years, so I feel bad leaving a bad review, however the blunt fact is that there is no way I would ever stay there again and feel it is fair to alert other stayers of this in some way.

1ngs7mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/msnbc/comments/1ngs7mi/the_hierarchy_of_televised_tragedy_or_why_dead/,"The Hierarchy of Televised Tragedy, or: Why Dead Children Apparently Don’t Rate","I have developed what can only be described as a compulsive channel-changing disorder, specific to MSNBC and specific to this week. It’s become this ritual: I’ll be folding laundry or making coffee, and I’ll think, surely by now they’re covering Trump’s troop deployments, or those Epstein files that were supposedly so urgent, or this Venezuela business that keeps getting whispered about in increasingly hysterical tones. So I’ll reach for the remote with the kind of optimism typically reserved for lottery tickets, convinced that this time will be different.

And every single time it’s Charlie Kirk. More Charlie Kirk. Nothing but Charlie Kirk.

Don’t misunderstand me. Political assassinations are serious business. When someone gets shot for their political beliefs, that’s news. That’s democracy under threat. But Charlie Kirk has now received more sustained television analysis than the systematic dismantling of the federal government, and I’m starting to wonder if MSNBC has confused tragedy with journalism. 

Because here’s what’s making me feel like I’m taking crazy pills: On the very same day Charlie Kirk was killed in Utah, a sixteen year old walked into his Colorado high school with a revolver and shot two classmates before killing himself. This child had been posting Nazi imagery online and planning the attack for months. Two teenagers were wounded. A minor is dead from the same gun violence that’s been plaguing American schools for decades.

And how much sustained coverage has this received? Not even a half day of coverage before we all collectively moved on. Meanwhile, we’re now on hour seventy eight of Charlie Kirk assassination analysis, complete with panels of experts discussing the psychological implications of his Twitter followers and the architectural significance of Utah Valley University.

I keep expecting to turn on the television and find some acknowledgment that other things are happening in America. That democracy might be worth discussing. That children getting shot in schools might merit the kind of sustained attention we’re devoting to one man’s death. Instead, I get more Charlie Kirk, as if the entire universe of American political discourse has contracted to this single, admittedly tragic, but ultimately singular event.

It’s like being trapped in some kind of media purgatory where actual governance has been replaced by grief performance art. And honestly? I’m starting to miss the days when cable news at least pretended to cover multiple stories in a single day.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1757858825.0,msnbc,1,1.0,False

Been emotional and hard. Now it feels like I'm stuck I don't know how to leave I have abandonment issues and I do love him but he treats me terribly which has also developed into extreme health anxiety for me. 

He is abusive is all forms he has isolated me made me not have friends anymore he took away my little joys I had one being the gym which was my daily ritual for myself and going to a coffee shop. He doesn't want me to go anywhere without him or he thinks I'm cheating it's gotten to the point I can't even dress nice to go out without him or even put on makeup so I look like a slob all the time. He always thinks I'm cheating or he gets jealous if there is any good Looking guy around that I have to constantly look down or he harasses me non stop as to why I'm checking people out when I don't. Even when it comes to my health anxiety he thinks I'm trying to meet a doctor and flirt.

We went on a family trip and he tried to make me look so bad in front of his family at one point during the trip they all were sort of mad at me I felt on that trip. when we would go back to our room I dreaded it because he would blow up at me and get in my face eventually he was hitting my rib and choking me even tried to throw my purse at me and broke the tv. In the morning he didn't care how I was he cared more about the tv being broken and got upset with me all over again. He has ruined my house he has been physically abusive and psychologically emotionally too.

 he went to law school and the level of manipulation and gaslighting he is a pro at he will make you admit to anything even if you didn't do it which is also so scary about him. Moving onto now I've been so loyal and honest with him that I've grown a lot of resentment for how he treats me I don't even go out anymore I'm always home so he doesn't get mad. 

Also he used work from home but now is going to the office a little more I've been thinking about going to the gym again while he's at work but if he knew he would get so angry and upset saying I want attention when I just miss it for my mental. Do I go and do what I find joy in and not tell him? I struggle with this because I am an honest person and don't want to hide anything but it's gotten to the point where it never gets valued and I myself am not valued.

Expert Insights, Practical Guidance, and 2025 Updates\
\
Alt text: Professional business meeting among corporate professionals in Bahrain., and the unique blend of modernity and heritage: Bahrain business is unlike anywhere else. I’ve registered companies in the bustling Diplomatic Area and navigated early morning queues at the MOICT, sipping on strong qahwa while reviewing shareholder documents. My journey taught me something invaluable: understanding the details—such as the maximum number of shareholders for a WLL—can make or break your startup ambitions in Bahrain’s vibrant economy.*\
\
Bahrain’s Dynamic Business Landscape in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting in Bahrain. and Reuters, the Kingdom saw a 7.3% growth in new commercial registrations in Q1 2025, the strongest since 2018. Sijilat data shows over 4,800 new businesses launched between January and April this year—nearly half led by foreign investors. Free zones in Bahrain, from Bahrain Bay to the up-and-coming spaces near Amwaj Islands, now offer streamlined setup for 100% foreign-owned entities (see how).\
Economically, Bahrain remains the Gulf’s underdog. While nearby UAE and Saudi Arabia dominate headlines, Bahrain’s pro-business reforms (like those from Tamkeen and the EDB) give startups lower costs and more agility. The 2025 Commercial Companies Law Update (effective March 1st) now allows foreign shareholders in even more business activities, expanding the spectrum for WLL setups.\
\
Did you know?\
Bahrain’s market entry time averages 4-7 working days for a WLL, beating Dubai’s average of two weeks.\
\

\
Answering The Big Question: Shareholder Limits for a WLL (With Local Context)\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration among corporate professionals.** is the go-to structure for businesses wanting flexibility, local credibility, and limited liability protection. Officially called ""شركة ذات مسؤولية محدودة"" in Arabic, the WLL is equivalent to a Limited Liability Company.\
The Legal Shareholder Range:\
As per the 2025 Bahrain Commercial Companies Law update:\
\
Minimum shareholders: 2\
Maximum shareholders: 50\
\
No more, no less. This rule is strictly enforced through Sijilat (the Ministry’s online portal) and the MOICT. If you try to add a 51st shareholder, your application will be instantly flagged (I’ve seen a client’s process stuck for three weeks over this).\
Why the Limit?\
The intent: Protect the company’s “private” status and avoid the stricter rules that apply to Public Joint Stock Companies (BSCs). For partnerships, different rules apply (see types of business entities), but for a WLL, this two-to-fifty shareholder cap is sacrosanct.\
\
Tip: If you anticipate needing more than 50 stakeholders, explore a BSC or alternative arrangements.\
\
Practical Example\
A tech startup in Bahrain Bay wanted to bring in 60 angel investors. My advice (and the only legal route): pool individual investments via a holding company or convert to a BSC. Their initial attempt to “split” shares across nominees hit a compliance brick wall.\
Ownership: Bahraini, GCC, or International\
Bahrain leads the region for foreign investment openness.\
- Foreigners can own up to 100% in over 95% of commercial activities (full list here).\
- No Bahraini partner is needed for many tech, consulting, and trading activities.\
- Local sponsors are only required for specific restricted sectors (see sponsorship guide).\
\
Bahrain WLL: Costs & Budgeting (With Insider Figures)\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company formation.:\
\
MOICT Registration: BHD 200 - 300\
CR (Commercial Registration) Fees: BHD 50 - 100 (annual renewal)\
Municipality Fees: BHD 50 - 250\
Virtual/Co-working Office Lease: BHD 35 - 60/month for top business districts (Seef, Diplomatic Area, Bahrain Bay)\
Professional Service Provider (optional for time-saving): BHD 400 - 1200\
Share Capital: Minimum BHD 20 (for most activities; can be BHD 1,000+ for regulated activities)\
\
\
Budget Tip: Use the Keylink Bahrain Company Formation Cost Calculator for an instant estimate.\
\
Real-World Example—What I Paid:\
My most recent formation (consulting WLL, 3 shareholders) in 2025:\
- Total upfront: BHD 610 (including MOICT, CR, and desk)\
- Annual renewal: BHD 83\
Major cost-saver: Timing the application just after Ramadan meant fewer applicants, no queues at MOICT, and faster approvals.\
\
Step-By-Step: Setting Up a WLL & Time/Money Saving Insider Tips\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation in Bahrain office.:\
1. Choose the Right Business District\
\
Seef District: Quickest approvals, best virtual office options\
Bahrain Bay: Premium address, useful for tech/fintech\
Diplomatic Area: Banking, finance, consulting focus\
\
Pro Tip: Offices in Bahrain World Trade Center offer express CR processing (staff are well-versed with foreign applications).\
2. Prepare Documents Early\
Required docs (for all shareholders):\
- Passport copies (color scanned, signed)\
- CPR (ID) for Bahrainis/GCC\
- Proof of address\
- Draft M&AA (Articles of Association, in Arabic & English)\
- Proof of capital deposit (may be needed for some sectors)\
Shortcuts:\
- Use the Sijilat online template for M&AA—no need for a custom legal draft unless your structure is complex.\
- Schedule notarization appointments before submitting your application—midweek mornings (10–11 am) at the Ministry’s Diplomatic Area office = zero queues.\
3. Optimal Application Timing\
Avoid:\
- First week of January (post-holiday backlog)\
- Last week of Ramadan (reduced working hours, everyone’s distracted by Eid prep)\
Best window:\
- First half of May or October; staff are refreshed, system downtime is rare.\
4. Submission & Approvals\
\
Apply online using Sijilat portal\
Attach all docs as PDFs—under 5MB each\
Pay MOICT registration online\
\
Insider Note:\
- Having a local PRO or experienced consultant can cut approval time in half. I once saw an application with an error (wrong spelling of a shareholder’s name) delayed over three weeks until a PRO fixed it in person at Sijilat.\
5. Post-Formation Uses & Compliance\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain companies.\
- Register for LMRA (if hiring staff)\
- Open local bank account (banks love licensed offices in Seef and Bahrain Bay)\
- Keep up with annual filings (easy with a local accounting service)\
Majlis-style meetings: It’s common for shareholders to hold informal “majlis” meetings at a founder’s diwaniya, discussing strategy over traditional coffee and sweets. Such gatherings help strengthen trust—something you won’t see in Dubai or Riyadh’s more formal settings.\
\
Compliance, Governance & Mistake Prevention\
Mistake I See Often:\
Many newcomers forget that each shareholder (even if based abroad) must provide full KYC, sign the M&AA in person or via certified Power of Attorney, and fulfill capital deposit requirements.\
And a little tangent—a surprising number of founders assume they can “rotate” shareholder lists during approvals, thinking to sidestep the 50-person cap. Bahrain’s Sijilat system tracks every submission with a national ID and passport check; don’t risk blacklisting.\
Best strategy:\
Appoint one local director familiar with Bahrain’s business etiquette. I once had a startup delayed by two months due to a shareholder traveling during Ramadan—a local director smoothed the process with rapid in-person signings. For complex cases, Keylink’s support is invaluable.\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE/Saudi Arabia: WLL Structure Comparison\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration UAE Saudi Bahrain comparison..\
Conclusion: Bahrain wins for flexibility, speed, and cost—especially for foreign founders.\
\
2025 Regulatory Update: The New Shareholder Verification Law\
Importantly, from March 2025, all new WLLs must submit real-time shareholder verification through Sijilat’s partnership with LMRA. No more post-formation KYC delays. The immediate effect: faster bank account openings and less risk of criminal liability for hidden UBOs (Ultimate Beneficial Owners).\
I tested the system during its first week: my client’s approval came in 36 hours—record time.\
\
Trusted Resources & Service Providers\
I always recommend Keylink for expats and small teams; they know every government official by name (and their favorite qahwa blends). Tamkeen’s startup grants in 2025 cover registration and even first-year office rent for new WLLs in certain categories.\

\
Frequently Asked Questions: WLL Shareholders & Bahrain Company Formation\
1. Can a WLL be owned by one person?\
No. Bahrain’s WLL requires a minimum of two shareholders. If you’re solo, a Single Person Company (SPC) might suit you better—learn more here.\
2. Is 100% foreign ownership allowed in a Bahrain WLL?\
Yes, for almost all sectors except a few restricted activities. Check the comprehensive guide.\
3. What documents are required for each shareholder?\
\
Passport & CPR (if GCC/Bahrain)\
Proof of address\
Notarized signature\
Power of Attorney (if signing remotely)\
\
Prepare these ahead of time to avoid delays; see the full checklist.\
4. How much does it really cost to set up a WLL?\
\
BHD 350–900 if you DIY\
BHD 850–1,600 with full service provider support\
Estimate your cost instantly with this calculator.\
\
5. What’s the most common mistake with the shareholder limit?\
Trying to circumvent the 50-person cap—or having incomplete KYC for one or more shareholders. Solution: Limit your group to 50, prep all docs, and use a professional service for peace of mind (book support).\
\
Ready to launch a WLL in Bahrain—fast?\
Choose the right partners, time your application well, and keep your shareholder list smart. Bahrain’s business doors are wide open—and there’s no better time to join the Kingdom’s thriving entrepreneurial community.\

1ngs60v,https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/1ngs60v/i_challenge_you_to_be_twice_as_good/,I challenge you to be twice as good,"Change the narrative. If you spend one minute complaining about politics or the state of the world, spend two minutes sharing something positive. If you post one word sentence something down, post two sentences offering a solution. Instead of 10 minutes watching the news, spend 20 minutes researching solutions.

We already know the world has problems. What we don’t have enough of is people doing things  that actually work to make things better.

Here are some things you can actually do:

* Vote in local elections. Your county sheriff, mayor, prosecutors, judges, and school board members shape our daily lives much more than the president ever will.
* Block those fake accounts or hit the “x” button when Facebook serves you a clickbait news article. That tells Facebook you’re not falling for their shite anymore, and it stops rewarding garbage content.
* Volunteer a few hours a month. It builds safer, stronger communities. Before you say you don’t have time, think of how much time you spend scrolling through FB feeds or Reddit subs
* Show up to city council or school board meetings. Leaders pay attention to who’s in the room.
* Go outside and pick up trash. Cleaner neighborhoods just look better and help people feel safer.
* Walk or bike in your neighborhood. Safer streets and healthier communities follow when people are outside together.
* Share positive news and real solutions twice as often as you complain. That’s how you flip the narrative.
* If everyone skipped one meal out a month and donated that money to their favorite cause, those organizations wouldn’t need to worry about losing their funding through political whims. With what most people spend on coffee from a drive through, WVXU wouldn’t need to play Cincinnati Edition 10 times a week.
* Stop perpetuating the Us vs Them mentality. Ask someone you disagree with to sit down and have a conversation that isn’t about politics. Treat them like a human being, not an enemy.

Stop adding to the noise. Be the person who offers ideas, encouragement, and proven solutions. Negativity is easy. Positivity backed by action is harder.  
  
I challenge you to be twice as good.  
Start here.  
Instead of replying with a complaint or talking about how bad things are, share what you are going to do to make your part of the world a little better.

I work remotely from my hometown(CCU) I did my master's from UP. I had a nice bunch of people to hangout with even though I happen to be an ambivert, but in my hometown I have 0 friends left, either they are too busy for me or have moved out for work. I have been working since July and today was the day I planned to just f it and take myself out on a solo date for some nice coffee. 
Luck so bad it rained the whole day. I was gonna go to a south Indian joint and have some great filter coffee. I will be forced to slave away for my job again from tomorrow. This pattern of something last minute ruining my plans have been there since long ago. Whenever I try to plan something, it gets ruined one way or another.

I return to this list to compare the metrics when there is hype around a tech stock. Like SNPS right now.  
  
I ranked my favorite stocks out of this list based on certain metrics. X > Y means X is more favorable than Y according to my subjective perspective.



I didn’t include any numbers, purposefully and deliberately. Two reasons. 

One, people focus on numbers too much and miss the main idea. 

Two, sometimes there is no single number. Say, average revenue growth of Company A is 20% in last year, 15% in last three years and 10% in last five years. For Company B, same average growth rates are 20%, 19%, 18%. In such a case, I favor B over A as its growth is more reliable.



Consider it a coffee-break analysis. 



**Revenue Growth over 5 years:** 

Nemetschek SE > Cadence > Altium > Ansys > Autodesk > PTC > Bentley > SAP SE > Oracle

  
  
**Net Margin over 5 years:**

Altium > Ansys > Cadence > Oracle > Synopsys > Trimble > Taylor Devices > Dassault S. > PTC >  Nemetschek SE > Autodesk > SAP SE



**Net Income Growth over 5 years:**

Synopsys > Siemens AG > Oracle > SAP SE > Altium > Accenture 



**Current Ratio & Quick Ratio, Current:**

Altium > Ansys > Cadence > Oracle > Synopsys > Trimble > Taylor Devices



**Debt-to-Equity & Debt-to-Equity Long Term, Current:**

Taylor Devices > Ansys > Aspen > Cadence > Altium > Cybernet



**Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) & Return on Invested Capital, Normalized, Current:**

Accenture > Autodesk > Altium > Cadence > Nemetschek SE > Taylor Devices > Rockwell > SAP SE > PTC



**Free Cash Flow per Revenue (FCF / Rev) over 5 years:**

Aspen > Ansys > Autodesk > PTC > Cadence > Bentley S. > Dassault S. > Altium



These are some major metrics I check to evaluate the performance of a company. By now I expect you to have some idea which ones perform better than others. Clearly there is no single answer, the ranking depends on your priorities.

Now let’s evaluate the price. 



**Price-to-Earnings (PE) & PE, Normalized & PE, Forward:**

Capgemini SE > Taylor Devices > Accenture > Siemens AG > Cybernet > Ansys > PTC > Synopsys > Autodesk > Aspen > SAP SE > Oracle > Bentley S. > Trimble > Cadence > Altium > Nemetschek SE



**Price-to-Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) & PEG, Normalized & PEG, Forward:**

Taylor Devices > Cybernet > Capgemini SE > Dassault S. > Accenture > Synopsys > Autodesk > PTC > Siemens AG > Ansys > Bentley S. > Aspen > Trimble > Oracle > Nemetschek SE > Altium > Cadence

Capgemini SE > Cybernet > Accenture > Siemens AG > Taylor Devices > Rockwell > Trimble > Dassault S. > SAP SE > PTC > Synopsys > Autodesk > Bentley > Ansys > Oracle > Aspen > Nemetschek SE > Cadence > Altium



**Price-to-Cash Flow:**

Capgemini SE > Accenture > Taylor Devices > Cybernet > Siemens AG > Dassaults S. > Autodesk > PTC > SAP > Ansys > Aspen > BSY > Cadence > Nemetschek SE > Altium



**My conclusion:**

Price metrics are dominated by Capgemini SE, Accenture , Taylor Devices, Cybernet, Siemens AG. Easily explained because:  
1) Non-US stocks are cheaper  
2) Micro-cap stocks are cheaper

So maybe I should look for “a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price.”

Looking at performance metrics, Altium, Ansys, Cadence lead. Yet, their prices reflect the confidence in these businesses.

**Closure:**

Why did I post it here? I am not sure which one is the best stock to buy right now. There is definitely a sweet spot for performance and price. I doubt it is SNPS. I need your ideas and feedback before pulling the trigger. 

Always keep in mind, past performance does not guarantee future success.

I had to rewrite it from memory while also trying to get the correct measurements for just one pan, but this should 

Tiramisu filling:


1.5 lbs Mascarpone cheese (about 3 packages) at room temp

2 cups Powdered Sugar (you can use regular, but powdered gives it more stability). If using granulated sugar, knock it down to 1.5 cups. 

6 Egg yolks at room temp 

2 tsp Vanilla 

2 cups heavy cream

Lady Fingers (about 2 whole packages)


Soak:

1.5-2 cups freshly brewed espresso (I usually get mine from a coffee shop, but you can use your own). 

2 tbsp Rum or Kahlúa (optional if kids are eating it)

Topping: 

Cocoa powder
Fine mesh sieve is needed for dusting the top. 

——————————————————

In a mixer with a paddle attachment (a hand mixer), beat the mascarpone cheese for a few minutes til it’s smooth and fluffy. Add sugar in small quantities, beating well between each addition. Be sure to occasionally scrape the bowl. 

Add the egg yolks one by one mixing well each time, then add the vanilla. Slowly pour in heavy cream while the mixer is running on low. Be sure to scrape down the bowl occasionally. Once it’s all in, let it mix until fully incorporated. It will be should thick, but still liquidy. If it is still thick but needs more liquid, add about another cup of heavy cream. 

If using a stand mixer, switch over to a whisk attachment and begin beating it on medium high. It will go from a thick liquid to a whipped, spreadable texture. It should hold its shape when the mixer is stopped. If it doesn’t, it needs to be whipped more. 

The lady fingers you can soak one of two ways. Either lay them in a single layer in the pan and pour about 1.5-2 tsp of liquid on each one. Be careful not to over soak, these retain liquid very easily. You’re better off under soaking it a bit than having a soggy mess. 

Or you can dip each lady finger in the soak mix taking care to leave it no longer than 2 seconds in the liquid. Seriously, don’t overthink it. 

Assembly:

Lay out the bottom layer of lady fingers into a standard rectangular cake pan using the soaking method of your choice. 

Spread an even layer of the mascarpone mix evenly over the top. Use enough so that you can’t see the lady fingers, but don’t use too much past that. 

Add another layer of soaked lady fingers. Spread the rest of the mascarpone filling over them in an even layer. 

Get the sieve/fine mesh strainer and use a spoon to add cocoa powder to it, probably about 3-4 spoonfuls  

Position the sieve over the pan and lightly tap the side with your hand. Do this until there is an even layer of cocoa powder on top. You shouldn’t be able to see the custard, but you don’t want to use much more past that as it can be overpowering. 

Lightly cover the pan (you can tent some aluminum foil as to not disturb the top) Let it chill overnight and serve the next day, it should keep for about 3-4 days, but better eaten as fresh as possible. Clean the knife between each cut if you want a cleaner slice.

1ngs0rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ngs0rv/unsteadiness_triggers/,Unsteadiness triggers?,"Hello fellow panicked ones, 
Firstly, does anyone suffer with a feeling of unsteadiness/walking on a boat type sensation. (My balance is actually great it just feels off) 

Mine started years ago - I was really hungover (I don’t drink anymore) I was stood outside a coffee shop, someone walked past me and I felt the concrete slab I was stood on move beneath my feet. When I looked down there was no concrete slab, it was tarmac. It freaked me out so bad 🤣

Since then I’ve had repeat episodes, but also episodes of feeling like I’m walking on a boat/unsteadiness. It’s so much more noticeable if I’m actually anxious or stressed.

I think it all stems from hyper awareness, I’m always fixated on how I feel and any baseline change if even 1% sends me into full blown panic. 

If I have the sensation, running, exercising, dancing etc can get rid of it, but it returns when I stop and I’ve had long periods 6-12 months of being symptom free and eventually it returns.

I’ve noticed it can be heavily influenced by lighting/sound. 

Any one experience anything similar?",2,1757858341.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

The APEC FILTER-MAX-ES50 Replacement Filter set is compact yet durable. Surprising for a water filtration system, it fits easily under most sinks without taking up much space. I was initially skeptical about its weight, given it clocks in at just 3.5 pounds, but boy, did it feel solid and well-made once installed. The simple white exterior blends seamlessly with various kitchen décor styles, making it visually unintrusive. The manufacturer boasts its NSF certification, ensuring safety and quality standards, which I found reassuring for a product handling my drinking water. 

**Installation Experience**

Never did I think I would install a water filtration replacement myself, but here we are. The INSTALLATION was a breeze—everything about this set is beginner-friendly. No fancy tools were required, and the instructions were as clear as mountain air. Even my less-than-handy neighbor could set it up. The quick connects and marked filters help alleviate any confusion. Honestly, I was finished replacing the old filters in less than 30 minutes. As someone who has fumbled with overly complicated products before, this was a pleasant surprise.  

Find the best price for [APEC FILTER-MAX-ES50](https://usedwater.com/price/b00i5wso8a/) on Amazon.

**Performance and Filtration Quality**

Right from the first use, the difference was noticeable. The FILTER-MAX-ES50 system has a 5-stage filtration process, which is its main selling point. It starts with a sediment filter, followed by two carbon block filters to remove chlorine, taste, and odor (thankfully saying goodbye to that awful chlorine stink). Then comes the 50 GPD reverse osmosis membrane that tackles contaminants like arsenic, lead, and fluoride. Finally, the set concludes with a coconut-shell carbon filter for refinement. The water tastes clean—almost like it was bottled straight from a glacier. What’s more, my daily coffee tastes better with every sip—crisp and free of any unwanted flavors.

**Positives**

- Easy user-friendly installation process  
- Noticeable improvement in water taste and cleanliness  
- Removes harmful contaminants like lead, arsenic, and PFAS  
- Durable material and NSF-certified quality  
- Compact design fits snugly under the sink  

**Caveats**

- Regular maintenance required every 6 months; membrane lasts longer though  
- Initial system flush wastes a bit of water  

**Performance Longevity**

Just as the manufacturer claims, most of the filters need replacement only after six months of use in an average household. I’ve been running these for three months, and I haven’t noticed any drop in water quality yet. The RO membrane lasts longer—up to 2–4 years—which makes life easier and ultimately reduces the long-term cost. Replacement reminders could’ve been a welcome addition.

**Market Rivals**

The water filtration industry is not short of competition. Some popular brands like iSpring and AquaTru caught my attention, but their systems seemed to be either bulkier or pricier than this product. The compact nature of the FILTER-MAX-ES50 set stood out for me. Compared to the more high-end filters, this one does not come with fancy digital indicators or extra accessories, but in terms of pure filtration performance, it’s an equal competitor. While systems like Brita or PUR are cost-efficient, they simply don’t go as deep in filtration as reverse osmosis systems like this one.

**Quality for Price**

Whether the FILTER-MAX-ES50 delivers bang for the buck depends on what you’re prioritizing. If you’re after comprehensive removal of TDS, arsenic, and drug residues while also improving the flavor profile, then this is a real winner. Despite the absence of smart features, it delivers core functionality with a straightforward design. For families serious about quality drinking water without diving into a convoluted setup, this replacement filter pack is worth every penny.

1ngrw1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1ngrw1k/reveal_the_best_countertop_blender_blendtec/,Reveal the Best Countertop Blender Blendtec Connoisseur 825 Review,"Testing out the Blendtec Connoisseur 825 daily has been nothing short of a unique experience. With so many blenders on the market, it’s easy to dismiss claims of superior power and functionality as marketing fluff, but this machine takes a bold step toward proving those claims true. Designed with noise reduction in mind, it immediately caught my attention due to its sound enclosure. Living in an open-plan apartment where a noisy blender can mean the death of morning coffee peace or quiet Saturday mornings, I was thrilled to test whether it indeed lived up to its promises. Spoiler: the experience was a pleasant surprise.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the first thing I noticed was how robust the blender feels. Its black finish is sleek and professional-looking, but the design isn’t just for aesthetics. At 16 pounds, it’s not a featherweight appliance, but that weight works in its favor, offering stability during use. Its dimensions, 9.4 x 9.4 x 13.4 inches, make it compact enough to fit on my already overcrowded counter without feeling like it’s taking over my kitchen.

Having two WildSide+ jars included was a huge plus. These are BPA-free, generously sized, and feature an extra-wide base paired with a unique “wild” fifth side for a smoother blend. Their 90-ounce volume (36 ounces of actual blending capacity) has been a lifesaver on busy cooking days when preparing larger quantities was necessary. I also love the dull blade, which is stated to be 10x stronger than competitor blades. No sharp edges mean easier cleaning and no worry about accidental mishaps. 

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Operating the Blendtec Connoisseur 825 is an experience of its own, thanks to its 42 pre-programmed cycles. Every button on the interface seemed designed with convenience in mind. Testing everything from smoothies to soups, it became apparent that I didn’t have to babysit the blender—it knows when to stop automatically at the desired consistency. I can imagine this feature being a game-changer for someone running a high-volume shop or even a chaotic household like mine.

One thing to note is how easy it is to experiment with recipes. From hummus to cappuccinos, this blender has handled everything I've thrown at it, thanks to a pulse function that allows extra blending control. Downloadable customization tools take the flexibility a step further, providing options to create cycles tailored to personal recipes.

**Positives**  
- Patented stainless-steel blade, 80% thicker for powerful blending  
- Oversized WildSide+ jar ensures smoother blends for larger recipes  
- Noise enclosure makes the blender surprisingly quiet  
- 42 pre-programmed cycles, with the ability to customize settings for unique recipes  
- Durable build and high power (1,800 watts), easily tackling tough ingredients  

[Check Blendtec Connoisseur 825 price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b00yz5cqsu/)  

**Performance and Noise**  
Over the weeks, the standout feature has been its sound enclosure. While I would never claim this is whisper-quiet, I’d say the difference compared to standard blenders is impressive. I blended frozen fruit and ice right next to my sleepy toddler, and they didn’t even flinch. That’s a win in my parenting book. The power of this product, especially with its 1,800-watt motor, didn’t compromise its noise level either, even during the most demanding blending tasks. 

Whether you’re making post-workout shakes or whipping up a quick soup, the cycles finish in record time. Test after test, it powered through frozen bananas as effortlessly as it processed softer ingredients, such as spinach, for green smoothies. Only occasionally did I feel the need to use the pulse feature to adjust textures.

**Disadvantages**  
- The interface, though powerful, might feel overwhelming for basic users  
- Not the most budget-friendly option for casual users  
- Quite heavy (16 pounds), limiting portability for moving between spaces  
- The jars, while impactful, require significant counter or cupboard space  

**Alternative Offerings**  
While testing this blender, I couldn’t help but compare it to other competitors like the Vitamix 750 and Ninja Foodi Cold & Hot blender. Both are well-known heavyweights in the blending industry and have garnered loyal followings for valid reasons. Comparing each feature, Vitamix excels in offering simple manual controls but falls slightly short in noise reduction. Ninja provides a very competitive price, but its durability and motor power don’t quite match Blendtec’s industrial-level efficiency.

The WildSide+ jar is one area where the Blendtec blender clearly surpassed rivals. It genuinely reduces blending time while delivering smoother consistency. While the Vitamix matches professional vibes with its reliability, Blendtec goes a step further, making it friendlier for high-noise environments, thanks to its sound-blocking technology.

**Best Value**  
Assessing the price-to-quality ratio, the Blendtec Connoisseur 825 starts feeling like an investment rather than a mere kitchen purchase. You get significantly advanced features designed for professional environments (or high-demand home usage), which isn’t something other blenders in this space are offering easily. If versatility, rugged design, and excellent performance are at the top of your checklist, this product checks all the right boxes.

My sister in law (F30) is lefty. 

After many stressful and awkward meetings, my husband decided to go low contact with my brother (M29) and SL. So I meet them on my own.

Every time we hung out she wanted to discuss politics and world views, I refuse to engage in this conversations because from previous experiences I know we don’t agree and that’s ok but she always tries to convince me or label me. Many times she was also disrespectful towards my husband and I always let it go. 

But then…

I was out with my brother and SL for a coffee and she again this happened. I tried to establish my boundaries and mentioned many times for us to drop those topics but she wouldn’t until there was this awkward silence. After that I decided and talked to my brother that I would limit contact with his girlfriend and would prefer to meet alone(we see each other once or twice a month). He agreed and even mentioned that she can be very intense, he said it’s just the way she is. 
Today my brother and I went for a coffee and I needed an umbrella, he went to their place to get it and I waited outside.
Now I’m home and I got a text from him saying his girlfriend is very hurt that I didn’t go inside. He told me this in confidence and asked me to text her some hair tips that she wants from me so that she doesn’t feel like I don’t like her. He also said she’s moping there and giving him a hard time about this. 
Now I don’t know if I’m in the wrong. I want to keep my boundaries but I’m afraid that this will break us apart. Should I just pretend everything is normal and text her? Should I text her I’m low contact with her? I don’t know what to do. 
I’m sorry if it’s confusing, I am a terrible writer.

I’m 29M, with 26F","I’ve been with this girl for about a year and a half. It seems she tries to control me, in subtle ways. Feels like I can’t do anything right. 

Yesterday we went to a fundraiser (sitting outside, on bleachers, watching a softball game) I had a cup of coffee in a glass jug and she told me not to bring the coffee with me (other people just had open beers; I don’t drink) and just simply wanted to have the coffee. She told me not to bring it, in a snarky tone, and that I should have brought it in another container. 

She got mad at me Friday for eating my ice cream on the way home instead of waiting to eat it with her when we got home. Didn’t think it was that big of a deal, I apologized. 

She’ll usually cut me off when we’re trying to order food, especially if I order food for her and I order it wrong, don’t say the right thing. Called me a “baby” in front of the server yesterday because I simply wanted more food than her and ordered another pizza.

Got mad at me once because I said the sauce we both made tasted like fish (in a funny tone, was not being serious, I actually liked it) and she got angry because all she could taste was fish because I said it. 

Doesn’t share the same sex drive as me, and sometimes I just feel guilty wanting sex. I’m a guy who (not to found arrogant) who has women literally coming up to me in public, restaurants, concerts, bars, the gym, to try to talk to me. I’ve been with women in the past who literally would beg me to come over for sex, and I never felt that desire from her side. 

Cuts me off during arguments, makes childish sighs when I’m explaining myself, and will say “okay” in a negative tone when she doesn’t like what I have to say. I work with middle school kids and deal with attitude all day. 

I feel like I love her, but when she argues, it’s an explosion and I feel like sometimes I can’t bring things up because she gets upset and I’m “attacking her” or “always picking things that are wrong with her” when really I’m just saying things that I’m not cool with. 

She says I don’t listen to her and she has to say things a million times before getting through to me. This one is fair, but I’ve been trying to be more understanding of her feelings. 

She thinks I’m too close with my own family, makes comments like “don’t worry, you get to see your mommy and sissy tomorrow” which feels blatantly disrespectful.

She’s the most attractive woman I’ve ever been with, and the thought of her being with another man makes me upset. But not sure if she’s the one for me.

Now, I personally don't do the ""dating other people"" think because I'm a one woman man, however is my mentality outdated and too old school? because I just really don't believe in dating other people whilst I'm seeing one person.  

I naturally tried setting up another date but our schedules didn't align... In that time however, they did send me pictures that they classed as ""promiscuous"" which i thought was confusing because I was of the understanding that she wanted to be friends, but it came across as though she wants more than that. She mentioned that she did that because she wanted attention from me, which makes sense because she was dealing with the heartbreak of her soon to be ex husband. Sometimes she would flirt back, that she admitted to which I guess is on both of us. 

Now, we spoke at length about how we haven't talked for nearly a week because she needed time away from her phone, but she had explained that she's trying to operate life away from social media which is fine. We agreed that we can be friends, but i have a few questions. 

Do I have a right to feel like I have been led on and should I continue being friends with the girl ? 

She's still open to doing coffee dates to be fair.",3,1757857550.0,dating,3,1.0,False

1ngrl3i,https://youtu.be/O6vCuMpRaRo,3 Very Scary TRUE Remote Gold Panning Horror Stories,"# ""The Baited Claim"":

I had always dreamed of striking it rich on my own, away from the crowds and the bosses. So when I heard about the old claims up in the Andes, near a forgotten valley in northern Peru, I packed my gear and headed out. It was just me, my pan, a shovel, and enough supplies to last a month. The road ended at a dusty trail, and from there, I hiked deeper into the hills, following a faded map I'd bought from a shop in Lima. The spot I picked was perfect— a narrow stream cutting through rocky ground, with signs of old diggings all around. I set up my tent by the water, staked my claim with a simple marker, and got to work right away.

The first few days went smooth. I sifted through the gravel, pulling out flecks of gold that sparkled in the sunlight. It wasn't a fortune, but it was enough to keep me going. One afternoon, as I was rinsing my pan, I spotted a figure coming down the opposite bank. He was a local man, maybe in his forties, carrying a backpack and a pickaxe. He waved and called out in Spanish, ""Hola, amigo! You find anything good here?""

I stood up, wiping my hands on my pants. ""A little,"" I replied in my basic Spanish. ""Just starting out. You work these parts too?""

He crossed the stream on some stepping stones and came over, grinning wide. His name was Luis, he said. He lived in a village a few hours walk away and prospected on the side when the farm work slowed. ""This valley has gold, but it's tricky,"" he told me, squatting down to look at my pan. ""You need to know the right spots. I can show you one, if you share what you find.""

We talked for a while. He seemed friendly enough, sharing stories about big hauls he'd heard of in the old days. I offered him some coffee from my pot, and he accepted, sitting on a rock while we drank. ""Be careful out here alone,"" he said, his eyes scanning the hills. ""Sometimes men come from the cities, looking to take what's not theirs. But you seem smart. Stick to your claim, and you'll be fine.""

I nodded, feeling a bit easier with company nearby. Before he left, he promised to check back in a couple days with that tip on a better vein. ""Don't work too late,"" he added with a laugh. ""The nights get long.""

That evening, I cooked beans over my small fire and turned in early. Sleep came quick, but around midnight, I woke to the sound of footsteps crunching on the gravel nearby. I sat up in my tent, listening hard. It was probably just an animal, I thought, but my hand reached for the flashlight anyway. The beam cut through the dark, showing nothing but empty rocks. I lay back down, telling myself it was nothing.

The next morning, I found footprints around my camp—boot prints, fresh and deep. They circled the tent but didn't go inside. Luis, maybe? I shook it off and got back to panning. By midday, I had a small vial half full of gold dust. That's when Luis returned, this time with another man trailing behind him. ""This is my cousin, Pedro,"" Luis said, introducing the newcomer. Pedro was younger, stocky, with a scar across his cheek. He didn't smile much, just nodded and stared at my setup.

""We brought you something,"" Luis said, pulling out a bottle of rum from his pack. ""To celebrate your luck."" We sat and shared it, the talk turning to the gold again. Pedro spoke up for the first time, his voice low. ""You know, this stream used to belong to my family. We worked it before the big companies came. But now, anyone can try.""

I felt a twinge of unease but kept it light. ""I'm not taking much. Just enough for me.""

Luis clapped me on the back. ""That's the spirit. Hey, Pedro found a spot upstream. Richer than this. Come see it tomorrow. We'll go together.""

I agreed, though something in Pedro's eyes made me hesitate. They left after an hour, and I watched them disappear up the trail. That night, the footsteps came again, closer this time. I grabbed my knife and peered out, but saw only shadows moving in the distance—two figures, whispering. My pulse raced as I ducked back inside, barricading the flap with my pack. They didn't approach, but I didn't sleep much after that.

Dawn broke, and I packed light for the trip upstream. Luis and Pedro were waiting when I reached the meeting spot. ""Ready for the big find?"" Luis asked, his grin as wide as ever.

We hiked for what felt like hours, the path narrowing into thick brush and jagged rocks. Pedro led the way, silent, while Luis chatted about old legends of miners who vanished with their gold. ""Some say they got lost,"" he said. ""Others say they met bad luck with worse men.""

Finally, we stopped at a clearing by a deeper pool in the stream. The water ran clearer here, and sure enough, as Pedro demonstrated with his pan, yellow flecks swirled up easy. ""See? Told you,"" Luis said. We worked side by side for a bit, pulling out more than I'd seen before. But as the sun climbed higher, Pedro stood and stretched. ""We should mark this as ours now,"" he muttered to Luis in quick Spanish.

I caught the words and looked up. ""What do you mean?""

Luis laughed it off. ""Just talking business, amigo. Partnerships make it safer out here.""

But Pedro wasn't laughing. He stepped closer, his hand resting on a machete at his belt. ""This claim is too good for one man. You share, or you go.""

My mouth went dry. ""I don't want trouble. I can leave some gold and head out.""

Pedro shook his head. ""No. All of it. And the spot stays with us.""

Luis tried to calm things, but his eyes darted nervously. ""Easy, Pedro. He's a friend.""

Then, from the trees behind us, two more men emerged—rough-looking, with rifles slung over their shoulders. They weren't there for panning. One of them, a tall guy with a bandana, spoke first. ""Luis said you had a nice setup. Time to join up or clear out.""

I backed away slowly, my mind racing. ""I don't want to join anything. I'll just go back to my camp and pack up.""

The tall one smirked. ""Too late for that. We don't like lone wolves sniffing around our hills.""

Pedro nodded to the others, and they fanned out, blocking the path back. Luis looked torn, muttering, ""I didn't mean for this. They made me bring you here.""

The realization hit me like a punch—they'd been watching my camp, the footprints were theirs, and Luis had been the bait. I turned to run, but the brush was thick, and Pedro lunged, grabbing my arm. I twisted free, elbowing him hard in the ribs. He grunted and swung the machete, the blade whistling past my shoulder.

""Get him!"" the tall one yelled, and they all closed in. I bolted into the undergrowth, branches whipping my face as I scrambled up a slope. Behind me, I heard them crashing through, cursing and shouting. ""You can't run far, gringo! We'll find you!""

My lungs burned as I climbed higher, slipping on loose rocks. I hid behind a boulder, pressing flat against the ground. Their voices echoed close—too close. ""Split up,"" Pedro ordered. ""He can't have gone far.""

One of them passed within feet of my spot, his boots crunching leaves. I held my breath, knife gripped tight in my hand. He paused, sniffing the air like he sensed something, then moved on. Minutes dragged like hours. When the sounds faded, I crept out and circled back down, heart hammering in my ears.

But they weren't done. As I neared the stream, shots rang out—crack, crack—from across the water. Bullets chipped the rocks near my feet. I dove into the shallows, the cold water soaking me through. Swimming low, I made it to the other bank and ran for my camp, grabbing my pack on the fly. No time to take the tent. Just the gold vial and essentials.

Night fell as I pushed on, the trail twisting through ravines. Every snap of a twig made me spin around, expecting them. Around a bend, I heard voices again—low, arguing. I ducked into a crevice and waited. It was the tall one and another. ""Luis messed up,"" the tall one said. ""Should have just taken him quiet.""

The other replied, ""We'll get the gringo tomorrow. No one escapes the valley.""

They passed, and I slipped away in the opposite direction, hiking through the dark until my legs gave out. I found a shallow cave and huddled inside, knife ready. The whole night, I replayed it—the friendly chat, the hidden rifles, Pedro's scar twisting in anger. What if they found me? What if Luis circled back with more lies?

By morning, I was moving again, aiming for the main road. But halfway there, I spotted smoke rising from ahead—my camp. They'd burned it, the flames licking the sky. No sign of them, but I knew they were close. I veered off the path, cutting through unmapped terrain, thorns tearing at my skin.

Hours later, exhausted and cut up, I stumbled onto the dirt road. A truck rumbled by, and I flagged it down, babbling about men with guns. The driver, an old farmer, believed me enough to speed to the nearest town. At the police station, I told my story, showing the gold vial as proof. They nodded, saying it happens too often—illegal crews fighting for every speck.

They sent a patrol back, but by then, the men were gone. The ashes of my camp were all that remained. I flew out the next day, vowing never to chase gold again. But even now, in the city, I check the locks twice and listen for footsteps at night. Those hills hold more than treasure—they hold men who'll kill for it, and they'll never stop hunting.





# ""River of Bones"":

I had always dreamed of striking it rich, so in the summer of 1932, I packed my gear and convinced my friend Jack to join me on a trip to the Nahanni Valley. We both figured the remote rivers up there held enough gold to change our lives. Jack was a sturdy guy, good with a rifle and always quick to laugh off worries. We loaded our canoe with pans, picks, food supplies, and a couple of tents, then set off from Fort Simpson. The journey took days, paddling against the current, but we talked the whole way about what we'd do with our fortune.

""Think we'll find nuggets big as fists?"" Jack asked one afternoon as we pulled the canoe ashore for a break.

I nodded. ""If the stories are right, yeah. But we have to watch out for claim jumpers. Folks say this place draws all kinds.""

He chuckled. ""Long as we stick together, we'll be fine.""

We reached a spot near Deadmen Valley, as some called it, and set up camp by a bend in the river. The water ran clear over gravel beds, perfect for panning. We spent the first few days sifting through sediment, finding flecks here and there—enough to keep our hopes up. Evenings, we'd sit by the fire, cooking beans and fish, sharing tales we'd heard back in town.

One night, Jack brought up the old rumors. ""You know about those McLeod brothers? Went missing years ago, then turned up without heads.""

I shrugged it off. ""Probably animals got to them after they died from hunger or cold. Don't let it spook you.""

But he leaned in closer. ""And that Swiss fellow, Jorgenson. Cabin burned, him decapitated right outside. Folks whisper it's someone guarding the gold, picking off prospectors one by one.""

""Superstition,"" I said, poking the fire. ""We're here for gold, not ghost stories.""

The next day, we hiked upstream to scout a new spot. That's when we found the first sign something was wrong. An old camp, abandoned, with rusted pans scattered around. In the dirt, half-buried, lay bones—human bones, picked clean. Jack knelt down and poked at them with a stick.

""Look at this,"" he muttered. ""Skull's missing. Just like the tales.""

My mouth went dry. ""Could be anything. Let's keep moving.""

We panned farther up, but the find stuck with us. That night, as we lay in our tents, I heard it—soft footsteps crunching leaves outside. I sat up, listening. The steps circled the camp, slow and deliberate.

""Jack,"" I whispered. ""You awake?""

""Yeah,"" he replied from his tent. ""Heard that too. Stay quiet.""

The footsteps stopped near my flap. I gripped my knife, barely breathing. After a long minute, they faded away. In the morning, we checked around. Boot prints in the mud, larger than ours.

""Someone's out here,"" Jack said, his voice low. ""Watching us.""

We decided to arm ourselves better, keeping rifles close. But the gold kept us going—we found a decent vein that day, pocketing small nuggets. Excitement pushed the fear aside for a bit.

""See? Worth it,"" Jack said, holding up a shiny piece. ""This could be our ticket out.""

Two nights later, the footsteps returned. This time, closer, and I heard breathing—heavy, like a man trying to stay silent. I bolted up and grabbed my rifle.

""Who's there?"" I called out.

No answer. Jack emerged from his tent, weapon ready. We scanned the darkness, but saw nothing.

""Must be a drifter,"" he whispered. ""Trying to scare us off our claim.""

We built the fire higher and took turns standing watch. Sleep came hard after that.

The following morning, Jack went to check our traps while I panned. He was gone longer than usual. Hours passed. I called his name, but only echoes came back. Worry built inside me like a knot tightening.

""Jack!"" I shouted again, hiking up the trail he'd taken.

That's when I smelled smoke. Ahead, a thin plume rose from the trees. I ran toward it, rifle in hand. What I found made my blood run cold—an old cabin, charred black, still smoldering. The door hung open. Inside, amid the ashes, lay a body. Jack's body. His head was gone, severed clean at the neck. Blood soaked the floorboards. His rifle lay beside him, unfired.

I stumbled back, retching. Panic flooded me. Who did this? Why? I spun around, expecting attack. The woods seemed to close in, every shadow hiding eyes.

Then I heard it—branches snapping nearby. Footsteps, heavy and fast, coming my way. I ran, crashing through underbrush, heart racing in my ears. Behind me, the pursuit grew louder. A voice growled, low and menacing.

""Get back here! That gold's mine!""

I glanced over my shoulder. A figure—tall, bearded, axe in hand—charged after me. His eyes burned with madness. I recognized the build from the boot prints.

I dodged trees, leaping over roots, heading for the river. My lungs burned, but I pushed on. The canoe was my only chance. The man gained ground, his boots pounding the earth.

""You saw too much!"" he yelled.

I reached the bank, shoved the canoe into the water, and jumped in. Paddling frantically downstream, I heard him splash in after me, but the current pulled me away. His curses faded as the river bent.

I didn't stop until miles later, beaching at a trading post. Told the Mounties everything. They searched, but found no trace of the killer. Just more bones in that valley. I never went back. The gold stayed there, but so did the horror. Every night, I hear those footsteps circling, waiting.





# ""Vanished in Palmerville"":

I had been mates with Bruce for years, ever since we bonded over metal detectors and the thrill of finding a nugget in the dirt. Kevin and Tremain were part of our little group too, all of us keen on getting away from the city noise to chase gold in the far north. We picked Palmerville Station because we heard the Palmer River still held some promise, even if it meant dealing with the vast emptiness of that cattle property. It stretched over a thousand square kilometers, with rough tracks cutting through scrub and dry gullies, far from any town. Cairns was hours away by road, and out there, phone signals were a joke unless you had a satellite setup.

We rolled in on the eighth of July, parking our vehicles in a hidden spot down a creek bed. No one wanted trouble with the owners, Stephen and Dianne. We'd run into them before on other trips—sharp words, glares that lingered too long. They ran the place like their personal kingdom, and prospectors like us weren't welcome. ""Let's keep low,"" I said to the lads as we unloaded our gear. ""Set up camp quick and stay out of sight.""

Bruce grinned, patting his dog Red on the head. ""Yeah, Dan. We'll be ghosts. Red here will sniff out the gold before anyone spots us."" Kevin nodded, slinging his detector over his shoulder. ""Just stick to the riverbed. No need to wander near the homestead."" Tremain chuckled. ""As long as we find something shiny, I'm good.""

That night around the fire, we talked plans. Bruce sketched a rough map on the ground with a stick. ""Tomorrow, we spread out along the Palmer. I'll take the upstream gully—looks promising from the old reports."" I agreed, but something nagged at me. The quiet out there was absolute, broken only by the occasional rustle in the bushes. We turned in early, detectors charged, picks ready.

Next morning, around seven-thirty, we headed out. The sun was up, but the gullies kept things shaded. We fanned out, each with our tools. I was about a hundred meters downstream from Bruce, sweeping my detector slow and steady. The beeps were faint, nothing exciting yet. Kevin was further off, Tremain on the other side.

Around ten, I heard an engine. Distant at first, then closer—a vehicle rumbling along the track above the gully. I crouched behind a boulder, peering up. It was their tan Toyota ute, the one we'd seen before. Stephen at the wheel, Dianne beside him. My pulse quickened. Why were they here now?

The ute stopped near where Bruce was working. I could see him from my spot, bent over his detector, headphones on, oblivious. Dianne pointed down into the gully, right at him. She said something to Stephen—I couldn't hear the words, but her tone was sharp, urgent. She got out, reached into the back seat, and pulled out what looked like a rifle. Long barrel, scoped. She pumped it once, up and down, like chambering a round.

I ducked lower, breath caught. ""No,"" I whispered to myself. ""Just drive on."" But they didn't. A crack echoed through the air—a gunshot, clear and loud. Birds scattered from the trees. I flattened against the ground, mind racing. Was that a warning shot? Or...

Minutes dragged. Ten, maybe fifteen. The engine idled, then revved. Another shot rang out, sharper this time. I waited, counting breaths, until the ute's noise faded away upstream.

I stayed put for what felt like forever, ears straining. No more sounds. Finally, I crept back toward camp, sticking to cover. Tremain beat me there, face pale. ""Dan, you hear that?"" he asked, voice low.

""Yeah. Two shots. Saw the ute—Stephen and Dianne.""

Kevin stumbled in soon after, out of breath. ""I heard it too. Sounded like something heavy got tossed in the back before the second one.""

We looked at each other. ""Where's Bruce?"" I said.

His dog Red was at camp, whining, tail low. But no Bruce. His vehicle was locked, satellite phone inside. We had no keys—Bruce carried them. ""He wouldn't leave Red,"" Kevin said. ""Something's wrong.""

We searched the gully where I'd seen him last. His detector lay abandoned, pick nearby. No sign of him. Footprints mixed with tire tracks. ""They took him,"" Tremain muttered. ""Those shots...""

I felt a wave of dread. The outback stretched endless around us, no help in sight. ""We can't stay here,"" I said. ""I'll ride back to Maytown, get my truck. You two wait.""

The ride was tense, every bump jolting me. What if they came back? What if they saw me? At my place, I grabbed the Nissan and sped back. By then, Kevin and Tremain had packed what they could. We left a note on Bruce's windscreen: ""Bruce, if you see this, we're heading to town. Call us.""

Back at my property, we tried calling the homestead. Tremain dialed first, left a message. ""Hey, this is Tremain. We were out by the river, heard shots. Bruce is missing. If he's with you, tell him to call. Otherwise, we're getting the cops.""

No answer. I tried again, same thing. Kevin phoned a mutual mate, Bruce Parker, who knew the owners. ""Tell them we heard gunfire,"" Kevin said. ""Ask if they've seen Bruce.""

Parker called, left his own message. Still nothing. By seven, we couldn't wait. Tremain and I drove to Laura Police, spilled everything. ""Our mate's gone,"" I told the officer. ""We saw the Strubers' ute, heard shots right where he was.""

The search started next day. Cops swarmed the station, questioned Stephen and Dianne. They claimed they hadn't seen anyone, hadn't fired a gun in days. But we knew better. The place was declared a crime scene—divers in the river, bikes on the tracks, volunteers combing the scrub.

Days turned to weeks. No Bruce. His body never turned up, but the evidence piled: our statements matched, forensics on the ute hinted at something. They arrested the pair, charged them with murder. Trial was brutal—us testifying, reliving it. Jury convicted them in 2015. Life sentences.

But knowing doesn't erase the fear. Out there in the gullies, I still hear those shots in my dreams. The way Dianne handled that rifle, cold and deliberate. We went for gold, but found something darker—people who saw us as intruders, worth erasing. Bruce's dog Red lives with me now, a reminder. I don't prospect anymore. The outback's too vast, too easy to vanish in.",1,1757857205.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

One of the standout features is the gel consistency that clings to surfaces, especially vertical ones. I’ve used typical sprays before, and they usually run down the surface and create a mess or don’t sit long enough to work properly. This gel, on the other hand, stays in place. For example, when I tried it on an old bumper sticker that had been on my car for years, the gel clung perfectly, softening and lifting the adhesive without needing aggressive tools.

**Surface-Safe Cleaning**

The surface-safe formulation is worth highlighting. I used it on wood, painted walls, and even my granite countertops, and it didn’t strip paint or leave any damage. I was hesitant at first, particularly when using it on my coffee table as it had a fancy finish, but the results were surprisingly good. However, I always recommend testing it on an inconspicuous area first, especially for sensitive surfaces like antiques. 

**Effective on Various Substances**

From removing stuck-on grease in the kitchen to crayon marks on the walls—thank you, kids—the effectiveness of this cleaner impressed me. Its powerful formula is versatile enough to handle shoe polish stains from the entryway and even some hardened glue on my desk left from a crafting session. My kids managed to get chewing gum stuck inside their play tent, and this product made short work of it. The citrus cleaning agent also adds a nice scent, much better than the harsh chemical smells of some competitors.

**Advantages**

- Clings to vertical and irregular surfaces  
- Does not damage finishes or strip paint  
- Works on a range of messes: adhesives, grease, crayon, and more  
- Pleasant citrus scent  

**Disadvantages**

- Requires several applications for excessively hardened residues  
- Bottle nozzle isn’t ideal for precision use, especially in tight spots  
- Slightly sticky feeling on hands if not thoroughly washed off  

**Citrus Scent and Ease of Use**

The citrus scent adds a fresh touch, which is a great bonus compared to the harsh, industrial odors that similar products often emit. It wasn’t overwhelming but clean and pleasant. Using it is a breeze; just spray the gel on the offending spot, let it sit for a minute or two, and then wipe it clean. For some tougher stains, like tar or deeply set adhesive, I had to reapply and give it more elbow grease, but the end results were worth it.

**Product Competitors**

Compared to other cleaners, like WD-40 or vinegar-based solutions, the Goo Gone Spray Gel has a clear edge in terms of surface safety and versatility. While WD-40 also works for adhesive removal, it tends to leave an oily residue that requires additional cleaning. Vinegar, though natural, lacks the power of the citrus-based formula here and isn’t as effective on tougher messes like crayon and gum. However, products like WD-40 might be more cost-efficient for strictly industrial cleanup tasks depending on your needs.

**Quality for Price**

Looking at the variety of issues it covers, the product offers good value for its versatility and efficiency. While it may not be the cheapest option available, the results justify its cost for residential and occasional commercial use. You save time and potentially protect the surfaces in your home from unnecessary damage, which seems like money well spent. If you’re buying it in the six-pack option, it’s even better as you can keep a bottle handy for different areas of the house or share with friends.

1ngriiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayedAndHeard/comments/1ngriiw/explore_the_best_acoustic_electric_guitar_fender/,Explore the Best Acoustic Electric Guitar Fender FA-25CE Worth It,"Fender’s reputation for crafting instruments that cater to every level of musician is well-established, and the Fender 0971913032 lives up to that legacy. As someone who spends hours strumming, fingerpicking, and occasionally butchering a good ol’ folk tune, I was pleasantly surprised by what this acoustic-electric guitar has to offer. It’s marketed as a beginner model, yet it boasts features that even seasoned players would appreciate. Unboxing it, I couldn't help but admire the sunburst finish that screams classic and yet understated elegance. This is the kind of guitar that makes you want to sit on the porch, coffee in hand, and crank out a few melodies while watching the world go by.

**DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY**  
The full-sized dreadnought body really packs a punch. With laminate basswood making up the back and sides combined with a spruce top, this guitar shines in terms of durability and tonal balance. I’ve owned guitars that felt like they were made of eggshells—this one, on the other hand, offers a sturdiness that screams, ""Take me with you on all your gigs, no matter how hectic."" The walnut fingerboard feels smooth under your fingers, and the satin finish on the neck adds to that “buttery” playing experience. Even the cutaway design caught my eye because it means easy access to upper frets—and let's be real, sometimes you need to hit that high note without looking like you’re auditioning for a Cirque du Soleil act.

**HIGHLIGHTS**  
- Comfortable satin-finish neck for long playing sessions  
- Built-in tuner makes on-the-go tuning super convenient  
- All-laminated body ensures durability without sacrificing sound  
- Classic aesthetic with a rich sunburst finish  
- C-shaped neck profile feels especially beginner-friendly  

[Want Fender 0971913032? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://voyss.com/p/b0cslvx698/)

**SOUND AND PERFORMANCE**  
Sound? Three words: mellow yet bold. The dreadnought body contributes to a powerful low-end resonance, making it ideal for country, folk, and even bluegrass. Despite being built for beginners, plugging into an amp via the onboard Fender FE-A2 electronics elevates its sound for live performances. Controls for volume and tone aren't rocket science, but they help dial in the sound depending on where and what you're playing. Personally, I tested it with a local coffee shop amp and got a rich warmth that filled the room. 

Some might find the bronze strings a tad ""bright"" right out of the box. However, after a couple of hours of playing (okay, maybe six or seven), they mellowed out beautifully. Changing to slightly heavier gauge strings could bring even more balance to its tonal landscape, but that’s totally a matter of preference.

**AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**  
- The bronze strings might feel too sharp for some, especially beginners  
- The laminate body, while robust, doesn’t match the resonance of solid wood  
- Small fret buzz on two strings, which required minor adjustment  

**EASE OF USE**  
Sliding your fingers over the fretboard feels like a dream on this. It's lightweight, so whether you're seated in your room or standing during gigs, it doesn't feel like a chore to carry around. Tuning is fuss-free with the built-in tuner, though I’ll admit it’s slightly less effective in a noisy environment. My nephew, who’s just started learning guitar, had no issues picking it up and strumming some basic chords. Considering he’s someone who couldn’t even hold a ukulele the right way last year, that speaks volumes about how approachable this guitar is.

**GOOD ASPECTS**  
- Lightweight design makes it highly portable  
- Beginner-friendly features such as the C-shaped neck and free lessons  
- Integrated volume and tone controls ensure sound customization  

**COMPETING PRODUCTS**  
When pitted against peers like Yamaha's FG800 or Ibanez's AW54CE, the Fender model holds its ground exceedingly well. Yamaha excels in sound clarity, particularly in the higher notes, while Ibanez might have the edge in punchy bass tones due to its solid mahogany top. However, neither comes with a subscription for lessons, and the Fender’s integrated tuner is far more beginner-conducive. To me, the Fender also wins in aesthetics—I mean, who doesn’t love a dramatic sunburst finish? If you're keen on a softer, folk-inspired tone, Yamaha could be your pick, but if you love versatility, this dreadnought is the ultimate underdog.

**FINANCIAL VALUE**  
Let’s talk cost-effectiveness. Sure, this isn’t positioned to compete with thousand-dollar Martins or Taylors, but it certainly delivers a lot of value for its price. One immediate perk is the inclusion of free lessons via Fender Play. I’ve seen beginners shell out for high-end guitars, only to spend weeks figuring out how to navigate tabs and strumming patterns. Here, you're not just buying an instrument; you’re investing in a learning platform that gets you playing Dust in the Wind sooner rather than later.

1ngrf0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGaming/comments/1ngrf0k/the_mobile_gaming_industry_is_vastly_rotten_to/,"The mobile Gaming Industry is vastly rotten to it's CORE and how ""We"" the players killed it (by a Game Dev)","These are my collected thoughts as a Game-Engine Dev on the rotten state of an industry that values the marketing team more than the game designers and aligns more with people’s impulses than providing a product of value, overcharged by the inability of the “modern” individual to make meaningful choices for himself and others. A true tale of psychological manipulation and hunting KPIs (statistical key performance indicator  we use in game-marketing, only good for a ""short-term analysis"") over creating a game for the sole purpose of being fun or a transformative experience and how the average player is “loving it” while in the process of dying. All in all, this is why mobile gaming will never recover from the dire state it is now and things will only get worst.

But let’s start our little story of insanity from the beginning.

You know, from my perspective as a developer today, it’s wild to look back at the history of mobile gaming. Even before I was in the industry, back when I was just a kid with a flip-phone, the games we had were these tiny J2ME apps. They were simplistic novelties, really. If you wanted a real, immersive gaming experience on the move, you needed a dedicated handheld. That was the rule.

The Game Boy Advance, and later the PSP and DS, were entirely different beasts. They were built from the ground up as gaming platforms with a proper HID—a Human Interface Device. Having physical buttons, D-pads, and analog sticks gives you a platform for precise control, which is critical for immersion. On those platforms, you could get deep, premium experiences. I remember spending countless hours on my PSP with titles like *God of War: Chains of Olympus*, Midnight Club 3 and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories; they were technical marvels that felt like home console games. Up to that point, ""portable gaming"" meant a dedicated console, and phones just weren't in the same league.

When the first iPhone and the App Store came out, everything changed. I had one of the first iPod Touches, and the intuitive nature of touching the screen was a completely new design paradigm. The early games were a blast, but the novelty wore off pretty quickly for me. The lack of precision was a real issue. A year or two later, I was back to carrying a PSP Go in my pocket for my commute because it just offered a better experience.

Still, that period gave us a glimpse of what could have been. We saw this brief, golden age of premium mobile games. Titles like *Infinity Blade* (2010), built on Unreal Engine 3, proved high-fidelity graphics were possible. EA's mobile *Dead Space* was a fantastic horror story, and *Dungeon Defenders* felt like a proper PC port of a proper full game. These were complete experiences you paid for.

But then came the rise of the games that by design had psychological triggers aimed at extracting  certain response from the player, and the financial reality of the market was brutal. The success of free-to-play games like *Clash of Clans* and *Candy Crush Saga* in 2012 completely rewrote the rules from the publisher’s side. You see … the industry works by appealing to the markets – a slave to quarterly profit – they fell for the revenue numbers and they were so massive that the industry's focus shifted almost overnight from making complete products to engineering retention loops. The mechanics were built around monetizing player frustration—selling time, selling second chances. It created a business model that was just too profitable to ignore.

This is the legacy we’ve inherited. The conversations in design meetings are almost always anchored by monetization and retention KPIs. Despite the incredible power of the devices in our pockets today, the business models in place actively discourage the creation of the kind of deep, premium experiences that once defined portable gaming.

And what's happening now is that a real, palpable fatigue has set in. As developers, we see it in the player data, and as gamers, we feel it ourselves. The constant notifications, the daily login rewards, the battle passes, the limited-time events—it's all designed to create a fear of missing out and transform a hobby into a commitment. The games demand your constant attention, but they rarely give you a satisfying conclusion. They aren't designed to end; they're designed to continue indefinitely, and that can be incredibly draining.

This is why so many people are turning to emulation on their phones. There's this beautiful irony in using a cutting-edge smartphone, a device born from the ecosystem that killed the premium handheld, to resurrect that very experience. Firing up an emulator and loading a PSP game feels like an act of rebellion. The difference is night and day.

When you play a game like *God of War: Chains of Olympus* through an emulator, you're getting a complete, self-contained product. It was designed from start to finish to provide a thrilling, paced, and ultimately finite experience. There are no ads to break your immersion. There are no timers stopping your progress. There are no pop-ups asking you to buy a bundle of gems. It's just you and the game, a pure and honest transaction. The controls might be mapped to a touchscreen or a connected controller like a Gamesir G8, but the core experience is one of respect for the player's time and intelligence. It feels better than almost any modern freemium game because it was built to be a great game, not a great monetization platform.

And baffled as I am, finding myself rather play almost 20-year-old games in my 1000$ flagship phone, I come face-to-face with the great paradox that used to perplex me before I joined the big tech industry as an engineer, went to the conventions and talked to the actual Devs. From a business standpoint, mobile gaming is bigger than ever. The revenue charts keep going up, so by that metric, it's ""on the rise"" but the “GOOD” games never come to the mobile platform, we always get an inferior watered-down version of the same game – adjusted for microtransactions and limited interactivity – it’s almost an insult to our intelligence. But having seen the industry from the inside out, I know that money talks and our work is secondary and for the mobile platform financial success is built on the back of the freemium model, a model that, from a design perspective, absolutely sucks the soul out of what we do; and while porting a game from a modern engine to ARM is not that hard, and also modern GPUs support VULKAN 1.3, companies prefer to NOT give you access to the IP and wait for a soul-sucking money-grabbing version of the franchise to be built instead – because this is the way the vast majority of mobile consumers prefers it – free AT ALL COSTS. And this model is here to stay, not because it produces the best games, but because it’s the most effective at extracting money. And because the consumer DEMANDS every mobile game to be a free experience – unwilling to pay – and so the “GOOD” games will NEVER come to the mobile market – no matter its size.

And honestly, I have thought this through a lot, you have to place a huge amount of the blame on the players themselves – not the entire community - but a certain demographic that fed the charts that the already rotten hyper-capitalistic system needed to see in order to tip-over. In essence, we got here because of a fundamental choice the market made over a decade ago. At large, the player base voted with their wallets—or rather, with their refusal to open them. They demonstrated, on a massive scale, that they would rather spend nothing and receive a vastly inferior, psychologically manipulative product than pay even a small, fair price for a good one. It's a consumer behavior that devalues the craft. We're talking about interactive art, experiences that a team of passionate people poured years into, and the market consensus was that it should be free. I come face-to-face time and time again with people being absolutely adamant that EVERY piece of software in their mobile device should be free or offer grate value under a subscription service and how they are willing to endure the ads if said subscription was to be offered for free instead. The true killer of mobile gaming is the societal problem of people not valuing their time enough and deciding to exchange based on instantaneous (and vastly exploitable, apparently) feelings rather than transact based on logic in order to receive an item of vastly greater value.

It’s this weird alignment where people are more comfortable being the product—being sold to advertisers or slowly milked for microtransactions—than being a customer who pays for a finished piece of art. They'll endure hours of ads or grind through tedious, time-gated mechanics to avoid a five-dollar price tag. The result is an ecosystem that rewards the most aggressive monetization, not the most creative or fulfilling gameplay. The human experience, the potential for a game to provide real value and leave a lasting impression, gets buried under layers of retention mechanics and purchase prompts.

That’s the part that, as a developer, is just maddening to watch, and it happens every single day. The market is absolutely a mirror of the consumer's refusal to pay for things that provide value back to themselves. This overwhelming preference for ""free"" created the monster, and it's a form of consumer greed—the desire to get hundreds of hours of entertainment, a product of immense technical and creative effort, without paying a cent upfront. This choice created a market where players aren't customers; they are a resource to be harvested, either through their data, their ad views, or their vulnerability to psychological spending triggers.

It’s an economic model built on what seems like utter insanity, when you step back and look at it. You see it play out in real life all the time. Picture a guy sitting at a café. He’ll drop five, maybe six bucks on an overpriced “latte macchiato double-cream whatever” without a second thought. He'll pull out a pack of cigarettes that cost him another five or six bucks and chain-smoke his way through half of it, ignoring everyone around him. He’s staring intently at his 500$ or even 1000$ smartphone, tapping away at a game he downloaded for free because the idea of paying even $2.99 for a ""premium"" game is somehow an outrageous rip-off in his mind.

He's actively consuming two products that offer fleeting, momentary satisfaction, costing him over ten dollars, while simultaneously engaging with a piece of complex interactive software he believes he is entitled to for free. He’ll endure an ad after every single round, he'll wait for his energy to refill, he'll put up with a user experience that is objectively terrible and designed to frustrate him. He does all of this to avoid a one-time fee that's less than what he just paid for his coffee and smokes combined. And he loves every moment of it, he wants MORE! This is masochism!

And here’s the truly insane part: an hour later, a pop-up appears in that ""free"" game offering a new legendary cosmetic skin for his character at a supposed “discount”. It does NOTHING and costs more than Witcher3 on a sale, offers no gameplay advantage and doesn’t change the gameplay loop. It's literally just a different set of models over the character’s skeleton. And that same person, who refused to pay a few dollars for a complete, well-crafted, ad-free experience, will pull out his credit card and drop twenty bucks on that skin without blinking. This is a terminal fault built into human nature, exploited to the Nth degree by big corporations and the rotten governmental structure does nothing through “education” to fix it at a young age.

It is absolute, certifiable madness. But it's the perfect illustration of the evil psychological genius of the freemium model. The model isn't designed to appeal to a person's sense of rational value. It's designed to bypass it entirely. It hooks them with a ""free"" investment of their time—the sunk cost—and then leverages social status, impulse, and carefully engineered desire to trigger a large, irrational purchase. He didn't buy a game; he bought a feeling. And we, as developers in this ecosystem, are no longer in the business of selling games. We're in the business of selling feelings, for twenty bucks a pop.

In fact, when you step back, the entire mobile gaming market is an anomaly. It's a feedback loop of greed, fed from both sides. From the publisher side, the greed is obvious. It’s the data-driven obsession with maximizing ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) and LTV (Lifetime Value). You see, big companies design games around analytics, not just fun. Every feature is A/B tested to see which one makes people play longer or spend more. It's the only segment of the industry where the most profitable products are the ones that are, by design, often the most annoying. We literally sell the cure to the friction we intentionally create. But the consumer side is just as complicit as stated above. The market is a mirror of their refusal to pay for things. The overwhelming preference for ""free"" created this monster. It's a form of consumer greed—the desire to get hundreds of hours of entertainment, a product of immense technical and creative effort, without paying a cent upfront.

And then you get to the really cynical stuff, the part we see in high-level corporate meetings. You can't separate a game like *Call of Duty: Mobile* or *Diablo Immortal* from the publicly traded behemoths that own them. These companies are not just game studios; they are massive corporations with shareholders, investment funds, and a constant need to manage their public image. When you see big-budget mobile games suddenly incorporating overt political or social messaging, it’s hard not to see the corporate playbook.

From the inside, it often feels less like genuine artistic expression and more like a calculated, brand-safe form of corporate PR. It's a way to whitewash the name of the company for the big capitalist investors who are increasingly concerned with ESG scores and public perception. It’s a way to signal virtue to a certain market segment and generate positive headlines that can offset the negative press that inevitably comes from having a business model based on what are essentially slot machine mechanics. It’s a layer of paint to make the machine look friendly, to make you forget that the core engine is designed to profit from what are often the most exploitative aspects of human psychology.

Because of this triple lethal combination between \[insane consumer behavior\] – \[capital greed\] – \[corporate whitewashing through politics in media\] , I genuinely believe mainstream mobile gaming, as we know it, is lost for good. The F2P model is a gravity well; the financial incentives are so powerful that it's nearly impossible for major studios to escape it. We’re not going to see a widespread return to premium, story-driven mobile exclusives. The market has been conditioned for a decade to expect ""free,"" and the most profitable path will always be to give them that, along with all the baggage that comes with it.

But that’s why emulation is becoming so much more than just a retro hobby. It's the light at the end of the tunnel for the mobile gaming dark age we're in. It's the ultimate escape hatch. For years, we've had fantastic emulation for classic consoles, but the real game-changer now is the progress being made in Windows emulation on Android. Thanks to projects like Winlator, the idea of running PC games on our phones is no longer a pipe dream.

Think about what that means. It’s not just about playing old console games anymore. We're talking about having access to decades of PC gaming history—some of the deepest, most complex, and most beloved premium games ever made—running natively on the device in your pocket. The entire Steam and GOG back catalog becomes your potential library. You can play the Batman series games on steam, The Witcher games from gog or an indie masterpiece like *Hollow Knight: Silksong* without ads, without timers, and without a single microtransaction. It's the final frontier for portable gaming, completely bypassing the broken mobile market. It proves that the hardware was never the problem; it was always the business model, the way marketing analysis dictates a studio’s output and rotten behavior by the consumer. Emulation is how we finally get the premium, uncompromised gaming experience that our powerful mobile devices have deserved all along.

As a final light to the tunnel, comes the rise of mobile gamepads like the Backbone and Kishi, and this new wave of Android devices designed with built-in controllers and docking station support—that’s not a sign of mobile gaming's health. It’s a symptom of its failure. You see players trying to physically bolt a better experience onto their phones because the software ecosystem itself is so hostile to what makes a game good. They are trying to reintroduce a proper HID because the native interface, while brilliant for some things, has been largely ignored in favor of simple, monetization-friendly taps and swipes.

I had initially grabbed it, thinking it’d just be a backup or something for minor countertop tasks, but it turned out to be far more clever than I anticipated. For a small-sized toaster oven, it punches well above its weight class in terms of versatility and functionality. At first glance, it’s sleek, compact, and undeniably modern with its brushed stainless steel finish. But much like relationships, it’s not just about looking good; there was a lot going on under the hood that impressed me.

**Compact Yet Mighty Design**

Its dimensions, about 13.6 inches deep, 16 inches wide, and 8.8 inches tall, suit small kitchens or limited counter spaces effortlessly. As someone who lives in an apartment with a borderline microscopic kitchen, this compact design was a lifesaver. I could tuck it into a corner without sacrificing functionality or accessibility. Surprisingly, the interior fits four slices of toast or an 11-inch pizza – more than enough for everyday usage. On the flip side, if you’re trying to roast a turkey for Thanksgiving, let’s just say this little guy isn’t up for that challenge. For smaller households or single-person cooking, it’s golden.

**Features That Actually Impress**

This countertop oven’s standout feature is its Element iQ technology, which uses five independent quartz elements. I felt like a futuristic chef maneuvering a machine that smartly adjusts power to different heating elements as needed. Essentially, it delivers heat precisely where it's required, so your food ends up evenly cooked. Toasting bread? It’s golden-brown perfection. Baking cookies? Somehow, they’re not burned on the edges but delightfully chewy throughout. Watching this play out is oddly satisfying.

By offering eight cooking modes – toast, bagel, bake, broil, pizza, roast, cookies, and reheat – it replaces multiple standalone appliances, saving money and counter space. Though, the bagel setting kind of confuses me. It toasts just the tops, which I didn’t even realize was something “needed” in life until I had it. My mornings have genuinely leveled up.

**Straightforward Operation with LCD Display**

The LCD display is one of my favorite things about using this mini smart oven. It makes selecting and adjusting the settings so damn simple, even after my first coffee hasn’t kicked in. The screen is delightfully intuitive, showing you precisely what mode you’ve chosen, the temperature, and how much time remains. None of that random button-holding to guess what setting you’re on. Plus, it just feels high-tech enough for the button-loving nerd in me without being overwhelming.

**Easy Maintenance with Non-Stick Coating**

Cleaning up after cooking isn’t fun, but this oven makes it tolerable. The non-stick cavity coating on the interior ensures food residue doesn’t latch on like it’s auditioning for Velcro. That pull-out crumb tray is a solid convenience feature too; I use this alongside every toast session, and it keeps things pretty manageable. It seems they took the “easy to clean” part seriously, and for that, I applaud them.

**Upsides**

- Element iQ ensures even and precise cooking for various meal types.
- Compact enough for small kitchens yet big enough to handle decent portions.
- Multifunctional, with eight preset cooking settings for versatility.
- Super simple LCD interface makes it user-friendly.
- Easy maintenance thanks to its non-stick interior and pull-out crumb tray.

**Adverse Aspects**

- Bulk baking or cooking won’t be its forte. A standard oven is still needed for big meals.
- Fan noise is noticeable, though not annoying, while it operates.
- The exterior gets warm during cooking, which might mean you need to scoot it back a bit from walls or heat-sensitive objects.

**Peer Products**

Comparing this to other toaster ovens like the Cuisinart TOB-135N or the Black+Decker CTO6335S, I noticed the Breville is a touch pricier. However, you get more precise cooking thanks to the Element iQ. The Cuisinart does offer a slightly larger capacity, which might appeal to households needing to crank out larger meals. On the other hand, the Black+Decker oven tends to fall behind in both build quality and cooking consistency. None of them have really nailed the design aesthetic as well as Breville has either. Plus, some of the cheaper models don’t come close to the preheating speed that the Breville offers.  

**Money’s Worth**

In hindsight, questioning if this is worth the investment was pointless. For someone who practically lives off bagels, toast, mini pizzas, or occasional casseroles, it’s absolute gold. It’s not a gadget designed to replace your big oven entirely, but for day-to-day convenience, its speed and versatility justify every penny. Rather than resorting to multiple appliances cluttering up the countertop, this tiny powerhouse fills the gap perfectly. Plus, the savings in energy use compared to warming up a traditional oven for small meals is an added bonus!

I’ve been back into the dating world and I have been going way above calorie limit. I try to order salads but then they insist on getting drinks, dessert, or just a calorie dense meal in general. They know I calorie count I don’t hide it. But then they get all. Oh you should break your diet with me and I agree it’s good to break it about once a week. However I literally have 5 dates a week all with different guys just trying to feel out whom is right for me. 

Any ideas for dates (especially 1st/ 2nd dates that don’t involve large amounts of food, I need decent alternatives? Coffee doesn’t work they always want a better date than a coffee date. 

I try to stay within a 1200 calorie budget and my app tracks exercise, the more I exercise the more I can eat but I don’t have free time to spend hours exercising at least the next 2 weeks. 

Edit: Saw some replies guess I need to explain more. I’m not telling these guys how many other dates I’m having, especially when it’s 2+ a day. I’m not eating 1,000 calories or more on each date. I’m trying to stick to salads for dinner and having mixed greens instead of bacon and potatoes with breakfast but because they are from restaurants forget it a salad becomes 800 calories. It’s not the individual meals per se, (every now and then it can be) it’s more the frequency of people asking me out and everyone having the same time off on the weekends.

I haven’t been able to get tested for anything so I just want to list my symptoms and see what it could be. I’m 30 now but when I was in high school for about a half of the year I’d wake up and throw up, the second I woke up I was nauseous and I would eat breakfast and throw up. Then I’d feel better throughout the day. But sometimes at night I’d wake up and feel like I couldn’t breathe. I thought it was anxiety. I didn’t want to be medicated so I started drinking chamomile tea in the mornings and at night. The throwing up went away, the “anxiety” did too. Fast forward to now I started getting really bad acid reflux, my chest would burn everyday no matter what I ate or drink, tums made things worse. I quit coffee and sodas. I eat pretty clean by the way. So acid reflux is gone now. I am a little bit constipated. I maybe poop every other day, sometimes I go 2/3 days without pooping. I don’t really get bloated though. Anyway, reflux is gone but now I developed a white tongue and my breath fucking stinks, like straight up shit. I brush, floss, tounge scrape. I go to the dentist every 6 months or so for deep cleanings. Dentist says I have some periodontitis. But would that really make my breath smell like poop? I don’t know I think it’s coming from my stomach, sometimes I smell it in my nose even without opening my mouth, and it’s worse when my stomach is empty. Oh and I feel like something is always stuck in my throat that I can’t swallow, like mucus or I don’t know what. I also started getting dandruff in my scalp which I never had before. And I sweat more than usual. I can shower and then start sweating and start smelling like my armpits and stuff and I never had that problem before. I know it’s alot of symptoms but from my research seems like it could be a fungal overgrowth? In my gut, on my tongue and scalp. I don’t know what to do anymore. ",1,1757856517.0,Candida,0,1.0,False

(Had absolutely no clue these existed)","I ordered the Amul Protein Blueberry Shake (pack of 8) about 3 days ago for Rs. 400. Received it today. So, delivery was quite quick l'd say.
 
I wanted to get the Lassi, but that's been out of stock for quite a while. 20g per bottle for Rs. 50 seemed like a good deal so went ahead with this.
 
**Taste** - liked it. It's a bit like Epigamia Blueberry Yogurt but almost 60% less sweet. If you're someone who likes sugary liquids, you'l feel this is very bland(ish). But I've recently started avoiding sugar in my coffee/tea so I've gotten used to it. So, I kinda liked the mild taste. Quite thick, so took 2-3 sips then added some chilled water and diluted it. Seemed fine even then.
 
**Nutrients (Pic attached)** - Saw quite a few posts on this sub comparing this with whey where some are for and some against these Amul products. Did my own reading and also asked gpt. Bottomline was that just like whey, this shake also has good quality protein with those essential amino acids since it has casein & whey. Just that the carb content is higher here compared to whey (20g vs 2g). The absorption for whey is said to be better. But apart from that, 20g protein in ~140cals for just Rs. 50 is a bargain.
 
Will take these for atleast 3 weeks and see how tummy reacts to it (l'm a bit lactose intolerant). But if it suits, then probably prefer this over whey.

Some of you know a bit about me, but for those that don’t this will be a quick summary of some  random things about me.

I will try to be brief, but I have bit of a tendency to be loquacious at times. 

I am a later in life transitioned trans woman.  I told my parents around 4 that I was a girl.  All efforts to change that certainty were ineffective.  I spent almost all of my life living as a man. I hated almost everything about it. While there were reasons I chose to do this, it is the worst thing I ever did.  I think it’s a waste of energy to spend too much time on regret, but I am still not quite done letting go of my regret for all that lost time.

I am an immeasurably happier, more well rounded person post transition.  My crippling anxiety is basically gone.  I am comfortable and confident in a way I absolutely did not think was possible for me.  Despite any unpleasantness I have gone through,  I consider myself to be incredibly lucky.  I have a lot of great things in my life that I did nothing to deserve.

I tend to think of myself as a transexual.  That was the term I encountered when I first learned I was not the only person like me.  While I think transsexual is the most accurate,  I don’t really care if people use transgender.  I often use it myself because
transexual has some connotations for some that I’m not always in the mood to deal with.

I honestly don’t think much about being trans now when I’m not talking about it on Reddit.  

My views as they relate to sex/gender are not the same as they have always been. Despite the fact that I can talk a lot, I do listen to people who I disagree with.  Several people on this sub have been directly responsible for some of my changes in perspective. Obviously, it is totally fine to point out if I happen to say something that contradicts something I have said before, but I’m likely to just tell you I’ve changed my mind and why.  I view changing your belief of what is true when presented with new information is a strength not a weakness.

Random views:

Bathrooms - WTF are we still talking about bathrooms

Sports - I do not care about sports.  Let sports bodies govern sports and keep the government and lobby groups out of it.  

Gender identity - I believe it’s real, but it’s not particularly useful for any kind of argument.

Self ID - I believe in self ID but only in so far as how I address a person.  It has no bearing on any other common gender related issue.

Gatekeeping - I don’t really like the old model, but I do think that gatekeeping the considerations most trans people want from society is necessary.  

Beverages - coffee is infinitely better than herbal tea.  I’m in the first day of my caffeine detox/reset, and I’m feeling a bit pissy about it.

I’m happy to answer questions, but this post is long enough.

1ngr7v4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IronmanTriathlon/comments/1ngr7v4/zero_to_ironman_in_1_year_post_race_report/,Zero to Ironman in 1 year: Post Race Report,"I know there's a ton of posts that are always asking if they have enough time to train for an Ironman with little experience, so I thought it would be useful to recap my own journey going from essentially no training or experience to doing an Ironman in a year.

# My background

I came into this as a pretty fit 28 year old man, but mostly doing lifting/rock climbing, with very little endurance training. I took swim lessons as a kid and did a single year of high school swimming, but that was more than 10 years ago. I had never biked more than 20 miles, and never ran more than 6. However, my mom has done 16 Ironmans, and my brother has done 3, and I definitely leaned on them both for advice. It was watching my mom do Ironman Wisconsin last year that convinced me to aim for doing the same this year, since I figured 1 year was just about the minimum I'd need. 

# Training

I told myself I would start the first few months just seeing if I enjoyed the training enough to commit to the expense and time needed. I have access to a really nice pool at my gym, and live in California so was able to run year round outside. I put off getting a bike for 3 months because it was such a big expense, but started biking on indoor stationary bikes at the gym. Also, I used no training plan. I downloaded a free one and referenced it very sparingly, just to make sure the distances I was doing were in the same ballpark. 

I was definitely surprised by how much I enjoyed the swimming and running, since I hated my one year of swimming in high school. After a few months, I decided I wanted to register for the race and get a bike. I did not trust my ability to evaluate a used bike, so I found a Scott road bike on clearance at my local bike store for $1200 and got started. 

My training was roughly 2 sessions per discipline a week. I usually swam around 1200-2000 yards Tues/Thurs, did a medium length run during the week, and a long run on the weekend. I would typically bike on the stationary bike during the week and then a long ride outside on the weekend. 

My biggest distances prior to the race were 3000 yard swim, a 20 mile run, and I did a few long rides ranging from 70-100 miles. I also did a complete half ironman on my own about 3 weeks before the race, as the main big workout before starting my taper. 

In terms of my paces, I worked a lot on my swim technique and started around 2:15-2:30/100 yards, and got it down to about 1:50. I watched some youtube videos but I definitely had a stronger base in swimming than a lot of triathletes. Biking was what I was most concerned about, especially with the Madison course, but with the recent addition of my aero bars, I felt comfortable I could make the cutoffs. Most of my runs were between 9-10 minute miles. I did almost no speed work or tempo runs. 

I also **heavily** trained my nutrition based on advice from my mom and brother. I ate during almost every training session. I experimented with fruit bars, marshmallows, liquidIV, Gatorade, poptarts, bananas, fruit snacks and more. I felt pretty comfortable going in that I had a plan that worked for me. 

**Taper:** Life got kind of busy, and I shipped my bike back early to make sure there were no issues. I also got COVID 4 weeks out from the race, which also messed up my timing a bit. I probably came in a little over tapered.

# Race

**Breakfast:** Immediate coffee to get things moving, followed by two jellied bagels. 

**Swim:** I knew the swim would be my best discipline, but I was mostly afraid I'd get nervous at the start of the race, and also uneasy about having so many people in the water. I only did a few open water swims, but that included the course a few days prior, which made me feel confident that the water wasn't going to be too cold or choppy for me. I tried to self seed in 1:20-1:30 but it was too crowded, so I started around 1:30-1:40. I also intentionally swam on the outer edge of the course, since I preferred to swim a slightly longer distance if it meant less people to navigate. Overall I was super happy with my swim and my plan: I finished in just about 80 minutes.

**T1**: I planned on taking my time in transition, since I was just going for the finish. I also wore contacts in the swim, but wanted to put my glasses on for the bike, so had to clean my hands with some wipes and pop em out. I ate another jellied bagel, applied sunscreen and lube, and changed into my bike gear.

**Bike**: This is what I was most nervous about. I was very very glad that it ended up being a chilly day in Madison, and not super hot during the middle of the day. I started well, but kept reminding myself to keep a calm pace. I was aiming for roughly 100g carbs per hour. I drank 100g of Skratch high carbs mix every two hours, 1 bottle of gatorade (I brought baggies of powder) and a maurten gel every hour, alternating caffeinated and non. I felt solid through the first half, but the second loop was a major drag. I was on track to finish in the cutoff, but getting stiff and my butt starting to hurt. I finished in around 8 hours. 

**T2**: Again I took my time, put my contacts back in, changed and ate. I had heard over and over to not eat anything new on race day, but they had chicken broth and it tasted so good. I probably only had 3-4 ounces, and half of a bagel, but this ended up putting a big damper on the start of my run.

**Run**: Either the chicken broth or the bagel did not sit well with me, and for the first 6-7 miles of the run I had to do a lot of walking. I even laid down for 2 minutes to try to settle my stomach. But I kept pushing and my stomach eventually started feeling a bit better. My gatorade started tasting horrible, and I was probably getting low on electrolytes. But then I got some Mortal and starting eating bananas, which did the trick to get me over the line. I got a little too excited and did 3 miles in the middle at about 9-10 pace, the rest were much slower and lots of walking. Ultimately finished around 11:15 with a marathon time around 6 hours and a total time of 16 hours. 

# Overall Thoughts

I think that anyone who is generally fit can do this if they have the time (and money). A huge part of the race was mental, but the rest was just trusting your training. I'm not sure I'll do another one: I think the length of the bike is just not for me. There's only so good you can feel by mile 80. I think even if I was a better biker, it wouldn't be my thing. I'd consider doing another one because I'm curious how it would've gone without my stomach issues, but I might just do a standalone marathon. 

Key things I'd do differently:

1. Get all my bike accessories earlier: clipin shoes and aero bars. Both made a huge difference and I wish I had them more for the training.

2. Definitely avoid the food in T2

3. I should've probably upped the volume in general on my bike. I did enough to know I would finish but should've done more.

#Sufism Endures in Lebanon’s Marginalized North
While the mystical traditions have retreated elsewhere in the country in the face of threats, rural Akkar’s villages keep them alive through music, ritual and joy

Madeline Edwards is a journalist and sewist who writes about rural life, offbeat histories and the environment

September 11, 2025

The drumbeats started softly in the distance, somewhere around the corner in a stone alleyway. Suddenly, down the small road that snakes through the cemetery in Berkayel, northern Lebanon, a few dozen villagers emerged: little girls in bright dresses handing out sweets, women filming on their phones, men swaying and chanting to the tambourines. At the front of them all was one Muhammad Khaled Mousa, decked out in the robes and bright-green headgear of a Sufi religious sheikh. He was leading them to the green-domed tomb of one of his predecessors at the helm of Berkayel’s Sufi order.
Last Thursday was Eid al-Mawlid al-Nabawi, an Islamic festival that marks the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday. It’s also one of the biggest ceremony days for adherents of Sufism, a mystical form of Islam born in the medieval era that celebrates asceticism and love, and eschews the rigid by-the-book line of more conservative Salafists.

Mawlid is the biggest gathering for Sufis here in Akkar, but weekly worship sessions throughout the rest of the year also include intricate “zikr” prayer ceremonies with religious “nasheed” songs, as worshippers sway and twirl their bodies to the steady rhythm of drums. In Berkayel, at the front of the procession, men wrapped in bright-green cloth spun round to the music and crashed bronze cymbals together in an almost glittering beat. It quickened, rising, then suddenly stopped.


Elsewhere in Lebanon, Sufism is fading somewhat. In Tripoli, once a vibrant center for the tradition, adherents are gathering more privately, away from public eyes, according to Mira Minkara. She works as a tour guide in Tripoli, her home city, where she describes herself as “on a Sufi path.” Her own sheikh still runs communal zikr ceremonies for both men and women, though other Sufi orders in the city have faced harassment from hard-line Salafists.

Historically, the two are split on ideological lines, with Salafists preaching literalist interpretations of the Quran versus Sufis’ purification of the soul through divine law. The split coincides with political rifts too; in Tripoli, the growth of an armed Salafist movement in recent decades — thanks partly to spillover from the war in Syria, but also to socioeconomic woes — means Sufis in the city feel less safe openly practicing their rites.
In northern Lebanon’s Akkar governorate, however, where a predominantly Sunni Muslim population is spread across rolling mountains, village-level Sufi orders with their own “zawiyas” (designated spaces for the practice of Sufi rituals as well as religious study and learning) and winding lineages of revered sheikhs are thriving — openly.
There’s a veritable rabbit hole on YouTube of grainy cellphone footage of the ceremonies — from official zikr gatherings in beautifully lit Akkar mosques attended by big-shot Sunni religious figures, to groups of local guys simply gathered in the poured-cement frames of unfinished buildings, the biggest empty spaces available to them.
The largest zawiya is in the village of Maccha, where, I was told, the grandest Mawlid ceremony in the governorate takes place. It’s also the oldest existing zawiya that’s still in use, according to Bilal Abdelfattah. A music teacher and oud player by day, Bilal spent the past several years traveling between Akkar’s rural villages, recording the nasheed music of their local Sufi orders for a master’s thesis in musicology. He, too, is from Akkar, from a small town called Haizouq that, like dozens of others, has a small zawiya hidden in its streets. It sits empty these days, as the village’s faithful stream instead to the bigger zawiya in Machha, but the memories of its zikr ceremonies remain.


“I grew up with this music,” Bilal told me after Thursday night’s Mawlid ceremonies. According to him, Sufism has been active in Akkar since at least the ninth century, when the Sufi traveler Ahmad ibn Abi al-Hawari found evidence of worship during his wanderings around the Levant. When I asked local Sufi sheikhs how long it’s been, they simply said “hundreds” of years, a long line of their fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers stretching back to somewhere in the distant past. Students from today’s Lebanon likely studied under Sufi mystics in nearby Syrian cities like Homs or, further afield, Aleppo, later bringing the movement back home to their villages in the Akkar mountains.


That was after Sufism had already spread through much of the medieval Islamic world, partly in reaction to social injustices in medieval Baghdad under the Abbasids. “There was a lot of poverty,” Bilal said. “People turned to spiritualism.”
Akkar, too, is suffering. Hours north of Beirut, it’s long been neglected by the state. A countrywide financial crisis since 2019 has seen the poverty rate across Lebanon triple, reaching as high as 70% in Akkar, according to a World Bank survey. Most people work in agriculture or construction, or join the Lebanese army, giving the governorate its nickname: “the storehouse of the army.”


“It’s a neglected area, and poor,” according to Bilal. “No universities, few job opportunities. This makes people in Akkar turn inward into themselves, to [religion] as a form of therapy. … Sufism is a shelter from all these things.”

At the Mawlid ceremony in Machha, hundreds of men gathered in the village’s stone zawiya building, spilling out into the courtyard’s solemn circle of plastic chairs. At the helm was one Sheikh Muhammad Abu Obeida al-Zoubi, wrapped in green and sporting a long gray beard. One by one, other Akkar sheikhs and religious students wearing green “taqiyah” caps filed in, to pay their respects before a band of nasheed players began their steady chants.

I watched from above, on a balcony with the women — including Sheikh Muhammad’s wife, Fatina. She breathlessly handed out coffee and sweets. Just steps away were her kitchen, living room and bedroom; the couple live in the zawiya full time, taking care of its little collection of historic prayer books and drums.

One book, I was told, was a 500-year-old volume of the Prophet Muhammad’s sayings, passed down through the ages. Fatina’s son Obeida — slated to become the next head sheikh of Maccha’s Sufis after his father — lovingly flipped through its pages, showing me where they had been torn and weathered by time. His son, a little boy with glasses, waited in the next room.

“People think we are all extremists [here in Akkar], but it’s the opposite,” Fatina later said, taking a break on a sofa in the women’s wing of the living quarters. Like on Mawlid: “For us, it means joy, as you can see.”

Finally, her husband, Sheikh Muhammad, found a few moments to rest too. He looked wizened and serious and, I realized, exactly like Christopher Lee’s Saruman the White. Since he was a little boy, he knew that someday he would become the head of Machha’s old zawiya. Like the nasheeds themselves, the books, the hand-sewn banners in the prayer room bearing the names of the prophets, so, too, does leadership of the town’s Sufis get passed down, he said, “from generation to generation.”

Why are there so many Sufis in Akkar? “The people here are loving,” the sheikh told me, simply. “Our religion is one of love.”

He soon walked back out across the street, into the river of men now entering the adjoining mosque. From the huge speakers placed outside, I heard the sound of an elderly voice preaching and, before I noticed the transition, the growing voices of the Sufi congregants chanting to a quickening drumbeat.
I heard shouts of “Oh, Allah!” as the words of praise blended together in the night.

#Inside Beirut’s Fight To Save Its Reading Culture
As reading declines and self-censorship grows, bookshops are shuttering in the city once hailed as the Arab world’s publishing capital

Eight years ago, a visit to Aaliya’s Books in Beirut would have offered clear evidence of a flourishing literary scene in Lebanon. By day, readers sank into cracked leather armchairs and perused the shop’s extensive collection of English-language books. At night, book launches, readings and discussion groups regularly filled the venue. Guests would crowd the narrow bar, angling for a spot close to the bartenders while waitstaff darted through the crush of people

Aaliya’s “Cliffhanger” storytelling nights became a fixture of the city’s cultural calendar, reviving traditional “hakawati” tales before an eager audience. On those evenings, visitors would spill out into the adjacent alleyway, straining to catch the end of a story. The bookshop had only opened in 2016, but within eight months, footfall had increased by 400% compared to the previous cafe located at the venue.

Today, Aaliya’s is shuttered up.
The closure speaks to a wider trend in the city. Over the past few years, several of Beirut’s literary spaces have been forced to shut down amid increased financial pressure and the continued crises facing the country. The iconic Librairie Antoine branch in Beirut Souks closed after suffering extensive damage during the 2020 port blast. Hook, a community-focused reading cafe, temporarily ceased operations in July 2025 due to mounting financial pressures. Papercup, once a cornerstone of Mar Mikhael’s creative scene, was replaced by a natural wine bar in 2023.



The list goes on. Ayad Khabbazeh, owner of Kitabi 2021 Bookshop, tells me that closures have hit the Hamra district particularly hard. “Ras Beirut Bookshop, Ashrafieh, Four Steps Down, Khaya, Almadina, Librairie du Liban, Said Bookshop,” he trails off. “They are all closed now.”
The current condition of the sector stands in stark contrast to the era that first earned it its name. “Cairo writes, Beirut publishes and Baghdad reads” is a phrase that repeatedly crops up in the conversations I have. 


It refers to the period before Lebanon’s civil war, when its liberalism made it a cultural beacon of the Arab world. Local presses translated Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Althusser into Arabic. Political tracts, literary magazines and radical novels started to emerge from dissident writers expelled from their own countries.



Over time, heightened censorship began to impact the sector. During the civil war, Christian militias banned Arab nationalist and Marxist works, while Islamist factions censored a myriad of secular, Israeli and leftist writings. Syria’s withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005 brought with it a new openness, though the General Security Directorate retained the right to ban books.



The literary sector no longer benefits from some of the liberties it once enjoyed, with censored works still difficult to source today. “Salman Rushdie’s ‘Satanic Verses’ is a prime example,” Niamh Fleming-Farrell, the co-founder of Aaliya’s Books, tells me. The book, published in 1988, was banned a year later amid waves of controversy from Lebanon’s Muslim community, who saw the fictionalized version of the Prophet Muhammad as an example of blasphemy. “Suppliers simply tell you that you cannot order or sell it.”


Another notable case of censorship is “Princess Nina” (2013) by Marlise Achterbergh. The children’s book describes a princess being pressured into finding a prince to marry. After searching far and wide, she falls in love with another princess. The LGBTQ+ content upset a large number of parents and conservative factions in the country, resulting in an official ban by General Security.


Despite these attempts at censorship, a large number of pro-LGBTQ+ and sexually explicit books have slipped through the cracks. “Bareed Mista3jil,” a 2009 anthology of real stories from queer women in Lebanon, Maya Zankoul’s illustrated diary “Amalgam Vol. 2” (2022), featuring sexual content and critiques of institutions, and Saleem Haddad’s 2016 “Guapa,” a gay coming-of-age novel, are examples of works still available in major bookstores across the country.


“Even if books are officially banned, there are ways to get them,” Ayman Mhanna, executive director at the Samir Kassir Foundation’s SKeyes Center for Media and Cultural Freedom, tells me. “You can buy them when abroad, access it on a Kindle or download a PDF online.” For those who prefer a paperback, there are even printers in Beirut offering to turn PDF versions of banned books into physical copies.


Librarians at Kitabi, Halabi Bookshop and Barzakh tell me that banned books often circulate at their secondhand bookshops. “‘The Da Vinci Code’ by Dan Brown, and its translated Arabic edition released by a Lebanese publisher, were banned in Lebanon in 2004 for its offensiveness towards Christianity,” says Lana Halabi, the owner of Halabi Bookshop. “We still receive secondhand copies of it to sell.”



There is little concern that resellers of banned books will face prosecution. “In the last 10 years of my career, I have only ever known one bookshop to have a check from the General Security,” Halabi recalls.


Perhaps what is more prevalent in limiting the scope of the literary scene is the rise of self-censorship.
“A different hue of censorship has arisen — one that is not from above but rather within,” says William Dobson, another co-founder of Aaliya’s Books. “We had some pushback from the staff before hosting pro-LGBTQ+ events.” While they had no issue with the events personally, Aaliya’s staff members lived in the conservative Dahiyeh district. “Concern arose about potential backlash from neighbors.” The team mitigated against potential backlash by reducing online publicity, giving staff the option not to work and covering the windows of the bookshop.



There is also a strong prevalence of online hate speech in Lebanon. “The Samir Kassir Foundation monitors daily violations,” Mhanna says. “We find they are most often directed towards LGBTQ+ communities and certain political groups.”
Occasionally, bookstores receive backlash. “Hateful comments were uploaded on Instagram after we made a tribute post about the passing away of Nawal El Saadawi, a vocal Egyptian feminist author, activist and physician who wrote on the subject of women in Islam, sexuality, patriarchy, class and colonialism,” Halabi tells me. Incidents such as these have led to bookshops taking more caution about what they publicize online or in their stores.



Authors are also unable to benefit from some of the liberties previously enjoyed by Lebanon’s printing and publishing scene. “Writers who dare to be transgressive often cannot find local publishers willing to take the risk,” says Joumana Haddad, an author and journalist whose feminist magazine Jasad has encountered significant backlash for covering topics like sexuality and erotica.
Haddad’s reading cafe, Cafebrairie 33, sells books you would struggle to find anywhere else in Lebanon. A quick scan of their shelves reveals copies of “Want: Sexual Fantasies by Anonymous” by Gillian Anderson and “Sex and Punishment” by Eric Berkowitz. Haddad hopes to eventually expand Cafebrairie 33 into a publishing house that supports dissident writers.



Although both state- and self-imposed censorship affect the literary sector, there are clear loopholes enabling people to publish and acquire sensitive materials. The greater challenges facing Lebanon’s literary scene — those that are far harder to overcome — stem from the multipronged crises facing the country.


“In the last six years alone, Lebanon has faced a revolution, a financial crisis, the port blast, COVID-19, political instability and a war,” recounts Eleena Sarkissian, editorial director of the publishing house Turning Point Books. These events have significantly inhibited the literary sector’s spending power and focus.


Halabi Bookshop started a monthly book club at its Beirut-based shop in May 2017. The team soon received requests to host the club throughout the country, with the founder first expanding to Tripoli for a few sessions before settling on permanent monthly fixtures in Sidon and Tyre.


Each month, attendees would read a prescribed book before participating in a group discussion. The conversations were lively, often erupting into furious debate and heaps of laughter, depending on the topic. “In each city, we had a different type of audience, which often meant the discussions varied,” Halabi explains. “In Tyre, our attendees were younger, while in Beirut, they were older and more mature. I was able to witness all of these rich conversations play out and use their insights to guide our other events.”


In October 2019, the revolution broke out. “We were at the ‘Death With Interruptions’ by José Saramago book club discussion in Beirut at the time,” Halabi recalls. “We could smell the tires burning.”
In the aftermath, roads were closed, making it hard for Halabi to travel to events outside of Beirut. COVID-19 restrictions, introduced in March 2020, further delayed the return of the book clubs.



“The worsening of the economic crisis and the Beirut port blast followed. The cost of travel and books increased — it became too expensive to run the events in all three locations,” Halabi says.
The tale Halabi tells rings true across the industry. Events were repeatedly cancelled, postponed or suffered from low attendance due to the ongoing crisis. Hook, located in Beirut’s southern suburbs, particularly struggled during Israel’s most recent war on Lebanon. 

Many of its core clientele were forced to flee the area. By the time the war ended, some customers had decided to move elsewhere.
Sourcing a reliable supplier became challenging, too. Before 2020, Aaliya’s was able to source books within a couple of weeks and benefit from at least 30-day payment terms. “Unfortunately, our supplier did not survive the crisis and we struggled to find a new one that offered the same service,” Fleming-Farrell recounts. “Suddenly, our books were arriving late or going missing. We were also having to pay up front, which limited our scope to stock a range of materials.”


Eager to support the local reading community, Fleming-Farrell would go out of her way to source books for customers. This meant employing informal routes, often asking individuals who were traveling to bring books from abroad. “I focused on getting the book into the person’s hands if they wanted it,” Fleming-Farrell says. “In those cases, it was rare to earn a profit from the sale.”


Financial issues were arising in all directions. “Our costs were increasing — I think our energy bills went up by 3,000% in three months,” Dobson adds. “Then the exchange rate was changing six or seven times a day.” These fluctuations made it difficult for the business to make any kind of financial projections. “We did not even know what the value of the money we were taking would be from one hour to the next.”


Sales and readership levels were falling dramatically, too. “We have had to halve our print runs,” says Sarkissian from Turning Point.
Some attribute declining sales to the rising popularity of alternative forms of entertainment. “Fewer people read today — they look for faster, less engaged activities online,” says Arij Shreim, head librarian at Barzakh. “TikTok, Instagram, YouTube videos are gaining popularity.”


Others cite the effects of psychological exhaustion due to the crises affecting Lebanon. Dobson recalls that people used to have more hope. “They were reading and engaging with issues; discussions at Aaliya’s would revolve around how to fix the crises facing the country.” As the situation worsened and the general mood became more futile, interacting with the cultural and literary scenes became less of a priority for some.


For the most part, however, Lebanon’s financial crisis was the leading contributor to declining sales. The general population, faced with mass inflation, depreciation of the local currency and the freezing of their access to deposits by the banks, had significantly reduced disposable income. This impacted their ability to invest in literature.
“Books are expensive, especially new ones,” Khabbazeh says. At Librairie Antoine, the biggest literary retailer in Lebanon, the average book costs between $15 and $20. Secondhand bookshops are slightly more affordable; at Kitabi, the average price of a used book is around $4. For context, the monthly minimum wage in Lebanon has only just increased in July from around $200 to $313.



Bookshops cut away at their own profit margins to remain affordable. “When we opened in 2016, the profit margin on a new book was around 25%-30%,” Fleming-Farrell says. “For context, in Ireland or the U.K., it is around 40%-50%. By the end of 2022, our margins had fallen to well below that.”
Despite their best efforts, Aaliya’s eventually made the decision to close their bookshop in December 2024, due to the mounting economic pressures. Faced with similar financial issues, Hook also chose to temporarily close in July.



Affordability issues not only impacted businesses but also readers themselves, because the city’s literary scene has limited access to free books. Beirut Municipality commissioned the Assabil Association, founded in 1997, to manage a public library network, providing them with spaces free of charge and minimal funding. After registering as an official nonprofit organization, Assabil was able to rely on private funding, too, eventually opening Monnot Library, Geitawi Library and Bachoura Library. Assabil’s mobile library, the “Kotobus” — a pun on “autobus” and “kotob,” meaning “books” in Arabic — has also served various regions in Lebanon since 2008.



While there is a clear appetite for these services — Assabil’s spaces had a total of 35,000 visitors and 25,000 books borrowed in the past year — there are significant limitations. A general consensus exists that there should be more public libraries to increase accessibility to literature, both in the capital and across the country. However, funding is limited. Assabil initially aimed to build 12 municipal libraries in Beirut alone, including in neighborhoods like Tariq al-Jadideh and Sassine, though these plans have yet to materialize. “There are no public spaces in Beirut because they have already been sold off to the highest bidder,” says Dobson.



A wider cultural shift is also needed in order to ensure people actually utilize the existing public libraries. “In Lebanon, people have a tendency to shy away from anything slightly public or governmental,” Khodor Al Akhdar, the manager at Barzakh, tells me. “There is an expectation that the libraries will not be taken care of or have the latest books.” This perception limits attendance at these spaces.


For the most part, the private sector fills the void. Guests at hybrid cafe-library spots like Barzakh and Riwaq are invited to pick a book from the shelves to read for free during their visit. It is common to find visitors hunting down a familiar, worn copy of a book to enjoy while drinking a cup of coffee. I have fond memories of visiting Barzakh myself while living in Hamra in 2021. Over the course of a month, I read “I Capture the Castle” by Dodie Smith in small installments.


During Israel’s latest war on Lebanon, a huge influx of refugees from the south of the country sought refuge in Hamra. “Once displaced, there was nothing they could do, other than waiting, so I offered to lend them books from Kitabi to read for free,” Khabbazeh says. Hundreds of books were borrowed from the shop by people staying within the 2-mile stretch of Hamra. They would read them within a day or two before coming back to exchange them for others.



When the ceasefire was announced in November 2024, those who had been displaced headed back to their homes immediately. By the time Khabbazeh returned to his bookshop at 10 a.m., over 150 of his books had already been returned to his neighbor next door. For Khabbazeh, it is instances like these that motivate him to continue.


Determined to cater to the region’s avid readers, Beirut’s surviving literary businesses have come up with inventive ways to stay afloat over the past few years. Kitabi Bookshop increased its social media presence, posting interviews with authors online and hosting events to encourage customers to visit. The team at Halabi Bookshop sought alternative methods to finance their operations. “In 2023, we secured a small grant and a microfinance loan,” Halabi tells me. The funds meant they could expand their operations; the team now has more space to smoothly fulfill book procurement orders for private and public libraries and institutions. They also grew their social media advertising efforts and offered books in nonconventional ways.


Publishers and printers learned to adapt. “We used to do a lot of guidebooks, but now people go online for that information,” Sarkissian tells me. “We started to publish more children’s books and self-help works.” Many of Lebanon’s printers shifted their focus in order to stay afloat. “We have worked with over eight printers in the past 20 years and, thankfully, none of them have been forced to close,” Sarkissian says. “Quite a few have specialized in making packaging for goods to bolster their incomes.”


Recently, there have been some promising signs of recovery. Halabi’s much-loved book club events, originally postponed due to the crises in the country, were resumed in 2024. They are now hosted every couple of months in Beirut, with the option for people to join online.


A similar event is gaining popularity at Curl Book and Coffee Shop in Badaro. When I visit, I find a cafe library packed with customers. The spot boasts modern interiors, with glittering wood-paneled walls and backlit bookshelves. Elena Ferrante’s “The Days of Abandonment” is laid out for sale; the work will be the focus of Curl’s next monthly book club event. I can already spot one customer reading the novel on the terrace outside.


As I relax in a corner nook, I spot two other visitors entering the shop. When an assistant asks if they are after anything in particular, they respond in unison: “We are just looking, thank you.” The pair peruse the collections intently, occasionally picking up a novel and reading a few pages. Neither of them purchases anything, but their interest is clear.
Beirut’s bookshelves may have gathered dust over the last few years, but it seems that readers are beginning to return. When they do, the city’s surviving spaces are ready to welcome them.

1ngr5h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/100kITCareerSecrets/comments/1ngr5h3/help_desk_hell/,Help Desk “HELL”!,"At some point breaking out of a dead-end help desk position is a MUST and requires a strategic approach to build skills, gain experience, and position yourself for higher-paying, more fulfilling roles in IT or related fields. Here’s a step-by-step guide based on current industry trends and practical pathways:

1. Assess Your Skills and Interests
•  Reflect on your strengths: Evaluate what you enjoy about your help desk role (e.g., problem-solving, customer interaction) and what you dislike (e.g., repetitive tickets, limited growth). This helps identify target roles like project management, business analysis, or tech sales.
•  Inventory your skills: Help desk roles often develop transferable skills like communication, troubleshooting, customer service, and familiarity with IT systems (e.g., ticketing software, basic networking, or cloud tools). These are valuable for non-technical or technical IT roles.

2. Upskill with Certifications
Certifications can open doors to new roles by validating your knowledge and showing initiative. Focus on affordable, recognized options that align with your career goals:
•  For non-technical roles:
	•  PMP (Project Management Professional) or CAPM (for beginners): Ideal for transitioning to IT project management ($100k+). Requires some experience, but help desk work counts toward it.
	•  CBAP (Certified Business Analysis Professional) or CCBA: Great for IT business analyst roles ($100k–$130k). Focuses on requirements gathering and process improvement.
	•  Salesforce Certified Administrator: Useful for tech sales or CRM management roles, especially in SaaS ($100k+ with commissions).
•  For technical roles (if interested):
	•  CompTIA Network+ or Security+: Entry-level for network or cybersecurity roles ($80k–$120k with experience).
	•  AWS Certified Solutions Architect or Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Cloud skills are in high demand for roles like cloud administrator ($100k+).
	•  ITIL Foundation: Focuses on IT service management, useful for process-oriented roles like IT service manager ($90k–$120k).
•  How to start: Use platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or LinkedIn Learning for affordable prep courses. Many certifications cost $100–$400 and can be completed in 1–3 months.

3. Gain Relevant Experience
•  Volunteer for projects at work: Seek opportunities to shadow or assist on IT projects (e.g., system upgrades, software rollouts). This exposes you to project management, business analysis, or vendor coordination, building experience for non-technical roles.
•  Take on leadership tasks: Offer to train new help desk staff, document processes, or lead small initiatives. This demonstrates leadership for roles like IT project manager or team lead.
•  Side projects or freelancing: For technical paths, build a portfolio (e.g., set up a home lab for networking or create scripts for automation). For non-technical paths, freelance in areas like CRM setup (e.g., Salesforce) or tech consulting via platforms like Upwork.

4. Network and Build Visibility
•  Leverage LinkedIn: Optimize your profile with keywords like “IT project management” or “business analyst,” and list certifications. Connect with recruiters, join IT groups, and engage with posts about your target roles.
•  Attend industry events: Look for local or virtual tech meetups, webinars, or conferences (e.g., CompTIA events or PMI chapters). Networking can lead to referrals for roles like tech sales or IT consulting.
•  Find a mentor: Reach out to colleagues or professionals in your desired role for advice. Many are willing to share insights over coffee or virtual chats.

5. Apply for the Right Roles
•  Target transitional roles: Look for positions like IT coordinator, junior business analyst, or technical account manager, which value help desk experience and pay $60k–$80k, serving as stepping stones to $100k+ roles.
•  Tailor your resume: Highlight transferable skills (e.g., “Resolved 500+ tickets, improving system uptime by 20%” or “Collaborated with cross-functional teams on software deployments”). Use tools like Jobscan to match job descriptions.
•  Explore internal opportunities: Check if your company has openings in IT project management, business analysis, or sales. Internal moves are often easier as you’re a known quantity.
•  Consider tech companies: Firms like Salesforce, ServiceNow, or AWS often hire for non-technical roles (e.g., solutions consultants, customer success managers) with help desk backgrounds, offering $100k+ with experience.

6. Develop Soft Skills
Roles like IT project manager, tech sales, or business analyst rely heavily on communication, problem-solving, and stakeholder management. Practice these by:
•  Improving presentation skills: Join Toastmasters or take online courses to boost confidence for client-facing or leadership roles.
•  Learning to negotiate: Critical for tech sales or consulting. Practice through role-playing or sales-focused courses.
•  Mastering time management: Use tools like Trello or Asana to organize tasks, showcasing project management potential.

7. Consider Adjacent Fields
If IT feels limiting, leverage your help desk experience for roles outside traditional IT:
•  Tech Sales: As mentioned, roles like SaaS sales can exceed $100k with commissions. Use your customer-facing experience to pitch solutions.
•  Customer Success Manager: Focuses on client retention and satisfaction for tech products ($90k–$140k). Your help desk empathy and problem-solving skills are directly applicable.
•  Technical Writer: Documents IT processes or software manuals ($80k–$120k). Strong communication skills from help desk work are a plus.

8. Stay Persistent and Track Progress
•  Set a timeline: Aim for a new role within 6–12 months. Break it down: 1–3 months for certifications, 2–4 months for networking, and 3–6 months for applying.
•  Track applications: Use a spreadsheet to monitor job applications, interviews, and follow-ups. Aim for 10–15 applications per week for roles like IT coordinator or junior analyst.
•  Handle rejection: View rejections as feedback. Ask recruiters for insights and refine your approach.
Example Path: From Help Desk to IT Project Manager
•  Month 1–2: Enroll in a CAPM or ITIL Foundation course ($200–$300, online).

I have fibromyalgia and one of the hardest symptoms for me is brain fog and mental fatigue. Sometimes I can’t focus at all, my memory feels like it’s failing, and studying for exams feels impossible. Even when I try to read or revise, my mind goes blank or I get overwhelmed.

I’ve tried small things like short breaks, drinking coffee, and making notes, but it’s still really tough. I know fibro is more than just pain, but I didn’t realize how much it would affect my mental focus and learning ability.

I’m curious:

How do you cope with brain fog while studying or working?

Are there any strategies, routines, or supplements that actually help you concentrate?

How do you manage the fatigue and avoid burnout when your energy is so limited?


Honestly, it’s really frustrating because I want to perform well in school/college/work, but my brain just doesn’t cooperate sometimes. Any tips, support, or advice would mean a lot.

1ngr292,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1ngr292/baby_mice_are_raining_from_my_ceiling/,Baby mice are raining from my ceiling,"Ok my post title is dramatic, but this ranks as about as high on the barf scale as I've ever experienced. Yesterday evening I spotted a dead/near dead baby mouse on the floor just outside my kitchen entry. I lost my shit (pretty sure I have a phobia) but my husband cleaned it up, thoroughly searched around the area. Google said there's likely a nest nearby, so he pulled out the fridge (lots of random old food but no signs of anything sus). Searched lower cabinets and nothing. (We've had issues in the past but have since gone OVER THE TOP with sealing up the house with steel wool + spray foam and eliminating any possible points of entry). I'm also super vigilant about cleaning and looking for signs. We have traps in place we've known them to enter in the past (also filled these spots with steel wool) and the traps have been untouched for close to a year, so I was so discouraged to think this baby got in somewhere we'd overlooked.

This morning (roughly 10 hours later), I go downstairs to get my coffee and... there's another dead baby in the same exact spot. Like the EXACT same spot. My husband did ANOTHER thorough search of the area and nothing - until we realized that the location 2x probably means the babies are falling from above, which happens to be the location of a small opening in the upper frame of the pocket door that leads to the kitchen. Bingo. 

Also worth noting that my husband and I spent the day yesterday adding insulation to the large living room on the other side of the house (i.e. we rented one of those machines from Home Depot, he removed the siding and cut a small hole in the wall, and we blasted in - no joke - 425 lbs of cellulose insulation). Now this is the complete opposite side of the house, but it seems too coincidental that we massively disturbed the ceiling on the same day it rains baby mice.

With the opening in the pocket door thoroughly filled with steel wool + spray foam, no further holes in the pocket door frame detected, am I dumb to feel like this problem has been solved? Assuming the mother is still in the ceiling, should we be extra vigilant if she tries to get out? Anything else I can do to ease my mind? ",1,1757855815.0,pestcontrol,3,1.0,False

Hello Reddit! Do you love romance ideas?Slow-burn romances? Hurt and comfort romances? Ohh, maybe a pregnancy romance idea? Well, I have ideas for all those categories! I'm not replacing any of my current partners or anything. I'm just posting the ideas floating around my head. Anyway, let's get to the important stuff! My name is Em, and I am a 22-year-old woman. I have been roleplaying for a long time. Like a very long time. I consider myself a novella-length writer. Which means I write around 500-2,000 words per post. I prefer to roleplay on Discord. I write exclusively in third person. I am an adult, so I will require that you are at least 22. I love chatting about our characters and sending TikToks or other stuff. Ohh, also the important part. I do enjoy smut, but I do a ratio of 80 percent story to 20 percent smut. That is not negotiable; I write for the joy of crafting a story, not to get off.



So to recap, here is what I'm looking for in a partner. Someone who is at least 22 years old. Someone who can match my length and writes exclusively in third person like I do. Someone who understands that these roles are not all smut. Someone who enjoys chatting and building friendships with their partners!Also, I understand you get busy, as I'm a college student and work full time, so if you are busy, just let me know! 

Also please use the password: Romance awaits. 



On to the roles! Now, I broke them up into categories to make it easier to understand. 
MMC is the male main character. 
FMC is the female main character. 




Pregnancy Plots:

1. The MMC is looking for a surrogate to help him start his family. Maybe his wife has passed, or maybe he is just tired of waiting for the one to come along. So he finds FCM through a surrogate agency and begins the journey to give him a family and much, much more.



2. MMC and FMC were a fling in college, and then they had a messy breakup. So she figured he wouldn't want anything to do with his special needs daughter. That is until they run into each other in a store years later. 



3. MMC and FMC work together. They actually despise each other. So much so that everyone in the office knows that. MMC pulls pranks on FMC just to piss her off. That is until FMC life falls apart. She was married, but then she found out her husband was cheating on her weeks after finding out she was pregnant. Her life falls apart. Little did she know the man she hated would be the one to help her put her life back together. 



Slow Burn plots:

1. FMC is a journalist, a reporter for a huge newspaper company. MMC is the famous person she is tasked with trying to get to agree to an interview. Fate has other plans, and the two end up in a love story fit for the times.  All the drama MMC has in the press is fabricated by FMC to save him. 



2. FMC is a world-class bull rider. When she is paralyzed in an accident. Her family hires FMC to help bring her out of her shell. The only problem is FMC hates MMC, but that slowly ebbs away. 



3. FCM is the queen of Scotland. The only child of the king and queen, she becomes queen after her mother's death. She is amazing at it, but to keep the country afloat, she must find a king. Her father arranges for her to marry the king of another country. Maybe Russia or England or something. FCM hates MMC with a passion. She wants to run the country because MMC cannot do it. So she spends her time planning to kill him. Unaware that MMC wants nothing to do with being king and would much rather study his hobbies. 



Hurt/comfort plots: 

1. MMC and FMC were best friends. They were inseparable until FMC was in a car accident after leaving MMC's party. He thinks he caused the accident, so he no longer speaks to her. That is until one day when he comes across her YouTube page that talks about her life and her love for him. 



2. FMC is homeless and injured, living in New York. She is barely surviving if she is being honest. Sure, she spends most of her money on drugs, but that's only because her leg doesn't hurt when she is high. One day she is trying to get a hot chocolate from a coffee shop while people grumble behind her. When it's not enough money, she just leaves. MMC watches the whole thing play out and decides he must help her. After all, he definitely has enough money to do so.



3. FMC has cystic fibrosis; she has made peace with dying. That is until she meets MMC, a vampire who now works at her job. He can't understand why she won't let him fix her. She can't understand why he cares enough to want to fix her. A beautiful love story is born. 



Enemies-to-lovers plots:


1 This one is truly an enemies-to-lovers idea. MMC is an awful person, a racist, a bigot, you name it. They are just awful.That is until they meet FMC, a woman who is everything they hate, but she isn't afraid to call him out on his wrongs. To change his mind. It's slow, it's ugly, and it's beautiful.



2. MMC and FMC families have hated each other for years. They don't really know why or understand it. Waking up one morning from a one-night stand, FMC is shocked to find MMC beside her. She vaguely remembers the night. The guy was smart, funny, and interested in her. Though she still hates him. This starts a very weird friendship with benefits that turns to more. 



3. FMC is a brutal serial killer. MMC is a cop tasked with getting FMC to help them catch a copycat killer. The two can barely stand each other, though in the hatred something else blooms.






Sample of my writing: 

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes—five minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.

The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left.

Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrain and slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.

Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.

That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.

It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.

That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world.  
""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.

Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.

The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.

PREGNANT.

In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.

All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow.  
With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.

Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end everyone with, ""Papa, loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.

1ngr1i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1ngr1i2/reveal_if_the_best_laundry_detergent_pacs_from/,Reveal if the Best Laundry Detergent Pacs from All Fresh Clean Truly Deliver,"I’ve been testing the all fresh clean 10072613739711 MIGHTY PACS Laundry Detergent for my day-to-day laundry needs, and I’ve gathered quite a few thoughts about what this product does well and where it maybe just misses the mark. Let me walk you through my experience using these detergent pacs over the past couple of weeks, from handling stubborn stains to navigating my family’s tendency to make messes on a regular basis.

**Power in a Tiny Pac**  
These compact detergent pacs pack quite a punch. The 5-in-1 formula is no joke—it genuinely lives up to its claim of lifting stains, brightening, whitening, freshening, and tackling deep-down odors. I have a toddler at home, which means I deal with a lot of what one might kindly call “creative stains” (think crayon streaks and ketchup splatters). These mighty pacs handled them impressively on most occasions. Whether I threw them into a cold wash for delicates or blasted ground-in dirt on rough and tumble play clothes with hot water, the detergent performed consistently well.  

[Check all fresh clean 10072613739711 price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b07rj7pchs/)

**Convenience That Saves Time**  
One of my favorite aspects of the detergent pacs is their simplicity. There’s no measuring, no mess, and honestly, no stress. I can never go back to guessing how much liquid detergent to pour in—it’s a single toss and done. Each pac dissolves fully in all my laundry cycles, which eliminated my earlier pet peeve of sometimes fishing out half-dissolved chunks of detergent from the washer. Plus, these pacs are formulated to work with all types of machines, including my HE model.

**Odor-Fighting Champion**  
Let’s just say odor-lifting has been thoroughly tested in my household. From sweaty gym clothes to kitchen towels that might’ve spent a day too long sitting in the laundry basket, this product really steps up. The freshness after a cycle isn’t overpowering but leaves a clean, neutral scent that doesn’t clash with my fabric softener. I even noticed a significant improvement with items that tend to retain weird smells, which was pretty satisfying.

**Performance Across Different Loads**  
I loaded up my machine with everything from thick bath towels to lightweight delicates, trying hot, warm, and cold-water settings. These pacs adapted to all water temperatures, even the delicate cold washes, without any compromise in the cleaning quality. The toughest test was my partner’s white shirts with some mystery coffee stains, and while not miraculous, it lightened them considerably in just two washes.  

**Good Points**  
• Effective at treating tough stains and odors  
• Mess-free single-dose design makes laundry easier  
• Works well in both cold and hot water  
• Dissolves completely in high-efficiency washers  

**Shortcomings**  
• Struggles slightly with deeply set stains on white fabrics  
• Lack of a more distinct scent option for personal preference  
• Only available in a 60-count tub, limits flexibility  

**Competing Products**  
If you’re looking into alternatives, brands like Tide Pods and Gain Flings come to mind. Both have their strengths, but I’d say the all fresh clean mighty pacs holds steady ground in terms of versatile stain-lifting power, especially for odors. Tide Pods may offer slightly better stain removal but tend to be pricier, while Gain Flings excel if you’re after strong, lingering scents. However, Tide and Gain lack the balanced, neutral scent that works so well for households that prefer more understated fragrances.

**Value Assessment**  
Given everything this product brings to the table—the reliable cleaning performance, odor-lifting technology, and ease of use—the price point feels justified. It isn’t necessarily the cheapest option out there, but for how much value is packed in each pac, it sits comfortably within an affordable range. You’d save time, effort, and even avoid accidental over-pouring, so it feels like a smart investment for anyone tired of dealing with liquid or powder detergents.

I (30) FM struggle with OCD, ADHD and depression for most of my life. I have this very beautiful life that I worked very hard for with a lot of ups and downs (like everyone) along the way. Im in my fifth year of my career as a teacher, I have wonderful friends and family, i live in a house where my roommate is never home, I have a beautiful puppy, my own finances, i travel and do fun things. But pushing myself when life is mundane feels close to impossible. Example: i’ve developed such bad habits since I was 17 that I now have at thirty like sleeping for hours when I get home from work.  I was a straight A party girl in college and still kept the habit got straight As and would sleep when I can and party all night. As I got out of my house, my habit got worse because now my mother is not here to yell at me- I also have an addiction to fast food which I developed over years. At one point, maybe three years ago I was really beautiful and now im overweight. Luckily, I went to the doctors and did all the blood work and they said everything looks good and that my cholesterol (i have genetically high cholesterol) is actually trending down! So I still have time to fix it!  Anywhere I go though, im thinking about sleep. I kill it at work, do a good job and then I can’t wait to get home and sleep for the night instead of being productive. If i go anywhere, im usually thinking about coming back and sleeping. The fast food thing is obvious. If i dont cook, i dont eat. Im to lazy to cook at times. I do try to meal prep Sundays for my week. I have been on meds for a long time. Im on 200mg of zoloft for ocd. Wellbutrin for depression and adhd, birth control and recently been prescribed aderall twice a day. One in the morning and one during an afternoon slump. ( I don’t drink coffee) lately, I find myself skipping the aderall in the afternoon because I actually look forward to going home and sleeping. After struggling with mental health for so long and going through hearbreak, struggles at work, etc. i finally feel like my nervous system is recovering and earned that rest but its ruining my life because i want to better myself. I don’t want to be this way. I want to live a life im excited about. I created a routine for myself that I am going to start tomorrow. It doesnt have to be perfect, I just have to start. Does anyone else have habits from this disorder that no longer serve them like sleeping that feel impossible to break? Im scared I’ll never change because sleeping became a safe place. What are some things you do to combat the extreme chronic fatigue and bad habits that come with this disorder? Thank you! ",2,1757855567.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

1ngqwxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AbioticFactor/comments/1ngqwxf/abiotic_factor_review_by_a_veteran_gamer/,Abiotic Factor Review by a Veteran Gamer,"Hello, fellow scientists!

I want to preface this review with a couple of personal informations  
Last few years have been hard on my gamer drive.   
Covid gave rise to cheap, janky, poorly made but funny, horror games best enjoyed in coop and that continued till 2025. WHile I had some fun with these games, their longevity in my brain space is of short breath. Their mechanics are ultimately simple and the gameplay loop is forgettable. 

I longed for the games where I could immerse fully, in a lengthy campaign of exploration, studying the map and tools to become better at it. My cold heart was in a BLACK HOLE, so to speak. 

And so 2025. happened and I was hit by a Holy Trio.   
First there was Blue Prince, then there was ClairObscur: Expedition 33, and from far side of the playing field came Abiotic Factor. And these three fully rejuvenated that sense of wonder, awe, drive not to sleep just so I can put another hour into it, they reignited my love for gaming all over again!

With that in mind, here is my full breakdown of Abiotic Factor, down to the last component: 

  
**Lingvisticaneus Machinations aka Story**

The subtle evolution and progression of the story is something I longed for since the dawn of my favorite game series - Legacy Of Kain.   
The starting mystery is great, what happened to the facilty? What is going on? What is over there? What is behind this corner? What is behind this door?   
The environmental storytelling is also great and it kept me immersed each time I started the game. 

It is zany, very reminiscent of the bygone age where nerds made games for nerds and it wholehartedly embraces this storyline. It feels like 90s child show but with a greater self-awareness of today.   
It is not a mindblowing story, per se, but it is nicely presented, better unrolling and hooks its hooks in my brains oh so effectively! A joy to experience!

**Geographical-Space Continuum aka Level Design**

Here it is: The crowing achievement of this small, insanely large simple complex game:   
The map. The interconnectivity between the secrtions. The functioning designs each with its own disting markings and environments. Finding ways to connect our small, efficient base in the Cafeteria (the very begining of the game) to the rest of the facility hit me with a dopamine that is equal to opening a GATCHA BOX or rolling for ultra rare characters. Simple fact that I passed ""Animal Pen"" doors so long, that the moment we opened them felt like I was opening a new mystery box, full of secrets, knowledge, loot and ultimately power to be harnessed for survival. And this repeats, over and over to a perfect game loop. Effective map design that rewards exploration, unique style and ""Spirit"" of each subsection is a joy to play in! Highest praises go here for sure! 

**The only negative is getting stuck on certain geometry spots, and the fact objects can drop through the floor. That is annoying as all hell.** 

**The Lazer Zappings and Explodey Things aka Gameplay**

Just like a head of a cabbage, the gameplay slowly unveils its subtle but efficient evolution over time. Learn by doing is something that I love as a concept when done right and here it is very well implemented. The gameplay itself is quite simple. We got our melee, our ranged, or throwables and everything in between. There is no DMC level style combat here, just jabs and stabs. We are after all a nerdy tech lab assistant in over their head. And yet, the enemies are what make the encounters feel greater than they are. Combination of first person, and highly mobile/tanky/nukging/blinking enemies keeps you on your toes all the time, and this just gets harder the deeper you go.  
Each time I died I felt like I did not plan too much. My group likes to fight head on, forgoing setting up intricate defences deep in enemy lines. Just frontal charges all day!  
And it works wonders!   
You will slowly learn of your evolving enemy patterns and organically start to position, dodge and block to minimize the FORTITUDE leving :)

Very simple, but  very addicting and highly actiony! 

**The Notational Sound Vibrations aka Music**

After Clair Obscur, no music can compare for now and AF is no different.   
I loved the enviromental audio queues, the Day/Night Warnings, the Portal World Reset timer announcements and enemy audio. This is the most important aspect of sound. By listening we knew what to expect and with that the audio is quite reminiscent of older games, both in voice acting, starting with our Poindexter's nerdy voice ""I think... I may need the facilities soon"" to listening to nicely acted out Dr. Manse's hologram info dumps that caused us to stop, and listen, almost like kids around a campfire, immersing in a story of mythical beings, carefully logged and explained by Dr. Manse.   
Nothing outstanding, but most importunately nothing negative. It serves its purpose well!  
  
**The Atmosphere aka the Atmosphere**  
What is that? Oh the air is green? Too bad, you are breathing in Premium Chernobyl Air now!  
The mood, the feel... Also one of the most immersive designs in a game recently!   
Each subsection of the labs has a discting aura about themselves, each speak of different events that befell the Gate Facility. Layered on top to expand the depth are the ""Weather effects"" that all have different degrees of impact. But all of them, limit your sight range in one way or another, letting you choose - do you turn it off or tank it out. This can make brightest and safest areas feel scary.  
And the game slowly progresses with its mood and atmosphere from a sciencey endevour, to panic horror screaming, to battlefield warfare, back to sciency exploration to some more snippets of horror and then the mix of them all.  I was after 100+ hours, thoroughly immersed in all its aspects  


**Logical Do-dads and Trinkets aka Overall Design Logic**

The premise is simple, delivered very effectively, and its openly asking the player to ENGAGE with its setting and story. Why and How is all layed out for you to find. You need to listen and you need to read. And not many games today DARE to ask for full attention, knowing full well that average gamer doesn't have the mental capacity or logistics to hold attention to a single thing over prolong periods of time.   
It is never handholdy, sometimes requiring to deduct certain pointers based on the info you have and combination of previous points made, its blended into a perfect salad, something I have never witness in my 35 years of gaming - An exploration, story based multiplayer survival crafting mystery box!!

Every aspect of it- slowly piecing together the events, just like piecing togheter an idea for a new piece of equipment works like wonders!

**But, it is not all perfect \*Scary horror noise\*** 

There are two points I want to tackle: End game stretch and Overall weapon balance.  


First, the deep voice in my head says that certain parts had less meat on them and felt just a bit too stretched thin. Mainly the point when finishing the \[REDACTORS\]. The transition to the Livlery felt a bit empty. Not many recipes are found and it feels that each new thing trickles out, slowly taking away that GATCHA styled fun of dopamine hit getting bunch of new toys to play with. It feels like there can and should be more things craftable. Specifically during that segment, not before!

Second part of things that are not very well designed, or at least took away from the final grading- weapon balance!  
Namely Sharp Weapons Big Variety and Power VS the Extremely limited and not so powerful Blunts. 

Blunts shine when charge attacking an enemy into a head, being able to one shot them clean.  
However, swinging a hammer, be it one or two hander, does not produce the damage to match what Sharps do. 

Bleeding an enemy severely and being able to swing 3x faster than a heavy hammer simply feels more engaging, and more powerful.

But the tech tree is also skewered towards sharps. A laser katana? That is very cool for my inner nerd. My other save as a Bluntozer? I get a charge hammer that needs ammo? And then it doesn't deal as much damage as it visually looks like it does. Not sure what impact hammer does either- deals more damage to low hp targets? Ok.... Other endgame options are... extremely early looking Exor Fail and Impact hammer. Comparatively in Heavy Section Carbon Pickaxe does way more damage  (25 more than Impact)  
And it goes further, last single handed blunt weapon deals 44 damage, looks like a starting weapon and has basic bleed effect.  
Last single handed sharp weapon is a SUPER COOL HARDLIGHT SABER, that deals two types of damage and can inflict HEAVY BLEED with having 30 more base damage over Exor Flail.   
Sharp Weapons also overtake throwing daggers I used, having a 50dmg Boomerang Quantum Icepick.   
All of the best weapons are sharp and they are cool on top of it. We need more techy hammers to balance out the field as it stands it is not properly designed. 

Final Word: After 100+h in Abiotic Factor I give this game  
**EXCELLENT - 9.2/10 overall score.**   
  
Certain misgivings can and should be ironed out in patches later down the line, and few kinks in the cogs are not big or scary enough to put this game down any lower. I recommend buying it if this is your type of a game because its a great fun in coop and a great experience that values immersion and engagement!

1ngqwia,https://www.reddit.com/r/FitchburgMA/comments/1ngqwia/finnish_marketplace_and_car_cruise_returns_to/,Finnish Marketplace and Car Cruise returns to Saima Park on September 21,"https://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/2025/09/14/finnish-marketplace-and-car-cruise-returns-to-saima-park/


A beloved tradition returns this fall as the Finnish Center at Saima Park hosts its annual Tori and Car Cruise on Sunday, Sept. 21, from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at 67 Scott Road.

In Finnish, tori means “open marketplace,” and this year’s event will once again showcase vendors of Finnish and Nordic goods, along with arts, crafts, books, music, and food.

“The first Tori was held in 1984, and every year we are thrilled to welcome back family and friends to shop for unique gifts, enjoy music, and try their luck at our raffles,” said board member Lorna Sulin. “Also, each year, we invite owners of classic vehicles to cruise on over to beautiful Saima Park to show off their prized possessions.”

Antique and classic cars, trucks, motorcycles, and mobile saunas are all welcome.


Guests can enjoy authentic Finnish salmon soup prepared by Saija Laurla, along with hot dogs, chicken soup, veggie chili, Finnish coffee bread, and cinnamon rusks.

Live music will fill the park with Finnish and Scandinavian flair, featuring the Oivan Ilo folk group from 11:15 to 12:15 p.m. and the Fitchburg State University Community Orchestra from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

“We are always excited to have Finnish and Scandinavian music during our festivals,” Sulin said. “It adds a bit of cheer and an ethnic flavor to the atmosphere.”

The marketplace will also feature vendors of foods, candies, gifts, glassware, novelties, and other items from Finland and Scandinavia sold by Gift Chalet, Sini Harjonmaa, and Katy Heiniluoma.


Of special interest to some will be Finnish knives and camping equipment, as well as replicas of Viking axes.

“Finns love their baked goods, and the Kitchen Garden and others will satisfy all with their selections of Finnish coffee bread, rye bread, almond cake and cupcakes, cinnamon rusks, and cookies,” Sulin said.

“All baking is done by the vendors, who have learned which goodies are most popular,” Sulin added. “Finnish coffee bread is a favorite of Finns as well as non-Finns. Most Finns and Finnish-Americans grew up eating cardamom-flavored coffee bread (“pulla” or “nisu”) and cinnamon rusks (“korppu”), often baked by their mothers or grandmothers, and are happy for the chance to taste it again. Another delicious favorite is almond cake.”

Son of a Bee’s Susan Parviainen will have honey, beeswax candles, hand cream, and her original cardamom creamed honey, as well as note cards and other items created by her daughter.


Linda Kiuru of Lark Knits has been busy knitting unique scarves, hats, and mittens in all shapes, sizes and colors, so we can all prepare for the coming winter.

Cara Staviski, of Finely Crafted by Cara, offers custom-crafted embroidery items such as clothing, linens and baby items, all with a Scandinavian flair.

Other vendors of arts and crafts include Karen Kemp and Carol Parker.

The Raivaaja Bookstore, which shares a long history with the Finnish Center, will have books and music for sale. In addition, they will run a short presentation about the endangered Lake Saimaa Ringed Seals, which live only in Karelia, and, meanwhile, will have a special section nearby for children to color and draw.

“Guests are urged to take this opportunity to visit our on-site Museum/Library,” Sulin said, “Which houses Finnish and Finnish-American books and artifacts, as well as the organization’s archives.”

All are welcome to become members of the Finnish Center at Saima Park, and there will be a membership table at the event. Annual dues are $30 per individual 18 years and older, payable by cash or check.

“The Tori is reminiscent of the busy outdoor marketplaces in Finland and other countries,” Sulin said with a smile. “It has become an event that people of the community look forward to attending to find a large variety of items that are not typically found in stores. It’s a good place to find special gifts.”

Please note that this event will be held rain or shine under the outdoor pavilion.

Not all vendors are equipped to accept credit cards. Parking and admission are free.

Firstly i want to say that I’m really enjoying this app. Im picking up words fast and easily, and I’m really enjoying the time I spend doing so. (Which tbh is waaaay too much. My screen time this week was painful to look at lol) 
Ive had this app for 4 days, so maybe too early to write a review but the brain worms are back and i have no choice. Here is what I’ve found while playing!
(For context, i’m operating the game on an iphone 12 and learning Japanese. Ive been learning off apps and YouTube for a while now. Also I know nothing about game development. So I have no clue how realistic the implementation of some of my suggestions are.)

*************************************************
Bug report 

Sometimes when spawning into the “home” map, jump size will be limited. This can also happen when changing the size of the alien.  

Coffee cup in the kitchen of the home map is too small for the the to fit in it. Because of this the speed boost is unable to be attained (like with the giant coffee cup on the roof of the town map)

Sometimes when an answer is wrong, it will show the correct answer but not the answer i gave. This means I cannot compare them to see what i got wrong. 

When fighting, sometimes it will mark answers (for sentence questions) as wrong even when they are correct. While this is a semi-consistent thing, I haven’t been able to find any patterns for it. 

In the living room of the home map, a set of books on the big bookshelf is always rendered half way through a shelf. 

If main volume is completely down, there is still sound when a question is correctly answered and when practice is finished. All the fight noises, bubble sound from the coffee mug effect, and NPCs talking are there as well. 


Japanese specific bugs

During the task where you are practicing month names in the office, the voice over says “じゅうにつき” instead of “じゅうにがつ” 
I am unsure if this is correct, but the text does say じゅうにがつ and thats what I’ve always been taught. 
In the same exercise, the voice over says what i think is さつき for ごがつ. Again, the text has the latter. 



*************************************************
Feature requests 

With practices I would love to be able to select what words I practice. Some suggestions for this function would be custom sets, filtering word by how many points they have or by how often they are gotten wrong. Maybe having all of these as options? This would be very helpful. 

In sound settings, could we have a slider for the voice sound level? Having this separate from sound effects would be good. Also an option for no sound? Sometimes I want to listen to music while I play, and sound effects get annoying. 

Including an Spaced Repetition System would be amazing, I think Earthlingo would benefit having one. Im not sure how big of an ask this is, but I’m sure people would appreciate having it if it was implemented. 

Could you add a setting for turning the day night cycle off? It’s a cool feature, but sometimes i do just want it to be day all the time. 

Sometimes when doing the search practices, I’ll accidentally select something when moving around and therefore get the word wrong. This is really annoying, so to fix it, could you please make it so that during search practice an item has to be double tapped to be selected as an answer?

When selecting a word (while not in a practice session) could there be an option to mark it as known? For example, if someone already knew numbers and a lot of fruit names, they could mark them as “known” or “mastered” and not spend as much time on them. 
While this could be used to mark off words not yet known to unlock levels faster, I do think learners who actually want to use this app to learn seriously will not abuse this feature and it’ll be worth it. 



Thankyou again for your work on the game, from what little i do know, making an app is a lot of work! A lot of my suggestions and reports you may already be aware of, but I hope some of this has been helpful. ",1,1757855258.0,Earthlingo,0,0.99,False

ECHO IN THE SYSTEM  
Chapter 1: The Weight of Routine

The storm had been building since midnight, Katie Morrison noticed as she pulled into the parking lot of her apartment complex at 5:15 AM. Lightning flickered in the distance like a faulty fluorescent bulb, illuminating the underbelly of clouds that hung over the Maryland countryside like a gray shroud. The air itself felt electric, charged with the kind of atmospheric tension that made her skin prickle and her coffee taste metallic.

She'd been awake since 4:30, not by choice but by the persistent anxiety dreams that had plagued her sleep for months. Always the same scenario: standing in a vast server room while alarms blared, knowing something catastrophic was happening but unable to identify the threat. Dr. Sarah Chen, the NSA's staff psychologist, had suggested the dreams were manifestations of professional frustration. Katie suspected they were omens.

Her white Corolla a practical choice that screamed ""government employee"" to anyone paying attention started on the second try, the engine turning over with the reluctant wheeze of a vehicle that had seen too many early mornings and late nights. The radio crackled to life as she backed out of her parking space, the morning DJ's artificially cheerful voice announcing that today would reach ninety two degrees with humidity that would make it feel like swimming through soup.

The drive to Fort Meade took exactly thirty seven minutes in light traffic, a routine so ingrained that Katie could navigate it while her mind wandered to more pressing concerns. Like the fact that her student loan payments were increasing next month. Like the way Gerald Marsh had looked at her during yesterday's staff meeting not with anger, which she could have handled, but with the cold satisfaction of someone watching a slow motion car crash of their own creation.

She parked at the 7 Eleven three blocks from the NSA complex, another ritual in her carefully orchestrated morning routine. The Pakistani owner, Rashid, greeted her with a tired wave from behind bulletproof glass that had been installed after the third robbery in two years. His English was heavily accented but his understanding of regular customers was perfect.

""Two coffees, two sugars, extra cream for the guard,"" he said before she could speak, already reaching for the cups. ""And one blueberry muffin, warmed for thirty seconds.""

""You know me too well, Rashid,"" Katie replied, handing him a twenty dollar bill. The transaction was as familiar as breathing she'd been stopping here every morning for seven years, and Rashid never failed to remember exactly what she needed.

""Routine is good,"" he said, counting out her change with hands that bore old scars from what she'd heard was a factory accident in Karachi decades ago. ""Routine means stability. Stability means safety."" The words stuck with her as she drove the final three blocks to the NSA facility. Routine meant safety, but it also meant predictability. And in her line of work, predictability could be dangerous for all the wrong reasons.

The sprawling complex of concrete and steel dominated this corner of Maryland like a monument to American paranoia and technological supremacy. The main building rose twelve stories above ground though Katie knew there were at least four more levels below the surface, buried deep enough to survive everything from nuclear strikes to electromagnetic pulses. The architecture was pure functionality over form: blast resistant walls three feet thick, windows made of bulletproof polymer that could stop armor piercing rounds, and more security cameras than the entire city of Baltimore.

As she approached the guard house, Katie could see Jimmy Castellanos through the reinforced glass, already standing at attention despite the early hour. At sixty two, James ""Jimmy"" Castellanos was an institution at the facility, a former Marine who'd been protecting America's digital secrets since before most of his colleagues were born. His weathered face deeply lined from thirty years of early mornings and the kind of constant vigilance that came with knowing exactly what horrors existed in the world brightened when he recognized her approaching vehicle.

""Good morning, Jimmy,"" she called out cheerfully, extending the cup of coffee and muffin through her rolled down window. The coffee was still steaming in the cool morning air, and she could smell the sweet, comforting aroma mixing with the scent of approaching rain and the faint chemical tang of nearby highway traffic.

Jimmy's acceptance of the offering was part of a dance they'd been performing for seven years, ever since Katie had started working at the facility and noticed that the security guard never seemed to eat anything during his twelve hour shifts except vending machine food and whatever bitter brew passed for coffee in the guard station.

""Good morning, Katie. You're far too good to me, you know that?"" His voice carried the slight rasp of a former smoker two packs a day for fifteen years until his daughter Carmen had given him an ultimatum five years ago: cigarettes or the privilege of meeting his grandchildren. The choice had been easier than quitting.

Jimmy took a careful sip of the coffee, his eyes closing briefly in appreciation. Perfect temperature, extra cream, two sugars she'd memorized his preferences years ago, the same way she memorized system configurations and security protocols. Details mattered in her world, whether they involved network vulnerabilities or human kindness.

""Just returning the favor for all those late nights you've covered for me,"" she replied, though the tired smile didn't quite reach her green eyes. The smile felt practiced now, part of the emotional armor she wore each morning to face another day in what had become professional purgatory. ""Besides, Maria makes you pack those healthy lunches. Someone needs to make sure you get a proper sugar fix."" Jimmy chuckled, a deep rumble that seemed to come from somewhere near his boots. ""Don't let her hear you say that. She's got me on some Mediterranean diet now all olive oil and fish and vegetables I can't pronounce. I swear, if I have to eat one more piece of salmon, I'm going to start swimming upstream to spawn.""

Katie laughed despite the weight of dread that had been pressing on her chest since the previous afternoon. It was the first genuine emotion she'd felt since her alarm had jolted her awake, and for a moment, the world felt almost normal. Almost.

""Well, consider this your rebellion for the day,"" she said, watching him unwrap the muffin with the careful precision of someone who'd spent his career handling explosives and understood that the smallest details could mean the difference between life and death.

""Our little secret,"" Jimmy winked, then walked back to his booth with the measured steps of someone whose left knee had been held together with titanium and hope since a roadside bomb in Desert Storm had filled it with shrapnel that military doctors said would never fully heal. The injury flared up before storms, turning each step into a small act of defiance against age and circumstance.

He pressed the button that would swing open the massive steel gate, the hydraulic system groaning to life with a sound like a sleeping giant awakening. The gate itself weighed three tons and could stop a fully loaded truck traveling at highway speeds, though Katie had never wanted to test that particular specification.

She drove through the checkpoint, her tires transitioning from the rough asphalt of the public road to the smooth surface of government property. The change was subtle but symbolic crossing from the civilian world into the realm of classified information and national security, where even the pavement was designed to military specifications.

Her assigned parking space B47, the same spot she'd occupied since her first day seven years ago sat near the main entrance, close enough to the building that she could run for cover if necessary but far enough from critical infrastructure that her car wouldn't become shrapnel in the event of an attack. Even parking spaces at the NSA were matters of strategic planning.

The morning air was thick with humidity and the promise of storms as she stepped out of the Corolla, her breath visible in small puffs that dissipated quickly in the oppressive atmosphere. She locked the car with a sharp electronic chirp that echoed off the concrete walls and began her walk to the main entrance, her heels clicking a steady rhythm against pavement that had been swept and inspected twice since midnight. Other early arrivals moved with the same purposeful gait a small army of analysts, technicians, linguists, and administrators who kept America's intelligence apparatus running twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty five days a year. She recognized most of them by sight if not by name: Dr. Elizabeth Stone from the cryptanalysis division, always carrying a leather briefcase that never left her side; Marcus Johnson from signals intelligence, perpetually wearing headphones that leaked the tinny sound of intercepted communications; Sarah Kim from the China desk, whose ability to speak six dialects of Mandarin made her one of the most valuable assets in the building.

The main entrance was a masterpiece of intimidation disguised as civic architecture. Polished marble floors reflected the harsh LED lighting that had replaced the old fluorescents in a building wide efficiency upgrade two years earlier. American flags hung from the ceiling at precise intervals, each one positioned according to regulations that specified everything from height to angle to the frequency of replacement. The message was clear: this was serious business conducted by serious people who took their responsibilities to the nation with deadly earnestness.

Katie approached the turnstiles with the automatic movements of someone who'd performed this ritual thousands of times. Her badge embedded with more security features than most national currencies triggered sensors that verified her identity, clearance level, and authorization to be in the building at this particular time. The system processed her information in microseconds, cross referencing her biometric data with files that contained everything from her college transcripts to her dental records.

She placed her right index finger on the biometric scanner, feeling the familiar tingle as infrared sensors mapped the unique patterns of ridges and whorls that had been her personal signature since birth. Above her, brass letters three feet tall caught and reflected the LED lighting: NSA. The National Security Agency. The organization that collected more intelligence information every day than had existed in the entire world a century ago.

At twenty nine next Friday, she reminded herself with the kind of dread usually reserved for medical procedures or tax audits Katie Morrison couldn't shake the feeling that her life had become a case study in wasted potential. Her graduate school classmates were running cybersecurity firms, making six figure salaries in Silicon Valley, or working for prestigious consulting companies where they traveled internationally and solved the kinds of complex problems that got written up in industry magazines.

Meanwhile, she was entering data in a windowless room three stories underground, watching her technical skills atrophy like unused muscles while her career flatlined in spectacular fashion. The contrast between her training and her current assignment was so stark that she sometimes wondered if she was being punished for something she couldn't remember doing. The elevator banks were arranged with military precision, each car assigned to specific floors and clearance levels. Katie's badge granted her access to floors B1 through B4 the basement levels where the real work of data processing and analysis took place, far from the executive offices and briefing rooms where decisions were made by people who hadn't looked at raw intelligence data in decades.

She pressed the button for B3, feeling the familiar sensation of descent as the elevator dropped below ground level. The walls were lined with sensors that could detect everything from concealed weapons to unauthorized recording devices, and Katie had heard rumors that the elevators themselves were equipped with systems that could render unconscious anyone whose biometrics indicated hostile intent.

The sub basement corridor was a study in institutional beige, painted in a shade that some government designer had probably called ""warm neutral"" but which Katie had long ago dubbed ""existential dread."" The walls were lined with motivational posters that seemed designed by committee: ""Vigilance is the Price of Freedom,"" ""Your Mission Matters,"" and Katie's personal favorite, ""Security Through Information Superiority.""

Fluorescent lights flickered to life as motion sensors detected her presence, gradually bringing the space to full illumination. The air down here felt processed, cycled through filters and scrubbers until it lost any hint of the outside world. It was climate controlled to precise specifications temperature maintained at exactly 68 degrees Fahrenheit, humidity at 45 percent, air pressure slightly elevated to prevent contamination from entering through microscopic gaps in the building's construction.

Her workstation was one of forty three in the cavernous room, each separated by low gray partitions that provided the illusion of privacy while ensuring that supervisors could monitor their charges with casual glances. The ergonomic chair the government's one significant concession to employee comfort adjusted to her body with the precision of German engineering, though no amount of lumbar support could address the psychological weight of spending her days in what amounted to a digital coal mine.

Katie powered up her computer and settled in for the boot sequence that would take exactly four minutes and thirty seven seconds. She knew the timing because she'd been counting for months, the way prisoners mark time on cell walls. The system would run seventeen different security checks, verify her credentials against twelve separate databases, and scan her workstation for any unauthorized devices or software before allowing her access to the networks that contained America's most sensitive secrets. As she waited, Katie caught her reflection in the dark screen: tired green eyes that had once sparkled with ambition and intelligence, skin that was pale from too many hours under artificial light, and the beginnings of lines around her eyes and mouth that served as a timeline of her frustration and disappointment. She looked older than twenty nine, worn down by the grinding routine of unfulfilling work and the constant awareness that her talents were being systematically wasted.

The computer hummed to life with a sound like a distant jet engine, cooling fans spinning up to manage the heat generated by processors that were more powerful than the supercomputers that had once filled entire buildings. As the system loaded its array of security software and network connections, Katie mentally prepared herself for another day of data entry that would challenge neither her intellect nor her skills.",1,1757855152.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

A short introdution since this is my first post here Reddit. My name is Mike (or Mikael here in Sweden) and I'm a swede who rally loves cool hardsurface design, industrial design and that sort of stuff. I'm kinda a old-timer in those fields with around 20 years experience from a number of industries, right now I'm at Embark Studios working on THE FINALS togheter with the most amazing and devoted crew.

I have a real weak-spot for mechas and cool robots. Like really. Think Mech Prawn/Biosuit from District 9 and Moose from Chappie. That really fires me up!

So this summer I decide to start sketching on a big cool character myself and spent most of the summer nights creating BRUTE BOY. Wonderful process and very fun!

Once the concept was set and locked in I got an urge to turn it into a model-kit. So I got a A1 mini, felt like a good place to start at, since I've never done any 3D printing.  
But now I'm so hooked. This is just so exciting and fulfilling. CAD-to-part in just a few hours. A really awesome way to develop a design in no-time. To be able to iterate on a design this fast is a real game-changer for me.  
I CAD a detail, print it, sketch on the part with a white prismacolor pencil, make changes, print again, evaluate, cad, print, cad until I really like it and it feels ""right"".

So I thought, since I've learned so much by reading here, that I would share my process here and give some behind-the-scenes on my workflow, mistakes and design-process to a finished design.

My goal is to launch a Kickstarter-campaign and spred my passion for advanced model-kits with both STLs and a complete, printed kits.

The first images are from from my design process.

1ngqr65,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedItRatedIt/comments/1ngqr65/explore_the_best_over_ear_headphones_anker_space/,Explore the Best Over Ear Headphones Anker Space One Worth It,"Testing out the Anker Soundcore Space One Pro headphones has been quite the experience. These over-ear headphones come fitted with a host of features aimed at delivering premium sound quality and comfort while making them practical for everyday use. The foldable design, advanced noise-canceling capabilities, long battery life, and fast charging all add to their allure. However, there are a few areas where they could improve. Here’s an in-depth look at my experience with this product.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The foldable design of the Soundcore Space One Pro is a game-changer for someone like me, who’s always on the go. The FlexiCurve structure reduces the headphones’ size by half, making them incredibly compact for easy packing. Tossing them into a bag filled with laptops, notebooks, and random items is no longer a hassle. The premium materials used to craft the headphones provide a durable yet soft protective shell, which reassures me they’ll withstand regular use without picking up scratches. That said, while I admire the space-saving feature, the plastic hinges give off a slight fragility vibe. I’d prefer a little more reinforcement there to avoid stressing about accidental drops.

**Performance and Noise Cancellation**  
The noise-canceling performance is where these headphones truly shine. Utilizing a 4-stage adaptive noise cancellation system, they managed to filter out a wider range of surrounding noise, whether I was in a bustling coffee shop or on a noisy flight. It was uncanny how effectively it muted random chatter or engine hum in real-time, even when I was in constant motion. I let my coworker borrow them for an hour during a meeting, and their feedback matched mine—impressive sound isolation. The downside, however, is that the ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) could sometimes feel a tad over-aggressive, distorting lower-pitched sounds in tracks. This might bother audio purists.

**Sound Quality**  
Rich, lossless, and beautifully balanced audio is how I'd describe the listening experience. The Space One Pro’s drivers use triple composite diaphragms, creating an audio balance that’s perfect for most genres. I spent hours rediscovering old playlists, from bass-heavy hip-hop to more intricate classical symphonies, without missing a beat. LDAC mode for Hi-Res audio adds a whole new dimension to sound quality, making even the smallest details in tracks pop. If I had to nitpick, I’d say the bass can sometimes overpower the mids when ANC is on. It’s not deal-breaking, but worth calling out.

[Check Anker Soundcore Space One Pro price on Amazon.](https://beatpops.com/p/b0dg8pth93/)

**Battery Life**  
Few things are as annoying as having your headphones die mid-flight—thankfully, that’s no issue here. With an impressive 40 hours of playback with ANC on and 60 with it off, these headphones are pretty much endurance champions. I didn’t believe the hype about fast charging until I tried it after forgetting to charge before heading to the gym. Five minutes of charging gave me eight hours of playback. Whether you’re a heavy music consumer or use them sparingly, this feature alone could justify the purchase. Still, there’s no wireless charging feature, which feels like it could’ve been a natural fit here.

**Key Benefits**  
- Remarkable foldability for secure storage and space-saving.  
- Superior noise canceling that dynamically adapts to surroundings.  
- High-quality audio, even in Hi-Res LDAC mode.  
- Extended battery life with ultra-fast charging capabilities.   

**Flaws**  
- Plastic hinges could be sturdier.  
- Noise cancellation can distort lower-pitched sounds.  
- Slightly bass-heavy with ANC on, affecting midranges.  
- No wireless charging option despite advanced features.  

**Competing Products**  
I compared the Space One Pro to industry heavyweights like the Sony WH-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort 45. In atmosphere control, these headphones hold their ground. Bose edges them out with slightly better noise-canceling precision, particularly in high-frequency environments. Sony, on the other hand, delivers a more neutral soundstage and richer app-based customization. However, the Soundcore Space One Pro outshines them with its ridiculously compact foldable design and unbeatable fast-charging capabilities. It may not have as polished an app experience as Sony or Bose, but in terms of bang for your buck, it’s hard not to appreciate the robust feature set offered here.

**Bang for the Buck**  
The value of these headphones lies in their balanced mix of premium features and a price tag that doesn’t break the bank like competitors do. They feel premium without that stomach-dropping guilt that sometimes comes after buying super-expensive gadgets. Considering its foldable body, premium sound quality, and advanced noise cancellation, the overall price-to-quality ratio is rather favorable. That said, I wish some refinement had been added to the app controls to match competitors in the same price range.

1ngqqwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermiculture/comments/1ngqqwj/starting_up_questions/,Starting up questions.,"I have been working on composting veg food waste without attracting rats.  
I have a home bodged tumbler for garden waste.  
I have a garage and have been trying bokashi..... I really don't know why I didnt start a wormery to start with.......

I got some worms for the garden and some for this. I got night crawlers. I have put a bunch in the garden and I am guessing I kept back about 100-150 to start me off. I have put them in a mini wormery to look after them while I work it out.

I am looking to see what I have that I can use/bodge to make one.  
I have realised my questions:

a. what sort of size am I looking at for just me?  
I have coffee grounds each day and the filters. I make most meals from scratch, so have veg ends and peelings, apple cores etc. But it is not HUGE amounts. I am thinking a bit bigger is better and they will self regulate? Although smaller with more layers gives a quicker turn around, right? More adaptability?  
b. What sized holes am i looking at at the bottom to stop them falling into the very bottom drainage box?  
I am thinking i will be drilling holes or putting a mesh.  
c. You know that they crawl up into the next box when the bottom one is full? Does it matter if there is an air gap between the boxes? Or does the upper one sit on the top of the soil of the next one down?

1ngqqbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1ngqqbm/aita_for_having_an_affair_that_led_to_my/,AITA for having an affair that led to my mother-in-law stealing my daughter?,"My mother-in-law made me sign custody papers for my daughter while I was still bleeding from childbirth.

I know how that sounds. But hear me out.

Three years ago, I was stuck in a dead bedroom marriage. My husband hadn't touched me in months. We were basically roommates who shared a mortgage. Then I met someone at my gym. Just a guy who actually looked at me like I was worth something.

It started innocent. Coffee after workouts. Talking about our failing marriages. His wife was cheating. My husband acted like I didn't exist. One night after too many drinks, we crossed the line.

""This stays between us,"" he said afterward. ""No feelings. Just two people who need something their spouses won't give.""

I agreed. What else could I do? Divorce wasn't an option. My husband's family basically owned the town we lived in. His mother was a judge. His brother was the police chief. They'd destroy me if I tried to leave.

The affair went on for six months. Then I missed my period.

The timeline was the problem. My husband and I had sex exactly once in the past year. His birthday. Three weeks after I'd started sleeping with my gym friend. If I was pregnant, the math didn't add up.

I took five tests. All positive.

""We can figure this out,"" my gym friend said when I told him. ""I'll leave my wife. We'll start over.""

But two days later, his number was disconnected. His social media vanished. The gym said he'd canceled his membership. He just disappeared.

I was alone and pregnant with another man's baby.

My husband noticed my morning sickness before I could figure out what to do. He was thrilled. ""Finally! Mom's been asking when we'd give her grandchildren.""

I should have told him then. But I was scared. His family had connections everywhere. What if they took everything? What if they made sure I never worked in this state again?

So I kept quiet.

The pregnancy was hell. Not physically. Mentally. Every ultrasound felt like a lie. Every time his mother touched my belly and talked about ""her grandbaby,"" I wanted to scream.

""You're glowing,"" she'd say. ""This baby is such a blessing.""

My husband doted on me. Suddenly interested in our marriage again. Building a nursery. Picking names. The guilt ate me alive, but I was in too deep.

Then came the birth.

The moment they placed her on my chest, I knew. She looked nothing like my husband. Different nose. Different chin. Even the nurses exchanged glances.

My husband was too emotional to notice. But his mother saw it immediately.

""She needs to rest,"" she told everyone. ""Give us a minute.""

When we were alone, she pulled out her phone. Showed me security footage from our gym. Me and him in the parking lot. Her investigator had been following me for months.

""I know whose baby this is,"" she said. ""And unless you want to lose everything, you'll do exactly what I say.""

She made me sign papers. Temporary guardianship. ""Just until you recover,"" she said. I was exhausted, bleeding, hormones everywhere. I signed.

The baptism was six weeks later. The whole family came. My husband's cousins, aunts, uncles. Everyone cooing over the baby.

Then he walked in.

My gym friend. With his wife. And their kids.

Turns out, he was my husband's cousin from out of state. The cousin nobody had seen in years because of some family drama. He'd been in town for business, joined my gym, and never mentioned his last name.

His wife saw my face and knew immediately.

""You,"" she said. ""You're the whore he was seeing.""

The church went silent.

""Is that why the baby looks just like him?"" she screamed.

My husband looked at me. Then at his cousin. Then at our daughter.

The next hour was chaos. DNA tests demanded. Divorce papers filed that same week. His mother used those guardianship papers to file for full custody. Said I was an unfit mother who'd committed fraud.

My own family disowned me. ""How could you do this to such a good man?"" my mother said.

The court gave his mother temporary custody during the divorce. Then permanent custody after. I got supervised visits. Two hours every other Sunday.

My daughter is five now. She calls my ex-husband's mother ""Mama"" and me by my first name.

Last week at pickup, she asked why I don't live with them anymore.

""Because she made bad choices,"" my ex-mother-in-law said, staring right at me.

My daughter nodded like she understood. ""Okay Mama.""

I haven't stopped crying since.

The worst part? My ex-husband's cousin faced zero consequences. His wife took him back. They moved away. Posted family Christmas cards last year like nothing happened.

But I lost everything. My home. My daughter. My family. Everything.

So reddit, AITA for not fighting harder to keep my daughter when I knew the truth would come out eventually anyway?

I have been eating a fast food burger, double meat patty with cheese, tomatoes, onions and thousand island sauce ( no fries or soda)
I have it for lunch almost everyday for about a few weeks now as it became almost a comfort food order.
I'm 70kg and 168cm in height so I'm not overweight but maybe could lose around 2-3kg if I wanna look great.

For breakfast I have coffee and that's it (maybe oatmeal on some days and usually at night I'd have eggs and greek yogurt, maybe some turkey lobes with cheddar cheese on rice cakes.

My daily intake is around 2000 calories and I think I've been maintaining that

1ngqc94,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ngqc94/aitah_for_wanting_my_mom_to_kick_my_brother_out/,AITAH for wanting my mom to kick my brother out?,"So before I (22, f) begin, some context. My brother (20, m, let’s call him Brad), has been an issue in the house ever since he moved in. He suddenly came up here from down south. My mother didn’t raise him either. She gave him and another one of my siblings (who I consider estranged) up so they could live better lives. Both have turned out to be complete pieces of work. Since he’s been up here, things have been a mess. Him and I got into an argument because I caught him talking bad about my mother. She originally messaged him to tell him he needed to leave at the end of October but now she’s saying she wants him to stay so they can build a bond. My other sister, let’s call her Isa, rarely wants to be around the house because of him. 

Now, here is a list of things that he has done. 

1. Brad moved up here with barely any money and had to borrow a ton of money from my mother to pay for his insurance, car payment, and tests for his nursing job. Just the insurance and car payment was $500. 

2. Brad was doordashing and asked Isa to go to with him. He took three dashes then decided he wanted to eat. Isa suggested McDonalds since it’s cheap. He invited her to eat and so she assumed he’d pay for himself and she’d pay for herself (we also have a shared bank account). He took her to an expensive sushi place and the entire meal was $66. My sister and I had $100 in the bank account. 

3. He took some of Isa’s tea without asking and poured it into his drink at the sushi shop because he didn’t like how strong his coffee was. 

4. Brad didn’t want to bring Isa back home (I lived an hour away at the time, drove there, and drove back home) after begging to let her go with him. I had to give my mom gas money that I barely had to bring her out (only because I would’ve felt bad if I didn’t pay her something). 

5. I left the house from 8am-7pm to dog sit. I woke up a little late (my fault) so I didn’t have time to eat. I snacked a bit per the clients permission but did not eat fully I came home and he began chasing me around when I took the last bit of food my dad made. He had been up for hours and had the excuse of “I’m about to work 12 hours” as an excuse. 

6. He keeps overspending and complaining about not having enough money. Brad also hasn’t paid my mother for rent recently. 

7. Brad does nothing to help around the house except the dishes when my mom has to tell him 100 times. 

8. He has continuously came into the living room, being loud, with Isa sleeping on the couch. He comes around 6-7 am. 

9. The youngest in our family gave her room to Brad could have his own room. Our cousin had the other room. She moved out. Brad wanted to move to that room and kept whining about it cause he’s older. The rooms are the same size. 

10. Brad wants us to go to an amusement park with Halloween events. None of us can because we work during the week and the park is two hours away. It’s also $50 a ticket. He called us all “Debbie downers”.

11. Brad begged Isa and I to come work in the medical field with him for weeks. Neither of us have any interest in medical or hospitality and kept telling him no. 

12. He constantly says he doesn’t have enough money to pay my mother back but spends his money on Sonic and other expensive places.  

13. Brad finally came out of his bedroom at dinner time, complaining about how my mother is cooking right before he has to leave for work. Brad always leaves 30 minutes before he has to be work for a 45 minute drive. 

This is what results in this post and my final straw. Also what I referenced to in the beginning. 

A few days ago, I was in the kitchen and overheard him talking to his friend about how my mother says he has no work ethic. He’s called in multiple times in the last month and a half he’s been here. He started the job August 6th. The friend asked Brad if my mother had a job. He said yes, she works at [retail store]. The friend goes “well she can shut the fuck up, you’re out here saving lives.” Brad works in an old folks home. And I’m not saying nurses in nursing homes are any less than other nurses but it isn’t like he’s cutting edge, assisting in life saving procedures. My mother’s job isn’t any less important to society as his. This isn’t the first time he’s talked bad about my mother. He tried to downplay it to her so I messaged him a copy of the first part of the recording and send the whole thing to my mother since he wanted to try to lie. I’ve tried to be understanding and respectful but I’ve grown tired of his antics. We got into a fight over text because I was at work. I ultimately decided to block him. 

So I need to ask… AITAH?

Edit: I feel like I should add that I recently moved in around August to help my mother with the household. My father works out of town and my mother and I have day jobs. I have a middle school aged sister that is a handful. Isa cooks dinner for everyone. I help with chores and the animals (3 outside cats, 4 puppies, 3 adult dogs). I only moved back after my mother asked me to in January. I pay her $100 a week and she gets $150 from Isa. I also run errands and help shop for my mom. I had been moved out for 4 years and was very unsure about moving back but felt like my mom needed help. I live up the hill and not in the main house but I go down for food, bathroom, and to spend time with the family. ",0,1757853791.0,AITAH,2,0.33,False

My experience is being HYPER attentive to peoples expressions. I can notice the moment-to-moment changes in a persons attitude towards me. I can also very clearly read social cues and the mood of any room.

I think my mum was BPD or also HSP, as she would hyper-fixate on my facial expressions and any hint of negativity would be punished with hysteria. So I developed very very deep masking mechanisms and suppressed any hint of negativity. My default expression was a smile which I had to un-learn later because It was actually creeping people out. I'm 30 years old and I still basically exist behind layers of masking.

I remember in school I would be moved by certain things more than my peers, who I thought were emotionless and brute-ish. Back then I suppressed this, in fear of being judged.



I react very badly to all drugs except coffee. Doing uppers makes me borderline psychotic.

Growing up I felt very alienated from my peers so I developed deep resentment towards humanity. I avoid looking people in the face because 1. I don't want to see disapproval and 2. I automatically scowl at people. I literally do not feel any warmth towards anyone in my life, despite acting nice around everyone. I think people sense this coldness / defensiveness so they kinda feel there's something odd about me.

Being aware of how people perceive me is like getting stabbed in the chest moment by moment.

1ngq921,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1ngq921/anxiety_from_methylfolate_and_next_steps/,Anxiety from Methylfolate and next steps,"Advice welcome.

I had a genetic test done during my doctors investigation into drug resistant anxiety and fatigue. It showed CF677T but no COMT issues.

He told me to start taking Methylfolate - standard OTC dose. Which I did at 3000ug for two days.

Heightened anxiety and borderline panic followed almost immediately. 

I understand after reading these forums and elsewhere the impact the methylfolate likely had. A single dose of Niacin seemed to help for a few hours or so.

Two questions:

- Should I continue taking Niacin and for how long. Seems extreme to take it every few hours, but it does work. I don’t want to cause any sort of imbalance or overload however.

- I see conflicting information on whether to treat anxiety in people with this mutation (and who react as above to supination). (1) Some people say to push through whilst gradually increasing dose, endure the anxiety, and wait for the befits to come when the body has adjusted. (2) Some people say that the above reaction is a straight intolerance to methyl’s and to find another supplement with same action. In my case, any ideas which may be best?

Also, has anyone with a long term anxiety problem solved it with Methylfolate supplementation either as a mono therapy or 
As part of something else?
To note:

- Symptoms doc originally investigating (not the response to methylfolate) are anxiety, fatigue, brain fog. Also have adult acne as a male which has always baffled me and feels intolerance driven. Yet to find culprit.
- I have no COMT mutation
- Coffee and ADHD meds make me almost instantly tired.",2,1757853540.0,MTHFR,7,1.0,False

I can say that we both have a good 3-year relationship but it ended bad for good reason/s. I’m having unnecessary flashback/s the past few weeks and I can say that seeing things around me that reminds me of you made it worst. Do you still remember the excitement you made me feel when you said your favorite food was a pair of Jollibee’s Chickenjoy and JolliSpaghetti? I walked-in and ordered it last week. You introduced me to Ikea and now I can’t help but keep coming back almost every week/end. It’s been a while since I visited Bonifacio Global City just because I’m afraid that I would see you or with someone else, but yesterday, I braved going there because all I was thinking about was the closure that I wasn’t able to receive. I’m not saying that I was actually ready to see you, it’s been almost two years but I still don’t want to see you. It aches me that I can’t even say “I’m sorry” or “I miss you” but that’s all true. You know what, I’m doing well at work. I’m getting all the things that I wanted and I’m slowly being happy again, not because I rely on someone but because I rely on myself now. How about you? I’m sorry I was actually secretly stalking your socials from time-to-time and I know you maybe relying on some apps that monitor your secret visitors but I don’t give a fvck. I was secretly hoping that you still care for me, that one day may be you’ll try to exert any efforts to connect with me again. I’m not asking us to be friends or whatever but who knows? Yes, this, I know I’m not making any sense but you already know what I mean, right? “Kung iibig kang muli, sana mag-ingat, nang wala ng puso pang masasaktan” is the perfect line for me. I’m sorry I was not able to protect you from leaving. I’m sorry you had enough and got tired of me. I’m sorry I wasn’t doing enough to see you in my future, I know the last time you asked me what it would be for us 5 years from that day and all I said was “I don’t know” because I can’t really tell… It was my cowardice that got me to think that a commitment with you means correcting all the bad habits (that I would love to) but can’t do it in an instant, fear really made me think twice that day and surely gave you definitely a wrong answer, but if only I had the courage to say that “you’ll live with me, we’ll be under one roof, you get to do the things that you love and get earning because of it while I do the same, and it gets us to think that we achieved a lot already… we’ll love traveling together, you may love it alone thinking that someone’s waiting for you at home, cooks your breakfast, your lunch, your dinner, washes your clothes and irons them when you need it, picks the best gifts for Christmas, your birthday, writes the best anniversary love letters and still do it spontaneously, might give you flowers and allows you to do the same to me as you wish, cuddles with you each night and talks about a lot of things before we fall asleep, and sometimes laugh when you accidently/intentionally fart or burp or whatnot because we both know that it’s cute sometimes haha, make you coffee and remind you that drinking too much would trigger acidity, hugs you from behind and dance to a song that I would hum, probably walk our dog outside while we listen to our favorite podcast, visit you at your booths and fairs and congratulates you for a job well done, and so much more.

I work from home, so being in a suburb that’s safe, comfortable, and has a few nice spots (coffee shops, co-working spaces, etc.) where I can work from every now and then would be ideal.

1ngq0r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1ngq0r7/care_after_accident/,Care after accident,"I have been with my husband for 10 years (him: 38M, me 32F). We have a really happy, lovely relationship – very loving, and full of joy and fun.

I had a serious accident a few weeks ago. I got a mild traumatic brain injury (=severe concussion), fractured my nose, my cheekbone, and my eye socket, and came out with my face all cut up and swollen, my legs & body bruised and cut etc. It could have been a lot worse - the ER doctors told me I nearly lost my eye, could have had a much more severe brain injury etc. My request for advice is about how my husband was toward me after the accident.

Some context on our life first: Until the accident we've both been very physically active, independent people. We have engaged in open/ENM stuff together for most of our relationship (e.g. play parties, dating couples/individuals together), but only opened up to solo experiences or dating about a year ago. We didn’t have any other partners at the time of the accident. We also don’t have many close friends in our city at the moment – lots of new acquaintances, but I had no one else I could really rely on apart from him.

This was the timeline:

Tuesday morning: Accident. Spent 8h in ER (with husband); discharged home in the evening.

Thursday (2 days post accident): I was still very injured - could only lie in a dark room, sleeping and listening to audiobooks. We had both planned to go to a friend's party that evening. I said to my husband he should still go. He went.

Friday (3 days post accident): At some point this day, we had an argument and he told me he felt “trapped”. Context: He works from home, so had been home during the days since the accident working. He had gone out to the gym/supermarket etc, and had gone to the party on Thursday, but otherwise had been at home with me.

Saturday (4 days post accident): We had both been planning to go to a friend's party late that night (start c. 10pm). I was too unwell to go, but thought it would be ok for him to still go after I'd gone to sleep. He informed me after we woke up morning that he would go on a date that evening, before going to the party. This was a first date, with someone he’d met at a nightclub the weekend before. Our typical practice had been to give notice about scheduling dates and check in with each other about what would be good timing for the other person, so this was already out of our normal practice to just announce a date on the day. Moreover I was really upset considering I was in such a bad state still: because of the concussion I couldn't read, watch TV, go for walks, or do anything except snuggle, chat, or listen to audiobooks. I was also just feeling pretty ill because of the concussion – headaches, dizziness etc – and it wasn’t pleasant being alone. I was extremely upset that he would leave me alone in this state to go on a first date with someone he barely knew. He refused to change the date, saying he'd already changed it once (it had been scheduled for Wednesday, but he’d canceled because of the accident). I ended up crying and really begging and pleading with him to stay at home with me. Eventually he agreed. We had a super nice evening playing a board game, and then he went to the party when I went to bed.

Tuesday (7 days post accident): I was still off work for the week recovering, but starting to be able to do a few more things (e.g. could spend c. 1 hour per day reading or on the computer). Still was mostly just able to lie on the couch not doing much, and face was still swollen and bruised etc. Husband asked me if I would be ok with him going out that afternoon and evening: on a coffee date with the person he’d rescheduled on Saturday, then for dinner with a friend, then to a DJ meetup. I said I was ok with it (although, I didn’t really feel ok with it: I wrote in my journal, if it took me begging and crying a few days ago to ask him to spend time with me, and he couldn’t stand it that much that he wants to go out again a few days later, I have too much pride to beg again.) He didn’t text me until hours after the coffee date: it turns out that he’d had fun with the woman on the date, so had canceled the dinner with his friend and gone back to her place to have sex instead. This is not against our agreement – sex on a first date is “allowed” – but it wasn’t what I’d expected, given the plan he’d told me and given that I was really vulnerable and at home alone. I was really shocked and upset.

The final thing was that he was due to go away for two weeks starting on the Thursday (9 days post accident). My parents had been planning to come visit from another country the following Monday. But with the head injury and my ongoing bad concussion, I was not feeling well or able to be very independent, so it would not have been ideal for me to be on my own for four days. Husband said to me a few days after the accident: “Why don’t you ask your parents to come earlier so that you won’t be alone?”. I asked him, “Why don’t you change your flight to go later instead?”. He didn’t answer (and now says he didn’t hear me ask that). For context, his trip was a work trip, but the work commitments only started on the Monday, so he could have changed it quite easily: the Thursday-Sunday portion was booked so that he could spend the weekend getting a tattoo, going to a play party, and going to a rave with friends.

When he left for his trip, he hadn’t done any of the things that needed doing in the house – e.g. the car had the engine light on and he hadn’t taken it to the garage, the lawn was super long and needed to be cut (we get fines if it’s too long… sigh), he hadn’t taken out the trash or recycling. Since I couldn’t do it with the concussion my parents had to do it when they arrived.

The rest of the time, he was very sweet and loving and took care of me: bringing me things I needed etc.

At the time I was really sort of shell-shocked by his behavior and still very concussed, so couldn’t really process it. But as the weeks went on and I’ve started to recover, I’ve felt that this doesn’t at all reflect the man I thought I was married to. The rest of our relationship he’s been super loving and wonderful - though, I have never needed care before in that way. I've never during our ten years before questioned whether this was the right person for me.

But, if during only a nine-day period when I had a bad accident and nearly died, he feels “trapped” being at home (despite going out to two parties), and prioritizes first dates with strangers, play parties, tattoo appointments, and raves over looking after me, I have no idea what to expect during hard times in the future. In particular, we'd always planned to have kids some day, but I'm now scared: what would it look like if I’m pregnant or we have small babies? Would he feel trapped just having to spend time with me & kids at home? He tells me that two things explain his behavior – (1) he didn’t realize how badly injured I was and how much I needed him, and (2) he hasn’t ever had to take care of anyone before, so is just learning how to do it, and I need to help him learn and be patient, give him time.

I understand his points but… I still feel really scared about what this tells me about him. Is this normal behavior and I’m expecting too much to think he’d know how to care for me without me teaching him? Is he having some kind of crisis in response to my accident? Or is this just the first time that he’s really been “tested” (for most of our relationship, we’ve both been super independent, traveled a lot separately, etc), and it turns out he just would rather put his own desires for fun above being at home caring for his partner?

I would love any thoughts and advice.

It’s a regular morning for David, he just woke up and is about to get ready to go to work. As he is starting to open his eyes, his wife Sheela gives him a kiss on the forehead and the light of the rising sun shines into his bedroom. He starts to get ready for work as his wife scrolls through TikTok, he overhears the news fish from SpongeBob’s voice on his wife’s phone say “there has been a new ufo sighting outside of Tucson Arizona today, the government hasn’t released a statement yet, but there were multiple fighter jets seen flying around the object before it vanished. Follow for more!” After which David’s wife Sheela mutters to herself that she’s tired of seeing all these ufo sightings and hearing about coverups and is ready for them to just come out and say aliens are real. Little does she know, the rest of this week is going to change everything either of them ever knew. David finishes getting ready for work at the local hospital and Sheela is now in the livingroom laying on the couch watching Rich and Morti as David is about to head out. “Have a good day at work my love” “thank you baby, I hope you have an amazing day yourself, I’ll see you when I get home” David then gives Sheela a little hug and kiss before leaving. Making sure to lock the door before heading down to his car. On his way to work, he puts on the new deathwrites album on Spotify. Jamming out before another shift. Back at home, Sheela is scrolling tik tok while Rick and Morty plays on the living room tv, while scrolling she keeps seeing videos about the cia accidentally leaking up close ufo footage, she dismisses them as clickbait and turns her phone off to watch Rich and Morti since her favorite episode is on. Back at the hospital, David goes through shift huddle and starts getting report on his patients for the day,  he spends the day giving out pain meds and helping his patients use the bathroom, nothing out of the ordinary. After his 12 hour shift is done, he clocks out and heads home to his wife Sheela. Opening his apartment’s door he smells freshly made pork chops, and sees his wife sitting on the couch waiting for him to return. He walks up to her and gives her a solid kiss, embracing her as they do every time one of them comes home from work. “How was work?” “It was okay, nothing out of the usual, just tired” “well, thankfully your off tomorrow, so we could maybe go have a little dinner date” “okay bet, I’m down. By the way, whatever you made smells amazing, what is it?” “Fried pork chops and mashed potatoes, wanna grab a plate and head back to the room?” “I’m down, I’ll grab us some drinks you want cherry Dr Pepper or regular?” “Regular” Sheela gets up and makes two plates of food while David grabs a regular Dr Pepper and a cherry Dr Pepper from the fridge, they then both go to their bedroom, and put YouTube on and start eating. The night goes on like normal, they finish their meals and go to sleep awaiting a new day. 
          Sheela woke up before David today, as she’s slowly waking up, opening her eyes and rubbing those crusty bits from the sides of her eyes, she opens her phone and sees a notification, “government notice, the president will address the American people at 3pm standard time, do not be alarmed this is not an emergency, but is very important. Keep an eye out on all social media channels and all tv stations as it will be broadcast on every platform available” she dismisses it thinking the president is just going to spew some hate speech or try and declare martial law as a bid for power. She puts her phone down and kisses David on the forehead just like he did the morning before, and keeps kissing and hugging on him until he wakes up. Now awake, Sheela asks David if he wants to go get ihop, and David nods his head in aggreance. They then both get dressed, Sheela in a pair of sweatpants, a shirt, and some slides. And David throws on his favorite jeans, a jacket, and sneakers. On the way to ihop they notice the streets being eerily empty for this time of day, David remarks  “ what the hell? Where is everyone, it’s 8am on a Monday?” “I don’t know, prolly some random holiday we didn’t know about, or everyone is paranoid about the presidential address that’s happening today”  “what address? I didn’t see or hear anything about it” “pulling up her phone, I got a notification about it earlier when I woke up, it seemed serious. But you know how the president is” “yeah you got a point, if anything we’ll at least have the ihop to ourselves hopefully” as they pull into the ihop, they both hear a quiet mechanical humming, kind of like the engine of a car, but with less rhythm and far away as they get out of the car and start walking to the front door to the ihop, both David and Sheela ignore it, thinking it’s just some douche with a straight piped truck” after being seated and handed menus they order two coffees, two waters, and half and half creamer. While waiting to order food, they talk about where they want to travel next, David takes a sip of his coffee“ ya know, I heard Washington is pretty nice this time of year, perfect for us to go hiking” “I know, but what about Montana? It’s also pretty nice there, plus pretty good contracts for nurses” putting down his coffee, “I don’t know, maybe. We’ll see when this travel contract ends, don’t you have 4 weeks left? I know I have 3 left” “yeah, i only have 4 weeks left in this contract, well look around when its over” “sounds like a plan to me my love” the waiter comes by and takes their order. David and Sheela then keep talking about work and their plans for the future until they both finish their food and start to head back home. On the way back, David notices a streak of blue light cross the sky in front of them, reminding him of a fighter jet. “Hey babe, did you just see that?” “Yeah, must’ve been some new plane or something from the military base nearby, I’ve been seeing them for the past couple weeks” “well, hopefully this presidential address isn’t gonna be some notice of war or something” “I hope not, I don’t want you getting drafted” “neither do I, but we shall see” after getting home, they spend the rest of the day cleaning and watching shows together until 3pm, when both of their phones and all of their tvs switch to the same broadcast. There’s just the president standing at a podium, and he starts to speak. “My fellow Americans, I’m sure we can all agree I have been doing an amazing job at running the country, the absolute best, even the president of Russia said I was doing an amazing job, but today I will share with you amazing news, I have made some new friends, some of the friendliest people you could know, maybe the friendliest, who knows. But these new friends of mine would like to tell us all something and I think it’ll be amazing news, not fake news, but the realest news ever spoken on camera. Even my golfing buddies said they were the absolute best, anywho, here is my friend, from the galactic council, which might I add is an amazing council, grefed. The president steps away from the podium as a short blue man who doesn’t look exactly human thanks him and takes the stand. *hushed gasps are heard in the background “People of the United States, my name is grefed and I am here as part of a delegation sent by the galactic council of civilizations to welcome you all to the stars. I’m sure you are all very interested to hear what we want with your people, and I would like to say that we only wish to help you, and in saying that. We are peacefully offering every nation on this planet you call earth, the opportunity to join the galactic community as a single newly formed nation. The president of the nation you are currently in has already agreed to join us in our mission for peace and prosperity for all of your citizens. However, any nation that declines membership will be given 1 solar rotation to think it over as you would put it, before either joining peacefully, or other means. Either way earth is no longer separated by imaginary boarders. There is no need for such foolishness in the new age your society is about to experience. As first order of business, starting in one week, everyone will be required to take a test to determine what function you will have in society, there will also be a permanent freeze on all banking institutions, and there will be an immediate seizure of all personal firearms. In doing so, we hope to bring peace and prosperity to your world. Housing and nourishment will be provided for free to every being on this planet. Regardless of status before this change. The government you used to know will no longer be in charge, and we will be assuming said role due to gross negligence and incompetence we have observed over the past few solar cycles. I know this will be a very big change, but believe us when we say we are here to help. The broadcast then ends and the logo of the galactic council shows up in the center. Then goes to black. eyes wide and mouths open, David and Sheela are lost for words, David finally finds some semblance of words and can only say “wha, what the fuck? What the fuck? What? What the fuck was that!” “I have no fucking idea, what do we do now????” As soon as she finishes her sentence, a glowing orb appears in their living room, it shines in a deep yellow hue, and suddenly two pictures of hands pop on the orb with text above saying “place hands to verify identity” as David and Sheela are staring in disbelief at the orb, it start making noise. It sounds remotely like English, but garbled and in a strong English accent “Ello chaps, my name is Edward. Would you place ya mits on me here on the pictures so i can check ya?” David stares at Sheela and puts his hand on the orb his hand glowing green as if he passed some sort of check. Immediately the orb starts speaking again “so what have ya David? Where’s the missus? Can she touch me too or is she being daft?” David looks at Sheela standing a couple feet back, “so what are you Edward? What are you doing here? And David why’d you listen to it as if it had a gun to your head?” “I don’t know, it looked cool” the orb starts glowing orange now instead of yellow, “so whatcha gotta know about me is I’m a companion orb sent by the council to every one of yous humans to help get you acquainted with the new laws and such. I’m also here to answer any questions you may have about your new government or to just help out where I can, ya know I’m fitted to do all sorts of stuff, now I just need to verify I was sent to the right place, can you touch me Sheela?” As she inches closer and starts to place her hand on Edward, “so this is our life now huh?” As soon as her hand touches Edward, he starts glowing green for a few seconds, then dims down to a candle shade of yellow. “With all that out the way, let me introduce myself proper. My name is Edward as you already know, I’m a companion orb here to help you on your journey to galactic council membership. As part of the agreement you just signed with your mits, you now have access to my entire library of information on our council. If ya want I can even have a vessel sent down to bring you aboard the ss shitana so you can witness the grandeur that is the galactic council” David looks at Sheela with shock written all over, color drained from his body pale as a stone, then back at the orb “can we um have a few minutes alone Edward? I’d like to talk this out with my wife, “of course govena you can do anything you want as long as it ain’t conspiring against your new rulers, we don’t like that too much, anyway. Just say Edward I want you when you wanna talk some more” the orb then disappears in a cloud of static. David and Sheela are left there standing in their living room, shocked to their core.

First of all, for some godforsaken reason, they shout out loud the n-word making sure everybody around hears them, which would be bad enough by itself, if they didn't say it once EVERY FUCKING 3 WORDS. I swear they can't go a single minute without saying the n-word (they're all white caucasians ofc). Also some Mussolini joke here and there to spice it up (one of them I particularly despise is a self-proclaimed fascist, good thing I trusted my gut when I first met them and never told them I was gay). I don't get it, are they just trying to be edgy? They're 19-20 year olds, I got past that phase at 12.  
BUT while we were having lunch yesterday and came a guy to fix a hole in the wall (a hole that, of course, they made pushing the door against the concrete), no slur or ultranationalist lingo of sort was heard. If you gotta be racist assholes be brave enough to show it to people who aren't your roommates as well, you fucking pussies...  
  
Second, they're absolutely filfthy. Our dorm includes a daily cleaning service of rooms and facilities. They come deep cleaning every single day, and they STILL manage to make their side of the kitchen look like the subway. I'm talking about piles of dirty dishes (we have dishwashers, mind you), food left to rot outside (there once was a whole chicken left on the counter for an entire day), crumbles on the table or coffee spilled and never cleaned, etc... Of course, if you get close enough, you don't just see it but smell it too.

Finally, they're soooo loud. They scream and punch the table like fucking toddlers just because it's their idea of fun. Luckily my room is pretty far away from the shared areas so I don't really hear them. I'm trying to be as social as I can but this really looks unsalvageable.

From the morning coffee cup to the evening's food scraps, our lives are intertwined with the creation of waste. But where does it all go? And what impact does it have? The truth is, our garbage problem is a growing crisis, demanding urgent attention and proactive solutions.

### The Alarming State of Our Waste:

*   **Landfill Overload:** Landfills are rapidly filling up, becoming mountains of decaying matter. These sites release potent greenhouse gases like methane, which traps significantly more heat than carbon dioxide, accelerating climate change. Furthermore, leachate, a toxic liquid formed as waste decomposes, can contaminate groundwater and soil, posing serious environmental and health risks.
*   **The Plastic Plague:** Plastic waste is a particularly insidious problem. Millions of tons of plastic end up in our oceans annually, breaking down into microplastics that pollute marine ecosystems, harm wildlife, and even enter our food chain. The ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch,"" a swirling vortex of plastic debris in the Pacific Ocean, is a stark reminder of the scale of this crisis.
*   **Beyond Landfills: Incineration Concerns:** While incineration can reduce the volume of waste, it's not without its drawbacks. Incineration plants release air pollutants, including dioxins and furans, which can have detrimental effects on human health. The ash produced also needs to be disposed of, often in landfills.
*   **Global Disparities:** The burden of waste management often falls disproportionately on developing countries. Wealthier nations may export their waste to countries with less stringent environmental regulations, exacerbating pollution and health problems in those regions.

### The Three Pillars of Waste Reduction (and Beyond!):

We need a multi-faceted approach to tackle the garbage crisis. Here's how we can make a difference:

*   **Reduce: The Power of Prevention:** The most effective way to manage waste is to prevent it in the first place.
    *   *Conscious Consumption:* Before making a purchase, ask yourself: Do I really need this? Can I buy it used? Can I borrow it?
    *   *Minimize Packaging:* Choose products with minimal packaging or opt for reusable packaging options. Support companies committed to reducing their packaging footprint.
    *   *Embrace Digital Alternatives:* Opt for digital subscriptions, online banking, and paperless billing to reduce paper consumption.
*   **Reuse: Giving Items a Second Life:** Instead of discarding items, find creative ways to reuse them.
    *   *Repurpose Containers:* Glass jars, plastic containers, and cardboard boxes can be repurposed for storage, organization, or crafting projects.
    *   *Donate Unwanted Items:* Donate clothing, furniture, and household goods to charities or secondhand stores.
    *   *Repair, Don't Replace:* Extend the lifespan of your belongings by repairing them instead of automatically replacing them.
*   **Recycle: Closing the Loop:** Recycling is a crucial step in diverting waste from landfills and conserving resources.
    *   *Know Your Local Guidelines:* Familiarize yourself with your local recycling guidelines to ensure you're properly sorting your recyclables.
    *   *Clean and Sort:* Rinse food residue from containers and separate materials according to the instructions.
    *   *Support Recycled Products:* Choose products made from recycled materials to create demand for recycled content.
*   **Compost: Nature's Recycling System:** Composting is a natural process that transforms organic waste into nutrient-rich soil.
    *   *Backyard Composting:* Set up a compost bin in your backyard to compost food scraps, yard waste, and other organic materials.
    *   *Community Composting:* If you don't have space for a backyard compost bin, explore community composting programs in your area.
    *   *Worm Composting (Vermicomposting):* Consider vermicomposting, using worms to break down food scraps, for a compact and odorless composting solution.
*   **Rethink: Design for Circularity:** We need to move beyond individual actions and advocate for systemic change. This means supporting businesses and policies that prioritize circular economy principles, designing products for durability, repairability, and recyclability.  Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes, where manufacturers are responsible for the end-of-life management of their products, are a key part of this shift.

### Taking Action for a Cleaner Future:

The garbage crisis is a complex challenge, but it's one we can address through collective action. By making conscious choices in our daily lives, supporting sustainable businesses, and advocating for policy changes, we can reduce our waste footprint and create a healthier, more sustainable future for generations to come. Let's commit to burying less waste and building a circular economy where resources are valued and reused. Start small, stay informed, and inspire others to join the movement!

When they were at the pumpkin patch & we saw Anderson on the grass, he looked 5 months old to be very honest. He's ONE & extremely behind due to her!! The only days Anderson is home is Sat-Monday because Yar usually is home on weekends & Nancy is off on Monday so they take Anderson off Alex's hands so she doesn't have to do shit. Then Tues-Friday Anderson is in daycare. Let's just call it what it is, Alex cannot stand motherhood! She's lazy & gets highly irritated by Anderson over little shit. Him even being AWAKE triggers her & puts her ""on edge"" her own words from her previous vlog. So her solution is to force him to sleep & her talking about ""capping naps"" was her round about way of passive aggressively addressing it & basically her bitchy Alex coded way of  saying ""ok shut up now about it"" ",36,1757852201.0,alexandrarodriguez,20,0.97,False
1ngpsfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SahuSpace/comments/1ngpsfn/coffee_in_orbit_were_building_personal_spaceships/,Coffee in orbit? We’re building personal spaceships that make cafés look boring.,"I had the weirdest thought the other day while staring at my morning espresso.

Why do we still treat space like it’s this unreachable, holy thing when we’ve made everything else in life so casual? Cars. Planes. Phones. Even flying across the world became as normal as calling an Uber.

So here’s the crazy thing we’re working on:
personal spaceships that make “going out for coffee” as casual as hitting a café.

No, you’re not piloting it yourself like a sci-fi movie character — we handle the tech, the operations, the scary rocket science stuff. But imagine you and a friend saying: “Hey, want to grab a coffee in orbit?” and 90 minutes later, you’re literally sipping it while Earth curves below you.

Ridiculous? Maybe. But so was the idea of paying $6 for Starbucks 20 years ago. Now people do it daily without blinking.

We know this sounds elitist, controversial, and maybe even dystopian. Some will say, “This is a billionaire toy while the world suffers.” Others might say, “This is exactly how human culture evolves — from rare luxury to everyday reality.”

Here’s the real question:

👉 If personal space travel started as a luxury (like private jets or even coffee chains once did), would you still support it knowing it could eventually trickle down to everyone?
Or should space remain off-limits for casual human culture like this?",1,1757852180.0,SahuSpace,0,1.0,False

In the same coffee shop, same ounces of coffee, and the same coffee intensity. my the first time there, my iced macchiato was just around php120 and my second time there i ordered an iced americano that cost php140. I didn't remember their menu, I didn't also order sa cashier because I was checking their upper floors to see if I find it comfortable or not to study there (and it was) while their staff escorted me to the upper floor and took my order right there and then i took a seat not asking for the price of my order. After hours of studying, I paid for my ice americano and luckily I didn't ordered anything else because my only money was php200 cash (in their menu they didn't have anything less than 100php). 🥲😆

This is not a rant/criticism, I am just shocked. To the many cafes ive tried, my most ordered drink is an iced americano as it is not just the most affordable among other caffeinated drinks but i always like mine black. What do you think about iced americano more epxensive than other caffeinated iced drinks? I want to know more about coffee in terms of pricing and stuff :))

1ngpqx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ngpqx6/fines/,Fines,"The lone planet hung in space, approximately .8 krell from the puny yellow star. The Histariaz Battle cruiser had been sent by the leaders, as this ship would be more than enough to subdue such a fragmented planet. According to the Galactic records, first contact had been less than half a local rotation ago. No race in history had taken less than about 10 rotations to respond properly to the wider galaxy knocking on their door.

 

Powering up the main mass driver, the captain of the Histariaz Battle cruiser finished polishing his bejewelled nose guard and pressed the button to interrupt all communication on the planet below. He would deliver the ultimatum of surrender and servitude, or destruction an…  zzztttzzz “Ding! Unknown vessel, you are currently parked in a no parking zone. You have been fined 1,000 galactic credits and will be further fined per 5 local minutes you stay illegally parked.”

Captain Winzs looked at the bridge speaker system. “How did they get into our coms ?” Before his panicked communication officer could answer, another message came through “Bong! Unknown vessel, you have powered area effect weapons inside a no fire zone, you have been fined 22,000 galactic credits for this offence. Failure to power down weapons immediately will result in further fine being levied against your descendants or suitable planetary representatives. Your vessel is also being targeted by space and land-based defence systems.”

 

Captain Winzs turned to his weapon’s officer and snarled, “Target any weapons targeting us, prepare to destroy them!” Turning back to his communications officer, Winzs signalled for him to open the communications channel again. “This is Captain Win… ZZZssszzzxxx” The channel shut-down following a brief display of electrical components ascending to a higher level of existence. The communications officer jumped back from his burning console and tried to smother the flames with his ceremonial feathered headdress. (All Bridge crew were required to be in dress uniforms when making announcements to planets they were conquering, it improved the image.) “Captain, the sending circuits have melted, we cannot communicate.”

 

Just as Captain Winzs was about to respond, the untouched receiving circuits fritzed to life and a calm voice was heard on the bridge. “Unknown vessel, you have been fined an additional 2,000 galactic credits for failure to move to a designated parking orbit, as well as an additional 50,000 for continuing to power area effect weapons in a no fire zone. Furthermore, your attempt to mass broadcast to the planetary communication system has resulted in fines for contravening 13 Planetary, Federal and Galactic Council laws on the use of communication devices. Needless to say, the combined fines now exceed the value of your vessel, and it has been confiscated to act as surety for payment.

 

The navigator jumped up from his console. “Captain, someone has hacked our system and is remote piloting us towards the moon.” Captain Winzs looked on in panic as his weapon systems suddenly powered down, all the hatches on the ship closed, and then started opening in sequence. He was unsure what was going on, until he realised that areas were being linked together, and the crew were being forced to move to the new area, by the warning alarms announcing imminent atmospheric loss to space.  Compartment by compartment, all his crew were being herded towards the hanger bay. Only the bridge seemed safe. Checking to make sure, Winzs was shocked to discover the corridor outside the bridge was now in hard vacuum. There had been no warning sirens or anything.

 

After about an hour, the Histariaz Battle cruiser made Luna orbit.  Arrayed in front of them were a half dozen warships from local raiders to mid-range armed forces. Moving from captured ships to a ground base (in a rather large crater on the moon), were military transport shuttles based on the standard Galactic pattern. As the ship came to a stop, several transport shuttles docked with the hanger bay, which then slowly started to decompress. Encouraging the terrified crew towards the shuttles and air.

 

Captain Winzs slumped his shoulders in defeat and marshalled his crew towards the bridge airlock, where a shuttle had just docked. The slight hiss of escaping air made it obvious that the atmosphere on the bridge was being vented. The stunned communications officer went to put his still smoking feathered headdress back on, but the captain motioned for the crew to take them off. “We are not going to intimidate these Terrans with feathered headdresses, not after they captured our ship so easily.

 

Sitting in an office on Earth, the two members of the “Terran Cyber defence team” marked another silhouette on the wall chart.  Standing behind them was a visiting representative from the Galactic Federation. He had been doing a tour of the space control offices when the attack had started. Passrd was an expert in assisting newly discovered system to integrate into the Gal Fed. Sadly, he had seen too many fall to pirates such as the Histariaz group. Terra/Earth seemed to be different though, very different.

 

“How did you take control of that pirate ship so quickly?” Passrd had been shocked at the lack of panic on display and then shocked even more when he understood what the “Cyber” team was doing. “I do not understand how you even managed to think of such a desperate response.”

 

William Maize smiled as he turned to Representative Passrd. “It started when your Gal Fed pilot made contact with us about 6 months ago.  When he rescued that deep space racer with the damaged ship.” Pssrd remembered the incident, it had been a great way for the humans to discover they were not alone, and a surprise to the Gal Fed who thought nothing could be alive and sentient, on a class 4 death world. “When his ship was getting ready to land in Scotland, local space controllers contacted his ship to assign it an IFF and also check it was not likely to cause any problems. (dangerous animals etc.) When the technician made contact with the ship, the anti-virus software on his computer detected an un protected system and wanted to do a virus scan.”

 

Pssrd checked the readout on his wrist. “Yes, my ship had triggered a similar issue when it contacted the local air tower for permission to land.  It seems that the Space Command computers are very persistent in checking vessels, and it went through what we thought was adequate protections in seconds. “Yes”, said William, “The traffic control computers are designed to help land ships, especially in an emergency. They have the habit of being ready to do so at a moment’s notice.”

 

William smiled again at that, “Yes, and when we realised how unprotected Gal Fed Ship computer systems are, our section was set up to see what we needed to do in cases such as these. The idea for the fines was because our budget was not properly allocated, and we need the money for more comfy chairs. Mind you, with the Histariaz ship being docked at the alien transit station on the moon, the ship would soon be officially claimed as forfeit due to fines and then off to the ship yards for evaluation, then either modification for humans, or disassembly for parts.”

 

Pssrd smiled again, “And you have how many ships so far?”

David Blu, and William looked at the tally board on the wall. “8 ships so far this month. “6 of them in lunar orbit, and another 2 in the docks for evaluation. Along with the 15 ships in the previous few months, we have 23 different ships so far.”

 

Pssrd started to smile (A human trait he was learning), then his face froze. “Hold up, 23 different ships? Not ones from the same races? Do you mean to say you can take over any ship in range?”

William actually grinned at that, actually putting down his coffee mug to do so. “Watch this…” Seeing the image of his ship flash up on the main monitor, Pssrd was not expecting anything to happen. His ship was protected by the best computer system in the Gal Fed alian… Just then, the ships forward thrusters started to vent small puffs of gas. The microphones nearby heard the unmistakable sounds of a recent popular song. Somehow, they had reprogramed his ships variable aperture thrusters to emit passable sound effects.

 

Pssrd watched as the song finished with a flourish of gases. “Please tell me that is the only access you have, that is a diplomatic ship and the crew must be worried something is going wrong.” William looked at another monitor, it showed the entire crew in the galley had been too busy watching a collection of videos showing various baby earth animals rolling off couches etc., they had missed the entire show. “We also gave your crew full access to the local pay TV and ISP channels so they would not be bored. “

 

At this point, Pssrd was convinced that these humans would be an interesting race to help guide as they joined the Galactic Federation… He just hoped the Gal Fed could survive the experience.

@ sibylymia

*Low visibility cloaks are handy until you need to get someone's attention.*

Lee tapped an impatient finger on the counter, reminding the reptilian innkeeper she was waiting. The wide handed proprietor leaned against two large crates and a dolly stood empty beside a white or was it blonde-furred courier he was chatting up. The delivery man with a very human face smiled wide. Those amber eyes glued to the unsigned paperwork waving carelessly in his captor's scaly claws. Neither male paused their banter to acknowledge her entrance from the street or the polite cloud of dust that clamored in the air beside her at the bar. She wondered if something inside of it was alive– the gorge was a strange place. 

""There's no magic in the gorge– but *everything* is alive."" The last anxiety-soaked words of well-meaning advice her packmate, Liddy, had imparted before they themselves parted ways at the southern cliff; before Lee descended the low clouds alone on that overcast day seasons past.

Liddy's claws dug into Lee, a final embrace, raising red welts on her back and arms. Lee tried not to think of how her companion's fur and padded claws reminded her of a certain cuddly canine from home. While Ms. Lydia's stature reminded Lee of American actress Allison Janney in the youth of her career, her friend was a tall and slender dog-headed female whose markings and long snout resembled a coffee coded German shepherd. Lee would never say this part out loud again, but her friend looked a bit like a coyote too. Blonde ears with java-colored tips stayed pinned apologetically. Liddy nuzzled into Lee's neck and cheek– covering her scent she realized. Her human scent.

Well, that's not right. Lee wasn't human anymore. Her smell was of something else. No one could give her a straight answer. Oh, the icy chill of that notion-- that she was some*thing*. The memory of Liddy's short and soft facial fur warmed her already flushed cheeks.

Lydia, this proud female had been so meek when she whispered, as low as Lee had ever heard her. ""I will not go back there."" A promise.

She whispered to Lee, ""Be careful."" Because being safe was impossible. In the same shaky breath, she handed Lee a one dial radio phone, in case of emergency, but begged her not to call while she was still in the gorge. For the sake of the pleading in her friend's eyes, Lee wouldn't– not even if she lost a life for it. She was on her own in the gorge– in Asonia. Lee had endured three seasons in the songless wasteland and had run with the river that all but divides the continent. She could weather a balmy fourth.

Lee's leather-bound hand found the place where Liddy gripped her arm before letting her go. Lee attempted a squeeze there as voices returned to the room. ""Oh, no, no. I have deliveries."" The courier held up his hands and shrugged, politely declining another advance.

She felt nothing through the thick strips of cloth twining around her limbs and torso. The supplies strapped at all angles beneath her cloak were bulky. She had likely squished some sleeve bread in the moment to ground herself. The dust from her greyish green cloak finally settled in a neat pile on the chair beside her.

The heavy cloth was discreetly mended in several places. *It may not be pretty,* Lee thought. *But there's still some magic left.*

**The rest Chapter 1 | LEE is incoming. Thanks for reading and thank you for your patience.**

1ngpqlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundationTV/comments/1ngpqlh/gaals_visions_of_the_mule_and_why_its_really_not/,Gaal's visions of the Mule (and why it's really not that deep),"i've seen a lot of talk about how the visions don't make sense, why would she see the pirate and not bayta if her powers are so great and blah blah blah. the thing is, i don't think most people are considering her visions as a whole while trying to solve it. 

gaal's visions see a probably future without intervention. as in, they show where she's headed based on her last actions. she saw herself on synnax bring swallowed by a giant wave, since she was a child, because that was her future if she stayed. her whole village was covered by the rising seas, so you know her vision was true. what changed was that she left, and consequently survived.

her visions change based on the actions she takes to change them, and she learns that with salvor's death.

she had her visions of the mule, on a fight at tractor's library, while he searched for the second foundation, and salvor was dead on the battlefield. it showed her that: she would live til there, so would salvor (until she died there), that there would be a second foundation, and that the library would be important somehow. 

she put into motion the creation of the second foundation, check. and then salvor died. and the visions change to accommodate that, which means that she can too take actions that contradict the visions. that's what she meant by taking the fight to her own grounds, and her own terms. if she hadn't interfered, their collision course would be at the library, after they moved from ignis and received refuge given by demerzel. bayta wouldn't have been discovered, and kept the pirate as a front until there. he would still be the one physically fighting gaal in the library, hence her visions.

that's now changed, because gaal accelerated the events, the pirate is dead and bayta is in the open. and none of this contradicts the logic of the visions. and now I'm gonna make my morning coffee 🫶",12,1757852018.0,FoundationTV,8,0.93,False

A week later, HR discussed the key points of the contract with me over the phone, then followed up with an email summarizing everything and inviting me to the office for lunch or coffee.

1ngpon3,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ngpon3/any_other_genderfluid_people_uncomfortable_with/,Any other genderfluid people uncomfortable with the idea of dating someone who's only interested in one gender?,"I'm pan and bigenderfluid (he/she only) and after my previous relationship I find myself uncomfortable with the idea of dating someone who's only interested in one gender. My ex dumped me because he found out he was gay, which was honestly very dysphoria inducing for me, it didn't help that later I found out he still wasn't over the ex he dated before me, which confirmed my many suspicions.

I will clarify that I have no negative feelings towards people who are only attracted to one gender, but as someone who isn't one gender all the time it just doesn't feel right to date someone like that.

Everyone I know already thinks of me as a woman, even when I state my prounons and gender it's the problem of ""I use blank/blank"" ""Okay!"" (Only ever uses blank) simply because I don't currently have the freedom to express my gender the way I want to, for example, one time, a few years back, I cut my hair and everyone in my entire family complained about how much they loved my hair before, how I wasn't as pretty anymore, so on and so forth, I loved the way it looked, but when I did it everyone started hammering down on my assigned sex at birth, like they were scared I wanted to differ from it and I was constantly reminded, sometimes it was fine and other times I just couldn't take it anymore and would just shut off, having a mental breakdown in my head while I distanced myself from people.

When I felt dysphoric I would fantasize about giving myself some sort of makeover to pass as a guy, go by a different name, and meet my friends in person as a different person to see how they'd react to me without telling them it was me. I wanted to go for a walk in the park with my masc voice, wearing a wig, a binder, packed pants, and just drink coffee and watch the life of the city just exist while I ate my croissant and waited for a friend to meet me at the park, and nothing else in the world would make me feel more content. I'd wear a scarf, boots, and a nice jacket and just exist as me, but I can't do that, not while I don't live on my own, but maybe someday.

I was in love with a lesbian once, she was a close friend of mine who is unfortunately no longer with us. She didn't like me back, and I was upset and got over it, of course, but as the months past by and my gender shifted again, I started to wonder if the reason was in any way partly because she didn't see me as a woman, and despite everything that was going on in my life at the time the thought of it made me feel happier.

Something similar happened when I had a crush on a straight guy who was also a close friend of mine before he turned out to be a psychopath, he didn't really say why he didn't like me like that, and to be fair you can't always place why you just don't see someone romantically because it's not something you can really control, but when my gender shifted again I started to feel, somewhere in the back of my mind, a little hopeful that part of it was because he didn't see me as a woman.

  
This year I was in a meeting, we were all giving the option to introduce ourselves but it was only me and someone else in the class that did. I gave my name and pronouns and people smiled, they smiled at me the whole day, some of them I knew were trans because I had met them previously, but most of them I didn't know it all. I think it was the first time I ever felt truly seen when I mentioned that part of myself, usually they just ignore it but everyone in that room looked up and me from what they were doing and acknowledged it, either with neutrality or happiness.

It wasn't like all the times I came out to my family where they just rolled their eyes or got confused, it wasn't like when I mentioned to some of my friends that I was genderfluid and they supported, but only one of them really got it. And even then they didn't make eye contact with me when I said it.

  
Everyone is allowed to have whatever preferences they have, I'm not asking anyone to change, but when I date someone who I know is only interested in one gender and I just don't feel like that gender at all for a while, it's like knowing the only reason they find me attractive is because they still view me in that way, and if they didn't then they wouldn't find me attractive which is also a problem, so, I'll probably just only stick to dating people who are confident that they are attracted to both my genders. It took a while to finally accept this part of me, even longer to admit it out loud freely to pretty much everyone, and if I want to fully come to terms with my gender I'm going to have to start accommodating it more.",4,1757851849.0,lgbt,1,0.83,False
