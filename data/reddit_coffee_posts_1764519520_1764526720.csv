This doesn’t happen with my green mountain or Starbucks k-cups and my Keurig is brand new, so it’s not a clogged needle like Google suggests.  
I held one of the k-cups up to the light, along with the other brands, and there seems to be the same amount of grounds in the cup. I’ve wasted half the box of k-cups trying to figure this out and it happens every single time. 

I ordered these from the Keurig website along with a few other boxes of k-cups and it’s didn’t say anywhere that these produce less coffee and only work for a half cup of coffee (even the box says it can do 8oz!).

We’ve been dating for about 3 weeks and I haven’t been able to find anything wrong with him yet (lol) - he’s actually quite perfect and does everything he should, he communicates, he makes me sit next to him and talk when I’m upset till we work it out (wtffffff) and knows all of the right things to say and when to say them. 
I never come out and say I have bpd, because I find that if people aren’t familiar, then it just scares them - but he does know (from me sharing and also being with me enough) that I have anxiety, depression, ocd, emotional disregulation, abandonment issues, etc. he’s witnessed twoish episodes now where I’ve split and spiral over little things, that feel huge in the moment, but once I get out of emotion mind, I realize they’re small.
Anyway, he’s almost made it clear that he’s not afraid of me and he’s not going anywhere, but I continue to seek ways to push him away constantly. Probably because I feel he’s too good for me, that he will leave at some point, that I already embarrassed myself, etc.

My husband (37M) is a good man in many ways. He works long hours and is definitely the “provider” type. Bills are paid on time, we live comfortably, and he’s responsible. I’m grateful for that.

But emotionally and romantically… I feel invisible.

When we were dating, he used to be sweet- small gifts, surprise coffees, random late-night drives. Nothing extravagant, but thoughtful. After marriage, it’s like that part of him shut off completely.

He never plans dates.  
He never surprises me with anything.  
He doesn’t compliment me unless I ask if I look okay.  
He buys me gifts only on birthdays or anniversaries, and even then it’s something practical like a kitchen appliance.

I’ve tried telling him I want to feel special, not in a “buy me luxury handbags” way, but in a “put effort into romance sometimes” way. He always responds the same:

>

It hurt, because that’s not what I mean at all. I don’t want him to drown me in money, I just want to feel… cherished. I want to feel like his wife, not his roommate.

Last week things got heated. I told him I felt like he treats me more like a dependent than a partner. He got offended and said I’m ungrateful and living in a fantasy world. He insists “princess treatment” is for teenagers and that adult relationships are about responsibilities.

Now he’s barely speaking to me unless it’s about bills or chores.

My sister says I should be thankful to have a stable, responsible husband in this economy. My best friend says a woman deserves romance and emotional effort no matter how “practical” her husband is.

***What are the absolute requirements for developing a relationship with someone new?***



When shifting from maintaining a deep relationship to **starting a new one**, the requirements change. You don't need deep vulnerability or years of trust yet; you need the ""ignition"" elements.

If you strip away the romance and complexity, these are the **five absolute requirements** needed to get a new relationship off the ground.



# 1. Proximity and Frequency (The ""Mere Exposure"" Effect)



You cannot form a relationship with a ghost. Psychological research confirms that familiarity breeds comfort.^(1)



* **The Requirement:** You must have a way to interact repeatedly.
* **Why it matters:** A single interaction is rarely enough to cement a bond. Whether it is sharing an office, going to the same gym, or consistent digital communication, you need a recurring ""collision point"" where your paths cross.



# 2. Demonstrated Availability



Being physically present isn't enough if you are emotionally walled off.

* **The Requirement:** You must signal that you are open to connection.
* **Signals:** Putting down the phone, making eye contact, removing headphones, or having open body language.
* **The ""Space"" Factor:** If your life is 100% full (of work, stress, or other people), there is no vacuum for a new person to fill. You must create space in your schedule and mind.



# 3. Curiosity (The Spark)



You don't need immediate ""chemistry,"" but you do need curiosity.

* **The Requirement:** A genuine desire to know something about the other person that you do not already know.
* **The Shift:** This moves the dynamic from *transactional* (asking for the time, buying coffee) to *relational* (asking for an opinion, sharing a joke).
* **The Tool:** Asking open-ended questions.^(2) ""How was your weekend?"" is polite; ""What was the best part of your weekend?"" is curious.



# 4. Reciprocity (The ""Tennis Match"")



A relationship is, by definition, bidirectional. If you are doing all the work, it is not a relationship; it is a project.

* **The Requirement:** The other person must hit the ball back.
* **The Test:** If you initiate a text, do they reply? If you ask a question, do they ask one back? If you lean in, do they lean away or stay put?
* **Note:** In the early stages, the effort doesn't need to be 50/50 every single day, but the *intent* to engage must be mutual.



# 5. Basic Safety and Manners



Before anyone cares if you are funny, smart, or deep, they need to know you are safe.

* **The Requirement:** Adherence to social norms and boundaries.
* **The ""Creep"" Factor:** Pushing for intimacy too fast, ignoring physical space, or oversharing personal trauma on the first meeting violates this requirement.
* **Predictability:** In the beginning, being slightly predictable (polite, on time, calm) creates the safety needed for the other person to lower their guard.



# Comparison: Requirements vs. Accelerators



It is important to distinguish between what you *must* have and what just speeds things up.

||

|**Absolute Requirements (The Engine)**|**Accelerators (The Turbo Boost)**|
|**Contact/Interaction**|**Chemistry/Attraction**|
|**Reciprocity**|**Shared Hobbies**|
|**Respect/Safety**|**Similar Sense of Humor**|
|**Curiosity**|**Mutual Friends**|

# A Practical Check



If you are struggling to connect with someone new, check the ""circuitry"" against this list:

1. **Am I seeing them enough?** (Frequency)
2. **Do I look approachable?** (Availability)
3. **Am I asking questions?** (Curiosity)
4. **Are they asking me questions back?** (Reciprocity)",1,1764526431.0,DatingOverSixty,0,1.0,False

1pap562,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkLikeAnAdult/comments/1pap562/you_dont_need_to_be_hot_you_need_this_charisma/,"You don’t need to be hot, you need this charisma hack that’s backed by science","Ever notice how some people walk into a room and instantly draw everyone in? They’re not the best-looking, the richest, or even the most talkative. But somehow, they radiate that invisible pull. Meanwhile, others, even with a “perfect” face, get totally ignored. 

This pattern comes up over and over again in classrooms, workplaces, dates, and social circles. And here’s the kicker: most people think charisma is something you're either born with or not. Instagram coaches turn it into a weird cocktail of eye contact tips, confidence poses, and fake deep-sounding affirmations. TikTok is worse, flooded with “sigma male energy” edits and advice like “just don't care” or “be mysterious.” 

Problem is, that doesn’t actually teach you anything useful. 

So I did some digging. Read the books. Listened to the top psychology podcasts. Went through research papers, behavioral science studies, and social dynamics breakdowns. The result? A real, practical charisma framework that's learn able, no genetic lottery needed. 

If you’ve ever felt invisible, boring, or overlooked, there’s nothing wrong with you. The truth is, most of us were never taught how to be *interesting* in a way that feels genuine and magnetic. The good news? You don’t need to be hot. You need to learn *presence calibration*. Here's what the pros don’t tell you:

* **Charisma = Warmth + Presence + Power.**  
  This formula comes from Olivia Fox Cabane's book *The Charisma Myth*, where she lays out charisma as a trainable trait.  
  * *Warmth* means people feel safe around you.  
  * *Presence* means you're mentally *with* them in the moment.  
  * *Power* means you have confidence or status (not arrogance, just *certainty* in your vibe).  
  When all 3 align, people radiate toward you. When one is missing, something feels off.

* **“Being interesting” is less about talking, more about *reacting*.**  
  Harvard psychologist Dr. Amy Cuddy explains in her TED Talk and book *Presence* that people remember how engaged you made *them* feel. Not how much you said.  
  * Use *active listening* signals like micro-nodding, “hmm” sounds, leaning slightly in, and matching their energy.  
  * Ask *emotional follow-up* questions. Not just “Where did you travel?” but “What did you love about that place?”  
  * Avoid hijacking the convo with your own story unless they ask. Instead, validate what they said in a way that gives space.

* **Mirror neurons make charisma contagious.**  
  Neuroscientific research out of UCLA shows that when we observe someone’s expressions, tone, or gestures, our brain mirrors those states, it’s automatic.  
  * If you show genuine curiosity, others feel it.  
  * If you act distracted or indifferent, they shut down.  
  * If you carry tension in your shoulders or fidget too much, others feel anxious, even if you say nice words.  
  Bottom line: Your emotional state gets *downloaded* into the room. Calm, curious, kind beats loud, flashy, and reactive every time.  

* **Confidence is a byproduct, not a requirement.**  
  You don’t need to feel confident in everything. You just need to shift into *social flow*.  
  * According to Dr. Andrew Huberman from the Huberman Lab podcast, entering flow requires three things: moderate risk, full attention, and feedback.  
  * In social terms, this means: low-pressure stakes (small talk), total focus on the person (no phone), and visible reactions (their laughter, nods, surprise).  
  You don’t “fake it.” You *create* confidence by stacking small wins, a smile returned, a joke that landed, a connection made.

* **“Be mysterious” is overrated, clarity is sexier.**  
  A meta-analysis by the University of Toronto found that people rated clear communicators as more attractive and trustworthy than aloof ones.  
  * Instead of acting mysterious, talk *clearly and with intention*. Not too fast. Not too rehearsed.  
  * Share how you feel about things. Not what they want to hear.  
  * Be someone who *knows what they like*, that creates identity anchoring, which reads as confidence.  
  Want a charisma upgrade? Be someone with a clear take, even on little things like your favorite coffee or underrated movies. People love people with taste.

* **Vocal tone is 10x more important than the words you say.**  
  According to research from Dr. Albert Mehrabian at UCLA, in emotionally charged conversations, *tone* accounts for 38% of message impact. Actual words? Only 7%.  
  * Speak from your chest, not your throat.  
  * End sentences with a “falling” tone, signals calm authority.  
  * Pause more. Silence signals confidence.  
  Don't rush. People who control the pace of a conversation tend to be perceived as more dominant, in a good way.

* **Charisma can be practiced like a *skill*, not a vibe.**  
  From the book *Compelling People* by John Neffinger and Matthew Kohut (used in Harvard’s public speaking training), the key is to balance “strength” and “warmth” in every interaction.  
  * If you're too warm, you become forgettable.  
  * If you're too strong, you feel intimidating.  
  * To calibrate: match the intensity of the moment. Friend venting? Lower power, higher warmth. Presenting at work? Dial up strength with stillness and calm tone. Flirting? Tease gently, not aggressively.

* **One weird trick: Practice *presence reps*.**  
  Instead of practicing conversations, practice *attention control*.  
  * At the coffee shop, put your phone away. Make eye contact with the barista. Say their name.  
  * In Ubers, ask one thoughtful question about their playlist or day.  
  * On calls, listen fully before typing your response.  
  The more you train presence, the easier charisma becomes. It’s less about *social skills* and more about *social fitness*.

Charisma is not about being the loudest or the hottest. It’s about making people feel seen, heard, and drawn in, without trying too hard. And anyone can learn it. You just need the right settings, the right reps, and the right mindset.

I’m after something real. Shared values, actual trust, long-term goals. Not into games, flings, or modern dating nonsense.

\*\*About Me:\*\* Music’s a big part of my life. I mostly listen to extreme metal, black and death metal stuff. Cradle of Filth is my favorite band, with Belphegor and Burzum right behind. I do vocals for fun and used to play with some guys (I have hit the drum set a couple times). Emperor's song With Strength I Burn probably has my favorite lyrics. You don’t have to love the music, but you’ll need to be okay with the sound, the shirts, and the wall art.

I work in IT, handling help desk support for the rest of the staff, and I’m starting to get into software security. I know tech pretty well but I don’t like to live online. I’ll scroll sometimes, but I’d rather be talking or watching something together than just sitting on our phones.

Been gaming since I was a kid. I’m into Dark Souls, Resident Evil, Timesplitters, and old Tony Hawk. Still down for Kirby or Mario Party with friends. I like board games that actually require some thought, like Betrayal at House on the Hill or HeroQuest. Other stuff I’m into: classic horror, building Gunpla kits, museums, occasional camping, and I’ve been slowly learning Japanese. I don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, or even bother with caffeine usually, not in a judgy way if you drink coffee (but in a judgy way of you smoke).

\*\*What I’m Like:\*\* Introverted at first but social once I’m comfortable. My humor’s usually dry, dark, or a little weird. People say I’m easy to talk to and usually pretty funny in person. I have a strong filter for quality, whether it’s people, ideas, or anything else in life. I don’t fake things and can come off as negative sometimes but that just amplifies the stuff I do like as genuine and not slop. I take relationships seriously. I’m not afraid of commitment, I just want it to be with the right person, someone I can actually build a life with. I’ll take care of the people I love. I’m reliable, loyal, and when I’m with someone, I’m all in.

\*\*What I’m Looking For:\*\* I want a serious relationship with someone who shares traditional values. Long-term, I want a dynamic where I provide and my partner takes care of the home and raises a family. If that sounds boring or outdated to you, we’re probably not a match. I’m looking for someone younger, ideally between 18 and 24, since I want a big family and the timeline matters. I’m most attracted to East Asian or white women with a slim or average build, obviously personality is king but we can’t deny that physical attraction matters. As such I’ve attached pics of me for you to judge.

\*\*Dealbreakers:\*\* tattoos, far-left politics, weed or drug use, heavy drinking, or being chronically online. If you’re into gaming, metal, horror, or nerd stuff, we’ll probably get along.

Is that true?,"I was at my frat’s 95th alumni kegger and a brother from another chapter brings over his wife because she wants to talk about the Danish Deception scam from TikTok. 

I apologize and tell her, in my full country ass Texas accent, that it is my American duty to despise all members of royal blood on principle, so I can’t help her understand why that girl was so willing to be scammed by that man. She laughed and said that the Danish royal family is nothing like the British royal family, and tells me how friendly and personable the Danish queen and König are. 

She told me that it’s pretty common for Danish citizens to see the royal family out in public while you’re living your daily lives, and how they’re so nice that they would have a conversation with you if you met them in a coffee shop. Then she flips her phone around and shows me a pic of her parents standing next to your queen and king (they matched the pics on google) at a black tie event <— 🤯😱

Y’all is she just really rich (which is why her parents got to meet them), is she lying, or would they really speak to you if you were standing in line at together at Starbies?

## 🔍 What We’re All About

Look, the crypto market can feel like a casino if you’re flying blind. But when you know where the whales are moving their money? That changes everything.

Here’s what we focus on:

**Daily whale tracking** – We break down massive ETH, BTC, USDT, SOL, XRP movements in plain English. What happened, why it matters, and what it might mean for the market.

**Smart money alerts** – Exchange deposits, treasury transfers, token burns, stablecoin flows. If it’s significant, we’re watching it.

**Market context** – Not just *what* happened, but the story behind it. We connect the dots so you don’t have to guess.

**Learning together** – Nobody here was born knowing this stuff. Questions are encouraged. Discussions are healthy. We all started somewhere.

-----

## 💬 What You Can Share

This is your space too. Post anything that helps the community:

- Whale alerts you caught
- Charts or patterns you noticed
- Questions about on-chain data
- News that actually matters
- Tools or dashboards you use
- Your own analysis or theories

If it adds value, it belongs here.

## 🧭 The Vibe We Keep

We’re building something different here.

**No pump groups.** No spam. No “trust me bro” predictions.

I went on a mission to find a cashmere wool blend in the perfect chocolate slightly purple shade. I thought I found my match with Purl Soho Cashmere Merino Bloom in their new color Black Coffee. It’s 75% Extra Fine Merino, 25% Cashmere: Light Worsted/DK-Weight Yarn. I picked [Crew Sweater Oversize by Strikkeopskrift](https://spektakelstrik.myshopify.com/products/crew-sweater-oversize-strikkeopskrift).

I’m nearly done with the sweater (one sleeve left) and I think I’m going to love the sweater but it’s a little different than my inspo making me want to keep hunting for my perfect yarn.

What I love about the yarn: it’s soft and a nice rich brown. A lot of yarns don’t have a rich color.

Where Purl Soho’s cashmere merino bloom is falling short for me:

1. The fabric: It has a halo I wasn’t expecting. I’m not opposed to a halo on principle but it does make the sweater more casual and the inspo look is more polished.
2. The color: In bright light, there are strong green undertones which makes this more earthy than the inspo.
3. The knit: something about how this yarn is woven / twisted makes it very challenging to count my rows which I’ve never experienced.  I think this makes for a different visual texture that is fun but was challenging at times to double check my row stitch counter.

The Question: Any pointers to cashmere or cashmere wool blends that don’t have a halo but still have rich colors? I love the polished look but soft feel of some RTW sweaters like the Reiss one ([or this Nili Lotan one](https://www.nililotan.com/products/donnika-sweater)).

1paom52,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1paom52/afterlife_death/,Afterlife Death,"“This can’t be right,” I said, my eyes glued to my iMac, my coffee-lifting arm frozen midair. I was in the study, wherein I’d spent the better part of a month scrutinizing job listings, afore a desktop buried under bite-sized candy bar wrappers.

 

“What can’t be right?” asked my wife, Beatrice, from just over my shoulder. Since my layoff, her pretty face had sprouted three new wrinkles—deep ones—and her incessant nagging was the only thing keeping me from the couch, from watching ESPN until my eyes bled. Her job as a telecom sales rep barely covered her wardrobe requirements, after all, and our savings would only stretch so far before we lost the house. 

 

“This listing. No way can it be legitimate.”

 

“What’s it say?”

 

I swiveled in my seat, to stare into those chestnut-colored eyes of hers. It seemed that she’d been crying. Anxiously, she finger-scrunched her black bob cut. 

 

“It says that the research and development division of some company—Investutech, I guess it’s called—will pay $10,000 to anyone who lets the company claim their body after death.”

 

“So they pay you now, even though it might take you decades to die?”

 

“It appears so.”

 

Softly laughing, she shook her skeptical head. “Yeah, that’s *gotta be* a scam. But then again, it can’t hurt to call the number.”

 

“You’re serious? You want me to call these guys?” 

 

Before I could blink, Beatrice had the phone in my hand.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Investutech’s R&D facility epitomized modern architecture: a massive cube of steel and glass, unadorned and soulless. In its lobby, I met Dr. Vern Landon, Lab Supervisor. A short, bald fellow disappearing into his own liver spots, the good doctor shook my hand as if attempting to crush a spider between our palms.

 

“Thanks for coming down,” he said. “I know we’re somewhat off the beaten path, but that’s how corporate prefers it.”

 

“It’s no problem.”

 

“You’re here about the Internet listing, I understand.”

 

“Yeah…it’s some kind of scam, right?”

 

“Quite the opposite, my friend. At this establishment, we seek nothing less than world-shattering scientific innovation. In this pursuit, we use every tool obtainable, even the dead ones. To those of a scientific bent, a fresh corpse offers a cornucopia of potential knowledge.”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Some experiments are too risky to use a living human as a test subject, and lab monkeys don’t always cut the mustard. Perhaps you’d like an example. Well, when developing a medical device, we can insert it into a deceased man or woman to ensure that everything fits where it’s supposed to. We also harvest organs for tissue engineering projects.”

 

“Tissue engineering?”

 

“Yeah, buddy. Right now, we’re learning to create artificial and bioartificial organs for patients awaiting transplants. We also use cadavers in all sorts of genetic engineering projects.”  

 

Gently gripping my arm, Dr. Landon herded me down the corridor. “Come along now,” he said. “I’ll give you the grand tour.”

 

We passed a cafeteria, wherein a handful of sad-faced individuals in lab coats sat at Formica tables, silently consuming their lunches. As we walked, my guide began orating:

 

“Investutech is the number one innovator in a wide range of fields—from mainstream consumer technology to the wildest of fringe sciences. In fact, there are facilities like this spread all across the United States, answerable only to Investutech’s board of directors. At this location alone, we have laboratories dedicated not only to biomedical engineering, but also to physics, biology, and even psychology. We are engaged in many exciting projects here, which I’m unfortunately unable to speak of. Here’s the elevator. Why don’t we hop aboard?”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

While I didn’t get the whole run of the facility, I saw enough to be suitably impressed. Many doors were closed to us, requiring security clearance denied to visitors. I did, however, get to see a particle accelerator, located in an extensive, circular tunnel beneath the facility. The device’s beam pipe resembled something from a sci-fi flick, as if light cycle races could take place inside it. Naturally, I requested to see the thing in action—propelling particles at nearly the speed of light—but the doctor assured me it wasn’t possible.

 

The labs I visited were practically identical: workbenches and cabinets, sinks and tables, notebooks filled with incomprehensible jottings. In some corners, I saw containers marked with radioactive waste tags. 

 

In one laboratory, I was introduced to the jubilant Dr. Hegseth. Rotund and mottled, the man handed me a pill bottle labeled *6/7.9*. 

 

“What’s this?” I asked.

 

“Have you ever gone to the movies after getting good and smashed at the nearest bar?” 

 

“Why, yes, I suppose I have.”

 

“It’s great, isn’t it? In fact, the practice has gotten me through many an evening with the missus. The only drawback is the inevitable bathroom break, during which you could be missing the movie’s best scenes.”

 

“Yeah…what’s your point?”

 

“Well, each of those pills affects your system like a six-pack of strong beer. You can get as drunk as you like and never have to pee once. Pop a pill or two and you’re ready to sit through even the most insipid romantic comedy. Best of all, you won’t be burning off your date’s eyelashes with a blast of dragon breath.”

 

Thinking it over, I had to admit that the innovation intrigued me. 

 

“Keep the bottle,” Dr. Hegseth said. “They hit the market next month.”

 

Dr. Landon led me further down the corridor. Passing a number of simulation-running supercomputers, we arrived at the psychologists’ labs: austere rooms featuring one-way mirrors and hidden cameras, allowing one to observe the behavior of human test subjects. Only one room was occupied. Imagine my surprise when Dr. Landon whipped out his security card and ushered me inside it.

 

In one corner of the room, sitting with his knees pressing his chest, was a bearded man in a hockey jersey and soiled blue jeans. He stared without seeing, rarely blinking, spittle spilling from his mouth corners. *Does he even register my presence?* I wondered. For a moment, his face seemed to contort into a terror mask…but then his mouth slackened again, and I had to wonder if I’d imagined the expression change. 

 

“This is Ruben,” my guide informed me. “He’s the last of our Nonlinears.”

 

“Nonlinears?” I asked.

 

“How can I explain this to you? Basically, our brains are filled with these cells called neurons—around 100 billion of them, supposedly—which process and transmit information all day long. Each neuron is electrochemically linked to at least 20,000 other neurons, sending and receiving signals through synapse connections. If not for them, our minds wouldn’t function properly.

 

“With the Nonlinears, we did a little brain tinkering, blasting their temporal lobes with intense dopamine bombardments to unlink the neurons associated with linear time perception. We weren’t sure what would happen, but the results defied all hypotheses.”

 

“What happened?” I asked, astounded.

 

“We discovered that by unlinking these selected neurons, we altered their time perception beyond anything we could’ve imagined. In fact, the tragic bastards ended up living every moment of their lives from that point onward simultaneously, all the way up to their deaths.”

 

“That’s amazing.”

 

“You’d think so, but experiencing a lifetime of sensations all at once is too much for *anyone* to process. That’s why Ruben doesn’t move. We feed him and clean him because he’s trying to do as little as possible, to limit his movement and sensations to a manageable level. He’ll likely remain that way until he expires, the poor guy.”

 

“So, what happened to the rest of the Nonlinears?”

 

“Some had immediate heart attacks, the sensation onslaught being too intense for their autonomic nervous systems. Some succumbed to brain aneurisms. The rest committed suicide in the most gruesome way imaginable, bashing their heads against the walls until their skulls caved in.”

 

“Good lord.”

 

“Only Ruben had the foresight to claim a corner for his own. Who knows what’s happening in that manic brain of his? Every communication attempt has been a failure thus far, just like the experiment itself.” 

 

The doctor ushered me out. “Well, that about concludes the tour. I could show you the bacteriology and virology labs, but you’d have to put on a biocontaminant suit before entering, and then take a chemical shower, followed by a regular shower, before leaving. It’s not worth the effort, trust me.”

 

“No problem. My mind’s blown already.”  

 

“Of course it is,” he chuckled. “So…have you made a decision? You’ve seen what we do here. Will you sell us your corpse?”

 

“For ten grand, it’s a no brainer,” I replied.

 

“Great! Step into my office and we’ll fill out all of the necessary paperwork. We’ll cut you a check and let you get back to your life.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Two weeks later, my wife and I were eating portabello tatin at a quaint French bistro. Sucking down Pierre Ponnelle Pinot Noir by the glassful, we contemplated a getaway cruise to the Bahamas. 

 

The check had cleared, and life was grand. No longer did we argue about money; no longer did I power through bags of miniature candy bars at my desk, searching in vain for a job that never existed. The ten grand would run out eventually, but until then I wasn’t going to let life get me down.

 

My wife made a joke. Laughing uproariously, I accidentally knocked over my wine. Dabbing it up with a napkin, I regretted popping a *6/7.9* pill before dinner, which had left me buzzed immaculate, just a stone’s throw away from drunk. I didn’t want to embarrass Beatrice, not when things were going so well. 

 

Neither of us desired dessert, so with our plates mostly emptied, I signaled for the check. Tipping the waiter a magnanimous twenty-five percent, I took my wife by the elbow and escorted her from the restaurant, into the sun-drenched day. There was a park across the street, a grass field framed with benches, containing no less than twelve picnic tables. To prolong our love’s rekindling, I suggested that we grab a bench, to watch a Hispanic family play croquet. 

 

“That sounds nice, dear,” Beatrice cooed, giving my hand a tender squeeze. I felt a decade younger, like it was our first date all over again, and it was going better than I’d hoped for. When the little green man appeared at the other end of the crosswalk, we strode forward leisurely, eyeing each other, not the surrounding traffic. 

 

Just as we passed the median strip, tragedy struck. At the sound of a horn blare, I glanced up to see a green Chevy Nova flying down the left-hand turn lane. Perhaps its bug-eyed driver hadn’t noticed the red light, or perhaps he didn’t care. Either way, I had just enough time to push my wife behind me, just enough time to brace for impact. With a great crumpling, I found myself ground under the vehicle’s polished metal grille.

 

I felt my bones grind and splinter, my liver burst. Drowning on lifeblood, I watched the world cloud over. Dying, I tried to speak Beatrice’s name, succeeding only in vomiting blood and bile onto the asphalt. 

 

Then I was gone, breeze-borne into oblivion. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When next my eyes opened, I beheld neither Heaven nor Hell—no harp-strumming angels, no demons cavorting around a lake of fire. Instead, I found myself strapped to a metal table in one of Investutech’s psychology labs, with a shorthaired Asian American doctor attempting to blind me with a penlight. 

 

“He’s awake, Dr. Landon,” the man announced.

 

In the background stood my erstwhile tour guide—smiling benevolently, sweat beads dotting his brow. “Welcome back, my friend,” he said. “I trust that you remember me.”

 

“Whaaa…haaapened?” I wheezed, my voice like a broken lawnmower. My skin was cold. I felt metal rods inside of me, where my bones had been. My outfit consisted of a hospital gown over thick layers of bandages. Even without drugs, there was no discomfort. It was like all of my pain receptors had been switched off. 

 

“There’s no other way to tell you but to leap right in,” said Landon, struggling for a soothing tone. “You were run over by a car in the middle of an intersection. You pushed your wife to safety, but lost your life in the process. In fact, your funeral started five minutes ago. They’re burying an empty coffin, however, as you signed your body over to us.”

 

“Youuu…brought meee baack.”

 

“We sure did. In fact, you’ve become the culmination of all our work at this facility. Most of your organs were ruined, so our tissue engineering division grew you new ones. A good portion of your skeleton was shattered, so we grafted steel bones into your physique. After that, with a strenuous application of galvanism, we actually brought the life spark back to your body. Your heart’s beating, and your neurons fire again. Now, if we can just figure out a way to stop the decay process, you’ll be good as new. You may even return to your wife someday.”

 

“Ah’m decaaaying?”

 

“Unfortunately, yes. It seems that your body doesn’t realize that it’s alive again. But our biomedical engineers are on the case, positing thermoregulation strategies even now. They should have your body generating heat again in no time.” 

 

“Whaaas wrong wiith my voiiiice?”

 

“Well, my friend, you did crack your head pretty hard on that crosswalk. Obviously, the trauma affected your brain’s language center. Once we stop the decay, perhaps we’ll look into repairing it.”

 

“Whyee am I straaapped doown?”

 

“Oh, that’s just a precaution. We’ve never tried something like this before, and had no idea what you’d be like upon waking. Dr. Lee, free our guest from his bonds, will you?”

 

The doctor did as instructed, allowing me to test my reflexes. They seemed unnaturally slow, as if the connection between my mind and musculature was on a time delay. After what felt like an hour, I *finally* slid my legs over the table and lurched to standing.

 

“Steady, steady,” Dr. Lee cautioned. “We don’t want you toppling over.”

 

Attempting to walk, I found my legs insensible. Indeed, I toppled forward. Fortunately, Dr. Lee was kind enough to catch me. 

 

“I warned you about that,” he grumbled, straining to brace me up. “Next time, we’ll…arggh!”

 

His screams were deafening. Groggily, I realized the source of his discomfort. For some reason, my body—operating on pure instinct—had me biting deep into Lee’s neck, gnawing frantically, my mouth filling with arterial blood. I was repulsed, yet couldn’t stop myself. A powerful appetite suffused me; it seemed it would never abate. 

 

Eventually, Lee’s screams faded. Landon tugged the corpse from my grip and I lurched in pursuit, tripping into a face plant. Losing consciousness, I heard the door slam behind them, locking me in my cell. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

For a while, I lurked in solitude, though I sensed observers just beyond the one-way glass. Time lost all meaning, as I no longer required sleep. Though I drank nothing, I felt no thirst, only that damnable hunger, that yearning for human flesh.   

 

With no entertainment options, I spent my time relearning to walk. It was more of a shamble, actually, as my knees refused to bend. Afterwards, I watched my body putrefy. 

 

First, my lower abdomen turned green. Then, in an embarrassing display, every bodily fluid, every bit of fecal matter, poured out of me. My face swelled balloonlike: mouth, lips, and tongue practically bursting. The swelling made even slurred speech impossible, garbling my every vocalization into soft moaning. 

 

My veins sprouted red tendrils, which later went green. Blisters erupted everywhere, suppurating pale, yellow fluid. Even my skin and hair began sloughing away. I won’t even mention the smell.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When Dr. Landon finally reappeared, this time flanked by two armed guards, I was in full-on undead mode. Landon offered no reaction to my appearance, but his eyes were sad. Gone was the jovial tour guide I remembered, replaced by a man who looked two decades older. Nauseous, the guards squinted at me, Glock 22s at the ready.

 

“Guuuuuhhhh,” I said, the best salutation I could manage under the circumstances. 

 

“Guh right back,” replied Landon. He hesitated for a moment, his face slackening sorrowfully. Regaining his composure, he said, “Well…I have some bad news, buddy. Because you slaughtered Dr. Lee, no scientist will go near you. This means that all efforts to stop, and even reverse, your decay have been suspended. In fact, Investutech’s board of directors has proposed returning you to the grave, allowing us to study your brain postmortem. Hopefully, we’ll be able to identify what prompted your blood lust and correct it before our next test subject arrives.”

 

“Nnnnnn.”

 

“I’m sorry, but that’s the situation. The final decision has yet to arrive, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up. The next time we enter your cell, it’ll most likely be to put you down. If it’s any consolation, though, your wife knows nothing of this. To her, you’ve been dead all this time. If Beatrice saw you now, who knows what it would do to her?”

 

The doctor’s practiced indifference disintegrated, as hoarse sobs burst through his quivering lips. Spilling tears, he exited the room, with both escorts trailing behind him. “I’m so sorry!” Landon called back, just before the door closed.

 

Starving and depressed, I threw myself from wall to wall. *I should’ve eaten all three of them when I had the chance*, I reasoned. *I’m already deadish. What could their guns possibly do to me?* Beneath the stained, tattered mess of my hospital gown, most of my bandages had peeled away. With every wall collision, my putrid body discharged flesh chunks, which only increased my agitation. Eventually, I collapsed, howling at the top of what was left of my lungs.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Time crawled interminably. My body dried out—darkening, acquiring a texture like cottage cheese—as its terrible death stench subsided. Internally, I visualized maggots wriggling throughout my organs, feasting on necrotic tissue. 

 

My shambling slowed, every step now a struggle. I have no idea what kept me ambulatory, kept my tormented spirit inside its moldering frame. Perhaps dark sorcery was involved.

 

Finally, Dr. Landon reappeared, accompanied by four guards this time, all with weapons drawn. “Well, my boy, the end has come,” he informed me. “I’d have brought a priest to pray over your immortal soul, but lab security doesn’t permit faith-mongers. Once again, I’d like to apologize for your situation. Sometimes good intentions breed monsters; sometimes all you can do is cut your losses and try to learn from your mistakes. Goodbye, my friend.”

 

The guards opened fire, sending a bullet spray through my torso, legs and arms. Feeling no pain, I stepped forward to meet them, as fragments of my living corpse splattered the floor behind me.

 

“It’s not working!” shouted one guard—a mulleted, red-faced ginger—right before I tore his head off. 

 

“Mmmmmwwwwah,” I moaned, reveling in the blood spray, wondering where my prodigious strength came from. It almost equaled my hunger. 

 

The next guard, I ripped his gun away, along with the arm holding it. In shock, his eyes rolling back into his skull, the brawny fellow dropped to his knees. 

 

I cracked the third guard’s cranium clean open. Consuming warm blood and squishy clumps of cerebral cortex, I would’ve slobbered, had my salivary glands still been operational. 

 

Dr. Landon, grasping the situation’s severity, turned on his heels and sprinted out of the room, hooking a right down the corridor. Naturally, I gave pursuit, pausing only to disembowel the fourth guard. 

 

Bloodlust lent new strength to my shamble. Resembling a mentally disabled child skipping, I positively flew down the hall. Catching up to Landon, I found him collapsed, hand to chest, gasping with an ashen face. Before the heart attack could claim him, I dashed his brains onto the floor and began to feed. 

 

With the doctor’s corpse picked clean, I grabbed his security clearance card and went back for the guards. Not that I was still hungry, mind you, but when visiting a buffet, you expect to gorge yourself.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Sirens blared overhead. Startled, I paused, clenching a dripping tendon between my teeth. They’d be coming for me, I realized, most likely in numbers I couldn’t fight through. Still, I had Landon’s key card and a memory of a fellow detainee: Ruben, the Nonlinear.

 

Two doors down the hall, I buzzed myself in. Ruben raised his eyes as I entered. I knew that this time he was really seeing me.

 

“You’re finally here,” he said, unafraid. 

 

“Ynnnnnn,” I confirmed, closing the intervening distance. 

 

My chin slick with the blood of my captors, I leaned over the Nonlinear. As my teeth met his flesh, he had just enough time to thank me. Then came gunfire and bloodletting, great gore eruptions amid a soundtrack of shrieking. The world began dimming; a red curtain closed.",1,1764525191.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

New manager here, officially starting my role tomorrow with a new team member.

A little background information, my previous small team disappeared in the past 3 months because everyone went and found better roles. I was about to leave for another role also until I was offered more money and a promotion because otherwise the entire team would've been gone. 

  
I am officially starting my role tomorrow and my first new hire will be starting. I designed an onboarding schedule to help my new team member get acclimated, learn the tools/skills and meet everyone else in the office.

  
I have plans to start off the day 1 with a quick chat, coffee (my treat), office tour, and space set up. Before sending her off to meet team members from other departments. Then regrouping to discuss expectations, goals, and the vision for this team moving forward. 

  
What other advice do fellow managers have regarding first day onboarding? I want to make sure the new team members feel welcomed and prepared. I kept the day super light and have a 30 minute day-breakdown chat at the end of the day.

  
All help appreciated.

Once I passed that invisible barrier words can’t describe the feeling of acceptance. I got a cup of good coffee and was so nervous I spilled the creamer shaking like a leaf. Had no clue the etiquette of this new reality. 

Listening to others and their struggles coupled with relatable coping strategies felt like a warm hug. Many of us have used ways to”spray and pray” issues that needed more accuracy but not wrong.

These meetings feel like zeroing in a scope for accuracy on life when you have been shooting into the oblivion rather than a target.

I haven’t drank in well over 3 months and never received a chip before and was given a 24hr chip, and then a three month chip.

But I do smoke weed which seemed to be taboo. I asked the member to my right about the 3 months chip and weed. He was 50/50 on if I should keep or return.

I gave it back although receiving this token…. It meant so much. It meant so much to hear others and how they have been meeting steps that are really great. 

The word G-d is used a lot however everyone believes in a higher power even if it’s inside yourself and feel this is left to interpretation similarly to The Art Of War. This esoteric manuscript has shaped society just as much as the bible. The Book Power is an interpretation of it.

Walking into this meeting was Devine guidance. It just happened to be on my nightly walk to decompress from the day and think on life.

I’m not necessarily an alcoholic yet I have had many times that would have defined the definition so it’s hard to define yourself as one.

Choosing not to drink is fine. 

Choosing not to blow Oxy is like turning down a beautiful woman on your bed with red silk sheets pulsating. 

After the fun is done it’s all alone again dirty and defiled.

I want to do better. I want to help others. I need to help my community. More than anything taking inventory of myself is the only way to achieve being better.

Thank you for letting me share my experience.

The ticket costs around $8 per ride, but if you plan to use public transportation for several days, it’s worth buying a Clipper Card and loading a MUNI pass.

The most photogenic stretch: Powell–Hyde going downhill toward Lombard Street with views of Alcatraz.

Tip: Avoid boarding at the main stops like Powell & Market. Walk 1 or 2 blocks and hop on at an intermediate stop, usually only a few people get on there and there’s no line.

1paoi8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1paoi8b/hmsf_levity/,[HM][SF] Levity,"I'd like to start this by affirming that I had no idea that the position held by Gravity was vacatable. That one day, Gravity might leave a note on their desk saying they can no longer put up with the job, so they're putting it down—that is to say, no longer putting things down. I never thought the job would be hard. I mean c'mon, think of the perks. The honor that comes with the status as a fundamental force, oh wait, that was mentioned in the note, ""I'm not a force! I'm a curvature in space-time. It's just a consequence of how... Never mind! No one understands me anyway..."" Well, there are other perks, but they must not be worth sticking around for.  

So be it then. I tried to drop the note, but instead it just floated in front of me. Going through the day will be interesting. When will Gravity find a replacement?  

There's a noise coming from the window in the front room. It sounds like shouting. People must be panicking about the sudden resignation. My toes miss the corner of my coffee table that I always seem to kick. Instead, since it's floating a foot in the air, the table connects with my knee then flies away. I try to rub my knee as it starts to throb. I limp to the window, or bounce really, and peer outside.  

My neighbor, Mr. Fineline, is in his yard doing a one-handed handstand on top of a garden gnome. Hang on, that's not right. He's 300lbs, and that didn't come from going to the gym. He's gripping onto the garden gnome in order to keep himself from flying away from the ground. He's shouting, ""Show me the statute! Show me where it says levitation counts as occupancy! Property taxation is theft!”. 

Every breath of air he takes sends a ripple through his body like gelatin. Now that his folds aren't weighed down anymore, he appears to be twice as nimble, and twice as big. Leave it to him to find the upshot of a situation.  

As I stare out the window, a chill comes over me. I look down and see that my robe has flown up behind me and has completely exposed me to anyone who has happened to look at my house. I quickly get a hold of all the fleeting and floating folds of fabric and rush into the kitchen. I haven't had my morning coffee yet. When I look at the counter, I am just in time to see the coffee machine with a clock starter kick on. I stare in disbelief as the machine blasts off the counter. The percolator acts as a rocket and sends hot coffee and grounds trailing behind it. 

I'm not dismayed by this. I am determined to get my morning coffee. I kick off the ground like a missile and aim for a floating globe of coffee. My body does a fly-by, and I stick my lips out like a straw trying to get a sip of the dark orb. As I near the other side of the kitchen, I land one foot on the wall and the other on the ceiling and kick off again. The coffee machine has started to orbit the ceiling fan scattering more globules of coffee across the kitchen. Then there's me, bouncing off the kitchen surfaces, the counter, the upper cabinets, and the ceiling. Chasing the caffeine beads like a cat chasing a laser pointer. 

At one point I'm lying flat on the ceiling as a stream of coffee heads straight towards my face. My mouth is agape waiting to be rewarded for estimating the stream's trajectory. Mr. Fineline floats past my kitchen window, no longer holding onto that garden gnome. He's now holding a Xerox machine in one arm, looking at documents in the other, and is pinching a phone between his shoulder and his ear yelling into it. ""My mortgage says 'land-based structure', and guess what? No land, no mortgage! Remove me from your records, or I'll sue."" 

I chuckle a bit. He seems to be the only person poised to act on the financial benefits of zero gravity. 

Suddenly, a new force steps into Gravity's old office and sits in the roller chair. The replacement is like Gravity but isn't used to the cosmic level of command that comes with the office. The roller chair doesn’t quite accommodate the new force’s size, so they reach down to the height lever and give it a slight tug. But instead of bringing the chair down to a more reasonable height, the chair quickly rolls to the side. In my kitchen, I am thrown against the wall. Just outside, Mr. Fineline is ejected from view, headed straight for the upper atmosphere.  

The new force must have lied on their resume. ",1,1764524942.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Episode 5 • Derivative

✦

The bathroom light hummed like it had opinions. Janna leaned into the mirror until the glass fogged her breath back at her and parted a curtain of blue-black hair with two fingers. There they were; faint, blooming low at her collarbone: ghost marks shaped like last night’s almost.

Heat rose before she could kill it. Hair down. Curtain closed. Olive beanie next, stretched the way a favorite lie stretches to fit new trouble. She tugged it low. No invitations. No yanking. Not today.

Toothpaste foam, mint and chalk, the quick metallic spark when she nicked her gum. Rinse. Watch the water spiral away like it had someplace better to be. The mirror threw her face back: boxy jaw, half-lidded stare, the tiny cleft in her chin everyone assumed she drew on. A tiny ghost of a smile ran through it and vanished.

She thumbed the fluorite pendant at her throat. Always cool until the after-warmth slid in. She pressed it to the pink seam of her chest scar; a quiet ritual: touch stone, feel the faint give of old tissue, wait for the click.

There. The small, polite vote her pacemaker cast for life: click… and the inner tide answering like water finding a shore. Some mornings the rhythm lined up. Others it didn’t. Today it flirted with sync and then… didn’t. She breathed until her pulse obeyed.
Heavy paws scuffed the hall. A soft mrrrp angled under the door.

“You’re nosy,” she told the wood.

The door nudged wider anyway. Holly shouldered in—black-smoke fluff, tail like a feather duster—and made figure-eights around Janna’s calves like the bathroom rent was hers. Janna scooped the cat for exactly one breath of face-in-fur and set her down before Holly could file a claim.

In the kitchen, oil hissed. Garlic, day-old coffee, lemon cleaner that tried too hard. Tala’s voice arrived first—bright, brittle hostess pleasant. “There she is. The birthday girl. Yesterday. How was your big night, Janna Rose? Quiet, I hope.”

“Wild.” Janna leaned in the doorway, hands in her coat pockets, beanie’s shadow low. “I jaywalked.”
Tala didn’t laugh. She almost never did when Janna meant it. “Mmm.” A plate scraped the counter a little too hard. “I pray you made wise choices. Breakfast?” Garlic rice, a fried egg, two slices of spam; a love language plated like a test.

Marino looked up from his mug. His eyes had Janna’s edges. He tipped his chin, a hello they both understood. “Ingat, anak,” he said, then softer: “Eat.”
Janna sat. Fork, egg, salt. She pretended not to feel Tala’s gaze hook and unhook; hairline, collar, olive knit armor. Pan hiss. Fridge kick-on. Under it, a bassline in her head from last night’s slow song: wordless, low, private ache.

Don’t mess this up. Don’t—

“Did you thank the Diazes?” Tala sang, paper-sweet. “For throwing you… what was it? A small dinner?”

“Yeah.” Janna chewed, swallowed, held the deadpan steady. “Marco cooks like he’s trying to bribe God. Star bought a mountain of squishpillows and overdrafted her account. Normal.”

Tala’s smile didn’t make it to her eyes. “That girl needs discipline.” Her gaze slid back to Janna’s throat like a cat testing a gap under a door. “And you. You need… boundaries.”

“Same,” Janna murmured at the plate. She cleared dishes, washed, set each one in the rack upright with defense-level efficiency. Click. The pacemaker chimed along with tiny votes of confidence.

Marino, gently: “You work today?”

“Yeah.” She slung her bag. “Double. Fill then register. Big day for capitalism.”

“Text if you need a ride.”

“Give me your schedule,” Tala said, wiping at a spotless counter. “We can talk tonight. About your… habits.” The pause was not kind.

“Can’t wait.” Janna kissed two fingers and tapped the air near Marino’s temple. She nodded at Tala because it was easier than not. Holly flopped to block the door, belly up.

“You’re dramatic,” Janna told the cat, stepping over with careful heel-toe.

Outside, Earthni was overexposed and pretending not to be tired. The Subaru coughed twice, then remembered how to be a car. Janna drummed the wheel while it reconsidered life. The bassline in her head came dressed as a good idea. She killed it with talk radio; no soundtrack today.

Visor check. Hair down, neck covered, beanie straight. Fluorite tucked where it could sit against skin. She tapped once; the pacemaker answered. Click. Okay. We’re doing this.

Three lights she always hit. The pumpkin-festival banner flapping itself to death over the intersection. The alley unicorn skull spray-painted over a traffic cone. She cut into Earthni Mart’s lot, parked under the eucalyptus with a shade footprint barely big enough for a hood.

Phone check.

Tom’s name she stared at until the screen went dark.
“Later,” she told the empty car, which could have meant him or her. She pocketed the phone, pushed the door, walked into the fluorescent day.
Inside, Cassie would already be humming at verification while Janna slid back into the groove she knew; no funny business, just work.
She palmed the pendant one last time, felt the tiny click inside answer like a friend knocking from the other side of a shared wall, and went to the bench.

✦

The pharmacy had its own weather. Cool air bleeding from the immunization fridge. Paper-dry labels that stuck to gloves. Citrus cleaner in tile grout that never gave up. Janna rode the rhythm she knew by muscle memory: scan, print, count by fives, snap-cap, bin. The work clicked. So did the small device under 
her sternum; quiet ticks in time with her hands.

“Maple, Kelly,” she called, because the system loved last names more than people—sliding a discreet brown bag to the plexi. “Medicated shampoo. Twice a week. Don’t drink it unless you want to fight a wizard.”

Kelly snorted, paid, floated off. Next: a compact little man with a beak nose and eyes too wide.
“Dennis Avarius,” he whispered, and then louder, “I mean—Ludo, picking up for Dennis.”

“Hydrate,” Janna said, passing the bag like contraband. He solemn-nodded and scurried.
Scanner sang. Printer squeaked. Cassie drifted by, set a cold water at Janna’s elbow, murmured, “Answer the phone on the second ring or it will summon a demon.”

“Too late,” Janna said. “I already know one.”

A tap at the window: skateboard helmet hooked on one finger, lean against plexi like it was a locker; Jackie Lynn Thomas, smile soft as summer.

Cassie flicked a hand without looking up. “Five minutes. Break bench.”

They slipped into the narrow staff alcove by the side door. Low sun painted the concrete. Cart wheels murmured beyond the wall. Janna peeled a glove, then the other, tucked them away so her hands had something to do.

Jackie sat, elbows on knees. “You good? You ghosted the cake and Irish-exited the group chat with a thumbs-up. That’s… a choice.”

Janna considered the mask. The bit. The lol, I’m fine, capitalism. She let her shoulders drop instead, told the truth in small, sharable pieces.

“I kissed Tom,” she said. “Then I freaked out and left. That’s the whole movie.”

Jackie’s brows climbed. Not judgment, data intake. “Huh. Was it bad?”

“It was good.” Janna grimaced, at herself mostly. “Embarrassingly good. Teeth clicked first try; he adjusted, because of course he did. Then I heard my heart get loud and my brain tried a mid-update restart. I panicked. Did the Janna thing.”

“What’s the Janna thing?”

“Run. Say something snarky. Pretend I don’t have a body. Dopamine rude.”

Jackie nodded like she’d been handed the weather. “Do you want him?”

“I want… to not melt when people are nice to me. To not be a science experiment when it’s my own feelings. To not mess him up.” A beat. “And maybe I want him,” she added, small.

“Keyword maybe.” Jackie nudged Janna’s sneaker. “You can want him and still move at your speed. That’s legal. You talk to him?”

Janna shook her head. “He called. I stared at his name and turned my phone face-down because I’m a champion.”

“Text something true and small,” Jackie said. “I liked it and I panicked. Or I need a minute, not a breakup. Don’t ghost. Ghosting makes people write whole movies without you. You don’t get to edit those.”

The fluorite was warm under Janna’s thumb. Click. “Ay naku. Sparkles would write him a haiku.”

“Sparkles writes a haiku for the toaster.” Jackie grinned. “You don’t have to be Star. You just have to be legible.”

Silence folded in, easy. A delivery truck downshifted out front. The intercom coughed an aisle special and cut. Janna traced a chipped line in the bench paint with her nail.

“You ever feel like everyone else got a handbook?” she asked. “How to say the right thing instead of hiding in an air vent?”

“All the time.” Jackie’s smile tilted. “Then I remember the handbook is practice. Some people are sparks. Some are slow matches.” She angled a look over. 

“You’re a slow match, Banana. That’s not wrong. It’s how you burn.”

Janna snorted. “You’re disgustingly well-adjusted.”

“Don’t tell anyone. I have a rep.” Jackie reached without asking and straightened the crooked tie of Janna’s smock. Tiny, grounding. “Skate Thursday? No pressure. I’ll bring extra pads for your heart.”

“I’ll pretend to fall on purpose. For the bit.”

“There you go.” Jackie popped up, helmet salute. 

“Text him. Drink water. Do your gremlin ritual after shift. Thrift loop, shrine raid, whatever. Ground yourself.”

“Second Wind,” Janna admitted. “Five minutes. In and out.”

“Uh-huh.” Jackie side-eyed. “Five minutes in gremlin time is forty-five in Earth time. Pace yourself.”

Back at the counter, Cassie hoisted a clipboard like a torch. “Alive?”

“Allegedly.” Janna tugged gloves on. Her phone buzzed:

> Tom: voicemail she didn’t open.
> Star: three hearts and a sparkles.
> Marco: need anything?
> 
Janna typed:
> Snacks later. No dragons.
> 
Last hour ran on rails. Insurance portal crashed and resurrected. The P.A. begged shoppers to take mercy on closing. Janna finished the C-II count with Cassie, double-signed the log, peeled the last of a stubborn label roll into neat coils.

“Take the deposit,”
Cassie said, sliding the locked bag. Voice softer: “Then go touch grass. Or whatever gremlins touch.”

“Dusty lamps. Chaos.”

Lavender evening outside. Strip-mall neon yawning on, one sign at a time. Across the lot, Second Wind glowed like a weird little lighthouse.

The pacemaker clicked, steady. Janna scratched beneath the beanie, smoothed it down, smiled at no one.

“Five minutes,” she told herself, heading for the door she always tried to slip past the bell.

✦

Second Wind smelled like dust, lemon cleaner, and stories that hadn’t been told yet. The bell tattled anyway. Janna let the pharmacy cadence drain out of her bones and switched to gremlin pace: slow, hunting, eyes low. Click. The pacemaker kept time. She breathed and counted in fives because Tara had accidentally taught her how to pray.

An old TV in the corner tried to manifest a goat. The goat winked. She winked back.

Aisle two: picture frames, half cracked, all haunted. 

Aisle three: coats from eight planets. She dragged fingers down a navy greatcoat; it hummed in a key she didn’t know and warmed her palm. Tempting. She moved on.

Bootsteps. Familiar cadence. Jacket she recognized before the face.

Tom.

He’d ditched the hoodie for a short jacket that made him look like he knew what he was doing. Bad assumption, charming line, still worked. He spotted her over a teetering tower of board games.

“Hey,” he said, like hello and question had decided to share a word.

Janna kept her expression neutral, the way you hold a cat you’re not sure wants to be held. “Hey, Hot Topic. Shopping for a cursed toaster?”

He lifted his hands. Palms open. “I—uh—came for a toaster. Breadcrumb possession. Also maybe for… you. To apologize. Properly.”

She pretended to examine a cracked snow globe with a tiny screaming Mewman trapped inside. The water sloshed teal. Her heart did not.

“Apologize for what?” she asked. Flat. Safe.

“For pushing,” he said, careful. “On your birthday. I read the porch wrong. I’m sorry.”

She slid the globe down and finally gave him her eyes. Three of his tried very hard not to look desperate. Golden retriever demon. Ugh.

“It wasn’t just you,” she said. “I liked it and my brain panicked. I do that. I’m not great at the whole feelings app.”

Something unclenched in his shoulders. Not relief, permission to breathe. “Okay. That helps.”

“Don’t get excited.” Heat threatened her ears under the beanie. “It was… good. Embarrassingly good. Teeth clicked first try; he adjusted, because of course he did. Then I heard my heart get loud and my brain tried a mid-update restart. I panicked. Did the Janna thing.”

He huffed a laugh. “Yeah. I heard your heart, too.” He winced at himself. “Not in a creepy way. Demon ears. 

Sorry.”

“Putik,” she muttered, cheeks going traitor. She grabbed a wooden sign: LIVE, LAUGH, LEVITATE. 

“Cute.”

He drifted closer but kept a bench-length of respectful space, like she’d taped off a perimeter only he could see. “I don’t want to make you run,” he said. “I like having you around—even if the price of admission is you roasting me.”

“You make it easy.” The edge of it softened. “Maybe I like having you around too. In small, medically supervised doses.”

“Copy.” Earnest as a pledge. “We can be whatever speed you want. Airlock pace. Your call.”

“Text, not calls.” She flicked her gaze at him. “Loud texting is just calling.”

He smiled, real arriving slow. “Can I walk you to your car when you’re done looting? No pressure. I’ll be the guy pretending to care about crockpots.”

She checked her own perimeter. The tick under bone stayed calm. “You can walk me to the door,” she said. “After I buy this extremely haunted coat.”

“It matches your aura,” he said, then winced like he’d tripped on sincerity. “Not a line.”

“Flattering people doesn’t work on me.”

“It’s not flattery.” He shrugged helplessly. “Truth leaking out. You’re you. It messes with me in a good way.”

“Gross,” she said softly—which, in Janna, meant thank you, stop now before my face commits to color.
They orbited a while. She paused at a MIXED HOUSEWARES & MINOR HEXES shelf, flipped a rippling hand mirror face-down. Cleared her throat. “I’m spacing myself. I need room to collect gremlin atoms. That’s not a breakup text; it’s an airlock. You knock; I open when I’m not a biohazard.”

“Airlock. Got it.” He nodded like she’d handed him a checklist. “I can knock. Quietly. With a text.”

“Text,” she repeated. “Good dog.”

He grinned. “I’m more of a three-eyed cat.”

“Don’t seduce any lamps while I pay,” she said, pivoting to the register.

He held a hand to his heart. “No promises if they have the wavy lava ones.”

She let a smile happen, killed it halfway for dignity. Phone buzz:
> Star: sparkles, how’s the gremlin hunt?
> Marco: grocery emoji, need anything?
> 
Tom’s name hovered under that, unread badge a tiny pulsing vein.

Later. Space first. Baby steps. She bought the coat; the cashier bagged it like it might chew through plastic. At the door, Tom matched her pace without touching. Jacket collar up. Evening coming on cool.
“Thanks for not being weird,” she said.

“I’m extremely weird,” he said. “Just trying to be useful about it.”

“Acceptable.” She unlocked the hatchback. “I’ll text. Don’t panic if it’s tomorrow. Or the day after. Or never.” Beat. “Kidding.” Maybe.

He backed away hands-up, giving her the last line. “Night, Ords.”

She watched him go, felt the gravity he’d joked about, chose not to name it. The fluorite warmed against her sternum. Click.

“Slow match,” she told the empty passenger seat. Got in. Drove home.

✦

The Ordonia house smelled like lemon polish and reheated sinigang. Janna eased the door with her hip, thrift bag hanging from two fingers. The old wall clock ticked—stuck—tick—like it couldn’t decide if time was real. Her pacemaker answered with tidy, private clicks.

“Where were you?” Tala didn’t look up. Phone face-down beside a mug. Mouth fixed in company smile.

“Work,” Janna said. “Then Second Wind.” Neutral weather voice.

Marino stood at the sink, dish towel crushed in his hands. A small chin-down—hey, anak. Janna almost nodded back, decided even air might set something off.

“Show me your neck,” Tala said.

“No.” Janna didn’t move. “We’re not doing checkpoints in the kitchen.”

“Janna Rose.”

The old name dropped like a plate in another room and woke a softer voice that wasn’t here anymore. Heat crawled Janna’s throat. The beanie suddenly felt two sizes too small. She could laugh the moment down. She didn’t.

Tala stood. Two steps closed the gap. Fingers slid through hair the way they’d learned to when Janna was eight and slow. They found the soft behind her ear and yanked.

White pain cracked clean. Every little hoop and stud along the cartilage screamed. Janna’s hand shot up on reflex. “Don’t—” Her fingers met Tala’s wrist—not hard, not soft. “Get off.”

“Hoy,” Marino warned.

Tala didn’t stop. She peeled hair and saw it: the faint mottled half-moons blooming along Janna’s neck, stubborn under concealer. She hissed breath through her teeth.

“Diyos ko.” Her voice thinned. “You let him put his mouth on you? That demon boy? Sa bahay ko? Before marriage?” The Tagalog spiked bright. “Ay naku, hindi ko kaya.”

Janna dropped her hand first, put space in the gap. The skin behind her ear buzzed like bad electricity. The pacemaker tried to herd her heart back into lane. Click. Click. She pressed the fluorite once—cool stealing edge from heat.

“It’s not what you think,” she said. Knowing it didn’t matter.

“What I think,” Tala said, smile thin as paper, “is you shame this house. Years of sneaking. Lying. With a Lucitor, from The Underworld!” The words landed like a curse. Her gaze dropped to Janna’s sternum like she could see through cotton to plastic. “Even that thing in you—click click—hindi normal. You are not normal.”

“Tama na,” Marino said, leaving the sink. Enough.
Tala ignored him, eyes hard. “Do you laugh about this with your friends? Do they clap? Nakakahiya. Your mother—”

“Don’t talk about her,” Janna said. Too even.

“Always hiding,” Tala went softer and meaner. “You hide your ears, your sins, the devil’s battery ticking in your chest. You think you’re clever. You’re a disappointment, Janna Rose.”

The words hit like coins thrown from a crowd. Janna let them. Weather on a horizon: okay, here it comes. The old clock ticked louder.

“I’m not a joke,” she said, when it was her turn. “And Tom didn’t do anything to you. This is you.”

“I am not your mom,” Tala said, like a mercy she wanted credit for.

“Yeah,” Janna said. “I know.”

Silence. The fridge motor, the wire between two people tighter than string. Tala’s fingers trembled once on the chair back. Marino’s jaw had gone tight around the thing he wouldn’t shout.

“Give me your phone,” Tala said. “Now.”

“No.”

“You were posting your little pictures. Acting cute. I see everything. Phone.”

Janna let the thrift bag swing. “No.”

“Then get out.” No shout. No drama. Just a line pressed hard enough to tear paper. “Kung ayaw mong sumunod, umalis ka.”

“Anak—” Marino started, helpless.

“It’s okay,” Janna said, and almost made it true. She hooked the bag in her elbow and took the stairs. Lemon polish and tamarind rose like a different memory. She stepped over the third stair without looking; squeaks avoided by reflex, and took the next two quiet as a cat.

Her door sighed. Paper and dust and eucalyptus. Posters heavier now, thrift frames instead of tacked nails. Bedspread smelling like soap that didn’t make her itch. Holly lifted her head and mrrrped, offended by principle.

“Hey, Hol.” Janna scratched big ears, felt the lean of trust. “We’re transferring to the car version of a studio.”

She moved like she’d been rehearsing in the back of her skull for months: backpack open. Chargers. Spinny ring tin. Black cami. Socks rolled like tiny planets. Toothbrush in a plastic sleeve she’d stolen off-realm because the dinosaur made her laugh. Beanie adjustment kit. Brush that didn’t eat hair.

Top drawer: catch she always forgot, give she always remembered. Under shirts, the polaroid: her mother in a sundress, half-smile that didn’t have to try; four-year-old Janna in an olive beanie too big, laughing at something off-frame. The fluorite she’d left on the desk for morning rituals lay there tonight because she’d rushed. Her throat pricked; the pacemaker ticked hard enough to feel with fingertips. She slid both into the backpack’s inner pocket. Safe.

Under the desk, the carrier scraped linen. Holly eyed it, did the math of dignity versus routine, and climbed in with the sigh of a queen boarding a coach. Janna latched the little door. Closet tote swallowed the haunted coat and Docs. She grabbed the coat anyway and shouldered it like armor someone else might believe in.

Voices floated up, turned liquid by distance.

“…hindi ganyan,” Marino said. Not like this. “She’s working. She’s trying. She—”

“Working where?” Tala snapped. “A grocery pharmacy? Para kanino? You saw her neck. Demonyo, Marino. Demonyo. I warned her. I warned you.”

“She’s twenty-one,” Marino said, voice rough with something he hadn’t said in years. “Huwag mong idamay si Luzvaminda.”

Tala laughed like glass. “Cursed. That woman was cursed. And now—”

The rest smeared. Janna’s grip tightened on the carrier handle till the tendons stood. Behind her ear, skin pulsed where fingers had pinched. The old child-flinch rose and passed. She pressed the fluorite through fabric and breathed. Click. Patient as a teacher tapping a board.

Backpack. Carrier. Hall. The picture wall: school photos ending sophomore year; Marino’s fishing hat crooked on a nail; a saint whose eyes followed you out of rooms.

“Hindi ko kaya,” Tala said below, spent. I can’t.

“Anak,” Marino called, not loud. He wouldn’t shame her. Just set the word in the air in case it knew where to land.

Janna walked down without touching the rail. At the bend, she almost said I’m sorry to the lemon-polished wall, decided walls didn’t care. Kitchen doorway.

Tala’s mouth tightened at the carrier. Marino looked at bag, beanie, eyes, and something quiet in his face folded.

“Don’t touch my room,” Janna said to both, to no one.

Marino nodded. “Ingat.”

Tala’s hand found her mug and found it empty. She didn’t answer.

Janna adjusted the beanie with one fingertip; habit more than fix, and walked out. The door clicked, small and civilized. Porch bulb buzzed once and held. Night smelled like cut grass, cooling asphalt, Mrs. Abad’s eucalyptus that always lied about rain. The carrier swung against her knee. Holly mrrrped, then loafed.
Her heart tried to sprint. The pacemaker met it, set pace, held. She walked to the Subaru without looking back.

✦

The car coughed, and found its old sewing-machine purr. Janna buckled the carrier like a toddler and steered into a drive-thru that had been a smoothie place last year and a dry cleaner the year before. The sign now read: BURGER PLANET. Two moons. A smiling pickle.

Her throat felt raw. Perfect: birthday week plus cold. Great.

“Stay with me, Hol.” She tapped the carrier. Holly issued a judicial mrrrp and loafed harder.

Speaker crackle. “Welcome to Burger Planet where condiments are a lifestyle—what can I—”

“Oskar?” Janna leaned, squinted toward the lit window. Profile. Messy hair. Keytar case leaning behind the soda tower like it paid rent.

Beat of delighted static. “Janna Ordonia? Dude. Hey.”

“Funding the art with pickle checks?” she deadpanned.

“Keytar strings are—okay, not real. But the spirit of strings is expensive.” His grin warmed the wire. “Star-shaped nugget experience?”

“Large fries, extra salt. Coffee the size of my regrets. Chamomile tea for a cat.”

“We have… water.”

“Put it in a cup. For the fluff princess.”

“Copy. Second window for illegal hand-offs.”

At the window, Oskar slid it open. His visor failed at hair-taming. Glitter smear on his cheekbone like a cosmic scar.

“You look good,” he said, startled by his own mouth.

“Got banned from Britta’s for beating up Sensei Brantley and stealing secret sauce weekly,” she said. “Had to glow-up for court.”

He barked a laugh. “Iconic. Also I put in a good word. Sauce is fine.”

He passed the coffee and fries heavy with promise. Slid a water cup through the carrier hatch like bartending VIP. Holly sniffed, decided hydration was vulgar.

“You okay?” Oskar asked, the window frame turning confessional. “Heard, uh, birthday. Then a vibe.”

“Yeah.” She watched steam fog the lid. “Birthday accomplished. Vibe… canceled.”

He didn’t press. Oskar had always been alarmingly gentle for someone powered by nachos and noise. “You want extra honey mustard?”

“For medicine.”

“For science,” he corrected, dropping two packets like contraband.

Knuckles touched. His were cold. Janna’s were steadier than expected.

“Stay weird, Ordonia.”

“Already under contract.” She rolled away.

The mall lot yawned open, sodium lamps dusting everything the color of old bones. She nosed the Subaru into a back corner under a sleepy eucalyptus and killed the engine. Quiet rang in her ears. A dragoncycle coughed in the distance. Fries made a cheap shrine of the cabin.

Janna opened the carrier. Holly emerged in precise increments, took her lap with the solemn authority of a prescription cat. Janna fed her a sacramental fry end, tore honey mustard, dunked, ate, breathed. Coffee lit a small sun behind her sternum.

Phone face-down on the dash buzzed itself brave. Cold light lifted the cabin.
> Tom 🔥: I’m so sorry about earlier. Didn’t mean to push. Please talk to me when you’re ready. I’ll give you space. I just… care about you a lot.
> Star ✨: sending cat hug gif x1000. love u banana. here if u need me 💫
> Marco 🥋: You good?
> Jackie 🛹: Drink water, chaos goblin.
> Papa 👔: Good night, anak.
> 
The coil behind her breastbone drew tight, then loosened with a click. The fluorite rested warm like it had borrowed sun. Janna stroked Holly’s ears with the backs of her fingers and typed:
> To Tom: I need a little space. Not your fault. I’m just… me.
> 
Ellipses popped, vanished, returned.
> Tom 🔥: Can I call? If not, I won’t.
> 
She watched her own reflection resolve in the glass: beanie, shadowed eyes, that faint heat on her cheeks. “Sure,” she said, and answered before she could think herself into a hole.

“Janna?” Tom’s voice—cautious warmth. “Hey. I—”

“I’m okay.” She rounded the edges. “You didn’t do anything wrong.”

He breathed, shaky. “Are you sure? Because I keep replaying and—”

“Don’t.” Her breath ghosted the glass. “I… wanted it. Then my brain did the Janna thing. Diagnostics: panic. I bailed.”

A porch-step pause. “Okay. Thanks for telling me.”
“I’m sleeping in my car tonight,” she added, then decided to leave it there. “Don’t freak. Holly’s with me.”

“…Do I ask why?”

“You don’t. Not yet.” The coffee had gone metallic. “I just need a buffer. A week?”

“A week,” he said, like a spell he intended to keep. “Text me if you need anything. Or dumb memes. Especially dumb memes.”

“Always.”

“Janna?”

“Hmm.”

“I’m here.”

Simple landed where it needed to. Her chest stopped trying to sprint. Click. Click.

“Mahal kita,” she said, so soft it could’ve been signal noise.

“What’s that mean?”

“Gibberish.” She wiped one eye with the heel of her hand, surprised to find it wet. “Go to sleep, golden retriever.”

He laughed, fragile and real. “Night, gremlin.”

She hung up before she could wreck the landing and thumbed airplane mode. The cabin dimmed. 

Outside, eucalyptus whispered a fake rain. Holly kneaded the hoodie at Janna’s ribs, then sprawled, purring in a frequency that resonated with plastic and bone. 

Janna reclined in small clicks until the world fit.
The fluorite under her palm gave a near inaudible chime. Far across town, in a lab with too much glass, a teal line on a monitor spiked, then settled.

“Good gremlin,” Janna murmured to the stubborn heart that refused to be only machine. She tugged the beanie down a notch and let sleep take her, the Subaru cooling around her like a small planet holding orbit under two moons.

1paobj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1paobj0/aita_for_resenting_my_family/,AITA for Resenting my Family?,"So this is VERY LONG and I apologize. I also wrote about this a few days ago, but deleted the post because I wanted to rewrite it with more info. But I (23F) live with my parents and two sisters, ""Chelsea"" (29F) and ""Kelly"" (26F). I want to preface this by saying that I love my family and my parents do everything that they can, and that everyone in the house is a great person, this is just a sticky situation in the family. 

Chelsea has Asperger Syndrome and Kelly has autism as well as severe intellectual disabilities and some physical disabilities as well. 

Chelsea is not very helpful. While she does have some mental health challenges, she does not have a job (nor is she looking), and is basically a freeloader by choice. She does the dishes and laundry to make her rent because she doesn't have a job, but she is constantly behind or just flat out doesn't do it some days because she doesn't feel like it, and she does not have any consequences when she does not do her ""job."" She does nothing to help around the house unless specifically told/asked to (she has gotten better but it's still not where it should be) and is very immature. I find myself constantly having to do things for her. Meanwhile, I have a full time job and still have this parental responsibilities.
She also struggles with OCD and intrusive thoughts, but instead of doing anything to help herself, she has turned us into her therapist, always asking questions if she is being crazy about things (which any sane person would be able to answer). I would be more empathetic if she did anything to help herself get better, but she does not. She just turned the family into her therapist, which is very draining. And another thing she does is always inserting herself into my life. I make friends, she becomes friends with them too. I join a choir, she joins too. And since she knows everyone I know, I don't have anyone I can vent to except for my boyfriend and boss, nor do I have an escape from her except at work or at my boyfriend's place.

Because of her disability, Kelly can get aggressive sometimes. She also screams at the top of her lungs and bangs on whatever furniture she can. The house is VERY tense because of this. She is also not toilet trained (part of her disability). Imagine wiping your sibling's private parts, ESPECIALLY when she's on her period. Another thing she will do is nag you over and over to sing a certain song or recite things from her favorite tv shows and movies (that's the only way she plays) to the point where you are about to explode. But of course, with the nagging and misbehavior, I don't want to play with her. But if you refuse, where does that leave you? With more screaming and banging. This has taken a real toll on my mental health and makes me want to run away.

After nearly 10 years of this, because of the responsibilities I should have never had, I have grown resentment toward my sisters. Chelsea for freeloading and never helping out, and Kelly for her aggression. 

I also have been having problems with my parents recently. I have ADHD, and if I forget to take my medicine I get lectures the next day on how obnoxious I get and how I am difficult to be around (which of course hurts to hear that they only enjoy me when I'm medicated). When my patience runs short and I snap at someone (usually Chelsea), I get lectured and are made to be the villain. I like to fake tan, and my mother expresses her disapproval for it to the point where I get afraid of her finding out if I buy/try new tanners. My parents have to know where I am at all times. When I drive, I need to let them know as soon as I make it to my destination, and if I don't, the whole family will bombard me with texts and calls to see if I am there (which forces me to text and drive sometimes to avoid that). One time I was even accused of sneaking out with a boy (which I have NEVER done) because I was taking my time at Hobby Lobby. And I can't even dress the way I want sometimes, as my dad will even get mad if I wear things like onesies out (just going to a store) as he says they make me look like a child and people will want to traffic me. They will also ask me to do things for them (like make them coffee) that they could easily do themselves, and they'll often ask me to do these things instead of Chelsea because they think it's easier to just get me to do things. 
I have tried talking to my parents about the issues I have with them and my sisters, but over time I have learned to stop telling them things, as nothing ever changes, and they sometimes even give me reasons on why I shouldn't feel this way toward my family. 

After all of that, I have started to resent my parents (just a little bit, not nearly to the extent of my sisters). Feeling this way is, of course, very difficult for me, but I'm not allowed to have emotions either. If I cry (whether a happy or sad cry) or get mad, my dad gets mad at me, which forces me to bottle up my feelings to try to keep the peace (because when either of my parents are in a bad mood, they put the whole house in a bad mood as well). Because I can't talk to my family without being dismissed and I can't cry or have emotions (healthy coping mechanisms), I have turned to other (usually less healthy) things. When I go shopping, I am criticized for spending too much money (which I will admit, I do). When I eat, I am told that I am gaining weight (my family also knows that I have problems with gaining weight and disordered eating), sometimes I will get nostalgic over things from when I was actually allowed to be a child, and I get judged for playing Webkinz or watching my favorite Barney episode from when I was 5.

There's more I haven't mentioned, but if I mentioned everything that goes on, we would be here all day. I just don't even know what to do anymore. Unfortunately, I cannot move out at the moment, because my boyfriend and I are planning on getting engaged soon (we are Catholic and don't believe in living together before marriage), and need to start saving up for a place about an hour away. I want to ask him to propose earlier so I can get out of here sooner, but I don't want to rush him into marriage. So unfortunately, I am just stuck here for now. 

But I am also hesitant to leave my family anyway. Since I am so heavily relied on in the house, what will happen when I'm gone? Will the family fall apart? And I know how crappy this situation is and I don't want to put this burden on anyone else either. 

So where does all of this leave me? It has taken a toll on my mental health to the point where I get depressed sometimes, I'm short with my family, I often want to just run away, and the smallest inconvenience feels like the biggest thing in the world. It's even gotten to the point where I can get in a bad mood just from one of them walking into the room or simply hearing one their voices. I feel really guilty and a-holey for feeling this way about them, but I do feel that way. I love my family, they are all great people, and I want relationships with them, but if this continues, I don't know if I will be able to. So, AITA for feeling this way, and since I cannot currently move out, what should I do?",3,1764524505.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I want your honest opinion on what I felt during this race to help me . ChatGPT is putting it down to cramping due to bi carb but I want some advice from humans please!! 

I just raced a 10k today . I’ve been doing about 70 miles a week for this block and was aiming for around sub 35.30 however - during the last week I had a cough so accepted I might just run around 36-36.30 as I was feeling better. ( for context I ran 17.04 in September in 5k ) 

I usually do my speed sessions in the Nike zoomfly 6 ( great shoe ) 

Anyway - the course was hilly and I have been mainly training on flat ground this time 

Of which my race routine was

Coffee and bagel with jam 
Nomio ( 3 hours before ) 
Beetroot shot( 2.5 hours before ) 
Bi carb 2 hours before 
Espresso 
Small glass of water 
Caffeine gel and ketone IQ half an hour before race 

I wore a new pair of alpha fly 3s too

The first 3 miles I felt great ! Was happy with how I was feeling however after the first 2.9 miles my legs felt like they were getting majorly tired and I mean - feeling like I’d ran a marathon. This continued until obviously the last 400m where I sprint finish ! My breathing and heart rate were slightly below where I would expect to be for a 10k but I simply couldn’t move my legs .

When I got home I couldn’t get out of the car , my partner has massaged and sorted me out so I can walk again and feel fine now . No Dom’s and can run again ( feel like I’ve done a session ) 


In your opinion is it a lack of fitness ? Or is there something else at play! I think I’m using way too many supplements and might cut out the majority 

Any advice would be appreciated . I run my sessions well and I am feeling good but it’s the races I want my results to show !

# Key Features of Pictory

I’ve been relying on Pictory to turn my long-form blog content and webinars into engaging social clips and YouTube videos, and honestly, it keeps getting better.

Here are the best features of Pictory that you will find yourself using constantly:

# The Text-Based Editing

This is still the killer feature, but it’s gotten much better. You don’t edit a timeline; you edit a script.

* **Editing by Deleting Text:** You can upload a long Zoom recording or a podcast transcript. If you delete a sentence from the automatically generated text transcript, Pictory instantly removes that corresponding audio and video segment. It’s the fastest way to trim filler words (“um,” “ah”) or remove a tangent from a long video—you never touch a timeline.
* **One-Click Highlights:** For a 30-minute webinar, the AI can now auto-summarize the key points and generate a 60-second highlight reel *for you*. It intelligently selects the most engaging segments and b-roll. You literally just click “Create Highlights,” and your social media teaser is done.
* **ReelFast Technology:** When you need a quick social media clip, the generation speed is lightning fast. I can take a 2,000-word article and get a fully captioned, music-backed video storyboard in minutes.

# AI Studio: Generative Visuals and Consistency

This is the big new upgrade in 2025. Pictory can now create visuals on its own instead of relying only on stock footage.

* **Text-to-Image Generation:** When I paste my script, if the stock footage library doesn’t have the perfect scene (say, “a tired robot drinking coffee on Mars”), I can use a prompt to generate a unique image or background *right inside* the editor. It saves me from going to a separate generator.
* **Brand Consistency with AI:** You can upload a reference image of your character or visual style. Pictory then uses that as a guide to produce new scenes with the same look across your videos, so your branding stays consistent throughout.
* **Getty Images and Storyblocks Integration:** On the higher-tier plans, you get access to millions of premium stock videos and images from major providers like Getty Images. This means your videos look professional, and you never have to worry about copyright issues.
* **Multiple Brand Kits:** You can save several Brand Kits, each with its own logo position, introduction/outro scenes, colour palette, and custom fonts. This is perfect if you manage content for different client brands or multiple YouTube channels.

# Advanced Content Repurposing Automation

Pictory isn’t just for bloggers anymore; it’s for anyone sitting on a mountain of long-form content.

* **URL-to-Video Transformation:** I just drop in the URL of my latest blog post, and Pictory handles the rest. It reads the article, extracts the main points for the script, selects relevant stock footage (from their massive Getty Images library), and generates a voiceover. It’s a true set-it-and-forget-it workflow for turning text into a video draft.
* **Automated Resizing and Formatting:** You can instantly convert your finished video into the perfect aspect ratios for every platform—horizontal (16:9) for YouTube, vertical (9:16) for Reels/Shorts, and square (1:1) for LinkedIn. It also repositions captions and visuals for each format, which saves a lot of manual editing time.
* **Hyper-Realistic AI Voices:** The synthetic voiceovers now include more natural inflection and better pacing. If you’re creating videos without showing your face, the multilingual options are amazing for reaching a global audience.

If you have a lot of written content or long videos and need to produce high-quality, short-form social videos *fast* without spending hours on a complicated editing suite, Pictory is an absolute powerhouse.

# Pictory AI Pros and Cons

# Pictory Pros

* **You’ll Save So Much Time:** Pictory is all about speed. You can literally paste a blog post or script, and the AI will turn it into a video draft—with visuals, music, and captions—in minutes. It’s perfect for turning your old content into quick social media clips.
* **It’s Easy to Use:** You don’t need any video editing experience. The interface lets you edit the video by just editing the text transcript, almost like working in a simple document.
* **Massive Media Library:** You get access to millions of royalty-free stock videos and images from places like Getty Images, so you don’t have to hunt for visuals yourself.
* **Great for Repurposing:** It automatically creates highlights and resizes videos for different platforms like TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram with a single click.

# Pictory Cons

* **It’s a Paid Tool:** There’s a limited free trial, but to get watermark-free, longer videos and access to the best features, you’ll need a subscription, which can be a barrier if you’re only an occasional creator.
* **Creative Control is Limited:** If you’re used to professional tools like Adobe Premiere, you might feel constrained. You can’t do complex animations, custom effects, or detailed colour grading—it’s mainly template-based.

1pao6qh,https://i.redd.it/p5wdh1kdkf4g1.jpeg,Cat OBSESSED with toy help!,"This is my Ziggy who is roughly 6 or 7 years old. He has always been a playful cat and I love that about him. However, lately he’s become very obsessive with one toy in particular. It’s a luring toy with a long string but he doesn’t want to play with the string end he likes the stick part because it’s hollow and has little bells inside that jingle when it moves. 

For context, a year ago we had to move in with family due to me being diagnosed with POTS and needing help due to frequent fainting (I’m in the process of getting disability). Previous to this I had rented a two bedroom two story condo that was set up for the cats to play (wall climbs, multiple  cat trees etc). 

Knowing the sudden change in space would be hard on him and his brother I made sure to start a daily playing routine with them. It was fine at first but now it’s gotten to the point where that’s all Ziggy wants to do. I wake up and he brings me the stick. I sit down to do anything (eat, sleep, the restroom, etc) and he brings me the stick. He literally follows me around the house ALL DAY LONG with the stick. I am starting to hate the sound of the fucking stick. It’s gotten to the point where if I sit down and ignore him to do anything he’ll come and headbutt whatever is in my hand out of it (this has led to multiple cups of hot coffee being spilled on me and himself) and run towards his stick and start screaming and digging at the carpet.

I haven’t seen him like this since I made the mistake of getting a laser pointer when I first got him. He would spend all day panting looking for the dot if you even turned it on for a second. Now he spends all day with his stick. 

I know there have been a lot of changes and I love playing with him, but this has got to be an unhealthy level of obsession right? I’m worried he is gonna be upset if I put the stick away for a while but at the same time I feel like he needs to have a break from dragging it around the house, I know I do. I’m starting to wonder if he has ocd atp and if it’s mean or harmful to take the stick? ",4,1764524199.0,cats,0,1.0,False

1pao528,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_narrans7thending/comments/1pao528/the_foundhers_chapter_two_available_now/,The Foundhers | Chapter Two Available Now,"Once again, his mom chimed in. “Are you sure you remembered to take your medication? Because sometimes we think we’ve done something, but we haven’t. Just the other day, I thought I refilled the coffee pot but turns out I hadn’t.”

“Yeah, I’m sure. I…”

“Little things just slip through the… oh… well… you know what I mean,” his mom interrupted. Something in her sympathetic eyes almost seemed strained. Forced. “Do you think that you might’ve missed the window? Experienced a lapse?”

“No, I don’t think that happened either. I made sure…”

“You have your timers set and everything, right?” his dad added.

“Yes. Yes! Of course. I have timers pretty much at every hour leading up to it,” urged Zavier.

“Do you feel it working? Like, when you take it?” asked his dad.

“You’re taking the right dose, right? Because, you know, Dr. Keane also said that attempting to adjust your medication if you don’t feel like it’s working can lead to a more spontaneous shift,” noted his mom. “And, with it being what it is, we need to make sure it’s lasting the full prescription. Right? I mean, with insurance what it is, we have to make sure you’re keeping to the correct dose and schedule. You are, right?”

Guilt plagued him. He knew he was doing everything he could, so he just kept nodding. His parents were asking questions in rapid succession now, bouncing off one another like a ping pong match. His chest was feeling tight. The back and forth was all-encompassing. Every question felt like something personal, like he’d done something to trigger the event. The world felt like it was spinning. Everything was just noise. His shoulders were shaking. Jaw clenching. When did he last breathe?

**Why This Pick?**

The Commanders have lost their last 6 games and clearly lack direction. Switching between Daniels and Mariota all season long surely hasn’t helped with consistency, and neither QB has been able to deliver when it counts. On the other side, Denver is 9-2 – and despite many of their victories being narrow ones, I’m confident they’ll cover here simply because Washington hasn’t covered in the same previously mentioned 6 straight outings. I do think Denver’s offense needs some work, but the Commanders’ defense has been abysmal and I don’t think Denver will have to work too hard. The Broncos are rested and the Commanders are flailing – I’m on Denver to cover here.

1pao3at,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gkuhlman.spro,Android and iOS users - I built Spro a coffee journaling and discovery app and it is live on all platforms!,"Hey r/espresso!

I've been building out [Spro](https://www.spro.so/) a website and app for logging your coffees with brewing parameters as well as discovering and sharing new beans and we are live on android!

I wanted to build a centralized place for exploring coffee.  I wanted to look at roasts by varietal, roaster, farm, etc.. and then save the ones I've have and bookmark the ones I want, so I built it!

It's kind of like Letterboxd at it's core: you can mark beans as favorites, drank, or wantlist - but you can also throw on your espresso parameters or your brewing recipe.

We add coffees nightly and have surpassed 2000 this month, but you can always add your own.

There are a handful of cool features like

* [Flavor Space](https://www.spro.so/flavor-space)
* Filtering reviews w/ recipes by equipment (So you can copy someone else)
* Advanced search to find something really specific (think natural process from colombia)

If you're interested in checking it out, you can sign up at [https://www.spro.so](https://www.spro.so/) and I will send out an email blast with invites to the Android beta this week.

  
Android here: [Spro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gkuhlman.spro)

This story is a continuation and a further exploration of one of the side stories from my book (**THE MEMORY PLACE**, first ever one I have written actually). The narrative is completely original and the knowledge of the book is not required to understand any of it. That's all. Enjoy.

https://preview.redd.it/gzem70agjf4g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd7bfc29c2701f63add47043e1696fe9a1ee2e30

  
  
**The Memory Place: One-Way Magician**

“Hey so anyways I was wondering if you’re doing anything tonight?”

“No, not really, I only have sleep on my agenda. Why do you ask? What’s up?”

“Oh… do you wanna hangout? Watch this movie I picked up, at my place?”

“Oh, uhh… sure I’d like that. Which one did you get?”

“‘Unsettled Admirers’”

“I haven’t heard of that one”

“Me neither, it looked interesting though”

“What’s it about?”

“It’s about two people who have feelings for one and the other. Though they don’t know each other, they have never crossed paths directly, never interacted face to face. The only exposure each has of the other being a distant and a secretive one. The narrative follows both of them trying to leave the other hints of their admiration, but each of their attempts always goes unnoticed. Which leads to one of them coming to terms with his love not being mutual and with the other turning to sinister actions due to the other's dismissal of her love""

“That does sound interesting, can’t wait to see it”

“Super, okay how does eight o’clock sound to you?”

“Perfect”

“Okay then, see you at eight Carrie”

“See you”

I wonder if he’s going to make a move tonight. I want him to. I don’t have enough courage to do so myself. The length which my courage encompasses always just reaches with me leaving slight hints of my interest in my verbiage and nothing more potent than that.

I get off from work in the following couple of hours once the arrows stop at five. I share a ‘see you’ with him once again and leave for home. I overanalyze every bit of adjustments I make to my makeup or to my clothing and I dart my eyes a tiresome amount to the clock as it marches closer to the date. I make final alterations to me and leave my house getting into my car driving to his house. I play through it: how our conversations will go like, how our actions will go like, how our feelings will go like, will they be pushed around enough for them to finally tip over staining and spilling all over his carpet or will they stay dormant, am I putting too much allure where it doesn’t belong, is this just a regular get-together without any implications to be perceived or sent out. I guess I’ll find out. I arrive on his street, I exit my car and approach his front door. My bent fingers give way for a knocking to reverberate all around his wooden door. The door soon briskly swings open.

“Hey Carrie, you made it, it’s great to see you, come on inside”

“Hi, it’s good to see you too”

We go inside.

“You look stunning by the way”

“Oh, thank you, I appreciate that”

“I’m sorry about my attire, I feel heavily underdressed""

“No, no you’re fine, you’re home after all, you should be allowed to dress the way you want”

“Yeah, but still… okay come, here take this and sit down wherever you like on the sofa, I’d recommend this side, sofa’s a little lopsided”

“I’m sure it’s not that bad… okay never mind, that side is like sitting on a plank”

“I told you… Alright, the movie is in the DVD player, it's ready to go, but first I want us to do something else, if you don’t mind…”

Is this going to be the implication?

“...Do you wanna take a picture? Just to keep it as a memory of this night”

“Oh, yeah… sure, that’s cool”

“Is everything alright? You seem a little caught off guard”

“Yeah, yeah it’s just…”

I scramble my brain for any excuse that won’t incriminate me.

“...it’s just that I don’t look so great right now, I’m worried about that”  
“That’s not true, you look really beautiful”

“Thank you… so where’s the camera?”

He smiles and takes out a small digital camera from his pocket, he sets it up on the front table and rushes back down next to me.

“It’s on a ten second timer… uh… what should we do? What face should we make?”

“Maybe we should just smile”

“Yeah, but that’s too bas-”

Snap.

“-ic. Darn, it took it”

He leans over, extending his hand across the table, retrieving the camera and turning its screen in our direction.

“I kinda like that actually, you know it’s a first attempt, nothing preplanned or exercised, it just has this level of realness to it”

“You’re right, it does have that authenticity to it. I think this is the one… and with that out of the way are you ready for…for…”

He picks up a CD case, turning it over and looking at the cover. 

“...’unsettled admirers’”

He picks up the remote and the movie starts. The movie was around two hours long. All we did for these two hours was sit and look ahead, sometimes making comments, making noises of crunching, making noises of laughter and then the movie ends. I end up getting up, we end up sharing a hug and I leave out of the door I came in through.

**Perspective Switch**

A day as blend as any, I sit in my kitchen, it’s morning, I’m drinking coffee and reading a newspaper. I look up, down, to the left and right, nothing, but a single piece of advert captures my whole sight and attention. I run through the very last sentence once and afterwards I retrace the words and run through it again and again, I sound the words out:

“Bring us a photograph which includes you in it, taken during the point in past time you want to revisit and we can put you back into your old shoes one or many more times”

I dig deep in my head about the meaning and ultimately the best use I would have for such a trip. I think about fitting the utilization into all aspects of my life, but no matter where my mind trails off to it never can escape a common denominator across all my thoughts. It’s clear how much effect she has on me. It’s clear how much she means to me. It’s clear that my love for her is strong, but my courage is not. My words even as I direct them right for her always manage to swirl going around her big heart. And then I get infected by an idea, which I cannot be cured of… I need a setting, a reason for her to be here, maybe just a friend who wants to hangout…to…watch a movie. Yeah, I’ll pick up something before work. And I think I have my old camera laying around somewhere here. Oh here it is, good. I get dressed and leave my house. I go to the closest video rental store and lounge around eyeing different movie cases down. I’m not exactly sure what I’m looking for, a romance film? Maybe that’s a bit too on the nose. What about horror? What’s this one? I speak quietly under my breath.

“Huh, that’s ironic”

This one’s both romance and horror. I twist it around to read the description. The core concept seems to be about how bad these two characters are at getting their love across, reminds me of someone. I decide to get it. I drive back home to drop the movie off and get dressed properly for work. I drive to work with abnormal levels of spark. She’s the first person visible upon entry, that has to be the primary reason why I’ve kept this dead end job for so long. The moment I lay my eyes on her everyday, I get charged to such an extent that no matter how much this job throws at me, I’m always able to handle it. She’s my battery, she’s my undying star, she’s my life’s source.

“Hi Carrie”

“Hii”

“How was your weekend?”

“Good, good, it was good”

“Nice, I’m happy to hear that”

“Yeah, what about you?”

“Mine was good as well”

“Nice”

“Hey so anyways I was wondering if you’re doing anything tonight?”

Soon after the movie concludes, we get up, we hug and I watch her leave. I close the door and sit back down on my couch, grabbing the camera and looking at the photo as I ponder to myself about that advertisement, what do they mean by “we can put you back into your old shoes”? How? With just a photograph? It’s probably dumb for me to assume that they are being direct, that they’re actually able to do what? Time travel? Are there any chances that their claim might just be real, I wonder? I really don’t know, but… if they are telling the truth why haven’t I heard about this before? Why is the only piece of media linking to them solely a short segment on a piece of paper with a lot of much larger segments on it. I slowly drift off to slumber land unable to successfully confront any of the questions bubbling on my mind’s surface, my eyes close for a while, then they open and I get on the road, on the way to the…memory…place. When I finally arrive at the address pinned to the bottom of that newspaper clipping, I find standing there a boring looking grey building. With zero distinctive marks or even windows. Just a single door right up front, I walk up to it and enter inside. Inside is a hallway with all of its sides including the ceiling and the floor coated in different mashes of different vibrant colors and shapes of all different sizes. I walk to the end of it and find a desk with a chair, a computer on it and a lady sitting at it.

“Hello?”

“What memory would you like to return to?”

I scramble to get the camera from my pocket, I turn it on and go to its gallery, go to one and only picture on the device. I turn the screen towards her.

“This one”

She puts her hand forward at me, gesturing for me to hand her the camera.

“Can I also have your name, gender and age”

“My name is Mark Donnelly, I’m male and twenty-nine years old”

As I speak, she starts typing.

“Okay, now I’m going to hand you a document where I need you to describe the memory inside this image in as much detail as you can. If you don’t know where to begin, I would suggest focusing on your feelings during the moment. Please try to keep the word amount above two hundred”

I take the document and sit down in front of her at the same desk. I pick up a pen and start.

“I know precisely all that I was feeling during this memory. That girl next to me is the love of my life. Being next to her the shell of me is intact, I am contained outside, but inside, inside there’s a live earthquake, a typhoon, there’s a tornado shaking me violently until my shell cracks and outpours the love I hide for her. I don’t know why I am here, I don’t know if this is real, but I have hope that it is, because I…I so desperately want to have the nerve, want to be honest, but I can’t be honest, because I constantly get plagued by a trail of thought, one which fills me with inescapable dread. The idea that there’s a chance for our love to be lopsided, that my side could be whole and hers flat, non-existent. I don’t want to risk alienating her. I do know why I am here, if everything you claim is possible, I’m hoping that confiding my love to her in there will give me the courage I lack out here""

I hand the document back. She starts her typing up again.

“How long would you like the memory to last for? Please also do note that the pricing is dependent on the duration”

The movie was about two hours, right?

“Can I do two hours?”

“Two hours, that comes out to 120 minutes which would equate to 120 dollars, but we always apply a fifty percent discount for first time users. The total comes out to 60 dollars”

“Thank you, please take a seat, I’ll notify you once everything’s prepared”

I sit at one of the seats located in the corner of the waiting room for a couple of minutes, until.

“They’re ready for you, feel free to go through that door”

I get up and walk over to the door she was pointing at. I open it and enter a dark room with just a singular spotlight right in the middle illuminating what appears to be a dentist chair. I walk towards it and lay on it, then a man comes through holding onto an IV pole. He rolls it next to me inserting the tubing into my vein. 

“Try to focus on the memory you’re going back to as much as you can and slowly close your eyes as I begin to count down. Ten… Nine… Eight… Five… Three… tw-”

**Perspective Switch**

I don’t know what it takes for a man to fully lose himself into a beast. Is there just a singular breaking point which you can tie everything back to or is it a myriad of things slowly getting built up in the background and ultimately culminating into the assembly of an inescapable room, room with no doors, room with just narrow unsqueezable windows, which you can only look through, look at the outside, look at where you once stood, look at the people you once were, but you can only look, you can never ever return there ever again. I find myself in the room. I don’t know what path I took to end up here, but I suppose that is of little importance, all that matters now is that I am in here, this is all my existence is now. To go in circles. I’m not a husband anymore, I’m not a writer anymore, I’m just a beast in a loose cage.

“Hey there, would you like a ride?”

“Oh, no…no thank you, my car is right over there”

“Okay… still I don’t mind giving you a ride”

“Thank you really, but I’m alright”

“Okay well, good night”

“Yeah… you too”

I think sometimes even the most rational people get some of the most irrational ideas, which they never actually follow through with, but what happens if you do? Where do you go after going through with the unthinkable? What do you become when all the conventions you’ve blindly been following your whole life crumble away as you drag a random girl along the pavement towards your car just by her hair as she pleads and screams?

“HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GET…GET AWAY FROM…HELP, SOMEBODY HELP ME, HELP…he-”

But your hearing is gone at that moment. You don’t hear her, you don’t hear the world, everything quiets down.

**Perspective Switch** 

“-ic. Darn, it took it”

Ever so familiar words slip from my mouth. I open my eyes, I’m in my house, on my couch, next to her. I twist my neck to look at my clock, it’s 7:13 PM. Right before we start watching the movie, what comes next? Right, I grab the camera for us to check the picture out. I twist my head back in the right place, leaning over the table to grab the camera, twisting its digital face to face us.

“I kinda like that actually, you know it’s a first attempt, nothing preplanned or exercised, it just has this level of realness to it”

I feel an ungraspable level of deja vu. I’ve been in this moment before. I reply to her, knowing exactly what I said, what I’m supposed to say.

“You’re right, it does have that authenticity to it. I think this is the one… and with that-”

I cut the script off early. I’m not here to retrace my steps. I put the camera back on the table and turn to her.

“Carrie, I need to tell you something”

“What’s up?”

I exhale.

“I… for the longest time… have been in love with you”

“W…What?”

“I don’t have a lot of courage, but I can’t keep my feelings just to me anymore”

“Uh…”

Her pauses make me fear the scenario I’ve expected to unravel. She doesn’t feel for me what I feel for her.

“I’m sorry, forget what I said, o-”

She leans in to kiss me, I kiss her back.

“I’ve been in love with you as well”

There begins to be waves of opposing feelings crushing violently at my inside walls. First came glee, euphoria, exhilaration. Second doubt, uncertainty, suspicion at the legitimacy. This is what I want, what I’ve been wanting for the longest time, but I just can’t allow myself to get fully immersed. She has her face, she has her eyes, her lips, her nose, her hair, her voice, her tenderness, but if this is my interpretation of the memory wouldn’t my mind just make her say just what I want to hear regardless or not if it’s what she wants me to hear from her. But, still this imitation, this lookalike is so flawless, I can’t help myself brush past all my disbeliefs and get fully coaxed by her. We alter my memory, we don’t watch the movie, she doesn’t leave my house, she doesn’t leave my arms. I am in complete serenity and then I get ripped from it just like that, my body isn’t in my house anymore, it’s in that dark room, on that dentist chair, I’m looking right ahead, there’s a girl standing there with a sign, which reads ‘You have 30 seconds left, once you return to your memory please close your eyes for a seamless reintegration’ and without skipping a beat I’m back at my house, back next to her body. I run my fingers through her hair one last time, I kiss her forehead one last time and with a smile close my eyes one last time. I feel the weight of her body dissipate, I feel the firmness which held my body vanish, I reopen my eyes, I’m back in the present. Everyone has left the room, instead there’s a new stand installed right in front of me, there’s my camera on it and a card with text inscribed on it: “Present and future are uncertain, only the past is set in stone. Why hope when you can be certain” I grab both of them and hastily exit through the building. I get in my car and drive to her place straight, definitely over the speed limit. I get there and get out of my vehicle. I look up and down her street and her car doesn’t seem to be anywhere, I walk up to her front door and knock, nothing, I get my cellphone out and call her, nothing, I call the office, nothing.

“She must be out, off the grid”

I get back into my car and try to contain my excitement. I’ve been pumped up on adrenaline ever since the second I reawakened. Which I was hoping to expel through confessing my love to Carrie, but she’s not there. Maybe this is good, it gives more time to put my thoughts in proper order, or maybe this prolonging will just make the doubts creep into me once more.

I went into work tomorrow, ready to see her face, as I peered into the front door. She’s not there. It’s unlike her to miss work. Maybe she’s sick? I try calling her, no answer. I don’t know who else to turn to, she’s a loner like me, no family, no friends. I drive by her house, still no car. Then came tomorrow and after tomorrow and after and after and after. No one batted an eye? Does no one care? Am I the only one who has noticed? I try to be rational, but the only phone line which comes to mind to contact is…

**Perspective Switch** 

“Did you get the timeline of events?”

“Yes, On June 5th he invited the missing person in question over to his house, she got to his house at around 8 o’clock, they would watch a movie together for the following 2 hours and afterwards she would leave, that’s the last time he would see her. Now this where it all gets strange, he put a great deal of importance on a certain detail, which is that right before they would begin watching the film, he would take a photograph of the two, he actually brought the camera with him, I have it right here. Now the reason as to why, that’s the actual strange part. He said that he took the photo so he could use it to travel back to that moment once again. A day before this gathering, he would come across an advert in a newspaper allegedly about a place which allows you to experience memories once again, as long as you provide them an image depicting the memory you want to revisit. The next day he would travel to that place and revisit that picture he took the night prior, after he came back…to the…past he would try to reach her, call her, go to her house, but to no avail, a couple of days would pass and she still wouldn’t reappear and that’s what brought him here today…oh and here, he gave me a card from that place, it’s got an address on it if you wanna check it out”

**Perspective Switch** 

A door opens. A door closes.

“Hey honey, where were you?”

Another door opens and closes.

What’s wrong? He’s been so distant and quiet lately. Did something happen? Why won’t he ever talk to me? I’ve been the closest person to him for well over two decades now, it’s just been me and him for so long. We’ve never had any kind of problems which has in turn shut him out from me to this extent. Is it the burnout you get from talking or looking at the same face for such an extended period. He used to always share everything with me, all of his feelings, all of his wants and desires, all of his writings, but now I don’t think he even enjoys writing anymore or that he desires anything anymore or that he feels anything anymore for anything, not for me, not for the world. It’s like he's all together an entirely different being now.

**Perspective Switch**

“Hello, I’m detective Reeves this is my partner Rogers”

“Hi, officers… what brings you here?”

“Greetings, we’re investigating a potential missing person’s case. This card is precisely what brings us here, it came from the last person who allegedly saw the missing person, we just wanted to match our timeline of events with yours”

“Of course, I’ll help in any way I can”

“Good… so could you check for us if there was a Mark Donnelly here on…just a second…the sixth of this month”

“...Yes a Mark Donnelly was here on that date”

“Is this him?”

“Yes”

“Is it also the picture he used for the…uh…”

“Yes, that is the memory he re-experienced""

“Could you explain the process for us? That is of the re-experiencing""

“We offer anyone for a small fee to be transported back to any memory of their choice, only requirement being a photograph of any one of their memories, but the revisiting can only work if the picture you supply us with actually contains you in it, if not that you’re at least connected to it somehow”

“I think we got that part, the outline of it all, but what does it mean to re-experience a memory exactly?”

“I see a lot of people here from all walks of life, all of them give the re-experiencings a different meaning. There’s a man who broke a woman’s heart, so he comes here now to see her again and again and many, many mores time, to see the version of her which hasn’t been hurt, version which never will get hurt, version which will never develop disdain, she’s a perfectly reserved snippet of happiness for him. There’s another man, a forgetful one, his journeys into the past are all for him to pay more attention, than he actually did living through them once. To see the aspects of his memories, he either has forgotten or missed on the first attempt living through them. We don’t offer a way for you to temper with the past in any way, all we offer and we offer everyone the exact same, is a chance for you to go through the exact locations, exact people, exact hours, exact colors again, the meaning you ask of, that’s for you to come up with, we’re just the conductor of a train with the only passenger on it being you and with us guiding you to the destination past""",3,1764523895.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

He ticks all the boxes: he's kind, caring, funny and there's a lot of sexual attraction and tension.

However, one small thing that has increasingly started to bother me is his relationship with his ex. For a bit of context, they met at university in first year and then they lived together in second year, where they started dating. From what I understand they dated for two years until fourth year, where, as a result of leaving uni, the distance made it difficult and it fizzled. There was no cheating or similar involved, but he was in love with her.

Given they lived together, their uni friendship group was the same (they all lived together in one house). This meant they met up quite a few times after uni, and went away as a group together and similar. When they were both still single (after breaking up), my boyfriend has told me they hooked up during group-meet ups (usually always drunk).

This year, after we started dating, my boyfriend started a postgraduate course for a year and, surprise, surprise, the ex is there too. This means that they see each other at least three or four times a week, and he tells me that they grab coffee together and have a catchup as friends.

I have met her in a group situation when my boyfriend introduced me to his group, and she was really lovely, and I didn't get any signs there was anything going on with them or like there was any ""unfinished business"".

Out of nosiness, I did read their messages (I know, I'm bad), and they do message quite frequently. Aside from a few jokes, which seem to be about group stuff I'm not aware of, they're mainly focused on uni talk and it seems very platonic.

This makes me think I'm overthinking it all and I'm overreacting; my boyfriend has given me no reason not to trust him and it's all perfect when we're together. He's been completely transparent with me about it as he didn't want it to come out and me be taken aback, which I feel is a green flag.

I also know that the ex is dating someone currently. However, I can't shake the feeling that hanging out with an ex with this much regularity is bound to cause something to stir up again.

Let’s talk about them. Because apparently the only thing job titles are really tied to is pay. HR doesn’t care what you actually do, they just slap ‘Coordinator’ or ‘Specialist’ on you so they can stick you in the cheap bin. Like, congrats, you’re now the *Coordinator of Breathing.* Please enjoy your $38,000 salary and a free stress ball.

Meanwhile, you’re out here managing budgets, leading teams, running projects across three states, and your title still makes you sound like you’re fetching coffee. Ten years of experience? Doesn’t matter. ATS sees ‘Coordinator’ and goes, *‘Next!’*

So you tailor your résumé. You call yourself ‘Program Manager’ because, shocker, that’s literally what you were doing. But then you get interviewed by someone born in 1952. You know the type, still thinks the ATS is a stack of punch cards and that LinkedIn is a dating site for accountants. They look at your résumé and go, *‘Back in my day, a Coordinator coordinated lunch orders, not statewide initiatives.’*

And the whole thing is a sick game. Recruiters invent these unicorn job descriptions, ‘We’re looking for a ninja rockstar thought leader who can juggle chainsaws while coding in Python.’ You get hired, six months later they’ve changed your role 500 times, and suddenly you’re doing manager‑level work with ‘Coordinator’ still stamped on your HR record. It’s like being promoted to *Wizard of Spreadsheets* internally, but the outside world only sees *Intern.*

I could start my own LLC tomorrow, slap ‘Founding Director’ on my business card, and nobody would blink. But if I put ‘Director’ on my résumé to reflect the scope of work I’ve actually done within my LLC, recruiters act like I’m trying to scam them. Titles are arbitrary names, but the wrong one gets you bitch‑slapped out of the hiring process before anyone even looks at your accomplishments.

Employers can call HR to ‘verify’ your title, but candidates can’t call former employees to verify what the job is actually like. Why is that fair?

The bullets under the title are what matter. The responsibilities are what matter. Titles are just capitalist gatekeeping tied to pay bands. And not all recruiters and hiring managers are like this, but to the ones who are: go fuck yourselves and your capitalist egos.

And here’s the mic drop: If titles mattered as much as you say they do, half of corporate America would still be called ‘Assistant to the Assistant.’ I can’t wait to escape this rat race.",4,1764523781.0,antiwork,1,1.0,False

Context: 

I’ve been posting a lot here in the past 24hrs after NEVER really posting because I’m facing the real deal right now. Thought I was more recovered than this but.. I guess not.

Boyfriend was feeling fine yesterday morning, ate breakfast and had coffee. Had a (normal) BM. An hour later, felt really nauseous. He was down and out with horrible chills, aches, craazy burps and tummy pain (poor guy) for about 3-4hrs and I kissed him and had lots of contact in this time. 

After that 3-4 hour period, he finally holed down in the basement where he pulled trig because he was fed up lol. Respect.

He then fell asleep and has been sleeping off and on until this morning. Today he feels better, if not a little crummy. But his guts still hurt and they’re “loud” apparently lol.

There has been no diarrhea, just the one yak. 

Now, questions:

1. I used the washroom after his normal BM in the morning and did a veerrry lazy handwashing. I’m incredibly vigilant about handwashing but home has always been “safe” and I never felt the need to go crazy with handwashing while sharing a bathroom with my partner (OOPS.) 

2. I know that I wouldn’t have caught anything by kissing him while he wasn’t feeling well BEFORE the ralph, but I worry somehow in all my contact with him while he wasn’t feeling good, I got it. Like, he’s very good with washing his hands but what if he showered and washed his ass or something?? this is ridiculous 😭

I know that people can shed small amounts of the virus before symptom onset. Do you think I’ll be OK for using the bathroom once after his normal BM?

3. So when everyone says you should wait 24-48hrs after the LAST symptoms, does that mean his one and only puke? Or do the last symptoms include his tummy hurting/gurgling this morning? Like, what do you mEaN by “LAST” symptoms when the stomach pain and gurgling this morning could be symptoms but could also just be a body recovering? :/

4. Let’s say he showers completely with hot water and soap (gotta carpet wash the guy 😭) and washes his hands UBER thoroughly. I won’t let him kiss me/share utensils/have him make food. Is he technically .. safe? Like, if his whole body is completely clean from any ralph particle ..?

Obviously, the robustness of the bug terrifies me. I know he’ll still be pooping it out for a good while and if he has one semi-weak handwash after a BM.. well, there goes every safe light switch and door handle. I’ve heard of people contracting this thing after ten days of zero sickness in the household. 

I’ve been bleaching like a mfer but knowing he’s still a bit of a virus bomb kills me :(

I just wanna know when he can come out of the basement and sleep in my bed with me. Even with consistent bleaching and handwashing on my end for a few weeks .. just, when can I move from FULL QUARANTINE LOCKDOWN 🚨 to like .. level 5 precautions?

I miss him so bad and I so desperately want to see him and hold him and not have him locked in the basement. I wanna go back to normal :(

This is all on top of the fact that I feel really, really doomed right now. I’ll say it again, I think I’m already cooked here. But .. I just really miss him. Small part of me (TINY PART) kinda wishes I get a mild version already so I can just go down and hug him.

Title: A Wallet Full of Stars

Chapter 1: The Weight of Safety

The rain had been falling softly all evening, turning the balcony floor into a mirror of the sky.  
Priya stood at the railing, barefoot, her pale yellow dupatta clinging to her shoulders like a frightened bird.  
She had rehearsed the words a hundred times in her room, but when she finally stepped in front of her father, they came out small and trembling.

“Papa… I need to tell you something very important.”  
She swallowed. “I… I have fallen in love.”  
A pause, then, softer than the rain:  
“His name is Arjun. He runs a tiny café by the lake—the one with the fairy lights. I love him, Papa. Truly.”

Paresh Mehta was sitting in his old cane chair, the one his wife used to love.  
The teacup in his hand stopped halfway to his lips.  
For a long moment only the sound of raindrops on the mango leaves filled the silence.

Then he placed the cup down with deliberate care and opened his arms.

“Come here, meri gudiya.”

Priya went to him like a child again, kneeling on the floor and resting her head on his knee.  
He stroked her wet hair the way he had done when she was five and afraid of thunder.

“Tell Papa everything,” he said gently.

So she did.  
She spoke of late evenings when the café smelled of filter coffee and cinnamon, of Arjun reading poetry aloud to children on Saturdays, of the way he remembered every regular’s name and their favourite song, of how he once stayed open past midnight because an old man had missed his bus and had nowhere to go.

Paresh listened without interrupting, but his eyes grew heavier with every word.

When she finished, the rain had slowed to a whisper.

He lifted her chin so she had to look at him.

“Meri princess,” he began, voice thick with love and fear, “what you are feeling is the most beautiful thing in the world.  
But love is also a cruel teacher.  
It shows you the sky and then asks you to live without food, without medicine, without dignity when the money runs out.  
I have seen it happen—good boys, honest boys, but the wife still counting coins at the end of the month, the child still waiting for school fees.”

He took both her hands in his rough, builder’s palms.

“I promised your Mummy the night she left us.  
She was so weak she could barely speak, but she made me swear on her mangalsutra:  
‘Paresh… keep our gudiya safe first… then happy.’  
I have never forgotten those words. They are carved here.”  
He touched his chest. “Karan Malhotra’s family builds half the skyline. With him you will never know what it is to look at a price tag and turn away. You will never know fear.  
Safety is the first gift a father must give his princess. Happiness… happiness grows only when the roots are safe.”

Priya’s tears fell onto his knees, warm and unstoppable.

“But Papa… my heart—”

“Your heart is young,” he said softly, wiping her cheeks with his thumbs. “It will heal.  
I am old. I have seen hearts break and homes break. Homes break harder.”

He pulled her into his lap the way he used to when she was small, rocking her gently.

“One day, meri gudiya, you will thank your Papa for being cruel today.  
I am not taking your happiness away. I am keeping it safe until it can live without fear.”

Priya buried her face in his shirt.  
“Yes, Papa,” she whispered, the words tasting like surrender.

She stood up, touched his feet with trembling fingers, and walked back into the house.  
Her wet footprints on the marble dried within minutes, as though the house and sky both wanted to pretend the tears had never fallen.

Paresh stayed on the balcony long after she left, staring at the rain, repeating his wife’s last words like a mantra he was no longer sure he understood.

Safe first… then happy.  
Safe first… then happy.

But in the quiet, another question began to grow, small and dangerous:

What if the two were not the same thing at all?

Long story short, I went to a computer shop to buy a new SSD for my laptop (which is very precious to me and I am very careful with it even in the minor details) ... I wanted the SSD installation to be done immediately in front of me but the boy said I needed 2 hours or so until the other guy arrives to look for the shop while he goes upstairs to perform the installation, and that I can just leave the laptop and wait in a nearby coffee shop, since the shop looks nice and it has good rating on google I decided to trust him and wait for 30min then go back see if we can proceed or just take my laptop elsewhere. When I came back, voilà : The SSD was installed and all but the incompetent m*** .. (sorry) .. didn't take out the sd card and the sim tray before opening nor closing back the laptops chasis ... which resulted in their slots being busted and the sim tray deformed, now neither of them would get inserted normally in their slots.
I tried to keep calm, the manager came but he started stalling and asked me to leave the laptop for repair and it was an unfortunate ""accident"", which I didn't because tbh I completely lost trust in them, and also because breaking someone's stuff by forcing it open without checking first why it's not willing to be opened easily from a specific side isn't an accident, it's sheer incompetence.
So I got out and took it to another trusted computer shop where a technician whom I already know is very capable and professional. Anyway, they didn't offer a reduction or compensation or anything and now I gotta pay for the repair of my shi* (which WAS perfectly fine before) though I just paid 600Dh+ for the SSD. All the offered was ""The police station is at the end of the street, we are sorry"" :)
So now I gotta wait for 2-3 days to get back my laptop that I necessarily need everyday. Meanwhile I'm feeling very sad and injustice because when you take care of your machine, seeing someone treat it recklessly then trying to stall u feels like a violation. 💔",7,1764523475.0,Morocco,10,1.0,False

*Where Girona’s Survival Hopes Meet Real Madrid’s ""We’re Just Here for the Free Snacks"" Attitude*

---

### Parse the Odds: The Math of Desperation vs. Dominance

Let’s crunch the numbers like a Girona fan cringing through a last-minute own goal. Real Madrid is a **1.4 favorite** (-714 implied probability) across bookmakers, while Girona sits at **6.0-6.75** (14-16% implied). The draw? A 5.0-5.4 shot (18-20%), which feels about right for a team (Girona) that’s mastered the art of *almost* pulling off miracles.

The spread favors Real Madrid **-1.25** at 1.85-1.87, and the total goals line is **3.5** (Over: 1.91-2.02, Under: 1.77-1.88). Historically, Real Madrid’s attack has been a firehose (they scored 4 on Olympiacos last week), while Girona’s defense is a sieve with a *“Sorry, we’re out of coffee”* sign hanging in the net.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Motivation, and Why Girona Needs a Miracle

Real Madrid enters this clash riding a **4-3 Champions League win** over Olympiacos—a game where they looked like a toddler with a chocolate fountain: messy, overwhelming, and occasionally self-sabotaging. They’re one point ahead of Barcelona in the league, so Xabi Alonso’s squad is playing like a chess grandmaster who just learned the game but *really* wants to prove they’re not bad at checkers too.

Girona, meanwhile, is 18th in La Liga, clinging to the relegation zone like a toddler to a security blanket. Their recent 1-1 draw with Real Betis was a small victory, but it’s the kind of result that makes you wonder if they won by accident or because Betis’ striker forgot how to tie his shoes. Manager Míchel Sánchez will need a performance from his team akin to a squirrel building a skyscraper out of acorns: improbable, chaotic, and destined to collapse.

### Humorous Spin: Football as a Reality TV Show

1panszz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1panszz/my_friend_is_starting_to_scare_me/,My friend is starting to scare me.,"I'm genuinely concerned about a friend of mine. We're 15 years apart she is older (I’m 27f and she’s 42f) . When we met i was also in a rough place mentally. That’s not the case anymore as I’ve worked on everything i was concerned about (mental health, weight) she’s very negative and always has something to say about others. She claims to have a therapist/medicated yet her actions speak different. Anyways, Now im making new friends ! She got REAL mad about that! So when I expressed to her that im uncomfortable with how she gets upset that I have other friends, She told me she questions her worth as a person now. ALL because i got coffee with someone not her. In the past has mentioned i make her feel human, im the reason she feels like trying everyday.. She's a wife and mother..and tells me that I MAKE her feel like a person, not her family. I'm the reason she matters. It's scaring me. After telling her how i feel she didn't reply. Our entire friendship is her trauma dumping and me just listening (therapist friend). She seems to get excited if my life has something negative happen and begs me to explain in detail.We will literally be at an event for our kids and she enjoys talking shit about her husband/others putting me in an awkward place. Always so inappropriate and bad timing. Other people stare. Will ask me if my partner does the same, I'll say no and she’ll look disappointed . She seems to WANT me to be in a bad relationship. Suggested we leave our guys to move in together. I'm happily married..is she secretly in love with me or something ?? Complains about her appearance but makes zero effort always looking for reassurance. I'm so drained. I’ve never been friends with someone older because i thought something has to be wrong with them to have zero friends/social life at that age if career isn’t a factor. we shouldn’t have anything to relate on as I’m still starting out in life. And we DONT now that i think about it. We met via our kids activities not organically in a social setting. I think i felt sorry for her for such a long time that i forced myself to continue being around her. I often cry leaving out “hangouts” from how bad her venting makes me feel. She made me feel responsible for her happiness. How do i go about this ? Never dealt with something like this before. She also has a lot of weapons (America..) so im scared cutting her off is going to make her do something based off emotion??? Not sure how to navigate. Plus she followed me to every single activity my kids do! Signed her children up to surprise me! Do i change the classes? Any advice/help is appreciated.

1pans1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pans1m/aio_is_my_extrovert_bf_too_extreme/,AIO: is my extrovert bf too extreme?,"TLDR: can’t decide if I’m asking for too much compromise from my extrovert bf by wanting him to choose to stay home at times or generally respect my quiet time just like I choose to go with him to social events and deal with noise. 

So I am a 34F introvert (mixed with a bit of extrovert) and my boyfriend of 2 years is 37M super extrovert. We’ve lived together for a while now and thinking of marriage and kids etc.

The one thing that I find concerning is how different we are with our recharging. He loves talking to people 24/7 (on the phone with his brothers, dad, meeting friends, going out, work trips, dinners, you name it) he will NEVER say no to an invite. I admit most are superficial and lack depth but it’s more “something to do” for him. Sometimes I wonder if he’s avoiding being alone with this thoughts tbh (he also needs to always be listening to a podcast, YouTube, music, watching something etc.) it’s a lot of stimuli in my opinion. For example right now it’s 8am and he’s been watching the f1 race on the tv, has an iPad on watching a stream of it, is on the phone with his dad commenting on it real time. This happens every race weekend and he watches Friday and Saturday pre races too. This is also my weekend to relax and I feel like it’s taken over by him and his loud hobbies. My only other option is to go back upstairs to the bedroom but it feels restrictive to me to always need to cower away and spend the next 3 hours in the bedroom? I want to enjoy my living room as well. 

Me, on the other hand, I have a small group of friends and value deeper relationships and don’t need to see my friends that often (and they’re the same). I also like some quiet time around the house and generally am ok with my own company. If I have a weekend with no plans, I don’t seek it out but I may see friends if I’m especially bored. But don’t NEED to have constant communication. 

His family is also a bit emeshed so even during the days we have no plans at home, he is on the phone with them multiple times a day and sometimes our time together gets interrupted by them. It drives me crazy to constantly listen to his phone calls (always about nothing important-just banter). I try to protect some of my quit time especially first thing in the morning before I’ve even had my coffee and it’s a hit or miss if he honors that. It helps my nervous system to ease into my day vs. an immediate influx of noise. I don’t want to restrict his natural urge to talk but I also know that it negatively affects me if I’m constantly hearing someone chatter on the phone including 8am on a Saturday. Sometimes he takes the calls when we’re in the middle of stuff too like dinner or playing a board game or watching a movie. basically even our quality time feels disturbed. 

My question is: I tend to suck it up and try to attend events/places with him as much as I can and generally do fine but I loooove my cozy couch nights so much. However, it feels like he can’t compromise by also giving me some nights in where I can enjoy my boyfriend 1:1 on the couch as he can’t sit still. I uunderstand letting him go without me but I’m talking about 1:1 time. What good is a relationship if we just do our own thing all the time? And if I don’t go out with him, then my alternative is not spending time with him. I have friends and hobbies but I actually ENJOY being with my SO.

Our typical week for context: I’d say Monday through Thursday we are at home in the evenings. Not quality time but more just routine of dinner and Netflix and we fall asleep early (like 9pm cuz we’re both tired). Occasionally he will have a work dinner or his family may invite us over for dinner (his family and I don’t get along that much so for me this is draining and fake). So if I want to have a dinner with him- I either go or he goes alone. He never compromises and chooses to stay home with me. I think this is the part that hurts because there’s no balance of him ever choosing to stay home with me. To him- we spend enough time during the week just existing and living together and he seems to need a fill from many many people. It’s like he cycles through people but only gives a bit to each person (including me). I don’t fee prioritized or like I get a bigger slice of the pie. Is this what extroverts do? 
The weekends he generally wants to do something every day. Whether it’s golf, go to his parents house, see friends etc. and when I ask for a night in- it’s usually met with “sure if nothing else is going on”. So it makes me feel like unless I have a specific calendar event for him, just a movie night on the couch is not guaranteed. And my time with him is only if there’s nothing better to pick from which makes me feel like I am not a choice but a backup plan. 

So…what’s a reasonable amount of time we should spend together vs. apart? Am I asking for too much? Is it normal to expect some compromise from his end to stay in sometimes as I also try to go out more? Or is that not fair to ask? Just feels like I rarely get quality time with him especially 1:1.",5,1764523253.0,AmIOverreacting,16,0.86,False

1panquc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1panquc/aita_for_accidentally_causing_my_best_friend_and/,AITA for accidentally causing my best friend and his girlfriend to break up?,"For context, I 23M have known my best friend for over 10 years and his girlfriend for about 8. They started dating 5 years ago but have had 1-2 breaks in between (our friends don’t have the best opinion of her).

Fast forward to a few days ago on Black Friday. Every year my friends and I wake up early and drive to shops near where we live to capitalize on the deals and buy new clothes. This year however a few of my friends couldn’t go and I ended up being part of a group consisting of my best friend, his sister and his girlfriend. I get picked up and we go to Dunkin’ Donuts to get coffee and food before picking up one of my other friends who overslept and going to the shopping outlets.

Here’s where it goes downhill. While in the drive through, my friend’s sister mentions the movie wicked and how the cast is kinda weird. I agree and say “yeah I find Ariana grande and the other one pretty annoying based on the interviews I’ve seen online”. To me this was a pretty normal statement but then my friend’s girlfriend just straight up tells me that I am racist for calling the other actor “the other one”. I’m just laughing at first because I have no idea what the actors name is so it felt normal to say “the other one”. I tell the girlfriend that it has nothing to do with race as I would say “the other guy, one or girl” when bunching someone I didn’t know in with a massively famous celebrity. This didn’t go down well with her and she starts raising her voice and saying that this other actor is almost just as famous as Ariana grande and it is clearly racist to say what I said. 

We leave the drive through and this argument continues while my best friend and his sister are just sitting in the front seat not saying much. I admit that I should’ve probably tried to de-escalate the situation but being called racist was something that angered me so I wasn’t thinking clearly in the moment and was set on trying to defend myself.

We are heading towards my other friend’s house and that’s when I ask my friend to drop me off back home as I am really annoyed and don’t really feeling like going to the outlets anymore. As soon as I ask him, his girlfriend immediately demands him to drive her home not me. I just start laughing because this whole situation is ridiculous and she continues to accuse me of being racist for making this comment. We then eventually get to my other friend’s house and are waiting in the driveway for him to get in the car and at this point the girlfriend is screaming at me and on the verge of tears. She tells my best friend “this is why I hate your f-ing friends” and 
other insults to people that aren’t even there. At this point my friend tells me to stop talking and I should’ve but in the moment, getting called racist and having my best friend take her side I got really mad and told him to shut the f up. This set the girlfriend off even more and she starts screaming at me and trying to open the parked car door to leave. Eventually she gets out and just bolts down the street. This is when my friend’s sister suggests we should get out of the car and go to my other friend’s porch to wait there. My best friend then takes the car and goes through our town to pick up the girlfriend.

Me, the sister and my other friend did end up still going to the outlets. And after a few hours passed the sister lets us know that the girlfriend had just broken up with my best friend (her brother).

I know there are definitely things that I could’ve done differently in the moment but I felt personally attacked and felt the need to defend my character. I have since hung out with my best friend and there doesn’t seem to be much bad blood as he said that something like this had been building up.

The libraries were meh to me, and my high school habits ruined my productivity at home. As I ventured from coffee shop to coffee shop, I became increasingly particular about the things I was looking for in terms of vibe. I've rated each on a scale from 1-5.

1. **Comfy Seats** \- my rear end is not the most padded, so I needed somewhere I could sit for long periods of time without feeling like I was developing an ulcer
2. **Natural light** \- really every coffee shop in Tulsa has windows, but some have more than others
3. **Accessibility of outlets** \- if I'm going to be somewhere for hours at a time, I need outlets. Ideally I don't want my cords traversing walkways and causing tripping hazards, or having to invade someone's space in order to charge my electronics
4. **Parking** \- popularity of coffee shops in the city and its correlation to good parking is not great at times. I try to come at times when I know parking will be more available
5. **Baristas** \- likely my most controversial aspect of my ratings. But I feel like friendly baristas can hugely impact whether I feel comfortable at a shop or not. (attractiveness of baristas is also a factor but not a factor in this post lol)
6. **Quality/number of study space** \- as a student I need space to spread out and I want to know there will be a space for me to study when I get there
7. **Hours** \- ideally I'd like a shop that opens early and stays open late

Disclaimer: I enjoy coffee but am in no way a coffee connoisseur. This list is purely based on my subjective view on the ""study-ability"" of the coffee shops. I've been to each list on this shop at least twice and I also haven't been to every shop (Phinesso, Jenks Coffee Co, Foolish Things, Nordaggios to name a few), so let me know what you think I missed. I frequent more than others, so the list is biased (obviously).

1pankza,https://www.reddit.com/r/EcommerceWebsite/comments/1pankza/does_anyone_here_upsell_in_cart_page_successfully/,Does anyone here upsell in cart page successfully on Shopify?,"I’ve noticed a pattern across a lot of Shopify stores I check out, especially smaller brands.

Product pages are stacked with optimisations and upsells, cart drawers are widely used with and without upsells… but the **classic cart page** very often seems likean afterthought.

Yes, more shops now use drawers instead of the full cart, and some try to hide the cart page completely, but in most stores it’s still accessible (at least on shopify), and it’s mostly  a ghost town, and feels like a missed surface.

IMO A simple add-on there could go a long way over time, eg:

* A basic upsell like gift wrap, priority packing or so
* A small accessory that clearly pairs with what’s already in cart (cleaner, refills, matching item, coffee + chocolate, etc etc)

If the offer is targeted and relevant, it should feel like a helpful option?

If there is an upsell in cart page on some stores, it’s usually very generic, static upsell carousel or “recently viewed” items or so, which I don’t believe convert that well.

If you an online retailer (or work with eComm brands in consulting/marketing space), I’m curious:

* Do you actually treat it as a serious upsell surface?
* Or is everything happening in the cart drawer and on PDPs and ignore the cart page?

I'm not too familiar with WooCommerce and other ecomm shop infra, but I imagine it would be the same there too.

Long story short, I went to a computer shop to buy a new SSD for my laptop (which is very precious to me and I am very careful with it even in the minor details) ... I wanted the SSD installation to be done immediately in front of me but the guy said he needed some time since the manager isn't present yet to look for the shop while he goes upstairs to perform the installation, and that I can just leave the laptop and wait in a nearby coffee shop, since the shop looks nice and it has good rating on google I decided to trust him, waited for 40 min then came back and voilà : The SSD was installed and all but the incompetent m*** .. (sorry) .. didn't take out the sd card and the sim tray before opening the laptops chasis nor before closing it back ... which resulted in their slots being busted and the sim tray deformed, now neither of them would get inserted normally in their slots.
I tried to keep calm, the manager came but he started stalling and asked me to leave the laptop for repair, which I didn't because tbh I completely lost trust in them so I said I will take it to another trusted computer shop where technician whom I already know is very capable and professional. Anyway, they didn't offer a payment or compensation or something and now I gotta pay for the repair of my shi* (which WAS perfectly fine before) though I just paid 70$+ for the SSD :)
So now I gotta wait for 2 days to get my laptop that I necessarily need everyday. Meanwhile I'm feeling very sad and injustice because when you take care of your machine, seeing someone treat it recklessly feels like a violation. 💔",14,1764522649.0,thinkpad,5,0.79,False

1panhlo,/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1pa4wfx/my_idea_for_dispatch_season_two_episode_five/,"My Idea For Dispatch: Season Two, Episode Five","This is a continuation of my other posts based on creating ideas for Dispatch: Season Two, episodes one, two, three and four. Please go check them out for context with this one and let me know what you think.

Episode Five:

We are in the meeting room and Robert is explaining the punishment he and Z-Team are facing after yet another situation where members of this team were taken, they investigated the matter themselves without the permitted authority, were also taken and needed saving outside of shift patterns and without following protocol. Clearly Z-Team can't be trusted to not make a big mess even on the night shift, so they will be working as support for Mandy's Angels. When they go fight kaijus, save buildings and save the city, your team saves cats from trees, fetches people coffee and even have to babysit.

Mandy's Angels are following the rules and starting to work together. The new boss sees them as a shining light of what he wants the Phoenix Program to be, whereas the Z-Team are arresting mob bosses and stopping ancient gods but are being reckless and irresponsible. The whole team is at risk of being cut, if we don't sort ourselves out. Robert asks the team to do their very best for their shift today and they all leave to prepare.

Well, all except Flambae and Prism, who remind Robert they have the day off today. Booked as holiday, so that they could go compete in a locally televised talent show called 'The Walk Of Shame'. Each show has five contestants who go on stage, perform for three judges and they decide if they qualify for the final round or are shamed and eliminated. After that, the audience at home decide who wins the show and takes home $100,000.

Robert has a choice. He can either wish them luck and let them know to contact him if they need anything. He can either request for them to stay because the team needs them right now. He can say he doesn't care and they can do what they want. Every choice ends with them still going but they will remember how Robert felt about them leaving.

During your shift, you start to get readings of a device similar to the freeze ray and heat ray somewhere in the city. This device can manipulate electronics and is very powerful. It starts to cause blackouts across the city and is putting a lot of people in danger. You are able to find the source is coming from the same building 'The Walk Of Shame' is being filmed. It turns out one of the other contestants Flambae and Prism are competing against is the same woman who bribed the judges to win a talent show, which caused Prism to react and was the cause of her powers to appear. Prism believes this woman got her hands on the device somehow and is using this powerful electronic tech to win another competition against her.

As you continue your shift, your screen is hacked and you can see 'The Walk Of Shame' being played, it is being shown on every screen in the city due to this device. This girl sings and is talented, so she goes through with the judges vote. The next person is a dancer and the technology around him starts to play up. Spotlights appear where he is not, the music starts to sound off and finally he is blasted in the face with a smoke machine and the judges shame his performance and kick him out. A stunt woman comes out next and starts up a couple of chainsaws but the technology causes them to stop working before she can start to juggle them. Lighting starts falling from the ceiling and one even hits her head, a medical team takes her away.

As Flambae enters the stage, he begins a stand-up routine. Robert hacks in (these next two hacks are the hardest hacks you will ever have to complete in a Dispatch game.) Flambae has three health bars, if you take too long or hit the wrong codes, he loses a life and there are sounds being played to embarrass him and put him off. If all of his health goes, the judges eliminate him from the competition and he blames you for not helping more.

As Prism enters the stage, she begins to sing about the woman who is cheating to win. Treating this moment like a roast to expose her and destroy her at the same time. The same type of complicated hacking task occurs but, if you fail, her performance is hampered by the screens going black and white, so the audience can't see Prism at her very best. The judges will put her through regardless but you need to succeed in order for Prism to win and have you to thank for it.

The woman wants to end Prism right here and now. She assembles technology from the studio to form robot type beings. Flambae has Prism's back and Robert goes to suit up as Mecha-Man.

1panh8y,/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1pa4wfx/my_idea_for_dispatch_season_two_episode_five/,"My Idea For Dispatch: Season Two, Episode Five","This is a continuation of my other posts based on creating ideas for Dispatch: Season Two, episodes one, two, three and four. Please go check them out for context with this one and let me know what you think.

Episode Five:

We are in the meeting room and Robert is explaining the punishment he and Z-Team are facing after yet another situation where members of this team were taken, they investigated the matter themselves without the permitted authority, were also taken and needed saving outside of shift patterns and without following protocol. Clearly Z-Team can't be trusted to not make a big mess even on the night shift, so they will be working as support for Mandy's Angels. When they go fight kaijus, save buildings and save the city, your team saves cats from trees, fetches people coffee and even have to babysit.

Mandy's Angels are following the rules and starting to work together. The new boss sees them as a shining light of what he wants the Phoenix Program to be, whereas the Z-Team are arresting mob bosses and stopping ancient gods but are being reckless and irresponsible. The whole team is at risk of being cut, if we don't sort ourselves out. Robert asks the team to do their very best for their shift today and they all leave to prepare.

Well, all except Flambae and Prism, who remind Robert they have the day off today. Booked as holiday, so that they could go compete in a locally televised talent show called 'The Walk Of Shame'. Each show has five contestants who go on stage, perform for three judges and they decide if they qualify for the final round or are shamed and eliminated. After that, the audience at home decide who wins the show and takes home $100,000.

Robert has a choice. He can either wish them luck and let them know to contact him if they need anything. He can either request for them to stay because the team needs them right now. He can say he doesn't care and they can do what they want. Every choice ends with them still going but they will remember how Robert felt about them leaving.

During your shift, you start to get readings of a device similar to the freeze ray and heat ray somewhere in the city. This device can manipulate electronics and is very powerful. It starts to cause blackouts across the city and is putting a lot of people in danger. You are able to find the source is coming from the same building 'The Walk Of Shame' is being filmed. It turns out one of the other contestants Flambae and Prism are competing against is the same woman who bribed the judges to win a talent show, which caused Prism to react and was the cause of her powers to appear. Prism believes this woman got her hands on the device somehow and is using this powerful electronic tech to win another competition against her.

As you continue your shift, your screen is hacked and you can see 'The Walk Of Shame' being played, it is being shown on every screen in the city due to this device. This girl sings and is talented, so she goes through with the judges vote. The next person is a dancer and the technology around him starts to play up. Spotlights appear where he is not, the music starts to sound off and finally he is blasted in the face with a smoke machine and the judges shame his performance and kick him out. A stunt woman comes out next and starts up a couple of chainsaws but the technology causes them to stop working before she can start to juggle them. Lighting starts falling from the ceiling and one even hits her head, a medical team takes her away.

As Flambae enters the stage, he begins a stand-up routine. Robert hacks in (these next two hacks are the hardest hacks you will ever have to complete in a Dispatch game.) Flambae has three health bars, if you take too long or hit the wrong codes, he loses a life and there are sounds being played to embarrass him and put him off. If all of his health goes, the judges eliminate him from the competition and he blames you for not helping more.

As Prism enters the stage, she begins to sing about the woman who is cheating to win. Treating this moment like a roast to expose her and destroy her at the same time. The same type of complicated hacking task occurs but, if you fail, her performance is hampered by the screens going black and white, so the audience can't see Prism at her very best. The judges will put her through regardless but you need to succeed in order for Prism to win and have you to thank for it.

The woman wants to end Prism right here and now. She assembles technology from the studio to form robot type beings. Flambae has Prism's back and Robert goes to suit up as Mecha-Man. Royd stops Robert though, saying the suit is too damaged from the demon fight and you don't want a villain who can control technology to have access to Mecha-Man. Robert worries about getting there in time but realises the studio is just across the street. Your new boss stops you from leaving and orders you to stand down. Robert's shift is over and he should leave this to Mandy's Angels, who will take their time, come up with a plan and do the right thing.

1panfeb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1panfeb,!HELP ME OUT! I'm addicted to Ebony Wood by Zara- give me new medicine,"Hey everyone
I’m trying to describe the fragrance profile of Zara Ebony Wood so that you perfume-savvy people can help me find other scents with a similar “vibe.” The price doesn't matter I just desperately want to smell like this but ✨more intense✨ because this one dissipates after 5-6 hours. Here’s how I’d describe it:


Overall vibe:unisex, refined, sort of like a clean, expensive-shop perfume — elegant, subtle but noticeable, not flashy. According to reviews the main sensations are “soft spicy,” “musky,” “woody,” “aromatic,” with a bit of “citrus” and “sweetness.” 

Top (opening) notes: Pink pepper, grapefruit, cypress — this gives a fresh, slightly spicy-peppery and a little citrusy/aromatic opening.

Middle (heart): Coffee — which (to me) may contribute to a kind of soft warmth and depth; a cozy, slightly roasted aromatic impression before the dry-down.

Base notes / dry-down: Vetiver and patchouli — these create the woody, musky, slightly earthy foundation, giving a subtle woody-musky softness that feels natural yet “expensive.”

Character / feel: Softly spicy and aromatic at first, evolving into a woody–musky dry-down. It’s unisex, versatile (some say slightly masculine leaning, others find it balanced), and overall the scent feels warm, elegant, and “clean,” like the kind of perfume you might smell in a boutique or a nice spa — but still accessible. Many reviewers say it “smells expensive.”

---

If any of you know other perfumes — regardless of price — that smell similar to this (i.e. clean/spicy/woody/unisex, with that “expensive boutique store” vibe), I’d love your suggestions.

1panexf,https://www.reddit.com/r/extroverts/comments/1panexf/introvertextrovert_relationship_balance/,Introvert/extrovert relationship balance?,"So I am a 34F introvert (mixed with a bit of extrovert) and my boyfriend of 2 years is 37M super extrovert. We’ve lived together for a while now and thinking of marriage and kids etc.

The one thing that I find concerning is how different we are with our recharging. He loves talking to people 24/7 (on the phone with his brothers, dad, meeting friends, going out, work trips, dinners, you name it) he will NEVER say no to an invite. I admit most are superficial and lack depth but it’s more “something to do” for him.

Me, on the other hand, I have a small group of friends and value deeper relationships and don’t need to see my friends that often (and they’re the same).

His family is also a bit emeshed so even during the days we have no plans at home, he is on the phone with them multiple times a day and sometimes our time together gets interrupted by them. It drives me crazy to constantly listen to his phone calls (always about nothing important-just banter). I try to protect some of my quit time especially first thing in the morning before I’ve even had my coffee and it’s a hit or miss if he honors that. I don’t want to restrict his natural urge to talk but I also know that it negatively affects me if I’m constantly hearing someone chatter on the phone including 8am on a Saturday. 

My question is: I tend to suck it up and try to attend events/places with him as much as I can and generally do fine but I loooove my cozy couch nights so much. However, it feels like he can’t compromise by also giving me some nights in where I can enjoy my boyfriend 1:1 on the couch as he can’t sit still. I uunderstand letting him go without me but I’m talking about 1:1 time. What good is a relationship if we just do our own thing all the time? And if I don’t go out with him, then my alternative is not spending time with him. I have friends and hobbies but I actually ENJOY being with my SO.

Our typical week for context: I’d say Monday through Thursday we are at home in the evenings. Not quality time but more just routine of dinner and Netflix and we fall asleep early (like 9pm cuz we’re both tired). Occasionally he will have a work dinner or his family may invite us over for dinner (his family and I don’t get along that much so for me this is draining and fake). So if I want to have a dinner with him- I either go or he goes alone. He never compromises and chooses to stay home with me. I think this is the part that hurts because there’s no balance of him ever choosing to stay home with me. To him- we spend enough time during the week just existing and living together and he seems to need a fill from many many people. It’s like he cycles through people but only gives a bit to each person (including me). I don’t fee prioritized or like I get a bigger slice of the pie. Is this what extroverts do? 
The weekends he generally wants to do something every day. Whether it’s golf, go to his parents house, see friends etc. and when I ask for a night in- it’s usually met with “sure if nothing else is going on”. So it makes me feel like unless I have a specific calendar event for him, just a movie night on the couch is not guaranteed. And my time with him is only if there’s nothing better to pick from which makes me feel like I am not a choice but a backup plan. 

So…what’s a reasonable amount of time we should spend together vs. apart? Am I asking for too much? Is it normal to expect some compromise from his end to stay in sometimes as I also try to go out more? Or is that not fair to ask? Just feels like I rarely get quality time with him especially 1:1.",0,1764522395.0,extroverts,0,0.5,False

1pand74,https://archive.ph/Sn3ow,Trump Wines Sold At Coast Guard Stores On Federal Property,"Coast Guard Exchanges at its headquarters in Washington, D.C., and in Centreville, Virginia, recently stocked Trump-branded wine and cider, according to a photo posted on Instagram and confirmed by Forbes from calls to the stores.

Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin confirmed the exchanges were carrying Trump wines in a statement to Forbes, saying, “The brave men and women of the USCG are pleased to be able to buy Trump wine and cider tax free.”

While there’s been no shortage of Trump’s businesses capitalizing on the presidency—from using the presidential seal on golf markers at his courses to selling a $75 coffee table book showcasing pictures by his official White House photographer—these wines are among the few times Trump products have been sold at a government facility.

The White House referred inquiries to the Coast Guard and Department of Homeland Security, the Coast Guard deferred to DHS and the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.

“This is one of those things where there probably isn’t any legal issue, but there is an optics and an ethics issue,” said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesperson for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog. He noted that whether the sales violate the Constitution’s domestic emoluments clause—which prohibits presidents from receiving government benefits beyond their salary—depends on how the wine is purchased. The president and vice president are exempt from most federal conflict-of-interest laws.

“You don’t want to see the military essentially playing sides,” Libowitz told Forbes. “Are they going to try to make money for other presidents? It’s a weird thing.”

Any restraint Trump showed in profiting off the presidency during his first term has vanished in his second. Trump’s net worth has jumped about $3 billion in the past year, according to Forbes’ estimates, driven largely by crypto ventures. But the money grab has reached tangible goods, too. The Trump Organization’s e-commerce outlet, TrumpStore.com, which largely shied away from presidential-themed swag during his first term, now has an entire 45-47 collection. And on Wednesday, the Trump Organization announced a licensed vendor’s release of the second edition of a silver coin. Selling for up to $460, the front shows Trump in profile with “president of the United States” emblazoned underneath.

How long the Coast Guard Exchanges have carried Trump wine, how much they’ve sold and the full extent to which other military exchanges and government facilities sell Trump products. (Clerks at the two confirmed stores said they were sold out, with one adding that they do not expect to restock it.)

Shortly before his inauguration in 2017, Trump attorney Sherri Dillon said her client “instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit.” Trump can earn income from his businesses while in office through the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, the same vehicle he used during his first term. He is its sole donor and beneficiary, while Donald Trump Jr. serves as the trustee. The trust owns 100% of the winery’s land and an LLC holding wine-related trademarks, according to Trump’s latest financial disclosure. The Trump Organization confirmed in an April regulatory filing in the United Kingdom that Trump retains control over his businesses while in office. Trump bought the vineyard and winery operations in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2011. Eric Trump serves as the business’s president, and an LLC bearing his name holds the trade name Trump Winery. Coast Guard Exchanges are government-run retail stores, which do not rely on appropriated funds, and sell tax-free goods to members of the Coast Guard and other qualified customers, such as active duty and retired military, and civilian employees. The National Archives Store, run by an independent nonprofit that partners with the archives, currently sells one of Trump’s books.

Now that all survivors can see the resolve bar, can people be nicer to those that just want to 8 hook and farm?

Some days I do want to play killer, but I'm not up for a sweat-fest (Today would be a good example). So I'll hop on a low-tier killer with the intent of playing kinda chill. Usually had Chest Bubba reserved for this, but...didn't always get interaction from it.

So can we take it as a sign if a killer gets hooks, gives anti-camp unhooks, and wanders off that they're not looking to put a lot of effort in for whatever reason? Even just a bad map.

Of course, you'll still have the odd fake friendly or such, but that can be partially sussed out just by doing bones, same as it has been.

I still want to do SOMETHING to get a few points, maybe farm some content for my channel, or even just be able to run on autopilot while I vibe with chat.

1panb5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1panb5b/oyoc_is_localization_of_llms_currently_in_a/,(OYOC) Is localization of LLMs currently in a Owning Your Own Cow phase?,"
So it recently occured to me the perfect analogy for business and individuals trying to host effective LLMs locally off the cloud and why this is in a stage of industry that I'm worried will be hard to evolve out of.

A young technology excited friend if mine was idealistically hand waving the issues of localizing his LLM of choice and running AI cloud free.

I think I found a ubiquitous market situation that applies to this that maybe is worth examining; the OYOC(Own your own cow) conundrum.

Owning your own local LLM is similar to say making your own milk. Yes you can get fresher milk in your house just by having a cow and not deal with big dairy and homogenized antibiotic produced factory products... But you need to build a barn, get a cow. Feed the cow, pick up it's shit, make sure it doesn't get sick and crash I mean die, avoid anyone stealing your milk so you need your own lock and security or the cow will get hacked, you need a backup cow Incase the first cow is updating or goes down, you. Now need two cows of food and two cows of bandwidth and computers ..but your barn was for one. So you build a bigger barn. ..now you are so busy with the cows and have so much tied up with them that you barely had any milk....and by the time you do enjoy this milk that was so hard to set up. Your cow is old and outdated and the big factory cows are cowGPT 6 and those cows have really dope faster milk. But if you want that milk locally you need to have an entire new architecture of barn and milking software ....so all your previous investments is worthless and outdated and you regret needing to localize your coffee's creamer.

A lot of entities right now both individuals and companies want private localized LLM capabilities for obvious reasons. It's not something that's impossible to do and many situations despite the cost it is worth it. However the issue is it's expensive not just in hardware but in power and the infrastructure. People and protocol needed to keep it running and working at a comparable or competitive pace with cloud options are exponentially more expensive then this but aren't even being counted.

This issue is efficiency. If you run this big nasty brain just for your local needs you need a bunch of stuff way bigger then those needs for the brain. The brain that's just to doing your basic stuff is going to cost you multiples more than the cloud cost because the cloud guys are serving so many people they can make their processes, power costs, and equipment prices lower then you because they scaled and planned their infrastructure around the cost of the brain and are fighting a war of efficiency.

Anyway here the analogy for the people who need to understand this and don't understand the way this stuff works that I think has many other parables in other industries and with advancement may change but isn't likely to every go away in all facets of this.

(Trenta sized rant/story time),"Hey, baristas. This is going to be a a Trenta sized post…I’ve got a lot to let go of. I’ve been a long time lurker, started working at Starbucks after at least 6 years of applying, and realized it’s not as great as people have made it seem. I started with high hopes and years of previous barista experience (6 years at a Wawa, and 1 year in an actual cafe.) I was so excited to finally become a Starbucks partner, I’ve had friends and family who worked at Starbucks before and loved the job and their time there! That was NOT my experience. I only made it a month and a half, this job was a major red flag.

My store…was an absolute mess. A dumpster fire. A train wreck. It was described as a store where “every man is for themselves.” The previous store manager was all smiles and definitely oversold the job when I was interviewed and hired, but as soon as I was actually on the floor and training, I found out she was actually the worst. She was a bully and hated new hires. Like…actually hated you and would walk on your heels, breathe down your neck and bark orders at you like a dog. All she cared about were the window times, except when SHE was on bar. SHE would take her time and make someone else work around her on the same bar. She would bully me for being new and slow. “Come on, seriously? Just take the drink and shove it out the window. Don’t give them anything else. You forgot napkins, are you stupid?? DONT GIVE THEM ANYTHING ELSE. Stop talking to the customer. Don’t let them talk to you. Just put in the order. Oh my god, did you SERIOUSLY put the drink in the system like that?? Hahahah oh my GOD! You should KNOW it goes in the system like this! What do you MEAN you don’t know how to use the clover vertica?!” These are all things that she would say to me and things she would say to the other new hire. Yes, seriously. Thankfully for me, she was transferred to a legacy store a couple weeks into working there. Everyone hated her and was on edge when she was there. Some of the SSVs offered all of us cash to write in her goodbye card. It was absolutely ridiculous but she made the first few weeks hell on earth. 

Because of her, my training was rushed and mainly just watching others on the sales floor, but not being able to retain anything. I made every single drink one time and they expected that to be enough training for me and the other person training with me to know the entire menu. The person who trained us had multiple breakdowns and crying sessions while training us because she was under so much pressure and wanted better for us. She knew we weren’t receiving what we deserved. I also missed a couple shifts during my training period because I got a nasty stomach virus. the bully SM tried to guilt me into coming in though, and my coworker who had Covid as well. :D LOVE that. I just cited the employee handbook and said I would not be coming in till I was symptom free. 

After “training”, all I knew how to do was DTR, some DTO, and clean play. And oh, they LOVED me on clean play. Expected me to do ALL the dirty work. To power clean and scrub the drains every Sunday night, drains that had been neglected before I even started. I had a couple SSVs try to put me on bar but got frustrated with me when I didn’t go as fast as they wanted me to go. So back to the window or back to clean play I would go. I also had SSVs who would REFUSE to let me on bar or practice, said I wasn’t allowed until I was with the company 6 months or longer. Soooo I was essentially shoved into a corner, OR I expected to run the entire floor by myself at times. I had a breakdown one night and had to leave because of it, it was awful. One of my coworkers tried to calm me down, but the shift saw me, a giant 28 year old man sobbing and said “well, if you’re gonna be like that, then you can just leave. Go home.” Thought I had taken off my headset, and said over the headset “this is freaking ridiculous and I GUESS we gotta switch everything around now! Fantastic!” And started to passive aggressively slam stuff. The store never felt the same after that night and I never felt respected by my team again. 

During my time with Starbucks, I had a couple SSVs and fellow baristas who would try to uplift me and provide reassurance, who would check in with me often, apologize, give as much support in position as they could, and beg me not to quit. But most of my store was incredibly judgmental and elitist, much like the previous manager. So a lot of the time, I would go from feeling like I was a valuable and essential member of the team, to feeling and being treated like a toddler, being shunned and not included.

The new store manager was incredibly kind and probably one of the most amazing managers I have had the chance to work with. I wanted to stay as long as I could for her. She made me feel seen and heard, and like she really did care. She would even help us out on the sales floor with anything AND wouldn’t complain about it or bark orders at us! WOW! We had a long talk about my mental health and how I was being treated, and she cried with me. Told me that the store I was at was rough and not what a Starbucks should be. Promised me she would schedule me for more in depth training at her other store (yes she was in charge of two locations), but that never happened. She never took off the schedule at my home store and never scheduled me those training shifts at the other store like she said she would. The only time I ever felt negative about her is the time she threatened to send me home on red cup day for coming in with a head cold, but that wasn’t why I was threatened. She threatened to send me home over wearing a mask. To protect customers and my coworkers. She said we weren’t allowed to wear masks at Starbucks no matter what and if I keep the mask on she would be forced to send me home. And I think that’s pretty insane to have a policy where you’re NOT ALLOWED to wear a mask. But other than that, she was amazing and I sincerely wish her all the best and more in life. She definitely deserves better than Starbucks.

The last thing that happened to me was a couple of days after the mask incident. I got progressively sicker and had a fever. Tis the freaking season I guess. I called out one day because I had a fever, tried to work the next day, but popped a fever again after making a trash run. One of my coworkers made me sit down and drink some cold water, telling me I was beet red and could tell I was having trouble breathing. The same SSV who sent me home while having a breakdown runs up to me in the back room and says “You’re sick?? You should go home. NO! You need to go home! Wait, but that’s not up to me, that’s ultimately up to you! Go ask the other manager. It’s up to the other manager. Yeah.” I went to go and talk to the other manager like she told me and explained the situation. I asked if I could just be on clean play and customer support but they said that “wasn’t an option” and wanted me to be on DTO even though we had PLENTY of other associates that day who could’ve done DTO. After that they just kept telling me to wait for them and hold on. Over and over. So I waited in the back room for 15 minutes, then decided to walk out the back door since they wouldn’t give me an answer other than “hold on”. I shouldn’t have done this, but at this point I was so tired and mentally exhausted from being sick, overworked, all the bullying, all the overstimulation from holiday launch, having to constantly yell “welcome in!” every time someone walked through the doors otherwise we would be threatened with write ups, red cup day and that bear cup hello kitty bullshit. I had a scheduled vacation the day after and spent some much needed time with my wife and my family.I messaged the store manager everything that happened in detail, and asked if i would still be employed after vacation, and she never messaged me back, only looked at the message. The time I had off gave me plenty of time to think, to weigh the pros and the cons.

The pros? My wonderful coworkers and regulars. Free college eventually. Coffee beans. The cons? Literally everything else.

Fast forward to last Sunday. The day I actually quit. I woke up, threw on my work clothes at 5:00am, and decided for the first time in my fucking life, it was time to be extra. I walked up to work an hour before I was supposed to start, pretended everything was fine, got myself a coffee, and impossible sandwich, collected ALL of my “freebies”, went to the back and wrote all of my coworkers a hand written note telling the how awesome or how terrible they were, left a note on the white board and on the desk saying I was promoting myself to customer effective immediately, collected my things, did the Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montana kiss and wave oh whoa whoaaaaa yeeeeeeahhh yeah yeahhhh combo and slid outta there right when I was supposed to clock in. I was stopped by my favorite coworker on my way out, told her what was going on. She teared up and gave me a hug, and wished me the best. Then I literally see my SSV, the one I had a problem with, chasing me across the parking lot yelling my name and saying “WHERE DO YOU THINK YOURE GOING?! WHATS WRONG??” To which I responded “Oh, I’m going home! I’m done! I have another job lined up, I’m sorry! Good luck and peace out! Have a great shift though!” Flashing the peace sign as I walked backwards slowly across the parking lot. It felt so nice to watch her throw a fit and crash out afterwards running back into the store yelling “Ooooh I cannot believe this! This is ridiculous!!!” My store manager messaged me apologizing profusely, but I just wished her well, went home, and spent time with my wife and daughter. Finally free from the sirens clutches.

I survived the store being severely understaffed and doing the work of multiple partners, the bear cup bullshit,holiday launch, red cup day, all of the protests, being forced to work while sick without a mask and all of the fucking bullying from my coworkers/SSVs, and my previous store manager. I tried my best and tried to uplift everyone along the way but in the end, I just couldn’t do it anymore. Couldn’t hang. And now my view of Starbucks has forever changed, I don’t know if I ever want to give them my business again.

If you’re reading this, thinking about quitting, this is your sign. There is a whole world out there just waiting for you. You deserve so much better than Starbucks can offer you and your mental health matters. Please, take care of yourselves. 

So yeah, long, Trenta sized story. And that’s not even a fraction of the tiny details I could share. But I don’t want to bore yall too much. However! I would LOVE to hear y’all’s quitting stories as well! Trenta sized like mine, or short and sweet like a brown sugar oat milk cortado. Share away, baristas! And thank you so much for reading and hearing me out. Good luck this holiday season…really. My heart goes out to each and every one of you. This job is wild and I hope you’re having a way better experience than me. You deserve it.",1,1764522125.0,starbucks,1,0.67,False
1pananc,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrangeCountyRehab/comments/1pananc/sober_living_what_to_look_for_what_to_avoid_and/,"Sober Living: What to Look For, What to Avoid, and What It Costs","Sober living homes (also called transitional housing or recovery residences) are an essential bridge between intensive treatment and independent living. Orange County has one of the highest concentrations of sober living homes in the country. Here's everything you need to know.

# What Is Sober Living?

Sober living homes are residential facilities where people in recovery live together in a structured, substance-free environment. Unlike treatment centers, sober living homes focus on accountability and community rather than therapy.

Key characteristics: Peer-run or minimally supervised (not 24/7 staff like residential treatment), residents live there while working, going to school, or attending outpatient treatment, house rules and accountability structure, drug/alcohol testing, usually 6-12 residents per house, shared bedrooms (typically 2-4 people per room), and communal living (shared kitchen, living spaces).

Sober living is NOT residential treatment (no intensive therapy on-site), halfway house (those are typically court-mandated, more restrictive), or independent apartment living (this has structure and rules).

# Who Sober Living Is For

Ideal candidates: Completed residential treatment and need continued support, completed detox and attending outpatient treatment (IOP/PHP), leaving an unhealthy living situation (family who uses, abusive relationship), need accountability and structure while rebuilding life, want peer support from others in recovery, testing out sobriety before fully independent living, or have no stable housing.

May not be right for you if you're unwilling to follow house rules, not committed to sobriety, need intensive medical or psychiatric care, unwilling to participate in house responsibilities, prefer complete independence, or have violent tendencies.

# Levels of Sober Living

The National Alliance for Recovery Residences (NARR) defines four levels:

Level 1: Peer-Run

* No paid staff on-site
* Residents manage the house themselves
* Least expensive ($600-$1,200/month)
* More independence, less supervision

Level 2: Monitored

* House manager lives on-site or visits regularly
* Basic services (drug testing, house meetings)
* Most common type in Orange County
* $800-$2,000/month

Level 3: Supervised

* Paid staff present regularly
* May include case management, life skills training
* Often connected to outpatient treatment programs
* $1,500-$3,000/month

Level 4: Service-Intensive

* 24/7 staffing
* On-site services (therapy, case management, medical)
* For people with co-occurring disorders or special needs
* $2,500-$5,000+/month
* Closer to residential treatment than traditional sober living

Most Orange County sober living falls into Level 2 (Monitored).

# What to Look For: Quality Indicators

Certification and Licensing:

California doesn't require licensing for sober living homes, which means quality varies wildly. Look for:

NARR Certified (National Alliance for Recovery Residences): Meets national standards, regular inspections, trained house managers. Can verify at narronline.org.

CAARR Affiliated (California Alliance of Addiction Recovery Resources): State-level certification, similar standards to NARR.

Local regulatory compliance: Some Orange County cities have additional regulations. Check if the home is properly permitted.

Red flag: If they refuse to disclose certification or licensing status, walk away.

House Rules and Structure:

Good sober living homes have clear, written rules including random drug/alcohol testing (usually 1-2x per week, sometimes more), mandatory house meetings (weekly at minimum), curfews or check-in requirements (common for first 30-90 days), 12-step meeting requirements (typically 3-5 meetings per week) OR alternatives like SMART Recovery, chore responsibilities (shared cleaning, cooking), visitor policies (usually restricted, especially overnight guests), employment or treatment requirements (must be working, in school, or attending treatment), no romantic relationships (at least for first 30-90 days), and consequences for rule violations (written warnings, increased testing, discharge).

Red flag: Vague or unenforced rules equals high relapse rates.

Safety and Conditions:

Before moving in, tour the house and check for clean, well-maintained property (no mold, pests, or major damage, working appliances, adequate bathrooms for number of residents, safe neighborhood), adequate space (50+ square feet per person in bedrooms, not more than 4 people per bedroom, common areas for residents to socialize), emergency protocols (fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, clear evacuation plan, contact info for house manager, protocol for medical emergencies), and privacy considerations (locks on bedroom doors or not depending on house philosophy, secure storage for personal items, reasonable noise policies).

Red flags: Overcrowding (6+ people in one room), unsafe conditions (broken stairs, mold, no heat/AC), located next to bars or known drug areas, or no fire safety equipment.

Financial Transparency:

Look for clear pricing structure (monthly rent amount, security deposit typically first plus last month rent, what's included like utilities, internet, food, additional fees for drug testing or application fee), refund policy (what happens if you leave early, how much notice is required), and written rental agreement (should clearly outline all terms, your rights and responsibilities, house rules, termination conditions).

Red flags: Refusing to provide written agreement, unclear or changing fees, pressure to commit without seeing the house, or no refund policy.

House Manager Quality:

The house manager makes or breaks the experience. Look for manager who has personal recovery experience (not required, but helpful), has proper training (NARR house manager certification, CPR/First Aid, crisis intervention training), is accessible (lives on-site OR available 24/7 by phone, reasonable response time to issues), and enforces rules consistently (not playing favorites, actually drug testing regularly, following through with consequences).

Meet the house manager before committing. Ask current residents about their experience with management.

Community and Culture:

Talk to current residents (good homes will let you). Ask how long have they been there, what do they like/dislike, does management actually enforce rules, and how's the house culture.

Ask about resident demographics like age range (big age gaps can be challenging), gender (some houses are gender-specific, some co-ed), and average length of stay.

Understand the recovery philosophy: 12-step focused (AA/NA required), faith-based, secular/evidence-based, or LGBTQ+ affirming.

Choose a house whose philosophy aligns with yours.

# Cost Breakdown in Orange County

Average Monthly Costs:

Basic Sober Living (Level 1-2):

* Inland areas (Santa Ana, Anaheim): $800-$1,200
* Mid-OC (Costa Mesa, Irvine): $1,200-$1,800
* Coastal (Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, Laguna): $1,500-$2,500

Upscale Sober Living (Level 2-3):

* $2,000-$4,000/month
* Often includes: private or semi-private rooms, better amenities, nicer neighborhoods, case management

High-End/Luxury (Level 3-4):

* $3,000-$7,000+/month
* Includes: private rooms, pools, chef-prepared meals, on-site services, gym access, located in expensive areas

What's Typically Included:

Usually included in rent: Shared bedroom, utilities (electricity, water, gas), internet/WiFi, weekly house meetings, and random drug testing (1-2x per week).

Sometimes included: Food (groceries provided, or residents shop for themselves), laundry (in-house washer/dryer), transportation to meetings (some houses provide).

Usually NOT included: Personal items and toiletries, phone plan, transportation to work, or outside treatment or therapy.

Additional Costs to Budget For:

* Security deposit: Usually first plus last month rent ($1,600-$5,000)
* Drug testing: Some charge per test ($10-$30/test) if not included
* Application fee: $25-$100
* Food: $200-$400/month if not provided
* Transportation: Gas or bus passes
* 12-step meeting expenses: Coffee, occasional dinners with sponsor

Total first month cost: $2,500-$7,000+ depending on area and house

Paying for Sober Living:

Insurance: Most insurance does NOT cover basic sober living. Some Level 3-4 homes with intensive services may get partial coverage. Always verify with your insurance.

Self-pay: Most common payment method. Some homes offer payment plans.

Scholarships: Some homes offer reduced rent for residents who can't afford full price. Often requires proof of income/financial hardship. May require additional service to the house (extra chores, house manager assistant).

SSI/Disability: Some sober living homes accept SSI/disability payments. Rent is adjusted to affordable level for SSI recipients.

# Geographic Considerations in Orange County

Santa Ana / Anaheim (Central OC): Pros: Most affordable, close to services, diverse recovery community Cons: Higher crime in some areas, more urban

Costa Mesa / Irvine (Mid-OC): Pros: Balance of cost and safety, central location, good job market Cons: Mid-range prices, can still be expensive

Huntington Beach / Newport Beach / Laguna Beach (Coastal): Pros: Beach access, upscale neighborhoods, strong recovery community, lots of meetings Cons: Expensive ($1,500-$3,000+/month), can feel disconnected from ""real world""

Stanton / Fullerton / Orange (North OC): Pros: More affordable, quieter residential areas Cons: Fewer sober living options, farther from some treatment centers

Consider proximity to your job, outpatient treatment program, support network, and meeting locations.

# Red Flags: Avoid These Houses

* Not NARR or CAARR certified and refuses to explain why
* Owner has financial ties to treatment centers (beware of kickback schemes where they get paid to refer residents)
* No drug testing, or testing is optional/infrequent
* No consequences for rule violations (people get high, nothing happens)
* Current residents seem unhappy or on edge
* High turnover (ask how many people have left in past 3 months)
* Manager is rarely available or responsive
* Pressure to sign immediately without touring house
* Won't let you talk to current residents
* Vague about house rules or recovery expectations
* Located in unsafe area or next to bars/liquor stores
* Allows overnight guests or has loose visitor policies
* Doesn't require recovery meetings or any accountability structure
* Poor reviews online (check Google, Yelp, recovery forums)

# Questions to Ask Before Moving In

About the House:

1. Are you NARR or CAARR certified?
2. How many residents live here? What's the maximum capacity?
3. How many people per bedroom?
4. What's included in monthly rent?
5. What are the additional fees?
6. What's your refund/move-out policy?
7. Can I see a copy of the rental agreement before signing?

About Structure and Rules: 8. What are the house rules? 9. How often is drug testing? What happens if someone tests positive? 10. What are the meeting requirements? 11. Is there a curfew? 12. What are the visitor policies? 13. What are employment/treatment requirements? 14. What happens if I relapse?

About Management and Support: 15. Who is the house manager and what are their qualifications? 16. Is the manager on-site or off-site? 17. How do I reach the manager in an emergency? 18. What services or support do you provide? 19. Do you help with job placement or other resources?

About Current Residents: 20. What's the typical age range of residents? 21. How long do people typically stay? 22. Can I speak with current residents? 23. What's the house culture like?

About Recovery Philosophy: 24. Is this a 12-step house? Are alternatives accepted? 25. Is this faith-based or secular? 26. Is this LGBTQ+ affirming? 27. What's your philosophy on Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)? (e.g., Suboxone)

# Length of Stay Recommendations

Minimum: 90 days. Research shows 90+ days significantly improves outcomes. Most houses require 30-day minimum, but that's rarely enough.

Ideal: 6-12 months. Gives you time to build solid recovery foundation, allows you to save money and get stable employment, and develop healthy routines and coping skills.

Some people stay longer: 1-2 years is not uncommon. Some transition to becoming house managers. Others stay while building up resources to afford their own place.

Don't rush leaving sober living. Early independent living often leads to relapse.

# Transitioning Out of Sober Living

Signs you might be ready: 6+ months of continuous sobriety, stable employment or income, strong recovery support network (sponsor, sober friends, regular meetings), healthy coping skills for stress and triggers, financial stability (savings, can afford rent plus expenses), plan for ongoing recovery support after leaving, and no recent cravings or close calls.

Not ready to leave if you've had recent relapse or close calls, have unstable employment, no support network outside the house, are planning to live alone with no accountability, or are skipping meetings or recovery activities.

Transitional options: Move to less structured sober living, get roommates who are also in recovery, continue outpatient therapy and regular meeting attendance, and stay connected to sober living alumni network.

# Finding Sober Living in Orange County

2. Ask your questions over the phone
3. Schedule tours of top choices
4. Talk to current residents
5. Check online reviews
6. Verify certification
7. Read rental agreement carefully before signing

# Final Thoughts

Sober living can be the difference between long-term recovery and relapse. It provides the structure and community many people need while rebuilding their lives.

Don't rush into the cheapest option. Quality matters more than cost. A good sober living home is an investment in your future.

Don't stay isolated. The peer support in sober living is one of its biggest benefits. Engage with housemates, participate in house activities, be part of the community.

Be honest about your needs. If you need more structure, choose Level 3-4. If you're ready for independence, Level 1-2 might work. Match the house to where you are in recovery.

A few things about me: • I read and write like I’m being chased by a deadline no one actually gave me. • I dip my fries in Frostys because that is how God intended potatoes to be enjoyed. • I pour liquids into bottle caps and pretend they’re shots, because sometimes you just need to feel like you’re at a club even though it’s Tuesday at 3pm and your “drink” is orange Gatorade. • I invent elaborate backstories for strangers at Target, usually involving secret royal bloodlines, cursed heirlooms, or mild tax fraud. • I embarrass my loved ones using offensive-to-no-one but highly dramatic accents in public. • I hunt for new music like it’s treasure, and when I find a song that emotionally drop-kicks me, I listen to it while curled up in the shower like I’m in an A24 coming-of-age movie.

I’m hoping to meet people who are… real. Real complex. Real simple. Real funny. Real soft where it matters. Real in need (or want) of a connection that’s based on mutual kindness, random serotonin drops, and daily attempts to make each other smile.

Bonus points if you are also powered by a chaotic blend of coffee, energy drinks, and pure stubborn willpower — the kind of person who wakes up, cracks open a caffeinated potion, and thinks, “Yes. I choose life.”

If you’re the type who finds joy in tiny things — like the perfect playlist, a particularly chaotic group chat, or the moment your caffeine finally kicks in and you achieve temporary godhood — we’ll get along beautifully.

So yeah… if you’re looking for a friend who’s funny, genuine, occasionally poetic, occasionally feral, and always up for a laugh, send me a message.

Remembering the 18,500 bridges we built.","It is hard to remember now, through the smoke and the pain of the last two years, but before October 7th, the border wasn't just a wall of fire. It was a crossing point for **18,500** human beings.

Every day, thousands of fathers, brothers, and sons crossed from Gaza into Israel to work. They weren't just ""permit holders."" They were colleagues. They were the people who built our homes, paved our roads, and harvested our fields alongside us.

**A Real Story:** I want to tell you about **Hashim al-Birawi**. Hashim wasn't a politician. He was a contractor from Beit Lahiya who worked in the Israeli kibbutzim for decades. He worked in the avocado and banana orchards of Kibbutz Ruhama. His Israeli employer, Lior Golan, didn't just see him as a worker. He knew Hashim’s wife. He knew his kids. When the sirens screamed on the morning of October 7th, Lior’s first instinct wasn't to run—it was to call Hashim to make sure he was safe. Hashim was killed that morning by Hamas terrorists at the Sa'ad intersection. He died trying to come to work, killed by the very people claiming to ""liberate"" him.

**The Lesson:** We are taught in the Torah: **""וְאָהַבְתָּ לְרֵעֲךָ כָּמוֹךָ""** (*Ve-ahavta le-re'acha kamocha*) - **""Love your neighbor as yourself.""** (Leviticus 19:18).

This isn't just a nice sticker for a bumper. It is a challenge. Hillel the Elder famously explained this principle: *""What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow.""*

For years, Israelis and Gazans like Lior and Hashim were living this reality quietly. They shared coffee. They shared work. They shared the land. They proved that coexistence isn't a fantasy for the future—it was a reality that existed until hate tore it apart.

**Our Wish:** We don't just want a ceasefire. We want to go back to the days when Lior could call Hashim. We want a future where ""Love your neighbor"" isn't a commandment we struggle with, but a reality we live.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",2,1764521625.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Miles over the limit, generator charges, cleaning fees, “extra linen” fees… it always felt like a trap.

This time we tried **Dufourfun RV Rentals**, and it was honestly the first rental where the price didn’t change. Not once. It was genuinely all-inclusive, which I didn’t even think was a real thing in the RV world.

The biggest shock for me was the *unlimited* part. Unlimited miles actually meant unlimited. We did a whole loop through Georgia, Tennessee, and back home to Alabama and didn’t have to calculate anything. Same with the generator hours — it was unlimited too, which felt weirdly freeing because I didn’t have to ration it like past trips.

The RV came completely ready to go. I’m talking linens on the bed, dishes already in the cabinets, toiletries, cleaning stuff, even a coffee maker. We packed our clothes and groceries and that was literally it. And when we brought it back, they told us just to drop it off. No cleaning, no emptying tanks, none of that “return it exactly how you got it” pressure.

Another thing that stood out is they’re a family-run business. When we had a random question about the water heater at like 10pm, an actual person answered. Not a call center. Not some “we’ll escalate this” nonsense.

They also included access to a huge list of free campsites — over 5,000 of them — which saved us a surprising amount of money because we didn’t need to pay for campgrounds every night.

The part that really shocked me was that they have a money-back offer if something mechanically breaks and they can’t fix it. I’ve never seen that with RV rentals. It made the whole thing feel way less risky.

Anyway, if you’re in **Alabama, Georgia, or Tennessee** and you’re tired of RV rentals pretending to be cheap and then hitting you with surprises, this is the first time I’ve walked away from a trip paying exactly what I expected.

**TL;DR:** Dufourfun was the only RV rental we’ve used that was actually all-inclusive — unlimited miles, stocked RV, no cleaning, no hidden fees.",1,1764521506.0,RVRentalNearYou,0,1.0,False

I have reasons for this; I believe my current coffee capsule situation may be contributing to some elevated inflammation markers.

So I plan to start doing pour overs...  And maybe pick up that plastic and aluminum-free drip coffee maker that is shipping soon for times I just want to grind a few cups and dump it in a brewer and walk away, drinking a few cups over a couple hours.

I do not mind paying for quality, and I do not want to buy a grinder that is a 'starter' that ends up being wasted when either it fails or I decide I just want better results.

I'm pretty darn convinced that microplastics are killing us slowly, in various ways.  Can't be eliminated but can work to minimize it.  So I'm pretty satisfied I will not be wasting my money here.

There are so many sales going on now...  Machines I've considered...  Femobook A5, Tinemore 78s, Fellows Ode 2...  Even considered the Varia VS6, but just don't want to pay the tariff.   Especially when there has been a comment or two that has me worried about quality (partially due to the VS3), and I don't want the hassles of shipping it back, versus buying something from Amazon.

I know there are threads all over on which electric grinder to buy...  I've read a lot of them.  And watched a number of review videos...  Just thought with the current sales going on, and my specific budget ($500-$700), I figured I would solicit some input.

Edit:  I do care about ease of cleaning / maintenance.  I saw a comment about one of the above I think suggesting that the burrs required frequent realignment.  That would be a little annoying.  As would a difficult cleaning process.

1pan0xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1pan0xe/march_niseko_kansai_trip_help/,March Niseko / Kansai trip help!,"Hello!
My partner and I are heading to Japan in early March. The plan is 5 days in Hokkaido for snowboarding, then 5 days based in Osaka. 

Goals: snowboarding, onsen, good food, some shopping, a couple cocktails, light sightseeing. 

Already booked: 
Flights - arrive CTS 18:30 Mar 2, fly CTS to KIX Mar 7 (~14:30 arrival). 
Hotels - Niseko: Hotel Kanronomori Mar 2-6 (late check in confirmed)
Osaka: Ryokan Kuramoto Mar 7-12. 
Both spots have onsen!!! Trying to get in the bath every night.

Still need: rental car for Niseko, lift passes, a couple dinners, international license, maybe a tea/matcha experience, maybe a guide day.



Current itinerary:
Mar 2: Land CTS 18:30, rental car, drive to Niseko (~2.5 hrs), check in ~22:00, eat whatever’s open, sleep.

Mar 3-6: Snowboarding Niseko United (rotating Hirafu, Hanazono, Annupuri, Niseko Village). Evenings: onsen + rest. Possible dinners: The Barn by Odin, Rakuichi Soba (reserve), Niseko Pizza, Bang Bang. One night maybe browse Rhythm Japan or Hokkaido Natural Market.

Mar 7: Fly CTS to KIX, check in at Kuramoto, Dotonbori/Namba night walk, street food + Don Quijote.

Mar 8: Osaka - maybe Strawberry Festival, Amerikamura for skate shops/thrift/streetwear, dinner around Namba, maybe drinks if not wiped.

Mar 9: Day trip to Kyoto + Uji. Morning plum blossoms at Kitano Tenmangu or Jonangu. Train to Uji after for matcha tastings/Byodoin/wagashi/river walk. Not trying to overload but open to ideas.

Mar 10: Free wander day - maybe bikes, random trains, no structured plan. Maybe onsen in Ryokan all day

Mar 11: Osaka coffee (LiLo or Mouton), shopping Namba Parks/Loft/Tokyu Hands/Tower Records/Ichi Osaka Skate, maybe Sumiyoshi-taisha or Osaka Castle Park if blossoms hang on. Last dinner Harukoma or Endo Sushi.

Mar 12: Fly home - slow morning, konbini breakfast, airport.


Debating: less structure, hiring Kansai guide, teamLab Kyoto, which Uji matcha experience, whether Kyoto + Uji is too much in one day.

Note: Bringing snowboard gear because we go directly to a Montana ski wedding after. 
Annoying to haul but unavoidable. Planning to arrive early for flights and book a rental car that fits a board.

Questions for you all: 
Does the pacing feel relaxed or too loaded? 
Any swaps you’d recommend? 
Is Kyoto+Uji realistic or better split? 
Best Osaka/Uji/coffee/skate/music shops? 
Good spots to wander without a plan? 

Also any suggestions for the right type of tape to cover tattoos for onsen?

Here’s everything that stood out:

* **Unlimited mileage + unlimited generator hours** (no fine print, no upcharges)
* **5,000+ free campspots included**, which saved us a ton on overnight fees
* **Fully stocked RV** — linens, cookware, toiletries, coffee maker, all already loaded
* **Zero cleanup** required at return, which felt wild compared to other rentals
* **24/7 support from a real RV expert**, not a call center
* **Money-back mechanical promise** if something breaks and they can’t fix it
* They’re **family-owned**, and the level of personal service shows

For context:  
They’re based in north Alabama but deliver across **Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee**, which makes pickup/drop-off super easy regardless of your route.

Originally from a warm island, now freezing somewhere close to Santas house. I write songs, poetry and I am hopeless romantic.

A little about me:

•I speak 6 languages fluently (fumbling through a 7th). Multilingual chaos.
•I want kids someday.
•I’d prefer if you’re based in Europe (long distance is tough, though I’ll put in the effort if you’re truly worth it).
•I fix teams and people for a living.

What I’m looking for (23–29):
•Someone witty, sarcastic, and not afraid of playful banter
•A dark sense of humor (and an even darker cup of coffee)
•Curious by nature, whether it’s history, philosophy, spirituality or why autumn is the best season ever.

Music is therapy for me. If you’re into Linkin Park, RHCP, Metallica, Audioslave, Poets of the Fall, Eminem, NF, Logic, or Kodaline, we’ll probably click.

What I’m not into: ghosting, endless small talk, or fake fronts.

What I am into: honesty, deep conversations, loyal connections, and maybe a little bit of chaos wrapped in comfort.

I met a guy on a dating app, where we would meet up for coffee and then go for a walk. We started to message on Snapchat where i got to know him a little bit . He seemed quite sweet and friendly. But he started to push me to meet up. But we couldn’t because I was busy. We then met up. I met him at the cafe where I was. 

We had a chat about lives, he told me a few stories about his experiences and it was pretty cool. We then went for a walk in the walk way I had found. It was a beautiful little wooded area little bit away from town but you could see the town opposite and people would travel on boats on the canal. 

We went for the walk where we were chatting and having a good time, he made me laugh and I was nervous about this date.

When we reached a little wooden plank to sit on right next to the canal we were talking about bartending and shots. 

Then I laid down and he laid next to me and started to touch me up. He felt my chest, then started to rub his nose on my neck. I was frozen and I could feel his weight on me, and couldn’t breathe. All I could smell was his breath and I felt uncomfortable and froze. Staring up at the sky. 

He then started to grind his hips on me. And I just stared at the sky. Frozen.

He was like “Let me show you some moves.” And I was like ok…? 


So we did some defensive moves and then he started again while I just laid there. 

When we went back to town because he had to go home. I started hyperventilating. 
 I was uncomfortable. 

When I got home. I took a shower and scrubbed myself hard.

He didn’t answer. A minute later, my phone vibrated three times.

First: a link to some old, ugly forum.

Second: a screenshot of a thread titled Cinder Hollow / The Skinned Man (DO NOT GO THERE).

Third: a separate text.

40.8319, -78.3941

No “lol.” No explanation. Just coordinates.

what is this

No answer.

I tried calling. It rang twice, then went to voicemail. Not unusual. I figured he was driving. I fell asleep eventually.

The next morning, he wasn’t at school.

By lunch, everyone knew he hadn’t come home from his shift.

By the weekend, his mom had flyers up. The news ran a short segment. “Last seen making deliveries in the late evening.” They showed a generic shot of a car with the delivery logo. They talked about his “last known route.”

They didn’t mention the coordinates.

Nobody knew he’d sent them to me.

I clicked the link.

The forum looked ancient—black background, gray text, no avatars. The original poster of the thread had deleted their account. Their post described an abandoned town in the woods off a forgotten stretch of highway in Pennsylvania. No signs. No services. A church. A basement. A well that “went down wrong.” Flesh on the walls, “still talking.”

They called it Cinder Hollow.

They talked about something they called the Skinned Man.

Most replies were jokes and arguments. But a few accounts didn’t comment anywhere else, and they all said some version of the same thing:

where did our skin go

Buried halfway down the thread, I found Mason’s numbers.

40.8319, -78.3941

Underneath, someone had written:

it’s the church u have to go down in the church

That user never posted again.

When I clicked the coordinates, my maps app dropped a pin in the middle of a huge patch of green. Zoom in: trees, a thin gray line that might be a road. Zoom out: no town name. No labels.

That was the night the noises in my house started.

I woke up around three to the sound of footsteps above my room.

Our house is one story with an unfinished attic. No one goes up there except my dad once a year. There is no reason for anyone to be walking around overhead.

Soft, careful steps. A creak. A pause, like whoever was up there had stopped to listen.

The air in my room felt heavy. I told myself it was the house settling. Old wood. Temperature drop.

Then something scraped across the ceiling. Slowly. Like a heavy bag being dragged.

The steps passed directly over my bed.

I lay there with my eyes open, staring at the dark, counting my breaths until the house went quiet again.

In the morning, Dad looked tired over his coffee.

“You were up late,” he said. “Sounded like someone walking around. Neighbor texted me, said they thought they saw your light on at one.”

“I never got out of bed,” I said.

He shrugged. “House is old, Luke. Don’t overthink it.”

There it was—that little dismissive shrug I’d pictured. I didn’t mention the coordinates or the thread or the Skinned Man. Saying it out loud felt like daring him to call me crazy.

The noises came back the next night.

Sometimes footsteps. Sometimes light scratching. Once, three slow knocks from inside my closet wall. I’d wake up to find my bedroom door cracked open when I was sure I’d closed it. My desk chair angled a little toward my bed. The curtain caught in a way I didn’t remember.

I kept going back to the thread.

Most of the images were broken, but one blurry screenshot showed an empty street, trees leaning in, boarded buildings. Someone had circled a pale shape in an upper window. Another picture was nearly black; the caption just said:

basement. don’t go down if you hear them

Brightened, it was a gray smear with what might have been a ring of stones.

I started dreaming about a well.

I also kept thinking about stupid, ordinary things about Mason—him drumming on the steering wheel, stealing exactly two fries, the way he always wanted to push “just a little further” any time we explored someplace we shouldn’t.

He pushed too far without me this time.

That’s what finally made me go.

On Friday, I waited until Dad’s truck turned the corner for his double shift. The house settled into quiet. I grabbed my backpack.

Flashlight. Batteries. A folding knife from the junk drawer. Water. Hoodie. Phone charger. Battery pack.

I left a note on the counter.

Went to hang out with Josh. Back later. –L

The drive out of town felt normal. Same stores, same traffic, same stupid songs on the radio. I followed the GPS until it told me to turn onto what looked like nothing—just a thin break in the trees.

The road was cracked, half-eaten by weeds. Branches scraped the car. My signal dropped. Two bars. One. None.

The map froze with my little blue arrow pointed into blank green.

After a while, I passed a rusted-out car in a ditch, nose-down, a tree growing through its sunroof. Faded spray paint on the door read:

D N’T ST P

I drove on.

The trees opened up just enough to show me the remains of a town.

Cinder Hollow.

Main street, small square, a handful of two-story buildings. Most windows boarded or broken. Streetlights bent. A gas station with no pumps. A faded convenience store sign with no store beneath it.

I pulled in behind an SUV with every door hanging open and a pickup that had no bed.

When I stepped out, the silence punched me. No traffic, no planes, no dogs. Even the birds seemed to avoid the place.

The pavement was dusty and cracked. In that dust, I saw footprints. Several sets, different sizes, some sharp-edged, some half-faded.

People had been here.

More signs the further I went: a crushed water bottle with this year’s date on it; a backpack slumped under a collapsed awning; a tripod with no camera. A laundromat with all the washers pried open and forgotten clothes petrified in them. A barbershop, chair on its side, scissors on the floor.

On its door, scrawled in marker:

DON’T LET IT MEASURE YOU

I didn’t want to know what that meant.

A small playground sat behind a leaning fence. Chains swung with no seats. A single child’s sneaker lay on its side in the dirt.

At the end of the street, the town opened into a square.

The church stood in the middle.

Blackened stone walls, vines climbing up them. Broken steeple. Shattered stained glass. The double doors were closed. A red arrow had been spray painted on one door, pointing inward.

Under the arrow:

THIS IS WHERE THEY WENT DOWN

I stood at the bottom of the steps, staring. If Mason had come here, this is where he would have ended up.

Inside. Down.

I opened the door.

It groaned. Cold, sour air rolled out—wet stone, mold, and something metallic underneath.

Inside, light from broken windows showed crooked pews and a shattered altar. Empty water bottles and a dead flashlight lay near the back.

On the floor, words had been carved into the planks, deep and jagged:

NO WAY BACK ONCE YOU HEAR THEM

An arrow scratched next to the words pointed toward a side door behind the altar.

I followed it.

The side hall was narrow and dark. My flashlight-beam picked out peeling paint, old pipes, nothing else. It ended at a set of concrete stairs going down. Above the first step, someone had spray painted:

YOU REALLY DON’T HAVE TO DO THIS

They were right.

I thought about turning back. I also thought about that screenshot of the coordinates and the last message Mason ever sent me.

I went down.

The air got colder, wetter. It smelled like mold and pennies. My footsteps echoed.

Halfway, I heard the first voice.

“Help…”

Thin, strained, floating up from below.

Another voice joined it.

“Please… it hurts…”

Then more, overlapping. Different tones, different ages, all frayed.

“Don’t leave us…”

“Where did our skin go…”

That phrase, out loud, in multiple voices at once, made my stomach twist.

At the bottom of the stairs, the basement opened into a large room. Stone walls, low ceiling with pipes, cracked concrete floor.

And in the center, a well.

Waist-high ring of stones, rusted chain hanging over it. The rim was slick and dark, stained.

The voices weren’t coming from the well. They seeped from everywhere.

“Please…”

“Make it stop…”

My flashlight hit the far wall.

For a second I couldn’t understand what I was seeing.

The wall was coated in flesh.

Red muscle, white tendon, veins pulsing beneath a thin sheen of fluid. It climbed up the wall, across the ceiling, down toward the floor in folds and ropes.

Embedded in it were pieces of people.

Eyes, some open and rolling, some crusted shut. Mouths opening and closing, lips shredded, teeth exposed. Fingers poking out, flexing weakly before the meat swallowed them again. Half-formed faces pushed forward and sank back.

“Help us…” one mouth sobbed.

“Don’t leave…” another gurgled.

Hands reached out of the wall, skinless and shaking.

“Lu…ke…”

My name came from the center.

The mass bulged, reshaping. Eyes squeezed out of tissue, a mouth pulled itself open, features sliding into place in a way that made me want to be sick.

Freckles. Crooked front tooth. A mole near the right eye.

“Mason,” I said.

His eyes focused, bloodshot and too wide.

“It… hurts, man,” he rasped. His voice sounded wet and wrong. “Please… make it stop…”

Tissue pulled at his face every time he spoke, trying to drag him back in.

“I’m sorry,” I said. My throat burned.

“It talked to us,” he forced out. “Said we’d be warm. Said it didn’t waste anything. I thought it was just… an internet thing. Just wanted to see if it was real…”

He blinked hard. Tears mixed with whatever else slicked his face.

“Don’t let it take you too,” he whispered. “Don’t let it wear you…”

The rest of the wall whimpered.

“Where did our skin go…” someone keened overhead.

I stumbled back until I hit stone on the opposite side. My flashlight beam jerked toward where the stairwell had been.

There was no stairwell.

Just solid wall.

I slammed my free hand against it. Rough, damp stone met my palm. I clawed along the surface, searching for any seam.

Nothing.

“You can’t go,” a voice gibbered from the flesh. “No door. No up. Just down…”

Something laughed.

It vibrated through the floor, up my legs, into my teeth. It came from the well.

“New skin…” a voice crooned. Not from the wall. From everywhere. “New skin walked down all by himself. Didn’t even have to be chased.”

The chain over the well rattled and rose, like something was pulling it from below.

“Luke…” Mason gasped. “Run…”

“There’s nowhere to run in the den,” the other voice said, almost cheerful.

The chain stopped.

Something rose out of the darkness.

It came up in one smooth motion, like it was being pushed from underneath. A column of glistening red broke the surface and unfolded into limbs and torso.

No skin anywhere.

Bare muscle, wet and moving. Bones visible underneath. Tendons sliding. The head turned toward me: empty sockets full of twitching tissue, stripped nose, lipless grin full of yellow, human teeth arranged too wide.

Strips of dried skin hung from its shoulders like a cloak. Some tattooed, some small. One bore a faded delivery app logo.

“New skin,” it said. The sound was dozens of voices layered into one. “You heard the choir and came down. You opened the door.”

My legs wouldn’t move.

The Skinned Man stepped away from the well. With every movement, the muscles on its frame crawled, like they were still trying to decide where they belonged. The hanging skins rustled softly.

“Why?” I managed. “Why them?”

Its head tilted.

“Because they knocked,” it said. “They found the road. They followed the numbers. I answered. I like the curious ones. They always come alone.”

It lifted a hand. Bone hooks jutted from each finger.

“Don’t…” Mason croaked.

The Skinned Man turned toward his voice.

“You have so much to say,” it said. “You all do.”

It plunged its hand into the wall.

Every voice screamed.

The sound was one massive, tearing shriek. The meat writhed around its arm. Faces twisted. Hands spasmed. Dust rained down. My ears rang so hard I thought something in my head had ruptured.

The Skinned Man stirred its arm, then yanked it free. Strings of flesh clung and snapped back.

“See?” it said. “Still feeling. Still warm.”

That broke something loose in me.

I bolted.

I ran along the wall, away from the well, flashlight beam bouncing, shoes slipping on damp concrete. In the far corner, a low archway gaped between fallen stones.

I dove through, scraping my shoulders.

A narrow passage. Low ceiling. Pipes overhead dripping rusty water onto my neck. The air tasted like rot.

Behind me, its voice followed.

“Little mouse in the cracks,” it called. “My den is very old. I always find the cracks.”

A metal door sagged at the end of the passage, covered in deep scratches.

I hit it full force.

It shrieked open, and I stumbled into a smaller room with stone walls and a low ceiling. Collapsed shelves. Broken jars. And on the far wall, a stack of crates under a boarded-up window.

Light leaked through the gaps.

Real outside light.

The wall beside the door swelled outward, stone rippling.

I scrambled up the crates. They wobbled dangerously. I grabbed a board and yanked. It held. Splinters bit my palms. I braced my shoulder and pulled harder.

It cracked down the middle.

Cold air rushed in through the gap.

Behind me, stone split with a wet tearing sound. Fingers of bone pushed through.

“New skin wants the sky,” the Skinned Man hummed. “They always think the sky means out.”

I tore at the remaining boards. Wood snapped. Nails screamed. The opening widened.

I shoved myself through.

Broken wood scraped my arms and ribs. My injured shoulder hit the edge. It felt like someone pressed a hot knife into it. I screamed and forced myself forward.

Fabric tore. Skin tore. Warmth spilled down my back.

Then I was falling.

I slammed onto the ground outside on my side, knocked breathless.

The building loomed over me. The window I’d just come through gaped, jagged. Nothing moved in the dark behind it.

For a moment, I thought I’d made it.

Then something pale pressed against the inside of the opening.

A raw, lipless grin.

“New skin…” the Skinned Man crooned from inside the wall. “The hollow is still my den.”

I forced myself up. Blood soaked my hoodie around my left shoulder, hot and sticky. When I touched it, my fingers came away bright red, and pain screamed through the whole side of my body.

I ran.

Streets blurred. Storefronts, wrecked cars, dead signs. I caught flashes: graffiti reading WE TRIED THE DOOR / IT OPENED; a camera smashed on the sidewalk; a jacket caught on a fence, sleeve ripped off.

The dragging sound came again, somewhere behind me. Metal or bone on pavement. Slow. Patient.

I cut through another alley.

Trash cans on their sides, a reeking dumpster, walls closing in. At the end of the alley, half buried in weeds, sat an old blue sedan, windows grimy but intact, tires flat, driver’s door ajar.

I went for it.

I slipped inside, pulled the door shut as quietly as I could. The latch caught. The car smelled like dust and old fabric and something sweet and rotten.

I scrambled into the back and slid onto the floor behind the front seats, curling up as small as I could get. My shoulder throbbed. Blood soaked into the carpet.

Outside, the dragging sound passed the alley mouth. Pause. Move. Come back.

My heart pounded so hard the whole car felt like it was shaking.

I pulled out my phone.

No signal. Battery in the low twenties. Screen cracked.

I opened the notes app and started typing.

I wrote about Mason’s text. The coordinates. The thread. The noises in my house. Cinder Hollow. The church. The basement. The wall of meat. Mason’s face. The Skinned Man.

Every few lines, I stopped and listened.

Once, something bumped the rear of the car. The whole frame shuddered. Rust drifted down.

“New skin…” its voice floated through the metal. “Hiding in dead metal bones. Little mouse in a rusted shell…”

The driver’s handle rattled once, then stilled.

I held my breath until spots danced in my vision.

If anyone ever reads this—if my phone somehow sends this when I’m not looking, or someone finds this car and scrolls through the notes—please don’t treat it like a story.

Don’t tell the kid in your house that it’s “just pipes” or “just the wind” when he says something is walking over his bed at night. Don’t joke about too much internet when he tells you something he read won’t leave his head.

Listen.

Because if my dad had known what was pacing over my ceiling, what was whispering through the walls, what was waiting at the end of a road with no name, maybe I wouldn’t be curled up on the floor of a dead car in a dead town, bleeding through my clothes while something without skin sniffs at the doors.

The roof above me dents inward with a slow, deep groan.

Bone presses the metal down, leaving a small, round bulge inches from my face.

“Found you,” the Skinned Man whispers through the roof. Its voice vibrates in my teeth.

My phone shakes in my hand.

Battery at 18%.

No service.

I’m going to hit save now, even if it never sends. Maybe this will sit here forever. Maybe somebody will find it. Maybe it’ll just be one more ghost file on a dead device.

If you see anything online about Cinder Hollow, a thread asking where the skin went, or coordinates like the ones Mason sent me—if a kid named Luke ever shows up on a missing poster—

Please.

Period. 

I’ve had so much trouble ordering an iced cortado. 90% of the time, the shop either refuses to do it because they only make it hot with steamed milk, or they just make me an iced latte without telling me that’s what they’ll be doing.

From reviewing this and other subs, it seems the primary reasons for this are that baristas believe that (a) a cortado, by definition, can only be made with steamed milk and (b) most customers don’t actually know what they’re ordering so they complain when they get a cup that isn’t full. But there are multiple problems with this line of reasoning.

If the shop makes iced lattes with 8+ ounces of milk and specialty syrups and foams (as almost all coffee shops do), it’s incredibly hypocritical and arbitrary to draw the line at a cortado made with cold milk instead of steamed milk. You’re already not making purely “traditional” café drinks. There is functionally no difference at that point between making an iced cortado and an iced latte, other the than milk to espresso ratio. 

It’s also highly problematic to assume you know what the customer wants instead of what they ordered. If you’re worried the customer doesn’t know what a cortado is, and you don’t have an appropriately sized cold cup, it makes much more sense to clarify with them that the volume will be much less than a latte, rather than just making a latte assuming that’s what the customer “actually” wants. Doing this just further perpetuates confusion regarding various espresso drinks. Personally, I’ve just stopped going to shops that serve me an iced latte when I asked for an iced cortado, because I just assume the people behind the counter have no idea what the drinks on the menu are.

As for why I order an iced cortado—-it’s hot where I live. That should be a good enough reason as any. My alternative now is to ask for two shots of espresso over ice with 2 oz of milk. When I’m at home, I make two shots of espresso, add 2 oz of cold milk, a small splash of simple syrup, and then froth.",0,1764520993.0,espresso,32,0.18,False

Daisy Shaw

Everyone in Chicago knew Ryland Pickwick, the notorious arms dealer, was a loose cannon.

He was bloodthirsty, cruel, and he loved to hold a blood-stained dagger to his opponent's throat whenever he played cards.

Lately, a rich man's illegitimate daughter caught his fancy, and their wedding was set for next week.

My fiancé, Harrison Pickwick, caught wind of it and disappeared for three days.

When I finally tracked him down, I overheard his conversation with his right-hand man.

""On the wedding day, deploy all our men to keep Anna safe and send Judy over in her place.

""I can't let Anna marry that psycho. Every woman he toyed with ended up broken.""

His right-hand man muttered, ""Rest assured, boss. It's all fixed.

""But... What about Ms. Hansen? If Ryland discovers that the bride has been switched, will he...""

Harrison snorted.

""What's there to be afraid of? He wouldn't dare to touch my girl.

""After the heat dies down, I'll divorce Anna and hold a fancier wedding for Judy.""

I stood outside, frozen to the core.

Turned out the love of my life had fallen for someone else.

I decided to go along with his plan. Yet once the swap was made, Harrison broke into tears.

***

After Harrison finished speaking, a woman's quiet sobs echoed through the private room.

Only then did I notice Anabella Ridgeway's presence. She sank into the leather sofa, her eyes rimmed with red, like a frightened kitty.

""Harry, it's not worth the risk! Ryland Pickwick is gonna kill you...""

Harrison brushed her tears away with his fingertip, his voice sweeter than honey. ""Rest assured. Fear is never in my dictionary.""

Then he chuckled, slipped his arm around her waist, and pulled her in. ""If you wanna thank me, just give me a bunch of kids.""

The people in the room instantly erupted in cheers and whistles.

Anabella's face flushed red as she buried her head into Harrison's arms.

""But, what about Ms. Hansen?""

""Judith?"" Harrison tittered. ""She's crazy about me. Even if she finds out, she'll forgive me after a few sweet nothings.""

His men chimed in, ""Mr. Pickwick is right! Ms. Hansen never says no to him!

""She wouldn't mind such a trifle.""

""Yeah. Everyone knows that she's hell-bent on marrying Mr. Pickwick.""

""Mr. Pickwick, you're so lucky. You get to marry the sweet Anabella, and the elegant Ms. Hansen is also waiting to be your bride.

""I wonder who you prefer, though.""

Harrison didn't respond. He pulled out a velvet box from his suit pocket, revealing a ruby ring.

It was the Pickwick family's heirloom, handed down to every bride through generations.

Under everyone's gaze, Harrison slid the ring onto Anabella's ring finger.

His action was enough to prove his determination to marry her.

Taken aback, Anabella tried to pull away, but he held her tightly.

""Since you will walk down the aisle with me, this ring belongs to you.""

Then he rubbed the ring and whispered, ""Don't let Judith see it. She may be compliant, but she's perceptive and paranoid.""

I stood outside the door, gazing at the ring, a bitter smile tugging at my lips.

Harrison's mother gave me that ring on her deathbed. It was a symbol of the Pickwick family's century-long heritage

Since we weren't officially married, I felt it was improper to wear it.

But three days ago, Harrison showed up at my apartment at midnight, saying he needed the ring for the ceremony.

So I opened the safe and gave him that ring.

I never once expected that the ceremony was meant for someone else.

I dashed out the door, straight into the pouring rain.

Bullets of rain pelted my body, wrenching my mind back to the night seven years ago.

My family and the Pickwicks had been close for generations.

Later, when they got into trouble, my father often secretly gave them financial help.

One day, the Pickwicks' sworn enemies found us. My mother hid me in the basement.

I could do nothing but watch as they brutally murdered my parents.

My father's blood squirted in my eyes, blurring my vision.

When reinforcements from the Pickwick family arrived, Harrison was the first to find me.

I bit him and kicked him like crazy, my nails raking his arm and leaving trails of blood. But he held me tightly until I blacked out, like he couldn't feel the pain.

In the wake of the upheaval, Hector Pickwick, Harrison's father, took me in and raised me out of gratitude.

Harrison brought me wherever he went. He saved me from the nightmares that haunted me and the vengeful rage that had once consumed me.

I grew deeply attached to him. I went to school and trained with him, stuck by him through thick and thin.

I thought we would stand by each other forever, never expecting that someone else would take my place.

If that was what he wanted, I would honor his choice.

When Harrison left the club, the rain was still falling. I had been sitting in the lobby the whole time.

The moment he caught sight of me, he let go of Anabella's hand, sprang behind me, and covered my eyes like he did when we were teens.

""Guess who I am.""

I yanked his hand away. ""It's not fun.""

With a chuckle, he casually draped his arm over my shoulder and caressed my cheek.

""Look at you, so ballsy! Aren't you afraid it'll be some perv?""

I said nothing, my gaze sweeping over Anabella and the troop of men behind him.

They didn't seem to worry that I had seen what just happened at all.

Because they knew I would always compromise with Harrison.

Harrison stepped between us, obscuring my sight. ""Did you come here looking for me?""

I nodded. ""The rain was heavy. I came here to take shelter.""

He took my hand like he'd done a million times, rubbing it in his palms to warm it up.

""You said you liked that exclusive Tiffany diamond bracelet, right? I forgot to tell you that I made a special trip to Los Angeles to get it for you.""

""Where's the bracelet then?"" I asked.

He cast Anabella a glance. ""It's a custom piece. I made a few tweaks to the design. So ... it won't be finished until the wedding's over.""

I forced a smile but said noth

While waiting for the car, Anabella suddenly let out a cry-her bracelet had hooked onto a nearby ornament.

With a forceful tug, the bracelet snapped and hit the marble ground, shining diamonds scattering in all directions.

It was the exact bracelet that I yearned for. There were only three in the world. I had mentioned it to Harrison several times.

He never bothered to buy it for me, and now, it was actually on someone else's wrist.

In a panic, Anabella crouched to pick them up, but a splinter of diamond cut her finger.

""Ouch!""

Blood oozed out. Harrison immediately released me and strode toward her.

""How can you be so careless?""

He swiftly removed his suit jacket and placed it over Anabella's shoulder. Then he used his tie to staunch the flow of blood.

I had given Harrison that tie as a birthday gift. He treasured it and treated it with meticulous care. Yet now, it was smeared with blood.

When he caught me staring, a shadow of guilt crossed his face.

""Judy, I'll take Anna to the clinic. You go in. I'll be back to get you.""

Before I could answer, he half-carried Anabella and climbed into the car.

To ease the tension, his men chimed in, ""Ms. Ridgeway helped Mr. Pickwick before. So he's returning the favor. Don't take it to heart. Do you want us to

give you a ride?""

I shook my head and told them to leave.

I just wanted to see if Harrison would keep his promise.

The night fell. Even when Hector called me and urged me to come home, Harrison was still nowhere in sight.

The next morning, he rushed into the villa. Seeing me sitting at the dining table set his mind at ease.

""Sorry, Judy. The car had a blowout. We were in the middle of nowhere with no phone signal. That's why I couldn't make it back for you."" 

I didn't listen to a single word he said.

My gaze was locked onto the hickey on his neck.

I reached for it, as though to expose his lies, but Harrison recoiled, adjusting the awkward scarf higher.

I looked down, digging my nails into my palm to fight back the tears.

""Your scarf looks out of place. I'll fix it for you.""

""No!"" He jumped at my words, then quickly changed the topic. ""Speaking of which, don't you need a diamond for the wedding veil? Let's go to the jewelry store and choose it now.""

As he spoke, he hurried to the car and waited for me.

I chuckled bitterly, tears rolling down my face.

By the time I changed clothes and stepped outside, the scarf was neatly fastened around his neck.

As the car pulled up to the jewelry store, a commotion reached us from inside.

I looked up at the VIP room on the second floor, and through the glass, I saw Anabella again.

Her face was streaked with tears, and a circle of rich women pushed and shoved her.

Harrison clenched his fists, his jaw tight, his gaze fixed on the second floor.

But he fought his urge to bolt upstairs and turned his gaze toward me.

I knew he wanted me to save Anabella's skin again.

This wasn't the first time.

Quite a few socialites didn't see eye to eye with Anabella.

Once, Anabella got pushed into the pool. Harrison jumped in and rescued her.

Afterwards, whenever she was in a jam, Harrison would always bail her out.

If he couldn't make an appearance, he let me handle it.

After the word got out that the casino tycoon, Ryland Pickwick, was going to marry Anabella, those ladies Fold Up green with envy. 

To catch Ryland's attention, they wouldn't hesitate to do plastic surgery and insert breast implants.

""Are you deaf? Take your clothes off! Let's see how big those titties are to enthrall the famous Ryland.""

""Please, don't do this. People are watching us.""

Anabella shook her head, tears gushing.

""Drop the innocent act! There's no way Ryland would know you got the goods if you hadn't flaunted them.

""If he can see them, why can't we?

""Will you take it off yourself, or should we help you?""

When Anabella was driven into a corner, Harrison nudged me.

""Judy, go!""

I staggered and almost fell.

But he was utterly fixated on Anabella and didn't notice that at all.

With a self-mocking curl of my lips, I headed to the second floor.

Seeing me, Anabella scuttled behind me and whispered shakily, ""Ms. Hansen, help...""

I glanced at the bullies and bellowed, ""How dare you make her strip in public? Aren't you afraid of being on tomorrow's front page?""

The leader, Elsie Thorp, smiled at me indifferently. ""Ms. Hansen, we're just curious. But take my advice, saint, either."" 

The leader, Elsie Thorp, smiled at me indifferently. ""Ms. Hansen, we're just curious. But take my advice, she's no saint, either.""

""Yeah, Ms. Hansen. I saw Mr. Pickwick take her to the hotel a few days ago. Isn't that suspicious?""

Anabella shook her head frantically.

""No! Ms. Hansen, don't listen to their nonsense!""

He clutched my arm and pulled me back. I couldn't break free even if I tried.

""Nonsense? You just don't have the guts to admit it!

""Yesterday, I even saw you two enter...""

Before she could finish, Anabella screamed and tumbled backward over the railing!

""Anna!""

Harrison lunged forward and caught her. They crashed to the ground together.

""Anna, are you all right? Did you get hurt?""

It took Anabella a moment to recover from the shock. She slowly looked up at me, tears pouring. ""Ms. Hansen, why did you push me? Did you really believe their lies?""

Harrison lifted his head, his gaze sharp and cold.

""Judith! I asked you to save her, not the other way around!""

Catching the flicker of satisfaction in Anabella's eyes, I suddenly understood why she had been pulling my arm.

""She jumped herself.""

She hung her head, her eyes rimmed with red, and she said timidly, ""It's my fault. I fell by accident...""

She trembled all over, looking pitiful and vulnerable.

Harrison cradled her, his heart full of sympathy.

""I saw everything clearly from below! You nudged her! And you still try to deny it?""

Meeting his scornful eyes, I realized that arguing was pointless.

Anabella staged the whole scene herself, and he wouldn't believe a word I said.

""If anything happens to her, I will never forgive you.""

With that, he ignored everyone, scooped Anabella up in his arms, and strode out of the jewelry store.

Before leaving, Anabella raised her brows at me and smiled triumphantly. I wasn't the only one who saw that smile. Elsie and her friends saw it, too.

Gnashing her teeth, Elsie thundered, ""That bitch! I knew she did it on purpose!

""Ms. Hansen, Mr. Pickwick is engaged to you. How dare she go after him? Don't you...""

She left the rest unsaid, probably convinced by those rumors that I was spineless.

Back at the villa, before I could even take a seat, Harrison stormed in.

He seized my wrist and dragged me toward the door. ""Anna is in the hospital because of you. Go apologize.""

I jerked my hand free and met his cold eyes.

""I said I didn't push her. Why should I apologize?""

""I believe what I saw. Judy, don't test my patience.""

With that, he produced my father's ring, the only keepsake I had of him.

When we got engaged, I gave it to him as a token of our love. It was the thing that I cherished most.

My heart sank as a chill ran through me.

""You're gonna threaten me 

""Not threaten. As long as you apologize, everything will go back to the way it was.""

I laughed, tears rolling down my cheeks.

I looked away, quickly wiped my tears, and swallowed hard. ""Fine. I'll go. But once I apologize, give me back my ring.""

Harrison paused. He opened his mouth, but the words died in his throat. In the end, he gave a reluctant nod.

Anabella was placed in the Pickwick family's private hospital. She was now curling up in the bed and weeping quietly.

The sight of me gave her quite a start.

""I'm sorry.""

After saying that, I stared at Harrison.

He held Anabella by the shoulders and said coldly, ""Apologize on your knees.""

I gawked at him in disbelief, my heart desolate.

I sank to my knees and repeated the words. ""I'm sorry.""

Anabella tried to rise from the bed as if to help me up, but Harrison stopped her.

""She owes you an apology. Rest up. Nothing can go wrong at the wedding.""

He didn't even bother to lie.

I stood up, snatched the ring from his hand, and turned to leave.

No matter how he shouted my name, I marched ahead, steadfast.

We hadn't come across each other again until the wedding day.

After all the formalities, he sent me into the wedding car and whispered, ""No matter what happens, don't freak out. I'll come to get you later.""

I stayed quiet.

After circling the city, the car suddenly stopped on the bridge.

About ten minutes later, it started moving again.

But I sensed the route had changed. It didn't head to the Pickwick's villa, but to Ryland's manor in the south.

When the car halted, my heart clenched.

As Hector's illegitimate son, Ryland was never acknowledged by the family and grew up in the slums.

He was ruthless. He clawed his way up from the bottom, conquered, and took over several rival gangs.

Feared by every gangster, he became known as the ""King of Gambling.""

I had met him a few times. He always struck me as cold and unapproachable.

As the car door opened, he looked at me without a trace of surprise. Instead, he flashed a grin and asked, ""You're here? Are you hungry?""

""Why weren't you surprised to see me?""

""Were you not the same?""

I was so nervous that I forgot to pretend.

Ryland chuckled. ""Do you want to go back to Harrison?""

I shook my head.

""From now on, you're my wife.""

Hand in hand, we walked up the red carpet. The wedding eclipsed the one the Pickwick family held, but the guests were surprisingly sparse.

Most were his brothers from the gang.

During the ceremony, Ryland kissed me. I didn't resist and let him deepen the kiss.

That night, he claimed me like a ravenous beast. His thirst was almost unquenched.

His hot breath grazed my ear as I whimpered and attempted to run, but he gripped my ankle and hauled me back.

All night, no matter how I begged, he refused to stop.

Not until the sun rose did he pat my back and coax me to sleep.

Yet I had barely closed my eyes when I heard Harrison's furious roar. ""Already married? That's a load of bull!""

He kicked the door open and stormed in.

Harrison charged into the bedroom, his eyes blazing red. ""Ryland! Where's my wife? I'm taking her home!""

Ryland swiftly wrapped me in the blanket and stood before the bed.

""What's your problem? Shouldn't your wife be at home? Stop making a scene here!""

""There was a mix-up yesterday! Judith was sent to you! Where is she? Which room?""

Seeing Harrison so anxious, Ryland smirked and deliberately revealed the scratch marks on his back.

Harrison's eyes widened in shock as he fixated on the scratch marks. ""You...""

His words were caught in his throat, his heart raced, and his gaze wandered to the giant bed draped in dark curtains.

""My wife sleeps in my bed. Duh! Who would put their wife in the guest room?""

Harrison's lips quivered. He couldn't force a single word out.

I chimed in at the right moment, my voice raspy from sleep. ""Sweetheart, who's there?""

That came like a bolt from the blue, and Harrison staggered, almost losing his balance.

The butler rushed to steady Harrison, but Harrison shoved him aside. He hissed, ""Piss off! Don't touch me!""

Harrison snapped his head toward Ryland and glared at him. ""Ryland! You know what she means to me! How dare you defile her?

""Judy, it's me! Talk to me, Judy! Did he force you?""

He lunged forward, but Ryland kicked him in the stomach. He grunted and stumbled backward.

""Harrison, don't flip out on me!""

Ryland's words dripped with disdain.

""Besides, you know who's behind this, don't you?""

Harrison gritted his teeth, his eyes burning with fury. ""You've known it all along?""

Ryland offered no reply, only a cold smirk playing on his lips.

""Get out!""

""I won't leave without her!""

Harrison lunged forward again, grappling with Ryland. Both went for the kill. Within moments, Harrison's face was marked with bruises and blood.

By the time I threw on my robe and rushed out, Ryland had already pinned Harrison against the wall, twisting his arm behind his back.

But the moment Harrison saw me, he thrashed violently. ""Judy! Judy, come here! I'll take you home!""

His eyes sparkled with a feverish mix of hope and desperation, as if he truly cared about me.

I watched him serenely. ""What about Anabella? What do you plan to do with her?""

Harrison's smile vanished.

""Last time, I was drunk. I mistook her for you. It was too late.

""But I'll take care of it! You're the only woman I'll ever call wife! I'll make her move out. She won't come between us again!""

I cut him short. ""That won't be necessary. I won't go back.""

""Nonsense!""

He snapped, ""How am I going to tell my father? And my mother? Before she passed, she entrusted that family heirloom to...""

I laughed bitterly. ""What's the point of telling me this now? Didn't you put that ruby ring on Anabella's finger yourself?""

Harrison blanched. He didn't expect me to know this.

""The night at the casino, I heard everything, yet I still played along with you. Call it even now.

""You should leave.""

Words failed him. He finally realized why I had been acting strangely over the past few days.

I walked up to Ryland, touched the split corner of his lips, and asked softly, ""Does it hurt? I'll fetch the first-aid kit.""

He grabbed my wrist. When he was about to lead me back to the room, Hector and his men arrived. 

Seeing me with Ryland, Hector turned livid. His finger trembled as he pointed at Ryland. ""Brat! That's your sister-in-law! How could you? Alas!""

Hector's presence gave Harrison some hope. He shouted, ""Dad, dad! Judy is my wife! She should be mine!""

""Don't worry. I'll set this right for you!""

I looked at Ryland. Though his face registered composure, his hands behind him were clenched.

I gently took his hand and met Hector's gaze. ""Sir, Harrison orchestrated this to marry Anabella. It has nothing to do with Ryland.""

""What? What are you talking about?"" Hector was clearly in the dark, convinced it was all by Ryland's design.

I added, ""If you don't believe me, you can check with Anabella and see if she's wearing the Pickwick family's ruby ring.""

Hector shot Harrison a glare. ""Is that true? Did you do it?""

Harrison closed his eyes and sank to his knees.

""Yes, it was all my doing. I can't bear to watch Anna marry a degenerate like Ryland! That's why I went to such lengths!

""But Judy, I have never given up on you! Come back with me now, and we can sweep this under the rug!""

As soon as he finished talking, Hector kicked him hard.

""Bastard! That marriage was arranged long ago! How dare you mess it up!""

Hector turned to me and said, ""But good thing that no one knows it yet. Judy, come home with us. I'll make it up to you!

""I'll send that Anabella away immediately and right all the wrongs done to you!""

Hector's plea felt genuine. He truly wanted me back. For all these years, he had been treating me like his future daughter-in-law.

Noticing my silence, Ryland tightened his grip, as if afraid I might say yes.

No way I would do that.

""Sir, forgive me, but Ryland is also your son. I'm willing to marry him.""

""My dear, don't talk nonsense! He's nothing but an illegitimate son. How could he ever be good enough for you?""

""But I'm just an orphan. You took me in out of your kindness. Since Harrison carries a torch for Anabella, I'll let them be together. It's for the best.""

Hector sighed, staring daggers at Harrison, then kicked him again. ""Brat! Look what you have done!

""Before this blows out of proportion, get rid of that girl right now!""

The butler chimed in, ""I'm afraid it's too late. The news has traveled far and wide.""


""What?"" Harrison jerked his head up, bewildered.

He had originally planned to bring me back and leak the news to humiliate Ryland.

But now, things had gotten out of hand. He might never get the chance to bring me back.

It wasn't until this moment that he completely lost his bearings.

Watching me holding hands with Ryland, he kept shaking his head, tears streaming down his face. ""No, Judy! You can't stay here! You can't!

""If you don't leave now, there will be no turning back!""

I stayed quiet, rubbing my temples and whispering to Ryland, ""Sweetheart, my head hurts. I'd like to return to our room and lie down.""

Ryland gestured for the maid to escort me out.

""Judy! Judy!"" Harrison wanted to follow, but the bodyguard stopped him cold.

Frustrated, Hector shot Ryland a stare and said austerely, ""Get your brother back now!""

No matter how fiercely Harrison fought, it was all in vain.

That evening, while I tended to Ryland's wounds, he furrowed his brows and seemed to have a lot on his mind.

I turned to fetch the first-aid kit, but he pulled me back and had me sit on his lap.

His spontaneous action caught me off guard, leaving me unsure what to do.

Just as I was about to rise, he murmured, ""Seven years ago, I was the one who found you first, not Harrison.""

I was utterly dumbfounded. ""What did you just say?""

He rolled up his sleeve, revealing a tooth-bite-shaped old scar on his forearm.

I touched the scar with shaky fingers, my heart hammering in my chest. ""How could it be you?""

""Back then, I had just made a name for myself in underground boxing, but Hector summoned me back to work for him. I was the first to break into your house that night.

""I carried you out of the basement.

When you asked my name, I didn't tell you.

""I didn't think that you would mistake me for Harrison.""

I frowned slightly and examined Ryland's face, my finger gently tracing the scar beneath his brow.

I had long noticed that Harrison had no scar on his face, and I figured that I remembered it wrong.

""That'll explain it. Whenever I ask Harrison about that night, he always gives me the runaround. I thought he was trying to spare my feelings. It turned out he didn't know.

""Why didn't you tell me the truth later?""

He replied, ""You were certain it was him, and you liked him so much. I didn't see the point of bringing it up. Besides, it was just a brief encounter in the chaos.""

I slowly shook my head, cupped his face, and met his gaze. ""No, it's not. If you hadn't found me that night, I would have died in that basement.""

He held the back of my head, pulled me close, and kissed me affectionately.

But then, I gently pushed him back, my voice tinged with a hint of curiosity and jealousy. ""But, why did you marry Anabella?""

Seeing my stern face, Ryland chuckled.

""That was just an excuse to brush off those people trying to set me up with a date.

""As for Anabella, she shares a past with Harrison. Now, with your wedding coming up, I can't just sit back and do nothing.

""So, I thought I would test Harrison. See how he will respond if I ask to marry Anabella.

""To my surprise, he pulled a switcheroo, so I played his game and let you unwittingly deliver you to me.""

I froze, struggling to wrap my head around it.

""No wonder you weren't surprised to see me.""

""You were no different,"" he said with a smirk. ""I know who I will be marrying. So do you. It lines up perfectly, doesn't it?""

We changed a smile, sharing a tacit acknowledgment of everything.

When Harrison reached the Pickwick's villa, the front gate was teeming with people, including the Ridgeways.

The Ridgeways didn't object to the marriage swap.

Although Ryland was currently more popular, Harrison and he were still brothers. 

For them, their goal was to forge an alliance with the Pickwicks, so it didn't matter which son their daughter was betrothed to.

Caleb Pickwick couldn't stop praising, ""Anna is truly fortunate to be marrying you!

""You're so young and successful. Anna could not have hoped for a better match! We fully support this marriage!""

Harrison forced a smile. He had no desire to indulge them.

Seeing Harrison distracted, Anabella wanted to speak, but Hector cut her off. ""Our first choice for marriage had been Judy. But since the deed is done, we won't fuss over it. Let it be a lesson for Harrison's waywardness and keep your daughter away from us for now.""

Anabella sprang to her feet. ""What?""

Before she could defend herself, Caleb thundered, ""The adults are speaking! Don't interrupt!""

He turned to Hector with an obsequious smile. ""Sir Pickwick, forgive my daughter! We have no objections. The Pickwick family is distinguished, and a wife like Ms. Hansen befits Harrison perfectly.""

But Anabella didn't agree to it. She elbowed Harrison, hoping he could stick up for her.

As she moved, the ruby ring on her wrist slipped into view, and Hector happened to see it.

His face instantly darkened. He smacked the coffee table and fumed, ""Some, take that ring off Ms. Ridgeway's finger.""

Biting her lips, Anabella nudged Harrison again. ""Harry, you promised that this ring...""

""Take it off, Anna."" Harrison shut his eyes wearily. ""I'll buy you a better one.""

Before Anabella could react, the bodyguards stepped up, deftly removed the ring, polished it, and placed it in Hector's hand.

After the Ridgeways left, the scandal became the talk of the town.

At the charity dinner, we naturally became the center of attention.

Harrison looked at me openly, and I averted my gaze.

By accident, a waiter spilled wine on my dress. As I went to the lounge to tidy up, Harrison trailed after me.

He blocked my path and presented a diamond bracelet.

""Judy...""

I cut him short. ""Do you think I need this now?""

His face turned pale as he stubbornly held his hand out.

""Judy, I'm sorry for what I did to you, but you can't be with Ryland! He's unworthy of you!

""Come with me. Give me a chance to make it up to you. Please?""

With that, he leaned in to put the bracelet around my wrist.

But I thrust my hand away. The bracelet fell onto the marble floor, shattering into pieces as it had at the club that day.

He froze to the spot, tears welling up in his eyes.

I smiled faintly.

""This bracelet looks better on Anabella.""

Harrison knew exactly what I meant. His face went even paler, etched with pure shame.

He was about to speak when a shrill argument broke out nearby.

Martha Vyner, the Vyner Group heiress who'd always been hung up on Ryland, had cornered Anabella on the patio with Elsie and a couple of her lackeys.

""If you hadn't butted in, I'd at least have had a chance! Now that Ms. Hansen is married to Ryland, what am I supposed to do?""

Martha tried to shove Anabella, but Anabella smacked her hand away.

""I'm Mrs. Pickwick now! Go ahead and lay a finger on me! I dare you!""

""Bitch! Aren't you scared I'll spill all your dirty secrets to Mr. Pickwick?""

""Ryland and I are rock solid. Nothing you say could come between us!"" Anabella shot back.

As soon as Anabella finished speaking, Elsie lunged forward and slapped her hard across the face!

Harrison instinctively moved to intervene, but Elsie's roar stopped him cold. ""We all saw you fake that fall at the jewelry store to frame Ms. Hansen that day!

""Lately, Mr. Pickwick's been sending lavish gifts to Ryland's villa just to win Ms. Hansen's forgiveness. Even when she throws it out, he keeps coming back! You think he'll still want you once he finds out the truth?"" 

That sent Anabella over the edge. ""So what?"" she shrieked. ""I got him to stay once. I can do it again!""

""You have no shame! First, you stole my fiancé because you thought his family connections were better than yours! The second his family got investigated, you cut ties with him right away. You almost drove him to kill himself over you!

""A while back, you didn't think the professor's son your family picked for you had a promising future, so you faked drowning to latch onto Mr. Pickwick. You ruined his relationship with Ms. Hansen for good! This is all on you! I'm gonna make sure Mr. Pickwick finds out today!""

Elsie turned to leave after that, but Anabella pounced and grabbed her by the hair!

""Bitch! I fought for what's mine. Who do you think you are to ruin me?""

She went crazy, hitting and scratching Elsie like a maniac. Martha and the others tried to pull her off, only to get scratched and bloodied themselves.

At that moment, Anabella didn't look even a little bit as delicate as she usually did.

""Anabella, are you out of your mind? You dared to hit me?""

""So what? Harry's got my back!""

With that, she kicked Elsie, who was now on the ground, and then threw herself into the nearby ornamental pond, screaming for help.

Harrison and I watched every single second of this.

I let out a scoff and turned to leave, but a heavy thud came from behind me.

Harrison had dropped to his knees right in front of me.

""Judy..."" His voice trembled. ""So, that's the truth... I've been blind this whole time.""

I turned and looked down at him, a sneer tugging at my lips. ""It's too late for apologies, Mr. Pickwick. Take care.""

Back in the hall, I ran into Ryland, who'd been looking for me.

I filled him in on what just happened, and as I spoke, security brought up Martha, Elsie, and Anabella.

Some had scratched-up faces, and others had messy hair.

Anabella got the worst of it. She was carried up on a stretcher, soaking wet and unconscious from swallowing so much water.

That night, the Pickwick family was thrown into utter chaos.

After they got back, Anabella was put under house arrest.

When she woke up, she had no clue what was going on and threw a fit demanding to see Harrison, only to be hit with proof that she was the one who started the rumors about the wedding swap. 

Harrison slammed the divorce papers in front of her right then and there, and Anabella passed out from anger.

She was sent back to the Ridgeway family before long and ended up in Elsie's hands.

Word got around that her dad married her off to an old, rich guy with weird kinks.

Ryland had just finished telling me all this when the butler came to announce, ""Mr. Pickwick is here. He's heading to the Middle East to handle the family business and wanted to say goodbye.""

""No need for that,"" I smiled faintly. ""Tell him he can come to the party after September.""

The butler froze for a second, then laughed and left.

Ryland was confused. ""After September? Is that your birthday?""

I just smiled without answering and got up to leave.

Suddenly, it clicked. His eyes lit up instantly! Ryland laughed heartily, caught up to me in a few strides, and scooped me up into his arms, his entire being radiating unrestrained joy.

I can't....,"So, I met this girl in my 10th grade tuition classes, pretty pretty, but I for myself didn't care enough to talk to her, but she used to talk to me all the time, always starting convos, online and offline, so this went on for a year and a half, so one fine day, I was just going around minding my own business, daydreaming about completing my 11th grade syllabus and this girl, comes out of nowhere, and proposes to me, in a very dramatic way, lets not go into details about that. So, she proposed to me on 24th august 2023, and oh GOD it was HEAVEN.  
Like complete mutual obsession, no fucks given to anyone else, enough for each other, always fighting over silly things(not srs), but patching up quick. Then one fine day of 4th september 2024, girl called me for coffee, like a very normal date, but when I was about to leave, and we hugged as usual, she didn't seem to want to let go, and when I said ""gtg, mom doesn't know"", she said ""5 more minutes please ?"" but nah, I didn't wait. Biggest regret of my  life. I went to school on the 5th, Teacher's day, full on party mode, but when I come back home, I come to know that she suicided, idk the reason, no note  was ever found, I went to her home, her body had just been returned after postmortem, and in her house's hall, there she was, covered from head to toe in a white cloth, I went up to her face, to look at her one last time, I wasn't crying till then, I was just dizzy as fuck, and my head hurt like hell, then I lifted the cloth, and her face, as tender and as beautiful as ever, but paler than a ghost and oh her nostrils closed with cotton, I got terrified, not in the way I would if I saw a ghost, and I  started crying, and according to her parents, I had fainted, because when I woke up, it was 2 hours later than I had arrived at her house, and apart from their homeservice, no one was there, she was gone. Forever. Never coming back.

So, till date, I never really moved on, I don't even look at other girls, let alone talk to them, I managed to control my emotions and now I don't have to stay sad in front of people anymore but all this acting is tiring me out, I have had multiples breakdowns and I have been listening to ""the night we met"" on repeat even when I don't want to. I just want to hug someone and cry it out, but who do I tell all this. I used to call some people ""friends"" but when I was just a step away from suiciding myself, all I got from 90% of them was, ""move on buddy, its already been a year"" yes BITCH, ik its been an year, its not like I enjoy suffering. and the remaning 10% who seemed to be helping, I don't want to go to them either, I don't want to be labelled as an attention seeker, I don't trust anyone enough anymore because the one I used to trust, and could bet my life on, surprisingly came in the 90%. Idk anymore man, feeling that alan walker song, ""we all need that someone who gets you like no one else, right when you need it the most, we all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on, a friend through the highs and the lows"", I don't have someone like that, YES, I have been that someone in many people's lives but for me, no one, literally no one, not a fucking person from people I used to call ""friends"". I am not sure what to do, I am not suicidal, at least not anymore, but I am so hurt, first her and then my 'friends'. Life can be shitty sometimes, Idk if I will ever move on from this.

My name is Luke. I’m seventeen. If anyone finds this and doesn’t just shrug it off as some creative writing assignment, please—please send someone to Cinder Hollow.

The numbers are out there. They were the last thing my friend sent me before he disappeared, and I was stupid enough to follow them.

I keep stopping because it sounds like something is dragging itself along the pavement outside. I don’t know how long I have, so I’m going to move fast.

It started with a text from Mason.

He worked nights for a delivery app. We’d text while he sat in his car between orders. Three weeks ago, at 10:47 p.m., my phone buzzed.

you ever heard of the skinned man?

I was in my room, lights off, TV on mute, scrolling.

is that a band or another cryptid you’re trying to scare me with

He didn’t answer. A minute later, my phone vibrated three times.

First: a link to some old, ugly forum.

Second: a screenshot of a thread titled Cinder Hollow / The Skinned Man (DO NOT GO THERE).

Third: a separate text.

40.8319, -78.3941

No “lol.” No explanation. Just coordinates.

what is this

No answer.

I tried calling. It rang twice, then went to voicemail. Not unusual. I figured he was driving. I fell asleep eventually.

The next morning, he wasn’t at school.

By lunch, everyone knew he hadn’t come home from his shift.

By the weekend, his mom had flyers up. The news ran a short segment. “Last seen making deliveries in the late evening.” They showed a generic shot of a car with the delivery logo. They talked about his “last known route.”

They didn’t mention the coordinates.

Nobody knew he’d sent them to me.

I clicked the link.

The forum looked ancient—black background, gray text, no avatars. The original poster of the thread had deleted their account. Their post described an abandoned town in the woods off a forgotten stretch of highway in Pennsylvania. No signs. No services. A church. A basement. A well that “went down wrong.” Flesh on the walls, “still talking.”

They called it Cinder Hollow.

They talked about something they called the Skinned Man.

Most replies were jokes and arguments. But a few accounts didn’t comment anywhere else, and they all said some version of the same thing:

where did our skin go

Buried halfway down the thread, I found Mason’s numbers.

40.8319, -78.3941

Underneath, someone had written:

it’s the church u have to go down in the church

That user never posted again.

When I clicked the coordinates, my maps app dropped a pin in the middle of a huge patch of green. Zoom in: trees, a thin gray line that might be a road. Zoom out: no town name. No labels.

That was the night the noises in my house started.

I woke up around three to the sound of footsteps above my room.

Our house is one story with an unfinished attic. No one goes up there except my dad once a year. There is no reason for anyone to be walking around overhead.

Soft, careful steps. A creak. A pause, like whoever was up there had stopped to listen.

The air in my room felt heavy. I told myself it was the house settling. Old wood. Temperature drop.

Then something scraped across the ceiling. Slowly. Like a heavy bag being dragged.

The steps passed directly over my bed.

I lay there with my eyes open, staring at the dark, counting my breaths until the house went quiet again.

In the morning, Dad looked tired over his coffee.

“You were up late,” he said. “Sounded like someone walking around. Neighbor texted me, said they thought they saw your light on at one.”

“I never got out of bed,” I said.

He shrugged. “House is old, Luke. Don’t overthink it.”

There it was—that little dismissive shrug I’d pictured. I didn’t mention the coordinates or the thread or the Skinned Man. Saying it out loud felt like daring him to call me crazy.

The noises came back the next night.

Sometimes footsteps. Sometimes light scratching. Once, three slow knocks from inside my closet wall. I’d wake up to find my bedroom door cracked open when I was sure I’d closed it. My desk chair angled a little toward my bed. The curtain caught in a way I didn’t remember.

I kept going back to the thread.

Most of the images were broken, but one blurry screenshot showed an empty street, trees leaning in, boarded buildings. Someone had circled a pale shape in an upper window. Another picture was nearly black; the caption just said:

basement. don’t go down if you hear them

Brightened, it was a gray smear with what might have been a ring of stones.

I started dreaming about a well.

I also kept thinking about stupid, ordinary things about Mason—him drumming on the steering wheel, stealing exactly two fries, the way he always wanted to push “just a little further” any time we explored someplace we shouldn’t.

He pushed too far without me this time.

That’s what finally made me go.

On Friday, I waited until Dad’s truck turned the corner for his double shift. The house settled into quiet. I grabbed my backpack.

Flashlight. Batteries. A folding knife from the junk drawer. Water. Hoodie. Phone charger. Battery pack.

I left a note on the counter.

Went to hang out with Josh. Back later. –L

The drive out of town felt normal. Same stores, same traffic, same stupid songs on the radio. I followed the GPS until it told me to turn onto what looked like nothing—just a thin break in the trees.

The road was cracked, half-eaten by weeds. Branches scraped the car. My signal dropped. Two bars. One. None.

The map froze with my little blue arrow pointed into blank green.

After a while, I passed a rusted-out car in a ditch, nose-down, a tree growing through its sunroof. Faded spray paint on the door read:

D N’T ST P

I drove on.

The trees opened up just enough to show me the remains of a town.

Cinder Hollow.

Main street, small square, a handful of two-story buildings. Most windows boarded or broken. Streetlights bent. A gas station with no pumps. A faded convenience store sign with no store beneath it.

I pulled in behind an SUV with every door hanging open and a pickup that had no bed.

When I stepped out, the silence punched me. No traffic, no planes, no dogs. Even the birds seemed to avoid the place.

The pavement was dusty and cracked. In that dust, I saw footprints. Several sets, different sizes, some sharp-edged, some half-faded.

People had been here.

More signs the further I went: a crushed water bottle with this year’s date on it; a backpack slumped under a collapsed awning; a tripod with no camera. A laundromat with all the washers pried open and forgotten clothes petrified in them. A barbershop, chair on its side, scissors on the floor.

On its door, scrawled in marker:

DON’T LET IT MEASURE YOU

I didn’t want to know what that meant.

A small playground sat behind a leaning fence. Chains swung with no seats. A single child’s sneaker lay on its side in the dirt.

At the end of the street, the town opened into a square.

The church stood in the middle.

Blackened stone walls, vines climbing up them. Broken steeple. Shattered stained glass. The double doors were closed. A red arrow had been spray painted on one door, pointing inward.

Under the arrow:

THIS IS WHERE THEY WENT DOWN

I stood at the bottom of the steps, staring. If Mason had come here, this is where he would have ended up.

Inside. Down.

I opened the door.

It groaned. Cold, sour air rolled out—wet stone, mold, and something metallic underneath.

Inside, light from broken windows showed crooked pews and a shattered altar. Empty water bottles and a dead flashlight lay near the back.

On the floor, words had been carved into the planks, deep and jagged:

NO WAY BACK ONCE YOU HEAR THEM

An arrow scratched next to the words pointed toward a side door behind the altar.

I followed it.

The side hall was narrow and dark. My flashlight-beam picked out peeling paint, old pipes, nothing else. It ended at a set of concrete stairs going down. Above the first step, someone had spray painted:

YOU REALLY DON’T HAVE TO DO THIS

They were right.

I thought about turning back. I also thought about that screenshot of the coordinates and the last message Mason ever sent me.

I went down.

The air got colder, wetter. It smelled like mold and pennies. My footsteps echoed.

Halfway, I heard the first voice.

“Help…”

Thin, strained, floating up from below.

Another voice joined it.

“Please… it hurts…”

Then more, overlapping. Different tones, different ages, all frayed.

“Don’t leave us…”

“Where did our skin go…”

That phrase, out loud, in multiple voices at once, made my stomach twist.

At the bottom of the stairs, the basement opened into a large room. Stone walls, low ceiling with pipes, cracked concrete floor.

And in the center, a well.

Waist-high ring of stones, rusted chain hanging over it. The rim was slick and dark, stained.

The voices weren’t coming from the well. They seeped from everywhere.

“Please…”

“Make it stop…”

My flashlight hit the far wall.

For a second I couldn’t understand what I was seeing.

The wall was coated in flesh.

Red muscle, white tendon, veins pulsing beneath a thin sheen of fluid. It climbed up the wall, across the ceiling, down toward the floor in folds and ropes.

Embedded in it were pieces of people.

Eyes, some open and rolling, some crusted shut. Mouths opening and closing, lips shredded, teeth exposed. Fingers poking out, flexing weakly before the meat swallowed them again. Half-formed faces pushed forward and sank back.

“Help us…” one mouth sobbed.

“Don’t leave…” another gurgled.

Hands reached out of the wall, skinless and shaking.

“Lu…ke…”

My name came from the center.

The mass bulged, reshaping. Eyes squeezed out of tissue, a mouth pulled itself open, features sliding into place in a way that made me want to be sick.

Freckles. Crooked front tooth. A mole near the right eye.

“Mason,” I said.

His eyes focused, bloodshot and too wide.

“It… hurts, man,” he rasped. His voice sounded wet and wrong. “Please… make it stop…”

Tissue pulled at his face every time he spoke, trying to drag him back in.

“I’m sorry,” I said. My throat burned.

“It talked to us,” he forced out. “Said we’d be warm. Said it didn’t waste anything. I thought it was just… an internet thing. Just wanted to see if it was real…”

He blinked hard. Tears mixed with whatever else slicked his face.

“Don’t let it take you too,” he whispered. “Don’t let it wear you…”

The rest of the wall whimpered.

“Where did our skin go…” someone keened overhead.

I stumbled back until I hit stone on the opposite side. My flashlight beam jerked toward where the stairwell had been.

There was no stairwell.

Just solid wall.

I slammed my free hand against it. Rough, damp stone met my palm. I clawed along the surface, searching for any seam.

Nothing.

“You can’t go,” a voice gibbered from the flesh. “No door. No up. Just down…”

Something laughed.

It vibrated through the floor, up my legs, into my teeth. It came from the well.

“New skin…” a voice crooned. Not from the wall. From everywhere. “New skin walked down all by himself. Didn’t even have to be chased.”

The chain over the well rattled and rose, like something was pulling it from below.

“Luke…” Mason gasped. “Run…”

“There’s nowhere to run in the den,” the other voice said, almost cheerful.

The chain stopped.

Something rose out of the darkness.

It came up in one smooth motion, like it was being pushed from underneath. A column of glistening red broke the surface and unfolded into limbs and torso.

No skin anywhere.

Bare muscle, wet and moving. Bones visible underneath. Tendons sliding. The head turned toward me: empty sockets full of twitching tissue, stripped nose, lipless grin full of yellow, human teeth arranged too wide.

Strips of dried skin hung from its shoulders like a cloak. Some tattooed, some small. One bore a faded delivery app logo.

“New skin,” it said. The sound was dozens of voices layered into one. “You heard the choir and came down. You opened the door.”

My legs wouldn’t move.

The Skinned Man stepped away from the well. With every movement, the muscles on its frame crawled, like they were still trying to decide where they belonged. The hanging skins rustled softly.

“Why?” I managed. “Why them?”

Its head tilted.

“Because they knocked,” it said. “They found the road. They followed the numbers. I answered. I like the curious ones. They always come alone.”

It lifted a hand. Bone hooks jutted from each finger.

“Don’t…” Mason croaked.

The Skinned Man turned toward his voice.

“You have so much to say,” it said. “You all do.”

It plunged its hand into the wall.

Every voice screamed.

The sound was one massive, tearing shriek. The meat writhed around its arm. Faces twisted. Hands spasmed. Dust rained down. My ears rang so hard I thought something in my head had ruptured.

The Skinned Man stirred its arm, then yanked it free. Strings of flesh clung and snapped back.

“See?” it said. “Still feeling. Still warm.”

That broke something loose in me.

I bolted.

I ran along the wall, away from the well, flashlight beam bouncing, shoes slipping on damp concrete. In the far corner, a low archway gaped between fallen stones.

I dove through, scraping my shoulders.

A narrow passage. Low ceiling. Pipes overhead dripping rusty water onto my neck. The air tasted like rot.

Behind me, its voice followed.

“Little mouse in the cracks,” it called. “My den is very old. I always find the cracks.”

A metal door sagged at the end of the passage, covered in deep scratches.

I hit it full force.

It shrieked open, and I stumbled into a smaller room with stone walls and a low ceiling. Collapsed shelves. Broken jars. And on the far wall, a stack of crates under a boarded-up window.

Light leaked through the gaps.

Real outside light.

The wall beside the door swelled outward, stone rippling.

I scrambled up the crates. They wobbled dangerously. I grabbed a board and yanked. It held. Splinters bit my palms. I braced my shoulder and pulled harder.

It cracked down the middle.

Cold air rushed in through the gap.

Behind me, stone split with a wet tearing sound. Fingers of bone pushed through.

“New skin wants the sky,” the Skinned Man hummed. “They always think the sky means out.”

I tore at the remaining boards. Wood snapped. Nails screamed. The opening widened.

I shoved myself through.

Broken wood scraped my arms and ribs. My injured shoulder hit the edge. It felt like someone pressed a hot knife into it. I screamed and forced myself forward.

Fabric tore. Skin tore. Warmth spilled down my back.

Then I was falling.

I slammed onto the ground outside on my side, knocked breathless.

The building loomed over me. The window I’d just come through gaped, jagged. Nothing moved in the dark behind it.

For a moment, I thought I’d made it.

Then something pale pressed against the inside of the opening.

A raw, lipless grin.

“New skin…” the Skinned Man crooned from inside the wall. “The hollow is still my den.”

I forced myself up. Blood soaked my hoodie around my left shoulder, hot and sticky. When I touched it, my fingers came away bright red, and pain screamed through the whole side of my body.

I ran.

Streets blurred. Storefronts, wrecked cars, dead signs. I caught flashes: graffiti reading WE TRIED THE DOOR / IT OPENED; a camera smashed on the sidewalk; a jacket caught on a fence, sleeve ripped off.

The dragging sound came again, somewhere behind me. Metal or bone on pavement. Slow. Patient.

I cut through another alley.

Trash cans on their sides, a reeking dumpster, walls closing in. At the end of the alley, half buried in weeds, sat an old blue sedan, windows grimy but intact, tires flat, driver’s door ajar.

I went for it.

I slipped inside, pulled the door shut as quietly as I could. The latch caught. The car smelled like dust and old fabric and something sweet and rotten.

I scrambled into the back and slid onto the floor behind the front seats, curling up as small as I could get. My shoulder throbbed. Blood soaked into the carpet.

Outside, the dragging sound passed the alley mouth. Pause. Move. Come back.

My heart pounded so hard the whole car felt like it was shaking.

I pulled out my phone.

No signal. Battery in the low twenties. Screen cracked.

I opened the notes app and started typing.

I wrote about Mason’s text. The coordinates. The thread. The noises in my house. Cinder Hollow. The church. The basement. The wall of meat. Mason’s face. The Skinned Man.

Every few lines, I stopped and listened.

Once, something bumped the rear of the car. The whole frame shuddered. Rust drifted down.

“New skin…” its voice floated through the metal. “Hiding in dead metal bones. Little mouse in a rusted shell…”

The driver’s handle rattled once, then stilled.

I held my breath until spots danced in my vision.

If anyone ever reads this—if my phone somehow sends this when I’m not looking, or someone finds this car and scrolls through the notes—please don’t treat it like a story.

Don’t tell the kid in your house that it’s “just pipes” or “just the wind” when he says something is walking over his bed at night. Don’t joke about too much internet when he tells you something he read won’t leave his head.

Listen.

Because if my dad had known what was pacing over my ceiling, what was whispering through the walls, what was waiting at the end of a road with no name, maybe I wouldn’t be curled up on the floor of a dead car in a dead town, bleeding through my clothes while something without skin sniffs at the doors.

The roof above me dents inward with a slow, deep groan.

Bone presses the metal down, leaving a small, round bulge inches from my face.

“Found you,” the Skinned Man whispers through the roof. Its voice vibrates in my teeth.

My phone shakes in my hand.

Battery at 18%.

No service.

I’m going to hit save now, even if it never sends. Maybe this will sit here forever. Maybe somebody will find it. Maybe it’ll just be one more ghost file on a dead device.

If you see anything online about Cinder Hollow, a thread asking where the skin went, or coordinates like the ones Mason sent me—if a kid named Luke ever shows up on a missing poster—

Please.

Daisy Shaw

Everyone in Chicago knew Ryland Pickwick, the notorious arms dealer, was a loose cannon.

He was bloodthirsty, cruel, and he loved to hold a blood-stained dagger to his opponent's throat whenever he played cards.

Lately, a rich man's illegitimate daughter caught his fancy, and their wedding was set for next week.

My fiancé, Harrison Pickwick, caught wind of it and disappeared for three days.

When I finally tracked him down, I overheard his conversation with his right-hand man.

""On the wedding day, deploy all our men to keep Anna safe and send Judy over in her place.

""I can't let Anna marry that psycho. Every woman he toyed with ended up broken.""

His right-hand man muttered, ""Rest assured, boss. It's all fixed.

""But... What about Ms. Hansen? If Ryland discovers that the bride has been switched, will he...""

Harrison snorted.

""What's there to be afraid of? He wouldn't dare to touch my girl.

""After the heat dies down, I'll divorce Anna and hold a fancier wedding for Judy.""

I stood outside, frozen to the core.

Turned out the love of my life had fallen for someone else.

I decided to go along with his plan. Yet once the swap was made, Harrison broke into tears.

***

After Harrison finished speaking, a woman's quiet sobs echoed through the private room.

Only then did I notice Anabella Ridgeway's presence. She sank into the leather sofa, her eyes rimmed with red, like a frightened kitty.

""Harry, it's not worth the risk! Ryland Pickwick is gonna kill you...""

Harrison brushed her tears away with his fingertip, his voice sweeter than honey. ""Rest assured. Fear is never in my dictionary.""

Then he chuckled, slipped his arm around her waist, and pulled her in. ""If you wanna thank me, just give me a bunch of kids.""

The people in the room instantly erupted in cheers and whistles.

Anabella's face flushed red as she buried her head into Harrison's arms.

""But, what about Ms. Hansen?""

""Judith?"" Harrison tittered. ""She's crazy about me. Even if she finds out, she'll forgive me after a few sweet nothings.""

His men chimed in, ""Mr. Pickwick is right! Ms. Hansen never says no to him!

""She wouldn't mind such a trifle.""

""Yeah. Everyone knows that she's hell-bent on marrying Mr. Pickwick.""

""Mr. Pickwick, you're so lucky. You get to marry the sweet Anabella, and the elegant Ms. Hansen is also waiting to be your bride.

""I wonder who you prefer, though.""

Harrison didn't respond. He pulled out a velvet box from his suit pocket, revealing a ruby ring.

It was the Pickwick family's heirloom, handed down to every bride through generations.

Under everyone's gaze, Harrison slid the ring onto Anabella's ring finger.

His action was enough to prove his determination to marry her.

Taken aback, Anabella tried to pull away, but he held her tightly.

""Since you will walk down the aisle with me, this ring belongs to you.""

Then he rubbed the ring and whispered, ""Don't let Judith see it. She may be compliant, but she's perceptive and paranoid.""

I stood outside the door, gazing at the ring, a bitter smile tugging at my lips.

Harrison's mother gave me that ring on her deathbed. It was a symbol of the Pickwick family's century-long heritage

Since we weren't officially married, I felt it was improper to wear it.

But three days ago, Harrison showed up at my apartment at midnight, saying he needed the ring for the ceremony.

So I opened the safe and gave him that ring.

I never once expected that the ceremony was meant for someone else.

I dashed out the door, straight into the pouring rain.

Bullets of rain pelted my body, wrenching my mind back to the night seven years ago.

My family and the Pickwicks had been close for generations.

Later, when they got into trouble, my father often secretly gave them financial help.

One day, the Pickwicks' sworn enemies found us. My mother hid me in the basement.

I could do nothing but watch as they brutally murdered my parents.

My father's blood squirted in my eyes, blurring my vision.

When reinforcements from the Pickwick family arrived, Harrison was the first to find me.

I bit him and kicked him like crazy, my nails raking his arm and leaving trails of blood. But he held me tightly until I blacked out, like he couldn't feel the pain.

In the wake of the upheaval, Hector Pickwick, Harrison's father, took me in and raised me out of gratitude.

Harrison brought me wherever he went. He saved me from the nightmares that haunted me and the vengeful rage that had once consumed me.

I grew deeply attached to him. I went to school and trained with him, stuck by him through thick and thin.

I thought we would stand by each other forever, never expecting that someone else would take my place.

If that was what he wanted, I would honor his choice.

When Harrison left the club, the rain was still falling. I had been sitting in the lobby the whole time.

The moment he caught sight of me, he let go of Anabella's hand, sprang behind me, and covered my eyes like he did when we were teens.

""Guess who I am.""

I yanked his hand away. ""It's not fun.""

With a chuckle, he casually draped his arm over my shoulder and caressed my cheek.

""Look at you, so ballsy! Aren't you afraid it'll be some perv?""

I said nothing, my gaze sweeping over Anabella and the troop of men behind him.

They didn't seem to worry that I had seen what just happened at all.

Because they knew I would always compromise with Harrison.

Harrison stepped between us, obscuring my sight. ""Did you come here looking for me?""

I nodded. ""The rain was heavy. I came here to take shelter.""

He took my hand like he'd done a million times, rubbing it in his palms to warm it up.

""You said you liked that exclusive Tiffany diamond bracelet, right? I forgot to tell you that I made a special trip to Los Angeles to get it for you.""

""Where's the bracelet then?"" I asked.

He cast Anabella a glance. ""It's a custom piece. I made a few tweaks to the design. So ... it won't be finished until the wedding's over.""

I forced a smile but said noth

While waiting for the car, Anabella suddenly let out a cry-her bracelet had hooked onto a nearby ornament.

With a forceful tug, the bracelet snapped and hit the marble ground, shining diamonds scattering in all directions.

It was the exact bracelet that I yearned for. There were only three in the world. I had mentioned it to Harrison several times.

He never bothered to buy it for me, and now, it was actually on someone else's wrist.

In a panic, Anabella crouched to pick them up, but a splinter of diamond cut her finger.

""Ouch!""

Blood oozed out. Harrison immediately released me and strode toward her.

""How can you be so careless?""

He swiftly removed his suit jacket and placed it over Anabella's shoulder. Then he used his tie to staunch the flow of blood.

I had given Harrison that tie as a birthday gift. He treasured it and treated it with meticulous care. Yet now, it was smeared with blood.

When he caught me staring, a shadow of guilt crossed his face.

""Judy, I'll take Anna to the clinic. You go in. I'll be back to get you.""

Before I could answer, he half-carried Anabella and climbed into the car.

To ease the tension, his men chimed in, ""Ms. Ridgeway helped Mr. Pickwick before. So he's returning the favor. Don't take it to heart. Do you want us to

give you a ride?""

I shook my head and told them to leave.

I just wanted to see if Harrison would keep his promise.

The night fell. Even when Hector called me and urged me to come home, Harrison was still nowhere in sight.

The next morning, he rushed into the villa. Seeing me sitting at the dining table set his mind at ease.

""Sorry, Judy. The car had a blowout. We were in the middle of nowhere with no phone signal. That's why I couldn't make it back for you."" 

I didn't listen to a single word he said.

My gaze was locked onto the hickey on his neck.

I reached for it, as though to expose his lies, but Harrison recoiled, adjusting the awkward scarf higher.

I looked down, digging my nails into my palm to fight back the tears.

""Your scarf looks out of place. I'll fix it for you.""

""No!"" He jumped at my words, then quickly changed the topic. ""Speaking of which, don't you need a diamond for the wedding veil? Let's go to the jewelry store and choose it now.""

As he spoke, he hurried to the car and waited for me.

I chuckled bitterly, tears rolling down my face.

By the time I changed clothes and stepped outside, the scarf was neatly fastened around his neck.

As the car pulled up to the jewelry store, a commotion reached us from inside.

I looked up at the VIP room on the second floor, and through the glass, I saw Anabella again.

Her face was streaked with tears, and a circle of rich women pushed and shoved her.

Harrison clenched his fists, his jaw tight, his gaze fixed on the second floor.

But he fought his urge to bolt upstairs and turned his gaze toward me.

I knew he wanted me to save Anabella's skin again.

This wasn't the first time.

Quite a few socialites didn't see eye to eye with Anabella.

Once, Anabella got pushed into the pool. Harrison jumped in and rescued her.

Afterwards, whenever she was in a jam, Harrison would always bail her out.

If he couldn't make an appearance, he let me handle it.

After the word got out that the casino tycoon, Ryland Pickwick, was going to marry Anabella, those ladies Fold Up green with envy. 

To catch Ryland's attention, they wouldn't hesitate to do plastic surgery and insert breast implants.

""Are you deaf? Take your clothes off! Let's see how big those titties are to enthrall the famous Ryland.""

""Please, don't do this. People are watching us.""

Anabella shook her head, tears gushing.

""Drop the innocent act! There's no way Ryland would know you got the goods if you hadn't flaunted them.

""If he can see them, why can't we?

""Will you take it off yourself, or should we help you?""

When Anabella was driven into a corner, Harrison nudged me.

""Judy, go!""

I staggered and almost fell.

But he was utterly fixated on Anabella and didn't notice that at all.

With a self-mocking curl of my lips, I headed to the second floor.

Seeing me, Anabella scuttled behind me and whispered shakily, ""Ms. Hansen, help...""

I glanced at the bullies and bellowed, ""How dare you make her strip in public? Aren't you afraid of being on tomorrow's front page?""

The leader, Elsie Thorp, smiled at me indifferently. ""Ms. Hansen, we're just curious. But take my advice, saint, either."" 

The leader, Elsie Thorp, smiled at me indifferently. ""Ms. Hansen, we're just curious. But take my advice, she's no saint, either.""

""Yeah, Ms. Hansen. I saw Mr. Pickwick take her to the hotel a few days ago. Isn't that suspicious?""

Anabella shook her head frantically.

""No! Ms. Hansen, don't listen to their nonsense!""

He clutched my arm and pulled me back. I couldn't break free even if I tried.

""Nonsense? You just don't have the guts to admit it!

""Yesterday, I even saw you two enter...""

Before she could finish, Anabella screamed and tumbled backward over the railing!

""Anna!""

Harrison lunged forward and caught her. They crashed to the ground together.

""Anna, are you all right? Did you get hurt?""

It took Anabella a moment to recover from the shock. She slowly looked up at me, tears pouring. ""Ms. Hansen, why did you push me? Did you really believe their lies?""

Harrison lifted his head, his gaze sharp and cold.

""Judith! I asked you to save her, not the other way around!""

Catching the flicker of satisfaction in Anabella's eyes, I suddenly understood why she had been pulling my arm.

""She jumped herself.""

She hung her head, her eyes rimmed with red, and she said timidly, ""It's my fault. I fell by accident...""

She trembled all over, looking pitiful and vulnerable.

Harrison cradled her, his heart full of sympathy.

""I saw everything clearly from below! You nudged her! And you still try to deny it?""

Meeting his scornful eyes, I realized that arguing was pointless.

Anabella staged the whole scene herself, and he wouldn't believe a word I said.

""If anything happens to her, I will never forgive you.""

With that, he ignored everyone, scooped Anabella up in his arms, and strode out of the jewelry store.

Before leaving, Anabella raised her brows at me and smiled triumphantly. I wasn't the only one who saw that smile. Elsie and her friends saw it, too.

Gnashing her teeth, Elsie thundered, ""That bitch! I knew she did it on purpose!

""Ms. Hansen, Mr. Pickwick is engaged to you. How dare she go after him? Don't you...""

She left the rest unsaid, probably convinced by those rumors that I was spineless.

Back at the villa, before I could even take a seat, Harrison stormed in.

He seized my wrist and dragged me toward the door. ""Anna is in the hospital because of you. Go apologize.""

I jerked my hand free and met his cold eyes.

""I said I didn't push her. Why should I apologize?""

""I believe what I saw. Judy, don't test my patience.""

With that, he produced my father's ring, the only keepsake I had of him.

When we got engaged, I gave it to him as a token of our love. It was the thing that I cherished most.

My heart sank as a chill ran through me.

""You're gonna threaten me 

""Not threaten. As long as you apologize, everything will go back to the way it was.""

I laughed, tears rolling down my cheeks.

I looked away, quickly wiped my tears, and swallowed hard. ""Fine. I'll go. But once I apologize, give me back my ring.""

Harrison paused. He opened his mouth, but the words died in his throat. In the end, he gave a reluctant nod.

Anabella was placed in the Pickwick family's private hospital. She was now curling up in the bed and weeping quietly.

The sight of me gave her quite a start.

""I'm sorry.""

After saying that, I stared at Harrison.

He held Anabella by the shoulders and said coldly, ""Apologize on your knees.""

I gawked at him in disbelief, my heart desolate.

I sank to my knees and repeated the words. ""I'm sorry.""

Anabella tried to rise from the bed as if to help me up, but Harrison stopped her.

""She owes you an apology. Rest up. Nothing can go wrong at the wedding.""

He didn't even bother to lie.

I stood up, snatched the ring from his hand, and turned to leave.

No matter how he shouted my name, I marched ahead, steadfast.

We hadn't come across each other again until the wedding day.

After all the formalities, he sent me into the wedding car and whispered, ""No matter what happens, don't freak out. I'll come to get you later.""

I stayed quiet.

After circling the city, the car suddenly stopped on the bridge.

About ten minutes later, it started moving again.

But I sensed the route had changed. It didn't head to the Pickwick's villa, but to Ryland's manor in the south.

When the car halted, my heart clenched.

As Hector's illegitimate son, Ryland was never acknowledged by the family and grew up in the slums.

He was ruthless. He clawed his way up from the bottom, conquered, and took over several rival gangs.

Feared by every gangster, he became known as the ""King of Gambling.""

I had met him a few times. He always struck me as cold and unapproachable.

As the car door opened, he looked at me without a trace of surprise. Instead, he flashed a grin and asked, ""You're here? Are you hungry?""

""Why weren't you surprised to see me?""

""Were you not the same?""

I was so nervous that I forgot to pretend.

Ryland chuckled. ""Do you want to go back to Harrison?""

I shook my head.

""From now on, you're my wife.""

Hand in hand, we walked up the red carpet. The wedding eclipsed the one the Pickwick family held, but the guests were surprisingly sparse.

Most were his brothers from the gang.

During the ceremony, Ryland kissed me. I didn't resist and let him deepen the kiss.

That night, he claimed me like a ravenous beast. His thirst was almost unquenched.

His hot breath grazed my ear as I whimpered and attempted to run, but he gripped my ankle and hauled me back.

All night, no matter how I begged, he refused to stop.

Not until the sun rose did he pat my back and coax me to sleep.

Yet I had barely closed my eyes when I heard Harrison's furious roar. ""Already married? That's a load of bull!""

He kicked the door open and stormed in.

Harrison charged into the bedroom, his eyes blazing red. ""Ryland! Where's my wife? I'm taking her home!""

Ryland swiftly wrapped me in the blanket and stood before the bed.

""What's your problem? Shouldn't your wife be at home? Stop making a scene here!""

""There was a mix-up yesterday! Judith was sent to you! Where is she? Which room?""

Seeing Harrison so anxious, Ryland smirked and deliberately revealed the scratch marks on his back.

Harrison's eyes widened in shock as he fixated on the scratch marks. ""You...""

His words were caught in his throat, his heart raced, and his gaze wandered to the giant bed draped in dark curtains.

""My wife sleeps in my bed. Duh! Who would put their wife in the guest room?""

Harrison's lips quivered. He couldn't force a single word out.

I chimed in at the right moment, my voice raspy from sleep. ""Sweetheart, who's there?""

That came like a bolt from the blue, and Harrison staggered, almost losing his balance.

The butler rushed to steady Harrison, but Harrison shoved him aside. He hissed, ""Piss off! Don't touch me!""

Harrison snapped his head toward Ryland and glared at him. ""Ryland! You know what she means to me! How dare you defile her?

""Judy, it's me! Talk to me, Judy! Did he force you?""

He lunged forward, but Ryland kicked him in the stomach. He grunted and stumbled backward.

""Harrison, don't flip out on me!""

Ryland's words dripped with disdain.

""Besides, you know who's behind this, don't you?""

Harrison gritted his teeth, his eyes burning with fury. ""You've known it all along?""

Ryland offered no reply, only a cold smirk playing on his lips.

""Get out!""

""I won't leave without her!""

Harrison lunged forward again, grappling with Ryland. Both went for the kill. Within moments, Harrison's face was marked with bruises and blood.

By the time I threw on my robe and rushed out, Ryland had already pinned Harrison against the wall, twisting his arm behind his back.

But the moment Harrison saw me, he thrashed violently. ""Judy! Judy, come here! I'll take you home!""

His eyes sparkled with a feverish mix of hope and desperation, as if he truly cared about me.

I watched him serenely. ""What about Anabella? What do you plan to do with her?""

Harrison's smile vanished.

""Last time, I was drunk. I mistook her for you. It was too late.

""But I'll take care of it! You're the only woman I'll ever call wife! I'll make her move out. She won't come between us again!""

I cut him short. ""That won't be necessary. I won't go back.""

""Nonsense!""

He snapped, ""How am I going to tell my father? And my mother? Before she passed, she entrusted that family heirloom to...""

I laughed bitterly. ""What's the point of telling me this now? Didn't you put that ruby ring on Anabella's finger yourself?""

Harrison blanched. He didn't expect me to know this.

""The night at the casino, I heard everything, yet I still played along with you. Call it even now.

""You should leave.""

Words failed him. He finally realized why I had been acting strangely over the past few days.

I walked up to Ryland, touched the split corner of his lips, and asked softly, ""Does it hurt? I'll fetch the first-aid kit.""

He grabbed my wrist. When he was about to lead me back to the room, Hector and his men arrived. 

Seeing me with Ryland, Hector turned livid. His finger trembled as he pointed at Ryland. ""Brat! That's your sister-in-law! How could you? Alas!""

Hector's presence gave Harrison some hope. He shouted, ""Dad, dad! Judy is my wife! She should be mine!""

""Don't worry. I'll set this right for you!""

I looked at Ryland. Though his face registered composure, his hands behind him were clenched.

I gently took his hand and met Hector's gaze. ""Sir, Harrison orchestrated this to marry Anabella. It has nothing to do with Ryland.""

""What? What are you talking about?"" Hector was clearly in the dark, convinced it was all by Ryland's design.

I added, ""If you don't believe me, you can check with Anabella and see if she's wearing the Pickwick family's ruby ring.""

Hector shot Harrison a glare. ""Is that true? Did you do it?""

Harrison closed his eyes and sank to his knees.

""Yes, it was all my doing. I can't bear to watch Anna marry a degenerate like Ryland! That's why I went to such lengths!

""But Judy, I have never given up on you! Come back with me now, and we can sweep this under the rug!""

As soon as he finished talking, Hector kicked him hard.

""Bastard! That marriage was arranged long ago! How dare you mess it up!""

Hector turned to me and said, ""But good thing that no one knows it yet. Judy, come home with us. I'll make it up to you!

""I'll send that Anabella away immediately and right all the wrongs done to you!""

Hector's plea felt genuine. He truly wanted me back. For all these years, he had been treating me like his future daughter-in-law.

Noticing my silence, Ryland tightened his grip, as if afraid I might say yes.

No way I would do that.

""Sir, forgive me, but Ryland is also your son. I'm willing to marry him.""

""My dear, don't talk nonsense! He's nothing but an illegitimate son. How could he ever be good enough for you?""

""But I'm just an orphan. You took me in out of your kindness. Since Harrison carries a torch for Anabella, I'll let them be together. It's for the best.""

Hector sighed, staring daggers at Harrison, then kicked him again. ""Brat! Look what you have done!

""Before this blows out of proportion, get rid of that girl right now!""

The butler chimed in, ""I'm afraid it's too late. The news has traveled far and wide.""


""What?"" Harrison jerked his head up, bewildered.

He had originally planned to bring me back and leak the news to humiliate Ryland.

But now, things had gotten out of hand. He might never get the chance to bring me back.

It wasn't until this moment that he completely lost his bearings.

Watching me holding hands with Ryland, he kept shaking his head, tears streaming down his face. ""No, Judy! You can't stay here! You can't!

""If you don't leave now, there will be no turning back!""

I stayed quiet, rubbing my temples and whispering to Ryland, ""Sweetheart, my head hurts. I'd like to return to our room and lie down.""

Ryland gestured for the maid to escort me out.

""Judy! Judy!"" Harrison wanted to follow, but the bodyguard stopped him cold.

Frustrated, Hector shot Ryland a stare and said austerely, ""Get your brother back now!""

No matter how fiercely Harrison fought, it was all in vain.

That evening, while I tended to Ryland's wounds, he furrowed his brows and seemed to have a lot on his mind.

I turned to fetch the first-aid kit, but he pulled me back and had me sit on his lap.

His spontaneous action caught me off guard, leaving me unsure what to do.

Just as I was about to rise, he murmured, ""Seven years ago, I was the one who found you first, not Harrison.""

I was utterly dumbfounded. ""What did you just say?""

He rolled up his sleeve, revealing a tooth-bite-shaped old scar on his forearm.

I touched the scar with shaky fingers, my heart hammering in my chest. ""How could it be you?""

""Back then, I had just made a name for myself in underground boxing, but Hector summoned me back to work for him. I was the first to break into your house that night.

""I carried you out of the basement.

When you asked my name, I didn't tell you.

""I didn't think that you would mistake me for Harrison.""

I frowned slightly and examined Ryland's face, my finger gently tracing the scar beneath his brow.

I had long noticed that Harrison had no scar on his face, and I figured that I remembered it wrong.

""That'll explain it. Whenever I ask Harrison about that night, he always gives me the runaround. I thought he was trying to spare my feelings. It turned out he didn't know.

""Why didn't you tell me the truth later?""

He replied, ""You were certain it was him, and you liked him so much. I didn't see the point of bringing it up. Besides, it was just a brief encounter in the chaos.""

I slowly shook my head, cupped his face, and met his gaze. ""No, it's not. If you hadn't found me that night, I would have died in that basement.""

He held the back of my head, pulled me close, and kissed me affectionately.

But then, I gently pushed him back, my voice tinged with a hint of curiosity and jealousy. ""But, why did you marry Anabella?""

Seeing my stern face, Ryland chuckled.

""That was just an excuse to brush off those people trying to set me up with a date.

""As for Anabella, she shares a past with Harrison. Now, with your wedding coming up, I can't just sit back and do nothing.

""So, I thought I would test Harrison. See how he will respond if I ask to marry Anabella.

""To my surprise, he pulled a switcheroo, so I played his game and let you unwittingly deliver you to me.""

I froze, struggling to wrap my head around it.

""No wonder you weren't surprised to see me.""

""You were no different,"" he said with a smirk. ""I know who I will be marrying. So do you. It lines up perfectly, doesn't it?""

We changed a smile, sharing a tacit acknowledgment of everything.

When Harrison reached the Pickwick's villa, the front gate was teeming with people, including the Ridgeways.

The Ridgeways didn't object to the marriage swap.

Although Ryland was currently more popular, Harrison and he were still brothers. 

For them, their goal was to forge an alliance with the Pickwicks, so it didn't matter which son their daughter was betrothed to.

Caleb Pickwick couldn't stop praising, ""Anna is truly fortunate to be marrying you!

""You're so young and successful. Anna could not have hoped for a better match! We fully support this marriage!""

Harrison forced a smile. He had no desire to indulge them.

Seeing Harrison distracted, Anabella wanted to speak, but Hector cut her off. ""Our first choice for marriage had been Judy. But since the deed is done, we won't fuss over it. Let it be a lesson for Harrison's waywardness and keep your daughter away from us for now.""

Anabella sprang to her feet. ""What?""

Before she could defend herself, Caleb thundered, ""The adults are speaking! Don't interrupt!""

He turned to Hector with an obsequious smile. ""Sir Pickwick, forgive my daughter! We have no objections. The Pickwick family is distinguished, and a wife like Ms. Hansen befits Harrison perfectly.""

But Anabella didn't agree to it. She elbowed Harrison, hoping he could stick up for her.

As she moved, the ruby ring on her wrist slipped into view, and Hector happened to see it.

His face instantly darkened. He smacked the coffee table and fumed, ""Some, take that ring off Ms. Ridgeway's finger.""

Biting her lips, Anabella nudged Harrison again. ""Harry, you promised that this ring...""

""Take it off, Anna."" Harrison shut his eyes wearily. ""I'll buy you a better one.""

Before Anabella could react, the bodyguards stepped up, deftly removed the ring, polished it, and placed it in Hector's hand.

After the Ridgeways left, the scandal became the talk of the town.

At the charity dinner, we naturally became the center of attention.

Harrison looked at me openly, and I averted my gaze.

By accident, a waiter spilled wine on my dress. As I went to the lounge to tidy up, Harrison trailed after me.

He blocked my path and presented a diamond bracelet.

""Judy...""

I cut him short. ""Do you think I need this now?""

His face turned pale as he stubbornly held his hand out.

""Judy, I'm sorry for what I did to you, but you can't be with Ryland! He's unworthy of you!

""Come with me. Give me a chance to make it up to you. Please?""

With that, he leaned in to put the bracelet around my wrist.

But I thrust my hand away. The bracelet fell onto the marble floor, shattering into pieces as it had at the club that day.

He froze to the spot, tears welling up in his eyes.

I smiled faintly.

""This bracelet looks better on Anabella.""

Harrison knew exactly what I meant. His face went even paler, etched with pure shame.

He was about to speak when a shrill argument broke out nearby.

Martha Vyner, the Vyner Group heiress who'd always been hung up on Ryland, had cornered Anabella on the patio with Elsie and a couple of her lackeys.

""If you hadn't butted in, I'd at least have had a chance! Now that Ms. Hansen is married to Ryland, what am I supposed to do?""

Martha tried to shove Anabella, but Anabella smacked her hand away.

""I'm Mrs. Pickwick now! Go ahead and lay a finger on me! I dare you!""

""Bitch! Aren't you scared I'll spill all your dirty secrets to Mr. Pickwick?""

""Ryland and I are rock solid. Nothing you say could come between us!"" Anabella shot back.

As soon as Anabella finished speaking, Elsie lunged forward and slapped her hard across the face!

Harrison instinctively moved to intervene, but Elsie's roar stopped him cold. ""We all saw you fake that fall at the jewelry store to frame Ms. Hansen that day!

""Lately, Mr. Pickwick's been sending lavish gifts to Ryland's villa just to win Ms. Hansen's forgiveness. Even when she throws it out, he keeps coming back! You think he'll still want you once he finds out the truth?"" 

That sent Anabella over the edge. ""So what?"" she shrieked. ""I got him to stay once. I can do it again!""

""You have no shame! First, you stole my fiancé because you thought his family connections were better than yours! The second his family got investigated, you cut ties with him right away. You almost drove him to kill himself over you!

""A while back, you didn't think the professor's son your family picked for you had a promising future, so you faked drowning to latch onto Mr. Pickwick. You ruined his relationship with Ms. Hansen for good! This is all on you! I'm gonna make sure Mr. Pickwick finds out today!""

Elsie turned to leave after that, but Anabella pounced and grabbed her by the hair!

""Bitch! I fought for what's mine. Who do you think you are to ruin me?""

She went crazy, hitting and scratching Elsie like a maniac. Martha and the others tried to pull her off, only to get scratched and bloodied themselves.

At that moment, Anabella didn't look even a little bit as delicate as she usually did.

""Anabella, are you out of your mind? You dared to hit me?""

""So what? Harry's got my back!""

With that, she kicked Elsie, who was now on the ground, and then threw herself into the nearby ornamental pond, screaming for help.

Harrison and I watched every single second of this.

I let out a scoff and turned to leave, but a heavy thud came from behind me.

Harrison had dropped to his knees right in front of me.

""Judy..."" His voice trembled. ""So, that's the truth... I've been blind this whole time.""

I turned and looked down at him, a sneer tugging at my lips. ""It's too late for apologies, Mr. Pickwick. Take care.""

Back in the hall, I ran into Ryland, who'd been looking for me.

I filled him in on what just happened, and as I spoke, security brought up Martha, Elsie, and Anabella.

Some had scratched-up faces, and others had messy hair.

Anabella got the worst of it. She was carried up on a stretcher, soaking wet and unconscious from swallowing so much water.

That night, the Pickwick family was thrown into utter chaos.

After they got back, Anabella was put under house arrest.

When she woke up, she had no clue what was going on and threw a fit demanding to see Harrison, only to be hit with proof that she was the one who started the rumors about the wedding swap. 

Harrison slammed the divorce papers in front of her right then and there, and Anabella passed out from anger.

She was sent back to the Ridgeway family before long and ended up in Elsie's hands.

Word got around that her dad married her off to an old, rich guy with weird kinks.

Ryland had just finished telling me all this when the butler came to announce, ""Mr. Pickwick is here. He's heading to the Middle East to handle the family business and wanted to say goodbye.""

""No need for that,"" I smiled faintly. ""Tell him he can come to the party after September.""

The butler froze for a second, then laughed and left.

Ryland was confused. ""After September? Is that your birthday?""

I just smiled without answering and got up to leave.

Suddenly, it clicked. His eyes lit up instantly! Ryland laughed heartily, caught up to me in a few strides, and scooped me up into his arms, his entire being radiating unrestrained joy.

We had an amazing experience with all our vendors and wanted to leave a quick review about all of them! We also got so many great ideas and advice from this subreddit, so we hope our post helps other couples out. Background: Our wedding was a Vietnamese/Chinese wedding, on a Friday, with about 125 guests.

**Purslane Catering**

Elena was our event producer and she was communicative and organized throughout the process. Purslane is pretty strict with what you can or cannot do, but they do make some exceptions so it’s worth asking. The food was delicious—both of us are picky foodies and our families have high standards, and everyone was well-fed with super generous portions. We did 1 signature cocktail, 4 hors d’oeuvres, a plated starter, and family-style entrées and sides, with wedding cake as the dessert (they also provide a coffee and tea service). Service was great, and the bartenders were fast and poured strong. 



**Petite Planning Company (Wedding Planner)** 

We hired The Petite Planning Company for month-of coordination, and Amanda’s calm yet confident personality immediately made us feel like we were on track and that she could handle everything. She’s incredibly organized with great systems in place, and handled all timeline planning, logistics, parking permits, and vendor coordination seamlessly. We really appreciated that we only needed one longer planning meeting with her, with everything else done over email/text. She gets everything immediately and doesn’t need any follow-up or reminders. She’s also clearly very experienced with weddings and gave us great advice throughout. On the wedding day, she and her colleague (Maria) set up our décor beautifully and made the entire wedding day run perfectly without us having to worry about a thing. 

 

**Kinda Formal (Florals and Decor)**

We found Jasmine from another Boathouse wedding and instantly loved her fun, creative, and modern style. She understood our vision right away and incorporated cultural elements like Asian fruits into the décor. The florals turned out absolutely stunning and fit the Boathouse and the season so well. The Boathouse has a short set-up window of 2 hours, which Jasmine and her team were highly experienced with. Our wedding day turned out to be very windy and we saw Jasmine improvising with the outdoor décor. Jasmine is super fun, cool, and easy to work with. The floral design was probably one of the most fun parts of the wedding planning process and we genuinely loved hanging out with her during the whole process! 

 

**Ochirova Photography**

Aisa photos were vibrant, moody, beautifully composed, and better than we could have expected. My husband and I are not great at posing, so we really appreciated that Aisa was very communicative and good at instructing us to capture the perfect photos that looked good but still felt like us. Prior to the wedding, Aisa put together her own Pinterest board and shared her vision with us. Leading up to the wedding, we also exchanged messages about ideas for photos and Aisa's genuine excitement for our wedding got us even more excited. On the wedding day she worked incredibly hard, literally running around and crawling into bushes to get the perfect shot. She’s also so efficient with edits and delivered previews within 48 hours (our engagement photos were delivered within 24 hours). We truly feel like she's so talented, passionate, and dedicated to her craft and are so grateful that she was our photographer!

 

**Tori Photography** 

Aisa brought Tori as a second shooter and she was fantastic. Similar to Aisa, she was very friendly, professional, and dedicated to getting the shot! We saw her running around from the upstairs balcony (to get overhead shots) to the bridge across the venue. The photos she took were beautiful and complemented the main gallery perfectly. 

 

**The Vows Vault (Content Creation)**

We found Gaby on TikTok and loved her bubbly, positive energy. As neither of us post much on social media, we did not have specific content in mind for Gaby to develop. Our main purpose was to have someone capture the important moments for our own memories. Prior to the wedding, Gaby sent us links to sample wedding content as inspiration for the reels she would create. On the wedding day, Gaby came early and fully prepared with her phone, a microphone, a gimbal, and her own lighting. She also worked really well with our photographer. She delivered an Instagram reel the next day along with organized folders of all raw clips. She is communicative, organized, and a true professional. She also has such a fun and vibrant personality, and I genuinely loved hanging out with her on our wedding day. She was a last-minute addition but we are so glad we hired her! 

 

**DJ Marcus Ho**

Marcus was an incredible DJ and totally nailed the music, timeline, and energy. Leading up to the wedding, we completed his worksheet and had a planning meeting where we went over the timeline and logistics. Marcus is extremely detailed-oriented, professional, and experienced with weddings and it really came through in the planning meetings. He asked us important questions that we hadn’t thought of and made sure that every base was covered. We had an emcee, a pianist, and 2 singers, and Marcus coordinated all the transitions seamlessly. He showed up early for set-up and did a mic check during cocktail hour. Once the dance floor opened, it stayed PACKED and everyone commented on how great the music was. 

 

**MCBOM (Celebrant/Emcee/Singer)**

MCBOM was our bilingual (English/Vietnamese) celebrant, emcee, and one of our singers. With the information we provided in a ceremony template, he created a personalized, heartfelt speech that had guests thinking he was a close friend. As an emcee, he kept everything on schedule while keeping both older and younger guests engaged and laughing. One of our favorite moments was when he started rapping Bruno Mars on the dance floor – it was totally unexpected and got the crowd so hyped up! He brought so much warmth and fun to our wedding.

 

**Magical Matt (Bonkerz Entertainment)**

Magical Matt was absolutely fantastic and was one of the most talked-about parts of our wedding! We hired him for cocktail hour. Our cocktail hour was planned for outside but guests ended up moving indoors as it was a little chilly - it actually worked out perfectly because Matt went from table to table entertaining guests. All our guests raved about how mind-blowing his tricks were and how great he was at working the crowd and making people laugh. We had guests of all ages (including children) and he had tricks for everyone. He even stayed on a little longer hoping to see us, but unfortunately, my husband and I were too busy during cocktail hour. A true professional! 

 

**Sachiko Yanase (Hair & Makeup)**

Sachiko did hair and makeup for me, our moms, and my sister. Everyone wanted natural and elegant looks, and she totally nailed it. She took detailed notes during my HMU trial and we made a couple of small adjustments on the day. My makeup looked natural yet photographed beautifully, and I truly felt like the most beautiful version of myself. Sachiko was punctual, prepared for every situation (she brings along everything that you could possibly need, lashes, eyelid tape, etc), and so friendly and fun to spend the morning with. 

 

**Win Son Bakery (Wedding)**

We ordered an 8-inch cutting cake plus sheet cakes. We chose the almond cake and asked them to do a guava jam. The cake was so flavorful and moist, and many of our guests said that they had multiple slices. The 8-inch cake was surprisingly massive and felt like great value. For the cutting cake design, we sent them some inspiration pictures and they did a wonderful job! We also highly recommend the black sesame cake flavor. 

  
Happy to answer any questions about the venue or our vendors! :)

Someone who shows up on time, keeps their word, and notices the small details is incredibly attractive. It doesn’t take grand gestures or expensive gifts. It takes quiet, thoughtful actions that make you feel seen and valued.A person who is calm, kind, and gentle (not weak, but soft in the best way) can be profoundly sexy. It’s in how they make you feel safe, understood, and cared for. Often the most attractive people are the ones who don’t try to impress at all. They simply show up, they listen, and they care.It’s never about money or perfection. It’s about intention, time, and love. The sexiest people are the ones who make you feel chosen, deeply understood, and quietly, undeniably wanted.",2,1764520603.0,NepalWrites,1,1.0,False

I’m in Manila for a bit and would love to meet some new people for coffee and conversation.

A few things up front so it is clear:
I’m in a happy relationship and not looking to date. I’ll likely move here long term with my partner in the next few years, so I am hoping to start building some friendships now and stay in touch over time.

About me:
	•	36/M, from the US, have spent a lot of time living in Europe
	•	Music nerd, bass player, into live gigs and talking about anything creative
	•	Also enjoy talking about travel, food, work, and the strange way life never goes as planned

What I am looking for:
	•	People who enjoy good coffee and relaxed conversation
	•	Anyone who is up for exploring cafes, recommending spots in the city, or just hanging out and chatting for an hour or two

If you know nice coffee places in Makati/BGC or nearby, or you just want to grab a cup and talk about life, music, or whatever comes up, feel free to message me.",0,1764520575.0,makati,0,0.5,False

I had coffee grinds down to 3 - I had water down to 30ml for an espresso shot (I am not given a 20ml option) - is there a way to do this?

I am literally placing 4 shots to try to get the strength up - but too much water still for the intensity of coffee - on the most intense and highest heat btw.

The beans are from DeLonghi and fresh

The pucks are firm when cleaning them out - as in they are well formed.

How can I get richer creamy coffee density ratio to the milk with less water? I am struggling to achieve this.

I thought hitting the espresso once, the single espresso once and one latte which adds another espresso shot - all 30m extra song mind you - the double espresso is 60ml

I have had moments of 4 shots being strong - but again - the ratio between coffee with too much water and the milk content is not working - I want more coffee and milk.

What else can I do - is it in your advice - maybe re reads I can find what else I can do. But if you can point out what I am doing wrong or what else I can do, it would be muchly appreciated",1,1764520564.0,coldbrew,1,1.0,False

Rent: $3800
Move in: early December
Lease ends: March 31, 2026, option to renew, rent stabilized. 

This is a huge studio in the heart of park slope. While it’s technically a studio, it has a half wall separating the bedroom from the living room. This is a lease takeover, so you get my lease term with the option to renew. To give you a sense of size, I have a queen bed in the bedroom. In the living room, I have a full size couch, a dining table and a desk. You’re essentially getting a one bedroom at the price of a studio. Also the building is rent stabilized, so they’re limited in how much they can raise rent. 

The apartment is an 8 min walk to Barclays, which means you’re close to every train line. This area of park slope is great. Tons of bars and restaurants on 5th Ave. Walking distance to 4 grocery stores and prospect park. 

Other perks:
- Elevator / Doorman building
- Fitness center
- In unit washer and dryer
- Rooftop with grills
- Pet friendly 

Really great apartment in a great neighborhood. I'm moving to a bigger apartment to accommodate a baby on the way. Otherwise, I would have stayed in this apartment for a long time.",4,1764520394.0,LeaseTakeoverNYC,0,1.0,False

1pamfx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kind-Claim-2577/comments/1pamfx6/how_vintage_cups_became_instagrams_favorite/,How Vintage Cups Became Instagram’s Favorite Aesthetic Prop,"In a world overflowing with filters, presets, and carefully curated feeds, the simplest objects are often the ones that create the biggest visual impact. And over the last few years, nothing has captured the imagination of aesthetic lovers quite like vintage cups. These delicate teacups, retro mugs, and ornate porcelain pieces have quietly become Instagram’s most-loved prop—appearing in flat-lays, cozy corner shots, desk aesthetics, bookish posts, cottagecore reels, and even minimalist morning routines.

But how did something as humble as an old teacup suddenly become a cultural phenomenon?

Let’s explore the journey—from forgotten cupboards to global aesthetic obsession—and uncover the stories behind the rise of vintage cups on social media.

# Why Vintage Cups Suddenly Feel So… Aesthetic

There’s something timeless about a vintage cup. Whether it’s a dainty floral teacup with gold trim or a chunky 70s-style ceramic mug, each piece carries visual charm and emotional nostalgia. Instagram’s aesthetic culture thrives on objects that feel warm, personal, and story-rich—and vintage cups are exactly that.

But the rise of vintage cups isn’t random. It ties into several cultural shifts:

# 1. The Rise of “Slow Living” and Nostalgic Aesthetics

Over the past few years, social media trends have shifted from fast-paced luxury to slow-living simplicity. Keywords like *cozy*, *cottagecore*, *soft life*, *vintage vibes*, *hygge*, and *old money aesthetic* have exploded in popularity.

A vintage cup fits perfectly into this movement because:

* It symbolizes intentional living
* It adds a soft, nostalgic charm to a photo
* It feels handcrafted, not mass-produced
* It captures a warm, homey atmosphere

According to platform trend analysis, posts featuring vintage or antique props have grown steadily and now appear in millions of photo tags. Vintage cups, especially floral porcelain, are among the top shared items in cozy-themed posts.

# 2. The “Tiny Object, Big Impact” Visual Rule

Photographers and content creators often rely on props that are small, portable, and easy to style. Vintage cups check all the boxes:

* They anchor a composition without overwhelming it
* They add texture, color, and depth
* They make a scene look intentional
* They create a sense of warmth and personality

A simple cup of tea becomes more than just a drink—it becomes a mood.

 

# 3. Retro Design Is Back in Style

Design cycles typically repeat every 20–30 years, and today we’re seeing a major return to retro aesthetics:

* 1980s pastel designs
* 1970s earthy ceramics
* 1950s floral porcelain
* Art Deco geometric teacups

Each design era has its own visual language, which is why creators love vintage cups—they instantly bring historical flavor to modern content.

 

# From Grandma’s Shelf to Instagram Fame

So how did these forgotten pieces make their comeback?

1. The Thrifting Boom

Globally, the secondhand market is growing fast, with millions of shoppers turning to thrift stores, vintage markets, and resale platforms. Vintage cups became easy to discover and even easier to purchase.

Collectors love:

* Fine bone china from the 1800s
* 1940s and 50s teacups
* Mid-century modern mugs
* Handmade ceramic cups from the 70s

Aesthetic creators particularly love anything floral, pastel, or ornate—and Instagram stories often showcase “thrift hauls” featuring beautiful teacups for a few dollars.

 

2. The Pinterest and Instagram “Kitchen Shelfie” Trend

The “shelfie” trend—stylish photos of organized shelves—pushed [vintage cups](https://www.truegether.com/category/antiques) further into the spotlight. A neatly arranged display of mismatched cups instantly gives a homey, cottagecore feel.

Creators realized that adding just one vintage cup instantly elevated their shelf aesthetic.

 

3. Tea Culture and Coffee Culture Rebirth

With tea rituals, matcha whisking, latte art, and morning routine reels going viral, cups naturally gained attention. But vintage cups carry emotional weight—people associate them with:

* childhood memories
* grandma’s kitchen
* handwritten recipes
* special occasions
* old traditions

The moment a vintage cup appears in a reel, the entire mood becomes softer and more sentimental.

# The Psychology Behind the Trend: Why We Love Vintage Cups

Believe it or not, there’s real psychology behind this trend.

1. They Signal Comfort and Safety

The soft curves, floral patterns, and delicate details evoke familiarity and warmth. In a chaotic digital world, people crave cozy visuals.

2. They Represent Care and Intentionality

Pouring tea into a vintage cup takes more effort than using a modern mug. It shows small acts of self-care.

3. They Spark Curiosity

Every cup looks unique, which leads viewers to wonder:

* Where is it from?
* How old is it?
* Who used it before?

This makes the visuals more engaging—which is why vintage cup posts often get higher interaction rates.

# How Vintage Cups Turned Into a Social Media Status Symbol

Vintage cups are not just aesthetic—they’ve become a subtle symbol of taste and personality.

1. Owning one implies good artistic taste

People use vintage cups as props to show they know art, history, or design trends.

2. They fit into multiple aesthetic niches

* Dark academia
* Cottagecore
* Minimalist cozy
* Hygge
* Retro vintage
* Bookstagram
* Clean girl morning routine
* Study-with-me setups

The versatility makes them perfect for influencers who need multipurpose props.

3. They add a “personal brand” touch

Creators often reuse the same cup across multiple posts, making it recognizable to followers.

# How Instagram Creators Use Vintage Cups in Their Content

Let’s break down the most popular ways influencers are using these cups today.

✔ 1. Cozy Reading Corners

A steaming cup next to a book instantly boosts the “warm reading night” aesthetic.

✔ 2. Flat-lays

Paired with dried flowers, handwritten notes, or lace fabric, vintage cups create a romantic vibe.

✔ 3. Morning Routine Reels

Whether it's matcha or turmeric latte, it looks better in a vintage cup.

✔ 4. Desk Setups

Writers, students, and work-from-home creators use them to add personality to their workspace.

✔ 5. Home Decor Displays

Curated shelves, tiered trays, and kitchen corners often feature a line of mismatched vintage cups.

✔ 6. Product Photography

Small businesses selling candles, bracelets, stationery, or soaps use vintage cups to soften their product shots.

# Interesting Figures That Show Their Popularity

* Posts tagged with vintage or retro aesthetic props have increased by more than 70% in the last few years.
* Photos featuring ornate teacups or vintage mugs receive noticeably higher engagement in cozy-themed niches.
* Searches for “vintage teacup,” “retro mug,” and “antique china” continue to grow on resale marketplaces.
* More than half of décor lovers now say they prefer buying secondhand or vintage household items.
* Cups from certain eras—especially pre-1950 bone china—have seen a significant rise in resale interest.

Vintage cups aren't just a trend; they are part of a much bigger cultural shift toward mindful living, sustainable shopping, and aesthetic-driven content.

 

# Where Creator Communities Are Finding Their Vintage Cups

One of the biggest reasons this trend exploded is accessibility. Today, anyone can find beautiful vintage cups without hunting through antique shops for hours.

Here are the most popular places creators search:

1. Thrift Stores and Flea Markets

Local gems often have unique pieces for extremely low prices.

2. Estate Sales

Older homes sometimes have entire china sets in pristine condition.

3. Online Marketplaces

This is where the real boom happened.

People now source vintage cups from [sites like eBay](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html), Etsy, and similar resale marketplaces where sellers list rare finds. Smaller platforms also make it easier to get budget-friendly pieces without huge fees—some creators prefer places like TrueGether because they can negotiate more openly with sellers.

# Tips for Choosing the Perfect Vintage Cup for Your Aesthetic

If you're thinking of joining the trend (or enhancing your photography game), here’s how to pick the right cup:

1. Match the Era to Your Aesthetic

* Cottagecore: Floral bone china
* Minimalist retro: Simple 1970s glazed ceramics
* Dark academia: Deep-toned, ornate teacups
* Coastal or light academia: Pastel porcelain

2. Pay Attention to Details

Look for:

* Gold trim
* Hand-painted flowers
* Maker’s marks at the bottom
* Unique handles
* Glaze patterns

3. Consider How It Will Photograph

Darker cups work better in moody shots. Pastel or floral cups shine in bright, soft lighting.

4. Mix and Match

A mismatched set is actually more aesthetic than a perfect one. It looks authentic, lived-in, and whimsical.

# Why This Trend Isn’t Going Away Anytime Soon

Vintage cups tap into deeper cultural values:

* Sustainability – Buying old instead of new
* Nostalgia – A longing for gentler times
* Self-expression – Your cup, your story
* Visual charm – They simply look beautiful

As long as Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest celebrate cozy living and storytelling visuals, vintage cups will remain beloved props.

In fact, the trend is only expanding. Creators now use them as candle holders, tiny planters, jewelry trays, and even gift packaging. Their versatility keeps them relevant.

# Final Thoughts: A Tiny Object That Changed Aesthetic Culture

Who would have imagined that a delicate cup — perhaps once part of someone’s wedding gift set or displayed in a grandmother’s cabinet — would become a global aesthetic icon?

Vintage cups are more than dishes.  
They’re snapshots of history, art pieces, collectibles, and tiny mood-setters that elevate even the simplest photo.

Maybe that’s the real magic:  
In a world where everything moves fast, a small vintage cup invites us to slow down—even if just long enough to take a picture.

On my bike, I pull a trailer with my camping gear that includes whichever 12V LiFePO4 batteries I have that are large enough for my expected load and time away from a recharging plug.  Again, no inverter.  Weight and size do not matter to me as long as I can carry it in a 5 gallon bucket.

Spent garland weighed down by pine cones and red and green string lights dangled from the Harren homestead, stinking of the melancholia and neglect that warps holiday decor festering well past its expiration date. A busy clothing line drooped like cobwebs between the family folk house and their dutch barn. Peter, the pot-bellied patriarch of the Harren quintet, had commissioned a team of stoic, yet diligent, Amish farm hands to build the barn not even ten years earlier to shelter the family’s dairy cow Rose, her feed, and Peter’s endless hoard of gasoline cans and rural machinery. But poor Rose had long been wilted from an outbreak of Actinobacillosis or “wooden tongue” and the once sturdy barn could barely lift its roof from the dirt. One part leaning gravestone, one part squirrel-infested storage. Beyond the barn and through the garment lines, three rolling acres of golden-tipped ryegrass swayed gently – mostly uniform in its overgrowth save for a Toddler-sized snow angel of blood red blades. 

As Baker pulled into the Harren’s driveway, osage oranges split underneath the tires of his ‘86 Crown Vic. The disproportionally loud shotgun pops were enough to electrify the 32 year old insufficiently caffeinated zombie up from his stupor and spill the top ¼ of his cup of Dunkin Donuts black coffee on his right pant leg.

I don’t usually write posts like this, but I decided to give myself a chance because, honestly, I’d like to meet someone I can build a real connection with. I’m not looking for sex or anything rushed. Just someone who treats me kindly during this moment in my life—someone who wants to truly get to know me and understands that loneliness can weigh on you sometimes.

I’d like to meet someone genuine and curious, someone who doesn’t project strange expectations onto me, and who enjoys talking, laughing, and actually listening. Someone who understands my sense of humor (which lives somewhere between gentle chaos and affectionate sarcasm) and who genuinely wants to know who I am.

A few things about me:
I love fantasy and romance, and I recently started reading the Dune saga because I’m a huge sci-fi fan. I’m also into comics, anime, and anything with a rich, imaginative world. I’m getting back into reading and writing because they make me feel more like myself, and I truly enjoy a cozy movie marathon with good company.

Physically, I’m a petite 5’2 blonde with green eyes and a soft, curvy body. Think of the vibe of someone who looks like she’d give warm hugs, get excited over fictional worlds, and make you laugh at the most random moments.

And yes… I’d also love an actual date. But an old-school one.
Going out for dinner, watching a movie, grabbing a coffee, taking a walk, talking without rushing. Nothing complicated. Just two people genuinely wanting to get to know each other.

Also, I speak both Spanish and English.

If you’re interested in a pressure-free connection filled with honesty, good humor, and the intention of treating each other kindly… I’m here.",0,1764519814.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

Been to dreams la romana maybe 2016 and loved it.  Before it changed to Hilton or Hyatt?  Now back to dreams.

I heard if you stay at secrets, you can use dreams, and vice versa, is that true?  Would stay at secrets, no kids. 

Thoughts on these two resorts at this point now?  I’m an all inclusive traveler, I expect food to be good, but not 5 star, I’m realistic. 

Does secrets have a late night food place, coffee desert place?  I don’t see one listed, only on dreams side.  It also looks like almost all secrets restaurants are outdoors, dreams look indoors.

So tonight we will show you what one lady (she isn’t here tonight)…but she gave me a series of stories based upon her technique. Let me now tell you something about the lady. She works for the telephone company, in fact, all of her life she’s been there. So she went in as a long distance operator and worked her way up to the chief operator—now she’s superintendent. But she trained herself to hear a voice. Even if the voice wasn’t there, she could actually hear it just as though the voice is speaking. It’s become so much a part of her that she can really hear what she wants to hear. So here in her office, an operator…she has a son Kenneth and Kenneth wanted to be a flyer, a jet flyer. Well, he was turned down by United, by TWA, by American, by all of them as too small—his arms weren’t long enough. So she said to Kenneth, “Get on the telephone and you phone me and you tell me over the phone that you’re flying jets and it’s wonderful! I will not answer…you just tell me that so I can hear your voice, and I will hang up.” So he got on the phone and called her, and told her that I’m flying jets and it’s perfectly marvelous, wonderful. She did exactly what she told him she would do, she hung up. Well, someone gave him a pass to Miami. So when he got to Miami he was employed by Eastern Airlines. They trained him, he’s now flying jets. Before that, the mother thought “I should send him to school, to some engineering school, prepare him in some way.” Well, no preparation…just someone gave him this pass, he goes to Miami, he’s flying for Eastern.

He called her on the wire, he said, “I want a lovely home in a nice neighborhood.” Then she hung up. Not “I want,” she had to reverse that and say, “I have a lovely home in a perfectly marvelous neighborhood…and I have a sports car.” She simply, after she found out, she tuned him in, heard the same voice declaring that he has a lovely home and a sports car. Well, he has it right on the golf course, she said on the telephone, owns on the golf course—all within four months.

The mother one day in the office said to her, “I want to sell Kenneth’s Jeep. He’s gone now so I want to sell the Jeep.” She said, Now, that’s not the way we do it. “Isn’t it wonderful I’ve sold the Jeep at a wonderful price!” Two weeks later in the office as I walked by she said to me at the desk, “Isn’t it wonderful, I’ve sold the Jeep at a wonderful price.” I said to myself, “Does she want me to hear it again? I’ve heard it.” But during the coffee break, as she came out, I said, “Did you really sell the Jeep?” She said, “Yes, I sold the Jeep. I sold it at the same price I paid for it years ago. He’s used it for years, and we got the same price for it that I paid for it years ago, so I call that a good price!”

This one now…you can pass judgment if you want to. Were I this lady, I would say to this one, “Do not tempt God.” For there are people in this world who would try to make you feel you are responsible for them forever and forever. This lady said to her, “I have no money and just an old car. I would like a new car.” So I said, “I’ll just change that whole picture and you will tell me that you have a new car.” Five days later she has a new Impala. But she tells my friend that it would have happened anyway—“you didn’t do it”—although she asked my friend to hear it—“but you didn’t do it.” Then she said to her, “Now, I’m going to test you. See this ticket? This is an Irish sweepstake ticket. This is a winning ticket, this ticket won.” Well, when the tickets were drawn it won $280. This lady goes through the ceiling because she didn’t win the $150,000 and bawls my friend out. My friend had made a little note and wrote the whole thing out and she had underscored the word “this”—this ticket won. Well, it did. That ticket won, it won 280. She paid practically nothing for it, but she was annoyed at my friend because she didn’t push it up to 150,000.

Welcome back, Week 13 is here! For anyone new, every week I take Vegas lines and odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings, FanDuel and OwnersBox salaries to calculate a value score. This helps highlight who's overpriced and who’s underpriced.

These plays tend to be chalky/high ownership, so I typically use them for double-ups, but you’re free to use the info however you want.

🔑 Core Plays

I run an optimizer for every slate to identify the strongest builds. Since sharing full lineups is against T&C (and would just have everyone running the same thing anyway), here are a few core plays the optimizer is high on:

* QB: TBD
* RB: Achane, Breece
* WR: Waddle
* TE: TBD
* DST: TBD

💸 Tip Jar (Optional)

If this saves you time and fattens your bankroll → Tip the nerd🤓🧪

* CashApp: $FirePropsEV
* Buy Me A Coffee: FirePropsEV

📊 Full Table

Full filterable table with DraftKings, FanDuel and OwnersBox can be found in my FREE Substack. Hope you enjoy, good luck!
