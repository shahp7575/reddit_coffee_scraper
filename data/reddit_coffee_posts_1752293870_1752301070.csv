For reference: The point where this photo was taken connects to a dining room (behind pov) and a staircase (going down) to the right. To the left of the shelf on the far left corner is another entry way. To the far right of the living room is an entryway to the backyard.
Essentially open/wanting to get rid of and replace all of the furniture other than the piano. I know the layout can be better but have a really hard time visualizing or understanding what wools be best. 
Definitely want a smaller coffee table. Would love it to feel more cozy, bright, open. 

Any ideas or AI renditions will be greatly appreciated!

Basically the people I know are from my work and I’m very social so I need the interaction.
I was advised by a friend to download Bumble app since it worked (so he says) quite well here in Munich.
I now have my profile, but the thing is - this is a dating app and I just want someone to go for a coffee or a drink, have a walk, talk about whatever comes in mind without judgment, etc.
I am married and have a kid (which I putted on my profile), but don’t want to give the wrong impression (I chose the “ocasional encounters” option). My family didn’t move with me (don’t know if that will happen actually or if it does, by when), so would be nice to have the socialisation.

Is this ok? I mean - are there more people like me just trying to get some company for these kind of things, or should I be searching for another app?",1,1752300933.0,Bumble,0,1.0,False

1lxtco2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1lxtco2/do_these_problems_warrant_a_4star_host_review_us/,Do these problems warrant a 4-star host review? [US],"I’ve been a guest on Airbnb for over a decade and have never left a host less than a 5-star review. However there were two issues at my most recent visit that I feel like are significant enough to warrant a deduction from the standard 5-star, but I would like some feedback since I know a 4-star review hurts hosts.

Cons of the Stay
1. ANTS!  I am familiar with ant problems as I’m from the region that the Airbnb is located. My childhood home has an ant issue that had to be managed with routine cleanliness & insect terminators. However, before we EVER brought food into the house (day one of the visit) we noticed a ton of ants in the bathroom of the home, which was odd because obviously, there was no food in the bathroom. I did notice though that there were some ant traps on an outside windowsill of the house, and one in the bathroom and kitchen, so at the very least, the host is aware of this issue. I feel like the ant issue would be something that should have been shared with us. On the first night my brother moved his stuff outside of his bedroom because there were so many ants crawling on the floor of his room. 

2. Host not replying to us. The hosts typical response time provided by Airbnb was 6 hours, so that is what I was expecting. However, the hosts’ fastest response time was 24 hours, to which they completely ignored the question I had asked (about how much the laundry room fees were), and the slowest was over a week (when I had asked before coming to the home if an early check-in was allowed). The evening before check-out, I asked the host some specifics about if there were any ant bait traps that they had in the house and also if there were any check-out instructions for the bedding and towels, and even though I saw that the host saw the message a few hours later, they did not reply. Things like this made the experience a bit frustrating.

Pros
Besides the ant issue, the house was very clean and exactly as pictured, and the instructions for check in were clear. I also liked that they had provided towels, soaps, and all of the kitchen essentials + extra goodies like coffee pods and sugar.

1lxtbzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lxtbzm/keep_your_eyes_closed/,Keep your eyes closed.,"“If you feel scared while you’re dreaming, stay in that dream.

If the fear ignites your skin, wrapping around your throat while you blissfully dream, stay asleep.

If you hear a noise that wakes you up out of your control, keep your eyes closed.

If you hear footsteps that you can’t place, keep your eyes closed.

If you feel something touch you, no matter what it feels like, keep your eyes closed.

If something speaks to you, even if you recognize its voice, keep your eyes closed.

Closed eyes until the crest of the sun shines through the window.”

I have had these words engrained on my mind for the last few days, since I awoke to my worst nightmare realized.

My beloved Bobby.

My perfect, kind, sweet fiancé. Who never hurt a fly.

My wonderful Bobby laying next to me, eyes open in terror, mouth fully opened in a silent scream. Staring at the ceiling.

I screamed when I awoke to him and saw his state, I cried and checked his pulse. Crying out his name for him to come back to me.

“Bobby! Bobby! Wake up! Don’t leave me, please don’t leave me here alone!”, I sobbed.

Once the police had come and asked me a million questions, and the coroner had collected his body, the police asked me one more thing.

“Is there a camera?”, the officer asked me.

“We have one in the living room that faces the kitchen, it’s wired to our phones.”, I responded, wiping my tears with my shirt sleeve.

“We will be needing access to that,” he said, clicking his pen away, “Just to check on some things.”

“You mean.. to check if I somehow killed him with something from the kitchen?”, I asked, rage filling my eyes.

“We have to rule it out Miss, don’t take it personally.”, he grumbled.

Once the officers had cleared out of our home, he turned to me once more.

“And for what it’s worth, I’m sorry for your loss.” He said with a frown.

Then he was gone.

I couldn’t sleep a wink the next night. After calling everyone we knew, and delivering the bad news over and over while fielding questions I couldn’t answer, I was exhausted.

Exhausted but wide awake.

I couldn’t sleep in our bed, that was our bed. I couldn’t smell Bobby there.

So I made myself a spot on our couch.

I put on a show, and tried scrolling through my phone when I saw I had a new email.

It was the detective assigned to Bobby’s case, who asked to see the footage from last night.

I sighed, and opened my camera app.

I exported all the footage for the last 24 hours and sent it over with a highly unsatisfying woosh.

I couldn’t bring myself to look at it.

I couldn’t see us cuddled up on the couch together, laughing while watching a movie.

I couldn’t take more pain.

Once the tears began to flow again, I locked my phone screen and left it on the coffee table.

I tossed and turned for what felt like hours, until I finally drifted off.

I dreamt of me sitting in a lonely bus station, I seemed to have no destination as I watched people get on and off their buses and go on their way.

I sat still, watching the passengers, when I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise.

I turned around, and found no one watching me. Actually, the station in my dream had emptied, but the feeling had stayed.

I kept looking backwards, looking for the cause of my paranoia, when the color of the bench I was sitting on turned from blue to pink.

Oh, I’m dreaming.

I watched the colors, and wished I could say goodbye to Bobby. When my cellphone rang.

It was apparently in my pocket, and I held it up to my ear.

I hit answer, but the phone continued to ring loudly.

“Hello? Hello?”

I hear muffled words through the dream phone.

And a familiar voice.

“Bobby? Bobby???”, I asked, in a new panic.

His voice was muffled, mixed with static, and the ringing.

But I could make out a few words.

“Don’t… Wake… Close.. Eyes!!!!”

The ringing from my phone grew louder and louder, and I felt myself waking up.

“Why??”, I screamed into the phone.

“It’s.. Not… Me..!”

I feel myself fading more and more from the dream.

“What’s not you??”, I scream.

“It’s…. WAITING!”

My eyes shot open.

In my delirious state, I looked around my dark house, then at my coffee table which held my traitorous phone ringing loudly.

My brother calling me back, after his night shift.

I swipe the call to answer and run my hands through my hair.

“Hey Jay….”, I mumble.

After another tearful call, I put my phone back and lay down on the couch again, putting my hands over my face. Sighing deeply.

Then I hear it.

A soft clink of glass.

I freeze, hands still over my face, covering my eyes.

Another soft clink.

My breathing turns harder, and I know my hands have started to tremble.

I then hear footsteps walking towards me, a low growl emitting from the direction of my kitchen.

I stay frozen.

“Babe? Babe, are you here?”

Bobby.

I start to cry in relief, and begin to move my hands when Bobby’s words from my dream haunt me.

“It’s.. not.. me!”

I freeze again.

“Baby, there you are. It’s me, wake up baby, oh I missed you.”

I still don’t move.

My dream felt so real, maybe I am dreaming again, and if it’s really Bobby he will still be here by morning.

“Babe? Come on..”

I feel cold hands grip my wrists, tugging lightly to pull them off my eyes, but I hold strong.

“Move your hands. Now.”, Bobby’s voice demands.

The cold hands grip me harder, trying to yank my arms down, but I hold on.

That’s not my Bobby. Bobby has never spoken to me coldly and he would never grab me like this.

“Move them or I will take my time with you too.”, his voice seethes at me.

Too.

I’m sobbing, but I keep my eyes covered, my hands violently shake.

And for hours, Bobby insults me, yells at me, pleads with me, bargains with me, just to move my hands.

But I don’t.

After it was quiet for a while, I felt the warmth of the sun start to rise through our window.

I shakily move my hands down, and find no one there.

I whimper, because I wanted to be wrong.

I get out a piece a paper and write down every lesson I learned that night, and that whatever this thing is, it most likely took my Bobby.

I’m tucking the piece of paper into my phone case for safe keeping when I get a call from an unknown number.

“Hello?”

“Hello, this is Detective Michaels. I’ve been working Bobby’s case.”, a gruff voice answers.

“Oh, yes. Yes, I’m here. Have you found anything?”, I ask, wrapping my blanket around my shoulders.

“Well we analyzed your living room camera, and we found Bobby. He woke up at about 2am and walked to your living room, he just stood there for a few minutes facing the wall. Then, he turned and went back to your room.”, he said, I could hear his pen scribbling something down through the phone.

“Okay..”, I tell him, willing him to keep going.

“And the coroner got back to me just a few minutes ago, and we can clear you off this case from their findings.”

“What did you find?”, I ask timidly.

“Well.. it appears Bobby had a type of heart attack in his sleep..”, he continues.

“A heart attack? He was perfectly healthy!”, I snapped, still protective over him.

“This wasn’t.. It wasn’t a health thing, Miss. It didn’t go on the official report..”, he paused, and lowered his voice into the phone, “I’ll tell you what the coroner told me, and she said it’s just what she thinks but she’s never seen something like this before.”

“Please tell me.”, I demand.

“She said.. She said that with how Bobby’s face was, that he saw something. We don’t know what.. But…”, he trailed off.

“But what?”

“She says she thinks he was frightened to death.”

I pause.

“That’s not possible.. that’s not real. That can’t happen..”, I mutter into the phone.

“It can.. It is rare, but not impossible.”, the detective corrects.

I’m silent, what could Bobby have seen to.. to… I can’t even think it.

“And Miss.. a word of advice.”, Detective Michael whispers.

I’m silent.

“All I’m saying, is that if my partner was scared to death right next to me, and it didn’t even wake me up, I would only think of one thing to do..”, He says, while rustling a piece of paper in the background.

“What’s that?”, I ask.

“Move. Sell your place, go far away. And pray to whatever you believe in that it won’t come looking for you next.”, he explains.

“But Detective.. what if it already has?”, I ask.

He’s silent for a moment.

“Well, then I’ll start praying for you too.”",1,1752300754.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

This is Part 9 of Second Watch. Two years have passed. Jeff has done the work. And on the other side, something real waits. 

⸻

Chapter 10: Ascent into the Light

Two years passed.

Not quickly.
Not painlessly.
But with purpose.

⸻

Jeff didn't waste his time behind bars.

At first, he kept his head down. Shoulders tight. Silence as armor.

But prison had its own rhythm. Eventually, he moved within it.

He joined a book circle run by the chaplain—stumbled through pages at first. Then he started journaling. At first to himself.

Then to Katie.

⸻

The first letter was two lines.
The second, three.
The fifth filled a page.

By the tenth, he told her about the books he was reading. The guys he was tutoring for GED prep. The things he was starting to forgive himself for.

Katie always responded. Not always long letters—but real ones. Honest. Sometimes hopeful. Sometimes heavy.

⸻

Eventually, Jeff began tutoring during rec hours. His teaching style was a mess of metaphors and sarcasm, but it worked. A few of the guys passed their exams.

One even said, ""Thanks, Doc.""

Jeff didn't correct him.

⸻

He started sending some of his commissary earnings—along with a handwritten apology—to Vanessa.
By the time his release date approached, she'd been paid back in full.

She never wrote back.

He didn't expect her to.

That wasn't the point.

⸻

Katie changed, too.

On a call one afternoon, she said she'd shut down half her platform. Started over. Built something new.

""It's called Real Reels. A docuseries. Stories that matter. Veterans. Survivors. People in recovery.""

Jeff was silent.

""You made me want that,"" she said.

He didn't know what to say.

⸻

Near the end of his sentence, she mentioned someone new.

Evan.
Harm reduction advocate.
Good heart.
Met him at an outreach event.

Jeff didn't flinch.

""Is he good to you?""

""The best.""

""Then I'm happy for you.""

And he meant it.

Katie hesitated.

""I still keep your medal in my nightstand.""

""You don't have to,"" he said.

""I know,"" she replied. ""That's kind of the point.""

⸻

The Day of His Release

She met him outside the gate.

They didn't cry. Didn't run into each other's arms.

She just handed him the velvet pouch.

""I kept it safe.""

He held it for a moment before slipping it into his coat.

""Feels heavier.""

""It should,"" she said.

⸻

They went for coffee.

Talked about all the middle parts—the quiet moments no one ever writes stories about.

She didn't offer more than a hug.
He didn't ask for more than that.

But when she stood to leave, she reached into her coat.

""I almost forgot.""

She handed him a brochure.

Folded. Simple.
A name. A logo. A mission.

SECOND WATCH

""It's a nonprofit now. Outreach. Mentorship. Recovery.""

Jeff didn't speak.

""No one else could,"" she said.

Something in his chest cracked open.
Not in pain.

Just enough to let the light in.

I made a pot just now and it’s probably the worst coffee I’ve ever tasted, and I’m not nearly as picky as some. There is a strong taste of nuts that reminds me a bit of Nutella (hazelnut?) but it is not a fresh smell and instead tastes like something that’s been defrosted.

I assume others’ experiences are similar although please let me know if there’s a particular way to make this that improves the flavour.

Falmouth police confirmed the incident, saying that the agents took the man following a traffic stop.

“They reported this to us because the vehicle was left roadside. We were not notified prior that they were operating in town,” said Police Lieutenant Ryan Hergt.

A video of the incident was forward to the Enterprise by a bystander.

In the video, the three agents, wearing vests marked with “Police”, “ATF - Police” and “FBI,” can be seen leading a handcuffed man in shorts, white sneakers and a red hooded sweatshirt to a black unmarked SUV and placing him in the rear seat.

One of the agents was wearing dark glasses and a mask pulled up over his nose.

Bystanders can be heard shouting at the agents, saying “You’re being filmed,” “You’re disgusting,” “Have you identified yourselves?” and “Show us your badge.”

The masked agent then gestures to the FBI printed on the front of his vest.

“That’s not an ID,” someone shouts.

Another agent, this one with his bearded face exposed, points to a patch on his chest.

“That’s not a badge,” someone shouts.

The masked agent then removes a gold badge in a black case from his pocket and flashes it at the person shooting the video.

The bystanders continue to shout at the agents as they get into two other unmarked vehicles and drive away.

“It’s disgusting what you’re doing,” they shout, “Get out of our town,” ""Show us who you are, cowards” and “Shame on you.”

Heather M.H. Goldstone was among those who witnessed the incident. 

She said when she arrived at Coffee Obsession just before 9 o'clock for a morning meeting, she saw three dark colored SUVs or minivans and a white vehicle stopped on the side of the road.

""At first I thought it was a fender-bender,"" she said. ""Then I saw the agents and knew they weren't Falmouth police.""

She said she immediately called the LUCE hotline, which is a Massachusetts-based resource for reporting and responding to immigration-related activities, particularly those involving ICE.

She said when the agents left with the man, they left his car running in the street. She said a bystander eventually moved the vehicle into the lot across the street.

""I'm still rattled,"" she said, hours after the incident. 

Goldstone is a member of the Falmouth Select Board. The board, just last week, came out with **a strongly-worded letter** against ICE for failing to abide by constitutional procedures. In the statement, the board said ICE was feeding a “climate of fear” that is growing in town. 

“We do not dispute the rights and responsibilities of federal officials to enforce the laws of our country. However, it is essential that it be done in ways that respect and uphold constitutional and civil rights to freedom from unlawful discrimination, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, freedom from self-incrimination, and access to due process under the law,” the statement reads.

Chapter 8: The Weight of Honor

Katie brought food.

Not just a burrito wrapped in foil or fast food in a greasy sack—this was actual, warm food. Arroz con pollo in a reused Tupperware container. A side of black beans. Homemade cookies wrapped in wax paper.

The kind of thing you brought when you weren't just being kind.

The kind of thing you brought when you were saying: I see you.

⸻

Jeff was sitting alone near the edge of the Las Vegas Rescue Mission courtyard, a cracked concrete table serving as his desk for a worn paperback and a cup of coffee. His fingers traced the edge of the medal Katie had returned to him days earlier—turning it slowly in his hand like it might whisper something if he just listened long enough.

He looked up when she approached.

""You again,"" he said.

""Thought you might be tired of stale pastries and burnt coffee.""

She set the food down, then the napkin, then a small folded slip of paper.

They sat in silence for a while, the tension between them coiled but familiar.

""I've been thinking,"" Katie said. ""This world—mine—is insane. Bright lights. Brand deals. No depth. But... I want to help. If you'll let me.""

Jeff shook his head slowly.

""You've got a good heart, Katie. But I'm not ready.""

""You don't have to do it alone.""

""I know,"" he said. Then after a long pause: ""But I have to do it right.""

⸻

Katie looked at him carefully. ""What does that mean?""

Jeff looked down at the medal again.

""It means I've burned a lot of bridges. Lied. Stolen. Hurt people who tried to help me.""

""There was a woman—Vanessa. She gave me a place to stay. I repaid her by stealing her rent money.""

Katie didn't flinch. Just listened.

""I thought I was surviving. But the truth is—I stopped caring. I stopped showing up.""

""I've got warrants. Stuff I ran from.""

He reached into his jacket and pulled out a folded piece of paper.

""If I want to be the guy in that photo again—hell, if I want to be someone who deserves to wear this medal—I have to face it. All of it.""

Katie's breath caught.

""You're turning yourself in?""

Jeff nodded. ""It's the only way. I want to be clean. Not just sober. And that means I can't keep living like the past didn't happen.""

She didn't speak for a long time.

When she finally did, her voice was soft:

""You saved my life. And now you're disappearing.""

""I'm not disappearing,"" Jeff said. ""I'm finally showing up.""

He reached into his pocket and pulled out the medal. His thumb brushed the worn surface one last time.

""Will you hold onto this?""

Katie looked stunned. ""Jeff...""

""Just until I can earn it back,"" he said. ""I don't want to carry it until I deserve to.""

She hesitated. Then reached out. Her hands closed around it like she was holding something more than brass and ribbon—something fragile. Something alive.

""Okay,"" she whispered.

Katie scribbled her email onto the napkin and pushed it across the table.

""Write me. I don't care where you are. Just... don't disappear completely.""

He folded it carefully and tucked it into his coat like something sacred.

""I won't,"" he said. ""I promise.""

I’m moving in the next month so I’m not super worried but still. Make it known that the reason I’m moving is because this woman is paranoid and just straight up a bitch. She’s accused me of stealing random things (mostly random food items, like cooking oil, butter, coffee, sugar. cheese, ect. Literally anything she could think of, Iv some how touched 💀), she told me when I moved in that she didn’t have people over, she has people over all the time. 

I found out that she lied to me about not renewing the lease and she wants me out, and changed the date so I’m just leaving a few months early because I don’t want to deal with her a minute longer

Point of my post, I’m pretty sure the last few months she’s been having people over to annoy me into leaving. In the middle of the week while I’m working (I work from home) random people will come over with her. They then stay for days on end, some times over a week. They trash my bathroom and eat up all her food (which she admits, but won’t admit that it’s a possibility they are the ones touching her food, even after saying she knows they have ate her food before.) it’s only guys that are over too. I know for a fact she is doing drugs with them and then LOUDLY having sex with them thought the whole house, it’s fucking gross. But there are also times where she will bring guys over and they will just stay on the couch all day even when she is gone. She just leaves them in the house… she has told me that they are “friends” but then I over hear them loudly talking and it’s very clear that these guys are just strangers.

I think a good portion of the guys, not all of them but some of them, she’s been renting out the couch too without telling me. It makes me extremely uncomfortable because the living room is open to the kitchen so when I go to the kitchen I’m having these random guys just stare at me like I’m a weirdo but I’m the one renting a room. She never tells me when she is bring them over so Iv just decided to start locking my bedroom door because it creeps me out that she lest random men into our apartment at any given time of the day. She’s literally brought them home at 2-3 in the morning sometimes.

I don’t think I’m going to say anything because I’m leaving soon but still this has been one of the weirdest roommates I have ever had.

Author Note:
This is Part 6 of Second Watch. In this chapter, Jeff finally speaks his truth—and begins the long road toward real accountability. 

⸻

Chapter 7: No Excuses

The picture and medal Katie gave Jeff were tucked carefully into the pocket of his coat—a coat that had once been stolen from a donation bin and still bore the faded name of someone else on the inside tag.

He touched the edge of the photo like it might vanish if he blinked too hard.

That man had a name. A rank. A purpose.

Standing in the quiet back corner of the Las Vegas Rescue Mission, Jeff didn't know how to become him again.

But he wanted to try.

⸻

He started showing up. Not just at NA meetings, but early—setting up chairs, sweeping floors, pouring burnt coffee into paper cups. He listened. At first in silence. Then more attentively. Until finally, one night, he spoke.

""My name's Jeff,"" he said, clearing his throat. ""I was a Navy corpsman. I served in Ramadi and Helmand. I saw people bleed out that I couldn't save. I patched up kids younger than my little brother until they stopped breathing in my hands.""

He looked down at his calloused fingers.

""I earned a medal once, but I didn't keep it. I thought letting it go would let the guilt go too. It didn't.""

""I got kicked out. Dishonorable. I hit my CO after he called my friends collateral damage.""

The room was quiet.

""I've done worse since. I slept in tunnels. I used. I stole. I betrayed people who helped me because I didn't think I deserved anything good.""

He paused. Eyes steady now.

""There was a woman. Vanessa. She gave me a couch, a chance. I paid her back by taking what she had and walking out.""

""I see her face when I sleep. I hear what she said: that I made her stop believing people can change.""

He pulled the photo from his coat.

""But someone gave me this. A picture of who I used to be. A reminder that maybe that guy isn't gone—just buried. And every time I look at it, I wonder if I've really earned it back.""

His voice cracked.

""I don't want this to be a lie. I want to prove I've changed. Even if it costs me.""

Stillness.

Then a quiet nod from Manny in the back row.

⸻

After the meeting, Manny clapped a hand on Jeff's shoulder.

""That was real,"" he said. ""That kind of honesty? That's the stuff that saves people.""

Jeff just nodded. He didn't need praise. He just wanted to be useful.

In the following days, he helped escort a detoxing kid to the ER. Broke up a fight outside the shelter. Carried boxes for an elderly woman with a twisted ankle. He didn't talk about it.

He just did it.

⸻

Flashback – Denver, 2 Years After Discharge

Snow fell thick and slow. Jeff woke up on a park bench wrapped around a trash bag full of stolen clothes. His boots were soaked. One was missing a sole. His breath fogged like a ghost that didn't want to leave.

There was a bottle in his jacket. Half gin. Half regret.

Another night. Another blackout.

⸻

Six Months Later – Albuquerque

He met Vanessa at a church outreach. She was kind. Thirtyish. Divorced. Worked two jobs. She let him crash on her couch. Bought groceries. Gave him clean clothes.

Jeff got clean for three weeks.

Then he found her pills.

Then he remembered how easy it was to disappear.

He stole her laptop. Told her he got mugged.

Took the money from her rent envelope. Promised he'd pay her back.

He didn't.

When she found out, she didn't scream.

Didn't cry.

She just stood there—photo of her kid in one hand, empty envelope in the other.

""You didn't just steal from me,"" she said. ""You made me stop believing people can change.""

He didn't argue.

Didn't explain.

There was no excuse.

He left.

⸻

Present – Las Vegas Shelter

Jeff sat on his cot with the tin box in his lap. Inside: the photo. The medal. The dog tags he still wore like a secret scar.

He whispered their names: Martinez. Bishop. Cho.

Only one of them was still breathing.

He lit a cigarette and stared into the glow.

""I used to love Lord of the Rings,"" he murmured. ""Camped out for midnight premieres. Slept in my car and still made PT.""

He smirked.

""Everyone wanted to be Aragorn. Or Sam. I wanted to be Gollum.""

A pause.

""He was good once. Whole. But he touched the dark and it never let go.""

He placed the medal beside the photo.

""I wore this for surviving. They died trying to live with honor. What the hell have I done with mine?""

The light above flickered.

Then steadied.

Jeff whispered:

""No more excuses.""",1,1752300309.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1lxt7e3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lxt7e3/keep_your_eyes_closed/,Keep your eyes closed.,"“If you feel scared while you’re dreaming, stay in that dream.

If the fear ignites your skin, wrapping around your throat while you blissfully dream, stay asleep.

If you hear a noise that wakes you up out of your control, keep your eyes closed.

If you hear footsteps that you can’t place, keep your eyes closed.

If you feel something touch you, no matter what it feels like, keep your eyes closed.

If something speaks to you, even if you recognize its voice, keep your eyes closed.

Closed eyes until the crest of the sun shines through the window.”

I have had these words engrained on my mind for the last few days, since I awoke to my worst nightmare realized.

My beloved Bobby.

My perfect, kind, sweet fiancé. Who never hurt a fly.

My wonderful Bobby laying next to me, eyes open in terror, mouth fully opened in a silent scream. Staring at the ceiling.

I screamed when I awoke to him and saw his state, I cried and checked his pulse. Crying out his name for him to come back to me.

“Bobby! Bobby! Wake up! Don’t leave me, please don’t leave me here alone!”, I sobbed.

Once the police had come and asked me a million questions, and the coroner had collected his body, the police asked me one more thing.

“Is there a camera?”, the officer asked me.

“We have one in the living room that faces the kitchen, it’s wired to our phones.”, I responded, wiping my tears with my shirt sleeve.

“We will be needing access to that,” he said, clicking his pen away, “Just to check on some things.”

“You mean.. to check if I somehow killed him with something from the kitchen?”, I asked, rage filling my eyes.

“We have to rule it out Miss, don’t take it personally.”, he grumbled.

Once the officers had cleared out of our home, he turned to me once more.

“And for what it’s worth, I’m sorry for your loss.” He said with a frown.

Then he was gone.

I couldn’t sleep a wink the next night. After calling everyone we knew, and delivering the bad news over and over while fielding questions I couldn’t answer, I was exhausted.

Exhausted but wide awake.

I couldn’t sleep in our bed, that was our bed. I couldn’t smell Bobby there.

So I made myself a spot on our couch.

I put on a show, and tried scrolling through my phone when I saw I had a new email.

It was the detective assigned to Bobby’s case, who asked to see the footage from last night.

I sighed, and opened my camera app.

I exported all the footage for the last 24 hours and sent it over with a highly unsatisfying woosh.

I couldn’t bring myself to look at it.

I couldn’t see us cuddled up on the couch together, laughing while watching a movie.

I couldn’t take more pain.

Once the tears began to flow again, I locked my phone screen and left it on the coffee table.

I tossed and turned for what felt like hours, until I finally drifted off.

I dreamt of me sitting in a lonely bus station, I seemed to have no destination as I watched people get on and off their buses and go on their way.

I sat still, watching the passengers, when I felt the hair on the back of my neck rise.

I turned around, and found no one watching me. Actually, the station in my dream had emptied, but the feeling had stayed.

I kept looking backwards, looking for the cause of my paranoia, when the color of the bench I was sitting on turned from blue to pink.

Oh, I’m dreaming.

I watched the colors, and wished I could say goodbye to Bobby. When my cellphone rang.

It was apparently in my pocket, and I held it up to my ear.

I hit answer, but the phone continued to ring loudly.

“Hello? Hello?”

I hear muffled words through the dream phone.

And a familiar voice.

“Bobby? Bobby???”, I asked, in a new panic.

His voice was muffled, mixed with static, and the ringing.

But I could make out a few words.

“Don’t… Wake… Close.. Eyes!!!!”

The ringing from my phone grew louder and louder, and I felt myself waking up.

“Why??”, I screamed into the phone.

“It’s.. Not… Me..!”

I feel myself fading more and more from the dream.

“What’s not you??”, I scream.

“It’s…. WAITING!”

My eyes shot open.

In my delirious state, I looked around my dark house, then at my coffee table which held my traitorous phone ringing loudly.

My brother calling me back, after his night shift.

I swipe the call to answer and run my hands through my hair.

“Hey Jay….”, I mumble.

After another tearful call, I put my phone back and lay down on the couch again, putting my hands over my face. Sighing deeply.

Then I hear it.

A soft clink of glass.

I freeze, hands still over my face, covering my eyes.

Another soft clink.

My breathing turns harder, and I know my hands have started to tremble.

I then hear footsteps walking towards me, a low growl emitting from the direction of my kitchen.

I stay frozen.

“Babe? Babe, are you here?”

Bobby.

I start to cry in relief, and begin to move my hands when Bobby’s words from my dream haunt me.

“It’s.. not.. me!”

I freeze again.

“Baby, there you are. It’s me, wake up baby, oh I missed you.”

I still don’t move.

My dream felt so real, maybe I am dreaming again, and if it’s really Bobby he will still be here by morning.

“Babe? Come on..”

I feel cold hands grip my wrists, tugging lightly to pull them off my eyes, but I hold strong.

“Move your hands. Now.”, Bobby’s voice demands.

The cold hands grip me harder, trying to yank my arms down, but I hold on.

That’s not my Bobby. Bobby has never spoken to me coldly and he would never grab me like this.

“Move them or I will take my time with you too.”, his voice seethes at me.

Too.

I’m sobbing, but I keep my eyes covered, my hands violently shake.

And for hours, Bobby insults me, yells at me, pleads with me, bargains with me, just to move my hands.

But I don’t.

After it was quiet for a while, I felt the warmth of the sun start to rise through our window.

I shakily move my hands down, and find no one there.

I whimper, because I wanted to be wrong.

I get out a piece a paper and write down every lesson I learned that night, and that whatever this thing is, it most likely took my Bobby.

I’m tucking the piece of paper into my phone case for safe keeping when I get a call from an unknown number.

“Hello?”

“Hello, this is Detective Michaels. I’ve been working Bobby’s case.”, a gruff voice answers.

“Oh, yes. Yes, I’m here. Have you found anything?”, I ask, wrapping my blanket around my shoulders.

“Well we analyzed your living room camera, and we found Bobby. He woke up at about 2am and walked to your living room, he just stood there for a few minutes facing the wall. Then, he turned and went back to your room.”, he said, I could hear his pen scribbling something down through the phone.

“Okay..”, I tell him, willing him to keep going.

“And the coroner got back to me just a few minutes ago, and we can clear you off this case from their findings.”

“What did you find?”, I ask timidly.

“Well.. it appears Bobby had a type of heart attack in his sleep..”, he continues.

“A heart attack? He was perfectly healthy!”, I snapped, still protective over him.

“This wasn’t.. It wasn’t a health thing, Miss. It didn’t go on the official report..”, he paused, and lowered his voice into the phone, “I’ll tell you what the coroner told me, and she said it’s just what she thinks but she’s never seen something like this before.”

“Please tell me.”, I demand.

“She said.. She said that with how Bobby’s face was, that he saw something. We don’t know what.. But…”, he trailed off.

“But what?”

“She says she thinks he was frightened to death.”

I pause.

“That’s not possible.. that’s not real. That can’t happen..”, I mutter into the phone.

“It can.. It is rare, but not impossible.”, the detective corrects.

I’m silent, what could Bobby have seen to.. to… I can’t even think it.

“And Miss.. a word of advice.”, Detective Michael whispers.

I’m silent.

“All I’m saying, is that if my partner was scared to death right next to me, and it didn’t even wake me up, I would only think of one thing to do..”, He says, while rustling a piece of paper in the background.

“What’s that?”, I ask.

“Move. Sell your place, go far away. And pray to whatever you believe in that it won’t come looking for you next.”, he explains.

“But Detective.. what if it already has?”, I ask.

He’s silent for a moment.

“Well, then I’ll start praying for you too.”

This is Part 5 of Second Watch, a gritty story about broken people, quiet reckonings, and hard-earned growth. Jeff and Katie's friendship begins to take root here. Catch up on earlier parts.

⸻

Chapter 6: Mirrors and Flashlights

The shelter was quieter than usual that morning. The low hum of fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, barely audible beneath the soft rustling of donated clothes and quiet murmurs between volunteers.

Jeff sat near the corner table—his table now—picking at the remains of a banana muffin he hadn't asked for.

It had been almost a month since Katie and Jeff first met. She came by every few days or so. Always brought food. Real food. Always waited for him to acknowledge her—sometimes he did, sometimes he didn't. But she kept coming anyway.

This morning, she brought a thermos of black coffee and a paper bag that smelled like it came from an actual bakery. A peace offering. She hadn't said the words, but the hesitation in her eyes made it clear. She was nervous. Not scared—just careful.

""You didn't have to keep bringing me food,"" Jeff muttered.

""I know,"" she said. ""But I wanted to. You saved my life. This seemed like the least I could do.""

They sat in a long silence. Jeff sipped from the thermos—black, just how he used to drink it back when he had a morning routine and somewhere to be. His fingers tightened around the metal. The warmth grounded him.

""I've been doing some digging,"" Katie finally said. ""About you.""

His eyes flicked up. There was no anger in them. Just weariness.

""How much do you know?""

""I found a picture,"" she said. ""From a combat tour in Fallujah. You were smiling. It didn't look fake.""

Jeff let out a soft exhale through his nose. ""That was a lifetime ago.""

""I also found a medal. In a pawn shop. You threw it away, didn't you?""

He didn't answer. Just nodded once.

""Didn't feel like I earned it.""

""You did,"" Katie said quietly, placing both the photo and the medal on the table between them. ""And even if you don't believe it yet—I do.""

Jeff stared at the items. The photo showed him and his team—laughing, arms slung around each other in a huddle of sweat-streaked faces and desert dust. His throat tightened.

He reached out and brushed the edge of the picture with calloused fingers.

""I remember their names,"" he whispered. ""Martinez. Bishop. Cho. All gone.""

The weight of memory settled on his shoulders.

Katie didn't reach for him. Didn't interrupt.

""Why did you stop believing in yourself?"" she finally asked.

Jeff didn't look up.

""Because I survived. And they didn't.""

⸻

They sat in silence. It stretched, but it wasn't empty.

Jeff finally glanced at her, a genuine question behind his tired eyes.

""What got you into... all this?"" he asked. ""Being an influencer. Public life.""

She exhaled and looked away.

""I started all this to help a friend. Back in high school. She was getting bullied and I made dumb little videos to cheer her up. Defended her. Made people laugh.""

She smiled faintly. ""It worked. People paid attention.""

Her fingers tapped the paper bag lightly.

""But then it turned into something else. Followers. Sponsorships. Image. I kept creating—but it all became polished. Safe. Controlled. It wasn't fake... just edited. Everything I shared was a mirror. I held it up to get approval.""

She looked back at him.

""But then you pulled me out of that car and didn't even stick around. You didn't want credit. You just... acted. Like it meant something.""

Jeff studied her for a long moment. Then he said quietly:

""You've gotten used to holding up a mirror when you should be holding up a flashlight.""

Katie blinked. Like the words struck something deeper than she expected.

""A flashlight?"" she repeated.

""Yeah,"" he said. ""A mirror shows people who they already are. A flashlight helps them see where they're going.""

Katie nodded slowly.

""Okay. Flashlight it is.""

The silence between them changed.

It became easier.

She stood, gathering her things.

""You don't have to do anything, Jeff. I just wanted you to have these."" Her voice softened. ""They belonged to you. Not the shadows.""

Jeff stared after her as she walked away—not back into the world of filters and brand deals, but toward something real. Toward light.

And maybe, just maybe...

You invited me in the moment you opened this post. “Invited who?” you ask. You’ve been calling to me your entire life. Those quiet moments. The angry ones too. The ones where you stared at that door, knowing damn well that the consequence lay on the other side, and opened it anyway.

Let me get a good look at you. Ah… yes. I remember that face. I wore you often. It suits you, ya know. I’m glad you took it back. Would it comfort you if I introduced myself? Not yet…

What’s also stumping you is the nature of my game. I’ve been painted evil from a hypocrites brush. You think I offer bargains. I don’t. I offer reflections that people hate to look at too long.

You want to know who I am?

I am the silence before a gunshot that invaded a Kennedy’s thoughts. I was the applause when they chose a criminal over Jesus. You people chose a monster over Jesus… Tuh. I am the doubt in the surgeon’s hand that had too much coffee. I can be a man of wealth and taste but above all, I’m inevitable.

This is the nature of the game. Want to know how I play? Choice. Dialogue.

I don’t tell you, “get rid of them.” I say: “Aren’t you tired of being wronged all the time?” I don’t whisper “burn them the way that they burned you.” I say: “Haven’t they taken enough from you?” I don’t shout, “betray them with the same heart they betrayed you with.” I say: “You deserve better.” Free will tastes better when it’s dressed like justice. And so you choose. Over and over again.

And I never have to force your hand. That’s not the nature of MY game. No, my silly. I simply offer… a nudge. Just remember the next time you try to see how long you can stare at your reflection… remember to say:

“I made this choice.”

And you did. But I was there. Pleased to meet you. Hope you guessed my name.

But wait, there’s more. I watched your hands hover over the delete key after writing something cruel. I remember the hesitation you had before pressing it anyway. I listened to you say a lie because the other person believed you to be truthful.

You never needed me to commit sin. You just needed someone to blame for enjoying it. So you chose the obvious answer. Then you have the nerve to go to church for forgiveness with every intention of repeating your sins.

You talk in your sleep, did you know that? You say the funniest things.

You once wondered if hell is fire or ice. Neither. Hell is an infinite hallway with every door closing as you reach for it. The sound of the closing door whispers, “Have to be quicker than that.”

You…you pray only when it benefits you. You were always consistently inconsistent.

Look…look at you. Eyes wide. Lips parted. You’re wondering if this is fiction or a confession. Do you feel the toll of it yet? The guilt of everything YOU did wrong and blamed on me? Don’t worry. I’m not here to take anything from you because, to be quite frank, you gave it all away ages ago.

I just like watching the moment you realize. When your pulse picks up. When you stop reading this as a story and start wondering if I’m actually behind you.

Go on.

Check.

…

Still with me? Good. Because I’m not finished. You probably thought you did enough to reverse all the bad things you’ve done. No no no. I’ll never leave you, silly.

I am every unfinished thought. I am that weird taste in your mouth after you say something unforgivable. And I’m always, always pleased to see you. Tell me:

What’s my name?

Say it.

No?

Then say yours. It’s the same thing. Go pray. Don’t worry. We’ll meet again. Just don’t forget your manners. A little sympathy goes a long way. And taste. Always taste the poison after you speak it.

Now go on.

Close the post.

See how long you can go before you hear me whisper:

“Pleased to meet you.”",1,1752300067.0,flashfiction,0,1.0,False

Chapter 3: Shelter in the Storm

Jeff didn't sleep that night.

After pulling the girl from the wreckage and vanishing before anyone could ask questions, he'd wandered aimlessly until the adrenaline wore off. Now, beneath the familiar hum of fluorescent lights in the tunnel corridor he called home, he sat cross-legged on a scrap of cardboard, the metallic taste of blood and memory thick in his mouth.

His hands wouldn't stop shaking.

He told himself it was the comedown. He hadn't used much—just enough to keep the ghosts at bay—but this wasn't the same tremble. This was old muscle memory. The kind that crept in after combat, after carnage, after saving someone you weren't supposed to care about.

He rubbed his palms together, trying to erase the sensation of warm blood soaking through denim. It didn't work.

For the first time in a long while, the corpsman in him had woken up.

""Stupid,"" he muttered. ""Stupid to get involved.""

But he knew better. He hadn't had a choice. Not when he saw the wreckage. Not when he heard the shallow rasp of her breath, the blood matting her hair. His body had moved before his mind could protest.

And that scared the hell out of him.

He leaned his head back against the concrete and closed his eyes.

He hadn't planned to move. Hadn't wanted to care. But something in the way the wreckage folded,
the blood on her face, the silence after the crash—

It felt familiar. Too familiar.

And maybe some part of him—the part that still remembered screaming into static after the blast—
couldn't let someone else die on his watch.

12 Years Earlier – Ramadi Iraq

0700 hours

Heat index: 122°

The air tastes like gun oil and yesterday's blood.

Jeff crouches behind a sandbag wall, radio hissing in his ear. Martinez is laughing over the net, making dumb jokes about chow. Cho is humming off-key beside him, chewing sunflower seeds. Bishop's head is down, scribbling something in a pocket Bible like he always does before a mission.

Jeff should be in that vehicle.

But the comms kit went dead, and he got flagged to swap it out at the last minute. He gave Martinez a thumbs-up before they rolled out, just as a black cat darted between the MRAP's wheels.

Cho laughed. ""That's bad luck, Doc.

Jeff smirked. ""Only if you're superstitious.""

Ten minutes later, the earth splits open.

A flash. A crack. A roar.

Then silence.

The kind of silence that doesn't mean peace—but aftermath.

Jeff's body hits the dirt instinctively, heart pounding, sand in his teeth. When he stumbles up, all that's left of the MRAP is twisted metal and fire. Tires peeled back like banana skins. Blood on the asphalt. Gear scattered like bones.

He runs.

They don't train you for what to do when it's your brothers.

Martinez is first—pinned under the axle, one leg missing below the knee, the other crushed beyond recognition. He's conscious. Screaming. Blood everywhere.

Cho is slumped in the gunner's hatch, eyes open, chest caved in. Still warm. Gone.

Bishop is crawling, one arm mangled, the other clutching at Jeff's leg. ""Help him, Doc. Please...""

Jeff freezes. His hands twitch toward Martinez, then Bishop. Martinez again.

Martinez meets his eyes. ""Don't be a fucking idiot,"" he growls. ""You got one chance. Save Bishop.""

Jeff's jaw clenches. ""Shut up.""

""Go,"" Martinez chokes. ""Tell my mom I didn't suffer.""

There's no good answer.

Jeff drags Bishop away from the wreck as mortars whistle overhead. Fire chases them for twenty feet. The heat burns the hair off Jeff's arms. Bishop screams. Then goes quiet.

They make it to cover. Jeff drops to his knees, covered in someone else's blood.

The rest is a blur—radio calls, screaming, static, waiting for the MEDEVAC that's fifteen minutes too late.

Later – Field Aid Station

Three bags.

Black. Labeled.

CHO, LANCE CPL.

MARTINEZ, PFC.

BISHOP, CPL.

Jeff stares at the sharpie marks on the plastic. Doesn't blink. Doesn't breathe.

The chaplain approaches. ""Corpsman Moreno. Can I—""

Jeff turns and walks out.

Three Days Later – Company HQ

Jeff sits in a folding chair in front of the CO's desk, sleeves rolled, boots still dusted with ash. His hands are bandaged. His eyes dead.

The CO says something about valor. About how they'll put him in for a Navy Cross.

""You did your duty, son. You made the hard call.""

Jeff doesn't respond. The words echo like they're coming through a tunnel.

Then First Sergeant Riley walks in.

He's pissed. ""We lost good men because they got lazy on route clearance. Didn't listen to my warnings.""

The CO snorts. ""Can't fix stupid. Martinez always was the reckless one.""

Jeff looks up.

""What did you say?""

""Look, Doc, I know you're grieving, but let's not rewrite history. Martinez took unnecessary risks. His luck ran out.""

Jeff is already standing.

One step.

The first punch lands square—straight nose break. CO goes down hard.

The First Sergeant steps in, yelling, reaching for Jeff's shoulder.

Second punch—ribs crack.

Then boots. Shouts. MPs pulling him off the two men he once would've followed into hell.

Someone yells, ""Stand down!""

Jeff lets them cuff him.

His only words: ""They were better men than you'll ever be.""

Brig – 0300 hours

Concrete walls. One blanket. A buzzing fluorescent bulb.

The JAG officer tells him the charges are clear. Assault. Dereliction. Conduct unbecoming.

They'll keep it quiet. Expedite the dishonorable discharge. No benefits. No appeal.

""You understand what this means, Corpsman?""

Jeff nods.

Then: ""Did they bury them right?""

The officer pauses. ""Yes. Military honors.""

Jeff closes his eyes. That's all that matters.

-------Present Day – Las Vegas

Jeff shook himself from the memory and crawled toward the tunnel exit as the sun rose above the Strip. His boots crunched over broken glass and cigarette butts. He passed a man curled beneath a sun-bleached tarp, face hidden, backpack strapped to his chest.

Rule one: never let your bag out of reach.

He made his way toward The Courtyard—Las Vegas's largest homeless resource hub off Foremaster Lane. The line for intake snaked around the chain-link fencing. Half the people there weren't new. They'd been turned away before.

No ID. No bed space. Too drunk. Too combative. Too something.

Jeff blended into the line like a ghost slipping into formation.

They offered cold water and hygiene kits. Jeff took both without speaking. He overheard one man explaining how his ID got stolen the night before.

""Can't get a job, can't get housing, can't even get a sandwich,"" he said.

Another muttered, ""Shade Tree won't take you unless you're a woman, and HELP's full again.""

Jeff kept his eyes forward.

A volunteer handed him a clipboard. Paperwork. Always paperwork. Last four of his social, emergency contact, whether he had thoughts of harming himself. He left that box blank.

As he sat on the curb outside waiting to be processed, a familiar figure walked by—older, tall, with a slow gait that said he'd seen hard years. The man didn't look directly at him, but something in the nod—tight and respectful—made Jeff's skin crawl.

Had he seen him before?

The guy didn't stop. Just disappeared down the sidewalk.

Jeff folded the intake form and tucked it into his boot. Just in case.

He wasn't sure what he wanted more: a bed, or a way out of the city.

But she—whoever she was—kept flashing across his mind. Her eyes. Her blood. The moment her fingers brushed his wrist before she blacked out.

He needed sleep.

But more than that, he needed distance.

From her. From memory. From the part of him that had cared.

He hated that it still existed.

Chapter 4: The Ripple Effect

Katie sat at her desk, still in a hospital-issued hoodie and sweatpants, staring at a blank Google search bar.

""Unknown Las Vegas crash hero,"" she typed.

Results were useless. News reports mentioned the crash, showed photos of the wreckage, even posted clips from local stations interviewing hospital staff. But no name. No face. Just the faint mention of a mystery man who vanished before they arrived.

Katie leaned back and rubbed her temples. It wasn't just about gratitude anymore. It was curiosity. Obsession, maybe. He didn't look like a paramedic. He looked like a ghost who'd stepped into the world just long enough to pull her out.

And then vanished.

Her followers had noticed the shift. The usual glossy shots and polished captions were gone. In their place were stripped-down posts—her hospital bracelet, a shot of the desert sky from her recovery room, a caption that simply read:

""Still here. Thanks to a stranger.""

The engagement exploded. DMs flooded in. Some offered theories, others shared stories of being saved by people who never stuck around.

But none gave her what she wanted: a name.

Katie closed the laptop and looked out the window. Vegas shimmered in the distance, neon and noise. She should have felt relief.

But all she could think about was him.

She thought of her brother.
Years ago, he'd overdosed in a campus bathroom. People were there, but no one called for help. They we
He died alone.
Maybe that's why this mattered more than it should've. Because someone had stepped in.

What kind of man saves a life and disappears?

What kind of pain does someone have to be carrying to live like that?

————-

Katie closed the laptop and looked out the window of her apartment. Vegas shimmered in the distance, neon and noise. She should have felt relief. But all she could think about was him—what kind of man saves a life and disappears? What kind of pain did someone have to be carrying to live like that?

She pulled up Google and started a search: ""Las Vegas Good Samaritan car crash March."" Nothing useful. She scoured Reddit forums, then a local news group. She even messaged a paramedic friend, but came up empty.

Still, she wasn't the type to stop at empty.

The next morning, she took a rideshare Fremont Street and began asking around. Not like a journalist, not like an influencer—like a woman on a mission. She hit the alley where they'd found her, hoping for something—anything. Most shrugged her off, but one woman at a corner food stand said she remembered seeing a man nearby.

""Dirty backpack, walked like he was carrying ghosts,"" the woman said. ""Didn't look right in the head, but he had kind eyes. Like the kind of guy who's seen too much to be mean anymore.""

Katie thanked her and moved on, heart pounding. There was something electric about chasing a story that actually mattered.

Late in the afternoon, she met Manny.

He was sitting outside a shelter, sipping black coffee from a Styrofoam cup. Older, wiry, sunburnt. He wore a veteran ball cap and had eyes that were too clear to lie.

""You're looking for someone,"" he said without prompting.

Katie hesitated. ""How did you know?""

""'Cause nobody walks around this part of town dressed like you unless they lost something—or someone.""

""I think he saved me,"" she said. ""He's a vet. Corpsman, maybe. I just want to say thank you.""

Manny studied her a long time. ""You sure about that?""

""What do you mean?""

""Some people don't want to be found. Especially ones like him.""

Katie nodded. ""I know. But I have to try.""

Manny leaned back and looked up at the sky. ""Alright. I'll tell you where to look. But if you find him, don't go expecting gratitude. Man's carrying a world of pain. Might not have room for anything else.""

Katie smiled, touched by his honesty. ""I'm not doing this for me.""

Manny chuckled. ""Then maybe you're the right kind of stubborn.""

She took his directions and walked off with a mix of nerves and certainty. Somewhere beneath the city, a broken man had chosen—against every instinct—to save her life.

And Katie? She wasn't going to let that go unanswered.",1,1752299934.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

**I'm writing this post to see your opinion ond how well I'm doing given the body composition below, and if you have any tips on:**   
**(1) Excercise improvement? (2) Diet improvement? (3) Anything else (sleep, habit)?**

Height 160 cm (5'2), weight 64-65 kg (141-143 lbs). Non-ambitious gym-goer (1-3x a week, 30 mins - 1 hr of random gym exercise, hiking/jogging on treadmill for 10-15 mins). I naturally have bigger thighs and wider hips (pear body). 

Apart from losing overall body fat, I want to make my thighs smaller. I notice when I do lower body exercise, my trousers feel tighter, so I try to limit it and do more upper body exercises.

Daily calorie intake +/- 1500-1700 kcal, 2x meal lunch and dinner, Asian/oriental diet (mostly stir fried veggies, rice, tofu, egg, chicken). I don't consume protein shakes/other meal/vitamin supplements. I don't eat much meat because it's expensive.

I sleep +/- 6-7 hours a day. I drink 1 glass of black coffee with ice no sugar no milk every morning. Drink alcohol socially (1-2x a month, usually beer). Non-smoker.



Today I did a body composition test with the result:   


Body Age: 26.0

BodyFat: 34.9%

Weight: 64.60kg **(High)**

BMI: 25.6 **(High)**

Body Water(%): 47.0% (Standard)

Skeletal Muscle(%): 39.9% (Standard)

Bone(%): 4.0% (Excellent)

inorganic Salt: 2.6kg (Standard)

Protein(%): 14.1% **(Low)** 

Muscle(%): 61.1% **(Low)** 

Visceral Fat Index: 6.0 (Standard)

Subcutaneous Fat: 20.8kg **(High)**

Lean body mass: 42.1kg (Standard)

Body Age: 26 

Somatotype: Obesity

BMR: 1460 kcal (Excellent)

  
The body composition metric recommends weight management as follows: 

Standard weight: 54.9kg

Weight control: -9.7kg --> I should lose this much

Fat control: -9.9kg --> I should reduce fat this much

Muscle control: +0.2kg --> I should gain muscle this much

We have lived in this apartment for 4 years and was really content with our small dwelling.

Last year, we took in a friend (22 M) who had been kicked out of his parents house, and though we didn't have the space, offered him a place to sleep until he could sort out his life.
The first night he's there, he offered to do small chores for us, like doing the dishes after dinner, and vacuuming. But after a while, he'd offer to clean the bathroom, andmake mine and my partners bed. I didn't really know what to do, so I just let him do it.
After a while of him cleaning up for my partner and I, I told him he is allowed to clean anything in our apartment if he wants to, but he cannot touch the inside of our closets, and my partners desk and bedside table, as I knew she was very particular about her stuff, and he agreed.

One night, we left him alone in our apartment as we were going out to see a movie with group of friends, and so was going to be gone for several hours, when we came back, he had fully cleaned and rearranged our apartment bedroom. Moving my partners bedside table to the other side of the room, putting our small coffee table ontop of our closet, the list goes on. And he looks at us with a grin asking if we liked it. I had to hold my partner back from exploding, and just told him it looked great.

After another week or so, he blows up. I chalked it up to him being stressed from sharing a small apartment with 2 other people, but he blew up and got angry. He complained about the dishes, he called my partner lazy and dirty, so since I didn't like how he spoke to her, I got him to leave. He had a bit of a rage fit outside our front door, but we told him he was allowed to come back in once he had calmed down, but he simply walked off and never came back.

I want to add, we never expected him or wanted him to keep our apartment tidy. He would tell him several times, do not feel obligated to clean, you are free to leave the apartment and just go out whenever you like, but he didn't.

She went silent before our first real hangout and now moves at glacier pace. How can I make our coffee catchup not awkward?","*Ages & background*

I’m 25M, researcher, never dated (I clam up around romance). Joined Bumble BFF six months ago for platonic friends. Dozens of matches faded until I met a 26F healthcare worker who cares for her disabled mum and so attached to her cat.

We chatted mostly at night and it was just so natural and left me at ease before bedtime. We talked about work stories, family, cat memes, inside jokes (lots of em). Our offices are a block apart, so we grabbed lunch three times (90-120 min each). After she randomly mentioned her favourite chocolate, I brought her a bar on the 3rd time we met. She blushed and said no one remembers details like that. No romance talk, just an unexpected spark for me.

After 5 months of talking everyday and meeting for a couple of lunches, we finally planned a Sunday hangout. The night before, she vanished. No cancel, no reply. I sent five texts every day after she disappeared, called once and even DM’d two of her IG friends (unsent later but damage done and I told her) and asked a local cop what people do when someone disappears, but didn’t tell her (anxiety).

She called the same day I asked that cop and said that a friend ‘crisis’ blew up and she’d explain later. She never did. For weeks she only watched my stories and my birthday passed silently.

After dreaming about her and seeing her nickname on a licence plate (corny but true), I sent a long message and admitted I cared, apologised for panicking and said I’d still like to catch up if she felt comfortable. I confessed that I like her and that I’d want to take her out. And I said we’d take our enough time getting to know each other first as friends and she agreed. She also said that she appreciate the honesty and that it must have been hard to write. She also said that the whole thing felt extreme and she needed ‘space’.

I replied and said that I genuinely enjoy her company and suggested a quick coffee. She wrote “Okay sure.” I offered two times. Four days later she picked a weekend coffee. Since then two more days of silence (today).

Healthcare is stressful and she also goes home to caretaking duties. I dunno if emotional extras made her feel heavy. I just leave town for the entire summer in 2 weeks and this coffee could be our last shot until September.

“You should know you’re a slime.” That’s what I remember my brother saying. “You should know that you’re just a slime, on the inside too. You’re who I know you are.” My brother usually got his lunch made by mother, when I grew up, she wouldn’t care as much about me in that regard. She told me she didn’t have time. Because she had to make lunch for my brother, because he couldn’t do that. My brother was an adult now. He went to university in another big town. He made his cooking alone, without my mother’s help. I knew that because I heard from his friends that he was a good cook. I never got invited to his outings. When I was around his age, and made lunch myself, I didn’t exactly know what I was doing, yet no one exactly taught me how to. I was on social welfare now, I couldn’t imagine finishing school – let alone university. My breakfast today was coffee and cup noodles, and baked cheese. I didn’t know how to bake, so I pan fried it. It tasted greasy, fried in Olive oil. I remember my brother saying what he said when we were alone and I told him, that my skin looked shiny in the sunlight, when I stood in the bathroom window’s light. I had believed that I was like him, with bones and human organs. But he said, he knew that I was just a slime. I don’t know why or how, he was younger than me too. So, I took his advice and stopped thinking I had bones and human organs. The other day my mother asked me why I slouched, that it would be bad for my back and bones. I told her: “Slouching? How can I slouch – and I don’t even have bones?” She looked at me like I was silly. “We went to you to the hospital as a child before, for check-ups. Of course you have bones. You have organs. Did you eat today?” I hadn’t eaten in almost 3 days because I thought I didn’t have organs, but it seems she didn’t notice that. Probably. She gave me that same look again. “Who told you?” I told her my brother did. She scoffed then looked sad, like a victim. “I don’t think he would do that. Maybe you just imagined it?” he spoke it soft; it made me anxious for some reason. When I was in my room that evening and no one was home at all, I searched for the check-ups and saw indeed: My mother had been right. When I asked my brother why he had lied to me, he said: “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Nobody had explained to me anything ever, I had realised. I had dreamt of those memories. I knew that at least for certain, because I woke up choked up and with a tear in my eye. Making breakfast would be dreadful. Fin.",1,1752299618.0,write,0,1.0,False

1lxsukt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1lxsukt/what_is_the_best_portable_carpet_cleaner/,What is the best portable carpet cleaner?,"After dealing with countless pet accidents and spills over the years, I've tested several portable carpet cleaners, and I want to share my experience to help others make an informed decision.

I've found that the Bissell SpotClean Pro consistently outperforms other portable carpet cleaners in terms of suction power and stain removal. What really sets it apart is its ability to deep clean without soaking the carpet - a common issue with cheaper models.

The best thing about portable carpet cleaners is their convenience. Unlike full-size cleaners, you can easily store them and quickly pull them out when needed. I keep mine in the laundry room, ready for those inevitable coffee spills or when my dog decides the carpet is a better option than going outside.

I recently discovered some great deals on various portable carpet cleaner models here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Carpet-Cleaner

Key features to look for in a portable carpet cleaner:
- Strong suction power
- Separate clean/dirty water tanks
- Compact design
- Lightweight (under 15 pounds)
- Long power cord (at least 15 feet)
- Useful attachments

One thing I learned the hard way - cheaper models often leave carpets too wet, which can lead to mold growth. Professional-grade portable cleaners extract more water, allowing carpets to dry faster.

For tough stains, I've found that pre-treating the area and letting the cleaning solution sit for about 5 minutes before using the machine makes a huge difference. Also, making multiple passes helps extract more dirt and water.

Maintenance is crucial too. After each use, I clean the tanks and brushes thoroughly. This prevents any funky smells and extends the machine's life. The hoses should be flushed with clean water to prevent product buildup.

If you're in the market for a portable carpet cleaner, check out the current prices and deals here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Carpet-Cleaner. I've noticed prices can vary significantly throughout the year, so it's worth monitoring.

I particularly recommend getting a model with a long hose for cleaning stairs and car interiors. The extra reach makes these tasks much easier. Also, look for machines with specialized attachments for upholstery and tough stains.

From my experience, spending a bit more upfront on a quality portable carpet cleaner saves money in the long run. Better machines clean more effectively, last longer, and can help avoid costly professional cleaning services.

Remember to always test the cleaning solution on a small, hidden area first to ensure it won't damage your carpet. And never let stains sit - the sooner you tackle them, the better your chances of complete removal.",1,1752298994.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I’m an engineer and a huge coffee nerd who loves designing and tinkering with gear. Lately, I’ve been exploring ideas for making custom coffee accessories (possibly 3D printed) and wanted to hear directly from fellow coffee lovers before I start prototyping anything.

It could be something that solves an annoying problem, makes prep or cleanup easier, or just something fun and aesthetic you'd love to have on your coffee bar.

I’m especially interested in ideas for espresso setups, but all brewing methods are welcome!

Only thing that I am having difficulty with is the interaction with video playback. I noticed that there is stutter in youtube or interaction with the desktop environment. 

Prox Mox is installed on Dell Precision 3431, 32gb memory 2666ghz, 512gb nvme2 (primary) and 512gb secondary ssd drive for storage. VM that I installed is XFS, basic Zorin Linux distro for testing. Running at the moment 2.5GB four port NIC for prox mox.  

  
Onboard video for my Precision

00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation CoffeeLake-S GT2 \[UHD Graphics 630\] (rev 02) (prog-if 00 \[VGA controller\])

Tested with onboard GPU pass through to pci, or just using default video. Tested with noVnc and Spice same behavior. Increased my Linux OS to 32gb of memory running at 8 cores. Pretty much the same.  
Verified that my guest VM is utilizing the hardware within the linux os. 

Been watching difference videos, google searching and within reddit community as well. 

I don't plan on running games, or watching intense videos at 4k. But it would be nice to have a fluid experience vs. choppy. If anything probably will have Linxus and Windows 11 running when needed. Ultimately OPNsense will be running 24/7 so no need for graphics there.

Any suggestions will be helpful as I keep testing and plugging away.

CHAPTER 1: Nathen

You would think I’d have outgrown my habit of storming into places like I own them, but no, life has a funny way of making you revert to old habits. That’s exactly what I did as I slammed through the front door, rainwater dripping off my soaked clothes and leaving a trail of wet footprints behind me. The storm outside had been bad enough to make me contemplate curling up in a ditch rather than dealing with this, but somehow, I’d thought being inside would be better. 

I was wrong. 

The sight of him hit me like a slap to the face. There he was. The same smug, entitled jerk I thought I had left behind in high school, now lounging on my couch—no, scratch that, his couch. His stupidly long legs were stretched out, his feet propped up on the coffee table like he didn’t have a care in the world. And the audacity of it? He was sipping a steaming mug of something while I stood there looking like a drowned rat. 

“Seriously?!” I snapped, throwing my drenched bag onto the floor. A satisfying splat echoed in the room. “You were supposed to pick me up!” 

My voice bounced off the walls, but he didn’t even flinch. Instead, he calmly turned his head, the corners of his mouth twitching upward in a smirk that made my blood boil. 

“Oh,” he said, his tone so casual I wanted to throw something. “You’re here.” 

I stared at him, mouth hanging open. “You’re here?” I parroted, my voice climbing an octave. “I was standing in the rain for an hour, waiting for you! You said you would come get me!” 

He set his mug down with the kind of exaggerated slowness that only someone with a death wish would dare. “I didn’t say when I would come get you,” he replied, stretching his arms behind his head like this was the most logical excuse in the world. 

If steam could physically pour out of someone’s ears, I would have looked like a malfunctioning cartoon character. My hands clenched into fists as I glared at him, my mind racing with every colorful insult I could throw his way. The nerve of him! But then again, why was I even surprised? He was the same guy who used to knock my books out of my hands in the hallway, the same guy who spread that rumor about me in sophomore year. And now he was here, in my house—okay, technically his dad’s house, which made it his house, but that wasn’t the point. 

“You’re unbelievable,” I muttered, shaking my head as I kicked off my soaked shoes, sending water droplets flying. 

“You’re welcome,” he said, leaning forward to grab the remote. 

“For what?” I hissed, still fuming. 

“For not leaving you out there all night,” he replied, flashing me a grin that made me want to launch the nearest decorative pillow at his head. “Could’ve been worse, you know. Could’ve locked the door.” 

I let out a disbelieving laugh, the kind that comes out when you’re so angry you can’t even find words. “Wow. Thanks, Nathan. You’re a real hero,” I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm. 

He chuckled, the sound low and infuriatingly relaxed. “Glad you noticed.” 

I wanted to scream but instead, I stalked past him, heading toward the stairs to my room. My clothes were clinging to me, and the cold was finally sinking into my bones, but I wasn’t about to let him see me shiver. Not after this. 

“Oh, and Mia?” he called after me, his voice taking on that irritatingly teasing tone he used to use when he was about to say something that would ruin my day. 

“What?” I snapped, whirling around to glare at him. 

“You’ve got a little something—” He pointed to his face, mimicking a smear across his cheek. “Right there.” 

I swiped at my face, mortified to find a streak of mascara running down my cheek. Of course, I looked like a raccoon. Of course, he noticed. And of course, he had to point it out. 

I didn’t dignify him with a response. Instead, I turned back around and marched up the stairs, my wet clothes making an embarrassing squelching sound with every step. Once I reached my room, I slammed the door shut behind me and leaned against it, closing my eyes and taking a deep breath. 

This was going to be a nightmare. 

I hadn’t even been here for up to a week, and he was already driving me insane. I had known moving in with my mom and her new husband would be an adjustment, but no one had warned me that adjustment would come with Nathan. Nathan, who apparently now had the title of “stepbrother.” Nathan, who clearly thought that title gave him free rein to make my life miserable all over again. 

I peeled off my wet clothes, tossing them into a heap on the floor before grabbing a towel and wrapping it around myself. As I stood there, shivering and trying to process the disaster that was my life, one thought kept running through my mind: 

How the hell was I supposed to survive living under the same roof as him?

CHAPTER 2: Justice

The wet clothes clinging to me were the first thing that needed to go. I peeled off my drenched hoodie, grimacing as it stuck to my skin before landing on the floor with a splop. My shirt underneath didn’t fare much better—it was cold, clammy, and completely see-through.  

My jeans were the worst. They clung to my legs like they had something to prove, making me twist and tug like a fish caught in a net. When I finally got them off, I kicked them toward the growing pile of wet clothes. My socks followed, soggy and gross, leaving me standing in nothing but my underwear. I shivered, rubbing my arms for warmth as I took a towel and made my way to the bathroom. 

The bathroom was tiny but cozy. It had one of those clawfoot tubs that looked charming but took forever to fill, a mirror that always fogged up no matter what, and a radiator that only worked when it felt like it. I reached out to twist the faucet, letting the water run until steam started to rise. 

I rummaged through the cabinet for my favorite lavender-scented bubble bath. The rain might’ve turned me into a miserable puddle of frustration, but lavender always had a way of making things feel less awful. I poured a generous amount into the tub, watching as the water foamed and turned cloudy. 

Once the tub was full, I stepped in cautiously, the hot water stinging my frozen toes at first. But as I sank in deeper, the warmth wrapped around me like a hug I didn’t know I needed. I let out a long sigh, closing my eyes for a moment. 

The tension in my muscles began to melt away as I leaned back, letting my hair soak in the water. I ran my fingers through it, untangling the knots left behind by the rain. The smell of lavender filled the small space, calming me in a way nothing else had that day. 

As I scrubbed the day off my skin, my mind wandered back to him. 

Nathan.

But it's worthwhile to mention I do like to play and learn guitar.
Etc. etc . Lol

* I absolutely Love reading and watching Horror movies.. I gravitate towards slashers and psychological thriller. Suspense is just oxygen to me lol.

Books yes . Dogs or cats ?  Dogs here 

Cooking .. hell yes 🤤 
I don't play much games nowadays. I love black coffee/ Americano
I do like racing games and some fighting games. Mostly fallout and Mortal Kombat Mobile.
Mental health advocate/ empathetic 
Physical fitness .  So so

Excruciating pain when standing or walking but no other time?,"My sciatica that started suddenly on the morning of July 4, is like no other back pain I've ever had.  I can bend over and flex my back, touch my toes, roll into and out of bed and get up and down from sitting - no pain in doing any of this.  There is only a vague feeling of something not right in my lower back, as long as I am sitting or lying down, or standing for no more than one minute.

But if I stand for more than a minute, the pain from my lower back, down the side and front of my right leg to my shin builds, and by the second or third minute, it is excruciating and I have to find some way to sit back down, or at least support my weight with my arms on a ledge or table.   The maximum distance I can walk before the pain is too bad is 300 yards - less if it is downhill.

Preparing meals is very difficult without repeated breaks sitting on a stool until pain subsides.  Just making coffee takes 45 minutes.

I also have weakness in my right quad and some numbness around my knee.

The Dr. office managed to get me in on July 8, where a nurse practitioner gave me 7 day prescription for prednisone, and then I had to request a muscle relaxant so she prescribed  cyclobenzaprine.  She also gave me a referral for physical therapy.   I discontinued the prednisone after just 2 days when I read about all the interactions even to NSAID's - and studies indicating that it does nothing for pain.   I'm probably gonig to discontinue the cyclobenzaprine becasue it isn't doing any good - only makes me feel light headed and intoxicated in an unpleasant way.

I'll make an appointment for the physical therapy next week.

I presume that I need to get more assertive and ask for a referral to a specialist which I don't have to wait months for an appointment.   What would you-all recommend?",1,1752296112.0,Sciatica,1,1.0,False

I (19F) had this friend throughout most of high school, we didn’t have a big fall out at all just slowly life got busy and I moved away for a period of time and we ended up never hanging out/catching up so we fell off about a year ago. 

Well recently she (19F) announced she’s pregnant, shortly after she reached out to me to ask if I would take her photos (maternity & newborn photos). I agreed and even gave her a MAJOR discount because she mentioned their financial struggles. 

Well our last maternity photoshoot is in a week, and she has a planned C-section so I know I’ll be doing the newborn photos in just over a month (she has me booked in a month from now to do them)… 

Would it be weird to give her a little “birth/postpartum” gift & leave a note in the basket simply stating: 

— hey girl I’m hear if you need anything else (a warm meal, help cleaning the house type or thing something new moms actually need/want) 
— I’d love to grab a coffee and catch up sometime once you and the little one have settled in 
— it was great to see you again and have a special job of documenting (I’m a photographer) your pregnancy journey! 

But would this be a bad/odd way and time to rekindle a friendship ??

1lxrync,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lxrync/i_dont_like_my_brothers_girlfriend_and_i_dont/,I don’t like my brothers girlfriend and I don’t know if I am in the wrong here or not for feeling this way,"I (20f) am having trouble accepting my brothers (24M) girlfriend (22f) She grew up and lives in the same town as us so she’s not far just for context. We both live at home. Sorry that this is a very long post, I just need to explain in depth why I feel this way. 

One of the first things that rubbed me the wrong way was before I had ever even spoken to her in depth my brother had got me a shirt that said “im annoying” for my “joke” birthday gift (a thing our family does before the real gift), and when he had told her about the shirt on the phone while he had her on speaker, she responded saying, “that’s so perfect for her it fits her personality perfectly” as if we’re familiars, I felt that was rude. 

one of the first times she came over to our house she was telling my mom how she felt her kitchen should be arranged. She talked down to my brother in front of my parents, and they couldn’t believe how she was demanding things from him like a servant (which she has since stopped since he had a conversation with her about it). 

Another time she demanded that I watch our cats while my parents go out of town so that she can stay the week, but I already had plans & my brother had promised my mom 3 weeks before she invited herself over that he would watch our cats, she called me a brat and curse words, when I offered half the week and changed my plans. Another thing anytime my brother is asked to feed the animals or help with anything when she’s here he acts like a complete jerk and she tells him we’re “using him”, for context my mom just bought him a 10,000 car after he crashed his, he doesn’t pay rent, and she asks for help with small around the house things. He says she was raised very spoiled and was never asked for anything so to her It’s unacceptable that he’s asked to do things by people that aren’t her. 

I borrowed a couple cotton round flats from my brother that have salicylic acid on them because we both use the same one, he borrowed it from me countless times and I just thought it was something we share, but he ended up getting mad about it suddenly and told me to stop using it and I said okay and I didn’t use it again. Then a few days later I was looking for a soap that my best friend got custom-made for me in Colorado for my birthday that was in a box under my side of the sink, I found it in the shower used. I asked my brother and they had gone under my sink and opened/ used it, he said sorry but she overheard and yelled “don’t apologize to her she used your acne pads.” I felt like that was totally rude for her to jump into our conversation and team up against me. He later clarified to her that he had used mine before as well, and she said that it didn’t matter. 

My dad wakes up at 5 AM for work every day and she’ll come over and sometimes overstay her welcome being here sometimes a week and be loud until 12 in the morning laughing on the top of her lungs. I also had to tell my brother to say something because she would leave her products/items scattered all over the counter to where I couldn’t even get ready for bed, she put her personal items on of my makeup container (my only item on the sink in the corner), and she apparently responded by calling me bossy. 

She moved my mom’s stuff and took an entire large basket on our pantry rack for her coffee/ snacks and demands that no one is allowed to touch it. Meanwhile, my mom pays for all her groceries when she’s here. I would never take space in someone’s home when I don’t live there, who does that? 

My brother invited her to my intimate birthday event without asking and I told him to uninvite her because it was just him and my cousin and I felt it was rude. He just invited her to my parents anniversary surprise party that I was throwing that I spent all the money for, without asking, knowing my mom isn’t super fond of her. He automatically invites her onto her trips without talking to anyone else in the family even when he’s not the one paying. I don’t even go if I know she’s going so I haven’t been on the past 2 family weekend trips.  Nobody else in my family will say anything because they feel extremely uncomfortable. The only time it was ever called out was on my birthday. 

They have been dating one year and she will often get angry if he says he wants to wait to get married by giving him the silent treatment. She’s pressuring him to marry her frequently. He had to get her a promise ring, and it still has not made her chill. This person constantly being around and me feeling like I can’t even enjoy time with my family anymore sucks, my home doesn’t feel like a safe space anymore. I feel very uncomfortable around her. I asked my brother to go on a little road trip a couple towns over for the day just us and he told me only if he can invite her.

And I want to preface this by saying it's going to be very graphic and detailed of what I went through. So if that might be a trigger, I would not continue to read. But I'm coming here to feel less alone and to seek others who might have gone through something similar.   
  
\**I do also want to say I am not suicidal, and I am currently seeing a psychiatrist and therapist for help navigating through my trauma and grief.*\*  
  
It has now been a month since my dad has passed and it genuinely hurts going day by day without him. He was my best friend, my protector, my other half. I never imagined a life where it would be without him. I would get up in the middle of the night sometimes to get a snack and he'd already be there and we'd just laugh and have late night talks while everyone else was asleep. We'd get up in the morning and made coffee together, and sat out on the deck while it was cool outside. He got me into Marvel movies, and I watched them with him all the time. He was a big fan and read the comics growing up so his face lit up when he got to tell me the lore on some of his favorite characters finally being brought to life from his childhood. He was so funny and goofy, my humor solely comes from him. He was my best friend in the entire world. I used to give him a hug every single night before he went to bed. I could write a book about what a great person he was, what a great FATHER he was. I've always said I think one of his divine purposes of being here on earth was to be a great father. and he did just that. I couldn't have dreamt of a better father.   
  
All he ever did was help others. He helped take care of his father when his dad was sick, and his dad passed away, and one of the last things dad did before he got sick, was take care of his mother while she was sick. He was gone away from home so much to take care of his mom, we didn't even notice when he started to lose the weight. We thought it was because he would work all day, come home for ten minutes to pack a bag, and go over to his moms, then wake up and repeat the cycle again. We thought it might've just been from stress. We found out the worst news, and it was that he had cancer.   
  
I can't tell you the pain and trauma that had ensued since then. I had to watch my dad who was so full of life, always dancing, full of love, laughter and jokes, turn into someone I didn't know anymore. I had to watch him get so skinny, couldn't get around without a walker, he would get tired just putting on clothes. he would take a nap in between putting on his pants, and then putting on his shirt. he said it would feel like he ran a 5k. he was always sleeping. I had to watch him fall trying to get from place to place and it scared me so much. there were times I had to help him and go to another room and cry and come back and continue to help like nothing happened. there were things I had to witness that I would never wish on any human ever and I would never utter to anyone because it's something you would never fathom actually happening to someone in real life. I spent almost every other night at the hospital with him with every beep and noise jolting me into wondering what was wrong. he was throwing up constantly. everything he ate he threw it back up. I remember them giving him ativan and he would start hallucinating and seeing things that weren't there. my heart dropped. he had so many surgeries. at one point he had emergency surgery bc he was throwing up all this blood, and it was bc his tumor started bleeding and he ended up in the icu. I remember when I went in I was crying so bad. it sucked seeing him that way. why such a kind human being had to endure so much trauma. and it just hurts so much. I want to remember him but every memory just hurts. for the last year I had to witness the decline of my best friend. I just feel like we were traumatized over and over and over again just for the final result was to watch him pass away.   
  
I will never forget the smell of the bile and fluid he was constantly throwing up. then he started to not speak anymore. then all he would do is groan. and it was life shattering. he moaned and groaned when trying to move his legs, when we tried to give him the oxygen he would swat it away and it was so stressful. we had to resort to giving him morphine, and even then he was still restless moving back and forth and all I could think is why won't he calm down? it scared me so much that even morphine that was supposed to relax him made him antsy. they took him to hospice, and he grew weaker on the transport there, and he passed shortly after arriving. I just don't understand and I don't think I ever will. the only reason I even attempted to have a positive outlook the entire time was because he did. he was the sweetest person on earth and it sucks that I have to live the rest of my life without him. and to make matters worse I had to wake up to a post on Facebook from a relative saying to pray for HER because SHE had to watch her uncle suffer from cancer and pass away. she didn't witness a DAMN thing. she never even fucking visited but once and it was once we practically knew it was terminal. it was his FAMILY his CHILDREN his WIFE who watched his decline. who was there for him. who did everything we could to make sure he was comfortable and try to get him better.  
  
I just have so much anger and resentment and i'm turning into someone my dad wouldn't like. I just feel like this isn't real. like why rip the one person who means the most to me out of my life? it just doesn't make any sense. it makes me question everything. it makes me question my purpose. it makes me question what am I even doing with my life. I have to now force myself to continue to try and find peace and live my life. I know im just in the thick of it and it will most likely get better as time goes on but y'all just don't understand how much my father meant to me.   
  
but I just wanted to vent and possibly talk to someone who has been through anything remotely similar. I feel like one of the hardest things about this process is I have no one that has gone through what I have gone through.

She passed away peacefully in my grandma’s (her mom) house and I take pride in knowing I was nearby. It hurts me knowing I should’ve stayed in her room but I guess that’s how people go to lessen the pain. I posted back here in January when she entered hospice and it didn’t feel real then either.

For the majority of the time I took care of my mom. I don’t always want to admit it because my sisters did help out here and there. I took care of her medications, I knew which ones she needed to take and when and what to do if she felt pain after her regular doses. It feels so strange to not administer any meds. To look at the time and not think “okay in an hour this med is due.” 

Before hospice I would drive us an hour to the emergency room whenever she felt pain. I bought a coffee maker and dark roasts to keep myself awake during those drives. I don’t have to do that anymore. I haven’t had to in a long while but it feels wrong. I would call off of work because I was far too tired to go in. Sometimes I would still go in since bills wait for no one.

With the way my house is set up with my sisters I ended up taking my mom’s room like two years ago when my sister graduated college and moved back home and my room in the basement became hazardous. It feels wrong to be sleeping here. I never moved her stuff because I always thought she would come home and see her things. I can’t move her stuff now. I feel a bit lost now that she passed.

We were having a verbal disagreement, I noticed he was secretly video taping me so I stood up, walked towards his phone that was sitting on a coffee table a few feet from where he was sitting and I took the phone. Right after I took the phone off the coffee table, he stood up and grabbed me. He wrestled me to the couch and choked me. Then he picked me up and threw me around while I screamed for help and tried to escape him. Then he bodyslammed me on the cement and began recording me with his phone again. 

The indoor security camera in the house got the entire thing on video.
He called the police, they asked us both what happened and arrested us both. He told the cops I “hit” him with a spray bottle, but I didn’t physically hit him. I sprayed him with Simple Green when he was trying to attack me. He acknowledges that when he said “hit” he meant “hit by the spray” not physically hit. Anyway, it’s all on video. The cops were provided with only his cell phone footage of me gasping for air after he choked me but the security camera footage of the entire event was never given to the police.  We both bonded out.

A month goes by and we both receive letters from the DA that says they will not be filing charges at this time based on the evidence provided but that they have 1yr from the date of arrest to file charges later, if they chose to do so.

I have since left the relationship and moved to a different state after he assaulted me again in March. 

I want the DA to file charges against him for assaulting me- he’s a violent person. I have the video footage of the entire event that shows him assaulting me. How do I get the DA to file charges against him with the video evidence I have?  How can I protect myself while requesting the DA to file charges against him?

It's the absolute relinquish of one's self to the madness they so crave. When morality seems like nothing more than a lie you tell yourself, you become the very thing you were meant to be. 

Phillip Hayes was a young man with an aspiring future. After landing an internship at a local law firm, he worked his way up to owning his own practice, specializing in family law. From divorces and child custody battles to drafting prenuptial agreements, Phillip earned a reputation as a respectable lawyer. He had a family of his own—his wife, a son, and a daughter—and, by all outward appearances, he was living the American dream. Life, it seemed, was in his hands, and he was taking it by the horns.

He fought his way through college, studying until his brain felt like it might pour out of his skull in a fit of exhaustion before the bar exam. He was a hard worker with a stable family and a home he could call his own. But the old saying held true: If it’s too good to be true, it probably is. And now, standing in his bathroom with his hands gripping the sink, sweat dripping down his face, Phillip was starting to realize just how true that saying really was. He’d recently contracted some kind of infection, but for the life of him, he couldn’t remember where or how.

His brain pulsated to the rhythm of his heartbeat; and no matter what he took or how much sleep he got, he could not rid himself of it. Still, he tried desperately to ignore the pains, but just as soon as he thought he was in the clear, the headaches came back with a vengeance. He tightly shut his eyes to drown out the pain, but nothing seemed to work; and that fucking light above the sink was only making it worse. Its malevolence didn't end there. It cracked his skull open and reached into his brain, pulling and twisting his wires so the voices of his wife and children made it all the more unbearable.

He lingered in the bathroom, trying to shake the throbbing pain in his head away when he heard his wife call from the dining room. Her voice grounded him when he was buried in his studies. Before they were married, they were just two college students who met on the steps of Angel Falls University—a respected college that offered a wide variety of studies from law to even education. While he studied to be a lawyer, his wife was in education, studying to become a teacher. She loved molding the minds of children and having a hand in helping them find their way through life. When they met, it was like fireworks and they instantly fell in love, taking every chance they had to go out or just stay inside and enjoy a night to themselves. 

Phillip had a small apartment four blocks away from the college and walked there, while his wife —Emily— stayed on campus. If they chose to stay inside, she would knock on his door after classes with Chinese or pizza. They found a movie they wouldn't finish, and woke up in his bed the following morning. Phillip worked for his father as a legal consultant for his newspaper. His father ran a very tight, yet integral tabloid newspaper called Falls News. Due to their unbiased approach, they ruffled the feathers of politicians. His father brought him on to ensure the safety of his business.  

Phillip took pride in the work he did for his father, carrying the experience and knowledge he gained into his studies. After securing an internship at a local law firm, he earned his license and eventually started his own firm after graduation. His wife, Emily, landed a teaching job as a substitute with the promise of a full-time position in two years. Not long after, they eloped, and soon after that, Phillip took out a loan to buy the house they now called home. Their son, Adrian, was born shortly thereafter, followed by their daughter, Sylvia, two years later. Adrian and Sylvia were good kids, raised by two parents who could provide them with everything they could ever need.

Adrian, now ten, was a prodigy in sports, especially football. His family attended every game, cheering him on as he dominated the field. Sylvia, still young, was well on her way to mastering the violin. She had a gift for music, able to pick up any song and blow her parents away with her talent. Phillip often reflected on the moments when Adrian scored a touchdown or when Sylvia stunned the audience with a solo at her school concert. Those were irreplaceable moments, and just remembering them wasn't enough. He was grateful that Emily always had her phone ready to capture the moments, so he could replay them whenever he needed.

But since the headache began two days ago, their voices—once a source of comfort—had become like nails scraping across a chalkboard, and he couldn’t bear it.

He used to love hearing about their days, it was the highlight of his own. But over the past couple of days, he couldn’t stomach it anymore. The pain had become so immense that all he wanted was for them to shut up.

Even the mere thought of them was enough to squeeze his brain, until it felt like it would pour out of every orifice. He just wanted it to go away, but the harder he fought, the stronger it came back. It stomped him in the ground, doubling down on the pressure as it laughed in his face. His skull was about to burst.

Every pulse was another nail hammered into his cranium, and every time it sent shockwaves of agony, he was pushed further into the dirt. It made him dizzy and nauseous at times; often turned his vision into blurry nonsensical garbage hard to make out. His family—nothing more than globs of blur moving about the house, their voices muffled and faded. The constant misery wore him down. He couldn't take it anymore. He was flirting with the pistol he left in his bedside drawer. Maybe if he put a hole in his head, the pain would stop.

No, he couldn't do that. He couldn’t hurt them. When he tried to discipline his children, he felt a ping of guilt dwell up inside of him. He beat himself up for an entire week if he evenso raised his voice.  All he could do was fight through the pain and hope it subsided eventually.

“Phillip, you're going to be late for work!”

Emily's soft, distinct voice drifted from the dining room, seeping through the cracks in the door. Why did he have to hate that voice now? He loved it, cherished it—but this headache twisted it into something monstrous, and he feared it would shred his brain. He swallowed hard, pushing the pain down, but no matter how much he tried, the headache wouldn’t relent.

“I-I’ll be right out!” He called back. That was a mistake. The vibrations of his own voice made the headache even worse, like a tooth on the verge of exploding. If there was one thing he hated more than their voices, it was the sound of his own.

He splashed his face with water and dried himself off, trying to put the agony behind him, but it just followed. He thought water would drown the look of pain on his face, but he could see it clear as day in the mirror. Bags under his eyes desecrated his face; the color in his eyes faded due to fatigue. He could ripple over any second if it wasn't for the pain splitting his skull in two. 

Adrian and Sylvia were both eating cereal; his wife took a bite out of some toast and sipped on her coffee when he entered. Emily was the first to notice the change in his demeanor, and her normal, welcoming smile turned to concern. 

“Still not feeling well, honey?”

There was that pain again. He put a hand up to his forehead to try and silence it, but it was relentless.  

“Yeah,” he nodded as he sat down. He reached for his coffee mug. Whatever plagued him swam through his veins. Nerves on red alert, his body trembled. He could barely keep a steady hand. He grabbed the mug, but it slipped, and he was covered in scalding hot liquid. Not only did it infect his veins, taking his body by storm, but also faltered his mood. His impatience formidable, his anger unrelenting. His life was unraveling and it was all because of this fucking headache. 

When the coffee spilled over him, everything he stuffed down as deep as he could, fought back against his suffocating attempts. It spilled out in a single outburst, his hand smacking the mug and sending it to shatter against the wall. No coherent thought passed through his mind. All he could feel, think, taste was anger. The mug became the subject to his torture. He wanted something to feel the same pain and agony he felt. He didn't want to suffer alone.

“GOD DAMN IT!” He expelled the remaining rage in audible anger. 

Why was he like this? It was just a goddamn headache. He wanted everything to just stop. Please just stop. Fucking stop! It was now driving his actions and for a split second, he lost control. First came the headache, then came everyone, including himself, annoying the fuck out of him, and now he was spilling coffee all over him. He wanted to get back at everything, break it into pieces so it would be quiet.

As the last of his madness left his body, his nerves settled and he was left with the aftermath. The look of horror on the faces of his wife and children froze him to his core. He swore he would never hurt them and here he was, terrifying them. He thought what would happen if he continued on this decline. Would he lose them forever? Guilt put a hole through his heart and he felt his soul pour out. It was hard to breathe looking at them with those expressions on their faces. Please, make it stop.

Emily, bless her heart, tried to relieve the tension in the room. With a soft voice as she grabbed her children's attention, she produced some sort of cure to their momentary fear. 

“Come on, kids, go get ready for school. Your father is not feeling well.”

She knew about the headaches; it hurt her there was nothing she could do. She made multiple trips to the pharmacy, but no matter what she brought home, nothing worked. She feared he may have something worse than just an illness, and she was flirting with the possibility she might have to take him to the hospital. She also knew how much work he had on his plate. His father's tabloid was under scrutiny from certain articles released over topics considering recent murders throughout Angel Falls; Phillip pulled in overtime to help his father keep the newspaper running. He called in favors, looked up laws and was on the phone with a friend of his to ensure his father could stay afloat. All the stress, on top of his headaches, were only making matters worse, and if he did not take care of himself, Phillip could see his body taking a break with or without his consent. 

“Maybe you should stay home today. You've had this headache for two days now and you've hardly slept. Please, take care of yourself.”

Phillip looked at his two kids in silence, allowing the guilt in him to rip him to pieces. He sighed. He had to throw in the towel somewhere, but he couldn’t give up on his family. Her concerns were valid, and whether he admitted it or not, he was even scaring himself. With a nod, knowing that he could not keep going the way he was, he reluctantly, but inevitably agreed. She was right. He was banging his head against the wall trying to help his father while dealing with his own cases, and it was just adding to the pile. 

“Okay,” he breathed as he clutched his head. The pains would not stop, but he had to fend them off the best he could. He was the pillar of strength in his family. They needed him at his best—he could not afford to give them any less. “Okay okay.”

Whatever this headache was, he was sure he would get to the bottom of it. He would be back to normal if he just stayed home and took a nap. He did not need to live with the guilt of taking his stress out on his family on top of everything else; it hurt enough knowing he was already not feeling like himself. 

As his kids grabbed their empty bowls once filled with cereal and stood from the table, they walked past him half hesitantly. This was so out of character for their father—they did not know how to react. He stood with his hands on the table and his eyes looking at the floor like he had just been punished. Whatever was happening to him, he had to take care of it before it got the better of him again. 

Adrian and Sylvia piled up at the door with their backpacks as Emily kissed Phillip goodbye. Maybe that's all he needed—some sleep. He could sleep the day away, and by the time Emily and the two kids returned home, he would feel like his old self again. After they left, he took more medication and laid down. He was hit with a wave of optimism—he was going to wrestle this headache to the ground and stand victorious.

He laid awake in bed as he pleaded, prayed and wished for the pain to stop, but it only seemed to get worse. The entire world was spinning as he stared up at the ceiling. He was starting to feel drunk. Was this the end? Was this how he died? Confined to a bedroom as he suffered alone? He tossed and turned to stare at the closet as he tried to will it away, but nothing he did seemed to stop the pain. 

He thought it would never go away. That was, until he heard a faint sound. Was it a whisper? A breath? It was low and guttural, whatever it was. There was a faint vocal fry undertone. A doubled tone like two people were making the same sound simultaneously. They were haunting, invasive. They slithered into his ears and massaged his brain. The pain slowly slipped away like it was never there. For the first time in two days, he finally felt like his old self again. 

Sprawled out, his lips creased into a small smile. It was gone. The pain was really fucking gone. He thought about catching up on sleep, but those voices persisted. They insisted things. They suggested things. He couldn't make out what they said, but he knew what they compelled him to do. They offered the end to his suffering, but he had to get up. Get up. Come here. We'll take it away. We'll take it all away. 

He wanted to stay in bed. He wanted to do what they wanted. He was conflicted. Sleep evaded him the past couple days. The pain was insurmountable—undefeatable. It was the heavyweight boxing champ, and he was stuck in a bare-knuckle match. He needed a rest, but the voices jumped in. They had his back when nothing else worked; whisked him away on a cloud of comfort and serenity. He was taught not to look a gift horse in the mouth. They descended upon him with angelic wings—he could answer their beckoning calls. 

Come, Philip. Come. We'll make everything better.

Yes. They could make everything better. They could fix everything. His father's firm? They could make the accusations disappear. The phone calls and his cases? They could answer the phones and show up to court for him. He could finally be the man, the husband, the father he always wanted to be.

He sat up and swung his legs over the side of the bed. They could fix anything. Solve world hunger, find the cure to cancer, end death. Nothing was beyond their grasp. Nothing. His vision was clearer than it had ever been. He saw the colors and shapes of his surroundings gleam. The lights pouring in through the window sparkled. The air that touched his skin—serene. He felt his hairs rising and falling, tickling his arms. The sounds of the universe whistled softly. The birds chirping, the cars outside, the wind brushing past the house. He was living in paradise. 

Do you like what we have given you, Philip? Come. We have more to show you. So much more. 

The whispers were just as clear as everything else. He could make out every word; every syllable. They were all around him, echoing in his ears as they pulled him from the bed and toward the bathroom. He felt like a cartoon character, floating off the ground as the aroma of a pie cooling in a windowsill morphed into a finger, beckoning him to follow.

When he pressed his feet to the floor, the carpet crunched under him, and slid between his toes. Ecstasy swam through his veins and throughout his body. He levitated through the doorway of the bedroom, and toward the bathroom door. The whispers were stronger. There were so many, they toppled over each other. Most were impossible to make out, but the same two voices squeezed through the cracks of the closed door. They were inviting. Arms wide like a blanket to shield him from all the nightmares reality had to throw at him.

Come in. Come in. We'll keep you safe.

Philip pushed the door open slowly. A creak cut through the silence, and he saw his reflection in the mirror in front of him. He could see himself clear as day, and the closer he got, the more he could make out his face. The bags under his eyes began to crack open. Black streaks traced down his cheeks like varicose veins. The whiteness of his eyes were being swallowed by a milky black, just barely out of the reach of his irises. 

Closer. Come closer.

The voices reverberated off of one another, all repeating, calling for him. He took a step into the bathroom, his feet touching the cold tile. He never knew what cold was until he stepped into that bathroom. Each step nipped at his soles, but the warmth of his body soothed the cold’s teeth. His form in the mirror grew bigger the closer he got. He placed his fingers to his bottom eyelid and pulled it down. The black consumed all of his pupils underneath the skin, leaving no hint of the white that was once there. 

Come closer. Closer. Come closer. 

He dropped his arm and reached out to the sink, gently grabbing it and leaning into the mirror. His gaze was abnormal and detached. Every ounce of life he had now belonged to the voices. He was theirs and nothing could tear him away from their grip. They clutched his soul and told it how to feel, what to think and what to do. He was their perfect little soldier.

They were everything to him; all that he wanted and would ever want. It pissed him off that he was limited to his human body. They could do so much more if he shed his skin and came into what he was meant to be. If he could destroy the prison keeping his soul trapped, he could fulfill every wish, every demand. Yes, destroy. Destroy. Destroy.

Destroy. Destroy. Destroy. 

The voices echoed the thoughts in his head. Destroy the body so he may be free. Destroy. Destroy. Destroy. The words overcame him, sinking deep into his very core. He had to do what they said. They were all that mattered, all that would ever matter. Destroy. Destroy. Destroy. He had to obey. They saved him, so he must return the favor. He reared his head back and lunged forward, smashing his face into the mirror. The impact jolted his systems. He stumbled back, blood fell from the indention on his forehead. He broke the skin, the fractured flesh dripping with fresh, warm crimson. 

He marched to the sink and slammed his face into the mirror again. He gripped the sink tightly, keeping his feet firmly planted into the ground. Again, he violently greeted the mirror with his face. Again and again and again. Every time he broke his skin further, every time he left a stain of blood. His nose was broken and the mirror splintered from the point of impact. He wouldn't stop until the voices got what they wanted. One final time, he slammed his face into the mirror. It shattered, shrapnel cutting through his face and falling to the sink and the ground. 

He stared at his broken reflection in what was left of the mirror, blood covering his face. He was nearly unrecognizable, but he felt no pain. He felt nothing. He was empty, void of who he used to be. The voices were all that there was. Everything else could fall away, so long as the voices didn't turn their backs on him. Still, as he stared at himself, he knew this was not enough. He had to do more. They weren't satisfied—they needed more. Destroy. Destroy. Destroy. 

A single piece of glass in the shape of a long, jagged arrowhead clung to the black canvas behind the mirror. It separated, and easily pulled away when he plucked it . This was the instrument to his salvation. He would finally give himself completely to the voices. If he traced the outline of his throat with the piece of glass cutting through the palm of his hand, he could give them what they wanted. Slit it open and set himself free. 

Destroy. Destroy. Destroy.

***

After dropping off the kids, Emily sat in the parking lot, mulling over her options. She could go to work and try to distract herself. He was at home getting some much needed sleep. He would be fine when she returned later that night. On the other hand, if she was truly that worried, she should take him to the hospital. There was something seriously wrong with him. She feared he would get worse. With a deep sigh, she fished out her phone from her purse and called off from work. It was last minute; she would surely catch some slack for this, but she couldn't shake her worry.

Worry wreaked havoc on her brain as she raced over the different possibilities of what he could have. Maybe she was overreacting. It really could just be a head cold. But he was getting worse—maybe she wasn’t overreacting at all. Maybe she was under reacting. Oh God, what could he have? Cancer? The flu? Congestion? Allergies? If he came into contact with something he didn't know he was allergic to—would she have to get an epi pen?

Panic set in; she was on the verge of inconsolable. She worked herself up, filling her entire being with anxiety. What if she got home and he was dead? The headache could've been the start of something else. Her drive home from the school turned seconds into minutes; minutes into hours. She thought she'd never pull up to the driveway. When she put her car into park outside of their garage, she burst through the front door. 

“Philip?! Honey?! I'm taking you to the hospital!”

There wasn't time for subtlety. She threw her purse to the table and charged up the stairs. Her heart was in her throat, her skull an echo chamber for the beat. Philip stared at himself in the mirror. The fine point of the glass pressed against his throat. He defied God. He defied her. He defied the whole fucking universe. Destroy. Destroy. Destroy. He drew his own blood. He would give them what they wanted. They saved him—rescued him when he thought his life was on the verge of ending. 

When her voice echoed through the halls, the voices retracted in anger. Where did she come from? Who did this bitch think she is? 

She would ruin everything. 

No, no, no. This couldn't happen. She couldn't find him like this. If she found him in the state he was in—she would take them away. 

They needed him.

They needed destruction. 

Destroy. Destroy. Destroy. 

Yes—destroy. All they needed was destruction. They would find a way to make it work if he destroyed her. The world was a nasty and evil place. 

Someone would kill her eventually. 

Yes they would. Look at her. Emily was beautiful. Her long, wavy blonde hair and the red lipstick, her pearly white teeth and the perfect line of her eyeliner. She went to the gym three times a week, ate her fruits and vegetables, and measured every ounce of food she put in her body. She knew the nutritional facts on the back of everything she bought. 

Childbirth usually ruined women's bodies, but not hers. She was perfect. She smelled like coconuts and her skin was smooth to the touch. She was the ideal target for the most sadistic killers out there. A woman like that, had to be like hitting the fucking lottery. If it wasn't him, it would be them—selling her off to the highest bidder, or splitting her open like a science experiment, leaving her innards to dangle above.

It wouldn't be destruction if he was saving her—like the voices saved him. They would accept his compassion for her as a reward for taking the pain away.

At the top of the stairs, a closet sat to the left; a long hallway stretched to the right. There were four doors—two on either side. Three were bedrooms, and the furthest door on the left led to the bathroom. Across from it was the door to their bedroom. Both doors were open, but Emily’s attention was fixed on their bedroom. As she reached the top, she immediately turned right. Her feet pressed into the loose wood beneath the carpet, causing it to creak.

She was getting closer. He could hear her breaths—shallow, quick—smell the panic in them. 

Save her.

She stopped outside the bedroom, looking inside. The bed was in shambles—covers and sheets haphazardly pulled into a pile at the center. His clothes from earlier that day were tossed to the floor in a heap, and the room smelled of sweat and sickness. But he wasn’t there.

Where was he?

He turned away from the mirror, inching toward the bathroom door. He stared at the back of her head, just as he had so many times before in moments of passion.

Save her. Save her. Save her.

Don’t worry, Emily—everything will be alright. I’ll take you from this place. I’ll send you somewhere better. Somewhere peaceful, where you can run through endless gardens, soak your feet in the sea, and smile without fear. You’ll be free. They won’t hurt you. I won’t let them.

1lxrjjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FathersJourney/comments/1lxrjjb/old_words/,Old words,"*I found a folder on my computer tonight with a bunch of what I thought were journal entries.  But they’re not.  They were things that I meant to post here, only I never did.  I’m not sure why.  They’re all around the same time – not too long after Zach was home. It was before the safety of this little sub, so maybe I felt that they were too sentimental or schmaltzy for a general audience.  But hell, you’ve all learned to deal with my messy posts by now.  So I thought I’d share one of them with you.  It is schmaltzy - enough to rot your teeth - and thinking about it now, I’m sure that’s why I never posted it.  But seeing as you’ve all come to know PJ well, I'm hoping this will help you appreciate him even more.*

 \--

I have a library of books here in my study, and I use them all the time.  I’m sure it’s easier to google a quote, but I’m old-school.  I like my books.

Zach likes my books too; he would raid my shelves quite often.  He's been in here again, I know he has; he's reading a lot more now.

This morning, I was searching for my copy of Steinbeck, and so I went to Zach’s room.  We built shelves in there too. 

“Do you have my copy of Charley?”

“I think so,” Zach answered, gesturing to the wall.

I found the book, but I found something else too.  PJ’s owl; a stuffed toy he had when he was little was tucked in the corner of a high shelf.  I would notice right away that the owl was wearing a football helmet.  I remembered the helmet too – it was a souvenir trinket from some long-ago game; I think it came with French fries. 

“What is Owl doing in here?” I asked.

Zach, sitting at his desk then, rested back in his chair and offered a little shrug.  “PJ put him there,” he said, but as he said it, there was a definite hint of enchantment in his tone.  

“He gave him to you?”

“No.  He just put him there.”

I hadn’t, until now, noticed the toy on Zach’s shelf.  Seeing it there, I could feel my own smile, the kind that warms you from the inside.  I knew that I didn’t need to ask another question.

Looking back, I can still see Suzanne giving voice to Owl when PJ was little.  Oh, how he loved when she did that.  Owl was always the wise elder of all his toys.  Owl knew everything; Owl was brilliant.

Before the accident it wasn’t uncommon, when one the boys said something stupid, that the other would say, “You need to be fitted for a helmet.”  It was a joke.  But then it wasn’t funny anymore.

Zach has to wear a helmet when he's up and about, and I know it embarrasses him.  But we never really talk about it.

There, on the shelf in Zach’s room, PJ left a sweet and quiet message, a self-evident answer to the requirement.  I can think of no better illustration of what he means to say.

Writing this now, I feel rich in my pride for a boy that has never stopped amazing me.

Later, PJ came in through the back door.  He bounced through the kitchen, where I was sitting with my coffee.  When he bounced back past me, I reached out and grabbed his arm, pulling him into a hug as I planted a humming kiss on the side of his face.

“Stranger-danger-stranger-danger!!”  He shouted. 

When I let him go, he looked at me with his goofy grinning mug.  “What was that for?”

“You’re a terrific kid.” I told him.",7,1752294441.0,FathersJourney,0,1.0,False

Had my mom's funeral today. For the first few days I think I was in a state of shock/sadness/numbness. The funeral itself was hard but I'm not one to want to let my emotions out around just anyone. 

Came home, had some dinner with my boyfriend, took my dog for a couple walks, just tried to relax. 

Laying in bed just staring at my phone with my boyfriend beside me and just burst into tears. I couldn't get it to stop. I'd just get myself calmed down and than it'd start again. 

I don't know where to go from here. My hearts shattered. She was so integrated into my life.

*And soon he was caught on the DnD hooks,*

*He learned to roll dice and he bought all the books.*

*Sometimes over coffee, sometimes over ale,*

*He’d gather his friends and they’d work out a tale.*

*An ancient, lost city, way out in the dunes.*

*Enchanted glades ringing with haunting, fey tunes.*

*An Arthurian quest, or a mystery thriller,*

*A forest, a cabin, a shadowy killer.*

*A tropical island, a grim burning waste.*

*A chef of fine stories must season to taste.*

*And so, my dear reader, I’ll ask if I’m able*

*“Will you take a seat and roll dice at my table?”*

1lxrf8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lxrf8p/i_told_my_brother_i_am_struggling_to_like_his/,I told my brother I am struggling to like his girlfriend AITAH,"I (20f) am having trouble accepting my brothers (24M) girlfriend (22f) She grew up and lives in the same town as us so she’s not far just for context. We both live at home. Sorry that this is a very long post, I just need to explain in depth why I feel this way. 

One of the first things that rubbed me the wrong way was before I had ever even spoken to her in depth my brother had got me a shirt that said “im annoying” for my “joke” birthday gift (a thing our family does before the real gift), and when he had told her about the shirt on the phone while he had her on speaker, she responded saying, “that’s so perfect for her it fits her personality perfectly” as if we’re familiars, I felt that was rude. 

one of the first times she came over to our house she was telling my mom how she felt her kitchen should be arranged. She talked down to my brother in front of my parents, and they couldn’t believe how she was demanding things from him like a servant (which she has since stopped since he had a conversation with her about it). 

Another time she demanded that I watch our cats while my parents go out of town so that she can stay the week, but I already had plans & my brother had promised my mom 3 weeks before she invited herself over that he would watch our cats, she called me a brat and curse words, when I offered half the week and changed my plans. Another thing anytime my brother is asked to feed the animals or help with anything when she’s here he acts like a complete jerk and she tells him we’re “using him”, for context my mom just bought him a 10,000 car after he crashed his, he doesn’t pay rent, and she asks for help with small around the house things. He says she was raised very spoiled and was never asked for anything so to her It’s unacceptable that he’s asked to do things by people that aren’t her. 

I borrowed a couple cotton round flats from my brother that have salicylic acid on them because we both use the same one, he borrowed it from me countless times and I just thought it was something we share, but he ended up getting mad about it suddenly and told me to stop using it and I said okay and I didn’t use it again. Then a few days later I was looking for a soap that my best friend got custom-made for me in Colorado for my birthday that was in a box under my side of the sink, I found it in the shower used. I asked my brother and they had gone under my sink and opened/ used it, he said sorry but she overheard and yelled “don’t apologize to her she used your acne pads.” I felt like that was totally rude for her to jump into our conversation and team up against me. He later clarified to her that he had used mine before as well, and she said that it didn’t matter. 

My dad wakes up at 5 AM for work every day and she’ll come over and sometimes overstay her welcome being here sometimes a week and be loud until 12 in the morning laughing on the top of her lungs. I also had to tell my brother to say something because she would leave her products/items scattered all over the counter to where I couldn’t even get ready for bed, she put her personal items on of my makeup container (my only item on the sink in the corner), and she apparently responded by calling me bossy. 

She moved my mom’s stuff and took an entire large basket on our pantry rack for her coffee/ snacks and demands that no one is allowed to touch it. Meanwhile, my mom pays for all her groceries when she’s here. I would never take space in someone’s home when I don’t live there, who does that? 

My brother invited her to my intimate birthday event without asking and I told him to uninvite her because it was just him and my cousin and I felt it was rude. He just invited her to my parents anniversary surprise party that I was throwing that I spent all the money for, without asking, knowing my mom isn’t super fond of her. He automatically invites her onto her trips without talking to anyone else in the family even when he’s not the one paying. I don’t even go if I know she’s going so I haven’t been on the past 2 family weekend trips.  Nobody else in my family will say anything because they feel extremely uncomfortable. The only time it was ever called out was on my birthday. 

They have been dating one year and she will often get angry if he says he wants to wait to get married by giving him the silent treatment. She’s pressuring him to marry her frequently. He had to get her a promise ring, and it still has not made her chill. This person constantly being around and me feeling like I can’t even enjoy time with my family anymore sucks, my home doesn’t feel like a safe space anymore. I feel very uncomfortable around her. I asked my brother to go on a little road trip a couple towns over for the day just us and he told me only if he can invite her. 

I openly told him I am struggling to like her and I’m not fond of being around her, it went badly obviously - sorry again for the long post AITAH",0,1752294043.0,AITAH,4,0.5,False
1lxrels,https://i.redd.it/7erhz94oddcf1.jpeg,What coffee table and side tables?,"New rug and couch.  Drapes off picture are blue. Side tables and lamp need to go.  

What color tables would look good?  Black seems too harsh.  A wood isn’t sitting right with me as there seems to be so much brown already.  I don’t like any blue coffee table that I find.  

I will eventually be getting an accent chair and maybe some footstools if I end up with enough space to store them.
