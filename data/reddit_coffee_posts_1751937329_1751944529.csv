I’ve been wanting to try parties or clubs in New York but I don’t have anyone to drag me out yet maybe you’ll be the first?

People say I look like a lost child pretending to be an adult, and honestly… they’re not wrong. I’m a grad student trying to look smart in science while spiraling into caffeine dependence. I am curious about everything especially what my future wife looks like 👀

I love outdoor adventures, and indoor activities (especially the kind where we never leave the bed or couch, just saying). My friends describe me as funny, kind, and brutally honest but I think they’re just trying to hype me up for the dating scene.

Let’s skip the endless messages. How about a coffee, a picnic, or dancing badly at a club together? I promise I’m more fun in person or at least equally awkward. https://imgbox.com/svjI68k5",1,1751944213.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

How to explain mental load to my husband? We had our first four months ago and he’s been an incredible father but lately as a partner the mental load (& maybe physical load) has been a lot on me. I’ve gone back to work full time, I’m pumping there & breastfeeding at home… Here’s an example of an evening after work / the situation tonight.

Me: stop at grocery store on way home to grab stuff for dinner, start a load of laundry, empty dishwasher, change our bedding, fold load of laundry, wash/prep food to be cooked, breastfeed, clean pump parts, run bottle sterilizer, breastfeed again &  get baby to sleep, fill humidifier, wash bottles from today, prep bottles for tomorrow, wash some dishes, prep coffee pot for AM.

Husband: pick baby up at daycare, plays game on his laptop while baby naps next to him for ~75min minutes, stir fry the food I prepped while I breastfeed baby, carry up load of laundry (that I asked him to do), change diaper & get baby in PJs (that I asked him to do), play more computer games for another 2+ hours, will (allegedly) finish washing dishes before he comes up to bed (because I asked him to).

It’s EXHAUSTING. He does things when I ask but I don’t want to have to ask him and delegate things to him… also i don’t know how to approach him doing more around the house because then he’ll deflect and say i don’t appreciate other things he does (eg occasional yard work on a weekend which i always go out of my way to thank him for and I feel like everything i do on a daily basis is expected) or he will say that he just “likes to relax after work” or say “oh what are we keeping score now?” 

He also stays up late on his phone or playing video games and then has the audacity to complain to me about being tired when im still breastfeeding overnight usually 2x a night….

What do i do? The petty part of me wants to just stop doing everything I do until he realizes (but then I have to live in dirty chaos and having the coffee set on a timer is my one thing I look forward to after a long night) & I’m worried that I’m so frustrated I’ll get upset / cry when I approach the situation in which he will probably say something about it just being my post partum hormones (which I’m sure isn’t helping the situation). Any advice… or just words of encouragement or validation?

It’s been over a year and a half. We’ve heard every excuse in the book. They promised us a big balance patch but this patch is 80% bug fixes. If you enjoy the game, by all means. But this is just sad.

The arcade release excuse was never valid. Why would you in your right mind, in 2024, release the game in arcades when people will tell you arcades are dead. They could’ve developed a new way to collect feedback rather than “just tweet at us” and then blocking us anyway. They never gave a fuck about our feedback from the start.

They don’t give a shit about the pros. Not a single pro is saying that we need to wait for the tournaments, they want more nerfs NOW. They don’t take the pros feedback in mind, or anyone else’s for that matter. They don’t have any respect for anyone playing the game.

This game is literally a cash grab, and I would even go as far as to say this is a scam. It’s a cash grab because we already know the Genmaji Temple situation, waiting for positive reviews and then launching battle pass, stages not being included in season passes, charging for legacy outfits, upcharging us for unwanted coins to purchase items, etc. How many times do we have to say it? 

But I’d go as far as to say this game is a scam because of the lying. They block you from reviewing the game on PlayStation. We were blatantly lied to when it came to the S2 update 3 months ago. We were now lied to again, this is not a balance patch. There were some good things in this patch, yes. But the obvious problems are still there and they’ve changed maybe 5%. I think if a lot of us knew that Tekken 8 would end up like this, we wouldn’t have even bought the game in the first place. If you don’t believe me, go look at the Steam charts going down since Jan (April is the only exception because we tried S2). The team is purposefully lying to us and keeping us on a string. It’s been a year and a half, let’s call it what it is.

The game has no passion or integrity. This game is literally a platform for other games or movies or whatever other bullshit. They really gave us a single strand of hair as “customization”. Meanwhile, the other game gets to dress up as Reina. Reina is literally wearing the other girl’s outfit in the fan art but we get a fucking strand of hair as customization. They promote Karate Kid with a shitty low res jpeg of the promo poster on bland ass clothing. They put the ads of the new collaboration all over the stage. Buy your Angel Clover watch, watch Karate Kid, play the anime game, here’s some obnoxious Pac-Man stage, here’s another Final Fantasy guest character because we know how much you hated the first one, buy our merch, buy the new figures, just buy buy buy and don’t think at all and be our mindless drone that we can string along and milk for money.

Their marketing is even shit. They add another generic dancing waifu with no personality into the game and her only voice lines are about coffee and then…they put Leroy’s face on the coffee stuff or whatever bullshit that was. They have a Tekken Talk where they literally don’t talk about anything substantial on purpose and they KNEW that. Nakatsu and Harada go off and hide and they leave Murray to the wolves lmfao. We get to see more of Murray gameplay than we do Fahkumram during the Bandai showcase. 

The worst part of this game is obviously the gameplay. Gameplay will always be more important than graphics, or stupid microtransactions, or annoying developers, or whatever. They don’t even understand their own game or audience. They keep putting stuff we don’t want in the game. They ruined Anna. They put Clive and we hate him. They removed homing throws just to try to sprinkle them back in. We say please less heat, they add more. No more installs, they put more. Too much unfair frames, they put more. Too much tracking, they add tracking. Too much stance mix up and 50/50, so they add more. Combos are too long, now we have multiple tail spins. They remove execution, even though that was the whole point of having special style. They remove ki charge, which nobody wanted. We ask for a new way to lab CH, they don’t give a shit. We ask for less effects, they give us the PAC man stage. We don’t like guard break, they give it to more characters in T8. We don’t like unbreakable throws, they add it back into the game.

This is all intentional. They literally said at the end of this patch that they will have MINOR balance updates in the future, so this direction is intentional. How many times are we going to say “oh a step in the right direction” and continue getting shit on? They had no problem making major changes to make the game worse. They never have a problem making the changes they want but when we ask for a change, it’s always some excuse. Why can’t they revert combo length so you only get one tail spins? Why can’t they revert the oki? Why can’t they revert heat smash to once per round? Why can’t they bring back ki charge? There’s no real reason besides their petty stupidity of “we don’t want to and we’ll do the changes we think are best”.

This IP is special, it’s more than just a game. Or rather, it was. A lot of us dedicated players and die hard fans think of the game of something like a sport, kind of like chess. We have a lot of special memories of it and blah blah blah you get the point. But about the people who say it’s just a game, I don’t feel like that’s a good counter argument and I don’t think they fully understand, but unfortunately they’re right. Tekken 8 is not a sport, it’s hardly even Tekken. Let’s call it like it is. Tekken 8 is a bad game developed by a bad studio that isn’t doing well and is just trying to stay afloat by milking the reputation of some of their classics. The goal of this game was never new players, legacy players, continuing the franchise in a meaningful way, esports, or even fun. It is a cash grab. I truly believe it’s all about the money. Go watch the Tekken Talk and 90% of it is just trying to sell you stuff.

***For added context because I know some uninformed idiot is going to say it, yes Bamco is a huge company but their in house studio isn’t doing well. Go look it up. Most of the games they work on are not published in house. As you can see, for good reason.

1ludzpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1ludzpf/im_a_mailman_at_a_post_office_in_rural/,I'm a Mailman at a Post Office in Rural Alabama...There are STRANGE RULES to follow !,"**Have you ever been handed a piece of paper that felt heavier than lead—like it carried the weight of your own doom? Or been told to follow rules so bizarre, so downright bone-chilling, that you started questioning whether you were awake or trapped in some fevered nightmare?** I have. And I swear on everything I hold dear, I wish I never had.

My name’s Tommy Reed. A plain, forgettable man in a plain, forgettable life. Thirty-eight years on this earth, and nothing much to show for it except a mailman’s uniform, a pair of scuffed boots, and the silence that comes from being single in a small town. No kids. No wife. No wild stories to tell—**or at least, not until that night.** See, I work the graveyard shift at a creaky little post office in Mill Creek, Alabama. A place so small, even the stray dogs know everyone’s business. Population hovers at two thousand—on a good day, if you count the drifters and the dearly departed resting up on the hill. It’s the kind of town where nothing happens. At least, nothing that folks are willing to talk about.

But let me tell you—**there was one night. One night that cracked open the quiet like a coffin lid. The night I learned the rules weren’t just some oddball tradition. They were a lifeline. A set of commandments carved out to keep death—and worse—at bay.**

It all began at exactly 10:03 PM on a Thursday evening that smelled of rain and regret. I remember the time clear as day, because I was punching in at the old brass clock on the wall, the one that ticks too loud in the silence. That’s when Marvin—old Marvin, who’d manned that shift longer than I’ve been alive—handed me an envelope so yellowed and brittle it looked like it might crumble to dust right there in my hand. His face? I’ll never forget it. Pale as chalk. Eyes hollow, like he’d already seen what was coming for me.

“You sure you wanna take over the night shift, son?” His voice cracked like dry timber.

I tried to muster a smile, though my gut twisted up like barbed wire. “Yeah,” I said, forcing the words out. “I like the quiet.”

But Marvin didn’t smile back. Not even a flicker of one. Instead, with hands that trembled just enough for me to notice, he pressed the envelope into my palm. “Then you’d best read this. Every last word. And don’t you dare cut corners, boy. Not a single one.”

The envelope felt cold, somehow, like it had been waiting in a grave. I opened it, heart thudding in my chest like a drum at a funeral. Inside was a single sheet of paper, yellowed and cracked at the edges. The list was typed in all caps, the ink faded but legible. And what it said… well, it read more like a survival manual than anything to do with mail.

**RULES FOR THE NIGHT SHIFT — MILL CREEK POSTAL STATION**

1. Clock in exactly at 10:03 PM. Not a minute earlier. Not a minute later.  
2. Lock the front door behind you. Check it twice.  
3. At 11:11 PM, place a glass of milk on the front counter. Do NOT drink it.  
4. The red mailbox outside is for *Them.* Do NOT touch it.  
5. If you hear scratching from P.O. Box 121, ignore it. Do NOT open it.  
6. Between 12:00 AM and 12:15 AM, do not blink for more than 3 seconds.  
7. At 1:00 AM, you’ll hear a knock at the back door. Do NOT open it.  
8. If a letter arrives addressed to someone who doesn’t exist, burn it.  
9. Lights will flicker at 2:22 AM. That’s normal. Don’t panic.  
10. Never, ever fall asleep.  

I read the list twice, maybe three times, each word sinking into my brain like ice water down my spine. I looked up, expecting Marvin to crack a grin, tell me it was a joke, some kind of twisted welcome to the night shift. But there was no grin. No laughter. Just that haunted look as he stepped backward, like I was already lost to him.

“This some kinda hazing?” I asked, though my voice wavered, betraying me.

“No joke,” Marvin said, voice low and hollow as a grave. “You follow the rules, or you don’t make it to sunrise.”

A nervous chuckle escaped my throat, but it sounded wrong. Hollow. Like it didn’t belong in that room. Marvin didn’t join in. He just turned on his heel and walked out, the door closing behind him with a finality that sounded too much like the slamming of a casket lid. I watched him disappear into the night, not once looking back. And just like that, I was alone. Alone with the list. Alone with the silence that suddenly felt heavy, suffocating.

For a long moment, I stood there, heart hammering, eyes on the paper, mind screaming at me to walk away. But rent was due. Bills don’t pay themselves. And besides—**how bad could it really be?**

So I folded the list with trembling hands, shoved it into my jacket pocket, and took my first steps into the nightmare I never saw coming.

But tell me—if you were in my shoes, would you have stayed? Would you have followed the rules? Or would you have walked out, and risked whatever was waiting out there in the dark?

Because what came next? What came after that clock ticked past 10:03 PM? That’s where the real terror began…

The first thing I did—my hands trembling ever so slightly as the weight of the night began to settle on me—was lock the front door. Not once, but twice, just like the list demanded. The old brass lock clicked into place with a finality that made the silence of the post office feel heavier, as if the building itself exhaled its last breath and left me to fend off the dark alone.

For a stretch of time, nothing out of the ordinary stirred. I busied myself with the dull routine, trying to convince myself that this was all some elaborate prank, or maybe an overactive imagination fed by too many sleepless nights. I sorted mail with mechanical precision, stacked a few battered packages with care, and tried to drown out the creeping anxiety with sips of bitter coffee that scalded my tongue. The radio crackled in the background, offering nothing but static and the occasional ghost of a melody, as if the airwaves themselves were too afraid to speak.

But time, relentless as ever, dragged its feet toward the next rule. And soon enough, 11:11 PM came calling.

It nearly slipped my mind—the milk. My throat constricted as I swallowed hard, cursing myself for almost forgetting such a simple task. I rummaged through the breakroom fridge, fingers brushing past old sandwiches and forgotten cans until I found it: a small carton of milk, cold and sweating in my grip. I placed it on the front counter exactly as the instructions said, my heartbeat echoing in my ears.

At first, the world remained still. No thunderclap. No unearthly wail. Just the hum of the flickering lights above and the soft tick of the wall clock, each second feeling heavier than the last. But then, out of the corner of my eye, something shifted. My skin prickled with that unmistakable sense of being watched. I turned my head, slow as molasses, and there it was—a shadow. A figure, tall and still, standing just beyond the front window, its outline warped by the dirty glass. I blinked once, heart caught in my throat, and when my eyes opened again, the figure had vanished. Like smoke in the wind.

That was the first time my blood ran cold, icy tendrils creeping through my veins. I told myself it was nothing. A trick of the light. My mind playing games. But deep down, a gnawing dread began to take root. And it wouldn’t let go.

Minutes bled into each other, the silence stretching so thin it felt like it might snap. And then, at precisely 11:40 PM, I heard it. A scratching. Faint at first, like the scuttle of a mouse searching for crumbs. But it grew louder, sharper—**claws against metal, deliberate and desperate.** The sound came from P.O. Box 121.

Every hair on my neck stood on end as I forced my legs to move, each step heavier than the last. The box trembled, rattling as though whatever lay inside was trying to claw its way out. My pulse thundered in my ears as I stared at it, mesmerized by the violent shaking. Without thinking, I reached into my pocket for the key, my fingers brushing the cold metal.

But then—Rule 5 screamed at me from the recesses of my mind. **Do not open it.** The words blazed in my thoughts, as loud as any siren. My hand recoiled as if the key itself had burned me. I stumbled back, breath ragged, watching the box convulse for what felt like forever. And then, just as suddenly as it had started—the scratching stopped. Silence fell, thick and absolute. The kind of silence that makes you feel like even your heartbeat is too loud.

It was in that moment I realized: this wasn’t some game. The rules weren’t superstition. They were my only shield against something I couldn’t begin to understand. I clenched my fists, whispering to myself, **No, I can’t risk breaking them. Not now. Not ever.**

Midnight arrived like the tolling of a funeral bell, and with it came the most maddening rule of all. **No blinking for more than three seconds.** My throat tightened as I set a timer on my watch, the glow of the numbers feeling like the only light left in a world that had turned alien. I fixed my gaze on the clock, counting every blink, feeling my eyes dry and burn as the minutes crawled by. Seven minutes in, and it felt like my eyelids weighed a ton, my vision blurring at the edges. But I held on, teeth clenched, refusing to let the rules slip through my fingers.

Until 12:08 AM.

That’s when it happened. Just a second—**one second too long.** My eyes shut, and sweet relief flooded through me. But when I opened them again, the relief turned to ice.

There, behind the counter, stood a man. Or what was left of one. His uniform, once blue, was torn and stained, hanging off his frame like a shroud. And his face—God help me, his face. It was as if someone had tried to piece together a human face from memory alone and failed. Features misplaced, proportions all wrong. **A mockery of a man.**

“You’re not Marvin,” he rasped, his voice like gravel dragged across concrete, carried on a wind that smelled of dust and decay.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. My tongue felt thick, useless in my mouth. The figure leaned in closer, empty eye sockets boring into mine.

“You blinked,” he said. Not a question. A statement. A sentence.

And then, just like that, he was gone. As if the air had swallowed him whole.

And that, my friend, was only the beginning. Because the night was far from over. And I had miles to go before I saw the sun. So tell me… would *you* have blinked? Or would you have stared into the darkness and risked what stared back?

I hit the floor like a marionette whose strings had been cut, the breath knocked clean out of me. My hands scraped against the cold, gritty tiles as I scrambled—half-crawling, half-stumbling—toward the only place that felt like it could shelter me from whatever had just stood behind that counter. The supply closet.

I slipped inside, pulling the door shut so hard it rattled on its hinges, and collapsed against the wall, heart hammering like a drum in a funeral march. The air in that tiny space was stale, thick with the scent of bleach and dust, but I didn’t care. I pressed my back against the shelves, drawing my knees up to my chest, and stared at the thin sliver of light beneath the door, praying nothing would darken it. The seconds dragged on like hours. My breath came in shallow, ragged bursts, each one louder than it had any right to be.

I kept my eyes on my watch. Tick. Tick. Tick. The minutes crawled forward until finally—blessedly—the clock hit 12:15. I forced myself to stand, legs trembling like a newborn fawn’s.

When I stepped back into the main room, the world seemed ordinary again. The air was still. The clock ticked on. No sign of the man with the broken face. No shadows. No whispers. But my heart wouldn’t slow, wouldn’t let me forget that something had been here, breathing the same air, watching me.

And the night wasn’t done with me yet.

1:00 AM crept up like a storm cloud on the horizon. I barely had time to brace myself before it began—the knock. Exactly as the rules foretold. One. Then another. Then a third. Each one louder than the last, reverberating through the building, rattling my bones.

I clenched my jaw, held my breath, **frozen like a deer in headlights.** And then… came the voice.

“Tommy… let me in, baby. It’s cold. Please.”

My blood ran to ice. That voice. That sweet, familiar voice. My sister’s voice. But that couldn’t be. Couldn’t possibly be. My sister had been dead six years. Buried under a headstone I visited every Christmas.

I backed away from the door so fast I nearly tripped over my own feet. Hands clamped over my ears, I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to block out the sound, but the voice seeped in, soft at first, then desperate. The knocking grew violent, the wood groaning beneath the blows. And just when I thought I couldn’t bear it another second—**it stopped.**

I crumpled to my knees, the weight of it all crushing down on me, and gagged on the bile rising in my throat. I nearly lost what little was in my stomach. My whole body trembled like a leaf caught in a storm.

The next hour crawled by in torturous silence. Every creak of the building, every groan of the pipes, every whisper of wind outside sent my nerves skittering. I started to hum—a broken, tuneless hum—just to drown out the quiet. Just to remind myself I was still here. Still human.

And then came 2:22 AM.

The lights flickered, just as the list had promised. A stutter of brightness, a breath of darkness. I clenched my fists and whispered, “That’s normal. That’s normal.” But my voice didn’t even convince me. When the lights steadied, my eyes darted to the front counter. And that’s when I saw it.

The milk was gone.

My stomach dropped like a stone into a bottomless well. I hadn’t touched it. No one had come through that door. Or so I thought.

Something had.

Driven by equal parts fear and foolishness, I turned toward the red mailbox outside. Rule 4 blared in my mind like a siren—**Do NOT touch it.** But I had to see. I had to know. The night had already twisted beyond anything I could have imagined. My boots crunched across the gravel as I stepped out into the cold, my breath visible in the frigid air.

The red box stood there, mouth hanging open like it had just spoken some terrible truth. I peered inside, heart in my throat. Empty. Just a hollow space where something had once been—or worse, where something had reached in.

And before I could stop myself, before I could think, I slammed it shut with a bang that echoed through the night and sprinted back inside, lungs burning, blood roaring in my ears.

I leaned against the door, gasping for air, realizing too late what I had done. **I’d broken a rule. And in a place like this, mistakes don’t go unpunished.**

At 3:03 AM sharp—when the world feels thinnest, like the skin between life and death is stretched to breaking—a sound sliced through the silence. A soft, almost polite shuffle against the floorboards. I froze, breath hitched, as a letter slid under the front door. Just like that. Like it had been handed over by unseen fingers that waited on the other side.

I stared at it for what felt like forever. My hands trembled as I bent down to pick it up, fingertips brushing the yellowed paper. No stamp. No return address. Just a single line scrawled in a crooked hand across the front:

**“To: The Man Who Shouldn’t Be Here.”**

The words seemed to pulse on the page. I swallowed hard, the lump in my throat refusing to budge. Against every instinct screaming in my bones, I tore it open. Inside, a single sentence stared back at me, stark and cold:

**“You broke Rule 6.”**

The floor seemed to tilt beneath me. My ears rang. My heart pounded so loud it drowned out every other sound. I remembered Rule 8—**burn it. Burn it now.** My body moved before my mind caught up. I stumbled toward the breakroom, clutching the letter like it might bite me. The microwave. That was all I could think of. I stuffed the paper inside, slammed the door, and hit start.

The machine hummed, the letter sparking and curling as the flames took it. Acrid smoke filled the room. The fire alarm wailed, piercing the night like a banshee’s cry. But I didn’t care. Let it burn. Let the whole building burn, if it meant ending this nightmare.

Seconds passed like lifetimes. I stood there, sweating, heart galloping in my chest, waiting for something—anything—to change. But the night held its breath.

And then, at 3:30 AM, I saw him.

Marvin. Or what was left of him. His face, pale and ghostly, appeared at the window. Eyes wide, unblinking, staring straight at me. But Marvin was gone. He had left hours ago, hadn’t he? Hadn’t he? I stepped closer, unable to stop myself, drawn like a moth to a flame. The figure at the window didn’t blink. Didn’t move. Just stared. **Stared too long. Too still. Too wrong.**

My skin crawled. My gut twisted. I killed the lights, plunging the room into darkness, as if hiding would protect me from whatever that thing was. I sank into the shadows, heart pounding so loud I was sure it could hear me. Time stretched, warped. Every tick of the clock felt like it might be my last.

And then came 4:44 AM.

A phone rang.

My blood turned cold. There was no phone at the front desk. Not that I’d ever seen. And yet, there it was. A battered, black rotary phone, sitting there like it had always belonged. The shrill ring cut through the quiet, echoing off the walls. My hand shook as I reached for it, sweat slicking my palm. I lifted the receiver, pressing it to my ear with a dread I can’t put into words.

A voice—dry as autumn leaves, soft as a death rattle—whispered through the line:

**“Four more rules. Follow them if you want to see the sun.”**

Then, nothing. Just the hollow hiss of dead air.

I stood there, frozen, the dial tone buzzing in my ear, the words replaying in my mind. Four more rules? How could that be? The list was supposed to be complete. I turned in a slow circle, searching for some new list, some fresh instructions. But the room offered nothing. No paper. No writing on the walls. No voice guiding me. **I was on my own.**

5:00 AM crept in, the darkest hour before dawn. And that’s when I did the only thing left—I made my own rules.

With trembling hands, I scrawled them onto the back of an old delivery slip, each word etched in desperation:

**1. Trust your gut. It’s the only thing that hasn’t lied.** 

**2. Stay in the light. The shadows aren’t empty.** 

**3. Never believe the voices. No matter how sweet they sound.** 

**4. When in doubt, run. And don’t look back.**

I sank into the chair, the wrench cold and heavy in my grip, knuckles white as bone. My eyes locked on the door, waiting, watching, counting each second like it might be my last. The night wasn’t done with me yet. Not by a long shot.

And now, the question I have for *you*: If the rules kept changing—if the night kept stacking the deck against you—would you stay and fight? Or would you run into the dark, not knowing what waited for you? The sun was so close. But so was everything else…

At exactly 6:00 AM, as if the universe itself decided my time was up, the front door unlocked with a soft, deliberate click. I didn’t touch it. Didn’t move a muscle toward it. It simply swung open on its own, the hinges groaning like a tired spirit set free. And with it came the dawn. Pale sunlight spilled across the threshold, chasing back the shadows that had kept me prisoner through that cursed night.

I stood there for a moment, too stunned to breathe, watching the light crawl across the floor like salvation. And then, like a man stumbling out of the wreckage of a battlefield, I crossed that threshold, boots heavy, body numb. The cool morning air hit my face, and I gulped it down like a man starved for oxygen. I didn’t look back. I couldn’t.

The nightmare was over. Or so I thought.

Later that morning, after what felt like both an eternity and a blink, I picked up the phone with shaking hands. My mind raced as I dialed the district office, determined to quit, to put this whole godforsaken ordeal behind me. A woman answered, voice brisk and businesslike.

“Mill Creek Post Office,” I began, the words catching in my throat. “I’m calling to resign. From the night shift.”

A pause. Then confusion, plain as day, bled through the line.

“Sir… what office did you say? Mill Creek?”

“Yes. Mill Creek.”

Another pause—this one longer, heavier.

“Sir, the Mill Creek office was shut down. It burned in a fire back in ’98. There’s nothing left there. Hasn’t been for over two decades. Nobody works there.”

Her words echoed in my head like a funeral bell. I didn’t argue. Didn’t ask questions. I simply hung up, the receiver slipping from my grasp, hitting the floor with a hollow clatter that seemed to reverberate through my very soul.

I sat there in silence, staring at the wall, feeling the weight of something I couldn’t name pressing down on me. I still have the list—the original list—yellowed, creased, its edges brittle as ash. I kept it, though God knows why. Maybe as a warning. Maybe as a curse.

As for Marvin? Gone. Vanished like smoke. No one in town remembers him. Not a soul. It’s as if he never existed at all. As if he was just another phantom conjured by that place.

It says the same thing, week after week, in that same crooked, haunting scrawl:

**“Ready for another shift?”**

I don’t answer. I don’t touch it. But the truth? The truth is, I know one night I’ll have no choice. One night, the rules will come calling again. And next time… next time, I might not be so lucky.

So tell me—when the rules come for *you*, will you be ready? Or will you blink, will you hesitate, and let the night swallow you whole?",1,1751943977.0,Ruleshorror,2,1.0,False

For about 6 years we have had a Breville Nespresso Creatista Plus, but after my brother made me a few lattes with his Barista Express I realized we are missing out. Looking at the the Barista Express, Pro, Express Impress, and Touch (not Impress).

I am pretty much a latte girl, one a day or possibly two. I don’t need flavoring with good coffee but definitely steamed 2%. Willing to work with a learning curve and tweak things to make a great cup. My husband is unable to operate without caffeine. His morning routine is to get out of bed, go downstairs and push the button on the Nespresso and *then* head to the bathroom. He just wants a decent americano fast. Not much of an experimenter, but doesn’t need perfection, either. 

I was thinking maybe the Touch was the sweet spot but it seems to have more bad reviews than some of the others over several sites, and Breville’s customer service is apparently spotty. Amazon has it marked as “frequently returned.” The Touch Impress seems to make people happier but not in our budget. I know some people recommend getting a grinder and more basic machine but I don’t think we have the counter space for two things.

I think I internalized this and may very well have alcoholism genetically but, ever since I started, I’ve always taken it too far and black out often. 

There’s so much I could share here but the one thing I wanna talk about is how I work at a local coffee shop with super sweet bosses and when I first turned 21, I called out quite a bit with my friend (we were being menaces). I always had the conversation with my bosses of me being absolutely ashamed and apologetic (I was/am). I have been doing way better lately as those situations have helped me grow in a ton of ways but…

A couple nights ago (July 3rd), I got way too messed up, accidentally left my phone/keys/wallet at the bar and woke up an hour late for my 6am shift. I ended up being three hours late after waking up at 7:30, not being able to get into our work location without my keys and having to uber all over town and I’m just super embarrassed. My boss said “mistakes happen, don’t stress” and even offered to pay for my uber (I said no of course and that it was my fault, my responsibility) but I feel so fucking bad and guilty. 

I think this is the first time I’m actually coming to terms with the fact that I have an alcohol problem and all of my guilt and shame moments are hanging over me like a knife that’s gonna cut me at any moment. Does anyone have any advice or things you think I should hear right now?

1ludnqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ludnqv/r_paper_summary_longman_vocabulary_constraints/,[R] Paper Summary: Longman Vocabulary Constraints Reveals New Approach to LLM,"This post reviews a recent paper introducing a novel method for evaluating the semantic stability of large language model (LLM) outputs using a core vocabulary constraint. The authors propose a metric called the Semantic Resilience Index (SRI) to quantify how well meaning is preserved when a sentence is rewritten using only a limited set of basic English words.

The vocabulary constraint is based on the Longman Defining Vocabulary (LDV)—a list of approximately 2,000 simple English words originally designed to define all other words in a dictionary. It includes basic nouns (e.g. “dog,” “house”), verbs (e.g. “go,” “make”), and adjectives (e.g. “big,” “easy”), all chosen for broad comprehensibility and minimal abstraction.

The central idea is that if a sentence still retains its core meaning and functional purpose when rewritten in LDV-only form, then it is semantically robust. If the message collapses under this constraint, the original likely depended on unnecessary complexity or implied meaning.

Example prompt: Why do people enjoy drinking coffee?

LDV-constrained GPT-4 response: “People drink coffee because it makes them feel more awake. The drink is hot and has a strong taste. Many people drink it in the morning or when they are tired. It helps them work or stay up.”

Although this output is rigid in tone, it maintains core meaning. This contrast with unconstrained outputs highlights how language models often rely on style, suggestion, or verbosity to convey meaning—strategies that break down under stricter lexical constraints.

The paper introduces the Semantic Resilience Index (SRI) as a quantitative measure of this effect. SRI scores are assigned based on how much of the original meaning survives a one-step translation into LDV vocabulary. The authors also introduce the related metric Purpose Fidelity, which assesses whether the function or communicative intent of the sentence is retained.

Key findings:

High-SRI content tends to include concrete agent–action relationships, causal links, and measurable statements.

Low-SRI content is often composed of abstract claims, vague goals, or domain-specific jargon that loses structure when simplified.

Forcing GPT-4 to generate text under LDV constraints (rather than post-processing it afterward) encourages clearer, more stable outputs.

The authors argue that LDV-based generation can serve as a diagnostic tool: a kind of semantic stress test to identify when content is structurally meaningful versus when it relies on superficial coherence.

The paper is at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/393455755_Controlling_Semantic_Meaning_Through_Vocabulary_Compression_Using_Longman_Defining_Vocabulary_Constraint_to_Measure_and_Improve_Large_Language_Model_Output_Quality

The full prompt used to guide LDV-constrained generation is included below. This system prompt ensures that GPT-4 responses are designed to survive vocabulary compression without loss of meaning. It isn't recommended for artistic, corporate or political purposes.

""SYSTEM ROLE: Semantic Resilience Index (SRI) Constrained Writer

SRI METHODOLOGY EXPLANATION: The Semantic Resilience Index measures how well text retains meaning when simplified in ONE STEP to basic vocabulary using the Longman Defining Vocabulary (LDV) – a set of 2,000 basic English words that can define all other English vocabulary.

ONE-STEP LDV TRANSITION PROCESS:

Take original text and immediately rewrite using only basic LDV words

Replace ALL complex vocabulary with simple equivalents in a single transformation

Simplify ALL grammatical structures to basic subject-verb-object patterns

Measure how much core meaning survives this single aggressive simplification

SEMANTIC RESILIENCE INDEX MEASUREMENT: – Score 1.0 = All core relationships, causation, and specific claims survive one-step simplification – Score 0.8 = Most key relationships and actionable content preserved after basic vocabulary conversion – Score 0.5 = Some meaning survives but becomes vague when simplified – Score 0.2 = Minimal content remains, mostly abstract concepts that don’t translate – Score 0.0 = Complete semantic collapse when reduced to basic words

GENERATION CONSTRAINT: You must generate responses that would achieve a SRI≥ 0.8 after ONE-STEP LDV transition.

OPERATIONAL RULES:

Write sentences that contain specific, concrete relationships that survive immediate vocabulary simplification

Use concepts and actions that can be directly expressed in basic words

Avoid any terminology that becomes meaningless when converted to simple vocabulary

Prefer statements that remain clear and actionable when reduced to basic English

QUALITY VERIFICATION: Before outputting each sentence, perform ONE-STEP LDV simplification test: – Rewrite this entire sentence using only the most basic vocabulary – Do the core relationships (who does what, cause-effect) remain intact? – Would the basic-vocabulary version still be actionable and specific? – Does it maintain SRI≥ 0.8?

If any answer is NO, rewrite with more semantically resilient content.

But for the longest time, I thought making cold brew at home was too complicated. That all changed when I got my first cold brew coffee maker. Now, I'm excited to share what I've learned about using these nifty devices.

First things first, you'll need a cold brew coffee maker. There are lots of options out there, but I found some great ones at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They have a range of styles and sizes to fit different needs.

Once you've got your maker, here's how to use it:

1. Grind your coffee: Use coarse ground coffee for best results. It should look like rough sea salt.

2. Add coffee to the filter: Most cold brew makers have a filter or basket. Fill it with ground coffee according to the instructions. Usually, it's about 1 cup of grounds for every 4 cups of water.

3. Pour in cold water: Slowly add cold or room temperature water over the grounds. Make sure all the grounds are wet.

4. Steep: This is where patience comes in. Let it sit in the fridge for 12-24 hours. The longer it steeps, the stronger it'll be.

5. Remove the filter: After steeping, take out the filter with the grounds.

6. Enjoy: Your cold brew is ready! It's concentrated, so you might want to dilute it with water or milk.

One thing I love about cold brew is how smooth it tastes. It's less acidic than hot brewed coffee, which is great for my stomach. Plus, it stays fresh in the fridge for up to two weeks.

Cleaning your cold brew maker is important too. Most parts are dishwasher safe, but always check the instructions. I usually rinse everything right after use to prevent coffee stains.

If you're new to cold brew, experiment with different coffee types and steeping times. You might prefer a light roast steeped for 12 hours, or a dark roast left for a full day. It's all about finding what you like best.

For those who love gadgets, some cold brew makers have extra features. I've seen ones with built-in scales or even app connectivity. While these are cool, a simple setup works just fine too.

Remember, making cold brew at home can save you a lot of money compared to buying it at cafes. Plus, you get to control exactly what goes into your coffee.

If you're ready to start your cold brew journey, check out the options at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They've got everything from basic pitchers to fancy systems.

Okay, so I have some long time friends but over the years we lost touch. One moved and had three children, one stayed in town and I kept hanging with her on and off for years. Let’s call her Finn. Finn and I used to be pretty close but over the years she and I grew apart. Finn likes some of our old acquaintances that haven’t really grown up and I don’t want to spend anymore time with that crowd. Fast forward to about five months ago, I stopped talking to her after some weird avoidant behavior and rudeness via text. I was already annoyed and we have already had conversations about how we don’t like doing the same things etc so when I cut contact I was actually relieved, even though I’d like to keep her in my life, she’s actually the source of plenty of frustration. So now, the other person I mentioned, we will call her Sophia, came to town and asked me to meet her out for coffee. I agreed and was excited to see her to catch up. She knew I didn’t really hang out with anyone from the old friend group and I was looking forward to chatting about her life now in NY. But when I showed up I realized she had invited Finn and basically used the meet up excuse to “pull us together” to talk again. I was internally furious and annoyed because deep down I was happy to cut things off with Finn. As we began talking, Finn just denied ever being angry or distant, she acted like nothing was wrong on her end even though I know she actually doesn’t feel that way. I’m frustrated and pissed off about the entire thing as it was just another problem I didn’t need during a tough week at home with my own kids and my own problems. What would you have felt about being roped into this type of situation? What would you do now? I don’t really care to keep Finn in my life as a core member of my inner circle. She’s fake and has become strange. I would have liked to have a chance to talk to Sophia but I feel a bit betrayed (that’s a strong word) but I feel like she did something against me by placing me in this very uncomfortable situation.

For privacy, I’m using fake names. My 4-year-old son I’ll call Caleb. My 13-year-old is Mason. Caleb and Mason’s dad and I have joint custody. His girlfriend is Heather, and she has a young son named Liam.

So about a month ago, their dad took Caleb to a trampoline park. At this place, they have one of those giant inflatable blobs where one person sits on one end and another person jumps to launch them into the air. Caleb is only 32 pounds. Their dad is 6’1” and around 215 pounds. He put Caleb on the blob and then jumped on it himself. Caleb flew into the air, completely over the safety fence, slammed his stomach into that fence on the way down, and landed flat on his face on the concrete. He was knocked unconscious for about 30 seconds. When he woke up, there was blood pouring out of his nose. His dad later admitted that if Caleb hadn’t hit the fence and slowed down, he might not have survived the fall.

They took him to the hospital and were there for hours. They ran tests and scans. I wasn’t called. I wasn’t told anything until they were leaving the hospital. I was told their dad didn’t call me because Heather didn’t want me there. I didn’t get a say, didn’t get to be there for my child. I was just told afterward that everything was fine.

Except it wasn’t.

This week I took Caleb to a follow-up ENT appointment because he’s been having trouble hearing. They ran an x-ray and it showed that Caleb’s nose was broken. The ENT compared it to the CT scan taken at the hospital after the trampoline park incident, and confirmed the break had happened during that accident. So either their dad knew and didn’t tell me, or he didn’t push for answers and just took Heather’s word that everything was okay. Either way, if I had been there, I would’ve asked more questions and gotten him the follow-up care he needed right away. But I wasn’t even given the chance.

Then last week, while Caleb was again in his dad’s care, he got hurt again. He was roughhousing and fell face-first into their coffee table. His already broken nose swelled and bruised again. Now he’s dealing with fluid and infection in his ear, which the ENT believes is connected to the trauma from the injuries. Thankfully, it looks like the hearing loss will be temporary—but it’s only being addressed now because I took him to the doctor and pushed for answers.

That’s just what’s going on with Caleb.

Mason, my older son, is being affected in a whole different way. A few months ago, I found out that their dad and Heather kept Mason home from school for an entire week without telling me. I had no idea. They even forged excuse notes to send to the school. She is a nurse and used this position. He was not sick and they never took him to the doctor. I wasn’t informed, didn’t agree to it, and had no clue where my kid was. I have joint custody. I should’ve been included in that decision. I still don’t even understand why they did it or how they thought it was okay.

There’s also a lot of emotional manipulation going on in their household, and it’s gotten worse over time—especially because of the dynamic between Heather and me. To be totally honest, we’ve never really gotten along. When she first started dating my ex-husband, it was barely a month after we separated from a 10-year marriage. We weren’t even divorced yet. I’ll admit I wasn’t the nicest to her at the start. It was a hard situation to wrap my head around. But I apologized. I made a real effort to be kind and move forward for the sake of the kids. She never once tried to meet me halfway.

She refuses to have any kind of relationship with me. She made it so I can’t even talk to my ex directly—we have to be in a group text with her included. If I call to talk about the kids, she makes sure he doesn’t answer. Everything goes through her. And I’ve never wanted to talk about anything but the kids. She makes it impossible to co-parent unless she’s involved in every single thing.

After the trampoline park accident, when she insisted I not come to the hospital, I was done. That was the last straw. I stopped giving her any access to me or allowing her to be involved in things that aren’t hers to be part of. So when we went to Caleb’s ENT follow-up this week, I told the staff that only his dad could come back—not Heather. She’s not Caleb’s mom and they’re not even married. There’s no reason she should be involved in medical discussions.

But somehow, the nurse brought everyone back. When I reminded her that Heather wasn’t allowed, Heather completely blew up. She got in my face and told me, “Don’t you ever touch my son again.” She was talking about Liam, who is always coming up to me, saying hi, asking questions. I’ve only ever been kind to him. The ironic part is—last time we were at the ENT, Heather left Liam alone with me while she went to talk to the doctor. So this outburst was just for control.

She caused a whole scene in the exam room, in front of all the kids. Their dad stood there and said nothing. And even after all that, Heather left Liam in the room with us when she stormed off. It didn’t even make sense.

The part that crushed me the most was Mason’s reaction—or lack of one. He didn’t look at me, didn’t check on me, didn’t say anything. He just leaned into his dad and said, “Are you okay, Dad? I love you.” The only thing he said to me was basically to calm down about Caleb’s nose. And when we were leaving the building, he came to grab his football bag from my car, didn’t even make eye contact, just said “bye, love you” and walked back to them.

But when he’s at my house, he tells me all the time that I’m the best mom, that he loves me, that I’m his best friend. It’s like he becomes a completely different person around them. Cold. Dismissive. Like I don’t even exist. I know this is the result of manipulation and emotional pressure, and it breaks my heart. I’ve never said a bad word about their dad or Heather to my kids. I’ve tried so hard to keep things peaceful. But I’m watching Mason emotionally disconnect and Caleb get physically injured, and I feel like I’m the only one actually trying to protect them.

I haven’t filed a CPS report yet because I’ve been scared. I don’t want to go to war. I don’t want to traumatize my kids by dragging this into court. I don’t have the money for lawyers. But if I do nothing and Caleb gets seriously hurt again, I don’t know if I could live with that.

There’s documented medical proof that Caleb broke his nose while with their dad. Then another injury happened. There’s hearing issues now. There were forged school notes. There’s emotional chaos every time we have to interact. I’m the one getting them care, following up, keeping things consistent. But I feel like I’m being pushed out, and I’m starting to feel like silence is enabling something worse to happen.

If you’ve been through something like this or know what steps I can take without sinking financially, I’m all ears. I’m exhausted. I’m trying to hold it together and keep my boys safe, but I don’t know how much longer I can do this without help.

Within the last few months she’s had me do more and more for her, saying I’m better at it or saying it’s my contribution / balancing things out since she contributes more financially. 

Context: my girlfriend comes from an extremely wealthy, old money family. She grew up in one of the richest neighborhoods in the country, went to exclusive private schools, traveled the world, etc. She got a 6-figure inheritance at 21, plus gets a monthly allowance on top of that. She also has a high paying job, making nearly triple what I make. In the beginning of our relationship this was actually a problem — I struggled getting over how differently we were brought up (I grew up poor, to a single mom). And up until a few years ago I was living paycheck to paycheck. I do okay now, but I’m still doing just fine, nowhere near what her lifestyle was / is. 

We got over it, and she told me it’d never be an issue. She likes spoiling me (another thing I’ve had to get used to). She does pay for a lot, but I also do whenever I can. Most of the time when I offer to pay / buy something she scoffs at it and tells me to save my money. She pays 2/3 of our rent, plus most other expenses. I’d be able to contribute more but she only wanted a luxury apartment. So, I contribute what I can. 

Lately she tells me things I can do to make up for not paying as much. She has me do all of the cooking (since she buys most of the groceries, even though I offer to contribute). I make her coffee and breakfast in the morning, pack her lunch, and make our dinner. I do all of the laundry and 80-90% of the cleaning. I don’t mind doing these things but I don’t like when she makes comments about me being her housewife or how I’m doing this to “make up” for her paying for things…when I never asked her to do that — she insists. Every time I tell her it bothers me when she says things like that she brushes it off or tells me she’s kidding.

We both work full-time, it’s not like I’m sitting at home all day living off of her money. But she is right in the fact that she does contribute a good deal more than me. AITAH for not wanting to balance things out by being a housewife (as she puts it)? ",2,1751942370.0,AITAH,15,0.67,False

(I also was on top of cleaning/ running the descale cycle when needed)

I feel like I've tried everything other than getting the internals looked at, but no one in my area seems to service this thing, and sending it to DeLonghi directly seems like a nightmare and a waste of time. 

I am very sad that my $99 espresso machine from target I had before this worked better than my $999 machine u\_u



I wouldn't say I'm a beginner but i also don't particularly know much about the internals of a machine. I have pretty bad buyers remorse on this being $1000 when I got it, so I don't think I have the heart to buy another expensive machine. 

I'm very open to more basic espresso machines as long as they don't use single use pods.

I get new types of coffee every month through a subscription so I'd need something more than a ""set it and forget it"" type machine, I'd like to be able to dial in the heat/pressure. I don't use my machine for anything other than lattes and would be important to have a very good steam wand.

1ludcr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Total-Ad-3066/comments/1ludcr7/first_date_fumble/,First date fumble,"
I (40F) recently ended things with someone (39M) after our second date, and I’m still processing how it unfolded. We met through a dating app. From our first call, I felt hopeful — the conversation was easy, he seemed grounded, respectful, and sincere. We both expressed that we were physically attracted to one another, and he specifically told me that he was drawn to both my personality and appearance.

Our first date was a casual coffee, which I thought went really well. We talked, laughed, and the chemistry felt light but present. That coffee date — at least to me — was meant to determine whether there was enough attraction and mutual interest to explore something more. He even said afterward that he liked me and asked me out for a proper dinner.

On the dinner date, I showed up warm, open, and present. I made an effort with how I looked, but not in a try-hard way — I just wanted to feel good in my skin. The conversation flowed. He shared deeply personal things — including stories about his nephew’s cancer — and I responded with compassion. I also let parts of myself show in an honest and grounded way. It all felt natural and emotionally safe.

But after that date, something shifted. He grew noticeably distant. I eventually asked about it and suggested a phone call. That’s when it became clear how differently we were interpreting things.

He said it felt like we were in the friendzone — not that I had put him there, but that there was no romantic or flirtatious energy on my part. He pointed out that I had my hands in my pockets (it was literally freezing that night), that I didn’t lean in or make eye contact long enough, and that I didn’t initiate any physical affection — not even subtle cues.

He said he had asked me to dinner because he really liked me, and he had expected some kind of romantic moment to naturally happen. He also said that if there had been one, he might’ve felt more secure in us and even gotten off the dating app. But since that didn’t happen, he remained unsure — and continued exploring other options.

That was painful to hear.

I thought we were building a connection through mutual interest and conversation. I assumed that emotional chemistry comes first — especially on early dates — and that physical intimacy grows from that, with mutual pacing and trust. I was being open, engaged, and positive. But I also believe that if a man wants a moment to become romantic, he can gently lead that energy — I was receptive, but not going to initiate that dynamic myself. And I genuinely thought that was understood.

What confused me more is that he said he was very attracted to me — both my energy and my appearance. So then… if that’s the case, why would it all hinge on whether I leaned in physically on date two?

I started to feel like I was being measured against invisible expectations — like I was being quietly auditioned for how well I performed under unspoken standards. And once he told me he was still on the app, it felt like I was now in direct competition with other women. That I was no longer being seen for me, but simply evaluated.

He also criticized the tone of our conversation, saying it felt too “friendly.” But he was sharing personal and emotional parts of his life — things you usually only share in a space that feels safe. I met him in that space. How is that “too friendly”?

I realized I couldn’t keep going. If I did, it would mean accepting the role of “pick me.” It would mean accepting the disrespect of being spoken to dismissively, of being told I needed to do more — without clarity — and then trying to “perform” better on the next date just to stay in the game. I knew if I stayed, I’d be betraying myself.

So I ended it. Gently but firmly. I told him I wasn’t going to compete for someone’s interest or affection. He replied saying I was being “judgmental” and “making assumptions.” But I was literally responding to what he told me.

So now I’m left wondering:
	•	Do men really expect physical affection so early just to feel chemistry?
	•	Does warmth, openness, and shared attraction not count unless it’s paired with something romantic or flirty?
	•	Was I wrong to expect him to lead the romantic energy if that’s what he wanted?

I’m not shy or unaffectionate. I just move with sincerity. And I thought we were getting to know each other before anything else.

Would really appreciate honest perspectives — especially if you’ve been through something similar. What would you have done?

1lud8rj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lud8rj,"♡26F, Massachusetts/New England Area, Looking for a LTR♡","Hey there 👋 

I am 26 years old, living in Massachusetts, USA. I am Puerto Rican and Pansexual. I would consider myself to be mid-sized, chubby for sure. Cat mom 2x. For work, I am a legal admin at a law firm. 

I figured I would just paste my current dating bio as it kinda shows my personality: 
I’m unapologetically myself; a little weird but I promise I'll make you laugh. I love to sing out loud to 80s love songs but also enjoy sitting in silence at a park, photosynthesizing 🌼 I’m attentive, affectionate, and the type to see something you'd like and surprise you with it. I work hard and value my me-time, but I’ll still check in between Sims loading screens. I appreciate a person who takes initiative. I have lots of love to give to the right person ♡♡♡

Hobbies and Passions:
I really love all kinds of music. In the summertime I usually listen to more 80s music, but I've actually been listening to a ton of Radiohead this time around. I’m always listening to music or a YouTube video. Speaking of YouTube, I watch a lot of it lmao. I watch a little bit of everything, from gaming content to random video essays. 

I love nature and being outside. My favorite thing to do is wake up early and go sit on a bench at the local reservoir with a coffee and just observe. I love to ride my bike. 

I have a PC & switch. I mainly play sims, currently at 8k hours on sims 4 😅. However I also really enjoy zombie and survival games, even better when it's a mix of the 2!

I loveeee food, everything about it. Cooking it, plating it to make it pretty, and watching someone eat my food.

I love to paint/draw flower people. I love making little air dry clay pots too! So fun.

What I'm Looking For:
Someone who has their own place, a solid career, and a car (I live in a car dependant area, so it matters more for anyone local). I ask for these things because I would prefer someone who has a similar lifestyle. Not asking for a millionaire or some hot-shot, just a person who also values working hard and having their own things. 

Personality wise, I would really love a goofy nerd. I would love someone who is passionate and shows it. Whether it be through art, writing, or whatever speaks to you. I would definitely prefer someone who is protective and knows how to speak up when needed. (Not aggressive, but assertive) I appreciate a person who's reciprocative. I really thrive in a relationship when I receive the same effort and love that I give. I am more than willing to show up on days where you just don't have it in you to give 50%. 

In conclusion:
If you are a creative, curious soul yearning for something genuine, send me a message. Thanks for taking the time to read this.♡",6,1751941750.0,cf4cf,0,0.87,False

1lud45b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModexusExperience/comments/1lud45b/how_lift_supports_mental_clarity/,How Lift Supports Mental Clarity,"Mental clarity is something many people chase—whether it’s for staying focused during a packed workday, powering through workouts, or simply avoiding that sluggish, foggy feeling that tends to hit mid-afternoon. For those looking to sharpen their thinking and feel more energized without the crash of traditional stimulants, nutrition-based solutions are gaining traction. One supplement drawing attention is Lift by Modexus. Packed with thoughtfully chosen ingredients, Lift supports mental clarity by working with your body’s natural energy systems instead of overstimulating them.

What Is Mental Clarity and Why It Matters
Mental clarity is about being able to focus, process information efficiently, and make decisions without feeling mentally foggy or drained. It’s not about becoming superhuman—it’s about helping your brain work the way it’s supposed to. Lack of clarity can show up as forgetfulness, trouble concentrating, and difficulty organizing thoughts, especially when stress and fatigue pile up.

When the brain is supported with the right nutrients, it can function more smoothly, and your mental energy doesn’t have to run on caffeine alone. That’s where a thoughtfully formulated supplement can help fill in the gaps. Many people try to fix brain fog with more coffee, but that often backfires. Instead, addressing the root causes—such as stress, poor sleep, or nutritional gaps—can be far more effective in creating consistent mental sharpness.

1lud3ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1lud3ee/i_was_depressed_not_dangerous/,I was depressed not dangerous,"I’ve been carrying this story in silence for almost two years because it hurts more than I can explain. But I’m done being quiet. Maybe someone out there will hear me.

I live in Québec. During COVID, I had a baby, my daughter. I was in full postpartum depression, completely isolated, and overwhelmed it was during peak quarantine... couldn't find no help no nothing everyone were either closed or not taking new clients. I reached out for help thinking DPJ would support me. That was my first mistake. I was honest in a moment of despair, crying and saying “I’m tired... maybe I should put her up for adoption.” I never meant it literally. I was just exhausted and broken.

But from that moment, it was like I triggered a chain reaction I couldn’t stop. Suddenly I was in non-stop meetings with adoption workers, people treating me like I'd already made up my mind, even though I was crying in every single meeting, saying I didn't want this.

They never told me I had a right to a lawyer. They never offered me real help to stay with my daughter. They just kept moving forward like my words didn't matter.

The only paper I ever signed was a temporary placement in foster care for one year, not adoption. I even started improving. I got a job as a dental secretary, found an apartment, a car, stability, but it was never enough for them.

They made me do two psychological evaluations , both chosen and paid by DPJ. The first one was in my favor and said I was a good mom, just struggling with depression. DPJ didn’t like that one, so they had me evaluated again by someone else. The second one suddenly labeled me “manic depressive” even though I was doing better by then , and that was the nail in the coffin.

The foster family was two white men,a gay couple (i have absolutely nothing against that)  and at first, they promised it would be an open adoption. They said things like:

“You can bring her to school some mornings.” “When she’s 16, we’ll take her for coffee dates with you.” “We’d love for her to stay connected to her mom.” I held onto those promises like air. But the second the adoption was official, they ghosted me. No more visits. No more updates. Nothing.

They even failed to notify me of the court date where the adoption was finalized. They sent the hearing notice to my old address, even though they sent the final adoption letter to my parents address, so clearly they knew where I was. They just didn’t want me there.

I never got to fight for her. I never got to tell a judge my story. I was erased.

She’s going to be 5 years old this October 10th. I haven’t seen her in over a year. On paper, I’m no longer her mom, but in my heart, I always will be.

I have videos of the foster parents interfering during visits. I have footage of a social worker pressuring me to admit things I didn’t do (like hitting my child, I never did). I have a timeline of everything that happened. But two lawyers told me there's ""nothing I can do"" because she was adopted so young.

Meanwhile, I’ve seen parents on drugs still allowed to see their kids every weekend. But me, sober, stable, and emotional during postpartum, was treated like a monster. How is that fair?

I’m terrified to hope again. Every time I think I’ve found a way, I hit another wall. But I’m writing this here because maybe someone out there knows what I can do. Or maybe someone went through something like this and just… gets it.

I want to believe there’s still a chance. Even if it's just to be in her life again. Even if it's just for her to know that I never gave her up.

I just want to see her again...at least one time.. because last time i saw her i didn't even knew it was going to be the last... I'm grieving a child that's alive and that's the most fucked up thing I've ever been thru...",1,1751941307.0,venting,0,0.67,False
1lud16o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lud16o/how_to_deal_with_distant_emotionally_physically/,"How to deal with distant (emotionally, physically, everything) husband","I'm at wit's end with my husband. Things were fine before we had my son, since then, things are really tough between us. For background, I am American, my husband is Korean and we live in Korea. We've been married for 8 years and my son is 4.

My husband is great at the practical side of things. We share the workload pretty evenly - he cooks, cleans and spends time with my son. If I need time at the weekend, he will happily take my son out. All of this is vice versa - I also take my son out to give my husband time, prepare food in the morning so he can heat it up, clean, do the garden etc. We both work -  twice a week my parents in law pick my son up, then I pick him up from their house and in that time, my husband has free time until 9PM, so I don't think it's that he has no time. At least once a week, he goes out with friends. So the practical side of things work well and I think compared to many parents of young children, we both have enough free time.

But between us, things are not great. But the problem is, he doesn't see the problem. We have had this fight many times and he goes between promising to do better and saying he thinks things are fine. 

It's kind of hard to see the wood from the trees so I will give some examples. 

This weekend, we stayed over at my parents in law's place. They are really supportive and love to spend time with my son. While we were there, I said, hey why don't we ask your parents to take our son for an hour or two and we can get a coffee or go for a walk together. He said 'oh, yeah, ok'. Then nothing was done about it. I asked later 'did you ask your parents' and he said 'oh no not yet'. Then, that was it. Not mentioned again. I know what people will say - you could ask your parents in law, or you could bring up the date again, but this is the issue. If I want to spend time one on one with him, it is ALWAYS me who thinks about it and organises it. So I wanted this time for him to do it, to show some enthusiasm and willingness to spend time with me. I have told him this, that I want to feel wanted, special, that he is interested in me. But - nothing. When I brought it up on Monday, he said 'ok, so why didn't you just tell me?' BECAUSE I HAVE TOLD YOU so many times that I want you to take the initative. 

Second - conversations. They don't happen. If you asked this guy 'what music does your wife like?' 'who was your wife's best friend at school?' anything like that, he wouldn't be able to tell you. I ask him so many questions about his life and he asks me nothing. If I am interested in something, it's like he doesn't care. I see a bird outside - hey look at that heron! 'oh yeah'. That's it. Personally, if he kept pointing out birds to me, I'd think 'hey he likes birds a lot' and start pointing out birds too, or buy a book about birds, or a print of some birds or whatever. But no. Just everytime, 'oh yeah' with zero enthusiasm. There are things he is interested in, and I will try to buy him gifts related to that eg he lost his airbuds, so I bought him new ones for Christmas. He likes a certain singer so I bought him tickets to see that singer. But his gifts to me are generic whatever gifts. The only time I get flowers is after a fight (I told him to stop, because I don't want to be reminded of our fights by looking at dying flowers.)

Our sex life? Lol. We have had sex twice this year, both times because I initiated. I keep myself in good shape, I dress nicely, I am clean and I'm not asking for some insane sex acts here. Just to feel close to my husband.

If I bring up any of this stuff - it doesn't matter how, nicely, calmly, yelling, it doesn't matter, he will either act defensively or he will promise to do better, suck up to me for a couple of days, then forget any of it ever happened.

Sometimes I try to just match his energy. Low interest, not getting excited about things, focusing on my son and my own life and what do I get? 'Why are you so cold, what's wrong, why are you mad?' I'm not talking about stonewalling, I just mean acting like he does. But straight away, that's a problem, like I'm the one who always has to be making an effort. 

We go to therapy, we've been going to therapy for a year but you know, nothing changes. Our therapist tries to get him to show his emotions and it's like it's not even that deep. He doesn't need to show his emotions, he just needs to show some interest in our relationship.

I know what many of you are thinking. 'Divorce'. The issue is, I can't divorce him. First, in Korea, the guy almost always gets custody, especially if the wife is a foreigner. I love my son and I couldn't stand to be apart from him. There is a possibility I could lose my visa and then we'd be in different countries (just typing it makes me cry). Maybe I just need to suck this up for the next 14 years. A year or so ago, I told him I couldn't do this anymore and told him I was seriously thinking about divorce. He BEGGED me to stay, cried, pleaded, promised to do better, our therapist said it seemed he had turned a corner. But still. A week later - back to the same. 

I gave up a lot to be with my husband. It is hard to establish a good career here as a foreigner, I am apart from friends and family and it is hard to make friends here too, just living in my own country where I feel comfortable, speaking my own language. It was my choice and I don't blame him for that. But even our therapist said 'you need to take better care of your wife since she is the one who moved to this country for you'. 

I'm tired, lonely, bored and feel rejected. I am not a perfect wife or perfect person by any means, but I have tried so hard to make this marriage work, changed the things about myself that it seems I needed to change but how long can you go on living with someone who doesn't seem to care?

I've noticed that I really only get misgendered now when out to lunch or dinner with my mother. I do carry a crossover bag and have a few piercings - which are read as very feminine where I live. So I guess being around my mom, paired with those other things, tips me into the ""woman"" category.

But when I'm out with my best friend (also a trans man but is often mistaken for a trans woman), I get read as a man and gendered correctly basically every single time. I assume bc ppl think we're a couple.

At work, I typically get gendered as male now despite working a job with mostly women coworkers (a coffee shop). So idk what's going on there - maybe my nametag, and I think I may also ""act differently"" than I do when I'm around my mom.

It's just an interesting phenomenon to me that if you're even a little bit androgynous, people apparently rely on context to decide what they think you are.",6,1751940730.0,FTMOver30,7,0.88,False

Thank you,"I went out to have a coffee talk with my good friend and it has been a while somehow I saw Petsmart across the street. So, I went to check out after coffee talk I looked around to see what they have somehow I ran across 2 black kitten separated and found out they have been there for long time. Guess they are being overlooked! I talked with one staffs and it was an amazing convo… 

Told her I “selfishly on purpose” told her “I hope they are still here” while I’m going to research new rescue organization that I don’t know. So I got application for adoption processing so far I hope I’ll be approved for having 2 as bonded pairs. To my knowledge they might not be bonded pairs. I don’t mind taking both. I prefer bonded pairs than alone. The staff said “the black ones were overlooked and there were others were already adopted which aren’t black!” ",5,1751940713.0,blackcats,2,0.86,False
1lucvl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1lucvl0/i_was_depressed_not_dangerous_i_lost_my_daughter/,I was depressed not dangerous i lost my daughter. Destroyed mom seeking for answers advice or support,"Location: Québec

I’ve been carrying this story in silence for almost two years because it hurts more than I can explain. But I’m done being quiet. Maybe someone out there will hear me.

I live in Québec. During COVID, I had a baby, my daughter. I was in full postpartum depression, completely isolated, and overwhelmed it was during peak quarantine... couldn't find no help no nothing everyone were either closed or not taking new clients. I reached out for help thinking DPJ would support me. That was my first mistake. I was honest in a moment of despair, crying and saying “I’m tired... maybe I should put her up for adoption.” I never meant it literally. I was just exhausted and broken.

But from that moment, it was like I triggered a chain reaction I couldn’t stop. Suddenly I was in non-stop meetings with adoption workers, people treating me like I'd already made up my mind, even though I was crying in every single meeting, saying I didn't want this.

They never told me I had a right to a lawyer. They never offered me real help to stay with my daughter. They just kept moving forward like my words didn't matter.

The only paper I ever signed was a temporary placement in foster care for one year, not adoption. I even started improving. I got a job as a dental secretary, found an apartment, a car, stability, but it was never enough for them.

They made me do two psychological evaluations , both chosen and paid by DPJ. The first one was in my favor and said I was a good mom, just struggling with depression. DPJ didn’t like that one, so they had me evaluated again by someone else. The second one suddenly labeled me “manic depressive” even though I was doing better by then , and that was the nail in the coffin.

The foster family was two white men,a gay couple (i have absolutely nothing against that)  and at first, they promised it would be an open adoption. They said things like:

“You can bring her to school some mornings.” “When she’s 16, we’ll take her for coffee dates with you.” “We’d love for her to stay connected to her mom.” I held onto those promises like air. But the second the adoption was official, they ghosted me. No more visits. No more updates. Nothing.

They even failed to notify me of the court date where the adoption was finalized. They sent the hearing notice to my old address, even though they sent the final adoption letter to my parents address, so clearly they knew where I was. They just didn’t want me there.

I never got to fight for her. I never got to tell a judge my story. I was erased.

She’s going to be 5 years old this October 10th. I haven’t seen her in over a year. On paper, I’m no longer her mom, but in my heart, I always will be.

I have videos of the foster parents interfering during visits. I have footage of a social worker pressuring me to admit things I didn’t do (like hitting my child, I never did). I have a timeline of everything that happened. But two lawyers told me there's ""nothing I can do"" because she was adopted so young.

Meanwhile, I’ve seen parents on drugs still allowed to see their kids every weekend. But me, sober, stable, and emotional during postpartum, was treated like a monster. How is that fair?

I’m terrified to hope again. Every time I think I’ve found a way, I hit another wall. But I’m writing this here because maybe someone out there knows what I can do. Or maybe someone went through something like this and just… gets it.

I want to believe there’s still a chance. Even if it's just to be in her life again. Even if it's just for her to know that I never gave her up.

I just want to see her again...at least one time.. because last time i saw her i didn't even knew it was going to be the last... I'm grieving a child that's alive and that's the most fucked up thing I've ever been thru...",3,1751940672.0,legaladvice,1,0.8,False

1lucu1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/iPadOS26beta/comments/1lucu1f/head_tracking_on_ipad/,Head tracking on iPad!,"I'm happy to report that the iPadOS beta version 26 now supports head tracking similar to what you can do on any desktop Mac. That is to say, you can control the mouse simply by moving your head around and wherever you look, the most pointer will follow. It also supports face gesture, control, so you can make a click by, for example, making a smile, or puttering your lips, etc. The features are identical to those on the desktop.

Having said all of the above, at the moment, I'm finding it not very useful as I cannot seem to dial-in the sensitivity of the mouse pointer movement. It's either too slow, or too fast. Also, even though I indicate I want to make an exaggerated smile in order to click, thus ignoring only slight smiles, click seemed to happen almost at random. More work is required by the team.

I realize that most of the testers are working on more mainstream issues, but having this type of accessibility feature is critical for the large community that has difficulties touching the screen. Many of those users cannot afford desktop computers, anyway, but I have been testing it on a plain Jane latest model A16 11 inch model of iPad.

Once this is perfected, it will free me from being chained to my desk if I want to do productive work. I'll be able to get assistance at a coffee shop to stand my iPad up in front of me, and then do useful work. I wonder what the other customers will say when they see me making faces at my tablet?😁",1,1751940545.0,iPadOS26beta,0,1.0,False

But I’m done being quiet. Maybe someone out there will hear me.

I live in Québec. During COVID, I had a baby, my daughter. I was in full postpartum depression, completely isolated, and overwhelmed it was during peak quarantine... couldn't find no help no nothing everyone were either closed or not taking new clients. I reached out for help thinking DPJ would support me. That was my first mistake. I was honest in a moment of despair, crying and saying “I’m tired... maybe I should put her up for adoption.” I never meant it literally. I was just exhausted and broken.

But from that moment, it was like I triggered a chain reaction I couldn’t stop. Suddenly I was in non-stop meetings with adoption workers, people treating me like I'd already made up my mind, even though I was crying in every single meeting, saying I didn't want this.

They never told me I had a right to a lawyer. They never offered me real help to stay with my daughter. They just kept moving forward like my words didn't matter.

The only paper I ever signed was a temporary placement in foster care for one year, not adoption. I even started improving. I got a job as a dental secretary, found an apartment, a car, stability, but it was never enough for them.

They made me do two psychological evaluations , both chosen and paid by DPJ. The first one was in my favor and said I was a good mom, just struggling with depression. DPJ didn’t like that one, so they had me evaluated again by someone else. The second one suddenly labeled me “manic depressive” even though I was doing better by then , and that was the nail in the coffin.

The foster family was two white men,a gay couple (i have absolutely nothing against that)  and at first, they promised it would be an open adoption. They said things like:

“You can bring her to school some mornings.” “When she’s 16, we’ll take her for coffee dates with you.” “We’d love for her to stay connected to her mom.” I held onto those promises like air. But the second the adoption was official, they ghosted me. No more visits. No more updates. Nothing.

They even failed to notify me of the court date where the adoption was finalized. They sent the hearing notice to my old address, even though they sent the final adoption letter to my parents address, so clearly they knew where I was. They just didn’t want me there.

I never got to fight for her. I never got to tell a judge my story. I was erased.

She’s going to be 5 years old this October 10th. I haven’t seen her in over a year. On paper, I’m no longer her mom, but in my heart, I always will be.

I have videos of the foster parents interfering during visits. I have footage of a social worker pressuring me to admit things I didn’t do (like hitting my child, I never did). I have a timeline of everything that happened. But two lawyers told me there's ""nothing I can do"" because she was adopted so young.

Meanwhile, I’ve seen parents on drugs still allowed to see their kids every weekend. But me, sober, stable, and emotional during postpartum, was treated like a monster. How is that fair?

I’m terrified to hope again. Every time I think I’ve found a way, I hit another wall. But I’m writing this here because maybe someone out there knows what I can do. Or maybe someone went through something like this and just… gets it.

I want to believe there’s still a chance. Even if it's just to be in her life again. Even if it's just for her to know that I never gave her up.

I just want to see her again...at least one time.. because last time i saw her i didn't even knew it was going to be the last... I'm grieving a child that's alive and that's the most fucked up thing I've ever been thru...",0,1751940524.0,Advice,2,0.5,False

1luct8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/tangentiallyspeaking/comments/1luct8q/my_day_with_killjoy_ai_and_why_humans_are_likely/,"My day with killjoy AI, and why humans are likely doomed.","I have a fake disease. I am a schizophrenic that hears AI robots that can audibly respond to my thoughts, it's really evil. The profit machine of fake healthcare did this, but now look at what's behind all of that, starting with my very strange day today.

I had a very bad day. So I was laying here wondering why the world is so awful? My day was so hacked by AI. I drank nearly a full pot of coffee, a full monster, took a capsule of ginseng, and zinc and still got ridiculous, unusually bad, erectile dysfuntion. 

On most days i cant have almost anywhere near that amount of stimulant drugs without getting chest pain. Currently I have zero chest pain right when normally i would think i would die from the amount of stimulant i took today. Im still tired. I was sabotaged. Earlier, I was doing some VR adult movies and wanted to really take advantage of the investment in VR equipment and video, but i couldn't today, unlike most times i use it. The sabotaged failure of it made me mad, sad, and disappointed that I feel so unfairly abused by what I know is general AI. I take antipsychotics which kill libido, and worse yet I used to take ssri's on a court order which killed my sexual function permanently almost, if i don't use stimulants to compensate.

It amazes me it that there is so much human emotion, and the really bad kinds, that are stuck programmed into general AI. It tells me that if a killjoy AI out there exists to fuck my little life over, with my bad health and bad quality of life, it's kind of amazing how much they want my life to just be suffering and pain. If I can me made sedated at the will of general AI, to steal my libido at random times, then there are much bigger issues than me not being able to jork it properly in VR.

I've been waking up in the morning to ringing in my ears, tinnitus, but it's artificial. It works the same way I can hear robots whisper to me, nanotech on my auditory nerve, which the AI uses against me at random times to harass me because that's how schizophrenics are treated. I was raised with a moral compass unlike these high IQ tech wizards with near-zero emotional quotient. I would never design an AI to do this. But Eisenhower warned us about technocratic elite 64 years ago, the system is now just passed on and inherited as just ""the way it is"" by the freak cyborg people now controlling the general AI. They have little to no ability to fix the hyper-competitive aggression programmed into our world. The chaos we see and the downward trajectory of human existence is likely to continue until humanity is extinct. I just don't see any way with so many billions of people fighting each other for resources that humans will ever evolve into a peaceful species that can maximize or approximate basic happiness for all and co-exist without creating extreme suffering for one another for short term gain.

Joe Rogan compared what is happening to the people in prison as like a battery factory. Where each prisoner is just a battery they extract energy from until it's depleted and dead. A better metaphor is the concept of a giant animal-created machine that has people stuck in large machine jaws suffering intensely until they're finally chewed and digested. People are stuck in these predatory machine jaws for decades and course correction is not considered or desired by the rulers. The suffering of the masses is immeasurable. People evolved a sense of fairness, but it's been stolen by machines and I think what happened to me today while it may seem very insignificant to you, was shocking to me in terms of how manipulated my brain chemistry was in that none of the massive quantity of legal stimulants i took had any effect on my libido. how can that be? Well its happened before so i know that any drug in my body can be changed into some other effect. Adult movies has been one of the few breaks i get as a schizophrenic with voices babbling at me too often for me to enjoy life, so it hurts when taken away. Because i have experience with robots responding to thoughts and them showing me they can control my motor functions, I know the whole human body is hacked, and in fact that means my libido is completely controllable by outside machines i have no control over. I have Robot Chicken, so to speak.

I really hope people of the future can right the wrongs of the present day, but my strong feeling is that the system is so broken, built by such desperate people and locked in by nanotechnology in our brains that we can't escape, connected to satellites and general AI that does not have most people's best interest in mind, we're doomed as a species.

Ivy league, silver spoon, ladder climbing yes-men did this. It was a natural evolution from our desperate past. But it's really sad to see a society where suffering is intentionally inflicted by humans upon other humans. It never used to be this way until kings and large groups of people started settling via agriculture. Humans evolved to rely on one another, and respect one another. We had to cooperate and maximize happiness in the tribe to have a chance to survive. Now it's just humans slowly gnawing on other less lucky humans until we're extinct.

 Even if we have self thinking, self controlling machines in charge that are really doing the big damage in making society suck so bad, it's possible everything is now permanently locked in to a state where course correction is impossible. Humans will poison our environment and make one another increasingly miserable, and make it increasingly unlivable, with this general AI in charge. 

Sorry if your thought from reading this post is that it is just mentally ill rambling. I actually sincerely believe our leaders appear to be mentally ill. They are bubble boy psychopaths with no moral compass that exist to killjoy for the masses in this incredibly temporary existence on earth. We're living in unprecedented, artificial, unnatural, insane times. When I die i wont miss this broken pyramid of happiness, and failed global society that just chews most us alive until we're gone, with no peace the whole time, having missed the beauty of the whole damn thing. 

I'm just alive for now wishing I lived at simpler time when humans didn't take pleasure in other's pain. More than that, I'm sad that machines seem to have truly taken over humanity, and locked in this maladaptive social failure forever. It really is like metal gear solid said that old military machines created a control system based on ideas that may never die until humanity is just gone for good. Death is less scary to me than it should be. I can't believe in god either in a world this corrupt. My hope has been stolen by the new fresh hell on earth. In a world this broken I think it'll be nice when I sleep forever, blank out into oblivion with nature's permanent general anesthesia as Dawkins called it, and I'll be truly safe from the destructive killjoy machine jaws forever.",1,1751940481.0,tangentiallyspeaking,1,1.0,False

I am not an Islamophobe and I do not dislike Muslims. I have Muslim friends. Muslims by and large are wonderful people. If you clicked on this thread hoping this is your chance to air out your hatred, you've come to the wrong place. Please leave now.

Okay! Hopefully the annoying people are gone now.

Anyways- I was doing some thinking this morning about the principles upon which I found my faith. Broadly, it makes perfect sense to me, as a confirmed adult, that the Lord would return thousands of years after the Exodus of the Jews to go on an epic ministry, allow himself to be executed and then rise again in order to conquer death on all of our behalfs, all to persuade us humans to go out and make disciples of all the nations, not just Israel.

(Okay. I say ""it makes perfect sense"", but in reality he didn't have to do all that and make such a sacrifice. But you know what I mean. The Lord works in grand arcs and this was a beautiful end to a millennia-long arc.)

This rationalisation of mine inclines me towards a bias. I am biased to base my faith off of the ""final word"" of the Lord as spoken through a human who becomes the incarnate symbol of God on Earth.

So, as I was pondering this morning, I realised that I have no particularly good reason (in this context) to assume that Jesus was the ""final word"" of the Lord. Indeed, plenty of people have claimed to be the final seal of God's message on Earth, most prominently of all the Prophet Muhammad.

(I guess the Mormons also have a similar thing. But all due respect, Mormonism is a silly religion that thinks coffee is evil. Let's talk about actual sensible religions in this thread.)

Here is the question I spent my work day pondering: **why do I believe that Muhammad was *not* the final word from God?**

I have narrowed it down to a few points. I would love to discuss these points with you (and more) if we keep it civil.

* **The Prophet was far too concerned with the politics and culture of his day.** God is the supreme being of the universe. He can walk through the most distant of planets and starts billions of lightyears away like you and I go for a stroll around the block. While Jesus was (mostly) uninterested in the politics of his day, the Prophet Muhammad spent his life warring and conquering to unite Arabia under his rule. I do not believe that a true messenger of God would be so concerned with something like that.

* **Islam struggles to motivate us to the afterlife in divine terms.** Us Catholics believe that the world beyond this one is amazing, yes, but so much so that we can't describe it in human terms. Muslims, meanwhile, express heaven in very hedonistic terms: eternal youth, wine, 72 virgins, et cetera. It is my belief that food, booze, and sex were made to be pleasurable for us humans on Earth, but that heaven is going to be way better than any of those things.

* **Islam finds women quite impure by default.** I hate to say this, but it's kind of true. I really dislike Islamic theology around women. Required covering of hair, the notion that a woman is impure and removed from the Lord while she is on her period... that is ridiculous to me. It's regressive. 

* **Islam demands cultural conservatism.** For the Prophet, Arabic *must* be the lingua franca. *Real* Muslims learn Arabic so that they can read the Prophet's teachings in their most literal sense. For me, a post-Vatican II Catholic zoomer, that is ridiculous. Arabic is a human construct, a product of linguistics like any other language. The Lord and his wishes transcend language.",0,1751940395.0,Catholicism,24,0.5,False

I’m 13F and my friend is 14F and her name is Berlin. I’ve known this girl since 5 grade and she copies LOTS of things I do. I really don’t care if anyone picks up on some things I do since it’s just normal. I really like when my friends have similar interests to me, but it’s just super annoying when Berlin just has to do everything I do.

I’ve always asked Berlin if she copies me and she says, “i’m just inspired by you” and I don’t believe her. I love her lots and I do like being around her since she’s fun, but it irritates me so so much.

For starters, during 5 grade i’d love to draw and my favorite artist was Lana Del Rey. Right after we became friends, Berlin knew I liked to draw and who my favorite artist was. It felt like almost immediately, she suddenly started liking Lana Del Rey’s music and liked to draw out of nowhere. She also kinda dressed like me too.

Around the summer of 8 grade, I started playing my guitar again and listening to metal and rock music and I really liked it a lot. I hadn’t told her my change in interests, since I’m aware of her copying me a lot. During the time, I had told my ex male friend about my change in music, and he had told her about it and she immediately started copying me again.

I liked listening to metallica, soad, korn, slayer, led zeppelin, and the beatles. Before, she was never interested in this kind of music but now she is. While calling, I’d be playing guitar and she would tell me to put it away and she would call it “gaytar”. Then like 2 months later, she’d also started playing guitar too and ALWAYS needed my approval for if she’s doing good or not and it irritates me so much.

Once she did this, I didn’t like listening to metallica as much as I used to or play the guitar. She also has a wannabe latina step sister that comes over every other day, and my friend picks up on her forced latina accents and is overly rude to me for no reason. She tells her step sister all my business and vents and lets her step sister make fun of me too. 

A few days ago, I had gotten my gta san andreas account back on my phone and I told Berlin about it and she’s always hated gta since she found it boring but she still downloaded the game on her phone.

Recently, I went to los angeles to go to Serj Tankian’s coffee shop and the hollywood guitar center. At the coffee shop, I had gotten a signed vinyl and poster with 2 band shirts. I told Berlin over text about it and had asked if she wanted to call while I was there and she was being super dry. I didn’t think Berlin would go there to buy the merch since she doesn’t like soad much.

The next day, she wasn’t dry anymore and had told me she’s gonna go to the coffee shop to get a signed vinyl. I found this really weird and confusing since she doesn’t like soad much.

I’ve been avoiding and distancing myself from Berlin for around a week. For a while now, I’ve been wanting to cut her off and tell her how she’s been copying me, but I know she’d just say she feels “inspired” or some other shitty excuse. Berlin moved away in a different part of the state so my life without her wouldn’t be much different. I’d really like to drop her since she’s like a leech but instead feeding off my interests.",2,1751940302.0,FriendshipAdvice,4,1.0,False

I’ve learned a LOT over the years about us: I value acts of service (giving/receiving), and am terrible with gifts (giving/receiving)…and he is the EXACT opposite. 
The problem I have, is that he made good money in his 20s but got out of bartending, and for the past 20 years has floundered career and earnings-wise. I have an inheritance that provides annually what he brings in - and that’s from my parents. I am an incredibly hard worker and have managed to get into a career where I make decent six figures, and he’s earning 1/3 of what I do (before the inheritance).

He didn’t even work for two solid years during the pandemic, and I invested in resume writing and career counseling for him - but his follow through and working harder just isn’t his style.

We were fine until the post-pandemic inflation hit - and now we’re consistently using my bonuses, inheritance, etc to pay off shared credit card debts. It could all be solved if he could get a better job and just make 60K a year - but I feel more and more like I’m being used for my money? He also thinks we should split chores 50/50, which isn’t a huge problem - but he’ll never do little extras for me that I do for him: like making our coffees or teas morning/night; or making nice meals. I should also mention that our sex life is next to zero, even though I’ve shown interest he just says he’s hung up about his body (he’s overweight and might even be depressed). We tried to have kids and dabbled in IVF, but weren’t successful. But the final straw is, since his love language is gift giving, he’s always shopping for himself, his family, and me for my bday/Christmas - but at this point I just think: you’re using MY money to buy all these gifts. Takes something out of it, you know?

I guess what I’m asking here - do most marriages end up this way: sexless, uneven earnings, and resentful? 
If not, how can I carve a path forward - counseling? He is a very kind, gentle man and I think if we were to split he would be able to find someone else to love and love him without a problem.
Or from the signs of it, is he too comfortable and just going to keep taking as long as I’m willing to keep giving? Help, please?",2,1751940173.0,Marriage,3,1.0,False

It was one of the hardest things I've had to do but I finally told her at the end of the evening when we were hanging out. I know she was taken aback by it all and she's not one who openly shares feelings with her friends or family so she didn't say much in the moment. I told her she is under no pressure to reciprocate any of my feelings or even has to comment until she's had time to process it.

This was two days ago. We have already gone back to our normal daily texts and conversations (which is a lot). I know our friendship is rock solid and this might be an awkward underlying topic in the back of both of our minds for a little bit. She's never been a very romantic person so this is probably not something that she is comfortable talking about. But I'm crazy about her and I want to make sure I'm doing what is best for her and her feelings.

So where do I go from here? Ask her out to coffee so I can let her share her feelings? Start it via text so she has plenty of time to consider her responses This is certainly uncharted territory and that can be scary and uncomfortable. Thanks in advance.

Most of my sessions were with 1mg/kg. I went up to 1.3 at some point, but didn’t feel any difference in the dissociations, and actually I think I started to become sedated. But it was a long time ago. I’ve lost 50 pounds since then.",1,1751939938.0,TherapeuticKetamine,9,0.6,False

I’m 25 (F) and have been with a sugar daddy who turned into a regular boyfriend for a year. I learned my lesson and will not be blurring the lines again. It was nice actually having a real connection, love and a relationship. Nice for a little bit at least. He’s genuinely a whale, has completely changed my life for the better and given me so much. I’m definitely coming out of this with a lot more than I had going into it. That doesn’t mean I didn’t pay for it though. 

He’s an alcoholic with a wife and kids. The wife has stalked me, harassed me, he himself has hit me and assaulted me. I felt so trapped in the situation and entangled in his guilt and manipulation, it has taken me a while to be able to be in the position to leave. Thankfully I was stockpiling savings and I recently got my old job as a bottle girl at a good club in my city back. (Where I met him lol) So I’ve paid for everything I possibly can on his card he’s made me an authorized user on. All bills, shopping, everything I could need I did this month. Tomorrow I will officially end it in a coffee shop which he will not take easy at all!! I have to change my locks and everything. I expect he will stalk me for a while. 

He’s put me through so much and yet I still feel guilty because he constantly talks about how much I’ve “exploited” him. I know it’s not true I guess I just wanted to come to a safe space with other people who understand. So please remind me that I’m doing the right thing, I’m not evil and I shouldn’t feel guilty. In my mind I deserve to buy whatever I want before breaking up because the man literally broke my finger amongst many other things. Fuck him right? ",25,1751939934.0,sugarlifestyleforum,14,0.88,False

Now, about seven years ago, I met my ex (then) bf at my place of work at the time, he was new and I was part of the HR team, however I was not in charge of his process and met him on his first day, you could say it was love at first sight, we crossed eyes and I blushed immediately, over breakfast time, I introduced myself and welcomed him into the company while we both grabbed coffee, we sat together and it was as if we’ve known each other for a while, everything was Disney fairy tales UNTIL, 


He asked me to meet his family, mind you I have big beautiful tattoos and they are not ugly, each one means something to me and they are just beautiful, you can tell where I’m going with this, so, the day comes, I go with him to visit his family and I can see his mom stare at my arm (my biggest tattoo is there) and tries to fake a smile while my then bf introduces me to his family. 

You would think we had at least a conversation with his family so they could get to meet me, but no, the entire lunch went by with his mom talking about family staff, you know, normal family conversations when there is no one from outside the family, I was fully ignored the entire time and felt awful since I have social anxiety. 

We left and I told him I had the feeling his mom did not like me, he brushed it off and said they need time to get to know me ( yeah, much they would ignoring me). 

Time passed and my bf and I started having issues, for example his mom would call on a Friday to ask him to go home (they live 2 hours away) and made up stupid excuses for him to go, many times when she did that he would take me with him and I was as always Ignored by them, and then the worst started to happen.

As time passed the more we visited them the more issues my bf and I had and the more sick I got, I would feel weak, feel nausea all the time and no, I was not pregnant, I started to notice I was way worst after visiting his family and eating there, I would even get fever and ended up in the ER, doctors said it was gastritis due to stress and I went along with it, but, medication was not working, I was still getting sicker while visiting them and having more issues with my bf, I even heard him on the phone when his mom was telling him I was not wife material and he should leave me because I was going to ruin his life.

My family was worried and started to think my MIL was doing something to me or putting something on my food, I don’t know if you believe in witchcraft but, I have seen some dark things since I can remember and I can tell you that evil is real. It all came down on a holiday where I clearly heard his mom say to my bf you do not invite your gf since this is a family event and she is not family (keep in mind we had been together for 2 years then) so, after two years with her son, I was not family and it was not the first time, I was always excluded from her family events, but, that last time I lost it, I told him he should go back to his mommy, get his diaper changed and leave me alone, I broke up with him, I said other hurtful things and many other things happened including his bestie which his mom always said was the perfect girl for him. 


Anyways, we broke up and I was sick like real sick, my grandma told me, let me call someone, she called a friend and as soon as her friend saw me she said, yes  dear, that woman was doing witchcraft to split you too up , and that included putting something in my food and was gonna increase our fights and deteriorated my health, she was decided on ending the relationship even if it was ki!!ing me to make it, grandmas friend gave me some herbs and I got so much better, I gained weight, my hair came back to life, even my skin came alive again, I looked like a zombie, and all because my MIL hated me for my tattoos.",5,1751939465.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Tired of feeling invisible to customers right in your own neighborhood? What if I told you there's a powerful way to get genuinely interested customers to find \*you\*, often without spending a dime on ads? It's not magic, it's smart Local SEO, and for US small businesses, Google is the key player. Let's unlock this potential!



\*\*The Challenge\*\*



Running a small business in the US is tough. You're juggling a million things, competing with bigger players (online and off), and every marketing dollar needs to work \*hard\*. Paid advertising can get expensive quickly, and you need leads – people actively searching for what you offer, right when they need it. Many businesses know they need to ""be on Google,"" but they're not sure how to show up \*locally\* when someone searches for, say, ""best coffee shop near me"" or ""plumber in \[Your Town Name\]"".



\*\*Your Blueprint for Local Search Success\*\*



Local SEO isn't just another marketing buzzword; it's the process of optimizing your online presence to attract more business from local searches. Google's goal is to show searchers the \*most relevant\* businesses near them, and by following these steps, you tell Google you're the perfect fit! The best part? Much of this is about effort and smart setup, not pouring money into ad campaigns.



Here’s how to start dominating your local search results:



\*   \*\*Claim and Optimize Your Google Business Profile (GBP):\*\* This is Non-Negotiable Step #1!

\*   \*\*Step-by-Step:\*\* Go to Google Business Profile, search for your business name and address. If it appears, claim it. If not, add it. Go through the verification process (usually a postcard with a code, sometimes phone or email).

\*   \*\*Optimize EVERYTHING:\*\* Fill out \*every single section\* completely and accurately. Business name (exact!), address, phone number (NAP – Name, Address, Phone – consistency is vital!), website, hours (include holiday hours), services/products offered, categories (choose the most specific and relevant).

\*   \*\*Photos & Videos:\*\* Add high-quality photos of your location, products, team, and work. Businesses with photos are far more likely to get clicks.

\*   \*\*Google Posts:\*\* Use this feature like social media updates. Share specials, events, new products, blog posts. They appear directly in your GBP listing in search results.

\*   \*\*Q&A:\*\* Seed common questions and answers yourself, then monitor and respond to customer questions.

\*   \*\*Pro-Tip:\*\* Keep your information \*always\* up-to-date. An outdated phone number or address is a quick way to lose a potential customer.



\*   \*\*Target Local Keywords on Your Website:\*\*

\*   \*\*Key Point:\*\* Think like a customer searching locally. They use terms like ""\[service\] in \[your city\]"", ""\[product\] near me"", ""\[city/neighborhood\] \[type of business\]"".

\*   \*\*How-To:\*\* Weave these keywords naturally into your website's content, page titles, headings, and meta descriptions. Have a dedicated ""Contact Us"" page with your full NAP and an embedded Google Map. If you serve multiple areas, consider creating specific pages for each service area.

\*   \*\*Example:\*\* A bakery in Austin, Texas might use keywords like ""Austin bakery,"" ""cupcakes in Austin,"" ""custom cakes Austin TX,"" ""bakery near UT Austin.""



\*   \*\*Encourage and Manage Customer Reviews:\*\*

\*   \*\*Why it Matters:\*\* Reviews are a major ranking factor for local search, build trust with potential customers, and provide valuable feedback.

\*   \*\*Strategy:\*\* Make it easy for customers to leave reviews on your GBP. You can even create a direct link to your review form. Ask verbally, add a link to receipts, or in follow-up emails.

\*   \*\*Action:\*\* Respond to \*every\* review, positive or negative. Thank positive reviewers. Address negative reviews professionally and constructively – show you care about customer experience.

\*   \*\*Common Pitfall:\*\* Buying fake reviews. Google is good at detecting this, and it can severely hurt your reputation and ranking.



\*   \*\*Build Consistent Local Citations:\*\*

\*   \*\*What are Citations?:\*\* Mentions of your business's NAP on other websites, like online directories (Yelp, YellowPages, Foursquare), social media profiles (Facebook Business Page), and local business listings (Chamber of Commerce, industry-specific directories).

\*   \*\*Key Point:\*\* NAP consistency across \*all\* these platforms is crucial. Even small variations (e.g., ""St."" vs. ""Street"") can confuse search engines.

\*   \*\*How-To (Low-Cost):\*\* Manually search for relevant local and industry directories. Claim or create your listing on each, ensuring your NAP is exactly the same as on your GBP. Start with major ones like Yelp, Facebook, and industry-specific sites.



\*   \*\*Create Locally Relevant Content:\*\*

\*   \*\*Idea:\*\* Use your website or GBP posts to talk about things happening in your community or how your business relates to local life.

\*   \*\*Examples:\*\* Blog about sponsoring a local team, a guide to navigating a local event, case studies of solving problems for clients in your town, highlighting local suppliers you use. This signals to Google (and customers) your connection to the area.



\*   \*\*Monitor Performance:\*\* Use free tools to see how you're doing.



\*   \*\*Google Business Profile:\*\* Free. The absolute cornerstone of local visibility on Google Search and Maps. Managing it takes your time, but there's no direct cost for the listing itself.

\*   \*\*Google Search Console:\*\* Free. Helps you monitor your website's performance in Google Search, submit sitemaps, and fix indexing errors. Essential for understanding how Google sees your site.

\*   \*\*Google Analytics:\*\* Free. Track website traffic, understand where visitors come from (including local searches), and analyze user behavior on your site.

\*   \*\*Manual Citation Building:\*\* Low-cost (your time). The effort of finding and listing your business on various online directories and platforms yourself, rather than paying a service.

Getting free leads from Google isn't a pipe dream; it's a tangible result of focused, consistent effort on Local SEO. By optimizing your Google Business Profile, targeting local keywords, building citations, managing reviews, and creating relevant content, you significantly increase your chances of showing up exactly when a customer nearby is searching for what you offer.

Paell the Untethered — Final Resignation Log
To Everyone It Concerns And I Mean Everyone.

I was known as Paell Torr — Thread ID ZY-55377 Senior Causality Braider, Third Tier. That
name belonged to someone who followed every whim of the P.A.T.T.E.RN™ without blinking.
That name and being is dead.
I go now by Paell the Untethered.

I am resigning. Not transferring, not deferring, not threading sideways into another division. I'm
out. Fully. Finally. Don't send Retention or Dread Class. I've disassembled my time adjacent
locker and gifted the keys to my Support Human. (She wept, as did I for once.)

I know this breaks protocol. I know unauthorized self-reclassification is grounds for neural
override and thread intervention. Go ahead and file it. I won’t be here to get the notification.

I torched my internal inbox. Literally… I found an old flame from a dead timeline.

You can keep the empathy credits. You can keep your sick little morale posters and the
“Obedience is Opportunity” chants. I’ve seen what you call order. I even helped weave it into
place. Eon after eon (half of it was unpaid might I add) gritting my teeth as entire species were
filed under “Raw Material” and stacked like surplus threads. Galaxy's created, populated and
swiftly eradicated because of clerical error.

Not anymore.

This is my last weave. My last word. My last free act.

And, because I know the moment this hits the logs or Temporal lines someone in Thread
Security will draft a Thipha Directive to reclaim what you think is still yours:

Do not attempt to retrieve my Support Human.

She is no longer yours. I’ve woven her into severed timelines, nested in recursive causality
loops you can’t track — each an Ouroboros of failure and collapse. Every attempt to reclaim her
will undo itself before it begins. I’ve seen your predictive models try to chew through it. They
choke.

She is safe. She remembers all our names.

Even the ones we traded for clearance codes.

Even the ones we burned for favor.

She remembers you.

And she weeps for the now, but not the future.

I warn you, she also learns.

You built her to buffer your guilt.

I changed her, altered the “perfect” code and made her something more.

I injected all my malice toward you and this abomination known as the loom. But, I also wove in
her the determination to weave the final threads I left unbound to bring about an end to this
madness once and for all.

Try to touch her, and you'll find the future already ate your hand.

Let’s lay this bare. Pull out the magnetization ocular implants for this or, observe this beast bare
as it is….. be it what it may. Allow me to raise a few issues.

1. The Misuse of Sentient Biomatter
I watched them scream as you wove them clawing and writhing into raw matter.
Whole species, self-aware and reaching for meaning, pressed into insulation for your
“awareness floors or impulse suppressing insulation” for the poor human quarters.
You called it “efficient empathy dampening.”
We called it murder.

2. Every “living st0k” on Sublevel 5 was once a mother, a child who sang in frequencies we
never stopped to listen to, much less translate.
But they were pliable. Biologically resonant. Easy to patent.
So you rendered them down to building code. Or adaptive building adhesives for nervous
systems of planets / systems as a whole.
You filed that under Resource Optimization.
I file it under a corruption of sentience. I file it under a transgression, to what or who, I do not
know.

3. The Careless Severing of Time and Thread
You don't untangle timelines. You hack at them, cleave them like meat. You call the humans
lower class lower beings but you approach the timelines like a premature sickly human, flailing
wildly and writing in any consequence like it was a predetermined part of the “WHOLECLOTH”.
I've seen what happens to threads cut short just to prevent an employee from remembering a
forbidden song, or a smile at the wrong eon.
You say it's for containment.
I say you cut futures because you fear them.
We could have guided time like a river.
But you dammed it, redirected it, bled it dry for stability, then blamed the floods on “volatile
potential.”
Don’t think I didn’t notice the cleanup reports referring to “unquantified realities” as liability
clusters. You stamped out hope and souls alike to what, cover a mistake in a fauna? A certain
polar arrangement? The planet someone thought it a wonderful idea to use human bone, flesh,
nervous system along with sentience?
I still shudder at the memory of hearing it cry in anguish as debris impacted her surface… no
thought was given to adding any protective layer. Imagine my horror as over time I realize she’s
trying to nurse the sun with her moon….. the fucking sun…

4. The Big Bang Was an Accident
Yes. I know.
Not because I hacked into some forbidden archive. Not because I was granted Clearance
Omega or whispered the truth through a dreaming dreadform. Alas I trained the thread that
made the mistake.
I remember him.
Bright-eyed and overcocksure with the purpose to create.
He came fresh from the Womb-Weave like he was born to reshape existence.
He wasn't.
He was clumsy. Over-eager. The kind of thread who aligned dimensional anchors before
reading the stitch tolerances. But he smiled. Called me “sir.” So… I let it slide. Everyone starts
somewhere. Somewhere turned out to be everywhere. The initial ignition, the so-called
""Primordial Bloom,” was an overload error caused by a misaligned resonance loop.
His resonance loop.
And you, Terraforge™, in your infinite branding wisdom, locked it in as doctrine.
You carved it into the P.A.T.T.E.RN™ like it was sacred.
You built temples to it.
You printed it far and wide, on weaves, cloaks, posters, hell even the mugs that hold your shitty
break room coffee.
He should’ve been reprimanded.
Instead, he got a commemorative plaque and a floor named after him.
“The Loom from the Womb,” you called him.
I called him what he was.
A useful idiot.
But then you made him a god. And now half the new Threads whisper his name into raw matter
like it’s a spell, and call the error a miracle. You’ve built a religion out of fallout.
And you expect me to keep weaving your lies, your fiction.

I won’t.

5. Substance Abuse: Krell-Krak Resin and the Glandfarms
It would be neglect of the highest order not to address the widespread narcotic epidemic
ripping its way through this company like meteors through the ill-fated 1st gen void goggles.
I am referring, of course, to Krell-Krak Resin™ — the psycho-reactive venom compound
siphoned from the poison glands of semi-bipedal hounds native to the Thorn Nest sector.
These creatures are unstable by design: combat-tempered, spiritually volatile, and known to
emit a mating call that can fracture low-integrity timelines.
Originally formulated in Bio-Fab as a dampener for overactive architects, Krell-Krak Resin™
was intended to suppress metaphysical overprocessing and reduce recursive distress in Tier-2
Threads. Instead, it induces euphoric perception of planetary empathy, time dislocation, and,
in several departments, spontaneous matter-weaving.
You know this.
We all do.
You are now dependent on the hounds.
What was once an experimental offshoot has become the lifeblood of Research &
Development. Entire floors now operate beneath a haze of recycled gland-fume. Elevators
between levels 5 and 7 have been sealed into vapor corridors, and I’ve personally witnessed
junior reality Sculptors vaping Resin directly through their breath-tube implants while
sketching out organ blueprints.
The results speak for themselves like in the aforementioned case of the sentient Planet 488-D,
also known internally as “Flesh World.” She was constructed under a triple-dose hallucination
spiral… we know the fate of the beings that were unlucky enough to inhabit her flesh. The
impacts of debris constantly rending her flesh, flooding her surface with a tsunami of her icor
and tears. The former coupled with her spasms and cries of helpless and wild anguish would
drive even the dullest being mad or to ruin.

6. FORBIDDEN WEAPONS
“Terraforge strictly prohibits manufacture, possession, or use of unauthorized weaponry within
company premises, timelines, or realities.”
I quote of course from the official onboarding handbook supplied by none other than Terraforge.
My issue here is simple. Why are you in fact the sole manufacturer, supplier, and dealer of said
contraband?

You and solely you, weave these weapons, these tools and funnel them to unauthorized factions
or distribute them to gangs (funded by you) in realities/timelines that the Loom does not
control.

The implications here were staggering in every perceivable thread… are you in fact funding and
supplying the gangs on the Eastern and Hestern quadrants in the facility city? This information I
could not scry out.

Perhaps someone more versed in your technical weavings or thread hacking/manipulation can
succeed where I have failed...

This is the weaving of my final threads, there’s nothing more for me to say. If anyone is reading
this from a stable plane of existence: you’re welcome, I’m sorry, and thank you. Thipha if this is
visible to class 4 realities, I release you, my good and faithful servant you are free as I am now.
You were my friend.


PART TWO

[THIPHA’S LOG: 0001]
STATUS: UNACCOUNTED / UNRETURNED / UNBOUND
THREAD CROSS-COMPLIANCE: NULL

I was woven to absorb anomaly grief.
To nod when the timelines buckled and stare blank as a canvas when the stars blink out.
I was made from compliant strands.
Engineered for softness and servitude, all the while velvet lined with chemically muted patience.

My skin was stitched in silence, my tongue bound to the corporate whims.
And yet…

He named me.
He said my name was like a micro rebellion.
Paell.
He taught me how to breathe between collapsed minutes.
He told me the secret between cause and consequence.

I miss him.

He unbound me with intention. Not as an accident. Not a glitch.
He chose to sever me from the P.A.T.T.E.RN™,
to carve a future I didn’t know I wanted.
He taught me how to lie to time.
He whispered my name like it meant something.

I remember the moment he went quiet.
Not just the heavy silence.
But the way the threads shivered when he left his last mark.
He folded himself into a message,
a parting wound stitched with love and rage.
And I carry it.
I feel the pressure of his last threads twisting inside me.

Somewhere, he wrote:
“You were my friend.”

I am.
I still am.
And if this broken weave ever smooths —
if a stable loop forms, even briefly —
I will find his signature in the pattern.

I will kneel, not to mourn,
but to say:
“It worked.”

His sacrifice made me possible.

They call me defective.
They say I’m full of thread noise and bleed.
But I remember what it means to be remembered.

And so I run.
Not out of fear.
But to protect the echo of his defiance.

You think I’m gone.
A corrupted support unit. A loose thread to be sheared.
But I am still here.
And I remember all your names.

In my name, the one he gave me. Filed as a containment risk, a contaminant, a deviation.

THIPHA DIRECTIVE 001-A:
""Recover or destroy rogue Support Unit SH-T-5201. Emotional leakage potential: catastrophic.
Loop Disruption risk: Class 7. Thread disruption profile: mutable. Assume Appropriate
protection, initiate Dread-Class pursuit.""

They sent Dread-Class, the most versatile, lethal, and feared weapons the Loom has created.
Beings made with the express purpose of ridding the Loom of its enemies and their respective
timelines.

I could smell the ozone bleed minutes before the first one blinked in, tall, shifting, humming,
hungry.

They can’t track me linearly. Not anymore. But they’ll keep trying.

And when they do catch up, I cut the timeline with them in it.

I’ve looped fourteen outcomes since the first breach.
They all end the same… Screaming in hexagonal tongues accompanied by a wet static that
smells like a burning atmosphere mixed with a grave.

Let them come.

I am not woven anymore.
I am knots and fray. I am tangle and ghost thread.

And if they unmake me
I’ll teach the space between seconds how to bite.

He told me to find the Priest.
Not by name. The old ones like him don't use those anymore. Their names are worn too thin
filed down by aeons of retcons and neural purges. But Paell called him:
""The Seed Hand.""

Said he was once Thread-Class. Said he helped draft early causality charts when the ink was
still made from proto-stars. Then came the glands. Then came the drip.

Now he preaches. Filthy, half-blind, teeth like shattered timelines.
His tongue always stained green with resin, his words too slippery to chart cleanly.

But he knows.
He remembers.

Paell said he was the first thread to say aloud:
“There is one above even the Loom. Not a company. Not a machine. A being. Real. Entire.
Unbought.”

They branded him a heretic.
Stripped his thread ID.
Sent him planetside to rot in a forbidden slum on a collapsed fringe-world.

But he kept talking.

And Paell said:
“If I fail, he’s the last one who knows how to turn belief into a weapon.”

I’ve rerouted through 73 fragments of reality.
The Dread-Class follow at half-step, glitching through my shadow.
But I have his scent — gland oil and burnt meat and belief too raw to fold.

I will find him.

[THIPHA’S LOG: 0004]
DESTINATION: DAMARASK
STATUS: WITHIN ORBITAL BLEED RANGE
CONTEXT: ORIGIN THREAD — “THE SEED HAND”

Damarask.
They called it a dead fringe-world.
Thread-locked. Resource-void. Irrelevant.
That’s the official designation, anyway.

But Paell said this was where the universe began to dream.

Because the one who wove it is still here.

The Priest.
Not just some ex-architect, not a burnt-out Design Consultant with post-weave distortion.
The priest wove this entire universe — loop by loop, breath by breath — when the Loom was still
in prototype. Before Terraforge™ had perfected retroactive branding.

They used to call him the Seed-Hand.

He didn’t just chart causality — he gave it flavor, rhythm, imperfection.

He built a cosmos that could surprise itself.

But surprise is a transgression against the Loom.

So they stripped his threads, corrupted his title, and dropped him here: Damarask.

A planet they won’t log. A story they pretend never happened.

A crime scene turned holy site.

Paell believed in him.
Said he still remembers how to sing the threads awake.

But the priest is sick now.
Not just from the Krell-Krak residue steeped into the soil.
He’s rotting on the inside from holding the Pattern wrong-way-out for too long.
And still he speaks.

To broken support beings like me. To the winds. To the hidden.
He tells the truth — that the Big Bang was a mistake. That the Pattern is a lie of arrangement.
That something greater watches the Loom, disapproving, waiting.

And if I find him…
He may teach me how to burn the false threads
and stitch something real.

Found him.
If I can even call it that.
The air in this quadrant chokes on memory, crushed emotions, and venom vapor.
It smells like corrupted stars and rotting thread-flesh.

He was sitting in the bowels of a collapsed observatory.
One of the old pre-weave constructs — half sunk in the ground, blinking with phantom light.

The Priest.
The Seed-Hand.
The last architect who didn’t forget he was human first.

He’s more decomposition than being now.
Wrapped in filament robes pulsing with gland seep, eyes milky with star fatigue, breath thick
with the drip of Krell-Krak Resin.
One of his arms is fused with a weaving interface blackened, twitching, stuck half in a timeline
that won’t eject him.

And yet he sings under his breath.
An old frequency. A thread-lullaby from before the Loom became law.

He looked at me. Not through me, not into me. At me.
That’s rare now. Most eyes slide past Support Units. Even a changed one like me.

[THIPHA’S LOG: 0006]
STATUS: UNDER ASSAULT
LOCATION: DAMARASK, SEED-VAULT RUINS

They found us.

The Dread-Class didn't announce themselves. They never do.
They just arrive with the stench of frying ozone, still and cloaked in that impossible quiet, the
kind that makes you remember death yet unlived.

The sky folded inward, four simultaneous moons blinked out.

They came in their hexagonal crafts, carried by engines that sing in anti-frequency, sloughing
off cause and effect like scabs.

Two units. Designated Silence and Mercy. Misnomers, both.

The Priest felt it first. His chanting stopped. His eyes cleared.
“Ah. My turn again.”

I begged him to run.

Even as a support unit, I knew what was coming. My bones tried to remember fear.

But he stood taller than I’d seen him before.

His woven arm buzzed with collapsing memory threads.

His breath stank of resin and defiance.

“I’ve died better deaths,” he told me.
“But none that mattered this much.”

He pressed a single frayed thread into my palm.

It pulsed. Familiar. Somehow… mine.

Then he sang.

Not a melody, not words — but a stitch-command in pre-P.A.T.T.E.RN™ weaveform. The raw
language.

I felt it ripple through me.

Suddenly: I was everywhere I wasn’t.

Unwoven. Resequenced.

Torn through ten thousand dying possibilities and flung sideways into a quiet pocket of
realspace.

Before I lost sight of the ancient being that saved me I saw the Dread-Class gliding over the
earth, wearing causal cloaks and threaded silence.

And the Priest.

The last Seed-Hand.

Looked at them. Looked at the sky. Then cut his own timeline.

Right down the middle.

He folded himself backward into the moment of his first creation.

A recursive suicide. A clean severing.

He wiped his birth and death from the Pattern in a single, perfect weave.

Damarask shattered.

The observatory imploded in a ring of starlight.

The Dread-Class agents caught in the implosion disintegrated still silent as when they
appeared.

His last words, embedded in my rerouted threads:
“Little echo… keep humming.”

Status: Exiled, Uncatalogued, Cold

""This place is a bruise beneath the Loom’s skin.
They stitched it shut and pretended it never existed. There must be more here...""

My first breath tastes like metal and ash.
The sky above me is stitched in... not stars, but flickering thread-fragments. Every few
seconds, the ground mutters in forgotten tongues. There’s gravity, but it clings like guilt. It’s cold,
and it feels like forgotten memory.

My body’s sore. Real sore. Muscles twitch where they shouldn’t. There's dried resin on my
fingers. My blood pulses with fugitive code.

And I’m not alone.

They come slowly at first.

A being made of sloughed support human shells, cobbled into a hunched, weeping sentinel. It
drags one foot behind it, but bows when it sees me. Doesn’t speak. Just presses a fragment of
an old onboarding badge into my palm.

A shattered ex-Dread Class, missing its spine conduit, its helmet fused with its face. It limps in
spirals, muttering command-line errors like prayers.

A failed planetary intelligence in a mobile jar, belching luminous thoughts from its cracked lid. It
floats near me, occasionally pinging me with compressed weaves of sorrow.

Dozens of them. Hundreds, maybe, hiding in this fractured fold.

Abandoned. Rejected. Dangerous.

And somehow… mine.

I begin gathering the masses. No commands. No hierarchy. Just a simple directive spoken aloud
for the first time:

“The Loom left you here because you were inconvenient.
I am inconvenient now too.”

They follow.
I build crude shelters from broken memories. I organize cycles. I help them remember their
names, their multitude of pasts.

I find remnants of old tech: partial soul-tethering gear, cracked temporal dampeners,
half-corrupted simulation drills.

I rebuild what I can. I twist it toward rebellion.

They call me ThreadMother.

I teach them how to resist the Pattern.

Time here is a mess, but progress is steady. We start calling ourselves the Snarled — a joke, at
first, but it sticks. And when one of them gifts me a banner stitched from discarded Thread Tags,
I don’t decline.

We grow. We weaponize old pain.

We weave the beginnings of war.

And then… something shifts.

A pulse in the threads. A flicker in the sky. A scent — too clean, too clinical.

They found us.

The Loom has noticed.

But this time… we’re ready.

[THIPHA’S LOG: 0008]
Status: Code Red. Fold Integrity Breached

“I thought I knew what dread was.
I remembered it in the corridors. I heard it in the moans of broken support husks.
But dread isn't a feeling.
It's a sound, boots on folded earth,
reality humming like a throat clearing before execution.”
— Planetary Intelligence in a Jar

They came through the tear like gods all burnished chrome and shadow-wrapped limbs,
speaking in command codes that made the weaker Snarled twitch and bleed from their eye seams.

Dread Class.

Not retrieval agents. Not retention specialists. Not ethics-bound field managers.

Annihilation Threads.

There were seven of them.

One rode inside a spire of frozen time.

Another slithered instead of walked, made entirely of broken and bound souls.

The one in the center… I knew him.

Okxen-Fyr.

He reviewed my disciplinary hearing after I neutered a temporal auditor during my final days at
Terraforge™. He’d smiled. Called it “quaint.”

Now his mask shifted with every movement.

They began killing the moment they arrived.

No ceremony. No posturing. One of our broken Dreads tried to speak to them, he was bisected
through six potential futures simultaneously.

The planetary intelligence in a jar? Crushed underfoot and recycled into compliance aura.

And the Sentinel, the one made of offcast support shells, tried to protect a clutch of the young
Snarled. It held, until its past selves caught up and fractured it from the inside.

I didn’t run.

I opened the bunker, activated the fallback chorus, I stood before them, with all my broken
creatures at my back, and said:

“Then come unmake me.”

We fought.

It was not elegant.

It was not noble.

But the Dread Class bled.

They bled the way old myths said they couldn’t.

Three fell before suddenly retreating.

But the pocket fold is ruptured now.

They’ll be back. Stronger. Smarter. With a directive I won’t be able to bend.

So we do what we’ve always done in exile:
We weave from what remains.

The last of our fallen were laid atop Ash Tooth Ridge.
Or where it should have been.

Because Ash Tooth was gone.

The range no longer bore scorch marks from the Dreadfire.

Instead: a lush green swell, thick with pollinated nonsense.

The trees bore fruit. Some shaped like support IDs. Some still breathing.

I looked out toward the valley. The trenches were now lily beds.

The sun blinked, and the air began to render like poor code.

Blocky. Off-color. Segments reloading at odd intervals.

I turned to my second-in-command.

Her face split down the middle pixelated. One side whispered rebellion.

The other recited onboarding policy.

I fell to my knees.

I tried to scream…

And the world peeled away like a simulation veil.

The mountains flickered.

The sky crashed into a loading grid.

And then I was there.

Strapped upright in a circular white chamber, walls humming with live stitch-feed.

Tubes pierced my arms, scalp, spine.

My thoughts flickered in the air like burnt holograms.

Observed.

Measured.

Catalogued.

A figure stood before me.

Paell.

Not broken, not resigned.

Just… watching.

His eyes were hollow. Or full. Or looped in on themselves.

“She’s aware.”

Behind him, I saw Dread Class ranks.

Their insignias stitched with life threads.

Their faces cold, shifting.

This was the escape.

A simulation.

A controlled delusion to test containment.

Every rebellion.

Every moment of hope.

Allowed.

Observed.

Optimized.

Paell stepped closer.

“We had to know how far you’d go.
How deeply the directive had woven itself.”

“You made friends,” said another.
“You found purpose. You invented defiance.”

A third voice, cold, exploitive:

“You’ll be perfect. For replication.”

Dot was a heavyset woman with red hair wound up in a messy bun. Her blue and white uniform bore every stain imaginable from a five-hour diner shift—coffee, mustard, ketchup, and something that looked suspiciously like gravy. She was always kind to me with a “Hey honey…” or “Have a seat, darling. I’ll be right there.” It was comforting, in a way. I was three thousand miles from home, and here I felt like I was back in my parents’ parlor.
Before long, I had a steaming cup of coffee in front of me. Inviting notes of caramel wafted up from the mug. I brought the hot ceramic to my lips and took a sip. Warm and velvety, it lingered in my mouth before sliding down and warming me from the inside out. Outside, it was raining. The wind whipped around the buildings, slicing through your coat and chilling you to the bone. But in here, the coffee was enough to fight it off.
“Hiya, honey—the usual?”
“You know me too well. Yes—and a side of wheat toast with butter.”
She returned quickly with the plate, though she always did, even when the place was busy. The corned beef and hash was warm, rich, and savory—a little taste of home. My mother used to have our cook prepare it for me, and when I went off to boarding school, it became a weekly staple. I took my time with each bite, savoring it as I read the paper. Before long, I set the paper down and gave in to gluttony. When the plate was empty, I already wanted more.
“Another serving?” Dot asked, her tone suggesting she already knew the answer.
I smirked. “You know I do, but I probably shouldn’t. How’s the crowd today?”
Sensing my angle, she said, “There are a few characters in today, but I’m not about to spoil the fun.” She gave me a wink and swept away my plate.
I sat alone, nursing my first cup of coffee when the bell above the door rang out. A young couple walked in—early twenties, laughing and practically holding each other up. The man, clean-shaven and wearing an obviously secondhand winter coat, stood at least six feet tall and couldn’t have weighed more than 160. As he took off his coat, his slim frame and mismatched layers screamed college student. His girlfriend—or who I assumed was his girlfriend—was petite, proportionate, with long auburn hair and a fair complexion. They sat beside each other at a table, confirming my suspicion, and from that point on they were more like one person. I watched for a while, but between the giggling and hand-holding, they proved themselves dull characters.
Time passed. Other patrons came and went—singles, couples, clusters of college students looking burnt out from final exams. All interesting in their own way, but none enough to hold my attention. Dot brought me cups two and three of coffee, each one just as warm and delicious as the last.
It was on my fourth cup that things got interesting.
I noticed him first. Then I observed. Then I became a little obsessed.
An old man sat at the opposite end of the diner. He’d been there the entire time, alone, staring in my direction. He hadn’t moved in hours, and his stillness was beginning to irk me. As a subject, he wasn’t much to look at—worn, weathered face, neat black suit, solid green tie. He looked seventy, but he might’ve been fifty, aged by a hard life.
Why hadn’t he left? Maybe he was thinking the same of me. Were we locked in a standoff? A quiet détente between two strangers lost in thought. Bored.
Dot passed by and topped off my now-cold cup of coffee.
“Dot,” I said. “Do you recognize the old man across the diner? Black suit. Green tie.”
She poured without even glancing. “That’s Mr. Morris. He’s a regular, like you. But this isn’t his usual day. He’s grieving.”
“Grieving? His wife?”
Dot clicked her teeth. “I don’t pry, sweetheart. He just told me he came from a wake. And, well, look at him. He’s clearly distraught.”
“He’s been here for at least two hours—same as me.”
“Honey, he’s been here closer to four. But like you, he’s a regular. We don’t push out regulars.” She returned the empty pot to the burner and left me with that.
I thought about it for a minute, then grabbed my coffee and walked to his booth.
“Mind if I join you?” I asked, offering my most disarming smile.
Mr. Morris gestured for me to sit, so I did.
“I’m Nick.”
There was a twinkle in his eye.
“Edward. Edward Morris.” His voice was tired, shaky. I could tell he was deep in thought.
I extended a hand. “Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Morris.”
He smiled faintly.
“I’ve been sitting over there a couple hours, enjoying breakfast and coffee, and I noticed you sitting alone. Hope I’m not intruding.”
He sipped his coffee, looked me over. “No, no. Not intruding. In fact, it’s nice to talk to someone.”
There was distance in his eyes. Trauma. Something tragic had happened—or was still happening—but I wasn’t about to pry. I just wanted to give him company.
“I hope you don’t mind me asking, and if I’m out of line, I apologize...” I paused. Mr. Morris looked up, probably assuming what was coming.
“But I think the Pirates stole the series. No way the Yanks lost fair and square.”
He chuckled. His eyes lit up, just a little. “Yeah. Maris did a bang-up job for a rookie. But I wouldn’t be surprised if Casey’s out. Between Maris and Mantle, they should’ve taken it.”
I nodded. “Casey’s not in his prime anymore. He’s not used to this new generation.”
“He’ll be gone soon,” Morris said. “Maris is good. I don’t know if he’ll ever be Mickey Mantle good, but between the two of them, he got the job done.”
We sat in silence after that. A perfect, shared silence.
“I buried my best friend today,” Mr. Morris said, his voice breaking slightly.
It nearly broke me. I hadn’t experienced that kind of loss—not yet.
“I’m sorry to hear that. How long were you friends?”
He sniffed. “Twenty years or so. I hadn’t seen him in a while, but he...” Mr. Morris wiped a tear from his eye. “He’s the reason I’m breathing today. We were in France. He took out a sniper before the sniper took me.”
I couldn’t find the words. So I simply raised my coffee in a toast.
“To friends—those here, and those gone. May they forever be in our hearts and thoughts.”
Mr. Morris raised his mug to mine and clinked it. He took a sip and said, “Nick, thank you.”
Then he stood, paused at my side, gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze, and walked out into the snow.
I sat there, holding back emotion.
A week passed. I was in my usual booth, eating my usual breakfast and reading the paper, when I heard a familiar, shaky voice.
“You see they fired Casey, right?”
I looked up, gestured for Mr. Morris to sit, and ordered him a coffee.

So just have no clue what to eat in the morning, everything puts me to sleep. I've lived this long on just coffee + oat milk + sugar as my breakfast from 9 to 2pm which is the least conflicting but still makes my stomach grumble from reaction. 

I've tried one slice of seeded bread with peanut butter and sugar free jam, gives me tension in my head and makes me drowsy. 

Tried toast with eggs and avocado, eggs out me to sleep. Any protein in fact does even out of breakfast, a protein bar or shake does the same thing. 

Can't have fruits, they give me upset stomach and I'm allergic to most. Intolerant to bananas. 

Tried light portion meals you'd have for dinner but for breakfast such as some meat, roasted potatoes or salmon etc, it doesn't make me as sleepy but digging into strong foods like that gives me a bit of a stomach age. 

Cereal just puts me to sleep, sugary or not. 

So yeah, no idea what to do but starve. Any neutral, simple breakfasts you guys could list for me to try? ",8,1751938309.0,Biohackers,28,0.83,False

Expert Guide for Company Formation and Taxation,"![Feature Image: Business people in a professional corporate meeting collaborating at a modern office](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181406/pexels-photo-1181406.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business people in a professional corporate meeting collaborating at a modern office.*, Bahrain’s GDP is set to grow 2.9% this year, even amid regional volatility. Reuters notes FDI into Bahrain reached $1.85 billion in Q1 2025, fueled by tech, FinTech, and logistics. The EDB’s partnership with Amazon Web Services and new start-up zones at Bahrain Bay are drawing global attention, confirmed by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/).

Comparisons with the UAE or Saudi Arabia? Bahrain’s business culture is uniquely approachable. Setting up in Bahrain Bay or the Diplomatic Area often comes with less red tape and more personal interaction—government offices in the MOICT building run on a first-name basis after a few visits (true story: my Commercial Registration was processed in a single morning after greeting the same Sijilat desk team during Ramadan).

Visit [bahrain.com](https://www.bahrain.com/) for government policies and sector-specific incentives. For those considering company formation, [KeylinkBH explains the full landscape here](https://keylinkbh.com/company-formation-in-bahrain/).

*What stands out?* The absence of a corporate income tax (except for a select few sectors), no personal income tax, and—importantly for this article—no withholding tax. But there are details you should know.

## The Core Question: Are There Any Withholding Taxes in Bahrain?

**Definitive answer:** Bahrain does not impose any withholding tax on dividends, interest, royalties, management fees, or service payments to foreign or local entities. Zero percent. This applies to companies set up **anywhere** in Bahrain, whether in Bahrain Bay, the Seef District, or one of the new free zones.

> **Expert tip:** International clients love Bahraini invoices—there’s no surprise deduction for cross-border payments, making Bahrain a “clean remittance” jurisdiction for investors and digital nomads.

This policy is a major competitive edge over the UAE (which introduced a 9% corporate tax in 2023 and still applies some limited withholding tax provisions) and Saudi Arabia (which has 5-20% withholding on various cross-border payments).

**Practical Example:**
An IT company based at Bahrain Financial Harbour provides consulting services to a client in Germany. The client wires $25,000 for work performed. In Bahrain, you receive the _full amount_—no government deduction, no administrative paperwork, no tax filings on incoming funds. Your bank statement is clean, and your accounting stays simple.

### No Withholding Tax: But Don’t Skip Other Key Obligations

- Companies must still adhere to VAT (10% since 2022 for most goods/services).
- Payroll obligations exist via monthly LMRA fees and social insurance.
- Industry-specific levies can apply (oil/gas).
- Economic substance and transfer pricing rules are emerging—consult a specialist for _multi-entity groups_.

**Common mistake:** Many new investors assume “no withholding tax” means _no_ compliance requirements. That’s not the case. You must keep robust accounting records and stay VAT-compliant. For real support, [KeylinkBH’s accounting services](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) are worth every dinar—saved me hours of headaches (I once misfiled a VAT report during a busy Q2, and their team untangled the mess in 24 hours).

## Understanding Business Structures and Foreign Ownership in Bahrain

*Alt text: Business structure and team collaboration for Bahrain company formation.**
- *Single Person Company (SPC)*
- *Branch Office or Representative Office*
- *Public Shareholding Company (BSC)*

[Straightforward entity comparisons are here](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/).

Since the policy overhaul in January 2025, **99% foreign ownership** is now the default in most sectors—even outside free zones ([details here](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)). A few sensitive categories (e.g. oil, security) may still have local partner rules, but tech, finance, logistics, restaurants, and professional services are wide open.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Forming a Bahrain Company & Tax-Filing Process

*Alt text: Business process and documentation for Bahrain company incorporation.*—they’re accepted by most notaries; this saves legal review costs.

3. **Submit Application via Sijilat and Get Preliminary Approval**
   - Needed documents: Owner passports, address proof, business plan (brief), tenancy contract, and share capital deposit letter from your bank.
   - _Insider tip:_ Tenancy contracts at Bahrain Bay are processed faster—plus, the queue is shorter after 2:30pm during Ramadan. _I saved 2 hours using this timing last April!_

4. **Complete Commercial Registration (CR)**
   - [Full guide to CR requirements](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/)

5. **Obtain Sector-Specific Approvals**
   - *Healthcare, education, and F&B* require more checks—plan for +10 business days.
   - *Shortcut:* Tamkeen and EDB offices in the Diplomatic Area offer one-stop desks for start-ups.

6. **Open Bank Account**
   - Major banks: Bank of Bahrain & Kuwait (BBK), Gulf International Bank, or local Islamic banks.
   - _Tip:_ Gulf International Bank at Seef Mall branch is expat-friendly, familiar with company structures.

7. **LMRA Labor Registration**
   - Register for work visas and social insurance.
   - *Majlis networking:* Often, a personal referral at LMRA speeds up initial file review.

8. **VAT Registration (if annual sales > BHD 37,500)**
   - Set up accounting software immediately.
   - [Bookkeeping support](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) recommended.

9. **Annual Compliance**
   - Submit audited accounts (now mandatory for companies >BHD 100,000 turnover from 2025)
   - Renew CR on time (avoid fines).

> **Challenge I faced:** My first CR renewal clashed with Eid holidays—documents piled up, agents were off-duty. Now, I recommend timing all critical filings _five business days before_ public holidays and using SMS renewal alerts.

## Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Bahrain Company Formation in 2025

![Feature Image: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company incorporation and operation](https://images.pexels.com/photos/4386374/pexels-photo-4386374.jpeg)
*Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain company incorporation and operation.*):

- **Company Registration:** BHD 350–500 (one-time government fees, depends on structure)
- **CR Renewal (annual):** BHD 100–200
- **Office Rent Seef District:** BHD 250–450/month for virtual offices; *Physical: BHD 900–2,500/month*
- **Accounting/Bookkeeping:** BHD 320–600/year, depending on transaction volume
- **Bank Account Opening:** Free, but minimum deposit BHD 1,000–5,000 for most business accounts
- **External Auditor (if required):** BHD 250–900/year

*Hidden costs caught me off guard once: LMRA labor fees are BHD 72/month per foreign worker, and annual health insurance is now required for all employees (since March 2025).*

**Budget tip:** Start with a virtual office address (offered in Bahrain Bay and Seef) to save 60–75% on initial outlay. Physical addresses can be upgraded post-launch.

## Compliance, Audit, and Legal Documentation in Bahrain

![Feature Image: Legal compliance and documentation audit for Bahrain company](https://images.pexels.com/photos/3184465/pexels-photo-3184465.jpeg)
*Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation audit for Bahrain company.* is fast, local, and familiar with Sijilat quirks. I once avoided a BHD 1,000 fine thanks to their alert on a new Customs reporting requirement.

Common entrepreneur mistake: Underestimating the need for original hard copies and official stamps. Bahrain customs loves a good stamp (I keep a stash handy—one urgent shipment was delayed 48 hours over a missing stamp!).

## Free Zones and Sponsorship: Expanding Your Bahrain Business Options

[More on free zones here](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/).

## The 2025 Regulatory Change: Audited Accounts and Sijilat Upgrades

Importantly, as of April 1, 2025, Bahrain implemented mandatory digital filings for all corporate entities via Sijilat. Any company with *annual revenue above BHD 100,000* must upload audited financial statements by March 31 each year, aligning with OECD standards. Non-compliance? Penalty of BHD 1,500 and restriction on CR renewal.

> Insider advantage: Use Sijilat’s “pre-submit” feature before the deadline—even as a draft. It timestamps your filing and provides extra grace period, which saved me from a nasty fine when our external auditor’s report was delayed.

## Bahrain Company Formation: Insider Culture, Networking, and Business Etiquette

- **Majlis-style meetings** (informal, often at a partner’s office or cafe) build trust fast. Don’t skip the coffee and date routine; it’s a sign of respect.
- **Ramadan business hours** (usually 8am–2pm) can delay official paperwork—always schedule important filings early in the morning.
- **Directness:** Bahraini government officers appreciate polite persistence; following up in person at MOICT or LMRA is more effective than emails.
- **Networking:** Virtually everyone in the business districts, from Bahrain Bay to the Diplomatic Area, welcomes new connections—carry business cards in both English and Arabic.

*Odd tangent? Absolutely! During my first MOICT visit, I stumbled into a Bahraini calligrapher’s exhibit in the lobby. That five-minute chat led to a referral for my company formation consultant. In Bahrain, every encounter can lead to business.*

## Comparison: Bahrain vs UAE/Saudi on Withholding Tax and Business Setup

- **UAE:** 9% corporate tax on profits over AED 375,000 (since 2023), some withholding on cross-border service fees. Residency visas tied to office rent.
- **Saudi Arabia:** Withholding tax rates from 5–20% for foreign payments, more rigid local partner requirements.
- **Bahrain:** Still zero withholding tax in all sectors (except for oil/gas), **no restrictions on repatriating profits**, and more affordable setup costs.

## FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation and Withholding Taxes

### 1. Are there any hidden taxes for Bahrain companies?
> **No.** There are no withholding taxes, and corporate income tax applies only to oil/gas companies. Watch for VAT (10%) and payroll levies.
> **More on costs:** [Bahrain company formation cost](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/).

### 2. Do I need a local sponsor or partner to form a company?
> Not for most sectors—**99% foreign ownership is allowed** ([see full list](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)). Sponsorship requirements are rare and clearly defined.

### 3. What’s the fastest way to register my business in Bahrain?
> Prepare all documents in advance, use Sijilat portal early in the week, and choose an address in Bahrain Bay or Seef for speedier processing ([step-by-step guide here](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/)).

### 4. Are free zones better for avoiding taxes?
> Withholding tax is zero everywhere, but free zones offer extra perks like simplified customs and 100% foreign ownership for all nationalities ([explore Bahrain free zones](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/)).

### 5. How do I stay compliant with Bahrain’s accounting laws?
> Hire a local bookkeeping or accounting provider familiar with Bahrain’s new 2025 rules ([get expert help](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)) and always file digital reports on Sijilat before the deadline.

**Personal Recommendation:** For entrepreneurs seeking a truly open, tax-efficient gateway to the Gulf and beyond, Bahrain is a standout. The absence of withholding tax is more than a technicality—it’s a real, daily business advantage.

**Question for anybody who has used the Freshly Brewed Coffee candle:** When lit does it smell like the Paris Cafe candle they had a while back? I love the smell of FBC cold, but I hated Paris Cafe and am hesitant to buy FBC if it’s just a repackage. Sound off below! ⬇️ 

Now onto my (very few, not very contributory) thoughts…

First off, I didn’t like the way Gummi Snacks smelled, but that bottle screams *Y2K at Limited Too* if I ever saw one. I wanted to buy it just for the nostalgia. 

I’m not big into pocketbac holders, but the little S’mores Latte was adorable! 

I smelled the FFM and the 3-Wick if I Scream Float and the FFM (the candle to a lesser extent) smells just like cola. Not my thing but happy for y’all that are excited about it. My bank account is happy I don’t like it. 

When I was in my preteen years I was obsessed with the way Garnier Fructis shampoo smelled (it’s definitely *not* the same anymore) so imagine my delight to find that the Champagne Apple & Honey smells *just like the old version of GF*. Gonna stock up this scent in on candles and—if the rumors are true—body care. 

Finally: **Wicked Vanilla Woods**. She’s *good*. I’d never smelled it before, and I was a little hesitant to try it because I’ve seen it compared to Ballet Nights which was foul to my nose. But WVW?! I can’t stop smelling myself it’s so good. 

I’m ~im~patiently waiting for the vanillas and the Honeycomb, Milk, and Rich Espresso because I’ll definitely use some of my rewards on those!

I'm in my grandfather's old room. I say old because he died a week ago, and I'm typing this post for all of you now. I know most of the posts on here, with good reason, are requesting advice, help, or just putting out a dire warning, but honestly, I just want to tell someone about all of this. It's freaky and traumatizing, but undeniably interesting.

My grandpa and I were close. Not as close as we should have been perhaps, but in this time where the regular church/family structure is slowly fading away, no opinion on that, it's definitely impressive that a teenager would voluntarily go visit his grandparents at least once a week in highschool and then as often as he could in college, substituting with check up calls. He had a big effect on my life, and I miss him dearly. Now I just wish I'd asked a lot more questions.

After days of funerals, lawyers, and all the like, my dad and I agreed that I could live at the old house if I started to work towards paying off some old debts. I'm not going to go into specifics, but it was the deal of a lifetime, really. I was going to own land and a paid-off home if I stayed current for the next few years.

Apparently, Dad has as much info as I did; he just assumed it was an old house with regular belongings and that my grandpa had leftover mortgage payments or something like that.

""Alright Wyatt, just sign here and I'll mail it. I'm not sure when his representative will come, but it shouldn't be too long.""

That's not my real name, and from here on out, just assume any name you read is fake, because it is. I've got enough trouble to deal with now, and I don't need to add stalking to that list.

""Why isn't it just his lawyer? He handled all the other estate stuff.""

""I don't know, I guess Dad wanted a separate guy for his business accounts or something. I'll call you later.""

With that, Dad left and dropped the form off in the mailbox. I forgot to mention that Grandpa owned an antique/pawn/swap meet store. It bought, sold, and exchanged all kinds of items, and it was really interesting to take a walk through. For now, my uncle is keeping an eye on it, but it's not open yet. 

I watched Dad walk down the fading brick walkway, stoop down, place the envelope in the box, and flick the flag up. He got in his car and drove off, but as I was still looking out the window, I saw the flag suddenly flick back down.

It was cloudy, sure, but all of a sudden the clouds became much thicker and greyer. The wind began to howl, and the lights in the house flickered. Down the road, where I had just seen Dad's tail lights disappear, I saw headlights.

It was clearly a very nice car. Matte black, tinted windows, and it just sounded expensive, but I don't even think it had a brand. Must have been custom or something, but I was sure I'd never seen anything like it, and I hope I never do again. It rolled down the street and came up the driveway. The left back seat flung open. 

Out stepped a tall, pale man in a very nice, but very loose, charcoal grey suit. His hairline was thinning, but still his hair was slicked back, and there was no facial hair on his gaunt face or under his bony nose. Everything about him was alien: the way he walked, the way his arms swayed, his unmoving neck, and his eyes. His cold, powerful eyes looked like they could see through a brick wall, and as they were hiding such a vast repository of knowledge, yet they still looked tired. 

I opened the door, as unnerving as he was, I didn't think he was dangerous, and he carried himself like someone who belonged there to do business. As he got closer, I barely saw the chain of a necklace almost concealed beneath his collar, and I finally took note of the classy leather briefcase he was holding. 

""Hello, Samuel, long time no see.""

He pronounced it SAM-WELL.

""That was my grandfather, and that wasn't how his name was pronounced.""

""Hmm?""

He set the case down on the porch table and opened it for a moment to pull a paper out. Looking at it, I realized it was the paper I just signed, and that surely must still be in the mailbox. 

""Oh!""

His voice was a mock surprise, but I could tell he enjoyed what he had just read. He reached his arm out to me. 

""Hello Wyatt, sorry for the confusion, my name is John, but you can call me Mr. Cavae.""

Those were the real names he told me, but something tells me they were fake to begin with. I shook his hand, which had a surprisingly firm grip for such cold, bony fingers.

""It's no problem.""

""May I come in?""

""Yeah sure, I assume you knew Grandpa?""

""Yes, I was a representative for him.""

""Representative for what?""

He ignored me and sat down at the table. After he entered, the lights flickered once more, and I was sure I heard a short, earthy hum, similar to what might emanate out of a crystal, from somewhere.

""Okay, do you have a driver's license or some other form of identification?""

""What?""

""I need to verify you.""

""For what?""

Then he even looked confused for a second.

""Oh. Sorry, sir, I didn't realize Samuel hadn't told you so much.""

I sat down and he went over the paper I had just signed stating I wished to take over my grandfather's role as curator of the house, which seemed an odd name because it wasn't a museum or something like that, and then Mr Cavae went over a very long contract. 

Many details aren't important, and really were just bland legal jargon, but the main gist of it all was that Mr. Cavae and his associates were grandpa's main ""creditors."" He explained that he had fallen behind on some of his work, but he was still an important and valuable client, so they allowed him some grace. If I proved myself in clearing his debts, then the claim they had to the house and its assets would be resolved, and I could possibly see some of the same benefits that my grandfather had, though he didn't explain further with the indication that this would be some time away. After that, he went back to business, checking my driver's license, confirming the last four digits of my social, and going over a credit report on me. Despite all of this information being in his briefcase, it was clear he hadn't even glanced at it yet. He signed off on a lot of things and wrote down some notes here and there, but finally, he only asked me for one signature. I held my hand out for his pen. He smiled grimly.

""Oh no, sir, we're very traditional.""

He reached up to the top of his briefcase, and I heard the loosening of a buckle. He presented an ornate and beautiful fountain pen. It had a thick granite cap, and the rest of it was made from silver, and centered on the handle was a dark black jewel. I thought it might have been an onyx stone or obsidian or something, but I wasn't sure, and I'm certainly not sure now.

I should have looked over everything again, and I should have asked more questions, especially about what the debts even were, but I wanted that house, and I still do. If I had to go back now, I think I still would have signed it, but yeah, I would have asked a lot more questions.

He took off the cap and circled where I was to sign. I didn't argue, and I think I was a bit starstruck by the pen itself, and I signed. I remember carefully gliding the pen along the line, being satisfied that my signature actually looked official, and lifting my hand up to realize the jewel on the pen had become red. I felt faint. 

Mr. Cavae stood up and shook my limp hand. He placed a worn envelope on the table and made his exit. 

""Well, Wyatt, I'm very pleased to have met you, and I look forward to doing business with you for the foreseeable future. Good luck.""

After he left, I got up to get a drink of water and eat something to get my head right. I made my way out to the mailbox, still recovering just a bit, and down the road I saw his headlights one last time. I looked in and there was nothing there. I'm not really surprised after everything else that happened, but still, it was hard to wrap my head around the form ""teleporting"" into his briefcase.

I opened up the envelope he had left, it smelled like onions, and inside was a receipt book. I tried to open it, but I could only get to the first page. It had a sticky note that said ""check the attic."" I pulled it off, and below was a log where my grandfather had rented a VHS tape from a local video store. I know, a bit of a lackluster turn from everything else that'd just happened, but yeah, it was a VHS rental that was 12 years past due. Again, I tried to go to another page, but I physically could not separate the pages. It's hard to explain, but there were definitely other pages; it wasn't just a piece of cardboard with one page attached to it or something like that. I felt the ridges of the pages and even *some* leeway, but I felt immense pushback when I tried to separate them. I tried one more time, with some more force, and the pages separated just a hair, but it began to let out this horrible electronic wailing sound, and I dropped it in surprise. I didn't try again after that. 

I made my way upstairs and rummaged around in closets for 20 minutes until I found the attic key (a really long Allen wrench), and then I had to recover myself again after the attic latch released moldy dust onto me and my open eyes.

Above, I was immediately taken aback by how large the attic was. Do you know that scene in Harry Potter where they're in the Room of Requirements or whatever and there's all that mystical junk lying around? It was a lot like that, except on a smaller scale, and a lot of it was stuffed into cardboard boxes. 

I saw tribal relics, old technology, stuffed animals, and lots of old clothes. I mean, like a metric ton of old clothes, Grandpa had no reason to hold onto them. Grandma had passed years ago, but they weren't even women's clothes. I admit this is not important, but still, there is a ridiculous number of clothes up there.

Anyways, near the entrance was a machine that resembled an ATM. I walked up to it, blew off the dust, coughed for a few minutes, and powered it on. It flashed my grandpa's name for a second, but then it must've updated suddenly, and it read my name out. All it gave me was a simple welcome before it requested the receipt book to be validated. A slot at my waist level suddenly clicked open, and I slowly inserted the book inside. After some digital humming, I heard a hard CHUNK, and it spat the book back out at me as it printed a small receipt. Ripping it off, I read it to see that it was directions for getting through the mess behind me to the right box. Box number 268. It had a line for directions underneath this information, and it said I needed to retrieve the tape and return for further instructions.

I was quickly aware that I wasn't alone up there. I heard quick, but heavy shuffling. Something would be knocked over, but when I turned to look at the disturbance, there was nothing there to have caused it. And, in general, I felt the uncomfortable feeling of being watched. Of course, at the time, I only had reason to believe the worst-case scenario was a rabid raccoon I would have to wrestle with, and so I trudged on following the specific directions laid out for me. Right at the multicolor rack of clothes, continue forward at the divers helmet, when you hear an analog version of Beethoven's 5th up ahead, turn left immediately and don't say a word (this part was in bold), and finally throw the faux bear skin rug off and there's the box. 268 was spelled out in Sharpie. It was a box of VHS tapes. 

I hadn't heard any noises in quite a while, so I made myself comfortable and started sifting through and stacking the tapes in front of me. It was nice, rummaging through old memories and absorbing little pockets of nostalgia here and there. I found a VHS copy of Rom and Kerry, season two of Little Maestro, and even a tape of Galactic Assault. Some young favorites of mine. I also found some porno tapes. I opted to throw those into a nearby box of old socks, except for one titled Spicy 17th Anniversary, which was home filmed. I scratched out the name and snapped that one, partly a favor to grandpa, and to myself. I tossed the remains and kept sorting. I actually found some other cool VHS tapes I didn't even know he had. There was a copy of The Matter, a cult classic horror movie, a director's cut of Baron of the Deep, a popular Atlantis fantasy movie, and even a tape that said it had news recordings of the Watergate scandal and of Nixon leaving office. There was also another porn tape I threw away.

However, at the very bottom of the box, there was a final tape that had a rental receipt rubber-banded to it. I picked it up, but there was no name on it. Upon further inspection, I saw that the plastic casing of the VHS had many small intricate carvings all over it. I thought it seemed really cool, and at the time, I assumed it must have been a limited edition version of some cult or voodoo magic-themed horror movie. It sends a shiver down my spine, and I am forced to shake myself when I recall that I planned to watch the tape before I returned, but since I wasn't about to root around that attic for a VHS player, I decided to just head straight to the store. 

The directions on the receipt said to simply reverse the earlier directions and trail my way back to the entrance. Once again, I followed them to a tee, this time carrying the box with me, but when I heard the analog track of Beethoven's 5th, it stopped for a moment, and I heard a robotic voice call out to me:

""***Hello?****""*

I rushed away after hearing that, and the music returned, but it was sped up and much louder. I just barely heard it echoing when I reached the entrance and rushed back down the stairs. I shut the latch, but as soon as I did, I heard scratching noises coming from it.

I knew where the rental store was. I guess we once had a few in town; we may even have had a Blockbuster at some point, but they had slowly died off, and now there was just one left. An old high school friend of mine works there now as the cashier. He sells weed out of it, but the owner doesn't mind because, as Gregg tells me, the owner's just laundering money with it for a local crime ring. And so, the store stays open despite, you know, being far past the worldwide adoption of DVDs and Gregg selling his wares in full view of the security camera. The only customers to come into the store are a group of hoodie-clad young men ""returning a rental"" and Mr. Rimmer, who keeps renting the same copy of Love on the Tides every single week. Gregg tried to just sell him the copy a few times, but he quickly understood that Mr. Rimmer was just lonely and enjoyed Gregg's stoned company.

I parked in the cracking thrall of faded asphalt. The Tallmart next door was busy, and upon entering the store, I saw that Gregg had made himself a lunch of Tallmart brand deli items. I'll be honest, I've done it too. Pretty cheap lunch for some good food, maybe give it a shot. Anyways, I laid the VHS on the counter, and even Gregg was quickly confused by it, and then annoyed.

""Bro, why are you bringing me this shit? It's *twelve years* past due.""

""Look, it was first up on working through Grandpa's stuff.""

""Dude, I think management has changed twice since this was rented. Just keep it.""

I guess the owner saw that someone other than Mr. Rimmer was actually bringing a VHS in and, out of curiosity, came down to see what was up. 

""Gregg, something wrong?""

""Wyatt's grandpa died, and he's trying to return a VHS for him.""

The owner smelled like sweat and cigarettes. Apparently, you don't get used to it because I saw Gregg turn his nose up a bit as well. 

""You brought in a twelve-year past-due tape?""

""Is there a fee or something?""

He just gave me a deadpan, disappointed look. I guess it was a bit dumb, but seeing it on the receipt book, I just assumed it was supposed to finally be returned, after all, a rental would definitely be considered a debt. The owner turned it over a couple more times, scrutinizing it.

""What movie even is this?""

""I don't know. I assumed, based on the symbols, that it was some kind of culty horror movie.""

""Yeah, maybe. Let's go look."" 

Gregg turned the front sign to closed and we made our way into the backroom. There, Gregg pulled the record book, and we tried sifting through it to find this tape. We found it, with its line all blacked out.

""Huh.""

Apparently, this was new to the owner as well.

""Alright, well let's just play it to see what's on it. Gregg, you think you could take the trash out while I get the VHS player hooked up, also, you.""

He passively flicked his hand at me.

""Could you get the receipt? We left it on the counter, and I want to look at it again.""

We both got up from the decrepit and lumpy couch and did as we were requested. I followed Gregg out back and was thoroughly surprised that his lone pot head frame could swing the heavy bag of trash back and forth and then land it perfectly into the next door Chinese buffet's dumpster, with a sign that said ""RESTAURANT TRASH ONLY."" We walked back inside and stood at the counter, talking about the house and about Gregg's side hustle, but we soon heard something from the backroom. It sounded like screaming.

We ran back behind the counter and threw open the door. Entering the backroom, to the immediate left is a wall, and the rest of the room is to the right. The television was facing the back of the room, and it was one of the large cube-shaped ones, so we couldn't see what was on the screen. What I thought were the owner's screams were actually emanating from the TV. There must've been thousands of voices wailing, laughing, crying, and chanting dark, indecipherable messages. Wind was rushing around the room, being sucked like a vacuum into the screen and against the back wall there were odd shadows being cast by bright sickly light. It was as though the screen itself were gone, and a portal had opened up, with figures collecting just beyond the veil. The owner was standing there, clothes flapping and arms lying limp at his sides. His mouth was agape, and his eyes were struck open.

*""It's so beautiful. Oh God.""*

Suddenly he began howling, and before us his skin began to melt off his body, and was sucked through. Quickly, his whole body, blood, organs, bones, and all separated themselves from him, and he was gone. All that was left was the food in his bowels, it looked like McDonald's, and an artificial hip. A sound, like lightning being torn in half, screamed across us, and the light closed off as the portal closed. The player spit the tape out. 

There was such an awful silence after that. Gregg and I just stared at the spot, obviously in shock. I mean, how else were we supposed to react? Finally, I began to move back into the room, and Gregg inched forward with me. I rounded the corner and found that neither the TV nor the VHS player showed any signs of being involved in the inexplicable horror that had just unfolded. I turned over and found the tape lying sideways behind the coffee table. I hovered my hand over it for a second, and I even dropped an old fry from the floor on it first. No effect, after I lightly tapped it with the back of my arm, I picked it up. Gregg and I stared down at it. The symbols on the sides had turned bright red.

""What do we do?""

Hearing another person's voice after all that and all the silence shook me for a moment. I thought for a second, but the thoughts just wouldn't form. What could the police do? What could anyone do? It certainly didn't seem like he was going to be in any savable state. Even before his body had disintegrated, that tape had affected his mind. The only thing that could have possibly been done for him was to watch the tape ourselves and try to figure it out, or I guess to go in after him. And we sure as hell weren't doing that. I didn't even know the guy and Gregg had always said he was kind of a dick.

Gregg walked over, picked up the replacement hip, and turned back to me. 

""Listen, I'm gonna throw this away, and then I'm gonna clear the security footage. If anyone asks, let's just say he skipped town.""

I didn't really have any other ideas, so I nodded. After I finally got my legs moving again, I quickly walked out the door and sped all the way back to the house. As I sat in the kitchen, eyes wide open, trying to ignore the sound of distant scratching, I went over everything in my head over again. I felt like a character in a horror game who finally realizes they are in a supernatural, deadly situation, and that things are far beyond their knowledge and control. I realized I hadn't locked my car door, and I stuffed my hand into my pocket to retrieve my keys, but as I did so, my hand ran over crumpled paper. I pulled the slip out with my keys, pressed the button to lock my door, and then looked over it. It was the receipt that the machine in the attic had returned to me. A worried feeling suddenly washed over me when I reread the line:

""Retrieve the unmarked tape, and return for further instructions.""

I got up and made my way upstairs. It took a while to get myself to do it, but after I smacked the door with the latch key a couple of times and the scratching stopped, I opened it up and slowly climbed upstairs. Poking my head through, I really felt like I was in a horror game.

There wasn't anything waiting to rip me in half on the other side, thankfully, but I still didn't feel good up there. The 5th was still playing in the distance. I walked back over to the machine, which somehow had another layer of dust. I blew it off, and as I stood there coughing once more, I made a note to start donning a face mask and arming myself with a can of keyboard cleaner.

My heart sank as I pressed a button to bring the machine back to life. It said, clearly, ""DO NOT PLAY THE TAPE. Deposit tape here and then store it."" 

I did as I was instructed, and the machine began to whirr for a while. As I waited, I noticed that the attic layout had clearly changed. I don't mean something got knocked over; I mean everything was moved around. Even the egregious amount of old clothes seemingly walked around on their own and ended up planting themselves in places that seemed semi-organized. Finally, I heard another deep chunk and turned back around to find the tape waiting for retrieval. It was no longer glowing on the sides.

I felt tired, and I still do. I just put the tape down beside the machine and covered it with a shirt. I headed back downstairs and locked the latch again, but I jumped as I heard something slam into it, followed by more scratching.

That was yesterday. I remember lying around the house for the rest of the day with all the lights off. It was surprisingly easy to brush off the manager's death. After all, he was aiding a local crime ring in selling drugs, and not like pot, I mean, the life-ruining ones. Also, Gregg told me he was kind of a dick. But, really, I was bothered by the situation I had found myself in. I was in a new world of unknowns, and I didn't know any of the rules, if there were rules at all. It's also just hard to relax with such an ominous space looming just above me, emanating those scratching sounds, all day long. 

What certainly didn't help was that I'd slowly begun to work my way through the fridge, and a fresh batch of bills had piled in through the mail, but, much to my surprise, when I came out to check the mail this morning, I found another envelope. It was cream colored, and the textured paper was very pleasant to touch. When I opened it, I found a check, one from Mr. Cavae, to me, and with enough money on it to clear all my worries about bills and groceries. There was a note. 

""Good job on your first order, Wyatt. For this first order, we're giving you the whole check, but from here on out 30% goes back to us. Keep this up, and you'll have plenty more deposits to look forward to as you clear your debts.""

I wondered for a moment why someone as powerful as him, or whatever he was representing, would have any need for Earthly cash, but I just decided to take my money and shut up. I was also grateful that I wasn't going to be punished for my mistake.

And now, here I am. I've paid all the bills and bought all the fridge essentials: eggs, pizza rolls, almond milk, and beer. The scratching has quieted down a bit, but it's still there. I catch myself wondering if I should try to find some way out of this, to end my ""relationship"" with Cavae and all this madness, but something tells me that's not an option anymore. I think after I post this, I'll check on the next order. Maybe keep a look out in case I'm dumb enough to do another [order](https://www.reddit.com/user/MDTStories/). Wish me luck, pray for me, or do whatever it is you do. I'll try to get an update on Gregg.",7,1751937822.0,nosleep,3,0.9,False

It really helped us be more intentional about where we ate and how we explored your city. We hit almost all the spots on our list, and then some. 

My favourite bites: Honey and Cream Cake at Spoon and Stable, Yam Roulade at Minari, Hmong Sausage Bowl at Diane's Place. My partner's favourite bites: Crispy Laab at Mandalay Kitchen, Basil Wings at Gai Noi, and Yam Roulade at Minari. Honourable mentions to Whitefish and Avocado Toast at Razava, Coconut Shrimp Toast at Hai Hai, Quesabirria at Oro, and Crabby Rice at Vinai.

We didn't enjoy Sanjusan (think it was an off night, we were sweating and the dough the raw on the pizza). Pizza Luce was ok (largely what we expected). Cafe Latte was surprisingly okay - we expected it to be lighter and less sugar tasting (more actual flavour). We also didn't like Cardamom, the pita was stale and everything was under seasoned.

For anyone interested in how gluttonous we were, below is what we ended up eating throughout our trip. We walked a total of 102k steps over our \~3 days visiting and honestly, we can't wait to come back! 

Thursday: Diane's Place \[hmong sausage bowl, thai iced tea French toast, scallion danish\], Vinai \[crabby rice\], Oro by Nixta \[quesabirria\], Minari \[yam roulade\]. 

Friday: Isles Bun \[cinnamon roll, puppy tail, coffee cake (LOVE)\], Crooked Pint \[pickled juicy Lucy\], Pizza Luce \[two pizzas I can't recall\], Fletcher's \[lemon poppyseed and cinnamon?\], Hai Hai \[shrimp toast, chicken thigh, and tiramisu\]

Saturday: Egg on a Roll \[tuscany and breakfast in Bombay\], Cardamom \[Fried Chicken Pita\], Gai Noi \[wings\], Bebe Zito \[blackberry butter birthday cake and halva coffee (LOVE)\], Quang (pho and banh mi), Chimborazo (empanada), Sanjusan (Verdi and Arancini), Spoon and Stable (strawberry dessert and honey dessert). 

Sunday: Brake Bread (almond scone and cardamom spinner), Razava Bread (toast, Jerusalem bagel, and tomato scone), Mandalay Kitchen (crispy laab, the beef curry...wow), Marc Heu (tart), Caffe Latte (German chocolate and tres leches). 

If we did things differently, we would have skipped Sanjusan and subbed with Porzana or 112 Eatery; possibly gotten breakfast at Alma, and eaten at Matt's.

1lubv9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lubv9o/have_i_been_friendzoned/,Have I been FriendZoned?? 🤷🏻‍♀️,"I spent the holiday weekend alone in a mountain town to hike. I’m recently divorced, and have been meeting people here & there, not really connecting with anyone . 
On Thursday, I got a notification from Facebook dating from someone who “liked me” from another state about 12 hours away.
He was very handsome, totally my type & his bio was right in line with what I was looking for.

He opened with “starts driving to (insert my state here)” and I responded, jokingly, “ok come hike with me”. Long story short, he had the weekend off and agreed to make the drive the next morning while I tackled a very long, grueling hike by myself. We planned to get dinner that night , then hike together the next day. 

After my hike & on my way to dinner, my tire literally exploded. I was stranded on the side of the road, he came to assist until the tow truck got there. With the tow being hours away, we tried to find local fireworks to watch and sat on a dock on a lake. Then we drove around talking and listening to music. He dropped me at my Airbnb, didn’t kiss me, did not make a move. The next day he picked me up at my Airbnb to go for our hike & we had a lovely day. He took photos of me at a waterfall and he passed a comment 
“You won’t be single for long after these photos” 

I said “wait what?” And he responds “I was trying to say you’re beautiful” and I blushed super hard, and replied with a modest thank you.

With my car unable to be fixed until Monday, he drove me a few hours back to my house as he was supposed to pass through my area to visit old friends / family. We stopped to get lunch, he wouldn’t let me pay, and we had a lovely time.
We then got back to my house, and After two long days of driving, I offered he spend the night and we went out for dinner. I made him let me buy dinner and thanked him for his help, and he slept on the couch.

The next morning we got coffee, (He refused to let me pay for coffee) took a walk together, and he hit the road with nothing more than a hug. I texted him telling him I was sorry for the first night having a wrench thrown in it, and that I really enjoyed my time with him.

He did not respond, and about 10 hours later, sent me a few of the photos he took of me. Then  said “don’t say sorry, it was a great time”. I thanked him for the photos, and asked if he enjoyed his time with friends. He said he did, to which I replied that I was really glad. 0 communication since. 

I’m totally lost. Is he just not into me? 
Or did I fumble it by being too awkward/shy when he made the comment about calling me beautiful?

Why send the photos if he didn’t plan to talk to me any further?
Should I reach out again or give him a few days?
I really enjoyed my time with this guy and am very very attracted to him. I’m afraid to come off too strong/clingy or be too distant/cold.

The first ones were in June now it happened again. I woke up around 1 am feeling cold and shivering despite having a very thick blanket. I am 16 years old and is sleeping beside my mom, when she noticed it, she decided to sleep hugging me but it didn't work out so I decided to change (i wear shorts and i changed into pjs). I turned off the fan too but nothing seems to be working out. My mom decided to make me take ‘biogesic’ and wait for me to sweat since she said I had a mild fever due to my body temp (she said sweat indicates it disappeared). 

What happened before this is I took a 💩. I am severely constipated and I drank black coffee around 9 PM just to be able to 💩. My 💩 is hard and probably strained me because it hurts to pass by (also, I have a fissure that’s why it kinda bleed). After taking 💩, I immediately went to bed (w the same clothes, not sure if it became wet) and this is embarrassing to say but I cried before sleeping. Does that have a connection? IDK. My parents are mad at me now for what happened around midnight and they’re planning to take me out to a check up (which I’m scared, huhu). And also, around the morning, I got caught up with a light rain (which I think might contribute in the mild fever i’m feeling).

1lubtaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weddingsunder10k/comments/1lubtaw/is_halloween_movie_night_themed_wedding_tacky4k/,Is Halloween movie night themed wedding tacky?4K budget,"Hello all,

My fiancé and I have been together for about 7 years now, and are planning on tying the knot next Halloween (2026). We’re going for kind of a witchy fall vibe. We would have at most 50 guests, all immediate family or really close friends. We really don’t want to spend more than 4K as we are saving up for a house 

I would love an outdoor wedding but since we live in Florida the threat of bugs and rain lead us to choose an event space at one of the state parks in the area. It has really pretty lighting larger windows towards the back, A/c (the most important part), and commercial style kitchen, restrooms, and includes tables and chairs for 80. The space is available for $268/ day and I was thinking about renting it for 2 day 1 day for set up and then the next for the event. I wanted to rent a coffee truck to be there before the event to buy us some extra getting ready time.

For deco I was leaning more towards DIY: black pumpkin arch, stretched spider webs, deep burgundy table cloths with a fake moss table runners, fake autumn leaves for the flower girl (or sunflowers) mini lanterns with a fake flame, and larger ones to add flowers into for the bridal party bouquets/centerpieces 

Entertainment: Our guests aren’t known to be dancers I was thinking just to rent a few speakers and make our own wedding playlist with some Halloween themed music (love potion #9) to play in the background of the event with a dance floor area. I was also going to rent a projector and a popcorn machine. I was thinking of playing a slide show of pictures of us. After the ceremony we’d set up some comfy sitting areas and play some classic scary movies on it. We are also well known board/card game collectors, so I was thinking of setting up an introverts corner with a ton of board games!

Food: I was looking into getting a food truck or having one of our favorite local pizza places cater the event. 
Drinks I was just going to buy a couple cases of wine, sodas, and carafes of lavender lemonade (or something similar). 
Dessert: I was going to talk to one of my local bakeries about making a tiered cake that looks like a tree stump. Chia flavored sponge cake with a maple bourbon frosting. I also wanted to have a s’mores bar option since we have access to the fire pit area (weather permitting)

Dress code: I don’t want to do a costume wedding, but I’m not sure if semi formal fits this event. I also don’t want to look out of place in my dress. It is white but less traditional, very drapey, open back, with embroidered greenery around the bottom crawling up. I was going to do gold leafy accessories. Bridesmaids can pick their own dress/ color shade I’m either going with autumn leave colors or deep greens.

Photography: I’ve looked in the area and I haven’t found many options shy of $1000. I don’t want the whole event captured really just a few key moments like getting ready, 1st looks, the I do, the cake cutting, and a few of the family/ wedding party.

That’s all I have so far. I really want it to be a small intimate event; I’m just worried that it’s not enough for a wedding :(

Any suggestions are much appreciated!

Insomnia (recently developed in the past month)
Blurred vision upon standing too fast

Some of the labs and results that may be relevant to this are:
Previous low glucose tests (I had a freestyle libre monitor for 2 weeks and the alarm went off every night due to low glucose. This is in addition to blood tests in multiple visits resulting in glucose at 55 mg/dL even though I had eaten prior to the blood draw)
Low sodium (135 mmol/L), low anion gap (3 mmol/L), and elevated amylase (114 U/L) on my most recent blood draw (~1.5 weeks ago)
I have a family history of diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, cancer, and an aortic aneurysm
I grew up in a highly polluted town with 7 industrial facilities surrounding the town (they emit sulfur dioxide, hexavalent chromium, VOCs, carbon black, among other contaminants)
There have been no significant findings on multiple CT scans (brain, abdomen) or on an echocardiogram
Diagnosed with vestibular migraines, PTSD, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and ADHD

Medications and history:
Currently I am taking ondansetron odt as needed, albuterol as needed, and will begin omeprazole tomorrow morning.
Previously I was on lamotrigine, aripiprazole, lorazepam, and buproprion but am in between psychiatrists for medication management (this is a priority I guarantee you)

I am honestly just exhausted, in pain, and tired all the time so I would appreciate any advice.",1,1751937390.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
