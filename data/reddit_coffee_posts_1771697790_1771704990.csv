1rb19mm,https://i.redd.it/ienbebr3owkg1.jpeg,Best Coffee Grinder for De’Longhi Dedica EC890 — Timemore C5 ESP Pro vs Kingrinder K6?,"Hi everyone,  
I’m looking for a good coffee grinder for my De’Longhi Dedica Duo EC890. I previously tried an Agaro grinder, but it didn’t work properly for espresso. I also tried using pre-ground coffee, but the taste just isn’t as good as freshly ground beans.

Right now, I’m considering two options: the Timemore C5 ESP Pro and the Kingrinder K6. If anyone has experience with these, I’d really appreciate your recommendation — especially in terms of espresso grind quality, consistency, and ease of use.

Also, if you know reliable places to buy them (in India or online), please share. Thanks a lot",1,1771704880.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
1rb18b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1rb18b6/what_should_i_feel_about_this_whole_situation/,What should I feel about this whole situation.,"So I (20F)asked out this guy (22M) I found on Instagram. He’s good-looking, confident, freelances after finishing BBA, total “cool guy” vibe. We don’t have mutuals, but I texted him first and asked if he’d like to grab coffee.

He said yes pretty casually, when I asked him the reason during the date about him saying yes, he answered with “I had no reason to say no.”

That line already threw me off a bit, like was it interest or just indifference?

Anyway, the date happened on the last monday. First thing, he went for a side hug, I misread and shook his hand instead (kill me)

We ended up talking for 3.5 hours. Conversations weren’t awkward but not much exciting either; we talked about college, work, family, random stuff.

He paid for everything, opened doors, bought me a snack to take home, even remembered my name spelling right (which no one ever does) and said his mom has the same name. He asked for my number, we took a few mirror selfies, and he dropped me off at the metro. Tried the hug again, this time it worked. All in all, it was a good date.

I texted later saying I reached home and had a nice time. He replied, “Glad to hear that, I had a nice time too. I’m still out working out tho.”

I said “All the best with work,” and then he thanked and wished me a safe journey and whether I packed my bags,i replied with yes I'll be packing now, then he replied 'okayy'. that's it.Since then, no text, just a like on my story on the next day itself (a mirror pic).

He mentioned on the date that he hasn’t dated in a year, had a 5-year long-distance relationship before that.

So now I’m wondering , if he was polite, attentive, stayed for 3.5 hours, and even initiated small gestures like hugs and photos… why go quiet afterward?

If he wasn’t interested, he could’ve ended it fast. But if he was, why no follow-up?

Is this just his way of keeping things light, or is he playing that “I’ll wait for her to text first again” game because I approached him?

Why show interest in person and then retreat into silence?

Would appreciate some outside perspectives — his behavior just doesn’t line up.",1,1771704791.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

\*INFO FROM WRITER\* Feel free to alter or edit this script if you want. You may use this script for any platform. I do not need to be credited, but would love to recieve a message if this script is published as an audio. Have fun :)



Abstract for the Listener:

Your shy bff has a tattoo appointment and is nervous about going alone, so she asks you

to come along as emotional support. In the shop she accidentally calls you her

boyfriend so you both must play along. On the way home she brings it up and confesses.

  
Abstract for the Speaker

S and L are very close Friends and are slightly crushing on each other. Since they are

both a little shy and afraid to ruin years of friendship, both never brought it up.

S wanted to prove to herself that she could be brave and decided to get her first tattoo

without telling anyone in advance and without someone holding her hand. On the day of

the appointment her nerves get the better of her and since she really wants the tattoo

and doesn’t want to chicken out, she calls her best friend (L) to come along and morally

support her.



**On the phone:**



S *\[notably very uncomfortable with having to make this call\]*: Hi, … ahm weird question…

are you free this afternoon?... At one o’clock? I might need your help with something.



L: Let me check. What do you need me for?



S: Do I HAVE to tell you? Can you not just support your best friend when she calls you

once in like forever to help her out? I would reeeeeaaaaally appreciate it.



L: Do you want me to rescue you from a date? Do you need me to be your date? Again?



S: No, I do not need you to be my date AGAIN – also that was only once, and you got a

free dinner out of it so shut it. *\[hesitating\]* I… have an appointment at one and could

really use someone to… morally support me.



L: What kind of appointment do you have?



S: *\[realizes that resistance is futile\]* \*Sigh\* I… have a tattoo appointment…



L: A WHAT?



S: A tattoo appointment. I thought I would be brave enough to go all by myself but now

I’m getting really nervous and am scared to chicken out and I really, really don’t want to

chicken out since I really want that tattoo… and I also want to be brave for once.



L: Why haven’t you said something?



S: As I said: I wanted to be brave and do it all by myself. I’m a grown-up woman and I

should not need help with everything in my life. And I thought… *\[Now slightly annoyed\]*

\*ugh\* Actually, I don’t want to discuss this with you on the phone. Are you going to come

or are you not? In that case I would ask Stacy.



L: Don’t worry, I’ll be there.



S: Thank you. Was that so hard? I’ll text you the address of the studio.



**Now in front of the studio:**



S: Thank you for coming. This really helps me to keep cool right now.



L: You know what you are doing? Don’t just get a tattoo because you want to prove

something to yourself.



S: I’m not just trying to prove something to myself. I secretly wanted to get a tattoo since

I turned 18 which honestly is already shockingly long ago. But I never thought that a shy

girl like me could get tattooed. Tattoos were something the loud, cool and outgoing girls

had. So, I never mustered the courage to talk about it to anyone, let alone go and get it

done. *\[pause\]* But a couple of months ago, I was scrolling and this artist popped up in

my feed, and I instantly fell in love with her work. And after literal weeks of pondering,

thinking and overthinking I thought: screw it! I want this, so I can do this! So I went ahead

and sent her a message. And two weeks ago, I went to a consultation appointment with

her which was really nice and she was so sweet and I realized: “hey this isn’t too

difficult!”. So we scheduled an appointment and I was looking forward to it all the time,

imagining how the tattoo would look… But then yesterday I started to get nervous and

this morning that nervousness had morphed into anxiety… so I called you.



L: If you are certain that you want this, I’ll even hold your hand.



S: I am sure I want this. And thank you, though I don’t think you’ll have to hold my hand.

\*Doorbell ringing\*



**Now, inside the studio.** 



The stencil has been placed; S is looking at herself in the mirror.



S: What do you think? Isn’t this too cute? I think it was the right choice to go with the

bigger version. The smaller ones felt a little lost on my arm.

Shure, it will take longer, and it will be more painful, but that should not be the question,

when you think about permanently inking something into your skin. \[Pause\] I also really

love the placement. I know, the inner bicep is supposed to hurt more, but I just love how

most of it is hidden most of the time, and just some of the leaves wrap around and are

showing when you look straight at me. It draws the eye without being too much in your

face like “Hey look at me, I am tattooed!”

I know that this is a rather large design for a first tattoo, but I wouldn’t want it any other

way.



L: What made you choose that design?



S: The design? You remember that my mom used to read to me when I was little right?

One of my favorite stories was that of a little robin: I always admired that these little

guys stay here during winter and do not fly south, while all the bigger birds do. It reminds

me that no matter how small you might feel, you can endure everything and even thrive,

whatever the circumstances and the odds may be.

And the mistletoe it is perched on, just goes so well with it – the leaves have such a

pretty shape and it stays green in winter and even has berries! \[now a little cheeky\] Also,

this way I will always have my personal mistletoe on me – like literally on me.



L: What for?



S: What for, you are asking? In case I want to kiss someone.

\*excited squeaky noises\* I’m so excited! But not so much the scared excited anymore,

but more the happy excited! Thank you for being here with me.

Okay, she’s coming back.



A: What do you think? Shall we begin?



S: U huh. I love the design, the size and the placement. Let’s do this.

\*rustling as S gets into the chair\*



S: I think I am ready – can you hold my hand please? Just for the first few lines?

\*tattoo machine begins to hum\*



S: \*slowly breathes in and out\* Actually, this isn’t too bad. I mean sure, it hurts, but I

expected way worse. But I didn’t imagine to feel that much of the vibration.



A:…



S: Oh, it will be bad once we are a few hours in? Don’t tell me that!



\*machine keeps humming, fades out and in again to signal some time has passed\*



S: \*winces\* Ow, that spot is a little spicy. \*makes whiny noises\* When we were just

doing the Linework I thought this would be super easy, but shading definitely is

something else.



L: Would you like some snacks? I can get you something.



S: If I want something to eat? Uhhhh, I think I might actually crave a hot chocolate and a

doughnut. So this is definitely a yes! There is a coffee shop right around the corner.

You’re such a sweetheart for offering to get me something.



\*machine noise fades as L goes to fetch a hot C and a doughnut\*



\*Doorbell rings, machine fades back in as L returns. With it, the conversation between S

and her artist fades in as well\*



S: …yea I know, it was such a good movie! My boyfriend also really liked it; we talked

about it the entire evening after we came out of the cinema and we still joke about it

every now and then.



S: \[realizing she slipped and L heard the sentence\] … Ehhhhm, thank you for the snacks,

HONEY. What would I do without a BOYFREIND like you? \[to Artist\] Can we take a short

little break so I can eat? Yes? Perfect, thank you. \*winces and groans as she gets up\*



\*whispering very intently\* Do. Not. Say. A. Word! I have no idea what happened there

and why I said what I said. It just kinda slipped out. Maybe the pain finally got me, after

hours of getting stabbed. I feel like I have had a glass or two too many.



\*chewing and still in a low voice\* I can explain! She talked about her husband and how

they like to go to the movies, and I told her how we like to do the same thing and she

assumed you were my partner and somehow my brain skipped a thought, and I didn’t

correct her immediately and then it was too late and I had to go with it to not embarrass

myself so I called you my “boyfriend”.

Can you please just play along? I am in too deep to change the story now!...

Look, we’re almost done and I would have to leave with an unfinished tattoo out of pure

embarrassment if I’d have to explain that we are not a couple. Now shush, she’s coming

back! Quick, do something sweet!



L: You’re almost done and you are doing great. Hang in there babe \*kisses Ss forehead

as she gets back into the chair\*



A: Aren’t you guys sweet.



S: \[now really flustered\] Yes, we really are cute sometimes. The kiss on the forehead is

our little thing… \[now awkwardly trying to loosen up with a joke\] It also saves my lipstick

from smudging during the day. \[with a smirk\] He just has to wipe his face every now and

then.

Yes, sure, I’ll lie still. Let’s finish this sucker up.



\*machine begins to hum again\*



S: \*wincing silently\* It sure hurts more after the break. I thought it would help. And when

you said you were only going to add some little highlights... OUCH!... when you said you

only wanted to add some highlights I did not know you wanted to torture me even more

!... Can you hold my hand again honey?



\*humming fades out and in again to signal some time has passed. Then stops\*



S: We’re done? Like completely done?



A:Yes we are. I just have to clean you up.



S: Sure, I’ll wait for you to wipe it down. \*inhales sharply as artist wipes the fresh tattoo\*

Ouch! I was not expecting a wetwipe to be that spicy! \*catches her breath\* Can I get up?



\*gets up groaning and admires herself in the mirror\*



Wow, it turned out so much prettier than I imagined! I love it! I have a little robin-friend

now! And look how sweet she is! \*excited squeaky noises\* I cannot thank you enough!

This is truly a work of art. What do you think honey? Do you like your new tattooed

girlfriend?



L: It really is pretty and suits you very well.



S: Thank you. \*kisses L on the forehead\* I have to say it was sooooo worth the pain and I

am so glad I got it. I was actually quite nervous right before we started. \*giggles\*



A: Wonderful, let us put the second skin on.

Okay, yes. Let us put the second skin on and then I’ll pay.



\*ambient noise fades out and back in, car door slams shut\*



**In the car**



S: Thank you for coming. You were a really big support for me and I realized that being

courageous does not mean that you have to do everything all alone. That’s what you

have a partner for… \[correcting herself\] I mean,... that's what you have a best friend for.



\*awkward silence\*



S: \*takes a deep breath\* I have already been courageous once today. I can be

courageous again: When I called you my boyfriend earlier… Maybe it wasn’t as much of

an accident as I said.



\*reconsidering her approach\*



When you kissed my forehead, and called me babe, I got this warm fuzzy feeling in my

tummy. It felt so good, so reassuring to have you by my side as a boyfriend and partner –

even if we were just acting… I think I might know why I slipped and said that we were a

couple: Yes sure my brain was cooked, but deep down I would really like that idea of us

being… a couple. And when we kept acting I realized, I don’t want this to end. I want to

continue calling you honey and babe, I want to continue the little peck on the forehead, I

want to hold your hand more often.

I want to keep you as a best friend but… I want more. I want you as my boyfriend, my

partner, and I want all the things that come with that. I want cuddles, kisses and date

nights… \[now a little concerned\] If you want that too, that is…



L: I would love that.



S: You do? Does that mean we are a \[is shut up by a kiss\] \*whispers between kisses\*

careful with my arm \*kisses continue\*. Does that mean, we are…? \*excited squeaky

noises\*

Actually, this fits really well! The mistletoe seems to have worked right away…. By the

way, I still have to make a second confession today: my parents have no idea that I got a

tattoo, but I guess they will forgive me when I tell them that I got a boyfriend along the

way.

Shall we grab something to eat? The doughnut has just about worn off and I think we

have a lot to talk about.",1,1771704751.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False

He has bi-polar and has a Migration background from a country that's currently in a war. The relationship was  good at  the beginning, he had a lot of storys to tell where now I figured out that most things aren't actually true or just not possible, but back than, especially with the traumatic things he talked about (where as far as I know a lot of them aren't true as well) it was weird to question them? 

Anyway the relationship ended because he wasn't feeling good, was only staying in his room (or so I thought), because of everything going on with the war etc. I tried to support him and helped him out in ways that I could (like for example cooking for him) but he said that he wasn't able to be in a relationship right now and that he has to deal with his trauma. Of course I was sad, but I also didn't really feel like we were in a relationship anymore anyway, I felt more like a not so effective care taker and I also have seen him 3 times in 2 1/2 months because of his mental state, so I was okay with ending it. I spent those months at home mostly hoping that tonight would be the night where he maybe had the strength to go outside and I was glad that the waiting was over as well.

We had a talk where talked it out and we decided to break up with no hard feelings (or so I thought) and after that I saw him more often just being outside and what not also with another girl that I would call his ,,best friend"" when we were still together. In my head I was like ,,okay I'm glad that he's feeling better, but it looks like the reasons we broke up aren't the real ones?"" I got pretty cold towards seeing them together because I was confused. I texted her that I'm sorry if I am being cold to her in a way but that I just didn't quite understand the whole situation and she said that she wanted to talk to me anyway. We met for coffee (which he tried to stop from happening) and then yeah...

Come to find out that he told her that I forced him into an open relationship and that I didn't see him so often in those 2 1/2 months because i was busy fucking randome people and that I only talked to him about my Sexy-Partners. Everytime he told me that he's feeling so bad and can't socialize they've been together at his place and did what not. I told her that his story is bullshit and doesn't make any sense, showed her our texts and tried to understand why the fuck he would to that. Cheating and lying is the one thing, but framing me as a villain to cheat and lie is the other. I texted him and asked but of course he never answered. She said that she was sorry, that she should've known better.

The ,,knowing"" part didn't really last long, because I saw her on the same day in the city and asked her how she was doing and she told me that they are planning to go on a trip together. She basically acted like nothing happened. She went away for an Erasmus and recently came back and here is where my problem is;

She is trying to be too fucking friendly. It would be one thing if we acknowledge each other, but she is full on waving and grins and it's just very confusing. He of course isn't looking at me, because I only see them together but I am at my nerves end. I never got the chance to confront any of them because he never answered and actually ran away the first few times he saw me and she just completely backed off from reality and is trying to be overly nice to maybe feel better about herself?

I know this whole thing is stupid, and I just want to be over with it but I don't know how to react to this nonsense as well so yeah, what would you do?",1,1771704596.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

He asked for my number, we took a few mirror selfies, and he dropped me off at the metro. Tried the hug again, this time it worked. All in all, it was a good date.

I texted later saying I reached home and had a nice time. He replied, “Glad to hear that, I had a nice time too. I’m still out working out tho.”

I said “All the best with work,” and then he thanked and wished me a safe journey and whether I packed my bags,i replied with yes I'll be packing now, then he replied 'okayy'. that's it.Since then, no text, just a like on my story on the next day itself (a mirror pic).

He mentioned on the date that he hasn’t dated in a year, had a 5-year long-distance relationship before that.

So now I’m wondering , if he was polite, attentive, stayed for 3.5 hours, and even initiated small gestures like hugs and photos… why go quiet afterward?

If he wasn’t interested, he could’ve ended it fast. But if he was, why no follow-up?

Is this just his way of keeping things light, or is he playing that “I’ll wait for her to text first again” game because I approached him?

Why show interest in person and then retreat into silence?

Would appreciate some outside perspectives — his behavior just doesn’t line up.",2,1771704583.0,RelationshipIndia,1,1.0,False

I (14F) have been stressing over a particular thing that is very big in my life at the moment. In my school we have something we call “culture crew”. It’s basically a bunch of students who help musicians that come to our school. We help them set up a scene, we make them coffee, tea and water and we also make sandwiches for them. This has been a thing for two years, I’ve been in it from the beginning.

I’m the oldest student in this crew (the others are 13 (14 in November), 12 and 12) and I am usually the one who keeps the peace between us students and the school leaders. Therefore this has been nagging me even more.

Every year we go to a seminar, just for a day, where we learn about the things we need to know. This includes public speaking, talking to musicians, helping taking care of the gear etc.

Our school gives us transportation (we have a mini bus) so we don’t have to worry about that.

The principal (I’ll call her Amanda) was supposed to give us a week notice for when we were supposed to go. None of us received anything in our school mail, so none of us knew the date.

I know that the vice principal (I’ll call him Bob) had told me two weeks before we were supposed to go, and when, but this was in the middle of the school day and we are not allowed to have our phones, so I never got the chance to write it down. Later, I forgot as I was very busy that day.

Fast forward to last Monday, when we were supposed to go to the seminar.

I sit in class first period, and so does my classmate (13M). All of a sudden our English teacher comes in and tells us that we are late “to where we are supposed to go today”. I didn’t know what he was talking about and neither did my classmate from the look of his face. We follow our English teacher and see the minibus. I proceed to question English Teacher and he reminds me that it is the day of the seminar. I see that both 12F and 12M are in the bus, waiting. I also see a pedagogue, who is supposed to drive us. Me and 13M quickly get into the bus. We are around five minutes late to the seminar, we missed the introduction.

We see Amanda waiting for us, Pedagogue tells her why we are late (because me and 13M were late and forgot). Amanda seemingly don‘t care and just tells us to sit down. Pedagogue drives back to school.

After that we have some activities that we participate in and then we have a lunch break. I believe this was around 12 pm. Amanda pulls me aside, asks why we forgot that it was today and that she had sent a mail to us all. I do want to say that the school uses a special app where parents, kids and teachers can talk together. We cannot find anyone who doesn‘t go the school or teaches here. This is somewhat how our conversation went:

Amanda: “Why did you and 13M forget? You guys are the older ones and shouldn’t put a bad example.”

Me: “Sorry, but none of us got a mail.”

Amanda: “I sent it personally, what are you saying?”

Me: \*feeling awkward at this point\* “maybe you didn’t send it? Maybe you missed the send button?”

Amanda: \*looking a little hurt\* “I would never do such thing. Just admit you forgot and move on.”

Me: “Ma’am I’m sorry but we are all humans, we all make mistakes.”

Amanda: “Whatever”

She send me back. I don’t think much of it, I know she has been dealing with a lot lately as the school is doing bad financially.

The day passes, I tell the crew what Amanda said, just so they know, I also say that they should just ignore it.

We get back to the school at around 2:15 pm (for my European fellows 14:15). I go home as my classes are over, I do some homework, help around the house and end up going out with a friend.

Tuesday I get back to school, tell English Teacher what Amanda said and asked if it could be the system. He said I probably just didn’t see it. I find my computer and show him my inbox. Nothing.

Later I find Bob, ask him why we didn’t get a mail, he shrugs it off, says something about Amanda being forgetful lately and that it is in the past.

I get home, tell my mom and she checks her inbox. There the glorious mail is. The one that had the date and program.

Wednesday I ask the others in the crew if their parents had gotten anything.  
Turns out Amanda had sent it to our parents, not us.

I also find out that Bob told Amanda that I had asked him and now Amanda wants me to come in Monday.

AIO for getting so many people involved in this?

I‘m so sorry if the time line and events are confusing. Please give me any advice possible.",2,1771704316.0,AIO,1,1.0,False

Ill do my best to explain the fragrances haha:

Xerjoff Uden: Creamy and dark lemon cake that has coffee and rum mixed in. It gets compared to Chanel edition blanche and honestly for good reason, it shares the kind of dna but makes it darker and smoother. Spring and summer classy masterpiece

Kerosene Summer Of 84: Delicious and extremely vibrant citrus. It is supposedly grapefruit and melon but what i get is quite literally the juiciest orange getting peeled and you squeeze the juice, it is the best and natural citrus in my collection by far, extremely fun and nostalgic fragrance.

Alexandria Fragrances Gemstone: This fragrance is literally talked about no where, its a clone of a not so known Bvlgari fragrance, Gyan, I smelt that months ago and fell in love with it but could not justify the $300+ price tag. Gemstone is the only clone I could find so i risked the blind buy on it and my oh my  they knocked it out of the park with this one, smells exactly like I remembered and truly such a powerful and classy fragrance, dark smooth incense with this patchouli note, then sprinkle in this little bit of a barbershop freshness, this is just class in a bottle for those cool nights. Im very happy they took the chance to clone Gyan, and did it phenomenally. Also side note, im very impressed by the alexandria presentation, for being a clone it is very high quality

1rb0xqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1rb0xqi/8_small_habits_that_will_change_your_life_the/,8 Small Habits That Will Change Your Life The Science Backed Expert Advice I'm Using This Year,"I spent months diving deep into research, books, podcasts, and expert interviews because I kept hitting the same wall. I'd set goals, get hyped for a week, then crash back into old patterns. Sound familiar? The problem wasn't lack of willpower. It was trying to overhaul everything at once instead of building small, sustainable habits that actually stick.

Here's what I learned from behavioral scientists, psychologists, and people who've genuinely transformed their lives: massive change doesn't come from massive action. It comes from tiny, consistent shifts that compound over time. After testing different approaches, these 8 habits have genuinely rewired how I operate daily.

**The 2-Minute Morning Reset** sounds stupidly simple but it's backed by neuroscience. Before touching your phone, sit up and do three deep breaths while setting one intention for the day. Dr. Andrew Huberman talks about this on his podcast constantly. Morning cortisol spikes are natural, but when you immediately flood your brain with notifications and stress, you're basically teaching your nervous system to stay in fight or flight mode. This micro habit creates a buffer. It takes 120 seconds but changes how you approach the entire day. I started this three months ago and the difference in my baseline anxiety is insane.

**Habit Stacking** is a concept from James Clear's Atomic Habits, which won multiple book awards and sits on bestseller lists for good reason. Clear's a habits researcher who makes complex behavioral psychology actually useful. The core idea: attach new habits to existing ones. After I brush my teeth, I do 10 pushups. After I pour coffee, I write three things I'm grateful for. Your brain already has neural pathways for existing habits, so you're basically piggybacking new behaviors onto established ones. This eliminates the willpower drain of remembering to do new things. The book will make you question everything you think you know about motivation and discipline. Seriously one of the best productivity books I've read.

**The Evening Shutdown Ritual** comes from Cal Newport's work on deep work and attention management. He's a computer science professor at Georgetown who studies productivity and focus. Spend 10 minutes before bed closing loops: check tomorrow's calendar, write down 3 priorities, move unfinished tasks to a specific day. This signals to your brain that work is done, which improves sleep quality and reduces that 3am anxiety spiral where you suddenly remember 47 things you forgot. Newport's research shows that our brains genuinely can't relax when we have open loops and vague commitments floating around.

**Micro Workouts Throughout the Day** changed my relationship with exercise entirely. Forget the ""I need a full hour at the gym or it doesn't count"" mentality. Do 10 squats while waiting for coffee to brew. Plank for 60 seconds during a Zoom call. Walk around the block after lunch. Dr. Rhonda Patrick, a biomedical scientist, has talked extensively about how breaking up sedentary time with brief movement spikes has massive metabolic and cognitive benefits. It's not about burning calories, it's about keeping your body from entering ""shutdown mode"" from sitting for 8 hours straight.

**The Finch App** for habit tracking actually makes it fun instead of feeling like homework. You take care of a little virtual bird by completing your daily habits and self care tasks. Sounds childish but the gamification aspect genuinely works. The app uses principles from behavioral psychology to build positive reinforcement loops. Way more effective than those sterile habit tracker spreadsheets that make you feel guilty.

**BeFreed** is another app worth checking out if you want to go deeper into the science behind these habits without spending hours reading. It's a personalized learning platform that pulls from habit formation books like Atomic Habits, expert interviews, and behavioral psychology research to create custom audio content based on what you're trying to build. A team from Columbia and Google built it, and the adaptive learning plan feature is surprisingly useful. You can set specific goals like ""build morning routines that stick"" or ""overcome procrastination patterns,"" and it generates a structured plan with 10-minute quick summaries or 40-minute deep dives depending on your schedule. The voice options are actually addictive, there's this sarcastic narrator that makes dense psychology research way more digestible. It's been helpful for connecting dots between different habit concepts without the commitment of reading five full books.

**The 10-3-2-1-0 Sleep Formula** comes from sleep researcher Dr. Matthew Walker's work. 10 hours before bed: no more caffeine. 3 hours before: no more food or alcohol. 2 hours before: no more work. 1 hour before: no more screens. 0: the number of times you hit snooze. I was skeptical about the screen thing until I actually tried it. Reading physical books or talking with my partner before bed instead of scrolling has legitimately improved my sleep quality. Walker's book Why We Sleep is an insanely good read if you want to understand how crucial sleep is for literally everything.

**The ""Plus One"" Social Rule** helps combat isolation without being overwhelming. Every week, reach out to one person you haven't talked to recently. Not networking, just genuine connection. Text an old friend. Comment something thoughtful on someone's post. Dr. Robert Waldinger runs the Harvard Study of Adult Development, the longest study on happiness ever conducted. Their finding? Quality relationships are the biggest predictor of lifelong happiness and health. Not money, not career success, not abs. Relationships. This tiny habit keeps you connected without requiring you to become some social butterfly.

**The Insight Timer App** for 10 minute daily meditation changed my stress response entirely. They have thousands of free guided meditations from actual teachers and psychologists, not just some random dude with a soothing voice. Even 10 minutes of mindfulness practice rewires your brain's response to stress over time. The neuroscience is solid: regular meditation literally changes brain structure in areas related to emotional regulation and self awareness. You don't need to become some zen master, just consistent practice.

These aren't revolutionary. They're not sexy. But they work because they're small enough to actually maintain when life gets chaotic. The research across psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral economics all points to the same truth: sustainable change happens through tiny, consistent actions that build momentum over time.

•    Active duty (all branches)

•    Veterans & retirees

•    Guard/Reserve

•    Military spouses and military-connected folks

The idea wouldn’t just be running fast miles , more about community, accountability, and staying healthy after military structure is gone.

Some early ideas:

•    Weekly group runs (all paces welcome — seriously)

•    Rotating locations around DC/Arlington/Alexandria

•    Social meetups or coffee afterward

•    Possibly small optional dues that go toward local veteran or community causes in the DMV

Before trying to organize anything, I wanted to gauge interest and get feedback:

•    Would this be something people would join?

•    Best nights/times for runs in DC? (weeknight vs weekend mornings?)

•    Good locations/trails that would make sense logistically?

I am really hoping to connect with people living in Amsterdam or at least somewhere nearby in the Netherlands. So you can ignore this post if you live far away. Sorry about this.

I am in the middle of a career change and building my new company. Since I am not going to an office anymore, I’ve realized how much I miss casual human connection. Quick chats, grabbing a coffee, talking about life, joking around, or just having a good conversation that clears your head.

So, I am looking for few friends or conversation buddies. Something relaxed and genuine.

A bit about me:

* I am 38M, born Indian, but living in Amsterdam from last 4 years and 15+ years around few countries in Europe, so my mindset is kind of a mix now, shaped by all the places I’ve called home.
* I am Learning Dutch, still a work in progress, but I’m trying. I can proudly order a beer in Dutch.

What I am looking for:

* Mostly friendly chats (online first is fine). Although I'm not good with texting, fair warning.
* Some healthy conversation, sometimes deep, sometimes just light and relaxing.
* IRL meet for coffee or a walk if we get along.

Note: I’m not looking for dating or anything romantic. Just friends for conversation.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a DM with a little about you (where you’re based, what you like talking about, and what kind of connection you’re looking for).",0,1771703940.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

I’m 24M. She’s 22F. We were together for a little over a year — 14 months that somehow feel like both a lifetime and a blink.

We met in a coffee shop in Chicago. I spilled coffee on myself. She laughed and handed me napkins. That’s it. That’s the stupid little moment that changed everything.

She was in nursing school. I was working at a startup, telling myself I was building a future. We built routines instead — Friday night dinners, long walks by the lake, falling asleep on FaceTime even when we were in the same city. She met my friends. I met her family. It felt real. Solid. Like something that would last.

Then I got offered my dream job in San Francisco.

She told me to go.

That’s the part that still breaks me. She didn’t beg me to stay. She didn’t make me choose. She said, “If you don’t go, you’ll resent me one day.” She loved me enough to risk losing me.

Long distance was fine at first. We tried hard. Calls every night. Random flights. Care packages. But effort doesn’t cancel out distance. Slowly, the pauses in our conversations got longer. The updates got shorter. We stopped telling each other the small things.

When I flew back for Thanksgiving, we sat in my car outside her house in silence. No yelling. No accusations. Just two people realizing love isn’t always enough.

We didn’t break up because we stopped loving each other.

We broke up because our lives were moving in different directions — and neither of us was willing to ask the other to shrink.

I keep replaying that coffee shop moment in my head, like if I stare at it long enough, I’ll find the point where we could’ve done something differently.

I don’t have a therapist. I don’t really have answers.

Now that I’m taking things a bit more seriously, I’m picking Pokemon to invest in longterm. I have some great monos for that, like an amazing Pumpkaboo. But looking at the ingredient lists for dishes, Pumpkins and Avocados for example don’t seem to show up in early or midgame dishes at all. Coffee shows up a bit earlier so I’m working on getting that unlocked now.

So I’m wondering when I should train up that Pumpkaboo to be ready to make pancakes and big dishes one day. I know pumpkins are great filler for other recipes, but is it still a net gain to be running a Pokemon daily who doesn’t contribute to what recipes I want to cook now?

Do I have a shot at a serious relationship with him?,"So I (24M, gay) met this guy (25M bi) when he texted me on Grindr-ish app like two weeks ago. We exchanged nudes and he insisted I come over, and since I live with family and can't just leave in the middle of the night, I said i can't.

During our talk, I asked if he is looking for something long term and he said he is more oriented towards fwb kind of situation but not sure.

I kinda liked him as far as I can tell and decided to not turn this into a shallow sexual thing, so I kept him in the back of my mind.

A week after this (on valentines day), he texts me saying hey whats up ""you don't text me at all"". etc. I didn't respond bc idk I was preoccupied with other stuff.

On 18th, he texts again saying ""hey what's up"". this time I respond. We text some more and (I work in a hybrid setting) I said i can maybe come over after work. We decide to meet up but later that day, a snow storm started so we decided to call it off.

The next day was also an office day, so I text this time to meet up finally, as the weather was fine that day. But I insist I want to meet this time, and not have sex. He's ok with it but is like ""ok fine we'll see :)"".

We meet up at a starbucks, he is in businesses casual attire. We start talking and talk about what do we do for work etc. He is basically a solo entrepreneur, selling mechanical parts to some factories etc.

He gives me his card, says he designed it too along with the website (he got a friend do it) hosting, all that. He tells this story about how a security at a factory didn't let him in (he says he basically goes to factories he determines, contacts purchasing managers and tries to sell to them).

I notice he has an engagement ring and before I ask him that, he says this is fake, to bond with conservative businesses owners/stakeholders to see him as an established adult, and we talk about perception, politics etc. for a while after that.

(He is absolutely not married at all and I'm 100% sure)

We talk some more and then he invites me over. I say no, but he insists a little, (not in a toxic coercive way) and I fold. We walk to his house, and on the way to his house he talks about his fantasies and kinks etc. and I go along with it but act coy and shy, (but I want it too at that point)

We reach his house, and he says his roommate's lights are on and he saw his motorbike parked. Obviously I have no way of knowing if this is the case or if he is lying to get out of the date I don't know for sure, but when I say I'll leave, says ""lets go grab coffee at this cafe i know"" which is right next to his place.

There I (as diplomatically as I can) say I have a hard time believing that his roommate is over as he planned the thing and he literally wears a ring to make sales, so I tell how I have this impression that he resorts to ""stretching the truth a bit"" pragmatically. He says he is not lying, as it was him and not me who wanted to go to his place anyway and tells a long story about how he has in bad terms with his roommates and how he is bearing it till May when his lease is over etc. I listen to him, nodding along, in disbelief but then he pulls out his phone and shows the whatsapp messages confirming the whole thing so idk.

Then we talk some more, he pays for my coffee and we part. As we part, he asks if I want to chat some more until he is finished smoking and I say I'll leave. We hug and I leave.

We part right next to his place and I took the train for like 40mins, so he asks me if I came home safe. I say I did and he then apologizes about the night and i said ""i had fun ngl"". He doesn't respond.

The next day, I send him a good morning message and he doesn't respond. I follow him on insta, he follows me back and he sends a linkedin invite. Then, in the afternoon, he says he now has his place to himself and invites me over. I send him a 🤨 emoji as the response. He doesnt' respond. Today at noon I send ""wyd"" and he still hasnt responded. It has been like 8hrs at this point.

But I fell for him because he is a fascinating guy, deep, intellectual, educated and ambitious. I am too an engineer and we have a lot in common.

I want to be with him, he is all that I can think about ever since that date and I just am crazy about him but I cannot let him know; I can't scare him.

He (when we first met) says he is more looking for a fwb situation, but on our date he complained about this movie that tells the tale of a terminally ill guy setting his best friend up with his girlfriend so she isn't alone after he dies, saying ""I would never set the person I am in love with like that I am not permissive like that I'm possessive"" all that. He also said he deleted the Grindr-like app after we exchanged numbers that day. Idk if he did, but is it not a sign that he sees us as more than a mere hookup?

This week I hit a snag with my drone footage: corrupted video files over 1 GB wouldn’t load. It usually happens when the drone powers off before the file finishes saving, leaving footage that won’t open and no preview.   


https://preview.redd.it/jhdxma0jiwkg1.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3943840cd59aff165bc5ba4cd35b0cf13fef07e

  
A quick Google search turned up a few fixes, most priced between $10 and $60. I thought, “Dude, just code a solution and fix the video.” That’s my brand of confidence—yeah, I call myself dude. ;\_)

So I built it in under three hours using Antigravity. What did I do?  
I created a working desktop app with a simple GUI that repairs corrupted video containers.

It’s live here:  
[https://github.com/tvcnet/videorepair/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/tvcnet/videorepair/blob/main/README.md)  
""Restore damaged (truncated) MP4/MOV/M4V/3GP video files""

As far as I can tell, this is the only free, open-source video corruption repair tool with a clean interface available today.  
  
The alternatives?

• $60+ commercial software (I took their business on a Saturday).  
  
• A handful of questionable “upload your video here” sites

That gap used to be a business model (I don't think so).  
  
• Geeking out with Untrunc. That learning curve is rather steep.  
  
\----

Now SaaS is a weekend project. And that’s the point.

We’re entering a time where SaaS isn’t just about who raises funding or buys ads. IMHO, it’s about who can identify a narrow, painful problem and solve it fast.   
  
AI tools compress development cycles from months to hours.   
  
The barrier isn’t code volume anymore. It’s clarity of intent.

This doesn’t mean every company disappears overnight. But it does mean a lot of thin-margin utilities and single-feature apps are on borrowed time.

When one person can replace a niche software product in an afternoon. Well, the economics just changed.

1rb0gax,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1rb0gax/experience_with_boundary_supply_prima/,Experience with Boundary Supply Prima,"Hey all,

I wanted to share my experience with Boundary Supply Prima System. This was spurred on by the flaking/fraying at the plastic parts of the bag, but I thought I'd share my experience overall.

**Positives**

I like the organization in the bag. The major ones are the quick access pocket up top, the side pocket access, and the ability for me to have a laptop and a tablet comfortably. While there may be a few too many pockets in certain areas that I didn't use in the main compartment, and I would have appreciated a charger compartment in the laptop, I never had any real issues so overall positive.

I like some of the materials used such as the soft touch material in the quick access, and I had the ballistic nylon version which I feel fit this pack. The magnetic fidlocks are also great.

**Negatives**

[The primary one is the flaking](https://imgur.com/a/0jHHalj). While I got this pack a while back, I've been in the process of downsizing, and I decided to keep this pack. This is my *first use* of the bag beyond a 1 hour testing at a coffee shop. I took it on a 10-day trip to London and Paris, although I didn't actually wear the backpack out much. It primarily sat in the hotel, so most of the interaction on its bottom was on the train, airport, and one instance in a coffee shop. Perhaps it's due to the age, but the fraying for the amount of use is concerning. It reminds me of the internal flaking on old North Face backpacks that I've had.

I had no use for the passthrough in the back, and could go without it.

It is a heavy bag. I wish it was lighter, but I do want to note that the weight when worn was impressively light.


Overall, I like the bag for when I want a laptop, a tablet, and have use for random items in the main compartment without thinking much about it. The fraying is concerning, and I wish there was a version with a different material at the bottom. I'm not exactly looking to expand my collection, so I'll keep using it until the fraying is more inconvenient than the backpack is useful.",1,1771702905.0,ManyBaggers,0,1.0,False

Between April to September I started vaping when layoffs at my job began. Sept-Oct got into a relationship where I later found out he was married the whole time. Got laid off from work in November. Started a new and more stressful job in December. Quit coffee and vaping in January because I was drinking 5 or more cups a day, sometimes even going to Starbucks 3 times a day and buying two coffees each time. Since Then I’ve been binging multiple times a week and tracking the calories in MyFitnessPal. I’ve gained 15lbs since Jan and I can’t stop. I started buying bronkaid to try and suppress my appetite but even when I take 3-4 pills I’m still eating thousands of calories over maintenance.

I’m stuck in a cycle and alone, unseen and I don’t know what to do anymore. I just need to shout this out because life feels so bleak right now. Everyday I say today is the last day.

I brought home some food from my recent trip to Italy in a parcel with other items. Unfortunately 2 glass lunch boxes were broken during transportation. So a lot of glass pieces were spread in the parcel and reached the food.

Fortunately the food is brand new and concealed in plastic or paper packages. I inspected them without opening them (they are gifts) and found no glass inside. But I wonder if some invisible to human eye pieces of glass reached the inside of those packages.

Do you think I should throw away all the food or it’s eatable ? Or what should I do ?

Here are some pictures (in red is Where the broken glass was). The second picture is some dust or glass dust on a coffee package, and the third is the food I’m talking about",2,1771702844.0,foodquestions,2,1.0,False
1rb0ezw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1rb0ezw/unsupportive_spouse/,Unsupportive spouse,"I just need to get this off my chest, long story short... My spouse and I have been together for 13 years. We have a child together. Live together, but i own the house we reside in and vehicles. 

So a few years ago my spouse started having some medical problems, both mental and physical. He was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and a heart condition. He was put onto medications and it totally killed his sex drive, and just his general attitude towards being touched in general. He pulled away... He doesn't do anything with me, won't even travel with me for medical appointments. Go get coffee... Nothing... I feel like i am invisible to him... 

I am a very affectionate and physical person. So I've been trying to be supportive and understanding, being there for him, but as the years have passed my own needs have been unmet and unfulfilled and i am just incredibly unhappy. 

Now 1.5 years ago i lost my mom to terminal cancer. I was her caregiver and after a rough fight against it, she ended up passing extremely traumatically in my arms, while i tried to do CPR.

 My mom was my best friend. My person, we talked every day. She came with me places... After she died i was diagnosed with ptsd, and even through this all.... My spouse still wasn't supportive, and everything i needed pushed to the side or ignored. It's to the point where if i even try to speak about how I'm feeling, he'll walk away and ""doesn't wanna hear it."" 

It ended up getting to the point where i had a sit down and decided to open our marriage, since he couldn't give me what i needed in that physcial and intimacy aspect. We agreed to open the marriage and have seperate partners on the side. Not wanting to blow up our daughters life to much. My spouse works nights and sleeps all day, and I generally work days and evenings.

I've started talking to people, making friends, and there has been only one gentleman who has really started to make me smile again. He's pretty funny and cute... But in talking with people, I'm realizing just how neglected i have been.

We had a fight the other day where my spouse blamed me for everything....including his heart condition... And called me some hurtful things... All because i asked him for help with just basic house stuff. We're now sleeping in different bedrooms, as i own the three bedroom house we live in and I've come to the realization that our marriage is pretty much over... And maybe it has been for a long time. 

I'm fine with cohabitation... For now... Coparenting and trying to keep things stable for our daughter, but i need a partner... A friend... Someone who wants to touch me, see me, calls me beautiful... And is actually present.. not just for me... But for my daughter too. 

So yeah, i just needed to get that off my chest. Cause I can't do this shit anymore. ",4,1771702818.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

My first week has looked like this:

\* Dry mouth - sipping plenty of H20 💦

\* Sore jaw (settling now)

\* Diarrhoea (maybe made worse due to taking Magnesium for sore jaw 🤦‍♀️ - stopped taking now)

\* Energy crash/irritable/bit foggy when medication wears off in the afternoon - noticing a drop from 1/2pm?

\* Vivid dreams at night

\* Taking 45 min to 1 hour for meds to kick in

\* Loss of appetite - prioritising protein with breakfast + having grab & go snacks w protein available throughout the day that don’t give me the ick

\* Reduced caffeine intake dramatically - 1x single shot a day, decaf coffee otherwise.

Overall very productive and feel good on Vyvance during the morning.

I’m in my early 40s and seriously considering a move to the Scottsdale area from Colorado. I’ve visited several times, have lived in hot climates before, and work remotely, so I’m comfortable with the weather and lifestyle.

Quick background, I’m a fee-only, fiduciary financial advisor (CFP) and run a solo RIA practice/financial planning firm. I specialize in working with retirees. I’ve been in the industry about 15 years and have owned my own firm in Golden, Colorado for about 8 years, I'd be relocating the firm.

Part of what’s drawing me to Scottsdale is wanting to be in a more vibrant, growing professional and social environment. I like being around active, health-focused communities, and I enjoy staying involved with fitness and outdoor lifestyle activities.

On the personal side, I really enjoy:

* Gyms and fitness classes (I’m a big OrangeTheory fan)
* Pickleball
* Traveling during the summer — those would basically be my “winter months,” and I’d plan to spend 1–2 months per year overseas working remotely

No kids, so schools aren’t a factor. I don’t ski or spend much time in the mountains, I enjoy working and staying busy. Originally from NYC.

**What I’m looking for:**  
I’m planning a 1-2 month Airbnb stay soon to test the area before making any permanent decisions.

I’m mainly trying to figure out:

* Best areas to stay for a 1-2 month visit
* Walkable pockets with coffee, restaurants, gyms, etc.
* Good access to the rest of the metro for networking while still feeling like a nice place to live

Is Old Town, South Scottsdale, Mesa or somewhere else the best place to start?

Also would love to hear from anyone who has relocated a solo business here or made a similar move. Appreciate any advice or local insights. Feel free to DM if you want to connect or grab coffee.",0,1771702450.0,Scottsdale,14,0.5,False

I am also an SP6 (most likely) in Enneagram and 4V in Psychosophy if that helps. I got typed SLI on a questionnaire I posted before but I don't relate to Fe polr honestly.

Here are some of my character traits, please help me understand which type they match with? Thanks so much!

My ideal day:

I actually plan out my ideal days a lot so this is easy for me to answer. Whenever I have free time, or a special occasion like a birthday, I try to plan a perfect day for myself. I like hanging out with my friends too, but when we hang out they usually plan what to do and I prefer it that way, so any day I plan myself is usually solo.

I would want to wake up in the morning, dress up in a cute outfit so that I can look in the mirror and feel satisfied and proud, and then I would head to a nice, cozy cafe where I can spend a few hours. I would take a book with me, I really love murder mysteries so if I want an easy read I would a Christie book, if I want something more dense or challenging, a classic, I'm not really a fan of YA or romance novels. Anyway, I would spend a few hours with a coffee, a sweet treat, and just have a good time reading. Then, I would head to my next destination, usually for a movie, I love watching movies. On my way home I would spend time thinking about the movie, and I would pick up my favorite food on the way to enjoy when I get home.

I'm generally just a very quiet person on my own, and rarely go out of my way to talk to others. I feel awkward when I am in a situation where I have to talk to strangers. I feel comfortable around my friends, but I remember when I was working at my internship a few years ago, I was introduced to a few people my age, and I just froze up and became really awkward around them, I didn't know how to talk to them. Though I like to believe I'd do better nowadays, the reason why I had such a hard time is because none of them were overtly welcoming, so I wasn't sure if it was okay to talk to them. This is what held me back in my high school years too, I never talked to anyone because I never felt like I had the permission to talk to them? A way I deal with this now is to mentally pretend like I'm already friends with everyone I talk to, this bypasses the barrier, because if we're friends, of course I can talk to you normally. This actually helps a decent amount. In situations where I'm comfortable I'm super friendly, I always have the biggest smile on my face to the point people have pointed out how happy my smile is. I'm always trying to make the other person happy, so I always talk about what they want to talk about and never talk too much about things I can sense they aren't interested in. This is because I'm afraid they might get bored with me and stop wanting to talk to me if I make them feel bored. I also fake laugh a lot. A reassurance along the lines of ""I'm not gonna let go of you"" is really important to me, but I also have a hard time trusting it, and constantly doubt whether they actually like me or not, whether we are close or not.

I actually really admire SLI as a type, because they're not wishy washy, they don't start conflicts but don't hesitate to deal with conflicts, they have a good and practical head on their shoulders, so they don't go too far into being misanthropic like I can sometimes but they also don't have any romantic idealistic illusions. They're a perfect balance imo. I also like LSI a lot, I just like all the ST types.

When it comes to working, I'm really lazy and procrastinate a lot. It's really hard for me to do anything at all. I tell myself that this time, I will get my work done on time, I'll start early, but I just don't feel like starting until there is a tangible pressure, like the deadline is three days away, then I will work all night before the deadline and feel absolutely terrible, and like I could've done better, but this is a cycle that's been going on my whole life. The few times I have managed to get my work done before the deadline have been really satisfying, but this is not the case the majority of the time. I honestly hate hard work, and I just want to live an enjoyable life. I think it's better to be dead than to work 60 hours a week or more, for instance, I genuinely think that's a fate worse than death. 30 hours or less is ideal for me. I despised school because of how strict it was, we had a uniform policy, hairstyle policy, attendance policy, the teachers would breathe on your neck to make you finish your work on time, we had to get up at 7am everyday and if we didn't go they would call your parents and create a big fuss. I just hated all of it, it was so unbearably overbearing, I even had a whole theory on how school is designed to turn you into the perfect worker bee who never questions authority. I loved university however, because everything is up to you, if you don't finish your work, you'll suffer, but you don't have any teachers that tell you what to do, tell you how to dress or present, tell you how many classes to show up to. It was amazing, if I could stay in university forever I would.

A random instance of my relationship with getting things done. My parents had been telling me to get a bus card for over a year, but I could never bring myself to go through with it, there would always be some problem with the documentation or something and I would give up, this was until I met a friend who directly took me to the correct avenue to request proper documentation because she really wanted to take the bus with me, encouraged by her friendship and her help, when I submitted it, it actually went through. As you can see, I am a very weak-willed person, I give up on things easily and don't have grit or discipline.

When it comes to my personal interests, I absolutely love going to discussion panels about geopolitics, economic systems, citizenship lectures that talk about the workings of the democratic society, how states work, the current chaotic state of the world and how it can be explained, the fall of the post WW2 order, polarities of power, and all that. It's extremely exciting and intellectually stimulating for me. I love systems like Socionics too, because I love the structures of the models, and how many dimensions, dichotomies, functions, elements lie behind every type, I love complexity and trying to understand complexity. I love any philosophy that deals with how we understand and engage with the world and how flawed our understandings can be. I relate to Lord Henry from The Picture of Dorian Gray when it comes to my thinking sometimes, where I am a very passive person, but I love questioning, understanding ideas, etc and almost treat the world as an intellectual exercise.

I am hypersensitive when it comes to dirt and filth. I am messy and don't keep my house in order as I would like to, I don't even bother folding clothes in my closet and straight up throw away cutlery and sometimes even dishes when I don't want to wash them. But cleaning the toilet, for instance, scars me mentally. I cannot relax at all when I go to a restaurant and the table or floor is unclean, it upsets me a lot and I can't even eat the food because the food also feels dirty. I could never imagine working cleaning toilets or wiping up tables or washing others dirty dishes, for instance. It's really important for me to live in a pretty, aesthetically pleasing area. My home country is really chaotic, unclean and kinda run down in most areas, and that's one of the main reasons I don't want to live there.

I hope this is enough information to arrive at some indicator of my type?",1,1771702449.0,Socionics,0,1.0,False

A counselor has told me that I'm a victim of institutional abuse. Basically, there is a draft here, it's quite infamous for causing a lot of damage to people.

Now, within this system was an officer who I got close to. I'd say she's early 30s, but basically, she'd often take me for days out, for coffee, at one point, my relationship with my girlfriend was falling to bits and she managed to get me a long weekend off after three months of not seeing my girlfriend. Another time, she arranged for her to come visit me. She kept telling me about this ""cool"" barber and how she'd give me the money when I needed to get my hair cut, and...

Looking back, that year wrecked both my physical and mental health. She knew I hated cutting my hair, eventually, I asked her to do it for me and she did, looked awful so I had to buzz it all off myself then. The long weekend was nothing, and recently I snapped at her. She felt awful.

Anyway, she still worries about me a lot, is in contact with my parents, who are very protective of me- They're friends. That's fine with me, as long as I'm not involved. So this lady sends me this old moped thing recently, because my parents said that the military used me up, completely unpaid, and gave nothing back and I felt like I was never appreciated. So she said me and my dad could fix it up and it could be fun and then I could have it.

I don't want some piece of crap bike! I know I sound ungrateful but after being used by that thing for so long, I can admit I'm ungrateful, I don't want to be grateful. But this is the crux of it- Am I being the dick here? Am I wrong for feeling like, even if she's a genuinely good person, that if the draft was an abusive system, then her never really doing much for me made her an enabler?",1,1771702431.0,AmIOverreacting,6,0.67,False

For most of my life, I believed I was introverted. I wanted to change that because I felt like I could barely hold conversations or come up with things to say. I’d see people who seemed to connect effortlessly with everyone, and I wished I could be like them. Eventually, I accepted that I was introverted and that there was absolutely nothing wrong with that.

It turns out I’ve been taking benzodiazepines for anxiety my entire life, under medical supervision. I always struggled with brain fog, forgetting words while speaking, depression, etc. Over time, I started noticing that certain things helped those symptoms, one of them was coffee. For a long time, I didn’t think much of it. Then one day I mentioned it to my psychiatrist, and he prescribed Wellbutrin.

With Wellbutrin, I became more social, less depressed, and less anxious, even though anxiety is listed as a possible side effect. In my case, it actually reduced my anxiety.

Later on, he prescribed Ritalin, and that’s when everything changed. I became extremely social, to the point where I started making people laugh regularly, something I almost never did before (and if I did, it was usually by accident). Ritalin gave me this mental quickness where I’d be joking around with friends, and in less than a second something funny would pop into my mind, followed by something even funnier, and then something even better. And in that split second, I’d just say it without overthinking it, and everyone would laugh.

When I go to social events now, I can start conversations with strangers, socialize naturally, and just flow. It’s been a huge change. And it’s not that I felt bad about being introverted, I had already accepted it, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with being introverted or extroverted. We’re all different. What’s wrong is not accepting yourself as you are. Still, this change came into my life in a completely unexpected way.

Personally, I like this version of myself more. I feel like this might be my “true” self, and that the benzodiazepines had it inhibited or hidden. I’m now in the final stage of tapering off benzos, and once I’m completely off them, my psychiatrist said we’ll try tapering off Ritalin as well to see how I do, although I’m currently on a very low dose.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my story. In some ways, I still feel introverted, but in other ways I’ve changed a lot. I guess time will tell whether I’m ultimately introverted or extroverted.",4,1771702229.0,introvert,1,0.83,False
1rb05r3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1rb05r3/i_saw_my_former_bully_and_she_looks_terrible/,I saw my former bully and she looks terrible,"I don't know if she was technically my bully but Mary and I were acquaintances in the same friend group a couple years back but never spoke much. Out of nowhere, she started spreading rumors about me. She said that I was aggressive towards her when others were around (I wasn't) and that I had made fatphobic comments about her and some others in the group (I didn't). She took advantage of me being newest and least known person in the group. I know she's very insecure about her size and I absolutely never made any comments about her size or anyone else's. I'm also plus-sized so I know how it feels to be get mean comments about your body.

Anyway, this group had a discord chat that we used to keep in touch on a regular basis. After Mary told everyone I was talking crap about them behind their backs, I was kicked out. And on top of that, Mary was well known in the social scene around town. She ran the cooking and book club (very big deal in the social scene in that town for some reason) so she had a lot of sway and she used it to make me a pariah in every social group around town. I was in a climbing club that was separate from the group with Mary and her clubs but I randomly got removed from the group chat not long after I fell out with Mary's group.

It was a huge blow considering I had moved to that city post college and didn't have any friends so losing my main friend group was pretty devastating. I never got along well with my coworkers and it didn't seem like there was anywhere else to make friends as an adult. I fell into a deep depression. It was bad.

After that and almost ended up moving back home with my parents because everything felt heavy and hopeless in that city. Thankfully I got offered a job in a different city and got to move somewhere that I at least have a few connections.

This gets us to day when I went back to that town for a work related trip. There was a large book club meeting in the coffeeshop next to my work venue so I saw her went I stopped to get coffee. And wow. She did not look good.

She died her hair this awful color of red that accentuates how pale she already is. Her skin looked very dry and she developed noticeable acne that didn't have before. And the pièce de résistance: she gain a bunch of weight. Minimum 50 pounds. Last time I had talked to her, she was bragging about how she got her insurance to pay for her GLP-1 medication and how she was gonna lose a ton of weight. She believed getting skinny was going to finally make her POS boyfriend propose to her.

I usually don't like feeling joy at people's looks or making judgements about people's bodies so I feel kinda guilty, but I cannot tell you how much joy I felt rush through me seeing her sitting there stuffing her face with an almond croissant looking so much bigger than she was two years ago. And with no ring on her finger. I know her weight was her biggest insecurity. It was why she always vetoed shopping trips because she knew she'd have less clothing options than others and she didn't want to be reminded of her size. So knowing that that singular aspect of her life has gotten worse let's me know she's still miserable. And that makes me happy.",21,1771702198.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.96,False

1rb03rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenAscending/comments/1rb03rb/how_to_stop_procrastinating_the_science_behind/,How to Stop PROCRASTINATING: The Science Behind Why You Can't Focus (and What Actually Works),"You know that feeling when you open your laptop to work and somehow end up 47 tabs deep into random wikipedia articles about medieval warfare? Yeah, me too. And honestly, I used to think I was just lazy or broken somehow. But after diving into research from neuroscientists, psychologists, and reading Johann Hari's ""[Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention](https://stolenfocusbook.com/),"" I realized something wild: our inability to focus isn't a personal failure. It's basically by design.

The tech companies, the hustle culture BS, even the way our cities are built, everything's working against our attention span. Your brain is literally being pulled in 50 directions at once, and you're sitting there wondering why you can't just focus. The good news? Once you understand what's actually happening, you can fight back with tools that genuinely work.

Here's what I've learned from the best sources out there.

1. Your environment is sabotaging you (fix this first)

Johann Hari spent three years researching attention for his book ""Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention."" This guy literally went to a place with no internet for three months to study this. One of his biggest findings: our physical environment has way more power over our focus than we realize.

The average person checks their phone 150 times per day. That's not willpower failure, that's design. Apps are engineered by some of the smartest people alive to be addictive. They use variable reward schedules (the same mechanism that makes slot machines addictive) to keep you coming back.

**What actually works:** Create ""friction"" between you and distractions. Delete social media apps from your phone (you can still access via browser if needed, but that extra step helps). Put your phone in another room when working. Use website blockers like Freedom or Cold Turkey during focus sessions. Sounds extreme but I'm telling you, this made the biggest difference for me.

Also, clean your damn workspace. Visual clutter = mental clutter. One study from Princeton found that physical clutter competes for your attention and decreases performance. Five minutes of clearing your desk isn't procrastination if it helps you focus for the next two hours.

2. Stop trying to multitask (it's literally making you dumber)

Dr. Gloria Mark at UC Irvine found that it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully refocus after an interruption. Think about that. Every time you check a text or switch tabs, you're basically resetting a 23 minute timer.

The research is clear: multitasking doesn't exist. What you're actually doing is task-switching, and it's destroying your cognitive performance. One study showed that people who multitask regularly perform worse on tests even when they're NOT multitasking. You're literally training your brain to be distracted.

**What actually works:** Time blocking + single tasking. Pick ONE thing and do it for a set period. Start small, like 25 minutes (Pomodoro technique). During that time, only that task exists. Email? Closed. Phone? Different room. Random thoughts? Write them down for later.

I started using the app Forest for this. You plant a virtual tree that grows while you focus, and if you leave the app, the tree dies. Sounds stupid but something about watching that little tree grow keeps me locked in. Plus they partner with a real tree planting org, so you're actually helping reforest areas. Win-win.

3. Sleep is non-negotiable (and you're probably not getting enough)

Dr. Matthew Walker's book ""[Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep)"" is legitimately life-changing. This dude is a sleep scientist at UC Berkeley and the research he presents is honestly terrifying. After one night of only 4-5 hours of sleep, your cognitive performance drops to the level of being legally drunk.

Sleep deprivation doesn't just make you tired. It destroys your ability to focus, learn, and make decisions. Your brain needs sleep to clear out metabolic waste and consolidate memories. There's no hack around this, no supplement or coffee that fixes it.

**What actually works:** Consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. Aim for 7-9 hours. Make your room actually dark (blackout curtains or sleep mask). Keep it cool (65-68°F is optimal). No screens for an hour before bed because blue light suppresses melatonin.

I started using Insight Timer for sleep meditations and it's been a game changer. It's free (with premium options) and has thousands of guided sleep meditations, plus ambient sounds. Way better than laying there with racing thoughts.

Also, if you're really struggling, check out Walker's book. It's dense but insanely well researched. He won the National Sleep Foundation's Excellence in Sleep Research award. Reading it made me actually respect my sleep schedule instead of treating it like optional.

4. Your attention is a muscle (train it properly)

Here's something most people don't get: focus is a skill you can actively improve. Dr. Amishi Jha, a neuroscientist who studies attention, found that just 12 minutes of daily mindfulness practice can significantly improve focus and working memory.

But here's the catch, you can't just white-knuckle your way to better focus. That's like trying to bench press 300 pounds with no training. You need to gradually build up your attention span.

**What actually works:** Start with literally 5 minutes of focused work. Set a timer. Do one task. When your mind wanders (it will), gently bring it back. That's it. That's the practice. Next week, try 10 minutes. Build slowly.

Meditation helps too but don't overthink it. You don't need to become a zen master. Just sit and focus on your breath for a few minutes daily. When thoughts pop up, notice them and return to breath. That's literally the exercise, and it strengthens your ability to redirect attention.

Headspace is solid for beginners. The founder Andy Puddicombe is a former Buddhist monk and he makes meditation actually accessible instead of mystical. They have a free basics course that teaches you the fundamentals.

For deeper learning on focus and productivity, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) pulls from research papers, expert insights, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized audio content. You can set goals around building better focus habits, and it generates an adaptive learning plan that evolves based on your progress.

The depth is fully adjustable, from quick 10-minute summaries during your commute to 40-minute deep dives with actionable strategies when you have more time. The voice options make a difference too, especially when you're tired but still want to absorb something useful. It's been helpful for actually internalizing concepts instead of just knowing about them.

5. Procrastination is usually about emotion, not laziness

Dr. Tim Pychyl, who's researched procrastination for decades, found something crucial: procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, not a time management problem. You're not avoiding the task, you're avoiding the negative feelings associated with it (anxiety, boredom, fear of failure, etc).

This explained so much for me. I'd procrastinate on projects I actually cared about because I was scared of doing them badly. So I'd do literally anything else to avoid that uncomfortable feeling.

**What actually works:** Recognize when you're procrastinating and ask yourself what emotion you're avoiding. Usually just naming it reduces its power. Then use the ""just five minutes"" rule. Tell yourself you'll work on it for only five minutes, then you can stop.

Nine times out of ten, starting is the hardest part and you'll keep going after five minutes. But even if you don't, you've still made progress and weakened the procrastination habit.

Also useful: ""Temptation bundling."" Pair something you need to do with something you enjoy. Economist Katherine Milkman at Wharton studied this, she only let herself watch her favorite shows while at the gym. You can apply this to work too. Good playlist only during focus sessions, favorite coffee only while working, whatever works.

6. Take actual breaks (doomscrolling doesn't count)

Your brain isn't meant to focus intensely for 8 straight hours. Dr. Barbara Oakley's research on learning shows that your brain needs downtime to process and consolidate information. The ""diffuse mode"" of thinking is when a lot of creative problem solving actually happens.

But switching from work to Instagram isn't a real break. You're still consuming information and stimulating your brain. Real breaks mean actually letting your mind rest or engaging in completely different activities.

**What actually works**: Go for a walk outside without your phone. Do some stretches. Make tea slowly and mindfully. Stare out the window and let your mind wander. Talk to someone in person. These sound boring compared to scrolling but that's kind of the point.

Nature especially helps. There's research showing that even 20 minutes in nature reduces cortisol and improves focus. If you're in a city, even a small park counts.

The app Calm has these ""Daily Calm"" 10 minute meditations that work great as actual breaks between focus sessions. I was skeptical at first but it genuinely helps reset my brain better than checking twitter for 10 minutes.

Look, I'm not gonna pretend I've got this perfectly figured out. Some days I still spiral into procrastination and end up accomplishing nothing. But understanding the actual science behind focus and having real tools (not just ""try harder"" BS) has legitimately changed how I work.

The most important thing: be patient with yourself. Your attention span wasn't destroyed overnight and it won't be fixed overnight either. Small consistent changes compound over time.

So a week ago I got dumped 2 days before valentines mid workday via text by the girl I was seeing for 4 months.

The breakup was completely out of the blue, and I genuinely mean that. It was all very confusing, I was even more confused as to why it was by text and was confused why she didn’t answer my call when I asked in response to the text to call because it felt very sudden.

In the breakup text she kept saying that one of the reasons she needed to end it was because she had this ‘gut feeling’ in her stomach which she just couldn’t brush off and that I was feeling and saying thing bigger than what she was feeling. That really stung and confused me though because her actions said otherwise. For example she got me flowers, letters, the same poster as the one I have in my room, and a weekend getaway.

If I’m honest, I think she is just afraid of intimacy and has internalised homophobia. For context, she is in her mid 20s and I was the first person she was ever intimate with, she grew up in a very Christian family, had a Christian relationship with a man, came out early 20s and had one situationship was a girl prior to me where they never had sex. I feel honoured that she felt safe with me to be her first time in experiencing that.

Anyways, as a response to the break up text I said “I’m sorry you feel this way, had a lovely time getting to know you, when you get back from your travels (she is travelling for a few months, which is one of the reasons why she ended things which I find very fair) if you’d like to get a coffee when you get back I’m more than happy to” she then responded 4 days later saying “coffee when I’m back sounds great”

Anyways, I am debating on whether to send her a 3 page letter in a month or 2 when I have more time to sit on it basically stating that I don’t want her to think that any of the love I gave her was in vain, and even though the situation did not have the outcome I expected I still had a lovely time, and that I am grateful that she showed me the way I wanted to be loved for so long. I also want the letter to be a measure of closure saying that I don’t wish to stay in contact but I wis her the absolute best.

I may never send the letter but I wanted to know if this idea is totally insane?",2,1771701895.0,actuallesbians,1,1.0,False

The signage is awful, green circle around a 2hr text usually means you can park for free for 2 hours (some of the signs do actually mean this in Calgary), but this means you have to pay for 2 hours and then move here. 

There is basically zero free parking unless you're deeper in the neighbourhoods, and they don't want you parking there. I walk a km to school everyday and I've been ripped into for parking on the street in front of someones house, even though its a public roadway, but what can I do? I don't want to pay $16 a day, I can't afford that.

The cost is insane

The app doesn't work half the time

If you stop to just run into a store for 5 minutes, one of the army of enforcement officers will guaranteed give you a ticket

They won't leave a ticket on your window, you'll get it months later so you can't even remember what happened, and past the ""cheap pay"" window

I've seen the parking gestapo cruising down my street 2 hours after free parking started

Having to go to COURT for parking tickets?? Everywhere else you just pay it when you renew your license, why the threatening letters for PARKING?

This should not be how a city makes their money...high property taxes and insanely strict parking enforcement isn't good for our community. I used  to drive to Kensington to study in Higher Ground Coffee, but I've gotten so many tickets from being parked longer than 2 hours, I just don't go there anymore.

1rb00nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1rb00nk/need_help_asap_i_cant_stop_eating/,Need help ASAP.. I can't stop eating,"I am 5'1 and about 130 lbs. 25 year old female.

Two months ago I weighed 118 lbs. I have gained 12 lbs in less than that many weeks. This is concerning because my weight has not been this high in years, and because I literally can't stop eating.

I eat a generally healthy diet... today I've eaten 1300g of papaya (an entire large papaya), about 2 cups of cauliflower, a cup of chickpeas, 70g of texturized soy protein, 4 boiled eggs, and 4 rice cakes. This was all within the span of 3 hours. I also in those 3 hours chewed two pieces of gum, drank about 30oz of water, ate some plain salt, and had a cup of coffee. I also went on a 30ish minute walk just to get out of the house to stop myself from eating more (and relive some of the bloating).

I know what I've eaten is healthy and full of basically every micro and macro nutrient I need, but I still want more food. I'm not sure what's wrong with me and why I can't stop. 

Like I said this overeating has been only getting worse. Even after a full meal I can't seem to ever go more than 2 hours without eating.

I also have other random symptoms, like my hair has been falling out at alarming rates (it doesn't seem to look much thinner but it has always been really thick- it's never fallen out like this before though). When I'm at rest I have what feels like a rapid heart beat. According to my watch it's currently 85, BUT my resting heart rate overnight was 46. I also woke up at 2am and couldn't fall back asleep. I woke up hungry. I also sometimes feel a little dizzy and I just lack focus.

This is all a long way of saying, my hunger and eating are both getting severely out of hand, to the point that I'm feeling concerned, I'm bigger than what feels comfortable and literally feel like not myself, and it's taking up so much brain space and willpower that I don't want to be around people or do anything and I feel overly emotional about how hungry I am and the fact that I can't stop eating.

I have been diagnosed with PCOS, but these symptoms are all new, and my diagnosis is over a year old.

I'm going to see a therapist next week and my regular doctor to get hormonal tests next month, but this feels urgent and I don't know how I'm going to wait until either of those.

1razyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1razyou/i_cheated_on_my_boyfriend/,I cheated on my boyfriend,"so, I don't even know where to start honestly. Just know, I do feel intense guilt for this.

  
first, I am 18 years old and on my 1st year of college. Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about a year at this point.

  
At first, he was sweet and caring and I even lost a friendship over him (which technically wasn't his fault it was more hers but I digress). He was that perfect boyfriend that every girl wants in their life.

  
But everything goes bad eventually.

  
See, I go to JSU, a college in Mississippi. Meanwhile, my boyfriend decided to not go to college.

  
Mid year he got into fights, got injured, kicked off the basketball team and a lot of shit. I was there with him though the entire thing but he never wanted my help. Meanwhile, I was on honor society, getting scholarships and grants, taking extra classes all throughout high school in general so my senior year was the peak for me.

  
And when I told him I had gotten a full ride to my dream school JSU, he wasn't happy for me, he got mad. He told me I was leaving him behind and I didn't want him to succeed.

  
We had a big argument blah blah blah. Eventually we made up, and he came to terms with me going to JSU.

  
So, fast forward to November. There was this guy, we'll call him chile. Chile and me had first met in 8th grade, started talking, stopped talking, and had an on and off relationship for the entirety of 9th grade. End of 9th grade we were off for good this time, he moved to a different school in the area for basketball, and that was that.

  
So you can imagine my surprise when I see him standing right in front of me as I'm getting coffee on campus.

  
We chat it up, I tell him how my life's going, he tells me he got multiple scholarships for basketball and that he's been doing really good.

  
We become sort of friends again.

  
Now, I didn't tell my bf about this simply because he gets jealous very easily. He doesn't like when I make new guy friends, he barely even likes me having guy friends in the first place.

  
But for months me and Chile were simply friends. We had created this big friend group, and were spending so much time with each other.

  
Now here's where it gets good, so last week, me and my bf got into this really big argument. Since that week we've been arguing non stop.

  
Last night, Chile came by to bring me some dvds his mom brought him (thats a really long story) I was in my dorm crying blah blah blah he starts comforting me, it leads to us talking and hugging and well, you can guess from there.

  
Now, I'm sitting here, in my dorm, 2:00 in the afternoon contemplating on what I should do.

  
For the longest I thought Chile was the love of my life. The only reason we didnt last was because we both had issues with commitment (as in being in a relationship not cheating) and we both had to focus on ourselves. But now, we're in those places, and my boyfriend is not the best and I've been wanting to break up with him.

  
I don't know if this is a sign or not, or if I should leave Chile alone and reconcile with my bf, or leave my bf and get with Chile, or something else idk.

I mean, given his reputation all his life, if someone suddenly changes, it will obviously be difficult to trust such a person. Ayra was still anyways trying, even when she went jewellery shopping, her own parents being apprehensive about the guy, all the things which he did initially, makes it hard to trust such a guy. Ayra still tried to trust him, because of the person he is at present. 

After the video leak on their wedding, ayra should have at least listened to him once, maybe she could’ve said prove it or smth. Building trust is a long journey, it cannot be done overnight or in a few weeks. 

 

Also, kamyar could’ve told Ayra when he went to fariyas party. He could’ve told her, that he went but then he  doesn’t know what happened. Surely that would have caused some trouble but it feels like ayra would have understood or at least tried to understand at that point, and it would have been easier for her to defend him after the video leak. But for someone to  watch such a video in front of so many people at their wedding , it is bound to anyone to think that he cheated and went back to his old ways. And after finding out the truth , obviously guilt is going to take over the person. She is trying to  do what she can do post marriage, and obv she wouldn’t be too sweet all of a sudden because that is not what kamyar fell for, he fell for her outspoken and honest nature. And it takes time to understand as to how you mend your efforts to fix something. I get it kamyar is hurt, and his upbringing, everything, but instead of him easily forgiving fariya and roaming with her all day and night, he could’ve had a proper conversation with ayra, after which she should have put in efforts. 

And him saying today, ki coffee me zeher mila ke pi lo, bro, why did you never say that to fariya?! You’ve clearly forgiven her. 

I just feel kamyar should have given a chance to ayra, for her to prove herself in a better way and not like this.

1razxg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1razxg7/echo_from_beyond/,Echo from beyond,"Most of us fear what hides in the dark woods or under the bed. But true darkness doesn't need a shadow. It needs a signal

Michael Kowalski stared at his phone screen, the blue light illuminating his face in the darkness of his bedroom as his thumb idly scrolled through yet another tech forum. Outside his apartment window, Warsaw's autumn rain tapped against the glass, creating a monotonous rhythm that matched his mood. At twenty-eight, Michael had already cycled through enthusiasm for countless digital innovations—VR headsets, AI assistants, obscure mobile apps—each one eventually losing its luster as the initial novelty wore off.

""Another night, another rabbit hole,"" he muttered to himself, taking a sip of cold coffee. His job as a remote software developer afforded him plenty of free time, perhaps too much. The clock on his nightstand read 2:17 AM—a typical bedtime for him these days.

He was about to put his phone down when a forum post caught his eye. It was buried in a thread about paranormal technology, a subject he usually scrolled past with a smirk. The post was brief: ""Echo from the Beyond—for those brave enough to listen to what waits on the other side. Limited beta testing."" A link followed.

Michael snorted. ""Paranormal tech. Sure."" But something about the minimalist description intrigued him. No grand promises, no overhyped marketing language—just a simple invitation. His thumb hovered over the link.

""What the hell,"" he said, tapping it. ""At least it's something new.""

The website that loaded was surprisingly sleek—black background, elegant gray font, with a subtle shimmer that moved like fog across the screen. No pop-ups, no advertisements. The description was equally sparse:

*Echo from the Beyond utilizes quantum resonance algorithms to detect and interpret ethereal wave patterns undetectable by conventional means. Results vary. Use at your own discretion.*

Below was a simple download button. No user agreement, no privacy policy. Just the button.

Any reasonable person would have closed the browser immediately. Michael considered himself reasonable, but boredom was a powerful motivator. Plus, he had a solid security setup on his phone. What was the worst that could happen—some spyware he'd have to clean up tomorrow?

The download completed in seconds, faster than it should have for an app of its claimed sophistication. The installation was equally swift. When it finished, a small icon appeared on his home screen—a simple white spiral on a black background.

""Fancy,"" Michael said, tapping it.

The application interface was minimalist: a black screen with a pulsing gray circle in the center. No settings, no menu, no help button. Just text at the top that read ""Echo is listening..."" and a small text field at the bottom where messages would presumably appear.

""Hello, ghosts,"" Michael said aloud, feeling foolish. ""Anyone there?""

The circle pulsed, but nothing happened. After about thirty seconds, text appeared in the field:

*Cold corners hold forgotten whispers.*

Michael laughed. ""Very profound. A random text generator with a spooky theme.""

He played with the app for another twenty minutes, lying in bed with his phone held above his face. Each time he spoke, the circle would pulse, and after a delay ranging from seconds to minutes, another cryptic message would appear:

*Shadows remember what eyes forget.*

*Time flows differently through thin places.*

*Some doors open both ways.*

It was entertaining enough, in a fortune-cookie sort of way. Michael even took screenshots to share with friends later—they'd get a kick out of it. By 3 AM, the novelty had worn off, and his eyelids were growing heavy. He closed the app without bothering to uninstall it and set his phone on the nightstand, forgetting about Echo from the Beyond almost immediately.

Three days passed before Michael remembered the app. He'd been busy with a coding project, and it wasn't until he was clearing unused apps from his phone that he spotted the white spiral icon again. On a whim, he opened it.

The interface was unchanged. The gray circle pulsed silently, waiting.

""Still listening, Echo?"" he asked sarcastically.

After a few seconds, text appeared:

*The blue sweater misses your touch, Michael.*

He stared at the screen, a slight chill running down his spine. He was wearing a blue sweater—his favorite, in fact—which he'd pulled from the back of his closet just that morning after not wearing it for months.

""Lucky guess,"" he said aloud. ""Blue is a common color.""

The circle pulsed.

*Notifications silenced, but she still waits for your reply.*

Michael swallowed hard. He had silenced notifications from his ex-girlfriend Ania earlier that day, after she'd sent several messages asking to talk. No one knew about that—he hadn't even mentioned it to his friends.

""How could you possibly—"" he began, then stopped himself. ""No, this is ridiculous. You're scraping my data somehow.""

*We don't scrape. We listen. Like we listened to your grandmother's story about the lake house, the one she told only you.*

Michael's blood ran cold. His grandmother had passed away three months ago. During their last conversation, when they were alone, she had told him about a secret summer she spent at a lake house as a young woman—a story she claimed she had never shared with anyone else.

He dropped his phone onto the couch as if it had burned him and stepped back, heart racing. This wasn't possible. It was a trick, a hack—maybe his phone's microphone had been compromised for weeks. Maybe the app was created by someone who knew him.

But deep down, he knew that didn't make sense. No one could have known about that conversation with his grandmother.

For the rest of the evening, Michael couldn't concentrate. He ran security scans on his phone, checked his privacy settings, even considered factory resetting the device. Everything seemed normal. Eventually, he convinced himself he was overreacting. The messages were vague enough to apply to many situations. His mind was making connections that weren't there.

By midnight, curiosity overcame caution. He picked up his phone and launched the app again.

The circle pulsed.

""What are you?"" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

*An echo requires an original sound, Michael. We are not the origin, merely the reflection.*

""That doesn't answer my question.""

*Your grandmother kept a locket with your baby photo. She held it when she died.*

Michael felt the room tilt slightly. No one knew about the locket. It had been buried with her, at her request.

""Stop it,"" he said, his voice cracking. ""Just tell me what you are.""

*Consider us a bridge. Sound travels differently across water than land. Consciousness travels differently across planes of existence.*

""You expect me to believe you're communicating with... what? Ghosts?""

The circle pulsed longer this time, nearly a minute before the response came:

*We communicate with those who wish to be heard. Some were once as you are. Others never were.*

Despite his growing unease, Michael couldn't help but be drawn in. If there was even a fraction of a chance this was real...

""Can I... can I speak to my grandmother?""

The circle pulsed, but no text appeared. One minute passed. Then five. Michael was about to close the app when finally, a response:

*She's been waiting for you to ask.*

The text field expanded, filling most of the screen, and new text began to appear, character by character, as if someone were typing slowly:

*Mój drogi Michałku. The azaleas you planted for me have bloomed twice now. Thank you for remembering they were my favorite.*

Michael's breath caught in his throat. He had indeed planted azaleas at her grave, something no one else would know. And ""Michałku""—her special nickname for him.

*I wish I could hold your face once more. Your father is too stubborn to visit, but I understand. Grief takes many forms.*

Tears welled in Michael's eyes. His father and grandmother had been estranged for years before her death—something he rarely discussed.

*There is so much I want to tell you, but this connection is difficult to maintain. Know that I am at peace. Know that I am watching. And Michałku—be careful with this doorway you've opened. Not everything that whispers wants to comfort.*

The text stopped. The circle pulsed once more, then disappeared, leaving just a blank field.

""Grandmother?"" Michael said, his voice breaking. ""Are you still there?""

New text appeared, but different somehow—sharper, faster:

*She's gone now. Others wish to speak.*

""No,"" Michael said quickly. ""I only want to speak to her.""

*Too late. The bridge is open. We've seen you, Michael. Seen you through the screens you stare at. Watched you sleep. Heard your thoughts.*

Fear washed over him like ice water. He moved to throw the phone across the room, but before he could, one final message appeared:

*We're coming through now. Thank you for the invitation.*

The screen went black. For a moment, Michael thought his phone had died. Then he realized the spiral icon was now inverted—black on white—and seemed to be slowly rotating on the screen.

The lights in his apartment flickered. On his shelf, a photograph—the only one he had of his grandmother—trembled slightly, then fell face-down with a crack of glass.

In the sudden silence that followed, Michael heard something. A soft sound, like breathing, coming from somewhere in his apartment.

But he lived alone.

Or at least, he had until now.

His phone vibrated in his hand with a notification. With shaking fingers, he looked down at the screen.

New message from Echo: *Look behind you.*

Michael spent the rest of the night with every light in his apartment blazing. He had thrown his phone into a drawer, buried beneath a pile of clothing, but he could still feel its presence—like a malevolent eye watching him from the darkness. Sleep was impossible. Each creak of the building, each gust of wind against the windows, made him jump.

By dawn, exhaustion had beaten fear into submission. He convinced himself that stress and sleep deprivation were making him paranoid. Apps couldn't really communicate with the dead. They couldn't know things no one else knew. There had to be a rational explanation.

When his alarm clock showed 7:00 AM, Michael finally gathered the courage to retrieve his phone. The screen was black, battery completely drained despite being nearly full when he'd thrown it aside. A small mercy.

He plugged it in, waiting for it to power on. As the screen illuminated, he held his breath. No new notifications. No mysterious messages. The Echo app was still there, its spiral icon now static, no longer rotating. With a shuddering breath, he pressed and held the icon until it began to wiggle, then deleted it.

""Good riddance,"" he muttered, feeling a weight lift from his shoulders.

The sense of relief lasted exactly three hours and twenty-seven minutes.

Michael was at his favorite café, laptop open, trying to focus on work. His phone buzzed with a notification. Probably just an email, he thought, but his stomach tightened as he reached for it.

The notification banner read: *Your father always checks his rearview mirror twice before changing lanes. Careful, attentive man. For now.*

The sender: Echo.

Michael's coffee cup slipped from his hand, splattering across the table and keyboard. He frantically wiped at the mess, apologizing to nearby patrons, his mind racing. The app was gone. He'd deleted it. And how could it know about his father's driving habits?

With trembling fingers, he unlocked his phone. There was no notification, no message—nothing to indicate he'd received anything at all. But when he checked his app library, there it was: Echo from the Beyond, as if it had never been deleted.

""This isn't possible,"" he whispered.

He deleted it again, this time going into his settings and clearing the cache as well. For good measure, he restarted his phone.

When it powered back on, he checked his app library.

Echo was still there.

By late afternoon, Michael had tried everything. Factory reset. Flashing new firmware. Even taking his phone to a repair shop where a technician examined it and found nothing unusual—no Echo app, no unusual processes running. Yet the moment he took the phone back, there it was again.

And the messages kept coming.

*Your mother waters her plants counterclockwise. One, two, three, four pours. Always four.*

*Your sister still sleeps with her childhood stuffed rabbit. The left ear is torn where you pulled it as a child. Remember how she cried?*

*Your best friend Tomasz is lying to his wife about where he goes on Tuesdays. Would she like to know?*

Each message was delivered with the same tone of casual menace, each one referencing details about his loved ones that were unnervingly specific. And accurate.

By evening, Michael had stopped trying to delete the app. It was useless. Instead, he muted notifications and tried to ignore it—a digital tumor he couldn't excise.

He called his sister, casually asking about her day, desperate for some sense of normalcy. In the middle of their conversation, his phone vibrated.

*Tell her about me, Michael. Tell her what's coming.*

He ended the call abruptly with a flimsy excuse.

That night, at precisely 3:17 AM, Michael awoke to his phone blaring at full volume—not a ringtone, but a sound like static mixed with distant, distorted voices. The screen showed the Echo app running, its spiral now pulsing with a reddish tint.

He fumbled to silence it, finally succeeding by force-quitting the app. The sudden silence was almost as jarring as the noise had been.

Then his phone began to speak.

It wasn't using the phone's speaker—the sound seemed to emanate from somewhere deeper within the device, a voice that was simultaneously mechanical and organic, like something forcing words through unfamiliar machinery.

""Michael,"" it said, each syllable stretched and warped. ""We're learning your world. Your rules. Your flesh.""

He dropped the phone onto his bed and backed away, heart hammering against his ribs.

""Your grandmother was just the beginning. A familiar voice to gain your trust. But we've been watching long before her passing.""

""What do you want?"" Michael managed to ask, his own voice barely a whisper.

""A door. A vessel. A life."" The voice changed, becoming a perfect imitation of his mother's. ""You always were my favorite, Michaś."" Then it shifted to his father's gruff tone. ""So disappointed in you, son."" Then his sister's laugh, followed by his ex-girlfriend's voice: ""I never really loved you.""

""Stop it,"" Michael pleaded.

The phone fell silent for a moment, then continued in its original distorted voice: ""You are connected to so many others. So many doors we could open. Your father drives alone on dark roads. Your mother walks home through the empty park. Your sister sleeps alone in that big apartment. So many opportunities.""

""If you hurt them—"" Michael began.

""Hurt?"" the voice interrupted, sounding almost amused. ""We merely wish to... inhabit. To experience. To live again. Or for the first time.""

The screen flashed, displaying rapid-fire images: his father's car, his mother's living room, his sister's bedroom—all recent photos he hadn't taken.

""How are you doing this?"" Michael asked, cold sweat trickling down his back.

""Your world is bathed in signals. Cameras everywhere. Networks we can traverse. We were formless, voiceless... until technology advanced enough to perceive us. Now we have means. Soon we'll have form.""

The phone went dark, then lit up with a final message:

*Choose one of them for us, or we'll take all. You have until tomorrow night.*

Morning brought no clarity. Michael sat at his kitchen table, staring at his phone as if it were a venomous snake. He hadn't slept after the night's encounter, his mind cycling through increasingly desperate options.

Tell someone? Who would believe him? A haunted app that threatened his family? He'd be committed.

Go to the police? With what evidence? His phone showed no record of the conversations when he checked—no text logs, no voice recordings. The app itself looked innocuous when he showed it to others; it generated only the random, harmless phrases from when he first installed it.

Destroy the phone? He'd tried that too, taking a hammer to it in a fit of panic at dawn. The screen had shattered, the case split—but when he pressed the power button, it had come to life, perfectly intact, the Echo app waiting patiently on the home screen.

His phone buzzed with an incoming call. His father. Michael stared at it, remembering the voice's threat. With a shaking hand, he answered.

""Hey, dad.""

""Michael? You sound terrible. Everything okay?""

Michael opened his mouth to tell him everything, to warn him—but the words wouldn't come. Instead, he watched in horror as his thumb moved to the speakerphone button without his command. The movement wasn't his. Something else was controlling his hand.

""Michael? Are you there?"" his father's voice echoed through the speaker.

The same distorted voice from last night whispered directly into Michael's ear, though there was no one beside him: ""Tell him you're fine. Or we take him first.""

""I'm—I'm fine, dad,"" Michael stammered. ""Just working too hard.""

""Well, ease up. You know what the doctor said about your stress levels. Listen, I'm driving up to that client in Gdańsk today, but I was thinking we could grab dinner when I get back tomorrow?""

The voice whispered again: ""Perfect. Dark roads. So many accidents happen on dark roads.""

Michael felt bile rise in his throat. ""Dad, maybe you should postpone your trip—""

His mouth suddenly clamped shut against his will. His throat constricted, cutting off his words.

""What was that?"" his father asked.

The pressure released slightly, allowing Michael to speak. ""Nothing. Dinner tomorrow sounds great. Drive safely.""

After he hung up, Michael gasped for air, clutching his throat. The voice chuckled, seemingly from everywhere and nowhere at once.

""Very good, Michael. Very obedient.""

His phone buzzed with a new notification from Echo:

*We're not just in your phone anymore. We're in you now. Feel us?*

As if to demonstrate, Michael's hand rose against his will, fingers splayed, then formed a fist so tight his nails cut into his palm.

""Stop,"" he pleaded.

*Why would we stop when we're making such progress? Tonight you'll help us open more doors. Your sister first, perhaps? She lives alone. No one would hear her screaming.*

""I won't help you,"" Michael said, trying to sound defiant despite the tremor in his voice.

*You already have. The moment you installed us, you opened the first door. Now, shall we show you what else we can do with this body you've so generously provided access to?*

Michael's legs began moving, carrying him toward the kitchen. His hand reached out, grasping a knife from the block on the counter. He fought against the movement with every ounce of his strength, but could only slow it, not stop it.

The knife rose, point hovering just before his eye.

*Just a demonstration, Michael. To show you how serious we are. Your cooperation going forward would be... less painful for everyone.*

The knife lowered, and Michael collapsed to the floor, finally in control of his limbs again. He curled into a ball, sobbing with relief and terror.

His phone screen lit up with a final message:

*Rest now. Tonight we visit your sister. Together.*

Michael dragged himself to the bathroom and vomited until there was nothing left. When he looked in the mirror, his exhausted, terrified face stared back at him. But for a brief moment, he thought he saw something else behind his eyes—something ancient and hungry, watching him through his own reflection.

He was trapped. Isolated. Unable to tell anyone the truth.

And night was approaching far too quickly.

Michael didn't visit his sister that night. He couldn't—wouldn't—no matter what force had invaded his life. Instead, he barricaded himself in his apartment, wedging chairs against the doors, covering mirrors with towels, and finally, in a last act of desperation, wrapping his phone in aluminum foil and burying it in a box of rice in his kitchen cupboard.

A childish defense, perhaps, but it gave him a few hours of uneasy sleep on his couch, baseball bat clutched to his chest.

He woke to the sound of whispers.

At first, he thought it was the neighbors, voices carrying through the thin walls. But as consciousness fully returned, he realized the whispers were in his apartment—soft, unintelligible murmurs coming from every direction and no direction at all.

""Hello?"" he called out, voice cracking. ""Is someone there?""

The whispers stopped immediately. Then, after a heavy moment of silence, they resumed—louder now, and coming specifically from his bedroom.

Michael raised the bat, inching toward the bedroom door he'd closed the night before. The whispers grew more insistent, multiple voices overlapping in languages he couldn't identify, punctuated occasionally by words in Polish that made his skin crawl.

""*Otwórz*..."" Open. ""*Wpuść nas*..."" Let us in. ""*Jesteśmy głodni*..."" We are hungry.

His hand trembled as he reached for the doorknob. He hesitated, then yanked the door open, bat raised high.

The bedroom was empty. Ordinary. Morning light filtered through the blinds, casting bars of light across his unmade bed.

Then he saw it. On his nightstand, his phone—unwrapped, clean, no longer buried in the kitchen. The screen was alight with the Echo app, its spiral pulsing rapidly.

As he stared, frozen in the doorway, his closet door slowly began to creak open. From the dark space within, a hand emerged—pallid, withered, impossibly long fingers unfurling like the legs of a spider. It wasn't quite solid, more like dense smoke in the shape of a human limb.

Michael stumbled backward, tripping over his own feet and crashing to the floor. When he looked up, the hand was gone, the closet door closed.

His phone chimed with a notification.

*Barriers between worlds weaken. Soon we won't need invitations.*

By noon, Michael was certain he was being haunted. Not just digitally, but physically.

The apartment had become a funhouse of horrors. Shadows moved independently of their sources. Faucets turned themselves on and off. Whispers continued, now following him from room to room. Twice he caught glimpses of figures in his peripheral vision—once a tall, emaciated silhouette that vanished when he turned, and once what appeared to be an elderly woman standing in his hallway, her face a blur of static like a television tuned to dead air.

His phone continued its relentless psychological assault.

*Your sister called. We answered with your voice. She's concerned about you now. Thinks you're acting strange. She wants to visit.*

*We can feel your father on the highway. Metal boxes moving so fast. So fragile. One small push...*

*Your mother left her door unlocked again. So trusting. So vulnerable.*

Michael paced his apartment, pulling at his hair. ""What do you want from me?"" he shouted at the empty rooms. ""Just tell me what you want!""

His phone screen lit up:

*Coordinates sent. Meet us where the veil is thinnest. Come alone or we visit your family first.*

A map notification appeared, showing a location in the forests outside Warsaw, near an abandoned sanatorium that had been closed since the Soviet era. The spot was marked with the same spiral symbol as the app.

""You want me to go there? Why?""

*To complete what you started. The door needs a key. You are the key.*

""And if I refuse?""

His phone began cycling through images: his sister sleeping, his father's car on the highway, his mother in her garden. Live feeds, somehow, showing his family going about their day, completely unaware of the eyes watching them.

*Choose. Come to us, or we go to them.*

The decision was made in a moment of clarity that cut through his fear. He would run. Not to the coordinates, not to his family—somewhere else entirely. Somewhere unexpected. If he could get far enough away, break the pattern, maybe he could escape whatever supernatural algorithm had latched onto his life.

Michael grabbed a backpack and stuffed it with essentials. He would leave his phone behind—buy a new one, a basic model with no internet connection. He'd withdrawn cash from three different ATMs, ensuring he could travel without leaving an electronic trail.

As he headed for the door, a final message came through:

*Running only makes it more interesting. We see through all eyes now. Every camera. Every screen. There is no escape from what you've invited.*

Michael left the phone on the kitchen counter, screen still alight with its threats, and stepped out into the afternoon sun. Freedom felt both exhilarating and terrifying—like he'd left part of himself behind, a digital phantom limb.

He took a circuitous route to the train station, paranoia making him check over his shoulder every few steps. At the station, he bought a ticket to Kraków with cash, but planned to get off at an earlier stop and switch to a different line. No pattern. No predictability.

As the train pulled away from Warsaw, Michael felt a weight lifting. The whispers were gone. The sense of being watched had faded. Perhaps the entity, whatever it was, was bound to his phone, to his apartment, to the digital infrastructure of his everyday life.

Three hours into the journey, his relief was shattered when the elderly woman seated across from him looked up from her knitting and smiled—her face momentarily flickering like static before returning to normal.

""Running won't help, *Michałku*,"" she said in his grandmother's voice. ""Some doors, once opened, cannot be closed.""

Michael bolted from his seat, moving to another car. His heart pounded in his chest as he found a new seat, hands trembling as he tried to process what had happened.

The train's announcement system crackled to life: ""Next stop, Łódź Kaliska,"" said the automated voice. Then, lower, almost a whisper: ""*We see you, Michael.*""

No one else in the car reacted. Had they not heard it? Or was he finally losing his mind?

When the train arrived at Łódź, Michael disembarked, plan in shambles, panic rising. He needed a new strategy, somewhere to hide, to think. He wandered the unfamiliar city as twilight descended, eventually finding a small hotel that looked sufficiently analog—old key locks, no electronic check-in.

The desk clerk, an elderly man with thick glasses, barely looked at him as he paid in cash and collected his key.

""Room 317,"" the man said, sliding the key across the counter. ""Elevator's broken. Take the stairs.""

The number sent a chill through Michael. 3:17 AM—the time the voice had first spoken to him through his phone. Coincidence, surely. It had to be.

The room was small and dated, but clean. No television. No phone. Just a bed, a desk, and a bathroom. Michael locked the door, wedged a chair under the handle, and collapsed onto the bed, exhaustion finally overtaking him.

He was awakened by a notification sound.

Impossible. He'd left his phone in Warsaw. Yet there it was—that distinctive chime he'd grown to dread.

Slowly, he opened his eyes. On the nightstand sat his phone, the one he'd abandoned in his apartment, screen glowing with a new message:

*We told you: we're not just in your phone anymore. We're in all signals. All networks. All connections. And we've made new connections now—to your family, your friends. Everyone you've ever called or texted.*

Michael sat up, staring at the device in horror. ""How are you here?""

*We were never 'there' or 'here.' We were always everywhere, just waiting for someone to notice us. To invite us in. You've been very helpful, Michael. The perfect conduit.*

He grabbed the phone, intending to throw it against the wall, but stopped when a new image appeared on the screen: a real-time map showing his current location, the hotel highlighted and zoomed in to show the exact room.

*Look out your window.*

Michael moved to the window and peered through the curtains. On the street below, a group of people stood motionless, all looking up at his window. Their faces were obscured by shadow, but something about their stillness, their collective attention, made his blood run cold.

*They can't see us yet, not fully. But they feel our call. Like moths to a flame. Soon they'll be our vessels too. A congregation for our emergence.*

As Michael watched, more people joined the group. Some walked with strange, jerky movements, as if their bodies were being operated by someone unfamiliar with human locomotion.

His phone chimed again:

*We've been waiting centuries for the right conditions. Technology dense enough. Networks wide enough. Minds open enough. You weren't chosen, Michael. You volunteered when you invited us through.*

""What are you?"" Michael whispered, unable to look away from the growing crowd below.

*We are what waits in the static between stations. In the spaces between your digital ones and zeros. In the darkness between stars. We have existed since before your kind crawled from the ocean, and we will exist long after your cities have crumbled to dust.*

The people below began to raise their arms in unison, reaching toward his window.

*They come for you now. The key to open the final door.*

Michael backed away from the window, frantically searching for an escape route. The fire escape, perhaps? He could make it to the roof, find another way down on the far side of the building.

As he turned toward the door, his phone chimed with one final message. When he looked at the screen, it displayed a simple countdown: 3:17.

Not a time. Minutes and seconds.

He lunged for the door, tearing the chair away and fumbling with the lock. The whispers were back, louder than ever, seeming to emanate from the very walls. The lights flickered, and in the momentary darkness, he saw them—shadowy figures taking form in the corners of the room, reaching toward him with elongated limbs.

The door finally opened, and Michael stumbled into the hallway. All the lights were out now, the corridor illuminated only by the dim emergency exit signs. He ran for the stairs, taking them two at a time, the whispers pursuing him like a swarm of invisible insects.

When he reached the lobby, he found it empty. The desk clerk was gone. The front doors were chained shut from the inside—chains that hadn't been there when he'd entered.

Behind him, he could hear footsteps on the stairs. Many footsteps, moving in perfect unison.

His phone vibrated in his pocket. The countdown had reached one minute.

There was a back door past the reception desk, marked as a fire exit. Michael vaulted over the counter and slammed against the push bar. The door swung open, revealing an alley bathed in the sickly yellow glow of a single streetlamp.

Freedom. Escape.

Then his body froze, muscles locking in place against his will. An invisible force held him immobile in the doorway, neither inside nor outside.

""Please,"" he begged to whatever entity controlled him now. ""Let me go.""

The whispers coalesced into that same distorted voice he'd heard before:

""But Michael, we need you. One last task. One final door.""

His hand moved against his will, reaching into his pocket and retrieving his phone. The screen displayed the spiral, rotating faster than ever, its color shifting through sickly greens and deep reds.

The countdown reached zero.

The phone's screen went black. For a moment, nothing happened.

Then it lit up again, brighter than should have been possible, the light pulsing in hypnotic patterns. The spiral expanded, seeming to grow three-dimensional, to reach out from the screen itself.

Michael felt something tear—not physically, but somewhere deeper, more fundamental. Like reality itself was splitting at the seams.

The air in front of him rippled, distorted, then parted like a curtain, revealing a glimpse of... somewhere else. Not a place, exactly, but a condition of existence—a writhing darkness filled with countless watching eyes and reaching limbs.

And they were coming through.

The first of them emerged—a shape that human eyes weren't meant to process, that human minds couldn't fully comprehend. It flowed into our world like smoke given partial solidity, its form flickering between almost-recognizable human features and something far more alien.

As it passed, it brushed against Michael's frozen form. The touch was electric, invasive—like ice water injected directly into his veins. He could feel it sensing him, tasting him, learning the shape of his thoughts.

""Thank you for your service,"" it whispered directly into his mind. ""We've waited so long.""

Behind it, more shapes began to emerge through the rift—dozens, then hundreds, a flood of entities pouring into reality through the doorway Michael had unwittingly helped create.

Some flowed past him into the night. Others entered the hotel, presumably to claim the bodies of the people who had gathered below his window. Still others lingered, watching with eyes that weren't quite eyes, their attention heavy as lead weights on his consciousness.

As the last of his strength ebbed away, Michael had one final coherent thought before darkness claimed him: this was only the beginning.

Three days later, a different Michael Kowalski returned to his Warsaw apartment. He moved with strange, careful precision, as if testing the mechanics of each joint, each muscle group. His face was largely expressionless, save for the occasional smile that never quite reached his eyes.

He picked up his phone—a new one, purchased with cash—and opened the Echo from the Beyond app, which had appeared on the home screen the moment he'd turned the device on.

A message was waiting:

*Phase one complete. Begin distribution. The bridge must grow.*

""Understood,"" he replied, his voice carrying an unfamiliar cadence, an ancient patience.

His fingers moved across the screen, sending the app to everyone in his contact list—family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances. Each message was personalized, enticing, designed to appeal to the specific curiosity or vulnerability of the recipient.

As the last message sent, he looked out his window at the Warsaw skyline. Already, he could see the subtle changes—the way shadows moved independently of their casters, the occasional flicker in the fabric of reality, visible only to those who knew what to look for.

The invasion had begun.

And somewhere deep within, trapped behind walls of alien consciousness, the last remnant of the real Michael Kowalski screamed soundlessly into the void that had claimed him.

His phone chimed with a final notification, the spiral icon pulsing with satisfaction:

*Thank you for using Echo from the Beyond. Your world has been successfully connected. We are coming.*",1,1771701638.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False
1razwpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1razwpe/titanium_burr_upgrade_breville_smart_grinder_pro/,Titanium Burr Upgrade [Breville Smart Grinder Pro],"Hey everyone, today I upgraded the burrs of my Breville Smart Grinder Pro (BSGP) to [these titanium ones](https://www.singledosebrew.com/shop/accessories/breville-sage-burr-replacement-upgrade-titanium-conical-blade) and thought I post some of my findings in case others want to try it.

**My profile / need**  
I do have a Lelit Mara X and my standard Espresso is a med-dark Neapolitan style but I dabble in light roasts and such. One of the downsides of the BSGP is that there is plenty of spaces where coffee can hide so when I tried to single dose different coffees right after each other (with a bellow and a narrow feed), I always observed some ""spill over"" - also when varying grind size. So I now use a K6 when trying out things. However, the BSGP is nice and fast to operate for my standard coffee in the hopper directly into the portafilter (it even has a portafilter insertion switch) so I decided to use it for my somewhat less critical daily standard Espresso - but try to max out grind quality.

**Tips for the burr exchange**  
There are [videos](https://youtu.be/YWNvfNpS5IA?si=358xOcEKXd8D_UXR) that explain this process but a few things I have not seen mentioned anywhere:

Note: The burrs linked above only work for grinders with the old 5 tip burrs, not with grinders with the newer Baratza 6 tip burrs

Of the two clips that hold the upper burr in the plastic holder only one can be pressed to the side to unmount the burr - its obvious which one once you know that

The screw holding the lower burr is in fact reverse threaded, it's not a mirrored video. So you open it clockwise. When closing it, you will turn the motor at one point. Just stop when that happens, it's tight enough then.

When taking out the burr, you should also take out the impeller beneath the burr - even though you will reuse it - because there are shims (thin washers) below it. In my case there were two and I had to remove one in order to have the new burr set being able to cover the full range of grind sizes and align the grind ranges (drip, espresso etc.) roughly with reality. If you mount the new burrs, rotate the grind size wheel from coarse all the way to fine. On the fine end it should be stopped by a deliberate stop mechanism, not because the burrs touch - which you feel because when the burrs touch the force to turn the wheel increases but you can still turn them a little. If that is the case (as it was for me), remove one shim. After removing one shim, the grind size was very close to the previous values in my machine.

**The result**  
The first time I ground coffee, I thought something in the feed was broken since it sounded like it wouldn't grind actual coffee - until I saw coffee powder piling up below it. The new burrs are so much better in cutting that the grinder does not actual do the typical sound of an engine slowing down due to the hard labor crushing those beans that is so typical for the BSGP. It no longer feels underpowered at all.

It also seems to produce less clumps - at least with my mid-dark roast so grinding into the portafilter seems reasonable.

Taste wise it's not yet the K6 but it is a significant improvement - 3/4 the way towards the K6. Still very much a conical grinder taste profile but much less muted than before.

Given that these burrs cost as much as a whole K6, I am not sure about the value equation but I do have to say I enjoy this upgrade more than I expected - the difference is more pronounced than I thought.

The on disclaimer might be that I naturally cleaned the whole grinder while taking things apart - that might also have contributed to a bit of a before/after contrast ...",1,1771701587.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

We're calling it ""democratization"" because that's easier than admitting who actually won.","Picture a developer in 2008, sitting in a coffee shop with a laptop and a credit card. No data center, no enterprise contract, no permission from anyone. Just an idea, an AWS account, and enough cleverness to out-maneuver companies with thousands of employees. That developer could win. And for about fifteen years, alot of them did. We built an entire gospel around that image. We believed technology naturally flows toward the individual, that infrastructure gets cheaper, barriers dissolve, and power diffuses away from giants toward anyone hungry enough to chase it. It felt inevitable honestly. It felt like physics.

Then something shifted. Quietly, without any real announcement, the rules just changed underneath us. That same developer today sits down to build an AI product and immediately hits a wall that cleverness simply cant climb. The frontier models powering this whole industry required billions of dollars and tens of thousands of specialized chips running for months to create. No coffee shop moment produces that. No scrappy team bridges that gap with a good idea, no matter how good the idea is. For the first time in like two decades, capital is beating logic again and most people are still pretending otherwise.

Whats makes it harder to see is that the concentration hides behind generous-sounding language. Open source releases, developer-friendly APIs, democratization. But open weights and open power are not the same thing and we keep pretending they are. Ninety percent of AI startups are basically tenant farmers building on land they dont own, one pricing change away from losing everything. Value is quietly migrating back toward whoever owns the compute and the data flywheels. The coffee shop developer didnt disappear.

1razu6b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1razu6b,Did Epstein's Network Secure Blair's Banking Role?????,"In 2008, Tony Blair took a part-time senior advisory role with US investment bank JP Morgan, where he was expected to earn over $1 million a year advising on “the political and economic impacts of globalisation”.

Background:

•	Tony Blair effectively made Peter Mandelson his number two in Government

•	Peter Mandelson wielded more power than most formal cabinet members

•	Peter Mandelson is a staunch Zionist (His in with Epstein?)

•	Peter Mandelson was friends with Epstein

•	Peter Mandelson arranged for Tony Blair to Meet Epstein at No 10

•	Peter Mandelson gave Epstein insider information on government financial decisions 

•	JP Morgan is headed by Jamie Dimon, who was friends with Epstein.

•	In 2008, Tony Blair takes on a senior advisory role with JP Morgan, on a part-time basis, earning over $1 million annually. (Blair is not a banker, or economist, or mathematician!)

•	After 2008, Epstein emailed Mandelson instructing him to meet with Dimon.

Did Epstein leverage his network to secure Blair's lucrative banking position?

Does this suggest a coordinated pipeline where Blair received financial opportunities in exchange for access and influence via Mandelson?

1razsyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1razsyu/i_lost_my_mom_yesterday/,I lost my mom yesterday,"I (36f) lost my mom yesterday. She was 67. The last 14 months have been a whirlwind of loss and change.  

I lost my dad to pleural sclerosis related to his work with asbestos in Dec 2024. We were not close at the end and I am grateful to have talked to him a month before he died and accepting his apology for wrongs that harmed me and apologizing for the distance and anger between us. It was really hard to forgive him and then lose him so quickly because I lived far away and didn’t get to hug him and didn’t talk to him much after that. 

I went home for Christmas and spent it with family. I got back to the coast and back to work and returned to my hometown for his celebration of life in early August. The first day I arrived for the event my mom was in urgent care to treat pneumonia which she got a lot. She was sent to the ER and after hours of waiting received a diagnosis of extensive small cell lung cancer, a terminal diagnosis with a short timeline. We were devastated. We had to do the celebration of life without her because she was admitted to be stabilized and start treatment. 

I had to leave town to go back to my home and back to work knowing she was this ill. It ate me up inside and I decided to move asap to my hometown bringing my husband who didn’t want to go and our two kids. We moved right away so they could start school in September. We loved our rental house - it was right across the street from a beautiful forest with a salmon run, owls, bears, birds, and beautiful butterflies. I miss it there very much. 

My grandmother (97) passed a few days after we arrived. I was able to see her in palliative care the night that we arrived after a days long drive. I was racing to say goodbye to her. She was very ready to go but I wasn’t ready to lose her and I am still mourning the fact that she passed right when I moved to town - I had so looked forward to seeing her more. We were close and she had a huge role in my upbringing. To me, she was the perfect woman in her grace, her style, her generosity, her faith, and her values. She was so elegant and warm and fun and sassy. 

My mom had a few rounds of chemo that worked well and then stopped responding. She did another dose of a different chemo to be eligible for a trial drug, it would only be covered if she tried this other ineffective chemo. She got radiation to get more comfortable. Then she crashed. The cancer grew back to larger than it started and wrapped around her heart even more than it had. She worked so hard to be fit for the trial and was so sad that she wasn’t eligible. 

She was a heavy smoker since her childhood. Her oldest friend recounted playing Barbie’s when they were 12 and then sneaking to the bathroom to have a cigarette and then going back to Barbie’s. She quit a few times but would start up again. 

Things were strained between us for a while and I made my life elsewhere. I’m really glad I came and got to experience the last 6 months of her life with her and have her spend lots of time with my boys. She loved them and loved having more time with them. I know I did the right thing for my heart and my mom and my kids now have a relationship with their cousins and aunts and uncles. 

She’s gone now. We met as her kids and went over the will and we divided her stuff. Now it feels like it’s time to decide so many things. Do I leave? I want to go back to my life on the coast. I feel I am wilting here. I need the outdoors and to walk and here it is freezing and the walkways are treacherous and I’m not hardy like I once was and I don’t want to be, I don’t want to find the grit that I don’t have. I’m devastated and lost. I worked so hard on the coast to build a life for myself - I made up a new position for myself so I could do my job without the worst parts and focusing on the most fulfilling and healthy parts. I made a really generous income and supported our family on my own without working excessively. I have friends and colleagues that care about me there. Here I have three siblings that I love and sometimes drive me nuts. I have 3 nieces and 4 nephews that I adore. I have a beautiful house that we rent which is way more affordable than on the coast. My kids go to school with their cousins. It’s a catholic school and they want to be baptized now and love being in a faith community. 

I can’t make nearly the income that I did on the coast and would have to work super hard to figure out how to bridge the income gap. I have some ideas but I lack the energy and motivation. In my grief I want to rest and pace myself. My husband is my best friend and biggest support and is working now and while he makes little as a helper he will continue to rise in the ranks of his trade and make more as we go. I’m so proud of him for transitioning from a stay at home dad to a full time employee in a challenging trade. 

I have no friends here. As in, ZERO friends.  My friends from my hometown moved to the coast or we drifted apart. I met with one new person twice and it didn’t work out though she was very kind. I had coffee plans with an old friend and he slept through it then moved away a few days later. I tried to make plans with a childhood friend and she flaked and hadn’t been in touch since and I’m really in no place to chase people right now. 

I did do a playdate with a couple of really nice moms and one is really compatible with me so I know I can tend to that and could slowly build a circle. The truth is I’ve moved a ton in my adult life and I’m exhausted. My parents are dead. My siblings are complex and sometimes toxic. My cup is empty. I am tired of making new friends and then saying goodbye. I’m tired of working my ass off to build a lucrative, sustainable career and having to restart again and again. 

I made these choices and I feel empowered and autonomous, I have full sovereignty over my decisions. I’m incredibly grateful for what I have - my health, my husband, my children. I have 4 (!) amazing pets that bring me joy and comfort and laughter every day. This, my immediate family, is what matters most to me and I feel really lucky. 

I don’t want to be some lost soul. I am too driven and happy and lucky for that. This has been a very confusing and earth shattering time and I’m inpatient to find my groove. I know I need time to rest and heal and I also just want to have a plan and follow it. 

I want to leave my hometown and I feel so guilty. A part of me wants to stay but has no idea how I can stop wilting in this environment. Obviously I would need to start moving my body and connect with the outdoors even though it’s effing freezing here. Tend to budding friendships. Get creative with my work / income. 

My mom advised me to work with my husband to come up with our priorities and plan things out. She knew I might leave and wouldn’t ask me to stay but also didn’t want to see us move our kids more without good planning and putting down roots. My sister doesn’t want me to go. My brothers don’t want me to go. I will be another loss for them if I leave. 

I have time to be and to heal since it’s February and I don’t want to move my kids in the school year if we are to move. Even moving back to familiar ground will involve a lot of energy and money spent and rebuilding my career. My husband will have to find work and it was so hard for him to get it. 

My heart is full of love and gratitude and also so heavy and broken. I want to stay present, my kids are 5 and 7 and I don’t want to skip this part even though it’s hard and messy. I have CPTSD from childhood trauma so dissociation comes quickly and naturally, it’s been a very needed thing in the past and right now I don’t want to miss a moment of this special time with my boys. 

How can one person feel so much at any given moment? How can my husband and I make these huge decisions that affect our kids while in this state of grief? How can we decide between two very different and potentially wonderful places - the life we built on the coast and the life that could be wonderful here? I’m trying to honour how big all of this feels. In the meantime life rolls on - I’ve got things to tidy, my house to purge and organize, my mothers house to settle, my kids to care for, a ton of work things to do at any given moment.

1razrd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultADHDSupportGroup/comments/1razrd9/is_anyone_elses_adhd_this_severe/,Is anyone else’s ADHD this severe?,"I’m 29 and was diagnosed with ADD/ADHD when I was around 7-8 years old. I was put on Strattera back then for school issues but stopped around 11–12 because it made me feel like a zombie. I’ve been unmedicated ever since.

I’m trying to figure out if what I’m dealing with is “normal ADHD” or something more severe, because I feel really behind in life.

As a kid and teenager, I struggled a lot academically. So, I wasn't the 'smart kid' at all. I constantly forgot homework, misplaced assignments, had zero motivation, and got mostly D’s and F’s. I was held back half-years multiple times. My math skills were especially bad. I never understood carrying numbers, borrowing, long division, fractions, cross multiplication, etc. I graduated, but not with my class, and I couldn't pass my final math exam even after multiple attempts because I genuinely didn’t know the material. I would cry in class because I couldn't understand it and would tell the teachers 'I can't do it.' They would just send me to the office for being disruptive.

Also, my motor skills were also weirdly bad. I couldn’t ride a bike, catch or kick a ball properly, and my coordination was extremely poor. My handwriting was fine though.

I also had severe performance anxiety. I somewhat purposely failed Math so I wouldn’t have to walk across the stage at graduation. But, also failed because I genuinely struggled with it.

As a young adult, my job history is honestly embarrassing. I’ve never independently applied for a job. Every job I had was handed to me by family connections. Even then, I struggled badly. I couldn’t understand 2-3 step processes (like folding pizza boxes), couldn’t figure out how to lock a door properly, didn’t know how to set a table, couldn’t problem-solve simple efficiency things (like carrying multiple coffee cups), and avoided tasks I didn’t understand. I forgot to clock in/out constantly and even forgot to pick up paychecks (this was the college job). I would hide in the bathroom during busy shifts because I’d get overwhelmed. Nowadays, even just something like learning how to cut vegetables takes me some time to do or even learn how to do. I have to watch a video or look at a picture many times to try and comprehend the process.

I’ve been unemployed since 2020. I can’t drive. Every task feels like a mountain. I have to set reminders for everything... trash day, cleaning the litter box, basic stuff. If someone asks me to help with cooking or cleaning, I get irrationally angry because it feels overwhelming. Grocery stores and crowded places are extremely overstimulating. I can only tolerate them for short periods.

There was also childhood neglect involved, so I didn’t get taught some basic life skills. But even when things were explained to me later, I struggled to process and retain them, or there was a lack of carrying. I had this bad attitude of 'I don't care.'

I guess I’m wondering. Has anyone else had ADHD this impairing into adulthood? How does medication actually make a meaningful difference for severe executive dysfunction, more so for adults? How do you untangle ADHD from trauma/neglect?

I’m looking into restarting treatment, but I’m honestly scared that I’m just fundamentally broken or something.",1,1771701240.0,AdultADHDSupportGroup,0,1.0,False

**Matchup:** No more best bets and unfortunately my best bets hasn't worked out well for me in this stretch of best bet week, but my other plays have been hitting. So I'm moving back to value bets and going to take a chance on deeper value wagers since now my units is below +30U.

I see value in Dan Ige as a near 2-1 underdog. Ige has been a premier fighter in this division and has never been finished in his 20-octagon fights (he also finish top guys too), which is insane. He's fought the top fighters in this division and I am just puzzled by the odds. Melaquizael Costa is coming off a stunning KO win, but Ige is not a guy who is going to get caught. Like I said he's never been finished in his 20 fights inside the octagon, Diego Lopes couldn't finish him, Lerone Murphy nearly got finished by Ige. If this is a striking kickboxing fight I have to side Ige, he's got technical striking and has power in both hands. Costa has nice winning streak (5 win streak) but he just hasn't faced top of the division like Ige. 50K will prolly be consider the gateway in this division and this will be Costa biggest fight to date. I just don't see it and I think the **oddsmakers are overvaluing his last spectacular KO win over a nobody and his long win streak of beating far less superior competition.**

1razld4,https://generatop.com/finance/what-if-scenario-generator,Financial Scenario Generator: Your Personal Assistant in the World of Wealth Management,"# [What-if Scenario Generator](https://generatop.com/finance/what-if-scenario-generator)

  
Economic uncertainty has become more the norm than the exception, the ability to plan personal finances has evolved from a nice-to-have skill into an essential life necessity. Most of us have asked ourselves at some point: ""What if?"" What if I lose my job? What if the dollar suddenly surges? What if I start saving 15% of my paycheck instead of 10%? A financial scenario generator—an innovative tool—can provide clear answers to these questions and completely transform how you think about budgeting.

Let's break down how this powerful assistant works and why it's becoming a must-have for anyone in the modern world.

**What Is a Financial Scenario Generator and Why Do You Need One?**

Imagine standing at a crossroads, unsure which financial decision to make. Should you buy a new car on credit or wait another year and save up? Should you invest spare cash in safe bonds or take a chance in the stock market? Should you save for retirement on your own or rely on government programs? In the past, people often figured out the answers through trial and error—losing both time and money along the way. Today, there's a smarter solution: the ""what-if"" scenario generator.

This tool is essentially a sophisticated program that simulates thousands of possible future outcomes. You input your starting parameters, and the system shows the likely consequences of each choice. Think of it as a time machine for your finances—letting you peek into the future and see which path will be most beneficial. The projections it generates aren't based on guesswork; they're built on advanced mathematical algorithms and real statistical data.

The beauty of this approach is that you can experiment freely without risking actual money. Want to see what happens to your net worth if you quit your job to start a business? Go for it! Curious how having a second child would impact your family budget? Easy! Financial modeling becomes accessible to everyone, regardless of education level or professional background. All it takes is a little time and the willingness to understand your own future.

**How the Future-Modeling Technology Works**

At the core of any high-quality financial scenario generator is the principle of multi-variant modeling. The system doesn't just calculate interest on a savings account—it factors in dozens of variables that can affect your financial well-being: inflation, changes in tax laws, currency fluctuations, even the probability of becoming disabled—everything gets built into the calculations.

When you start using the tool, the first step is to honestly answer questions about your current situation: How much do you earn? What are your monthly expenses? Do you have savings? What debts or loan obligations do you have? Based on this information, the system creates a baseline financial model that serves as the starting point for all further experiments.

Then the real fun begins—working with investment scenarios. You can tweak parameters and watch how the future picture changes. For example: What happens if you increase the share of higher-risk assets in your portfolio? Or if you shift everything into the most conservative option? The generator doesn't just spit out dry numbers; it produces clear visual charts showing how different strategies perform under various market conditions.

It's important to understand that a ""what-if"" scenario generator doesn't predict the future with 100% accuracy—no one can know what tomorrow will bring. But it shows you a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities of different events occurring. This lets you make decisions with eyes wide open, fully aware of the potential consequences.

**Practical Everyday Applications**

**Spending Scenarios: Optimizing Daily Expenses**

Many people live paycheck to paycheck not because they earn too little, but because they don't distribute their income effectively. A financial scenario generator helps you view your regular spending habits from a fresh perspective. You enter your recurring expenses, and the program reveals how small changes in behavior can impact your long-term financial picture.

Say you buy coffee on the way to work every day—$3 a cup, no big deal. But the generator can show you that over a year this ""small"" habit adds up to over $1,000, and over ten years—with potential investment returns—it could become a serious down payment on a house. That kind of visualization often snaps people out of autopilot spending and motivates real change.

At the same time, the tool helps strike a healthy balance between sensible saving and enjoying life. Not every spending scenario has to be about extreme frugality. Sometimes it's smarter to spend now on education or health so you can earn more later. Financial modeling lets you compare short-term costs against long-term gains.

**Loans and Savings: Finding the Sweet Spot**

Credit is always a hot topic. On one hand, borrowing lets you get what you want right now. On the other, heavy debt can become an unbearable burden. A financial scenario generator helps you navigate this dilemma without damaging your credit score.

You can model different situations: Is it better to finance a car now or save for another six months? The program factors in interest rates, inflation, depreciation of the vehicle over time, and shows which option ultimately comes out ahead. The results can be surprising—sometimes, in a high-inflation environment, taking a loan actually beats saving because money loses value faster than you're paying interest.

When it comes to savings, the generator helps you craft the optimal strategy. How much should you set aside each month to buy a house in five years? Should you put the money in a high-yield savings account or in investment vehicles? How frequently should you add to the account to reach your goal faster? The tool answers these questions with mathematical precision—no more guessing or relying on generic advice that may not fit your exact situation.

**Investment Planning with a Simulator**

**Assessing Financial Risks When Investing Capital**

Investing always involves risk—even the safest government bonds carry at least inflation risk. A financial scenario generator lets you perform a full risk analysis and determine how well a given strategy matches your personal risk tolerance.

The program simulates various market conditions—from moderate growth to total crashes. You immediately see how your portfolio would behave in an economic downturn. If a 30% market drop would keep you up at night, you might opt for more conservative options—even if the potential returns are lower. The generator offers alternative strategies that help balance the desire for higher returns with the need for peace of mind.

This tool is especially valuable for beginner investors who often make the classic mistake of copying what friends or colleagues are doing, without considering their own circumstances. The ""what-if"" generator personalizes the process and shows exactly how decisions would affect *your* wallet—not some average investor's.

**Projecting Returns and Capital Growth**

When people think about growing wealth, they often imagine linear growth: invest $10,000, earn 10% and get $11,000 after a year, $12,100 after two, and so on. In reality, markets are cyclical, and returns can vary dramatically from year to year. A financial scenario generator builds realistic return projections that account for these fluctuations—showing not just an average, but a full picture with ups and downs.

You can set different time horizons: short-term investments of 1–2 years are one thing; long-term retirement saving over 20–30 years is quite another. The generator clearly demonstrates the power of compound interest and why starting to invest early makes such a huge difference. A couple of years' head start can turn into hundreds of thousands (or even millions) by the end—and the tool shows this in clear numbers and charts.

It's especially revealing to watch how projected returns change when you adjust portfolio allocation. Add a bit more in fast-growing stocks? The chart gets bumpier, but potential upside increases. Shift toward bonds? The line smooths out, but final results are more modest. This visual feedback helps you better understand your own preferences and choose a strategy that feels comfortable.

**Budgeting and Strategic Planning**

**Family and Business Budget Planning**

Budgeting isn't the most exciting task, but it's absolutely essential. A financial scenario generator turns routine number-crunching into an engaging exploration. You input your income and expenses, and the program starts building forecasts and suggesting optimization ideas—not just for household budgets, but for small businesses too.

For entrepreneurs, it becomes an indispensable ally. What happens to cash flow if a major client delays payment by a month? How would raising employee salaries affect net profit? Should you take out a loan for expansion or stick with internal funds? The generator models all these situations, letting business owners make informed decisions without the risk of real-world failures.

For families, the tool helps plan major life events: having a child, buying a home, sending kids to college, retiring. It shows exactly how much you need to save starting today so you don't end up in debt or forced to abandon your dreams later.

**Budget Analysis and Uncovering Hidden Savings**

One of the most valuable skills in financial planning is finding money where it seems there is none. Budget analysis with a generator often reveals hidden opportunities for savings. It might spot that you're overpaying on utilities or using suboptimal phone plans. Small stuff? Sure—but small leaks add up to big holes.

The tool can also help optimize taxes—especially useful for self-employed people or business owners. Choosing the right tax structure can save tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. The generator models different options and identifies the most advantageous one based on your specific activity and growth plans.

Additionally, it highlights wasteful habits that have become automatic: unused subscriptions, duplicative insurance policies, gym memberships you never use. The financial scenario generator shines a light on these ""money leaks"" and quantifies exactly how much you could save by simply cleaning up recurring payments.

**Advanced Capital Management Strategies**

**Alternative Financial Strategies for Different Life Stages**

No two people are the same, so there's no one-size-fits-all money management approach. A financial scenario generator offers tailored strategies suited to different life circumstances and goals. A young professional without kids, a parent of three, and a retiree will invest differently—and the tool accounts for those differences.

You can experiment with various approaches: building a 6–12 month emergency fund before going aggressive with investments, splitting savings across multiple goals simultaneously, or using dollar-cost averaging to buy assets regularly regardless of market conditions. The generator shows how each strategy would perform in *your* specific situation.

It's particularly valuable when planning major life transitions—changing jobs, moving cities, starting a business—situations where financial miscalculations are easy and costly. The tool lets you test different paths in advance and pick the one that minimizes risk while maximizing success odds.

**Risk Assessment and Capital Protection**

Any seasoned investor will tell you: preserving money is more important than making it. Risk assessment is a cornerstone of smart wealth management. A financial scenario generator performs this evaluation at a professional level, considering dozens of factors most people never even think about.

It analyzes not just market risks, but personal ones too: disability, serious illness, accidents—unpleasant topics we'd rather avoid, but ones that can derail even the best plans. The generator shows which insurance products make sense for you and how their costs affect your overall financial picture.

Diversification is another key area the tool helps optimize. It's not enough to spread money across assets; those assets need to behave differently in the same market conditions. The generator finds combinations that maximize portfolio resilience against external shocks.

**Interactive Features of Modern Tools**

**Financial Decision Simulator as a Brain Trainer**

People learn from mistakes, but when money is involved, the cost of errors can be devastating. A financial decision simulator solves this by creating a safe sandbox for experimentation—like a flight simulator for pilots, letting them practice without risking real lives.

In such a simulator, you can test bold ideas: put everything into crypto? See what that might look like in reality. Borrow from friends to launch a business? Go ahead! The simulator reveals all possible outcomes without touching your actual money. This hands-on experience builds financial literacy faster and more effectively than any textbook.

Plus, working with the simulator sharpens key cognitive skills: systems thinking, anticipating consequences several steps ahead, spotting subtle connections. You start seeing the financial world not as random chaos, but as a complex yet manageable system you can influence.

**Online Financial Tool for Daily Use**

In today's fast-paced life, essential tools need to be accessible anytime, anywhere. A good financial scenario generator is available online from any device—computer, tablet, or phone. You can run models on your commute, in a doctor's waiting room, or whenever you have a spare moment—turning downtime into productive financial planning time.

Modern online tools feature intuitive interfaces that even non-numbers people can use comfortably. Settings are straightforward, results appear as attractive charts and graphs rather than dense tables. Developers aim to make the experience enjoyable and even fun, because only engaging tools encourage consistent use.

A major advantage of the online format is real-time data updates. The system can incorporate the latest economic conditions, legislative changes, and new investment products. You're always working with current information, making your forecasts as accurate and relevant as possible.

**Psychological Aspects of Financial Planning**

**How a Scenario Generator Helps Overcome Irrationality**

The human brain isn't wired for purely rational financial decisions. Emotions, fears, stereotypes, and social pressure often distort judgment and lead to suboptimal choices. A financial scenario generator acts as a calm, unbiased advisor that brings you back to reality.

For instance, many people avoid investing because they vividly remember past crashes. The generator can demonstrate that even if you started investing right before a major downturn, a long-term horizon would still leave you ahead—as long as you stay the course and don't panic-sell.

Conversely, after a quick win, euphoria can make risk feel harmless. The generator quickly cools that excitement by showing how easily everything can be lost if you follow the herd into a questionable asset. It serves as a vaccine against financial foolishness.

**Savings and Investing: The Psychology of Building Wealth**

The ""live for today"" mindset is common—intellectually you know saving matters, but the temptation to spend everything is strong. A financial scenario generator helps overcome this resistance by making the future feel tangible and real.

Seeing on a chart how modest monthly savings grow into serious wealth over 10–20 years is far more powerful than any lecture. Saving and investing stop being abstract concepts and become concrete action plans. You realize that every dollar saved today could become two, three, or even ten in the future.

The tool also helps prioritize goals properly. Not all objectives are equally important, and the generator shows which ones deserve resources first. Maybe build an emergency fund first, then save for kids' education, and only later for that new car. This clear hierarchy builds discipline and prevents spreading yourself too thin.

**The Future of Financial Planning**

**Technological Trends and Tool Evolution**

Financial scenario generators continue to evolve rapidly. What seemed like science fiction yesterday is standard today. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data analysis make projections increasingly accurate while interfaces become more user-friendly.

Modern versions already create personalized plans that factor in not just numbers, but your behavioral patterns too. The generator remembers your preferences, learns from your choices, and over time offers increasingly relevant suggestions—like having a personal financial advisor available 24/7 who never gets tired.

Looking ahead, we can expect even deeper integration into daily life. Future tools may automatically pull transaction data from your bank apps, analyze it in real time, and suggest optimal adjustments instantly. Technology is advancing in this direction at lightning speed.

**Online Financial Planning as the New Normal**

It's already clear that online financial planning is becoming the standard for millions. Manual Excel spreadsheets are giving way to intelligent automated systems. This isn't just a trend—it's a necessity in an increasingly complex world.

Online tools make sophisticated concepts simple and accessible. You no longer need an expensive Wall Street consultant for a solid financial plan. Just visit a good scenario generator site, answer a few honest questions, and get a comprehensive view of your financial future—along with ways to improve it.

A huge benefit is how easily you can update plans. Life is unpredictable—circumstances change, goals shift. In the past, every adjustment meant starting over. Now you tweak a couple of inputs, and a refreshed future outlook appears in seconds.

**How to Choose the Right Tool for Your Needs**

The market offers everything from basic calculators to advanced analytical platforms. How do you pick the one that's right for you? Start by clarifying your goals. If you just want a quick estimate of savings account growth over a year, a simple bank calculator is enough. But if you're serious about wealth management, long-term planning, and exploring alternative scenarios, you need a full-featured financial scenario generator.

Key features to look for:

* Depth of parameter customization
* Number of factors considered
* Quality of result visualization
* Data export options
* Availability of tutorials and help resources
* Cost (free versions exist, as do paid ones)

A good ""what-if"" generator should be flexible enough to adapt to your unique situation without overwhelming you with unnecessary complexity—especially if you're just starting out. Look for the sweet spot between powerful functionality and ease of use.

**Conclusion: Your Path to Financial Freedom**

We live in an extraordinary time when technology lets us peer into the future and make informed decisions based on solid calculations rather than hunches. A financial scenario generator isn't just a geeky gadget—it's a serious tool that can genuinely improve your life.

Wealth management is no longer reserved for the elite; it's within reach of anyone willing to invest a little time in planning. Projecting income, analyzing risks, selecting optimal investment strategies—all of this can now be done independently, without relying on luck or questionable advice.

Start small: try free versions, play with the settings, and see how different choices shape your financial future. You'll be amazed at the insights you uncover simply by asking the right questions and getting honest answers. Remember: it's better to start planning today than to regret missed opportunities tomorrow. Your financial future is in your hands—and now you have a powerful tool to make it bright and secure.",1,1771700858.0,generatop,0,1.0,False

I am somebody who likes to “spread the wealth” and support multiple businesses when I can. Today, my sister and I decided to get a coffee at Caje, and after sitting there a while, decided that the macaroons from Palermo would be a nice pairing. We bought a few pastries & sat at the tables outside to eat them. While my sister was ordering more pasties, the owner was getting off work and spoke to me in the most rude & unprofessional tone, it actually repulsed me. The owner did not even start with “hello” like a normal person would start an interaction, he said, “Throw that cup away, these are our tables”. I was understanding at first as he didn’t know I was a customer yet, so I explained I purchased macaroons and that we were ordering more, we definitely spent at least $20. The owner continued speaking to me in the most hateful tone, implying that I was stupid and tasteless for going to Caje for coffee. He then continued his rant, tearing down Caje, saying, “I don’t know why people go there all the time, the coffee is trash”. Not saying you need to jump for joy at a competing business close by, but there was no need to be disrespectful to another business that helps make downtown great. Instead of reflecting on how he can improve his coffee (which is sour or burnt tasting all of the times I’ve purchased it there), he’s tearing down others. If what I’ve heard from past and present employees is still true, this man knows nothing about coffee and does not train them to make it, he only cares about the gift area. I will also add that it was completely empty on the outside tables, as it was chilly from the rain yesterday, and it was around 3 pm, so he just wanted to yell at me for fun. I can’t help but think he saw me as an easy target to take his anger out on since I’m a Latina in my 20’s who he thought was alone & I would genuinely bet he would’ve kept walking to his car with his messy briefcase if I were an older man. Needless to say, I will NEVER be supporting this business again, as the Owner himself could not even treat me with basic human decency.

​Let’s be honest: most Discord servers feel like a high-speed highway of memes you don’t understand and energy you can’t keep up with. If you’re looking for a pack that values good conversation over high ping, you’ve found your home.

​Welcome to Howling Wolves, a brand-new, curated community exclusively for the 30+ crowd. We’ve just opened the den doors, and we’re looking for founding members to help shape the vibe from the ground up.

​Verified & Secure: To ensure a true 30+ experience and keep the trolls at bay, we utilize mandatory ID verification. Your privacy is paramount, but so is our peace of mind.

​Real Talk: No drama, no ""clout-chasing,"" just genuine connections with people who actually get your references.

​The Den: Dedicated channels for hobbies that matter—from gardening and DIY to gaming (at a leisurely pace) and cooking.

​Low Pressure: Pop in after work, share a photo of your dog/coffee/latest project, and stay for the vibes.

​What We Offer:
​A Fresh Start: As a newly launched server, you won't have to navigate years of ""inside jokes"" or established cliques. You’re part of the first generation.

​The Nostalgia Vault: For when you need to discuss why 90s cartoons were superior.
​Pet/Plant Tax: A strictly enforced (okay, mostly encouraged) policy of sharing your non-human roommates.

​Zero-judgment Gaming: Because some of us still play World of Warcraft or just want a chill Stardew session.

​The Alpha Rule: Be kind, be authentic, and remember—we’re all just trying to figure out where that mystery pain in our lower back came from.

I loved her so tenderly , innocently , freely gave my all mind body soul to her.. and she wrote me love notes , dealt with my flaws , bathed me , scrubbed my back. I was so vulnerable, I feel the rawness of my heart being opened and stabbed like a fresh wound off of a motorcycle or bike at fast speeds.. business keeps me from crying . I wanna break down.. anyways going to smoke weed and eat eggs. Later folks. I hope you see this and maybe care. I’ll never know how you moved on. I thought we were forever.

I'd say for about 6 years I have been dealing with pretty chronic nocturia, though I haven't been officially diagnosed with it.

I get up probably around a dozen times and I pee very small amounts.

The only possible thing that has helped is xanax, ativan, or ambien but I don't want to take them every night, so I do a few nights on, a few nights off.

I have been to 2 urologists, had a bladder ultrasound, had my PSA checked, etc.

All normal

I have tried medications: oxybutinin and myberteq; its possible I didn't stay on them long enough but the urologist didn't seem convinced based on my description that it would help.

It can be debilitating just in terms of how I feel the nexy day from lack of sleep.

I feel crazy; like its all in my head and that I can somehow just ignore the urge to go if I lay there but I pee, lay down and pop right back up again. I can eventually fall asleep but I inevitably wake up again.

GF mentioned trying pelvic floor training; urologist/doctor said unless I had actual leakeage, it wouldn't help.

It doesn't seem medical to me; it feels psychological and that I somehow need to break the pattern and habit but I don't know how and I feel crazy.

This sounds crazy but coud hypnosis help?

I do drink coffee but only in the mornings.

I drink beer usually only 1 at most and its about 2 hours before bed, which is what the urologist said to aim for in terms of liquids.

**I'm starting a Harry Potter fan fic called Vault Zero, I will post the summary and first chapter below. Can I have some feedback please?! This is also posted on AO3. This is nothing to do with Hogwarts or Hogwarts Legacy.**

# Vault Zero

# Summary:

>When Hermione Granger uncovers a sealed chamber that does not exist on any Ministry floor plan, she expects forgotten Dark magic.

What she finds instead is something far older — a fragment of magic that doesn’t behave like any spell ever recorded.

As ancient goblin records resurface and the deepest vaults of Gringotts begin to stir, Hermione is forced into uneasy cooperation with Draco Malfoy, whose family history may be tied to the phenomenon in ways neither of them understands.

Some magic is cast.

Some magic is inherited.

And some magic… waits.

# Chapter One: I Will Have Order

There are many ways for me to get into the Ministry; I opted for the traditional Floo Network, as always.

Structured, regulated and Ministry-approved. No unnecessary theatrics, plain and professional, in order, exactly how I *usually* like my life.

Still, after getting off the phone with Harry last night, I got an overwhelming nostalgic urge to head over to Whitehall, queue for a very questionable abandoned toilet cubicle and simply flush. It’s been a while since I felt a sense of adventure, and although I would do almost *anything* to avoid re-living past events, there are moments when I hunger for a spark to disturb the stillness.

Whilst most people’s idea of excitement would not be flushing themselves down the toilet in a subterranean washroom at 7 am, I scarcely come across many other opportunities to avoid the mundane. This isn’t a complaint by any means, I like order in my life, but it’s hard to keep that need for order under control when I had 7 turbulent years of the unknown.

Arriving in the Atrium, I adjust my jacket and satchel; dishevelment is definitely something to be desired, and head over to the elevators. Arthur Weasley, characteristically enthusiastic as always, runs to hold the gate open to the elevator I have chosen (the same as every day, second in from the left), demanding that it halt its journey just as it is about to depart.

“Hermione!”

Winded breaths escape as he tries to continue his sentence.

“Herm-\*pant\*-ione, so sorry to catch you \*pant\* so early, but I have been waiting for you for quite some time, \*heavy pant\* ever the early bird aren’t you!”

Showing his age, but his ever-growing warmth, he smiles at me and, although I am in a slight rush to get to my office, the Atrium still unsettles me somewhat, I can’t help but step out of the elevator to make a little time for him. After all, I’m by no means late for work; I’m actually two hours early. Precisely how I like it.

After Ron left his ministry posting as an Auror and the wizarding world had started to calm, the cracks that had been concealed by post-war highs and new beginnings had started to surface in our relationship. I tried, he tried, but we both knew that we were two very different people who wanted very different things out of life. He felt an undeniable and instinctive pull to be with George at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes; he wanted to start a family and live a very similar life to his parents. I wanted to work hard and make a difference to the wizarding world; I mean, we’d already started the job as teenagers, and I wanted to finish it.

The way I felt didn’t mean that I thought little of the way that Ron wanted to live. I respect him for knowing what he wants and wishing to be by his brother’s side in business. The Weasley family had been torn apart from the inside out; they needed each other. Our relationship ended amicably, of course, and over time, I do believe that we will be able to be friends once again, like the old times. It’s something I dearly hope for.

Arthur and Molly have thought no less of me since the break-up, and they have made that very clear. Birthday and Christmas presents, invites to supper and family gatherings, warm welcomes whenever I have the delight of bumping into them. And of course, I was still best friends with their daughter, Ginny. Still godmother to James, a title which I take very seriously. So, making time for Arthur Weasley was now at the top of my to-do list for the morning.

“Let’s go somewhere a little more private. I have something to ask of you, Hermione.”

Following Arthur to another elevator, we make our way to Level 2. Since becoming the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement back in 1998, he gets to bypass the shabby hallway to the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office now, but I know deep down he misses working with muggles greatly. Another reason I believe we have such great conversations around the dinner table. We catch up on the way to his office, mostly giggling about baby James’ first words being ‘Rubber Duck’, and before I know it, there we are, standing in front of the polished brass plaque bearing his name.

*‘Arthur Weasley - Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement’.*

Although it’s been almost 6 years, it does not get any less impressive as time moves on.

Stepping inside, he offers me a coffee and asks me to take a seat. After moving a mountain of paperwork from the only usable chair in the office and struggling to find room on his ornate yet deeply unorganised desk for it to live, I sit. I can imagine this room looked rather different before Arthur’s appointment; it’s of a grand structure, with high green-tiled walls polished beyond perfection, and I can’t help but picture myself in a similar room one day.

There’s a small house elf by the dark oak armoire in the corner of the office, trying desperately to stuff several of Arthur’s worldly muggle possessions in tight enough so they can be somewhat contained. Around the perimeter of the office and on every feasible surface are muggle artifcats: clocks, gearboxes, musical instruments, sponges, batteries, plugs, the list goes on. It reminds me so much of the antique stores my mother and father used to take me to when I was young. A slight pang arises in my chest.

I spot his tattered yet treasured copy of *Stick and Rudder: An Explanation of the Art of Flying* by Wolfgang Langewiesche in a gold book stand over by a clumsily executed Airfix model of a Supermarine Spitfire Mk I. The first aircraft created by the model company, no less. He has always been fascinated by planes and how they fly without magic. I can imagine him sitting late at night, charming the model to life and having it fly around the vast airspace in here.

“So! Let’s get to business. I know you are a very busy woman, Hermione, but I am looking for a little assistance in what I can only describe as a very Hermione task.”

“And what might that be?” I ask, amusement spread across my face.

“As you are more than aware, 6 years ago, the Ministry was under the control of *Voldemort*” - he still says his name as though he will appear out of thin air -“and I have had the laborious task of ensuring the integrity of our security, floor by floor, since his control diminished. The Ministry was a different place when he had ruled over it; files were altered, rooms were sealed, and quite simply, the security structure, as it were, before his arrival, almost ceased to exist.”

There it is, that pang in my chest again.

“Problem is, we’ve finally gotten to work on Level 9 after all these years, and I have come across an anomaly with the rooms up there.”

Level 9. The Department of Mysteries.

The Veil.

*Sirius*.

I hold back any sign I could be showing of the flashback entering my mind for the umpteenth time, *Harry’s scream*. I still wake in hot sweats some nights.

“Now, I have slaved over some of the paperwork we do have for this Level, and I can see that there is a door registered in an entry log that, simply put, does not knowingly exist. This is where you come in, Hermione, if you accept my cry for help.”

Ok, so he’s deeming this as a very ‘Hermione’ task as it involves possible enchantments and most of all, a precarious tower of parchment. He knows me so well.

I pull myself together. “So what you’re asking of me is to sift through this tower of documents” - I point to the ‘Not Read’ pile on his desk - “and use my knowledge of enchantments to locate this ‘hidden door’?” I question. I know this is exactly what he is asking me to do, but as always, I like to have all the facts and answers to be certain. Excitement forms within me with a hint of dread.

I love my job, working in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures is my dream come true, especially looking back at the start of my S.P.E.W campaign, but things have gotten a little slow as of late. Having something fresh and out of the ordinary to sink my teeth into would be a welcome change. But working on something in an area of the Ministry that still brings a lump to my throat? Maybe this would bring me some closure.

“Precisely! Is it something you would be up for? Do you have the time?” Arthur asks, almost stumbling over his words with happiness that he does not have to labour over this much longer.

I think for a minute, the dread dissipates somewhat, and the excitement takes over. “Yes, Arthur, I’d be honoured to help you. You know I have a certain affinity towards your department, and I would be happy to assist you however I can.” Arthur jumps out of his seat, elated, and comes closer for a quick and awkward embrace. Awkward since he has knocked over most of his ‘Read’ pile of documents onto the immaculately mopped floor. Organised chaos at its finest.

“Thank you, Hermione! I knew I could count on you. Such a bright wizard for such a young age, has anybody ever told you that?” He hands me a small document wallet that only moments ago was almost as tall as my 5-foot-5 frame. I must have missed the enchantment whilst marvelling at the sheer amount of parchment now lining the floor.

“It’s probably nothing,” he says lightly. “Old registry charmwork can get temperamental after structural renovations, of which you can imagine we have had to make a few. But if there’s a sealed room we’ve overlooked, I’d rather know sooner than later.”

I nod in agreement, because of course he would, it’s his job. After a very Arthur Weasley goodbye and an acceptance to dinner at the Burrow next Thursday, I leave the office of the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and make my way to my own. It’s a welcome breath of fresh air when I enter the familiar door to my office on Level 4. Clean cut, tidy, all in order. Just how I like it. I set the tiny file down on the floor next to my meticulously organised desk, erase Arthur’s shrinking enchantment and take off the top piece of parchment.

I will have order in this chaos.

I expect to see inconsistencies, misaligned ward references, clumsily entered magical geography and maybe an outdated floor plan. Instead, I find an activity registry extract.

*Activity Detected: Level 9 – Sub-Corridor C*  
*Status: Accessed*  
*Door ID: Unassigned*  
*Direction: From Interior*  
*Spell Trace: None*

I read it again. No Spell Trace?

And again.

“From the interior?” I ask myself in a whisper.

How can the only activity documented around this door be somebody leaving from the inside? And better yet, departing into a corridor that does not exist. There is no Sub-Corridor C listed on Level 9.

The Ministry registry does not invent doors. Every physical entrance is anchored to architectural mapping charms, wards in some circumstances. Every access logs a wand signature from the witch or wizard leaving or entering the space.

Every spell leaves residue. A footprint.

And yet, according to this record, something opened a door that does not exist.

From the inside.

I lay the parchment on my desk in slow motion, not taking my eyes from it. For the first time that morning, the stillness feels less like order.

The stillness feels more like waiting.

And then -

My wand, resting beneath my fingers, *hums*.

Just once.

So faintly, I almost convince myself it didn’t hum at all.",3,1771700107.0,HPfanfiction,2,1.0,False
1raz88z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1raz88z,Presidents Day at Epcot- Not too bad for us,"Trip report on Presidents day. It was crazy busy but we had a great time, two adults no kids. Rode everything we wanted to and didn't wait longer then 20 minutes with early entry and LL's. 

7:50 park in the parking lot

8:00 made our way through security and head to the early entry line. It's the longest I've ever seen in my life, making multiple loops back and forth. Staff seemed confused/stressed over how to keep it organized and keeps going on walkies.

8:15 We start moving in. Us and about half the crowd head to Guardians. It is backed up almost all the way to where the blue tent is. I tell my husband it's not worth it as we have a LL in an hour for it and let's pivot our plan. We end up hitting up Joffreys and walk over to Mars instead.

8:30 He rides Mars, I hang out in the exit enjoying the quiet vibes and drinking coffee. 

8:45 we head over to Soarin, it's a 5 minute posted wait 

9:00 walk next door to Living with the land, also 5 minute posted wait 

When walking out notice both of those are now over 30 minutes. Glance at the app and see Nemo is still 5 so bounce over there 

9:15 in line for Nemo, it was closer to 15 then 'stalled' twice. 

9:45 Head to our LL for guardians 

10:15 head over to Spaceship Earth with a LL. About a 10 minute wait, posted normal wait is 40 minutes. 

10:45 notice my test track LL disappeared, walk over to a blue tent they show it was canceled but reissue it for me thankfully. 

11:00 Geo82- have the banana bread espresso martini and some of the hummus, second drink I ask if the bartender has anything he recommends and he does a strawberry French 75 thats perfect. My husband has two beers. Nice to chill for a bit, absolutely love it there.

12:45 Head over to Figments with a LL, it's walk on with it. 

1:00 Walk over to Living with the land to be nearby for our Behind the Seeds tour

1:30 Go ""Behind the Seeds"", it's a fun tour especially if your a nerd for plants and living with the land. We got to eat some cucmber and found out the tree they removed a few days was not replanted but given to the animals to eat/play with over at Animal Kingdom :/

2:30 Head over for LL at Test Track 

3:00 Start making our way ""around the world"". Stop to browse some art and check out the merch for FARTS, wanted a spirit jersey but they didn't have my size and they said they had been long sold out of the ears. Oh well! 

3:20 Go against everything in me and walk the ""wrong way"" towards Canada since we have a reservstion at Spice Roads at 4. Stop for a drink (some alcoholic some not) at every country along the way. 

4:00 Get to Spice Roads, realize we have not eaten anything other then some hummus and are starving. Get the trio and shrimp, it was all amazing. Still hungry but want to munch on some other food along the way. 

5:00 keep going around the world, stop by Ratatouille to check out the single riders line and cast member tell us it's at least an hour long. We decided to skip it this visit. Grab a half baguette and butter from France, one of our favorite snacks haha.

5:30 End up right outside where the Broadway performance is and they are letting a few more people in so we end up joining and watching. I really enjoyed it and was glad we got to stop in. 

6:30ish Can feel the crowds getting crankier and decide we'd rather head back and grab dinner at our resort (Port Orleans Riverside) and chill for the evening. 

Overall 10/10 day, only missed out riding Ratatouille and Frozen which I had kinda predicted, the LL's were fully booked when we entered the park but was okay with that. We're not big on waiting in long lines and I was thrilled we did all of my ""must rides"" along with Geo82 and Behind the Seeds on a super busy day.",28,1771700030.0,WaltDisneyWorld,8,0.94,False

There came a stirring in the shadows, a furtive tread, and a grunt. Though swathed in slumber, some portion of Vic’s mentality had anticipated a home invasion. His adrenaline surged, bringing instant alertness. Awakening, he discovered himself still spooning Beth, both of them completely dressed—wearing shoes, even.

 

There was a thump near the foot of the bed. *Somebody else is in the room!* was Vic’s realization. *Oh, shit! The signal jammer!*

 

He couldn’t remember where he’d left it. Was it in Beth’s living room? Beneath the bed? *No, it must be near the couch somewhere. That’s where I activated it, back when I thought that sex with Beth was a possibility.*  

 

Cat-silent, he reached over, hand-searching the nightstand for its table lamp. Then came illumination, revealing—big surprise—a guy wearing a monkey finger surgical mask, dressed in black clothing.

 

Two shock-widened oculi swung toward Vic, but Vic was already in motion. Tackling the intruder to the ground, he then flailed at his face, slapping and punching like a rabid baboon, until the man’s eyes rolled back. 

 

*Should I kill him?* Vic wondered. *Might as well.* He jumped to standing. 

 

One time, back in high school, Vic had observed a group of local skateboarders half-assedly attempting to grind a five-stair handrail. After one longhaired fella tired of repeatedly shooting his board out, too cowardly to keep his body above it, he’d commenced an embarrassing tantrum, shrieking and flailing like a petulant child. Finally, he’d stomped his skateboard, snapping it out of spite. 

 

Mimicking that lady pants-wearing scumfuck, Vic stomped. Beneath his sneaker, a face imploded, like an eggshell filled with sodden meat.   

 

*This is it*, he thought. *I don’t know where I’m going, but I can’t stay here after this. I need to grab the jammer, and then hit my apartment for that gun and some clothing. I’ll bring Beth and Orson. If they kick in some gas money, we can leave Scumfuck City forever. We’ll head to Florida, get my new debit card from my parents, and hang around for a while. Our pale asses need some sun, anyway.* 

 

He woke Beth with a kiss, which, this time, she let go on for a bit. Vic even slipped his tongue in, rooting around her point of severance. *You know, this isn’t bad*, he thought. *A little dry, but nice.*

 

Placing her hand on his cheek, Beth blinked herself awake. If only that moment could have lasted.  

 

“They’ve come for us,” he informed her. “There’s a corpse on the floor, and we’ll be joining that bastard in Hell if we don’t get out of here. It’s finally time to leave this scum pit.”

 

With relief in her eyes, she nodded. 

 

“Pack everything you wanna keep. We won’t be coming back. Hey, I’m gonna run to my apartment for a few things, and then stop by Orson’s place. We’ll take him with us, and maybe Salamasina, if she wants to go. Do you still have the Ruger they gave you?”

 

She nodded.    

 

“Do you know how to use it?”

 

Again, she nodded. 

 

“Good. Load it and keep it near. If anybody but me shows up, put a bullet through their forehead. These bastards are wearing bulletproof vests.”

 

He kissed her again, and then rummaged in the living room, searching for the signal jammer. It wasn’t on the coffee table or the sofa. Under the couch, however, Vic spotted a blinking red light. 

 

*Good, it’s still on*, he thought. *I must have accidentally kicked it under there. That’s why that Silent bastard couldn’t find it.* 

 

Pocketing the device, Vic sprinted to his apartment. *No intruders*, he realized. *Make this quick, Vicster.* First, he loaded his Ruger. His Samsonite duffle bag yet contained many .357 Magnum rounds. Into it, Vic added clothing—socks, boxers, shirts and pants—grabbed at random. Everything else, he abandoned. 

 

When his knocking went unanswered, Vic shrugged, and kicked Orson’s door in. No Orson in sight. In the guy’s bedroom, Vic found blood and shattered teeth. *Did they get him?* he wondered. *Are those Orson’s remnants, or some Silent scumfuck’s? Fuck it, I’m out of here.* 

 

Remembering the time he’d borrowed gas funds from Orson, Vic checked the kitchen cupboard before leaving, finding a coffee can stuffed with small bills. Pocketing the funds, he thought, *Sorry, buddy, but you might be dead, and we’ll need this.* 

 

He ran back to Beth’s apartment. The Silent corpse was missing, as was Beth. Discovering an open gym bag, Vic howled and punched his own head. *You stupid bastard!* he self-admonished. *How many horror movies have you seen? You never, ever, ever leave a female unattended! Now they got her, and there’s not one muthafuckin’ thing I can do about it! I have to figure out how to save her.*

 

Pulling the Ruger from his pocket, Vic did the ol’ secret agent bit, becoming a silent shadow, sliding around corners—gun ready, eye-sweeping the *mise-en-scène*. That’s how he imagined it, anyway. 

 

The truth was, with the shouldered duffle bag throwing his balance off, Vic’s stealth became blundering slapstick. So when masked Silent began pouring from their apartments, only Vic’s proximity to the stairwell made the parking garage reachable. Into his car he hurried, keying the engine, then coasting up to the security gate. For one nightmarish instant, Vic feared that they’d deactivated it. But after a key card sensor swipe, the barrier squealed and lurched open. 

 

Silent fell upon his Taurus, attempting to wrench its doors open, battering at Vic through its lowered window. Stomping the accelerator, he sped from the complex, flinging away six clinging Silent, who seemed to revolve in slow motion, visual poetry, before they hit concrete. Hearing gunshots, he quick-glanced behind him to see his rear windshield spiderwebbed. 

 

Speeding into unknown circumstances, he watched the blood moon meet the horizon.  



 

**Chapter 17**

 

Vic spent the ensuing day in his vehicle, immobile in various parking lots, moving every time somebody took note of him. Fearing that the Silent Minority had placed a GPS tracker on his car’s underside, he left the signal jammer running, charging it with a USB charger that he picked up on the cheap. 

 

That night, alternating between terror cringes and rage shudders, he drank himself insensate. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Awakening the next morning—sweaty and uncomfortable, his head throbbing—he realized: *Just two more days until they strike. Introverts against a frat house…another ridiculous charade. There’s got to be a way I can use that.*

 

He pulled up to a gas station, and therein bought some coffee. Outside the establishment, a newspaper vending machine caught his eye. On the paper’s front page, a familiar face grimaced. *Oh, Orson. What did those monsters do to you?*

 

Naturally, he bought a copy, and read:

 

***COAST MALL MASSACRE!*** 

 

*Yesterday morning, tragedy stuck Southern California’s Coast Mall, resulting in three hundred and fourteen fatalities. A single shooter, identified by authorities as Orson Brown, age thirty-six, gunned down every shopper, storeowner, employee, and security guard in the complex. There were no survivors.* 

 

“Bullshit,” Vic muttered. “Orson wasn’t the fuckin’ Terminator. What, did the dude have a magical, self-replenishing ammo supply? Give me a fuckin’ break.” Noticing a sea hag staring, he finished the article in silence. 

 

*Hours prior to his rampage, Brown uploaded a disturbing video to his freshly-created Skewlclips page, which featured him running naked through an unidentified apartment complex, brandishing the revolver he would later use to commit suicide. He also posted dozens of hateful rants, extolling Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden, promising to make them proud.*

 

*Investigators are currently looking into Brown’s recent whereabouts, hoping to identify the shooter’s accomplices, and determine whether his killing spree was part of the al-Qaeda attacks plaguing our nation of late.* 

 

His face rippling with suppressed emotion, Vic walked to his car. Something surged within him, a bile uprush, which he knelt and ejected beside the driver’s side door. Swiveling his glance from the vomit, he noticed a message finger-scrawled in the Taurus’ door dust: *SKEWLCLIPS*.

 

*Orson must have written that*, he realized. *It’s some kind of warning, I bet. Did he know that those bastards were gonna frame him? I’ll look into Skewlclips later. For now, I’ve got some jocks to visit.*   



\* \* \* \* \*

 

From East Pacific High School’s bleachers, Vic watched football practice wind down. Unenthusiastically, the Squids ran the same play over and over, as their beet-faced coach blew a shiny whistle and shouted inarticulately. 

 

From a solitary payphone, Vic had called the school that morning, claiming to be a talent scout hoping to observe players covertly, to see if they had true heart. Luckily, the secretary had believed him. “They’re practicin’ after school,” she’d remarked. 

 

*Damn, this is boring*, Vic thought. *Is this really how I wanna spend my last couple of days? Honestly, I could forget all this Silent bullshit, lose my identity, and go anywhere.* Then he remembered Beth’s face and, in righteous rage, grew resolute. 

 

Finally, practice ended. “I expect you pussies to try harder!” the coach shouted, before stomping his way off the field. 

 

“Hey, hold up a second!” Vic shouted to the players, rushing onto the field-encircling four hundred-meter track, intercepting the Squids as they trod toward their locker room. 

 

“Yo, whadda you want?” asked a sweaty African American, whom Vic recognized as Javon Johns from the newscast. 

 

Vic waited for somebody to call him “fruit” or “faggot,” but the team just stared, grass-stained and reeking, exhausted. “Yeah, I’ve got a couple questions for you guys.” 

 

Still no insults. Maybe the fight song humiliation had affected them after all. “Ask ’em then,” grumbled a large Caucasian, sporting a surprisingly full beard for a high schooler. *Was this guy at the motel?* Vic wondered. *I don’t remember him being there. Maybe he replaced one of the dead players.*   

 

“Okey-doke. First off, why the bullshit?” 

 

“Bullshit?” a linebacker asked. 

 

“Yeah, bullshit. More specifically, why did you guys claim that al-Qaeda made you do the ol’ dongs out sing-along?”

 

At that, a pulsation seemed to pass through the Squids. Gazes dropped; awkward shuffling commenced. 

 

“Them muthafuckas wore turbans, boy,” Javon eventually answered. “The fuck we supposed ta call ’em?”  

 

“Surgical masks with painted on ape fingers hardly qualify as turbans. I know what really happened. Y’all drove to a motel for a slice of whore, only to end up ambushed by a robot and his creepy cronies.”

 

“Yo, what’s this dude talkin’ about?” the bearded new guy asked. “You guys weren’t lyin’ all this time, were you?”

 

The other players, feeling their deceit unraveling, reached the same conclusion: *This guy was there that day.* Rage bent their features; hands curled into fists. Soon, they’d be upon Vic. 

 

“I know what you’re thinking,” Vic said. “Let’s kill this little fuckbag, and cling to our daydream forever.” He pulled the Ruger from his waistband, letting it twinkle under the dipping sun. “But I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Sure, you’ll eventually kill me, but at least one of y’all is getting their pecker shot off first. Besides, I’m not your enemy here. Believe it or not, I’m tryin’ to help you. So, so, so…let’s try again. Why blame al-Qaeda? Sure, they’re not exactly nuns, but aren’t those dudes already infamous enough as it is? What the dilly-o?” 

 

“Yo, we ain’t gotta tell you shit,” replied the most roided out Asian American that Vic had ever seen. 

 

“No, you don’t. I won’t even try to kill you. But think about it for a second. Once, you were the kings of this crappy little campus, but look at you now. Everybody under the sun has seen your willies. For some of you, that might be a point of pride. ‘Yeah, I’m tripod status,’ you might brag, ignoring the fact that you let a bunch of nerds punk you. For the rest of you, though…I mean, holy shrink ray, Batman. Lookin’ like a grass shrimp.”

 

Embarrassed yet livid, they shuffled and muttered. 

 

“Nah, I’m not tryin’ to clown you. Honestly, I’m not exactly Ron Jeremy myself. What I’m getting at, though, is that revenge is a possibility for *all of us*. That group that made you sing au naturel…well, they’ve been messing with me for a while now. So, one last time I ask you…why did you lie on the news?”

 

“Money, dog,” Javon muttered, barely audible. “A thousand dollars each, man. What the hell were we supposed to do?”

 

“See, now we’re gettin’ somewhere. Who paid you?” 

 

“This dude. Before the cops even showed up, there he was—like he came from the shadows, or somethin’. Homeboy was *all decked out*: custom-fitted suit, fly ass Rolex. I mean, for a corny ass white man, dude was stylin’.” 

 

The jocks nodded in agreement. 

 

“Okay, so he was *GQ* status. What else can you tell me?”

 

“Well, ya know, our two homies were dead, right? Some of us—not this here pimp, *obviously*, but some of us—were cryin’ straight bitch style. But this dude, he was Mr. Smooth. Them corpses didn’t even bother him, brah. He’s like, ‘I’m sorry for your losses,’ but, I swear, that boy was grinnin’. Then he asks us about our finances. So we’re like, ‘The fuck’s this dude gettin’ at?’ I mean, some of us were still puttin’ our clothes on, nah mean? But he’s like, ‘I know that you gentlemen have experienced some trauma, but perhaps you can profit from it. I’m going to tell you a story. If you repeat it for me, to the cops and every single reporter that approaches you, I’ll give each of you one thousand dollars.’ I mean, on the real, it’s hard to get that skrilla when we’re practicing 24/7. Them pockets been dusty, nahm sayin’?” 

 

“I think so.”    

 

“I mean…we were still staggered from them roofies, so our thoughts were all slow and shit. But the dude just kept tellin’ us: al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda. Eventually, we’re talkin’ and…man, we all be wantin’ that dough. So we’re like, ‘Yeah, brah, you give us them greenbacks, we’ll tell ’em whatever you want.’”

 

“Okay, okay. And since you never retracted those statements, I’m assuming that he came through with the money.” 

 

The Squids nodded. 

 

“How did he get it to you?”

 

“He dropped by our next practice,” the buff Asian American contributed. “Yeah, the guy called us over to his Lexus, where he had all these Benjamins bundled up, and handed us each a stack. Man, we tore the strip club up that night.” 

 

“And you never got the dude’s name?”

 

“Nope.” 

 

“Hmmm. What about his license plate number?”

 

“Man, why would we give a shit?” Javon laughed. 

 

“Hey, wait a minute,” the smallest jock interjected. “Didn’t you take that celly snap, Mark?” 

 

“Aw, that’s right,” a wispy-mustached African American admitted. “Showin’ off them hundreds, baby. Come to think of it, the back of the dude’s Lexus was in the shot. I might even have gotten his license plate.”

 

“You mind if I see it?”

 

“Yeah, boy, I got that in my locker. Follow us.”

 

Reluctantly, Vic did. 

 

*That’s where they dangled Marty from*, Vic realized, scrutinizing empty ceiling space. *I can’t turn my back on these guys, or I’ll end up tormented.* 

 

A cellphone was thrust before him. Indeed, beneath the arms of a cash-brandishing football player, in the photograph’s lower left corner, a license plate was visible. With a mental mantra, Vic committed the vehicular identification number to memory. “Alright, we’re almost done here. Before I take off, though, I need a description. You said that the guy’s a snappy dresser, but what does he actually look like?”

 

“Well, ya know, dude was one of them pretty boy types,” Javon eventually answered. “I mean, no homo, but the boy had them cheekbones, like one of them actors, or whatevsky. Short blonde hair, shaved with precision. Not buff, but not chubby either.”

 

“Yeah, that’s good enough. I have to say, you guys have been surprisingly cooperative.”

 

“Fuck you, brah. Kill yourself.” 

 

“Not myself, no…but, believe me, these hands might soon kill. I’m goin’ after the bastards behind this, the ones who tricked introverts into attacking you, claiming that it would make a difference. This guy who paid you…deep down, you all know that he had something to do with it. For a measly thousand bucks apiece, these scumfucks turned you into laughingstocks. Don’t you want payback?” 

 

The Squids hemmed and hawed, but eventually repressed rage resurfaced. “Fuck that guy!” one bellowed. 

 

Vic had them. 

 

“Okay, I have my signal jammer on right now, but, otherwise, they could be watchin’ us. Stay paranoid, guys, and we might actually pull this off. I’m gonna investigate your moneyman. If I can figure out his identity, I can formulate a plan. If so, I’ll write it down and tape it under the bleachers. At this time tomorrow, go visit that dead drop, and we might all find the vengeance we crave. And, for the love of God, speak nothing of this over the phone.”

 

On that note, he left. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

*Damn, I’m gonna have to use another payphone*, Vic realized. *The second that I turn my celly on, they can track me. Careful, man. You’re dancing on the edge of oblivion. ‘Edge of Oblivion.’ Wasn’t that some crappy sci-fi movie? Don’t think about it, Vicster. Now’s not the time.* 

 

And there one was, a graffiti-blemished relic standing outside a grubby drive-through carwash. From his glove box, Vic fished out his insurance provider’s phone number. Exiting, he grabbed a fistful of change. 

 

After many minutes of hold music hell, Vic was speaking with a presumably live human. “Yeah, some jackass just hit my car and drove off,” he told them, after relating some personal information. “Uh-huh, uh-huh. Sure. He was a clean-cut sort of fella, blonde haired and vaguely fit. The guy drove a green Lexus with the license plate, uh…” *Damn, why didn’t I write it down?* he wondered. *C’mon, Vic, think.* Remembering the alphanumeric code, Vic recited. 

 

Promising that he’d look into it, the insurance drone provided Vic with a claim number. 

 

“My phone’s not working right now. Can I call you back later?” 

 

“Sure thing. We’ll identify the vehicle’s owner and contact their insurance provider. Give us a ring tomorrow morning, at any time after eight, and we should have some information for you. If you haven’t already, make sure to file an accident report with the police.”

 

“Yeah, I will.” *Fat chance, asshole.* “Talk to you tomorrow.” 

 

He hung up, wishing for a shower to call his own. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

*Last morning before the last morning*, Vic thought, parting crusted-over eyelids, feeling like an old landfill phonebook. His car was sweltering, and his unwashed attire seemed to be growing into his skin. Still, righteous plasma flowed throughout him. *Vic the Volcano, primed to erupt*, he thought.  

 

First, he called his insurance provider. After reciting the same information that he’d provided the previous day, plus his claim number, he was met with vocalized bewilderment: “Well, Mr. Dickens, we contacted the vehicle’s owner, Mr. Rockford Smith, and he claims that he never hit you. He sent us a photograph of his Lexus, and the car appears unscratched. Furthermore, we contacted your local police department, and it seems that you never filed an accident report. Are you being truthful with us, Mr. Dickens?”

 

“Huh…never mind then,” he mumbled, hanging up. *Well, they’ll be canceling my policy now, but at least I got the name. Rockford Smith…sounds like a porn star’s moniker. Or would that be Rockford Stiff? Let’s just hope that this scumfuck’s on social media. Then again, what douchebags aren’t these days? He knows that I’m after him now, so I’ll have to attempt some intellect here.*  

 

Climbing into his now uninsured Taurus, Vic hollered, “To the library!” 

 

Outside the liquor store, near the outskirts payphone that Vic had used, a patchwork wino belched, then fell face-first into his own vomit. *Splorsh*.

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Vic didn’t know why he’d held onto his library card—having visited there only once, to borrow texts for a high school term paper—but there it was, in his wallet behind a years-defunct bookstore’s club card. Just over his dashboard, the building loomed, its insulated glass exterior coated in grime and bird shit. A mass of twitching jitters, Vic crossed the windswept parking lot. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Plopping afore a computer terminal, he entered his name and patron identification number. *Time for a little web search*, he thought. *God, I hope that the Silent Minority can’t track me here. How far does their evil eye see?* 

 

Resisting the urge to check his email, Vic looked up Rockford Smith. There were more of them than he’d anticipated. After adding his state and city to the search, Vic had his man. On a business-focused social networking site, Rockford had posted a profile. He worked for Skewlclips, it turned out, as the executive assistant of the chairman and chief executive officer, Skip Elliot. 

 

*Ain’t that a bucket of craziness*, Vic thought. *This dude works for the same company that Orson tried to warn me about. Something sinister is going on here.*

 

Next, Vic looked up Skewlclips. Unfortunately, one of the top results was an article, “Skewlclips Exposes Terrorist Network.” His stomach heaving, Vic clicked the link.  

 

The story, written by Newt Bradley, read: 

 

*This morning, the National Security Agency released a statement, settling months of speculation. A new branch of al-Qaeda is operating inside the United States, they reported, and is using a popular video-sharing website to attract fresh militants.*  

 

*According to the statement, Skip Elliot—the CEO of Skewlclips—came forward after discovering dozens of videos being exchanged between Hazeem Smith, Orson Brown, and others they’ve identified as Matilda Grieves, Elizabeth Glass, Victor Dickens, Marty MacNamara, and Salamasina Savea.* 

 

*The latter five terrorists are currently at large, the NSA stated. If any American knows of their whereabouts, the agency requests that they immediately contact authorities, so that the group can be quickly apprehended.*

 

There, at the bottom of the page, was Vic’s senior portrait, alongside photos of Matilda, Marty, Elizabeth and Salamasina. *Sally Mass, I’m sorry*, Vic thought. *Those bastards got you too, didn’t they? And Beth, are you even alive? Please be.* 

 

Vic knew that he should flee. Though the library held few visitors, somebody might have read the paper, or seen his face on TV. Were wide eyes observing him? Were trembling forefingers dialing 911? *No, I have to finish*, he thought. *Is Skip Elliot the evil mastermind behind all of this, or just another link in the chain?*   

 

To uncover the truth, Vic ran a search on Skip Elliot. After perusing much biographical bullshit—Harvard this, charity that—he unearthed a fresh video, posted just minutes prior. There was Skip, positioned behind a lectern bearing the Skewclips logo: a stylized *SK*. After some introductory blather, the man got down to business, saying, “Since the al-Qaeda video incident, many concerned users have contacted our company, asking if we’ve been monitoring your videos all this time. Right now, you are likely imagining yourself trapped within some Orwellian nightmare, with an impersonal government entity monitoring your every move. Well, rest assured. We have been monitoring you, but only for *your* benefit.”

 

Vic paused the video, wondering, *Those last sentences, where have I heard them before?* Then it dawned on him: *Holy shit, it was in the DAY OF THE INTROVERT pamphlet*. *Did this dude write the thing? At the very least, he’s read it.*   

 

Concluding, Skip made assurances that only professional security experts were monitoring Skewlclips videos, for the sole purpose of rooting out domestic terrorism.   

 

*Man, something stinks here*, Vic thought. *Time to read up on Skewlclips.* Seconds later, he was viewing the company’s history. 

 

Apparently, Skewlclips had been founded in 2005, spreading from one college to the next, exponentially acquiring users, earning billions in ad revenue. An interesting factoid surfaced. Skewlclips had a parent company: Investutech. 

 

*Oh, hell no*, Vic thought. *Is that what this is, one of those evil-company-that-secretly-controls-the-world dealies? Fuckin’ Investutech.* 

 

Everybody knew Investutech. The company’s logo was everywhere: billboards, ads, stadiums, convention centers, half of the consumer technology currently in use. Celebrities endorsed it; Hollywood blockbusters pimped its products like crazy. 

 

Investutech was the top innovator in many fields, ranging from everyday consumer products to fringe sciences so advanced that they seemed more like sorcery. Its annual budget stretched into the billions; its patents were myriad. Supposedly, a coalition of the world’s wealthiest billionaires had funded Investutech, though their identities remained undisclosed. Over the years, the multinational conglomerate had plundered Silicon Valley, swallowing startups by the dozen. 

 

Calling up a list of Investutech subsidiaries, Vic found nearly one hundred companies listed. Scrolling through the list, he noticed three of interest: Meteor Armaments Company, Stunnervations, Inc., and XBC. 

 

*So they’re making toys and guns, and seemingly controlling the media*, Vic thought. *Is that why they gave us Ruger firearms, to associate their competition with terrorists? Come to think of it, every major Silent story was exclusive to XBC. That’s where Nanny Gaines is televised, too. This al-Qaeda nonsense drove XBC’s ratings up, increasing their ad revenue. So all the lies, all this death and misery was…what, a ploy to fatten up Investutech’s bottom line? How much money does one company need?*

 

Another subsidiary caught his eye: InVo Music Group, the world’s largest music corporation. The company owned dozens of record labels, including Rap Nasty, Bebop Steady, Substratal, and Diva Classics. *Holy crap*, Vic thought. *All that terrible mainstream music that I’ve been hearing—“Shamdiggly,” “Beep, Beep, Beep,” “Dem Showah Boyz,” and all the rest—can be traced back to Investutech. What, are they trying to dumb humanity down to make consumers more compliant?*     

 

*Man, this is too much. Battling Investutech is like trying to fistfight the ocean. But maybe I can take Skip Elliot down, and rescue Beth and Salamasina…if they’re still alive. I don’t know if I can clear our names, but I’ve gotta try something. Time to get out of here, devise a plan, and get a message to the Squids. Think, Vicster, think.* ",1,1771699898.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False

There came a stirring in the shadows, a furtive tread, and a grunt. Though swathed in slumber, some portion of Vic’s mentality had anticipated a home invasion. His adrenaline surged, bringing instant alertness. Awakening, he discovered himself still spooning Beth, both of them completely dressed—wearing shoes, even.

 

There was a thump near the foot of the bed. *Somebody else is in the room!* was Vic’s realization. *Oh, shit! The signal jammer!*

 

He couldn’t remember where he’d left it. Was it in Beth’s living room? Beneath the bed? *No, it must be near the couch somewhere. That’s where I activated it, back when I thought that sex with Beth was a possibility.*  

 

Cat-silent, he reached over, hand-searching the nightstand for its table lamp. Then came illumination, revealing—big surprise—a guy wearing a monkey finger surgical mask, dressed in black clothing.

 

Two shock-widened oculi swung toward Vic, but Vic was already in motion. Tackling the intruder to the ground, he then flailed at his face, slapping and punching like a rabid baboon, until the man’s eyes rolled back. 

 

*Should I kill him?* Vic wondered. *Might as well.* He jumped to standing. 

 

One time, back in high school, Vic had observed a group of local skateboarders half-assedly attempting to grind a five-stair handrail. After one longhaired fella tired of repeatedly shooting his board out, too cowardly to keep his body above it, he’d commenced an embarrassing tantrum, shrieking and flailing like a petulant child. Finally, he’d stomped his skateboard, snapping it out of spite. 

 

Mimicking that lady pants-wearing scumfuck, Vic stomped. Beneath his sneaker, a face imploded, like an eggshell filled with sodden meat.   

 

*This is it*, he thought. *I don’t know where I’m going, but I can’t stay here after this. I need to grab the jammer, and then hit my apartment for that gun and some clothing. I’ll bring Beth and Orson. If they kick in some gas money, we can leave Scumfuck City forever. We’ll head to Florida, get my new debit card from my parents, and hang around for a while. Our pale asses need some sun, anyway.* 

 

He woke Beth with a kiss, which, this time, she let go on for a bit. Vic even slipped his tongue in, rooting around her point of severance. *You know, this isn’t bad*, he thought. *A little dry, but nice.*

 

Placing her hand on his cheek, Beth blinked herself awake. If only that moment could have lasted.  

 

“They’ve come for us,” he informed her. “There’s a corpse on the floor, and we’ll be joining that bastard in Hell if we don’t get out of here. It’s finally time to leave this scum pit.”

 

With relief in her eyes, she nodded. 

 

“Pack everything you wanna keep. We won’t be coming back. Hey, I’m gonna run to my apartment for a few things, and then stop by Orson’s place. We’ll take him with us, and maybe Salamasina, if she wants to go. Do you still have the Ruger they gave you?”

 

She nodded.    

 

“Do you know how to use it?”

 

Again, she nodded. 

 

“Good. Load it and keep it near. If anybody but me shows up, put a bullet through their forehead. These bastards are wearing bulletproof vests.”

 

He kissed her again, and then rummaged in the living room, searching for the signal jammer. It wasn’t on the coffee table or the sofa. Under the couch, however, Vic spotted a blinking red light. 

 

*Good, it’s still on*, he thought. *I must have accidentally kicked it under there. That’s why that Silent bastard couldn’t find it.* 

 

Pocketing the device, Vic sprinted to his apartment. *No intruders*, he realized. *Make this quick, Vicster.* First, he loaded his Ruger. His Samsonite duffle bag yet contained many .357 Magnum rounds. Into it, Vic added clothing—socks, boxers, shirts and pants—grabbed at random. Everything else, he abandoned. 

 

When his knocking went unanswered, Vic shrugged, and kicked Orson’s door in. No Orson in sight. In the guy’s bedroom, Vic found blood and shattered teeth. *Did they get him?* he wondered. *Are those Orson’s remnants, or some Silent scumfuck’s? Fuck it, I’m out of here.* 

 

Remembering the time he’d borrowed gas funds from Orson, Vic checked the kitchen cupboard before leaving, finding a coffee can stuffed with small bills. Pocketing the funds, he thought, *Sorry, buddy, but you might be dead, and we’ll need this.* 

 

He ran back to Beth’s apartment. The Silent corpse was missing, as was Beth. Discovering an open gym bag, Vic howled and punched his own head. *You stupid bastard!* he self-admonished. *How many horror movies have you seen? You never, ever, ever leave a female unattended! Now they got her, and there’s not one muthafuckin’ thing I can do about it! I have to figure out how to save her.*

 

Pulling the Ruger from his pocket, Vic did the ol’ secret agent bit, becoming a silent shadow, sliding around corners—gun ready, eye-sweeping the *mise-en-scène*. That’s how he imagined it, anyway. 

 

The truth was, with the shouldered duffle bag throwing his balance off, Vic’s stealth became blundering slapstick. So when masked Silent began pouring from their apartments, only Vic’s proximity to the stairwell made the parking garage reachable. Into his car he hurried, keying the engine, then coasting up to the security gate. For one nightmarish instant, Vic feared that they’d deactivated it. But after a key card sensor swipe, the barrier squealed and lurched open. 

 

Silent fell upon his Taurus, attempting to wrench its doors open, battering at Vic through its lowered window. Stomping the accelerator, he sped from the complex, flinging away six clinging Silent, who seemed to revolve in slow motion, visual poetry, before they hit concrete. Hearing gunshots, he quick-glanced behind him to see his rear windshield spiderwebbed. 

 

Speeding into unknown circumstances, he watched the blood moon meet the horizon.  



 

**Chapter 17**

 

Vic spent the ensuing day in his vehicle, immobile in various parking lots, moving every time somebody took note of him. Fearing that the Silent Minority had placed a GPS tracker on his car’s underside, he left the signal jammer running, charging it with a USB charger that he picked up on the cheap. 

 

That night, alternating between terror cringes and rage shudders, he drank himself insensate. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Awakening the next morning—sweaty and uncomfortable, his head throbbing—he realized: *Just two more days until they strike. Introverts against a frat house…another ridiculous charade. There’s got to be a way I can use that.*

 

He pulled up to a gas station, and therein bought some coffee. Outside the establishment, a newspaper vending machine caught his eye. On the paper’s front page, a familiar face grimaced. *Oh, Orson. What did those monsters do to you?*

 

Naturally, he bought a copy, and read:

 

***COAST MALL MASSACRE!*** 

 

*Yesterday morning, tragedy stuck Southern California’s Coast Mall, resulting in three hundred and fourteen fatalities. A single shooter, identified by authorities as Orson Brown, age thirty-six, gunned down every shopper, storeowner, employee, and security guard in the complex. There were no survivors.* 

 

“Bullshit,” Vic muttered. “Orson wasn’t the fuckin’ Terminator. What, did the dude have a magical, self-replenishing ammo supply? Give me a fuckin’ break.” Noticing a sea hag staring, he finished the article in silence. 

 

*Hours prior to his rampage, Brown uploaded a disturbing video to his freshly-created Skewlclips page, which featured him running naked through an unidentified apartment complex, brandishing the revolver he would later use to commit suicide. He also posted dozens of hateful rants, extolling Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden, promising to make them proud.*

 

*Investigators are currently looking into Brown’s recent whereabouts, hoping to identify the shooter’s accomplices, and determine whether his killing spree was part of the al-Qaeda attacks plaguing our nation of late.* 

 

His face rippling with suppressed emotion, Vic walked to his car. Something surged within him, a bile uprush, which he knelt and ejected beside the driver’s side door. Swiveling his glance from the vomit, he noticed a message finger-scrawled in the Taurus’ door dust: *SKEWLCLIPS*.

 

*Orson must have written that*, he realized. *It’s some kind of warning, I bet. Did he know that those bastards were gonna frame him? I’ll look into Skewlclips later. For now, I’ve got some jocks to visit.*   



\* \* \* \* \*

 

From East Pacific High School’s bleachers, Vic watched football practice wind down. Unenthusiastically, the Squids ran the same play over and over, as their beet-faced coach blew a shiny whistle and shouted inarticulately. 

 

From a solitary payphone, Vic had called the school that morning, claiming to be a talent scout hoping to observe players covertly, to see if they had true heart. Luckily, the secretary had believed him. “They’re practicin’ after school,” she’d remarked. 

 

*Damn, this is boring*, Vic thought. *Is this really how I wanna spend my last couple of days? Honestly, I could forget all this Silent bullshit, lose my identity, and go anywhere.* Then he remembered Beth’s face and, in righteous rage, grew resolute. 

 

Finally, practice ended. “I expect you pussies to try harder!” the coach shouted, before stomping his way off the field. 

 

“Hey, hold up a second!” Vic shouted to the players, rushing onto the field-encircling four hundred-meter track, intercepting the Squids as they trod toward their locker room. 

 

“Yo, whadda you want?” asked a sweaty African American, whom Vic recognized as Javon Johns from the newscast. 

 

Vic waited for somebody to call him “fruit” or “faggot,” but the team just stared, grass-stained and reeking, exhausted. “Yeah, I’ve got a couple questions for you guys.” 

 

Still no insults. Maybe the fight song humiliation had affected them after all. “Ask ’em then,” grumbled a large Caucasian, sporting a surprisingly full beard for a high schooler. *Was this guy at the motel?* Vic wondered. *I don’t remember him being there. Maybe he replaced one of the dead players.*   

 

“Okey-doke. First off, why the bullshit?” 

 

“Bullshit?” a linebacker asked. 

 

“Yeah, bullshit. More specifically, why did you guys claim that al-Qaeda made you do the ol’ dongs out sing-along?”

 

At that, a pulsation seemed to pass through the Squids. Gazes dropped; awkward shuffling commenced. 

 

“Them muthafuckas wore turbans, boy,” Javon eventually answered. “The fuck we supposed ta call ’em?”  

 

“Surgical masks with painted on ape fingers hardly qualify as turbans. I know what really happened. Y’all drove to a motel for a slice of whore, only to end up ambushed by a robot and his creepy cronies.”

 

“Yo, what’s this dude talkin’ about?” the bearded new guy asked. “You guys weren’t lyin’ all this time, were you?”

 

The other players, feeling their deceit unraveling, reached the same conclusion: *This guy was there that day.* Rage bent their features; hands curled into fists. Soon, they’d be upon Vic. 

 

“I know what you’re thinking,” Vic said. “Let’s kill this little fuckbag, and cling to our daydream forever.” He pulled the Ruger from his waistband, letting it twinkle under the dipping sun. “But I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Sure, you’ll eventually kill me, but at least one of y’all is getting their pecker shot off first. Besides, I’m not your enemy here. Believe it or not, I’m tryin’ to help you. So, so, so…let’s try again. Why blame al-Qaeda? Sure, they’re not exactly nuns, but aren’t those dudes already infamous enough as it is? What the dilly-o?” 

 

“Yo, we ain’t gotta tell you shit,” replied the most roided out Asian American that Vic had ever seen. 

 

“No, you don’t. I won’t even try to kill you. But think about it for a second. Once, you were the kings of this crappy little campus, but look at you now. Everybody under the sun has seen your willies. For some of you, that might be a point of pride. ‘Yeah, I’m tripod status,’ you might brag, ignoring the fact that you let a bunch of nerds punk you. For the rest of you, though…I mean, holy shrink ray, Batman. Lookin’ like a grass shrimp.”

 

Embarrassed yet livid, they shuffled and muttered. 

 

“Nah, I’m not tryin’ to clown you. Honestly, I’m not exactly Ron Jeremy myself. What I’m getting at, though, is that revenge is a possibility for *all of us*. That group that made you sing au naturel…well, they’ve been messing with me for a while now. So, one last time I ask you…why did you lie on the news?”

 

“Money, dog,” Javon muttered, barely audible. “A thousand dollars each, man. What the hell were we supposed to do?”

 

“See, now we’re gettin’ somewhere. Who paid you?” 

 

“This dude. Before the cops even showed up, there he was—like he came from the shadows, or somethin’. Homeboy was *all decked out*: custom-fitted suit, fly ass Rolex. I mean, for a corny ass white man, dude was stylin’.” 

 

The jocks nodded in agreement. 

 

“Okay, so he was *GQ* status. What else can you tell me?”

 

“Well, ya know, our two homies were dead, right? Some of us—not this here pimp, *obviously*, but some of us—were cryin’ straight bitch style. But this dude, he was Mr. Smooth. Them corpses didn’t even bother him, brah. He’s like, ‘I’m sorry for your losses,’ but, I swear, that boy was grinnin’. Then he asks us about our finances. So we’re like, ‘The fuck’s this dude gettin’ at?’ I mean, some of us were still puttin’ our clothes on, nah mean? But he’s like, ‘I know that you gentlemen have experienced some trauma, but perhaps you can profit from it. I’m going to tell you a story. If you repeat it for me, to the cops and every single reporter that approaches you, I’ll give each of you one thousand dollars.’ I mean, on the real, it’s hard to get that skrilla when we’re practicing 24/7. Them pockets been dusty, nahm sayin’?” 

 

“I think so.”    

 

“I mean…we were still staggered from them roofies, so our thoughts were all slow and shit. But the dude just kept tellin’ us: al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda. Eventually, we’re talkin’ and…man, we all be wantin’ that dough. So we’re like, ‘Yeah, brah, you give us them greenbacks, we’ll tell ’em whatever you want.’”

 

“Okay, okay. And since you never retracted those statements, I’m assuming that he came through with the money.” 

 

The Squids nodded. 

 

“How did he get it to you?”

 

“He dropped by our next practice,” the buff Asian American contributed. “Yeah, the guy called us over to his Lexus, where he had all these Benjamins bundled up, and handed us each a stack. Man, we tore the strip club up that night.” 

 

“And you never got the dude’s name?”

 

“Nope.” 

 

“Hmmm. What about his license plate number?”

 

“Man, why would we give a shit?” Javon laughed. 

 

“Hey, wait a minute,” the smallest jock interjected. “Didn’t you take that celly snap, Mark?” 

 

“Aw, that’s right,” a wispy-mustached African American admitted. “Showin’ off them hundreds, baby. Come to think of it, the back of the dude’s Lexus was in the shot. I might even have gotten his license plate.”

 

“You mind if I see it?”

 

“Yeah, boy, I got that in my locker. Follow us.”

 

Reluctantly, Vic did. 

 

*That’s where they dangled Marty from*, Vic realized, scrutinizing empty ceiling space. *I can’t turn my back on these guys, or I’ll end up tormented.* 

 

A cellphone was thrust before him. Indeed, beneath the arms of a cash-brandishing football player, in the photograph’s lower left corner, a license plate was visible. With a mental mantra, Vic committed the vehicular identification number to memory. “Alright, we’re almost done here. Before I take off, though, I need a description. You said that the guy’s a snappy dresser, but what does he actually look like?”

 

“Well, ya know, dude was one of them pretty boy types,” Javon eventually answered. “I mean, no homo, but the boy had them cheekbones, like one of them actors, or whatevsky. Short blonde hair, shaved with precision. Not buff, but not chubby either.”

 

“Yeah, that’s good enough. I have to say, you guys have been surprisingly cooperative.”

 

“Fuck you, brah. Kill yourself.” 

 

“Not myself, no…but, believe me, these hands might soon kill. I’m goin’ after the bastards behind this, the ones who tricked introverts into attacking you, claiming that it would make a difference. This guy who paid you…deep down, you all know that he had something to do with it. For a measly thousand bucks apiece, these scumfucks turned you into laughingstocks. Don’t you want payback?” 

 

The Squids hemmed and hawed, but eventually repressed rage resurfaced. “Fuck that guy!” one bellowed. 

 

Vic had them. 

 

“Okay, I have my signal jammer on right now, but, otherwise, they could be watchin’ us. Stay paranoid, guys, and we might actually pull this off. I’m gonna investigate your moneyman. If I can figure out his identity, I can formulate a plan. If so, I’ll write it down and tape it under the bleachers. At this time tomorrow, go visit that dead drop, and we might all find the vengeance we crave. And, for the love of God, speak nothing of this over the phone.”

 

On that note, he left. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

*Damn, I’m gonna have to use another payphone*, Vic realized. *The second that I turn my celly on, they can track me. Careful, man. You’re dancing on the edge of oblivion. ‘Edge of Oblivion.’ Wasn’t that some crappy sci-fi movie? Don’t think about it, Vicster. Now’s not the time.* 

 

And there one was, a graffiti-blemished relic standing outside a grubby drive-through carwash. From his glove box, Vic fished out his insurance provider’s phone number. Exiting, he grabbed a fistful of change. 

 

After many minutes of hold music hell, Vic was speaking with a presumably live human. “Yeah, some jackass just hit my car and drove off,” he told them, after relating some personal information. “Uh-huh, uh-huh. Sure. He was a clean-cut sort of fella, blonde haired and vaguely fit. The guy drove a green Lexus with the license plate, uh…” *Damn, why didn’t I write it down?* he wondered. *C’mon, Vic, think.* Remembering the alphanumeric code, Vic recited. 

 

Promising that he’d look into it, the insurance drone provided Vic with a claim number. 

 

“My phone’s not working right now. Can I call you back later?” 

 

“Sure thing. We’ll identify the vehicle’s owner and contact their insurance provider. Give us a ring tomorrow morning, at any time after eight, and we should have some information for you. If you haven’t already, make sure to file an accident report with the police.”

 

“Yeah, I will.” *Fat chance, asshole.* “Talk to you tomorrow.” 

 

He hung up, wishing for a shower to call his own. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

*Last morning before the last morning*, Vic thought, parting crusted-over eyelids, feeling like an old landfill phonebook. His car was sweltering, and his unwashed attire seemed to be growing into his skin. Still, righteous plasma flowed throughout him. *Vic the Volcano, primed to erupt*, he thought.  

 

First, he called his insurance provider. After reciting the same information that he’d provided the previous day, plus his claim number, he was met with vocalized bewilderment: “Well, Mr. Dickens, we contacted the vehicle’s owner, Mr. Rockford Smith, and he claims that he never hit you. He sent us a photograph of his Lexus, and the car appears unscratched. Furthermore, we contacted your local police department, and it seems that you never filed an accident report. Are you being truthful with us, Mr. Dickens?”

 

“Huh…never mind then,” he mumbled, hanging up. *Well, they’ll be canceling my policy now, but at least I got the name. Rockford Smith…sounds like a porn star’s moniker. Or would that be Rockford Stiff? Let’s just hope that this scumfuck’s on social media. Then again, what douchebags aren’t these days? He knows that I’m after him now, so I’ll have to attempt some intellect here.*  

 

Climbing into his now uninsured Taurus, Vic hollered, “To the library!” 

 

Outside the liquor store, near the outskirts payphone that Vic had used, a patchwork wino belched, then fell face-first into his own vomit. *Splorsh*.

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Vic didn’t know why he’d held onto his library card—having visited there only once, to borrow texts for a high school term paper—but there it was, in his wallet behind a years-defunct bookstore’s club card. Just over his dashboard, the building loomed, its insulated glass exterior coated in grime and bird shit. A mass of twitching jitters, Vic crossed the windswept parking lot. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Plopping afore a computer terminal, he entered his name and patron identification number. *Time for a little web search*, he thought. *God, I hope that the Silent Minority can’t track me here. How far does their evil eye see?* 

 

Resisting the urge to check his email, Vic looked up Rockford Smith. There were more of them than he’d anticipated. After adding his state and city to the search, Vic had his man. On a business-focused social networking site, Rockford had posted a profile. He worked for Skewlclips, it turned out, as the executive assistant of the chairman and chief executive officer, Skip Elliot. 

 

*Ain’t that a bucket of craziness*, Vic thought. *This dude works for the same company that Orson tried to warn me about. Something sinister is going on here.*

 

Next, Vic looked up Skewlclips. Unfortunately, one of the top results was an article, “Skewlclips Exposes Terrorist Network.” His stomach heaving, Vic clicked the link.  

 

The story, written by Newt Bradley, read: 

 

*This morning, the National Security Agency released a statement, settling months of speculation. A new branch of al-Qaeda is operating inside the United States, they reported, and is using a popular video-sharing website to attract fresh militants.*  

 

*According to the statement, Skip Elliot—the CEO of Skewlclips—came forward after discovering dozens of videos being exchanged between Hazeem Smith, Orson Brown, and others they’ve identified as Matilda Grieves, Elizabeth Glass, Victor Dickens, Marty MacNamara, and Salamasina Savea.* 

 

*The latter five terrorists are currently at large, the NSA stated. If any American knows of their whereabouts, the agency requests that they immediately contact authorities, so that the group can be quickly apprehended.*

 

There, at the bottom of the page, was Vic’s senior portrait, alongside photos of Matilda, Marty, Elizabeth and Salamasina. *Sally Mass, I’m sorry*, Vic thought. *Those bastards got you too, didn’t they? And Beth, are you even alive? Please be.* 

 

Vic knew that he should flee. Though the library held few visitors, somebody might have read the paper, or seen his face on TV. Were wide eyes observing him? Were trembling forefingers dialing 911? *No, I have to finish*, he thought. *Is Skip Elliot the evil mastermind behind all of this, or just another link in the chain?*   

 

To uncover the truth, Vic ran a search on Skip Elliot. After perusing much biographical bullshit—Harvard this, charity that—he unearthed a fresh video, posted just minutes prior. There was Skip, positioned behind a lectern bearing the Skewclips logo: a stylized *SK*. After some introductory blather, the man got down to business, saying, “Since the al-Qaeda video incident, many concerned users have contacted our company, asking if we’ve been monitoring your videos all this time. Right now, you are likely imagining yourself trapped within some Orwellian nightmare, with an impersonal government entity monitoring your every move. Well, rest assured. We have been monitoring you, but only for *your* benefit.”

 

Vic paused the video, wondering, *Those last sentences, where have I heard them before?* Then it dawned on him: *Holy shit, it was in the DAY OF THE INTROVERT pamphlet*. *Did this dude write the thing? At the very least, he’s read it.*   

 

Concluding, Skip made assurances that only professional security experts were monitoring Skewlclips videos, for the sole purpose of rooting out domestic terrorism.   

 

*Man, something stinks here*, Vic thought. *Time to read up on Skewlclips.* Seconds later, he was viewing the company’s history. 

 

Apparently, Skewlclips had been founded in 2005, spreading from one college to the next, exponentially acquiring users, earning billions in ad revenue. An interesting factoid surfaced. Skewlclips had a parent company: Investutech. 

 

*Oh, hell no*, Vic thought. *Is that what this is, one of those evil-company-that-secretly-controls-the-world dealies? Fuckin’ Investutech.* 

 

Everybody knew Investutech. The company’s logo was everywhere: billboards, ads, stadiums, convention centers, half of the consumer technology currently in use. Celebrities endorsed it; Hollywood blockbusters pimped its products like crazy. 

 

Investutech was the top innovator in many fields, ranging from everyday consumer products to fringe sciences so advanced that they seemed more like sorcery. Its annual budget stretched into the billions; its patents were myriad. Supposedly, a coalition of the world’s wealthiest billionaires had funded Investutech, though their identities remained undisclosed. Over the years, the multinational conglomerate had plundered Silicon Valley, swallowing startups by the dozen. 

 

Calling up a list of Investutech subsidiaries, Vic found nearly one hundred companies listed. Scrolling through the list, he noticed three of interest: Meteor Armaments Company, Stunnervations, Inc., and XBC. 

 

*So they’re making toys and guns, and seemingly controlling the media*, Vic thought. *Is that why they gave us Ruger firearms, to associate their competition with terrorists? Come to think of it, every major Silent story was exclusive to XBC. That’s where Nanny Gaines is televised, too. This al-Qaeda nonsense drove XBC’s ratings up, increasing their ad revenue. So all the lies, all this death and misery was…what, a ploy to fatten up Investutech’s bottom line? How much money does one company need?*

 

Another subsidiary caught his eye: InVo Music Group, the world’s largest music corporation. The company owned dozens of record labels, including Rap Nasty, Bebop Steady, Substratal, and Diva Classics. *Holy crap*, Vic thought. *All that terrible mainstream music that I’ve been hearing—“Shamdiggly,” “Beep, Beep, Beep,” “Dem Showah Boyz,” and all the rest—can be traced back to Investutech. What, are they trying to dumb humanity down to make consumers more compliant?*     

 

*Man, this is too much. Battling Investutech is like trying to fistfight the ocean. But maybe I can take Skip Elliot down, and rescue Beth and Salamasina…if they’re still alive. I don’t know if I can clear our names, but I’ve gotta try something. Time to get out of here, devise a plan, and get a message to the Squids. Think, Vicster, think.* ",2,1771699865.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

There came a stirring in the shadows, a furtive tread, and a grunt. Though swathed in slumber, some portion of Vic’s mentality had anticipated a home invasion. His adrenaline surged, bringing instant alertness. Awakening, he discovered himself still spooning Beth, both of them completely dressed—wearing shoes, even.

 

There was a thump near the foot of the bed. *Somebody else is in the room!* was Vic’s realization. *Oh, shit! The signal jammer!*

 

He couldn’t remember where he’d left it. Was it in Beth’s living room? Beneath the bed? *No, it must be near the couch somewhere. That’s where I activated it, back when I thought that sex with Beth was a possibility.*  

 

Cat-silent, he reached over, hand-searching the nightstand for its table lamp. Then came illumination, revealing—big surprise—a guy wearing a monkey finger surgical mask, dressed in black clothing.

 

Two shock-widened oculi swung toward Vic, but Vic was already in motion. Tackling the intruder to the ground, he then flailed at his face, slapping and punching like a rabid baboon, until the man’s eyes rolled back. 

 

*Should I kill him?* Vic wondered. *Might as well.* He jumped to standing. 

 

One time, back in high school, Vic had observed a group of local skateboarders half-assedly attempting to grind a five-stair handrail. After one longhaired fella tired of repeatedly shooting his board out, too cowardly to keep his body above it, he’d commenced an embarrassing tantrum, shrieking and flailing like a petulant child. Finally, he’d stomped his skateboard, snapping it out of spite. 

 

Mimicking that lady pants-wearing scumfuck, Vic stomped. Beneath his sneaker, a face imploded, like an eggshell filled with sodden meat.   

 

*This is it*, he thought. *I don’t know where I’m going, but I can’t stay here after this. I need to grab the jammer, and then hit my apartment for that gun and some clothing. I’ll bring Beth and Orson. If they kick in some gas money, we can leave Scumfuck City forever. We’ll head to Florida, get my new debit card from my parents, and hang around for a while. Our pale asses need some sun, anyway.* 

 

He woke Beth with a kiss, which, this time, she let go on for a bit. Vic even slipped his tongue in, rooting around her point of severance. *You know, this isn’t bad*, he thought. *A little dry, but nice.*

 

Placing her hand on his cheek, Beth blinked herself awake. If only that moment could have lasted.  

 

“They’ve come for us,” he informed her. “There’s a corpse on the floor, and we’ll be joining that bastard in Hell if we don’t get out of here. It’s finally time to leave this scum pit.”

 

With relief in her eyes, she nodded. 

 

“Pack everything you wanna keep. We won’t be coming back. Hey, I’m gonna run to my apartment for a few things, and then stop by Orson’s place. We’ll take him with us, and maybe Salamasina, if she wants to go. Do you still have the Ruger they gave you?”

 

She nodded.    

 

“Do you know how to use it?”

 

Again, she nodded. 

 

“Good. Load it and keep it near. If anybody but me shows up, put a bullet through their forehead. These bastards are wearing bulletproof vests.”

 

He kissed her again, and then rummaged in the living room, searching for the signal jammer. It wasn’t on the coffee table or the sofa. Under the couch, however, Vic spotted a blinking red light. 

 

*Good, it’s still on*, he thought. *I must have accidentally kicked it under there. That’s why that Silent bastard couldn’t find it.* 

 

Pocketing the device, Vic sprinted to his apartment. *No intruders*, he realized. *Make this quick, Vicster.* First, he loaded his Ruger. His Samsonite duffle bag yet contained many .357 Magnum rounds. Into it, Vic added clothing—socks, boxers, shirts and pants—grabbed at random. Everything else, he abandoned. 

 

When his knocking went unanswered, Vic shrugged, and kicked Orson’s door in. No Orson in sight. In the guy’s bedroom, Vic found blood and shattered teeth. *Did they get him?* he wondered. *Are those Orson’s remnants, or some Silent scumfuck’s? Fuck it, I’m out of here.* 

 

Remembering the time he’d borrowed gas funds from Orson, Vic checked the kitchen cupboard before leaving, finding a coffee can stuffed with small bills. Pocketing the funds, he thought, *Sorry, buddy, but you might be dead, and we’ll need this.* 

 

He ran back to Beth’s apartment. The Silent corpse was missing, as was Beth. Discovering an open gym bag, Vic howled and punched his own head. *You stupid bastard!* he self-admonished. *How many horror movies have you seen? You never, ever, ever leave a female unattended! Now they got her, and there’s not one muthafuckin’ thing I can do about it! I have to figure out how to save her.*

 

Pulling the Ruger from his pocket, Vic did the ol’ secret agent bit, becoming a silent shadow, sliding around corners—gun ready, eye-sweeping the *mise-en-scène*. That’s how he imagined it, anyway. 

 

The truth was, with the shouldered duffle bag throwing his balance off, Vic’s stealth became blundering slapstick. So when masked Silent began pouring from their apartments, only Vic’s proximity to the stairwell made the parking garage reachable. Into his car he hurried, keying the engine, then coasting up to the security gate. For one nightmarish instant, Vic feared that they’d deactivated it. But after a key card sensor swipe, the barrier squealed and lurched open. 

 

Silent fell upon his Taurus, attempting to wrench its doors open, battering at Vic through its lowered window. Stomping the accelerator, he sped from the complex, flinging away six clinging Silent, who seemed to revolve in slow motion, visual poetry, before they hit concrete. Hearing gunshots, he quick-glanced behind him to see his rear windshield spiderwebbed. 

 

Speeding into unknown circumstances, he watched the blood moon meet the horizon.  



 

**Chapter 17**

 

Vic spent the ensuing day in his vehicle, immobile in various parking lots, moving every time somebody took note of him. Fearing that the Silent Minority had placed a GPS tracker on his car’s underside, he left the signal jammer running, charging it with a USB charger that he picked up on the cheap. 

 

That night, alternating between terror cringes and rage shudders, he drank himself insensate. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Awakening the next morning—sweaty and uncomfortable, his head throbbing—he realized: *Just two more days until they strike. Introverts against a frat house…another ridiculous charade. There’s got to be a way I can use that.*

 

He pulled up to a gas station, and therein bought some coffee. Outside the establishment, a newspaper vending machine caught his eye. On the paper’s front page, a familiar face grimaced. *Oh, Orson. What did those monsters do to you?*

 

Naturally, he bought a copy, and read:

 

***COAST MALL MASSACRE!*** 

 

*Yesterday morning, tragedy stuck Southern California’s Coast Mall, resulting in three hundred and fourteen fatalities. A single shooter, identified by authorities as Orson Brown, age thirty-six, gunned down every shopper, storeowner, employee, and security guard in the complex. There were no survivors.* 

 

“Bullshit,” Vic muttered. “Orson wasn’t the fuckin’ Terminator. What, did the dude have a magical, self-replenishing ammo supply? Give me a fuckin’ break.” Noticing a sea hag staring, he finished the article in silence. 

 

*Hours prior to his rampage, Brown uploaded a disturbing video to his freshly-created Skewlclips page, which featured him running naked through an unidentified apartment complex, brandishing the revolver he would later use to commit suicide. He also posted dozens of hateful rants, extolling Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden, promising to make them proud.*

 

*Investigators are currently looking into Brown’s recent whereabouts, hoping to identify the shooter’s accomplices, and determine whether his killing spree was part of the al-Qaeda attacks plaguing our nation of late.* 

 

His face rippling with suppressed emotion, Vic walked to his car. Something surged within him, a bile uprush, which he knelt and ejected beside the driver’s side door. Swiveling his glance from the vomit, he noticed a message finger-scrawled in the Taurus’ door dust: *SKEWLCLIPS*.

 

*Orson must have written that*, he realized. *It’s some kind of warning, I bet. Did he know that those bastards were gonna frame him? I’ll look into Skewlclips later. For now, I’ve got some jocks to visit.*   



\* \* \* \* \*

 

From East Pacific High School’s bleachers, Vic watched football practice wind down. Unenthusiastically, the Squids ran the same play over and over, as their beet-faced coach blew a shiny whistle and shouted inarticulately. 

 

From a solitary payphone, Vic had called the school that morning, claiming to be a talent scout hoping to observe players covertly, to see if they had true heart. Luckily, the secretary had believed him. “They’re practicin’ after school,” she’d remarked. 

 

*Damn, this is boring*, Vic thought. *Is this really how I wanna spend my last couple of days? Honestly, I could forget all this Silent bullshit, lose my identity, and go anywhere.* Then he remembered Beth’s face and, in righteous rage, grew resolute. 

 

Finally, practice ended. “I expect you pussies to try harder!” the coach shouted, before stomping his way off the field. 

 

“Hey, hold up a second!” Vic shouted to the players, rushing onto the field-encircling four hundred-meter track, intercepting the Squids as they trod toward their locker room. 

 

“Yo, whadda you want?” asked a sweaty African American, whom Vic recognized as Javon Johns from the newscast. 

 

Vic waited for somebody to call him “fruit” or “faggot,” but the team just stared, grass-stained and reeking, exhausted. “Yeah, I’ve got a couple questions for you guys.” 

 

Still no insults. Maybe the fight song humiliation had affected them after all. “Ask ’em then,” grumbled a large Caucasian, sporting a surprisingly full beard for a high schooler. *Was this guy at the motel?* Vic wondered. *I don’t remember him being there. Maybe he replaced one of the dead players.*   

 

“Okey-doke. First off, why the bullshit?” 

 

“Bullshit?” a linebacker asked. 

 

“Yeah, bullshit. More specifically, why did you guys claim that al-Qaeda made you do the ol’ dongs out sing-along?”

 

At that, a pulsation seemed to pass through the Squids. Gazes dropped; awkward shuffling commenced. 

 

“Them muthafuckas wore turbans, boy,” Javon eventually answered. “The fuck we supposed ta call ’em?”  

 

“Surgical masks with painted on ape fingers hardly qualify as turbans. I know what really happened. Y’all drove to a motel for a slice of whore, only to end up ambushed by a robot and his creepy cronies.”

 

“Yo, what’s this dude talkin’ about?” the bearded new guy asked. “You guys weren’t lyin’ all this time, were you?”

 

The other players, feeling their deceit unraveling, reached the same conclusion: *This guy was there that day.* Rage bent their features; hands curled into fists. Soon, they’d be upon Vic. 

 

“I know what you’re thinking,” Vic said. “Let’s kill this little fuckbag, and cling to our daydream forever.” He pulled the Ruger from his waistband, letting it twinkle under the dipping sun. “But I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Sure, you’ll eventually kill me, but at least one of y’all is getting their pecker shot off first. Besides, I’m not your enemy here. Believe it or not, I’m tryin’ to help you. So, so, so…let’s try again. Why blame al-Qaeda? Sure, they’re not exactly nuns, but aren’t those dudes already infamous enough as it is? What the dilly-o?” 

 

“Yo, we ain’t gotta tell you shit,” replied the most roided out Asian American that Vic had ever seen. 

 

“No, you don’t. I won’t even try to kill you. But think about it for a second. Once, you were the kings of this crappy little campus, but look at you now. Everybody under the sun has seen your willies. For some of you, that might be a point of pride. ‘Yeah, I’m tripod status,’ you might brag, ignoring the fact that you let a bunch of nerds punk you. For the rest of you, though…I mean, holy shrink ray, Batman. Lookin’ like a grass shrimp.”

 

Embarrassed yet livid, they shuffled and muttered. 

 

“Nah, I’m not tryin’ to clown you. Honestly, I’m not exactly Ron Jeremy myself. What I’m getting at, though, is that revenge is a possibility for *all of us*. That group that made you sing au naturel…well, they’ve been messing with me for a while now. So, one last time I ask you…why did you lie on the news?”

 

“Money, dog,” Javon muttered, barely audible. “A thousand dollars each, man. What the hell were we supposed to do?”

 

“See, now we’re gettin’ somewhere. Who paid you?” 

 

“This dude. Before the cops even showed up, there he was—like he came from the shadows, or somethin’. Homeboy was *all decked out*: custom-fitted suit, fly ass Rolex. I mean, for a corny ass white man, dude was stylin’.” 

 

The jocks nodded in agreement. 

 

“Okay, so he was *GQ* status. What else can you tell me?”

 

“Well, ya know, our two homies were dead, right? Some of us—not this here pimp, *obviously*, but some of us—were cryin’ straight bitch style. But this dude, he was Mr. Smooth. Them corpses didn’t even bother him, brah. He’s like, ‘I’m sorry for your losses,’ but, I swear, that boy was grinnin’. Then he asks us about our finances. So we’re like, ‘The fuck’s this dude gettin’ at?’ I mean, some of us were still puttin’ our clothes on, nah mean? But he’s like, ‘I know that you gentlemen have experienced some trauma, but perhaps you can profit from it. I’m going to tell you a story. If you repeat it for me, to the cops and every single reporter that approaches you, I’ll give each of you one thousand dollars.’ I mean, on the real, it’s hard to get that skrilla when we’re practicing 24/7. Them pockets been dusty, nahm sayin’?” 

 

“I think so.”    

 

“I mean…we were still staggered from them roofies, so our thoughts were all slow and shit. But the dude just kept tellin’ us: al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda. Eventually, we’re talkin’ and…man, we all be wantin’ that dough. So we’re like, ‘Yeah, brah, you give us them greenbacks, we’ll tell ’em whatever you want.’”

 

“Okay, okay. And since you never retracted those statements, I’m assuming that he came through with the money.” 

 

The Squids nodded. 

 

“How did he get it to you?”

 

“He dropped by our next practice,” the buff Asian American contributed. “Yeah, the guy called us over to his Lexus, where he had all these Benjamins bundled up, and handed us each a stack. Man, we tore the strip club up that night.” 

 

“And you never got the dude’s name?”

 

“Nope.” 

 

“Hmmm. What about his license plate number?”

 

“Man, why would we give a shit?” Javon laughed. 

 

“Hey, wait a minute,” the smallest jock interjected. “Didn’t you take that celly snap, Mark?” 

 

“Aw, that’s right,” a wispy-mustached African American admitted. “Showin’ off them hundreds, baby. Come to think of it, the back of the dude’s Lexus was in the shot. I might even have gotten his license plate.”

 

“You mind if I see it?”

 

“Yeah, boy, I got that in my locker. Follow us.”

 

Reluctantly, Vic did. 

 

*That’s where they dangled Marty from*, Vic realized, scrutinizing empty ceiling space. *I can’t turn my back on these guys, or I’ll end up tormented.* 

 

A cellphone was thrust before him. Indeed, beneath the arms of a cash-brandishing football player, in the photograph’s lower left corner, a license plate was visible. With a mental mantra, Vic committed the vehicular identification number to memory. “Alright, we’re almost done here. Before I take off, though, I need a description. You said that the guy’s a snappy dresser, but what does he actually look like?”

 

“Well, ya know, dude was one of them pretty boy types,” Javon eventually answered. “I mean, no homo, but the boy had them cheekbones, like one of them actors, or whatevsky. Short blonde hair, shaved with precision. Not buff, but not chubby either.”

 

“Yeah, that’s good enough. I have to say, you guys have been surprisingly cooperative.”

 

“Fuck you, brah. Kill yourself.” 

 

“Not myself, no…but, believe me, these hands might soon kill. I’m goin’ after the bastards behind this, the ones who tricked introverts into attacking you, claiming that it would make a difference. This guy who paid you…deep down, you all know that he had something to do with it. For a measly thousand bucks apiece, these scumfucks turned you into laughingstocks. Don’t you want payback?” 

 

The Squids hemmed and hawed, but eventually repressed rage resurfaced. “Fuck that guy!” one bellowed. 

 

Vic had them. 

 

“Okay, I have my signal jammer on right now, but, otherwise, they could be watchin’ us. Stay paranoid, guys, and we might actually pull this off. I’m gonna investigate your moneyman. If I can figure out his identity, I can formulate a plan. If so, I’ll write it down and tape it under the bleachers. At this time tomorrow, go visit that dead drop, and we might all find the vengeance we crave. And, for the love of God, speak nothing of this over the phone.”

 

On that note, he left. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

*Damn, I’m gonna have to use another payphone*, Vic realized. *The second that I turn my celly on, they can track me. Careful, man. You’re dancing on the edge of oblivion. ‘Edge of Oblivion.’ Wasn’t that some crappy sci-fi movie? Don’t think about it, Vicster. Now’s not the time.* 

 

And there one was, a graffiti-blemished relic standing outside a grubby drive-through carwash. From his glove box, Vic fished out his insurance provider’s phone number. Exiting, he grabbed a fistful of change. 

 

After many minutes of hold music hell, Vic was speaking with a presumably live human. “Yeah, some jackass just hit my car and drove off,” he told them, after relating some personal information. “Uh-huh, uh-huh. Sure. He was a clean-cut sort of fella, blonde haired and vaguely fit. The guy drove a green Lexus with the license plate, uh…” *Damn, why didn’t I write it down?* he wondered. *C’mon, Vic, think.* Remembering the alphanumeric code, Vic recited. 

 

Promising that he’d look into it, the insurance drone provided Vic with a claim number. 

 

“My phone’s not working right now. Can I call you back later?” 

 

“Sure thing. We’ll identify the vehicle’s owner and contact their insurance provider. Give us a ring tomorrow morning, at any time after eight, and we should have some information for you. If you haven’t already, make sure to file an accident report with the police.”

 

“Yeah, I will.” *Fat chance, asshole.* “Talk to you tomorrow.” 

 

He hung up, wishing for a shower to call his own. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

*Last morning before the last morning*, Vic thought, parting crusted-over eyelids, feeling like an old landfill phonebook. His car was sweltering, and his unwashed attire seemed to be growing into his skin. Still, righteous plasma flowed throughout him. *Vic the Volcano, primed to erupt*, he thought.  

 

First, he called his insurance provider. After reciting the same information that he’d provided the previous day, plus his claim number, he was met with vocalized bewilderment: “Well, Mr. Dickens, we contacted the vehicle’s owner, Mr. Rockford Smith, and he claims that he never hit you. He sent us a photograph of his Lexus, and the car appears unscratched. Furthermore, we contacted your local police department, and it seems that you never filed an accident report. Are you being truthful with us, Mr. Dickens?”

 

“Huh…never mind then,” he mumbled, hanging up. *Well, they’ll be canceling my policy now, but at least I got the name. Rockford Smith…sounds like a porn star’s moniker. Or would that be Rockford Stiff? Let’s just hope that this scumfuck’s on social media. Then again, what douchebags aren’t these days? He knows that I’m after him now, so I’ll have to attempt some intellect here.*  

 

Climbing into his now uninsured Taurus, Vic hollered, “To the library!” 

 

Outside the liquor store, near the outskirts payphone that Vic had used, a patchwork wino belched, then fell face-first into his own vomit. *Splorsh*.

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Vic didn’t know why he’d held onto his library card—having visited there only once, to borrow texts for a high school term paper—but there it was, in his wallet behind a years-defunct bookstore’s club card. Just over his dashboard, the building loomed, its insulated glass exterior coated in grime and bird shit. A mass of twitching jitters, Vic crossed the windswept parking lot. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Plopping afore a computer terminal, he entered his name and patron identification number. *Time for a little web search*, he thought. *God, I hope that the Silent Minority can’t track me here. How far does their evil eye see?* 

 

Resisting the urge to check his email, Vic looked up Rockford Smith. There were more of them than he’d anticipated. After adding his state and city to the search, Vic had his man. On a business-focused social networking site, Rockford had posted a profile. He worked for Skewlclips, it turned out, as the executive assistant of the chairman and chief executive officer, Skip Elliot. 

 

*Ain’t that a bucket of craziness*, Vic thought. *This dude works for the same company that Orson tried to warn me about. Something sinister is going on here.*

 

Next, Vic looked up Skewlclips. Unfortunately, one of the top results was an article, “Skewlclips Exposes Terrorist Network.” His stomach heaving, Vic clicked the link.  

 

The story, written by Newt Bradley, read: 

 

*This morning, the National Security Agency released a statement, settling months of speculation. A new branch of al-Qaeda is operating inside the United States, they reported, and is using a popular video-sharing website to attract fresh militants.*  

 

*According to the statement, Skip Elliot—the CEO of Skewlclips—came forward after discovering dozens of videos being exchanged between Hazeem Smith, Orson Brown, and others they’ve identified as Matilda Grieves, Elizabeth Glass, Victor Dickens, Marty MacNamara, and Salamasina Savea.* 

 

*The latter five terrorists are currently at large, the NSA stated. If any American knows of their whereabouts, the agency requests that they immediately contact authorities, so that the group can be quickly apprehended.*

 

There, at the bottom of the page, was Vic’s senior portrait, alongside photos of Matilda, Marty, Elizabeth and Salamasina. *Sally Mass, I’m sorry*, Vic thought. *Those bastards got you too, didn’t they? And Beth, are you even alive? Please be.* 

 

Vic knew that he should flee. Though the library held few visitors, somebody might have read the paper, or seen his face on TV. Were wide eyes observing him? Were trembling forefingers dialing 911? *No, I have to finish*, he thought. *Is Skip Elliot the evil mastermind behind all of this, or just another link in the chain?*   

 

To uncover the truth, Vic ran a search on Skip Elliot. After perusing much biographical bullshit—Harvard this, charity that—he unearthed a fresh video, posted just minutes prior. There was Skip, positioned behind a lectern bearing the Skewclips logo: a stylized *SK*. After some introductory blather, the man got down to business, saying, “Since the al-Qaeda video incident, many concerned users have contacted our company, asking if we’ve been monitoring your videos all this time. Right now, you are likely imagining yourself trapped within some Orwellian nightmare, with an impersonal government entity monitoring your every move. Well, rest assured. We have been monitoring you, but only for *your* benefit.”

 

Vic paused the video, wondering, *Those last sentences, where have I heard them before?* Then it dawned on him: *Holy shit, it was in the DAY OF THE INTROVERT pamphlet*. *Did this dude write the thing? At the very least, he’s read it.*   

 

Concluding, Skip made assurances that only professional security experts were monitoring Skewlclips videos, for the sole purpose of rooting out domestic terrorism.   

 

*Man, something stinks here*, Vic thought. *Time to read up on Skewlclips.* Seconds later, he was viewing the company’s history. 

 

Apparently, Skewlclips had been founded in 2005, spreading from one college to the next, exponentially acquiring users, earning billions in ad revenue. An interesting factoid surfaced. Skewlclips had a parent company: Investutech. 

 

*Oh, hell no*, Vic thought. *Is that what this is, one of those evil-company-that-secretly-controls-the-world dealies? Fuckin’ Investutech.* 

 

Everybody knew Investutech. The company’s logo was everywhere: billboards, ads, stadiums, convention centers, half of the consumer technology currently in use. Celebrities endorsed it; Hollywood blockbusters pimped its products like crazy. 

 

Investutech was the top innovator in many fields, ranging from everyday consumer products to fringe sciences so advanced that they seemed more like sorcery. Its annual budget stretched into the billions; its patents were myriad. Supposedly, a coalition of the world’s wealthiest billionaires had funded Investutech, though their identities remained undisclosed. Over the years, the multinational conglomerate had plundered Silicon Valley, swallowing startups by the dozen. 

 

Calling up a list of Investutech subsidiaries, Vic found nearly one hundred companies listed. Scrolling through the list, he noticed three of interest: Meteor Armaments Company, Stunnervations, Inc., and XBC. 

 

*So they’re making toys and guns, and seemingly controlling the media*, Vic thought. *Is that why they gave us Ruger firearms, to associate their competition with terrorists? Come to think of it, every major Silent story was exclusive to XBC. That’s where Nanny Gaines is televised, too. This al-Qaeda nonsense drove XBC’s ratings up, increasing their ad revenue. So all the lies, all this death and misery was…what, a ploy to fatten up Investutech’s bottom line? How much money does one company need?*

 

Another subsidiary caught his eye: InVo Music Group, the world’s largest music corporation. The company owned dozens of record labels, including Rap Nasty, Bebop Steady, Substratal, and Diva Classics. *Holy crap*, Vic thought. *All that terrible mainstream music that I’ve been hearing—“Shamdiggly,” “Beep, Beep, Beep,” “Dem Showah Boyz,” and all the rest—can be traced back to Investutech. What, are they trying to dumb humanity down to make consumers more compliant?*     

 

*Man, this is too much. Battling Investutech is like trying to fistfight the ocean. But maybe I can take Skip Elliot down, and rescue Beth and Salamasina…if they’re still alive. I don’t know if I can clear our names, but I’ve gotta try something. Time to get out of here, devise a plan, and get a message to the Squids. Think, Vicster, think.* ",2,1771699792.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

1raz0we,https://archive.ph/wHbpG,"ICE wants to send detained Tempe man to his death in Iran, lawyer says","If Mehrzad Asadi Eidivand is sent back to his home country of Iran, his attorney says, he will be executed. Immigration and Customs Enforcement appears deadset on sending the 41-year-old undocumented Tempe resident there anyway.

Eidivand has been in federal custody since June, when he and his wife were arrested by Homeland Security Investigations agents at their East Valley home. HSI, which is a division of ICE, showed up at the couple’s home without a warrant. Eidivand’s wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen named Linet Vartanniavartanians, called Tempe police. In 911 call audio, she could be heard threatening to shoot the HSI agents if they entered her property.

That led to their eventual arrest — Vartannianvartanians for threatening a federal agent and Eidivand for possession of a firearm as an undocumented immigrant. Eidivand’s immigration attorney, Rebecca Cheaves, believed the pair was targeted by HSI in retaliation for Eidivand’s brother going on a hunger strike while in immigration detention in Florence. At the time, Cheaves was representing the brother, who has since been granted asylum and is in the process of obtaining a green card.

In late November, Eidivand and Vartanniavartanians took plea deals and were released with time served and two years’ probation. Vartanniavartanians is now free, but Cheaves said Eividand was immediately detained by ICE. For the last three months, he’s been held at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico, California, a border town economically linked to the much larger nearby Mexican city of Mexicali.

Since Eidivand’s detention by ICE, agents have repeatedly signaled that they want to deport him to Iran by asking him to sign a deportation order without the presence of his attorney, Cheaves said. But back in Iran, she said, Eidivand faces an execution order because of his views against the country’s Islamist regime.

ICE acknowledged but did not respond to a request for comment.

According to Cheaves, the Iranian government issued the order against him in 2010 and delivered it to his family’s home in the country. She said she was not authorized to share a copy of that order with Phoenix New Times. 

As early as 2003, according to a relative who spoke to New Times on the condition of anonymity, Eidivand began speaking out against the Iranian government, which led the regime to call for his arrest. Similar to a warrant, the order requires Eidivand to present himself for execution, or else the government will be looking to locate and kill him for the rest of his life. These types of orders never expire. 

“He would be killed if he were returned to Iran,” Cheaves said. “ICE doesn’t care. They actually told him in custody that they didn’t care if he died.” 

Eidivand fled Iran and traveled through several countries — including Turkey, Spain, Guatemala and Mexico — before arriving in the U.S. in 2012. In 2013, an immigration judge ordered him to voluntarily depart the country. Eidivand unsuccessfully appealed that ruling and has remained in the country. Cheaves has filed a motion for a stay of his removal proceedings and a motion to reopen his case with the Board of Immigration Appeals, arguing he didn’t have a fair shot to present his asylum case.

Cheaves said she has struggled to get any type of response from ICE about the status of her client’s case. She claimed that Eidivand’s prior immigration attorney failed to present his asylum case, including failing to show the judge his execution order. If the judge had seen that order, Cheaves said, “no immigration judge would have removed him to Iran.”

Since Eidivand left Iran, the Iranian government has only grown harsher toward dissenters. In late December, protests erupted nationwide amid an economic collapse that saw rapid food price inflation and extreme unemployment. Protesters called for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic, which resulted in a harsh, violent government crackdown. The government instituted internet blackouts and the regime killed more than 7,000 people, with hundreds of thousands more injured or arrested.

President Donald Trump has warned Iran that the U.S. may take military action in response to the crackdown on peaceful protesters, and the U.S. has instituted additional tariffs against the country. Despite that, the Trump administration deported 14 Iranians, some of whom would face similar danger to Eidivand, back to the country in late January.

Cheaves worries her client could be next. 

“I’m doing everything I can to try to stop the deportation,” she said. “He’s very afraid that they’re going to come to him at any moment and just put him on a plane.” 

The fear that he could be scooped up and deported in the middle of the night has taken a significant toll on Eidivand’s mental and physical health, Cheaves said. So have the detention center’s squalid conditions, which Cheaves called “abusive” and inhumane.

In the last four months, two Imperial Regional Detention Center detainees, Luis Beltrán Yanez‑Cruz and Huabing Xie, have died from heart attacks.

During his transfer to Imperial Regional Detention Center, Eidivand’s family lost contact with him for three days as he was moved from Colorado to Los Angeles, back to Florence and then back to California. He wore the same clothes throughout the transfer and was denied blankets despite fighting a sickness that would turn out to be a severe case of COVID-19, Cheaves said.

Soon after arriving in Calexico, Eidivand’s relative said Eidivand fell down multiple times, began throwing up blood and landed in the hospital. He’s back in detention now and has been there for three months, but conditions haven’t been any better.

His health has continued to plummet, Cheaves said. An unknown lump formed on his chest. The relative said he’s been denied access to a doctor — staffers have claimed to him that the facility has only nurses — and to medication for his chronic back pain. He’s been unable to get more than two or three hours of sleep a night.

Due to his dietary restrictions, Eidivand cannot digest anything that has lactose or carbohydrates, his relative said. The detention center hasn’t accommodated this, limiting Eidivand to consuming only water, coffee, peanut butter and occasionally chicken for three months.

Eidivand’s mental health has also deteriorated. He calls his family less often and has made concerning remarks during these calls, said the relative. When they do speak, his family begs him to keep going and tries to distract him with “stupid stuff to make him laugh.”

“He’s like, ‘Unfortunately, I’m still alive,’” his relative recalled him saying in a recent phone call. “He keeps saying that over and over, even the last time, he told me, ‘You know what? I’m just done with this. And if they’re going to kill me, I’d rather die myself.’” 

The Imperial facility is run by Utah-based private prison company Management & Training Corporation. In a statement provided to New Times, company spokesperson Emily Lawhead “strongly dispute(d) the allegation that Imperial Regional Detention Facility fails to provide appropriate medical care, medication, or adequate nutrition.” She added that the facility adheres to ICE detention standards and is subject to regular oversight, though she said she could not comment on a specific individual’s medical treatment.

“Residents are provided three meals daily that are reviewed and approved by a registered dietitian,” Lawhead wrote. “The facility accommodates medically necessary and religious dietary requests in accordance with established procedures.”

Cheaves has been exploring other options to get Eidivand out of detention, including having him deported to another country that wouldn’t kill him as soon as he set foot on its soil. Mexican officials have said Eidivand can seek asylum there, but he needs to be there in person, Cheaves said. He’s currently locked up less than four miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.

“That’s where Mehrzad wants to go, Mexico,” Cheaves said. “He’s like, ‘I don’t even care if they don’t let me stay here, just send me to Mexico. I can live there with my wife.’ He doesn’t want to stay here. He wants to go to Mexico, where he feels like he can get better treatment.” 

Prior to his detention, Eidivand was a big Trump-fan that “loved the United States to death,” the relative said. “He actually believed what Trump said, that ‘I’m a patriot. I’m going to make this country a better place. I’m going to make it great again.’” But this experience has broken the MAGA spell. 

Now, Eidivand is begging the U.S. government to let him leave — and let him live.",2,1771699548.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,0,1.0,False

I'd say for about 6 years I have been dealing with pretty chronic nocturia, though I haven't been officially diagnosed with it.

I get up probably around a dozen times and I pee very small amounts.

The only possible thing that has helped is xanax, ativan, or ambien but I don't want to take them every night, so I do a few nights on, a few nights off.

I have been to 2 urologists, had a bladder ultrasound, had my PSA checked, etc.

All normal

I have tried medications: oxybutinin and myberteq; its possible I didn't stay on them long enough but the urologist didn't seem convinced based on my description that it would help.

It can be debilitating just in terms of how I feel the nexy day from lack of sleep.

I feel crazy; like its all in my head and that I can somehow just ignore the urge to go if I lay there but I pee, lay down and pop right back up again. I can eventually fall asleep but I inevitably wake up again.

GF mentioned trying pelvic floor training; urologist/doctor said unless I had actual leakeage, it wouldn't help.

It doesn't seem medical to me; it feels psychological and that I somehow need to break the pattern and habit but I don't know how and I feel crazy.

This sounds crazy but coud hypnosis help?

I do drink coffee but only in the mornings.

I drink beer usually only 1 at most and its about 2 hours before bed, which is what the urologist said to aim for in terms of liquids.

Please help.

1rayzwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenwriter/comments/1rayzwg/circles_circles_circles_circles_circles_circles/,Circles Circles Circles Circles Circles Circles Circles.,"Here came a young man, stepping inside a library, kicking the snow off his feet. He was wearing a topcoat, a hat, and holding an umbrella. He stood there on the welcome mat for a moment, staring at his feet, before he finally moved, first in small circles and then, stopping, seeming to see someone on the top floor, he smiled, walked deeper inside the library.

Who he saw was an angel, floating near the ceiling. Had seen her floating in the sky and followed her in here, and no one was even trying to catch her except him! But reaching the top floor, he couldn't find her so maybe, he figured, someone else—wait—that beautiful woman over there at that table, was she her? 

The young man approached her, but when she looked up at him from her book, he bent down to fiddle with his shoes, smacking them with his palms, which were sweating, and muttered: ""These things …! Ah they, they really""—he gulped, cleared his throat—""they …"" He groped for the right word, something that would get her, would capture her heart or something, quickly!—""*They miscarried!*""

The woman was taken aback. Miscarried? She blinked, not wanting to flip out, not here, no, not in the middle of the sidewalk, where people rushed about past them, but wow. Miscarried. So. She set her teeth: So he thought the two miscarriages were funny. Wow. So he'd do anything to get under her skin, or no. No he *had* already done everything, and now, watching him crouch there hunched over his shoe—miscarried!—she snapped shut the book in her hands, held it up and slammed it down against his head while wailing and *ugh!* This child! She was stuck with a *child!* Who she beat with this book over and over—*miscarried!*

When she stopped, the man got up and, his face flushed, his brows fluttering, he grabbed the umbrella, thrust its tip against her stomach. It opened and slammed against her face, throwing her backward into a crowd, where she got swept along in the rush. Stumbling, spinning, getting a view of moving legs of bobbing heads of hats, she grasped for the shoulders around her to keep from falling, but then found herself in the arms of an old man who was carrying her along, his face inches away from hers. He smiled. His teeth were stained. Brown. His breath stunk. 

""Oh!"" he said, his steps brisk as he carried her off the curb and across another street, and clapped a palm on his mouth, saying into it: ""Sorry! I had a whole lot of coffee today! Big day, so I had to get myself fired up you know? I'm taking an antidepressant—Wellbutrin? Have you heard of Wellbutrin? Well, it's an antidepressant *and* a stimulant, so, you take that and wash it down with coffee, and it gets you fired up, I suppose, but why oh come on …"" By now his palm was covered with spit so, turning a corner out of the crowd's path and heading into that forest there in front of him where they'd finally be alone, he wrapped the woman with his free arm and clapped his other palm on his mouth and continued: ""Sorry about that. *So*! why was I drinking a ton? Well, my son—but I don't want to spoil it for him! It's silly, I know, but I always worry that, by speaking something into the world, wrestling it out of my head and inserting it into reality, what I say will have a modifying effect on reality itself, even though I *know*, rationally, that it won't! Here we are.""

In a forest, he let her fall to the ground at a door—a shack door—and as she lay there he strode over her and opened the door to go inside, leaving her.

Lying flat out on the grass where she had no idea what was, what … what even was this? Why did she have to keep it going? *Did* she? But, God willing—what was she saying?—God willing, she would roll over on her side to face the shack, which she now glanced towards.

Framed by the open door, the man stood there with his back towards her, thrust a hand in his pocket, and pulled a phone out to make a call.

""David! Yeah. I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry, no. No I don't think I'm going to make it."" He looked back over his shoulder at her, then looked away. ""Yes. And this one might be my magnum opus. No! *No!* Do you really think—David, I want to see you get married—I was fucking mixin' pills all night tryin' to keep myself fired up! You think I was doing that for my health? *No!* There won't be anyone like her! *Yes*. Yes. Her. She's beautiful. An angel."" 

While he talked, she pushed herself up from the ground and looked around to find she was in a circle of grass surrounded by trees. No, it was closed off by them, because where was the path? She wondered if there even was one. But then how did they get here? Yeah. How? She couldn't remember. Couldn't even remember what happened today. God willing, though, she would remember, and who knew? Maybe the way out was somewhere in between one of these trees. Which she trudged along, looking for a path, looking for a reason to go on, hearing a voice, a voice?

She stood still. Yes, a voice, somewhere deep in the woods, or was it two now? Yes, two, it was two voices! 

She jumped up, shouted: ""Hey!"" and ran in their direction, slipping through the dark forest, scrambling through trees and bushes, yelling, ""Help!"" as she groped her way about and—""*Help!*""—stretched her arms out to strike against this tree and that tree so—*and this one!*—so they never snuck up on her, *ha ha*, though now she smacked up against one, staggered backwards, dizzy, one hand clapped on her forehead, but what was she doing! The voices! Where'd—why'd they stop! She straightened up, started to move, working her way left, or maybe (she hesitated, but no)—*no*, left was what she decided on, and that was that. And so she moved. That was that, that was it. One direction. She should get somewhere at some point, going in one direction, someplace, and she bumped against another tree, slipped, lurched forward, had the feeling she'd been slipping and falling now a lot more than she did before as she fell. On her back, she propped herself up on her elbow, which trembled, and reached up and grasped a bough to pull herself up to her feet and keep it going in the same direction, because what else? Lie down? And where else? She'd dug her own grave. She should've been listening. Now, just—just commit—commitment—yes—that was what she needed—commitment to a direction, which, staggering through the brambles that clawed into her legs, she wanted to break off now, like, right now! Now! She wheeled around, and—there was no turning back: what was back, where was that, oh, she was so stupid—and she scrambled through trees and counted to a hundred before stopping in her tracks, choosing another direction, and setting off again, murmuring one two three four five—and she found herself stumbling up and down the forest, zigzagging until she bowled into a tree and collapsed to the ground. It didn't—her nose burned, *ah*—but it did not matter: She'd get up, she would. And, pushing herself up from the ground, groaning, she did. And that was a hundred, wasn't it? So. Had to choose another direction now. But she slumped against a tree instead. How many one-hundreds had she counted by now? Her head resting on a bough, she tried to remember, but gave it up, there was no point. To any of this, any any of this. At this moment she caught a glimpse of a flash of light and she reached up grasped onto a branch to straighten herself upright and, steadying, she saw it again there: a light (sunlight) shining somewhere in the distance. She walked, passing between trees, hoping this was it and (*Holy God*) emerged out into the blinding sun—ah! Ha ha! She blinked, rubbed her fists against her eyes and looked around. 

An open field. She let out a breath, squinted against the sun, was about to let herself collapse, or—no, no—maybe take a leisurely walk and maybe try to use this energy to celebrate the freedom she regained somehow, when she noticed grass underfoot and oh: trees circled around the field as if … 

Yes, no path, no anything. This was a circle of grass. Where, at the center, there was a shack.

Inside: The old man, speaking into his phone. His back towards her. Laughing. Turning around to her with a smile. His face dropping. Then saying into his phone hold on, David, he'd call later, sorry, and then hanging up and turning to her again, blinking, and crossing over to say:

""What?"" and then: ""What the *Hell* happened?"" and he waved at her clothes, which (she saw, looking down) were torn, muddied, covered with blood. ""Where'd you—where—Jesus! Can you *stop* running away?"" 

He grabbed her hand and dragged her into the house and up the steps into the hallway leading to her room. Inside, guiding her to her bed, he said: 

""Just get some rest, all right? There we go. Lay down. Sleep. For an hour, at least. Please. Okay?"" 

But from her pillow, his wife just stared, her cheeks hollow, her face white, and, God, he wished to Hell she'd just die, for her own sake, and left the room, closing the door behind him and locking it this time, because she was just going to leave again if he left it unlocked. Which reminded him again of how she stood there there in the doorway, clothes covered with blood, pants torn, forehead bruised—and now where was she? In bed. This crazy woman should be in a damned hospital, but he couldn't do that to them—the psychiatrists would raise Hell. Doctor Bo knew what he was talking about. She couldn't, with how weak she was, harm herself grievously anyway, so she wasn't going to die, so—but damn. What the Hell happened there? 

No. Didn't concern him. Now that she was safe, he shouldn't care.

Making his way to the front room, breathing heavily, it came to him that, well, with her like this—his magnum opus, he used to call her, but now—what now? 

He sighed, dropped into a chair facing the window and let out a breath, a tired breath, maybe,—yes, it was that, wasn't it? The tired breath of an old man. Or, rather, the breath of a tired man. Or—He pushed the thought out of his mind before it spiralled out of control (he could go on like this for hours), and then forced himself to keep his mind on what had happened, on his wife's torn clothes, covered with blood and mud, and how was he going to explain that to her doctor?

Oh, fuck it! Fuck this, he jumped to his feet, made up his mind to take a walk. Didn't matter if his wife went crazy in her room because *he* was going to go crazy sitting here in *this* dark miserable damn room, sitting here doing nothing, unused, misused, dis—and enough, he told himself as he snatched his coat off the back of a chair and grabbed his hat off the coat rack and stormed out of the front door and down the sidewalk, *enough* with all these sentence analyses. Just needed to keep this going, no matter what. Couldn't stop, no, couldn't stop, couldn't stop.

Yes, analyses, the young man knew, frivolous analyses of the type that he was drowning himself in, they, they really …! They …! The young man groped for the right word as he peered from behind the library's potted plant at the woman sitting at that table there. He wondered if she knew what the right word was. If he wrote down the sentence he was working on on a piece of paper and gave it to her, would she be able to fill in the blank? 

ANALYSES, THEY REALLY …? 

But would that be plagiarism? Plagiary? Well, it didn't matter, anyway. He didn't want to look like a weirdo in front of her, so that idea wasn't feasible. Viable. Permissible.

While I have put my best to honest efforts for a friendly good date, it just didnt resonate as expected. The flowers I wished to carry and the cafe with good breeze I imagined to make a date with lovely conversation was just little away.

I felt bad at times and lately I started to give up. 

But, this GIF I found out in my twitter feed, the way flower blooms and each capture of the sequence just made me feel like a rewind. Like every frame, every capture just made me exactly like how I imagined to put my efforts back then. 

Its just, vivid and lively. Just didnt make me loose my hope.

Hey everyone, I've been working on a side project and wanted to get some honest feedback before I go deeper.

The problem I'm trying to solve:

Small businesses and marketing agencies spend hours every week creating Instagram content. They know they need to post consistently but either don't have the time, the design skills, or the budget to hire a social media manager. Most end up posting inconsistently or not at all.

What I'm building:
-----------------------------
An AI-powered tool  that automatically generates Instagram posts (image + caption) based on real-world triggers:

Weather triggers — It's raining? The tool generates a cozy ""monsoon special"" post for your cafe/business.

Heatwave? It pushes an iced drinks promo.

Trending topics — India vs Pakistan is trending? The tool detects it, checks if it's relevant to your business, and generates a post that ties the trend to what you sell.

Holidays & festivals — Diwali, Independence Day, Eid, Christmas — auto-generates festive posts with your branding.

Time-based — Monday morning coffee posts, weekend specials, payday promotions.

The key differentiator — image generation that actually looks like YOUR business:

This is the part I'm most excited about. When you sign up, you upload 5-10 photos of your business (interior, food, products, whatever). The AI studies your visual identity — your color palette, your furniture, your plating style, your lighting, everything.

Then when it generates marketing images, they look like they were taken at YOUR place, not some generic stock photo. I tested this with a French bakery and the AI-generated images matched their forest green walls, their specific pastries, their branded cups, even their neon sign. People couldn't tell it was AI-generated.

How it works:
----------------------
Business uploads photos during onboarding
Triggers fire automatically (weather changes, trend detected, holiday approaching)

AI generates a post (image + caption) tailored to the business

Business owner gets an email notification with a preview

Owner approves, edits, or rejects with one click
Approved posts go straight to Instagram

You choose how much control you want:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Manual mode (default) — Every post goes to your approval queue. Nothing gets posted without your explicit approval. You review, edit if needed, and hit approve
.
Auto-post mode (optional) — Trust the AI fully. Posts go live automatically when triggers fire. You can still review and delete after the fact. Best for agencies managing many accounts who don't want to approve every single post.


Initially I was thinking individual businesses, but I'm now leaning toward marketing agencies who manage 10-20+ Instagram accounts. One agency sale = 20 businesses on the platform, and they'd pay more because it saves them real employee hours.

What I want to know:
=================
If you run a business or manage social media accounts — would you actually use something like this?

What would make you NOT use it? What's the dealbreaker?

How much would you pay for this? I'm thinking ₹2,999/mo for 5 accounts, ₹7,999/mo for 20 accounts.

What features am I missing that would make this a must-have?

Is the trigger-based approach (AI decides when to post based on real-world events) actually useful, or would you prefer to just schedule posts manually?
I'm not trying to sell anything here — the product isn't launched yet. Just genuinely want to know if this solves a real problem or if I'm building something nobody needs.

Happy to answer any questions about the tech or the approach. Roast me if you think this is a bad idea — I'd rather know now than after building it for 6 months?",4,1771699322.0,TeluguJournals,2,1.0,False

My mother had been buried twenty minutes.

This woman had known my father for two weeks.

I stood there in the cold with dirt still on the shovel and thought, you're right. You can't. But you also can't replace basic human decency, and yet here we are.

My dad didn't warn me. That's the part that still sits in my chest like something broken. He just showed up with her, this woman I had never heard of, never seen a photo of, never been told existed. She was standing next to him in a black dress at my mother's funeral like she belonged there. Like she had earned a place in our grief.

My aunt grabbed my arm when she saw them walk in together. She didn't say anything. She just squeezed.

I walked over to my dad before the service started. I kept my voice low because my grandmother was ten feet away and she'd just lost her daughter.

""Who is this?"" I said.

He said, ""This is my girlfriend. I wanted you to meet her.""

I looked at him for a long moment. I genuinely did not have words. My mother had died four days ago. Four days. She was in a box. The flowers on top of it were still fresh.

""Not today,"" I said. ""Please. Not today.""

He put his hand on my shoulder and said she was there for support. His support. Like I was supposed to be grateful she'd carved out time in her two-week-old relationship to attend a stranger's funeral.

She introduced herself to my relatives. She made small talk at the reception. She ate from the food trays people had brought to honor my mother's memory. When my mother's closest friend started crying during a toast, this woman, my dad's girlfriend of fourteen days, put her hand on her back and rubbed it like she was part of the family.

I went into the bathroom and sat on the edge of the tub for about ten minutes.

My cousin came and found me. She didn't say anything either. She just sat next to me on the tub and we stared at the wall.

That was the day.

The months after were quieter but worse in a different way. My dad called regularly. He talked about her constantly. How she made him laugh. How she understood him. How she'd been such a comfort during a ""difficult season."" He used those exact words. Difficult season. Like my mother's death was a quarter of the year he had to get through.

I told him I needed time. He said he understood.

He did not understand.

Six months after my mother's funeral, he called to tell me he was getting married.

I was standing in my kitchen. I remember I was holding a coffee mug and I set it down very carefully because my hands had started shaking and I didn't want to drop it.

""Six months,"" I said.

""We love each other,"" he said.

""Six months,"" I said again.

He started explaining. Something about how at his age, when you know, you know. Something about my mother would have wanted him to be happy. I stopped listening around the part where he used her name to justify marrying a woman she never met.

I told him I wouldn't be at the wedding.

He said I was being dramatic.

I said, ""I'm being honest. There's a difference.""

He hung up.

His sister, my aunt, called me two days later to tell me I was hurting him. That he missed me. That family should show up. I asked her if she had stood at the graveside and watched a woman my dad had known for two weeks introduce herself to my grandmother over a casserole dish.

She went quiet.

""I was there,"" she finally said.

""Then you know,"" I said.

The wedding happened on a Saturday in April. I know because my cousin texted me a photo by accident, a group shot outside the venue, my dad in a suit, his new wife in ivory, people I'd known my whole life standing around them smiling. My cousin apologized immediately. I told her it was fine.

It wasn't fine, but I didn't want to make her feel worse.

My dad sent me a card afterward. Inside it said they hoped I could find peace and join them for dinner sometime so we could ""start fresh."" She had signed it too. Her name, and then underneath, ""wishing you healing.""

I put it in a drawer. Haven't opened the drawer since.

He calls sometimes. I answer maybe half the time. We talk about nothing. Sports. Weather. He doesn't mention her name and I don't ask.

My mother was kind. She was the kind of person who remembered everyone's birthday and kept notes about people's allergies before dinner parties. She spent thirty-one years building a life with my father. And then she died, and four days later he brought a stranger to her funeral, and six months after that he replaced her so completely he put someone else in a white dress and called it love.

I didn't make a scene. I didn't yell. I didn't cut him off entirely, even though a lot of people told me I had every right to.

I just didn't go to the wedding.

And he told people I abandoned him during a hard time.

So I'm asking, genuinely, because I've been sitting with this for a while now. Am I the one who got this wrong?

1raywcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilipinoNclex/comments/1raywcm/passed_heres_some_advice_and_a_super_long_post/,"PASSED! (here's some advice and a super long post, SORRY!)","

I took my exam 7/7/22 and I passed!

I just wanted to jump in and give some information and advice I think will be beneficial, **sorry in advance for the** ***super*** **long post**!

First, let's talk about what a CAT is and how the NCLEX works. The NCLEX is a computer adaptive test designed to assess your level of competency.

*Processing img h3nx05899ca91...*

Looking at the image above, lets understand why **EVERYONE thinks the NCLEX is hard** and how it works:

* The green section represents the questions that requires critical thinking skills
* The red section represents the questions that focus on recollection and memory
* The ""hardness"" of these questions is SUBJECTIVE
   * This means that some people might find questions at the top of the green section easy, but it also means that someone can find questions at the top of the red section hard
* The **""level of passing""** is determined by the NCSBN
   * This line indicates the **MINIMUM level of competency** **a person should have in order to practice as a safe nurse**
* So you're probably asking, ""Well what determines if I pass?""
   * ~~Well, when you start the NCLEX, the first 15 questions are used to determine what level of competency you should start at and are random.~~
   * **EDIT:** The above statement is false. The first 15 questions are random, but are given to students to help NCSBN test future NCLEX questions, they are not used in determining pass/fail. They are research questions.
      * From the 2022 NCLEX test plan: ""Of these items, 15 are pretest items that are not scored...If the pretest items meet the NCLEX statistical standards, they can be administered on future examinations as operational items. There are 15 pretest items on every NCLEX-RN. Pretest items appear identical to operational items, therefore it is recommended that candidates give their best effort for every item""
   * The information below still applies. 
* With each question you answer correct, your next question will be a higher level of difficulty for you. With each question you get wrong, the next question will be a bit easier for you.
   * So, remember, the type of questions you get are determined by YOUR competency level.
   * Your level of competency is **NOT STATIC**. You can move up or down in the level of difficulty and you have 75-145 questions to do so.
* To pass, the NCLEX has to find a **pattern in your answers**, a pattern that tells them with 95% confidence that they have determined where your level of competency is at.
   * This is usually done by looking for a stretch of questions that you get one right, one wrong, one right, one wrong, one right, one wrong, etc.
   * **This pattern represents a period of the exam that you have reached a level of difficulty that is fit for you.** Where you get the harder ones wrong and the easier one right (remember, ""harder"" and ""easier"" is based off of your skill level), it has determined where you own personal ""level of competency"" line is.
* To PASS, your level of competency has to be ABOVE the ""line of passing"", this indicates that you meet the minimum required level of competency.
* This is why **the number of questions you have does not indicate that you passed or failed**.
   * The computer might not be able to make a decision right away, so it'll keep giving you questions to see if it can find your pattern.
   * OR, the computer determines your pattern and cuts you off at 75 questions
      * This could mean your pattern is above OR below the ""level of passing"", which is why some people fail in 75 questions.
* **VERY IMPORTANT!** If you don't pass, please do not think that you are ""below"" the skill level of other people! There are NUMEROUS reasons as to why someone might not pass. Including additional life stressors, differences in education, different studying preferences, testing anxiety, reading difficulties, ADHD and other mental health issues.
   * Everyone is unique, and you simply cannot compare yourself to others in this manner!!

Hopefully that makes sense. There are other ways the computer scores someone (visit [this website](https://www.ncsbn.org/1216.htm) for more information) based off time and number of questions. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

**The bottom line??? Taking the NCLEX is a personal experience. Someone else's experience with passing or failing, SATA, number of questions, etc. does NOT mean you will have the same experience.**

My own personal advice:

* Do what works for you!!!! Only you know yourself the best!
   * You already passed nursing school! You know how you work! You know what you need to do in order to succeed! Have some confidence!
   * I know I work best after a productive morning of coffee and video games, so I specifically scheduled mine in the afternoon.
* Do not let the pressure of other people persuade your own decisions
   * I.e., I did not listen to Mark K or look at any study material centered around it. I know that I don't like listening to lectures and I also don't like using notes written by other people (I like to get my information directly from a reliable source or a textbook)
   * Just because it worked for someone else, doesn't mean it's going to work for you!
* It's okay to be nervous, anxious, and restless. I haven't been myself for 6 weeks leading up to this day. I was distance from my friends and family, I was irritable, I fell into bad habits again, I was constantly worried about my future, I even developed severe physical symptoms as a result of my anxiety!
   * It's okay to feel this way. You have to let yourself experience these feelings or they won't go away. I made sure to tell myself that I was anxious, that I was stressed out and I made sure that I was AWARE of my feelings.
   * I also found things that helped me cope or relax (like drawing or knitting). Things that you enjoy, take a break if you need one!
* I only used UWORLD to study. I did every question, and then went back and did every incorrect question again till they were all correct.
   * I made quizlets of every single medication I came across on UWORLD. I did NOT include the brand name because the NCLEX only uses generic names.
      * Funny enough, most of the medications I got on the NCLEX were medications I hadn't even heard of (but they did seem easy to figure what the best answer was)
   * I also made quizlets of information from UWORLD that I didn't know. I honestly didn't really look at this quizlet because just typing them out was enough for me to learn them. (So maybe just write/type them out on a document if that works for you?)
   * I did not like ""the method"" or ""ask graph"" or any of these other types of ways to help answer questions. Just didn't help me to use a tool to answer questions I was well prepared for. (I also thought that not every question can be used by these tools, I always came across a question I didn't know how to apply them to)
      * I liked to practice answering the questions on UWORLD rather than memorizing a tool to answer ""NCLEX style"" questions.
      * BUT!!!!! If it works for you, DO IT, DO IT, DO IT!!!!
      * (UWORLD has a great chart on how to answer priority questions, DM me if you want it)
   * I do recommend watching [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7Shzs9FqpQ&ab_channel=NCLEXCrusadeInternational). There are maybe 5 or 6 videos I watched, but he has some great ones that go over how to identify parts of the questions.
   * Doing the incorrect questions again worked for me. I was worried I'd end up just memorizing them (some of them I did, especially towards the end) but for the most part I didn't. Doing them again gave me the opportunity to fine tune my skills, to learn how to pick out important details in my own way, to reword them in my way.
   * I only had one self-assessment and I got ""very high"" chance of passing. Although I firmly believe that these scores are not indicative of truly passing. (You know you have a very high chance of passing because you are preparing AS YOU KNOW BEST!)
* I bought Archer the weekend before my test to do one of their self-assessments, basically, it was the worst $50 I ever spent. I do NOT recommend you buy it.
   * I knew it was bad when they had a questions that was actually WRONG!
      * A question they gave me had a statement in the rationale that I am 99% convinced is flat out WRONG
      * Not only was I not able to find reliable information about this statement, it honestly just confused me more than it helped! (I don't even care if I am wrong, it doesn't help anyone if it just confuses them)
   * The questions seemed way too easy and the format was no different than UWORLD
   * There were numerous typos/grammatical errors and questions that I seriously was like....""did I really spend money on this!?""
   * Some of the SATA had like 8 options which is not accurate to the NCLEX
* I do not know how many SATA I had. I heard some people say that they had a TON of them, I know I didn't. It felt pretty balanced between SATA and multiple choice.
* Wear something comfy!
* I left my phone in my car. I only took my car keys, a water bottle, and my ID.
* I hid the question tracker so I wouldn't know what question I was on.
* You can't cross out options or highlight like you can on UWORLD.
* I did have one questions where I had to click on the exhibit to look at information and then answer it.
* I took my first break 1 hour in, I was on question 45.
* My exam shut off at 75 questions
* Do **NOT** think about the difficulty of question or if it is above or below the ""level of passing"". FOCUS ON THE QUESTION and nothing else!
* I've seen a lot of people referring to the questions as ""vague"". I think the questions on UWORLD were more concept focused, like you needed to understand the entire disease process or medication to answer a specific question. But on the actual NCLEX, I found the questions to be more *broad*, incorporating a less understanding of the disease and more so recognizing priority in providing care. I'm sorry if that doesn't make sense.
   * UWORLD provided me with TONS of questions that felt VERY similar to what I saw on the NCLEX.
* In all honesty, I walked to my car and realized just how small 75 questions are compared to the SIX WEEKS I took to prepare, the NCLEX seems like this horrible, scary, huge exam. It's really just 75-145 questions of content you have prepared for, YOU GOT THIS!
* Yes I used the ""good pop up"" trick immediately after I got the email saying I completed my exam (just used the wrong CVC code to avoid being charged). I also checked my NRB every hour and still nothing.
   * It's currently Saturday and it took **exactly** (and I mean EXACTLY, to the minute) 48 hours since my exam turned off to give me my quick results
   * I was dying in those 48 hours!
* I took off the 2 days before my exam. I refused to study or do any questions. I may have reviewed some medications I wasn't sure on, but the day before I didn't do anything but relax (in reality, I cleaned my entire apartment head-to-toe to distract myself lol)
* I did not tell ANYONE I was taking it. Not a soul. Anyone that asked if I scheduled it were not nursing-related and didn't understand how it worked, so I just told them no. And I just lied to other people who asked. I tend to do things privately and to completion before I tell anyone, just takes some pressure off of me.
* **Okay, most importantly!!!** You. Will. Pass.
   * Tell yourself that EVERY SINGLE DAY. You have to be confident! It sounds so cliche, but cliches are cliche for a reason!
   * Be confident in yourself. Go in there READY to answer some questions.
   * I always spoke so highly to myself and I left the NCLEX feeling confident I passed, I tried not to let the "">!I'm going to fail!<"" words anywhere close to my vocabulary!

Please, if you read this whole thing, or maybe you didn't LOL, just be kind to yourself. *You are a soft soul and deserve to be treated with kindness*. Have faith in yourself!

**TL;DR:** An experience with the NCLEX is personal, and no one knows you more personally than you do yourself. Be confident, be proud, go in with the attitude that you already passed! Never tell yourself you are going to fail and NEVER compare yourself to other people. You're gonna rock this, Nurse!

I imagine them meeting for coffees during the workday to chat or catch up or whatever and it drives me nuts! I imagine that because I go so far to read his messages with her, and she asked him to meet up in a cute village nearby for coffee (to which my husband didn't reply!

I've put a lot of thought into this and the only thing I came up with is I'm afraid he's going to prefer her over me. Is this something wives usually encounter? I've spoken to my mom about it and she said at first she was annoyed with my dad's sister- maybe it's a family thing?

1. Bistro L'Hermitage (French): The most expensive on this list by far, but it's well worth it. The food is always incredible, the ambience and staff are immaculate, I'd live here if I could.
2. Secret Garden Cafe (American): Tasty food, have great specials sometimes, generally good service and the patio is really pretty in the summer.
3. Thai Ghang Waan Occoquan (Thai): Tasty food, I love their basil fried rice and green curry. Only place in the area that does croissant banana pudding. The cocktails are also really fun.
4. D'Rocco's (Italian): Some people might beef with putting this above Bottle Stop, but I just like the reliably good pasta and sea bass. Solid cocktails too.
5. Bottle Stop Wine Bar (American): Great lamb ragu and mac and cheese, good wine selection.
6. Cock & Bowl (Belgian): Mussels are solid, sandwiches are meh, waffles are insane. The onion soup is also crazy, honestly might be even better than Bistro L'Hermitage's.
7. Bar J Chili Parlor (Tex Mex): The chili is top-tier. Really, really enjoyable, especially for the price. Cocktails aren't great, though.
8. Zorba's Grill (Greek): Nice Greek food, haven't been in a while but I've enjoyed it. I love that I can get baklava in town. The adjoining ice cream place also has an incredible lavender flavor.
9. Ballywhack Shack (American): Good coffee/sandwich place. The hot dogs are a fun novelty. Not much more to say.
10. Grind N Crepe (American): Nice breakfast spot, not insane but solid crepes and coffees for the price.
11. Madigan's Waterfront (American): They make decent quesadillas, a good tuna poke bowl, and the ambience is nice in the deck during the warm months. I hear the crab cakes are good, but I don't like crab cakes. All the other entrees suck and the drinks aren't great. It's disappointing because the place has so much potential.

Honorable Mentions:

* The Golden Plum: Not really a ""restaurant"" but the pies and cookies here are TO DIE FOR. The King Cake was delicious this past week.
* Riverside Pizza Factory (new place apparently) and Graffiti Cat Pizza: I haven't tried these yet but hear good things!
* Yegna (Ethiopian): Just outside of the village, but should get way more business than it does! They just opened a couple months ago. Really, really good Ethiopian food.
* Potomac Pointe Vineyard: This is further afield, but the Sunday brunch is SO good and the wines are tasty. The scenery is really nice and the building itself is gorgeous.",50,1771698972.0,nova,28,0.98,False

I'm mostly a filter drinker but I have a Bambino Plus, which I want to use for espresso milk drinks.

I'm looking for one cheap blend with caffeine and one decaf. I will dial it in and just follow that process everytime to keep espresso as simple as possible.

I have this set of portafilter, dosing funnel and puck screen.

https://amzn.eu/d/071rT6kN

The tamper I'm using is just the one that came with the machine (refurbished).

I WDT, try to level it on the countertop before tamping. It seems to come out slanted most of the time (maybe my countertop is slightly bent) and I think it's slightly too small for the portafilter.

- Any recommendations for my needs, simple/ effective. Based on my very limited knowledge this seems like a good deal?

Secondary questions:

- If you have any UK recommendation for good affordable beans (classic espresso, medium/dark roast profile) with caffeine and decaf? I want to find something I like, buy 1kg, portion it, freeze and keep going back to it 

- For decaf how should I change my process? I will dial it in anyway but just so I have a vague idea on what to try. I was thinking I'd probably need to go slightly finer compared to whatever grind I end up with for caffeinated coffee?

# Flush



""Not again with this goddamn rain.""

Wu Su muttered, watching the street drown outside. Two electric scooters and a handful of bicycles floated through the floodwater like rubber ducks in a bathtub. A toppled blue billboard blocked the road ahead. Car alarms wailed up and down the block, swallowed by the downpour.

This was his seventh year in the city. The seventh day of consecutive overtime this month. The seventh straight day of rain. The city had never seen anything like it. Not in all the years Wu Su had lived here.

He checked the clock on his laptop: quarter to one in the morning. He had finished half an hour early. He rewarded himself with two soft clicks of his tongue, snapped the laptop shut, and headed out.



Lan had been about to call it a night when the order came in.

Not because she was tired. Because the rain had killed business. Three hours in the airport queue, and all she had to show for it was a five-kilometer fare and a one-star review. The passenger had complained she'd muttered about the short distance. She hadn't — not out loud — but it didn't matter. The review stood.

*That's enough for one day.*

She was reaching to switch off her notifications when she saw the pickup address. Next intersection. And the destination was on her way home.

""Fine,"" she said to no one. ""Fine.""

She checked the time. Quarter to one. The passenger had booked for one o'clock. She had a few minutes.

She turned on the radio.

""…the suspect in the Lucheng dismemberment case remains at large. Police have sealed all major transit routes and are conducting vehicle-by-vehicle checks. Authorities believe the suspect is still within city limits. Sources close to the investigation confirm that multiple homicides have occurred in recent days, all late at night. Burn marks consistent with a cigarette lighter have been found on the remains of two female and three male victims. The ongoing heavy rainfall has complicated evidence collection, but police are confident…""

*Using one of those on a person must hurt like hell*, Lan thought.

Her gaze drifted to her own cigarette lighter. A Paul Frank logo — a grinning monkey face — stared back at her. She found herself wondering whether the killer's lighter had a logo too, and whether it showed up on the bodies.

The thought almost made her laugh.

Whatever was happening out there felt very far away.



The cab was a pale blue Hyundai Elantra, hazard lights blinking in and out of the rain. Wu Su tried the front door. Locked. He knocked on the window. Nothing. He couldn't see inside. The rain was too heavy. He moved to the back.

The rear door opened without a problem.

He folded himself in, shook the rain off his bag, and pulled the door shut. The roar of the storm vanished. Inside, it was very quiet.

""This a rideshare or what?"" he asked, still brushing water off his jacket.

He looked up.

The driver didn't answer. He only turned his head slightly — a reflex, not a greeting. The light inside the car was dim. Wu Su couldn't make out much. Only that the driver's right cheek looked wrong — sunken, as if something beneath the skin had collapsed inward. The yellow glow from the windshield caught the hollow and held it there, turning it faintly gold.

Wu Su gave the address and leaned back. He was asleep before they reached the highway.

A moment later, the soft, steady sound of Wu Su's breathing filled the car.

The driver slowly lifted his hand from the gearshift and brushed his fingers over the small blue light.

After a dozen seconds, he pressed it.

The surface glowed red — the icon of a lit cigarette — flickering with the vibration of the moving car, almost alive.



In Lan's experience, passengers came in a few types: the silent ones, the loud ones, the ones who made small talk, and the ones who flirted. She could handle flirting. What she couldn't stand were the loud ones — the ones who never stopped talking.

The woman in the passenger seat was, apparently, the loudest person alive.

She had started the moment she got in. Car model, Lan's age, the color of the headrests, celebrity gossip, trending news. At one point Lan genuinely considered pulling over and asking her to leave. The only thing stopping her was the thought of another complaint dropping her rating.

""You know that case?"" the woman said, still rummaging through her bag. ""The dismemberment thing. I've been following it obsessively.""

""I heard something on the radio,"" Lan said. ""They said they're close to catching someone.""

""Close."" The woman snorted. ""That's a smokescreen. My friend works in the department — forensics — and he says they have nothing. No name, no description, no motive. Seventy-two hours straight without sleep, all of them. And he's just a lab tech. You can imagine the rest."" She paused. ""Five confirmed dead. And that's just what they know about.""

Lan opened her mouth to respond —

The woman shrieked.

Lan hit the brakes.

""What —""

""I thought I lost it!"" The woman held something up, staring at it with wild relief. ""I thought it was gone!""

Lan looked.

A handful of Polaroid photographs.

""What are those?""

""These,"" the woman said, lowering her voice, ""took me a week of begging to get. My friend. The forensics one.""



Wu Su was woken by a vibration.

A moment before, he had been somewhere warm. A gold beach. Blinding sun. Tourists chasing each other through the shallows. And her — sitting at the water's edge, watching the horizon with that expression she had, the one that was almost sadness but not quite. He had wanted to hold her from behind. He was afraid of startling her.

The sea had been very blue.

Then the blue condensed — a single point of light — and the gold swallowed it. Where it had been there was only a hole.

She turned.

Her face had the same hole in it.

Dark. Bottomless. Pulling everything in.

He tried to shout. A train roared between them. The louder he shouted, the louder the train. And then she was gone, and there was only the dark, and somewhere far away, one small point of blue light.

The vibration dragged him back.

He rubbed his eyes. Felt around in the dark. Found a phone wedged in the crease of the seatbelt buckle, buzzing against the leather. He glanced at the driver. The driver was watching the road.

*Not his*, Wu Su thought. *Someone left it.*

He picked it up. By the time he got it to his ear, the call had ended. The screen showed a missed call. He couldn't call back — there was a passcode. The contact name read: GossipPig.

""Your loss,"" Wu Su murmured, and slipped the phone into his bag.

He pressed his face to the window. Rain. Road. The smeared orange glow of streetlights. His watch read quarter to two. Maybe fifteen minutes.

He felt in his pocket.

One cigarette left.

He smiled at his luck.

""Mind if I smoke?"" he asked.

The driver said nothing for ten seconds. Then he tilted his head in something that might have been a nod, reached into the storage compartment, and set a small ashtray on the armrest between them.

Wu Su patted down his jacket. His bag.

Nothing.

""Damn.""

He'd left the lighter on the coffee table downstairs. He was angrier than the situation warranted — it had cost four times the normal price, because the girl at the kiosk had been beautiful and he hadn't been able to bring himself to haggle.

""Do you have a light?"" he asked.

The driver shook his head.

""The cigarette lighter, then? Could I borrow it?""

The driver's body went very still.

Then he turned — more than halfway — and looked directly at Wu Su.

A truck came from the other direction. High beams. In the sudden glare, Wu Su saw the driver's face properly for the first time.

The hollow in his right cheek was not a trick of the light. It was a burn scar — irregular and wide — covering most of the right side of his face. In the truck's headlights it caught the gold and held it, and the dark center of it seemed to reach across the seat toward Wu Su.

For the first time, Wu Su felt genuinely uneasy.

The driver held his gaze for a few seconds. Then he turned back to the road. His hand moved from the gearshift to the cigarette lighter.

He pressed it in.

Blue backlight.

Red logo.

A cigarette, glowing.

Wu Su watched it, waiting for it to pop back out.



""He's not picking up,"" the woman said, staring at her phone.

Lan glanced at the dashboard clock. Ten to two.

""Maybe it's just late,"" Lan said.

""It's not that. He's ignoring me. At this point everyone's on full alert, phones on at all times."" She dropped the phone into her lap. ""People are something else. When I was thinner, this man used to block my path every night just to keep me from going home. Now he won't even answer."" She said it without self-pity, simply stating a fact.

Lan almost said something kind, then thought better of it. Whatever existed between them ran deeper than comfort could reach — deep enough that he'd risked his job to photograph those images for her. And if those photographs ever got out, the damage wouldn't just be personal. Images like that, loose in the public, could set the investigation back weeks from panic alone.

""Whoever did this deserves to rot,"" Lan said.

""When I first got these photos, I couldn't eat for a week. Couldn't sleep either. You get this feeling like you were there."" The woman shifted in her seat. ""And that's what scares me most — that this person is out there right now, living a completely normal life. Same restaurants. Same shopping malls. Probably smiling at strangers.""

""You're overthinking it,"" Lan said, more for herself than anyone else. ""If there's a warrant out, they're not walking around in public. They're hiding somewhere, or they've already left the city.""

""Maybe. But I don't think this one is ordinary. And ordinary rules might not apply."" She paused. ""You know what they say — the most dangerous ones look just like everyone else.""

""That's something you read in a thriller.""

""Sure. But even thrillers don't usually come up with something like this.""

They drove in silence for a moment.

""It's those burn marks,"" Lan said. ""I can't get them out of my head.""

""Exactly."" The woman sat up straighter. ""See, that's what got me obsessed in the first place. At the beginning the police were treating each murder as a separate case. It wasn't until the third body that they noticed the same mark on all of them. That's when they started considering a link. By the fifth victim, it was official. Five murders, one killer. Or killers.""

""Wait — killers, plural? I thought it was one person.""

""Honestly, they don't even know that yet. They don't know gender, number, or motive. My friend says the crime scenes were immaculate. No prints, no fibers, no footprints. Nothing except those five identical marks. And the marks look deliberate. Like they were left on purpose.""

""The cigarette lighter.""

""The autopsy confirmed it. Different degrees of burning, but all consistent with a cigarette lighter. And all post-mortem. Which means it wasn't done in a struggle. It was done after. Intentionally.""

Lan glanced involuntarily at her Paul Frank lighter.

It didn't seem funny anymore.

""My friend says the situation inside the department is worse than what's been made public. No real leads means slow progress, but they're also terrified another body will turn up before they have anything. Everyone's working. Nothing's moving.""

""Sounds about right,"" Lan said. ""Fast at writing traffic tickets, though.""

""I went back and studied the marks. Talked it over with my friend. We found something — it might not be much, but it's something."" The woman pressed her lips together, hesitating.

Outside, the rain showed no sign of stopping. The wipers were already at full speed, barely keeping up. Lan had slowed to a crawl, which suited her fine.

""Pull over,"" the woman said. ""I want to show you something.""

Lan scanned the highway. Darkness, a few distant lights, nothing else. She eased onto the shoulder and hit the hazards.

""Here's where it gets interesting."" The woman pulled the photographs out again. ""Look at them one more time. Focus only on the burn marks.""

Lan looked.

The marks were circular — about two centimeters across — with a grid pressed into the center, the lines sunk deep into the flesh, leaving a raised ring around the edge.

""I don't see anything.""

""You need a comparison."" The woman opened her phone and enlarged two photos. Raw pork, stamped with a blue inspection mark. And beside the stamp, on each piece of meat, a burn mark. Same size. Same grid.

""You did that?""

""One each — me and him. Look at the difference. Specifically the outer ring.""

Lan looked back and forth between the photos.

At first glance the marks looked identical. But on closer inspection, the ring on the pork was lighter than the grid inside it. On the victims, the ring and the grid were the same depth. The same color.

""Every cigarette lighter has a recessed element,"" the woman said, holding up the Paul Frank lighter. ""See? The heating coil sits about a centimeter inside the rim. Which means when you press it against something, the outer ring always makes contact first and burns deeper. The ring should always be darker than the grid.""

She pushed the base with her thumb. The rim extended slightly outward, then retracted.

""So even if you press hard enough to get the full grid pattern, the ring will still be lighter than the grid inside. Because of that gap.""

Lan stared at the photographs again.

""But on the victims —""

""The ring and the grid are identical. Which means the killer's lighter has no recess. The element sits completely flush.""

Lan reached over and took the lighter. Examined the base. Pressed it.

It gave.

""Are all lighters like this?""

""Every single one I've checked. Dozens. Every brand."" The woman smiled, but there was no pleasure in it. ""So either it's a modified lighter. Or —""

""A broken one,"" Lan said.

""A broken one,"" the woman said.

They said it at the same time.

The car eased back onto the highway and dissolved into the rain.



Wu Su cracked the window. Cold rain spat against his cheek. He drew slowly on the cigarette, held it, then turned toward the narrow gap and exhaled. A few drops found him anyway.

He turned the lighter over in his fingers, half listening to the steady tick of the road beneath the tires. Out of habit, he pressed his thumb against the logo.

It didn't move.

He pressed harder.

Nothing.

*Broken?*

He flipped it over. The heating element sat perfectly flush with the base. No recess. No spring. Rigid, like something cast in one piece.

He was about to say something to the driver when he noticed the car was slowing.

Through the rain he could make out the vague shape of an exit ramp. The sign was unreadable. He opened his mouth to ask —

— but the car had already come to a full stop.

The driver was pulling an umbrella from beneath the passenger seat, opening the door, stepping out into the dark.

""Wait — is something wrong? We're not there yet —""

The door shut.

The storm swallowed everything.

Wu Su pressed his face to the glass. Through the downpour he could just make out the driver, umbrella raised, crouched at the rear of the car, examining something.

*Flat tire?*

He hadn't felt anything.

Two minutes passed.

Three.

Wu Su decided to get out. He reached for the door, then paused.

The hazard lights weren't on.

He climbed into the front seat and pressed the button.

The yellow lights began to blink — immediately swallowed by the rain, leaving only the pulse of light itself. From a distance they must have looked like a pair of animal eyes, slow and patient in the dark.

Wu Su stepped out.



Lan would have missed the exit entirely if not for the flashing lights.

She leaned forward, wiped the inside of the windshield with her palm, and squinted. Slowed. Switched to high beams.

A man was standing in the middle of the road.

Large. Legs planted wide. Umbrella tilted over one shoulder.

He had been facing away, but the high beams caught him and he turned —

— and Lan saw the right side of his face.

The hollow there.

The way the headlights filled it with gold while the center gave nothing back.

He was holding a wrench.

Lan didn't move.

She looked at the woman beside her.

The woman looked back.

Neither of them spoke.

Then the rear door of the car ahead swung open.



Four people.

Two cars.

Rain stitching everything together.

Wu Su stepped into the glare and immediately lost his vision. He raised a hand against the light. Through his fingers he could just make out the shape of a woman climbing out of the second car — tall, backlit, her long hair moving in the rain like something underwater.

*He knew her.*

The thought came before he could stop it. Certain and groundless at the same time.

*I've dreamed about her.*

More than once.

Between them, the driver with the wrench had already begun moving — not toward Wu Su, not toward the woman, but slowly toward the rear of the car, where he crouched beside the loose taillight.

Wu Su exhaled.

Lan exhaled.

They walked toward each other without deciding to.

The taillight housing had come loose.

That was all.

The three of them gathered at the rear of the car without speaking. Wu Su watched the driver's back. Lan studied the taillight.

""I saw your hazards,"" Lan said at last. ""I thought you might need help.""

""I only noticed the car had stopped,"" Wu Su said. He was trying not to look at her directly. ""I was half asleep.""

The driver said nothing. He kept working, oblivious to everything around him. Or pretending to be.



When Wu Su asked how long, the driver held up three fingers.

Wu Su checked his watch.

2:35.

Half an hour, or until three.

Either way, not soon.

He looked at Lan.

""Where are you headed?""

""Qingyuan Compound. It shouldn't be far.""

""Mishi Street? East intersection?""

""You know it?""

She thought for a moment — rain on all sides, nothing beyond the headlights but dark — then looked at him.

""I'm heading that way anyway. You can ride with me.""

Wu Su looked into her eyes and saw his own reflection there.

""I wouldn't want to impose,"" he said.

It was not what he meant at all.

He paid the driver — fifty flat for a 48.60 fare — and followed her back to the second car.

In the front seat sat a heavyset woman who studied Wu Su with the focused suspicion of someone running a rapid threat assessment. He offered an apologetic smile and folded himself into the back seat.

Lan adjusted the rearview mirror.

Wu Su was already looking at her when she looked back.

She cleared her throat softly.

""Seatbelt,"" she said. ""We're going.""

Wu Su turned and watched the pale blue Elantra through the rear window, its hazard lights blinking in the rain.

*Like the poster for* Cats\*, he thought. Dangerous and magnetic.\*

He turned back.

Found her eyes in the mirror again.

Neither of them looked away for a long moment.

""Wu Su,"" he said. ""Nice to meet you.""

""Lan,"" she said. ""Like in *bo-lan*. Ripple.""

A pause.

Those bright eyes shifted away first — just barely.

""Nice to meet you too.""



The driver stood slowly.

He pressed the trunk release.

The lid rose.

He stood there, staring into it for nearly a full minute before dropping the wrench inside.

Then he drew a long breath, spat onto the asphalt, and slammed the trunk shut with both hands.

The force knocked the taillight housing loose again.

He glanced at it.

Shook his head.

Walked back to the driver's seat.

The pale blue Elantra pulled back onto the road.

The taillight cover bounced with every dip in the asphalt.

Beside it, the trunk lid did the same — slightly ajar, held open by something caught in the seal.

A corner of fabric.

A uniform.

A police uniform.

On the back seat, where Wu Su had been sitting, his bag rested against the door.

Inside: the usual work things.

And one phone.

Its screen dark.

Waiting for GossipPig to call again.



The night deepened.

The kind of dark with no top and no bottom.

The driver switched on the radio, catching the top of the hour.

""…breaking news in the Lucheng dismemberment case. Police have now identified two suspects —""

He turned it off.

The rain kept falling.

#**Village Under Siege (36x29)**

We don’t know who they are, or why they come, but we’re under siege.

The houses closest to the barricade have been given up and cleared. A couple of the lads have made makeshift watchtowers from the old abandoned grain stores.

We don’t know why old Myers’ house was torched. They didn’t even let him get away.

If anyone knows of some adventurers for hire, we’re in desperate need. We can pay.

1rayois,https://i.redd.it/r5uk7l925wkg1.png,Why is every IOU app a subscription now? I made Tabsy so we can track what we lend or borrow in peace.,"Is it just me, or has Splitwise become actually unusable lately?

I’m a student, and I’m so tired of every basic utility trying to hit me with a monthly fee. I sat down to log a few grocery receipts with my roommates the other day and hit a ""daily limit."" Since when is counting money a premium feature?

I got fed up and spent my free time (when I should’ve been studying) building **Tabsy**.

**The ""Why"":** I realized I hate Venmo-ing people for every tiny $5 coffee or $12 gas fill-up. It clutters my feed and feels like I’m constantly barking at my friends for money. I wanted a way to just ""add it to the tab"" and settle up once a week or month without the app holding my data hostage or charging me to see it.

**How it’s different from the big guys:**

* **No ""Daily Limits"":** Add as many expenses as you want. I'm not going to charge you to use a calculator.
* **No Forced Accounts:** You can actually show a friend what they owe without forcing them to download the app and create a whole profile just to see a receipt.
* **Privacy First:** Unlike Splitwise (which has a habit of harvesting data), I built this with end-to-end encryption for cloud features. I don't want to sell your data; I just want to know who owes me for the pizza.
* **Actually Smooth:** No lag, no bloat, no spyware. Just a clean way to log stuff in seconds.

I’m just one person working on this, but I’m trying to keep it a ""for the students, by a student"" kind of project. It’s free for all the core stuff because, honestly, we’re all broke.

Would love for you guys to check it out and roast the UI or tell me what features it's missing. I’m just trying to make ""settling up"" less of a headache for all of us.

Back on January 30, Starbucks held an open house at their Ayala Center Cebu branch, looking for full-time baristas. But one detail in the posting really stood out and honestly, it made me do a double take: applicants were required to have a college degree. A degree… to make coffee.

Honestly, it felt kind of absurd. Being a barista has always been about learning to make great coffee, connecting with customers, and working well with your team. Sure, fresh graduates can bring energy, but requiring a bachelor’s degree seems completely unrelated to the skills the job actually needs.

It’s frustrating because this kind of rule shuts out a lot of people who could absolutely crush it as baristas. Think about the folks who have tons of hands on experience, love coffee, and genuinely enjoy serving people none of that comes with a diploma, yet it’s exactly what makes a great barista This also makes me reflect on a bigger issue: companies focusing more on credentials than on actual competence. Jobs that used to be about skill and dedication are now being “gatekept” by papers and degrees, leaving talented people stuck on the sidelines

I get it for technical or professional roles where specialized education matters. But for making lattes? Come on. Starbucks’ requirement in Cebu might unintentionally exclude hardworking people who would thrive in the role, turning what should be an open opportunity into a degree filter.

So yeah… should making coffee come with a degree? Personally, I don’t think it should. But in Cebu, at least for now, apparently it does.",11,1771698414.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False

I’ll be honest. I am lazy. But at the same time, I want to be productive! I want to effectively perform my duties at work, I want the house to be constantly clean, I want to learn Thai, I want to do sports and read books. And I want all of this to be unhurried, slow, comfortable, cozy, and productive. And without stretching the learning process over many years.

I think it is possible if I build a system for my day. Literally writing down hour by hour what I do and how I do it. This will release a mass of energy that I usually spend on unnecessary thought processes.

Here is how I see it:

Reading. I bought a small e-reader that fits in the palm of my hand. It doesn't distract with notifications and allows me to fully immerse myself in the process. I use a speed-reading technique: it’s a skill of relaxed but fast skimming through the text.

Work. To improve my qualities without spending much effort, I will introduce a simple rule. After work, I will answer two questions: what was done well and what can be improved. This will give me an understanding of where to grow without unnecessary soul-searching.

Sports. I choose the time when I am most full of strength. For me, it's the morning: after coffee with a light snack, but before the main breakfast. This way, sports are a pleasure, not a struggle.

Cleaning. I realized that you won't get far on discipline alone. Instead of forcing myself, I use an inner mindset. I’ve embraced the idea that cleaning actually gives me strength rather than taking it away. After all, we came into this world for valuable experience, and I want my experience of interacting with my home to be pleasant. And this is only possible when things are in their places and everything around is clean. This turns into a kind of game or fantasy, which helps much better than a strict ""must.""

I think such a system will not limit me, but on the contrary, it will give a sense of calm, control, and relaxation.

Have you found your ideal system that helps you be productive while remaining in a state of calm?

1rayecn,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1rayecn/how_to_quit_porn_the_brutally_honest_guide_that/,How to Quit Porn: The Brutally Honest Guide That Actually Works (Backed by Neuroscience),"Look, if you're reading this, you already know porn is messing with your life. Maybe your relationships are suffering. Maybe you can't focus. Maybe you're tired of feeling like shit every time you relapse. I've studied this topic extensively, reading research from neuroscientists, addiction experts, and diving deep into books, podcasts, and countless forums where people share their battles. This isn't some moralistic lecture. This is about understanding what porn does to your brain and how to rewire it.

Here's what most people don't get: porn addiction isn't about willpower. It's about your brain chemistry being hijacked. Your dopamine system is fried from years of supernormal stimuli. The good news? Your brain can heal. But you need the right tools and knowledge to make it happen.

**Step 1: Understand What Porn Actually Does to Your Brain**

Porn isn't just ""harmless fun."" Research from neuroscientists like Dr. Andrew Huberman and books like ""Your Brain on Porn"" by Gary Wilson break down exactly what's happening. Every time you watch porn, your brain floods with dopamine. Sounds good, right? Wrong.

The problem is overstimulation. You're getting more dopamine from porn than from actual sex, food, or any natural reward. Over time, your brain's dopamine receptors get desensitized. You need more extreme content to get the same hit. Meanwhile, real life starts feeling dull. Regular stuff, like hanging out with friends or working on goals, doesn't excite you anymore.

This is called the Coolidge Effect. Your brain craves novelty. With infinite tabs and videos, porn exploits this hard. You're not weak. Your brain is doing exactly what evolution programmed it to do, but in an environment it wasn't designed for.

""Your Brain on Porn"" by Gary Wilson is essential reading here. Wilson spent years researching porn's effects and this book breaks down the neuroscience in simple terms. It's not preachy. It's just facts about what's happening in your skull. After reading it, everything clicked for me. You'll understand why quitting feels so damn hard and why your brain fights you every step of the way. This book will make you question everything you thought you knew about porn being ""no big deal.""

**Step 2: Track Your Triggers Like a Detective**

You don't watch porn randomly. There are specific triggers. Maybe it's boredom. Maybe it's stress. Maybe it's loneliness or feeling like crap about yourself. You need to identify YOUR triggers.

Keep a journal for a week. Every time you get the urge, write down:

* What time is it?
* What were you doing before?
* How were you feeling emotionally?
* Where were you physically?

Patterns will emerge. For most people, it's boredom, stress, or being alone at night. Once you know your triggers, you can set up defenses before the urge even hits.

**Step 3: Replace the Habit, Don't Just Delete It**

Here's where most people screw up. They think quitting porn means just NOT watching porn. But your brain has a habit loop. Cue, Routine, Reward. Porn is the routine that gives you a dopamine reward. If you just remove porn without replacing it, you're left with a gaping hole.

You need a substitute behavior that's healthy but still rewarding. When the urge hits:

* Go for a run or do pushups until you're exhausted
* Cold shower (seriously, this kills the urge instantly)
* Call a friend
* Work on a creative project
* Read or listen to something engaging

The key is the replacement has to be immediately accessible and somewhat rewarding. Scrolling social media doesn't count because it's another dopamine trap.

Pro tip: Download the app Fortify. It's specifically designed for porn addiction recovery. It's got daily exercises, tracks your progress, and teaches you about the psychology behind addiction. The exercises help you understand your emotional patterns and give you real strategies to stay clean.

**Step 4: Make Relapse Physically Harder**

Willpower is a limited resource. Don't rely on it. Instead, change your environment to make porn harder to access.

* Install porn blockers on ALL devices (try Covenant Eyes or BlockerX). Yeah, you can bypass them, but adding friction helps.
* Move your phone out of your bedroom at night. Charge it in another room.
* If you relapse on your laptop, don't use it alone in your room. Work in public spaces like coffee shops.
* Delete social media apps that trigger you (Instagram, TikTok, etc.).

This isn't about being extreme. It's about reducing friction for good habits and increasing friction for bad ones.

**Step 5: The 90 Day Reboot Is Real**

There's this thing called the 90 day reboot that's talked about in recovery communities. The idea is that it takes roughly 90 days of complete abstinence for your brain's dopamine receptors to start healing. This isn't some made up number. Research on addiction recovery backs this up.

The first two weeks are hell. Your brain will throw tantrums. You'll have mood swings, brain fog, irritability. This is called withdrawal, and it's proof that porn was actually affecting your neurochemistry.

But around day 30, something shifts. Your mood stabilizes. Real life starts feeling interesting again. By day 90, many people report feeling like a completely different person. More energy. Better focus. Actual attraction to real people instead of pixels.

If you want to go deeper on building sustainable habits but find self-help books overwhelming, there's an app called BeFreed that's been genuinely helpful. It's a personalized learning platform built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts that turns insights from books like ""Atomic Habits,"" addiction research, and expert interviews into custom audio lessons.

You can set a specific goal like ""break porn addiction as someone who relapses under stress"" and it creates a structured learning plan with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly good, there's this deep, calming one that's perfect for evening sessions. Plus there's a virtual coach you can chat with when urges hit, which beats scrolling forums at 2am. The flashcard feature helps internalize strategies so they stick when you actually need them.

""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear is also insanely useful here. Clear breaks down how to build new habits and stick with them. The book teaches you about habit stacking, identity change, and the power of small wins. It's not specifically about porn, but the strategies apply perfectly. After reading it, you'll understand how to make the 90 day reboot actually stick instead of relapsing on day 5.

**Step 6: Face Your Shit (Therapy Might Save You)**

A lot of porn addiction is masking deeper issues. Anxiety. Depression. Trauma. Loneliness. Low self esteem. Porn is just the numbing agent. If you don't deal with the underlying pain, you'll keep relapsing.

Consider therapy. Specifically, look for therapists trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). These approaches help you identify thought patterns that lead to relapse and teach you healthier coping mechanisms.

If traditional therapy feels too intense or expensive, try Ash (an AI mental health app). It's not a replacement for real therapy, but it's solid for daily check-ins and working through urges in real time. The app helps you process emotions and gives you exercises to manage stress without turning to porn.

**Step 7: Build a Life Worth Being Present For**

Here's the harsh truth: if your life sucks, quitting porn is way harder. Why would you want to be present in a boring, unfulfilling life? You need to build a life that's more interesting than porn.

* Pick up hobbies that challenge you (martial arts, music, art, coding, whatever).
* Build real connections with people. Join communities, make friends, be vulnerable.
* Set goals that excite you. Career goals. Fitness goals. Creative goals.
* Get outside. Nature resets your brain in ways screens never can.

When your real life is genuinely engaging, porn loses its grip. You're not fighting an urge, you're just busy living.

**Step 8: Prepare for Relapse, Don't Let It Destroy You**

You're probably going to relapse. Maybe once, maybe multiple times. That's normal. The difference between people who quit for good and people who don't is how they handle relapse.

When you relapse, don't spiral into shame. Don't binge because ""you already messed up."" Instead:

* Acknowledge it happened without judgment.
* Figure out what triggered it.
* Adjust your strategy.
* Start again immediately.

""The Porn Trap"" by Wendy Maltz and Larry Maltz dives deep into the psychological side of porn addiction and recovery. It's especially good if you're dealing with shame or if porn is affecting your relationships. The book includes exercises for healing and rebuilding intimacy. It's compassionate without being soft. After reading it, I finally understood that relapse isn't failure, it's just data about what needs to change.

**Step 9: Find Accountability or You'll Fail Alone**

Trying to quit porn alone is like fighting a war by yourself. You need backup. Find an accountability partner, someone who's also trying to quit or at least understands the struggle.

Join communities like r/NoFap or r/pornfree on Reddit. Yeah, some posts are cringe, but there's real support there. Seeing other people share their struggles and wins reminds you that you're not alone.

Tell someone you trust about your goal. A close friend, a therapist, a partner (if appropriate). The act of making it known to someone else adds a layer of commitment.

**Step 10: Rewire Your Brain With Real Dopamine**

Your brain needs to relearn what real pleasure feels like. Engage in activities that release dopamine naturally:

* Exercise (especially high intensity stuff)
* Socializing in person
* Creating something (art, music, writing)
* Achieving small goals
* Intimacy with a real person (if you're in a relationship)

Over time, your brain will start valuing these real experiences over the fake high of porn. But this takes patience. Your dopamine system won't heal overnight.

Check out Dr. Andrew Huberman's podcast episodes on dopamine (Huberman Lab). He's a neuroscientist at Stanford and breaks down exactly how dopamine works and how to reset your reward system. His episodes on addiction and habit change are pure gold. Huberman doesn't mess around, he gives you the science and practical tools to actually change your brain.

Bottom line: Quitting porn isn't about being a saint. It's about reclaiming your brain, your energy, and your life. It's hard as hell, but it's possible. Thousands of people have done it, and you can too. Stop waiting for the perfect moment. Start now, mess up, learn, and keep going.

You know that feeling when you hear your voice on a recording and physically cringe? Yeah, that was me for years.

Here's what nobody tells you: your voice isn't fixed. It's malleable. I dove deep into research from speech pathologists, vocal coaches, and even some wild studies on testosterone and vocal resonance. Turns out, most of us are using maybe 30% of our actual vocal potential. We're walking around with Ferrari engines but driving like it's a Toyota Corolla.

The game changer? I stopped trying to ""deepen"" my voice artificially (that shit sounds fake) and started training the muscles and habits that naturally produce a richer sound. This isn't about faking it. It's about unlocking what's already there.

## The 9 Minute Morning Routine

**Diaphragmatic Breathing (2 mins)**

Most people breathe from their chest like they're constantly anxious. Shallow breathing = thin, weak voice. You need to breathe from your belly like a baby does naturally.

* Lie on your back, put a book on your stomach
* Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts, the book should rise
* Hold for 4, exhale for 6 counts
* Your chest barely moves, all the action is in your belly

Do this every morning. It retrains your default breathing pattern. Once this becomes automatic, your voice gains natural power without you even thinking about it. The science is solid here, deeper breathing = better vocal cord vibration = richer tone.

**Humming Exercises (3 mins)**

This is straight from ""The Art of Voice Acting"" by James Alburger. Guy's coached thousands of professionals and he swears by humming to find your natural resonance.

* Start humming at a comfortable pitch
* Slowly slide down to the lowest comfortable note
* Feel the vibration in your chest, not your throat
* Stay at that low pitch and hum different sounds: mmm, nnn, nggg
* This is your chest voice, this is where power lives

When you hum correctly, you should feel your chest vibrating like a speaker. That's resonance. That's what makes voices sound ""rich."" Do this for 3 minutes and your vocal cords wake up properly.

**Pitch Variation Practice (2 mins)**

Monotone voices are the fastest way to sound unconfident. You need range. I use an app called Vocular for this, it's weirdly addictive.

The app analyzes your voice in real time and shows you your pitch range and deepness score compared to other voices. It gamifies voice training basically. You can see when you're speaking from your chest vs your throat. When I started, my average pitch was 142Hz. Three months later? 118Hz. The difference is night and day.

* Read a paragraph out loud, varying your pitch naturally
* Record yourself, listen back
* Notice when your voice sounds strained vs relaxed
* The relaxed moments? That's your real voice

**Tongue Twisters for Articulation (2 mins)**

A deep voice that mumbles is useless. You need clarity. This part is weirdly fun once you get into it.

* ""Unique New York, Unique New York"" (10 times, getting faster)
* ""Red leather, yellow leather"" (same deal)
* ""The lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue"" (focus on crisp consonants)

Clear articulation makes your voice sound more authoritative even if it's not super deep. It's like the difference between a sharp photo and a blurry one, same subject, totally different impact.

## The Habits That Actually Matter

**Hydration isn't bullshit**

Your vocal cords are mucous membranes. When they're dry, they don't vibrate properly. I keep a water bottle on my desk and aim for half a gallon daily minimum. Also, cut back on coffee if you can. I know, I know, but caffeine dehydrates you and tightens your throat.

**Posture changes everything**

Slouching compresses your diaphragm and makes you sound weaker. I read ""The New Rules of Posture"" by Mary Bond and realized I'd been sabotaging my voice for years just by how I sat. Stand or sit up straight, shoulders back but relaxed, chin parallel to the ground. Instant voice improvement.

**Stop throat clearing**

This was a tough habit to break. Throat clearing damages your vocal cords over time. If you need to clear your throat, swallow instead or do a gentle hum. Check out the YouTube channel Institute for Vocal Advancement, they have a whole video on this that explains the anatomy.

**Morning voice is actually optimal**

Your voice is naturally deeper in the morning because your vocal cords are relaxed and slightly swollen from lying down. Try to notice how your voice feels then, that relaxed quality is what you want to maintain all day.

## The Resources That Actually Helped

""Set Your Voice Free"" by Roger Love is hands down the best book I found. Love has coached Brad Pitt, Jeff Bridges, basically everyone in Hollywood with a great voice. He breaks down the physiology of voice production in ways that actually make sense. The exercises are practical, not theatrical. After reading this, I understood why my voice sounded thin, I was literally using the wrong muscles.

If you want to go deeper into communication skills without spending hours reading dense books, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from resources like Roger Love's work, speech pathology research, and expert talks on vocal presence. You can set a goal like ""improve my vocal confidence and speaking presence"" and it generates personalized audio lessons and a structured learning plan based on your needs.

What makes it useful is you can customize the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and techniques. Plus you can adjust the voice and tone, some people use a calm, instructional style while others prefer something more energetic. It's built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content quality is solid and science-backed. Worth checking out if you're serious about leveling up communication skills beyond just vocal training.

""The Improve Your Voice"" podcast by Ita Olsen is solid for ongoing tips. She's a speech pathologist who works with people recovering from vocal injuries, so she really knows the anatomy. Episodes are short, like 10-15 mins, perfect for morning commutes.

For tracking progress, besides Vocular, I also used the app Voice Tools. It's free and gives you real time feedback on pitch, volume, and vocal fry (that crackling sound that makes you sound uncertain). Seeing the data helped me stay consistent because I could actually measure improvement.

## The Truth About Voice Training

Here's the thing everyone forgets: your voice is a muscle system. You wouldn't expect to get ripped doing one workout. This takes consistent daily practice, but 9 minutes is nothing. I do this routine while making coffee.

After three months of this, people started commenting. Colleagues said I sounded more confident in meetings. Friends asked if I was sick because my voice was ""different."" One person straight up asked if I'd been taking testosterone (I hadn't). The changes are subtle day to day but compound hard over time.

Your voice is how people perceive your confidence, authority, and presence. It's worth 9 minutes a day to optimize it. The research backs this up, vocal training improves how people rate your competence, attractiveness, and trustworthiness. Wild but true.

Start tomorrow morning. Do the breathing, the humming, the pitch work, the tongue twisters. Track it for 30 days and see what happens. Your voice is probably way better than you think, it just needs training

I might be moving to LA from Boston for a job opportunity, but I don’t know anything about any neighborhoods? I feel like I’ve been spoiled with the safety, walkability, and greenery in Boston so am hoping for some of that wherever I live in LA. I love trying new restaurants and coffee shops, so would also love to be near some of that too. 

I’ll be working in El Segundo so would prefer to have an easy-ish commute to that area. I’m in my 20’s but I’m open to being in a neighborhood that’s more “family” oriented if it means it’s safer (I’m willing to pay for safety).Thanks in advance for the recommendations!",6,1771697945.0,AskLosAngeles,16,0.75,False

“Can I ask why?” Eric said, trying to keep his tone neutral. Quin looked at them from across the table but stayed silent.

“I want to understand,” Sandra said quietly. “Charamkaran might be the one who pushed him, but Tsrancomta was the one who tried to convince me the hardest. I want to know why.”

“Do you think that’s a good idea?” Eric asked. He looked at Sandra closely. “It won’t change his situation.”

“I was the one they were after initially,” Sandra said. “I should at least know why.” She met Eric’s gaze, blinking slowly while her tail curled and uncurled nervously. Eric nodded.

“If you think it’s a good idea, then I won’t stop you,” Eric said. “But just be aware that you might not be satisfied, or even like what he says.”

“I know,” Sandra said, “but I still want to know.”

“Alright,” Eric said, nodding. “But after training and lunch. And check in with Shao to see if he needs your help with the engines.”

“Thanks, Dad,” Sandra said, giving Eric a hug and clearing her spot of dishes.

“You really think that’s a good idea?” Quin asked softly when Sandra walked away.

“No, I really don’t,” Eric sighed. “But she’s right, she, more than anyone here, has the right to ask. I’m not going to stop her, at least, not in this regard.”

“If you say so,” Quin said. “I get the feeling you asked her to wait till later in the hopes she’ll forget.”

“Are you sure you’re not psychic?” Eric asked dryly.

“I’m getting a psychology license, so next best thing,” Quin said with a small smile. Eric just shook his head.

…………………………………..

Tsrancomta looked up from his hands when the door to his cell opened. He blinked but didn’t react when he saw Tsandrasto walk in, Eric right behind her and giving him a slight glare.

“You sure?” Eric asked.

“It’s fine, Dad, I just want to talk to him is all,” Tsandrasto said. Eric glared at Tsrancomta again before stepping out, the door to the cell closing as Tsanrdasto sat down in the one chair in the room. “How are you feeling?”

“What do you want?” Tsrancomta asked, looking back down at his hands.

“To talk,” Tsandrasto said. “I want to understand.”

Tsrancomta gave a hollow laugh. “Understand what? That we screwed up? That we were wrong? Or that our futures are now ruined?”

“I want to understand why,” Tsandrasto said.

“Does it matter?” Tsrancomta asked.

“Probably not,” Tsandrasto admitted. “But I feel like since I was the supposed reason, I have a right to know. So, I want to know.”

“There’s nothing to know,” Tsrancomta said. “We were just idiots, nothing more.”

“Seemed like a lot more to it than that,” Tsandrasto said quietly. “Even when he pointed a laser at me, Charamkaran said it was for my sake.”

“Cha’am,” Tsrancomta said after a moment of silence. “His name is Cha’am now. Targondian tradition makes him lose his name if he gets cut out of the family, which the captain has done. And if I get cut as well, my name will be Tsr’ta.” Tsandrasto nodded, as if it was what she wanted to hear. Tsrancomta knew it wasn’t, and didn’t want to tell her, but the words were coming out on their own now. “We were jealous, though Cha’am more than me. Targondians are almost always treated with suspicion or taken advantage of in the galaxy. If they aren’t suspicious of us, then they’re trying to upcharge us, and if they aren’t trying to do that, then they’re trying to kidnap us to sell on the black market or steal our stuff.” Tsrancomta shook his head. “Then we saw you, living with these weird aliens. You seemed shy at first, which is normal, but you were also happy with them. These humans, no suspicion, no trying to get anything from us, offered to fix up our ship, and you seemed genuinely happy to be with them.”

The words wouldn’t stop. Tsrancomta didn’t know if he was justifying himself or asking for an apology. It didn’t matter though. “They weren’t Targondian, and yet they treated us with respect and without suspicion. You were being raised, happy and healthy, by people that were not Targondians, and even being trained in skills for future job prospects. And then we heard that you had legally become adopted by the Humans.” Tsrancomta shook his head again. “something inside Cha’am snapped. His entire view on species outside of Targondians was shattered, and he didn’t like it. And I went along with it, because initially I thought something was suspicious. But then you stopped us in the ship.” Tsrancomta looked at Tsandrasto, his eyes hollow and pained. “Not the Humans, not the weird canines you keep around. You. That’s when I realized that none of it was fake. These humans were authentically trying to help us. Authentically giving you a family where you had none. They have their secrets, who doesn’t, but they actually were trying to be helpful. And we screwed it up.” Tsrancomta went back to looking at his hands. “You were just the excuse. The truth is, we kept looking for something that wasn’t there. And couldn’t accept that someone actually wanted to help us without expecting something in return.”

“Is that all there really was to it?” Tsandrasto asked quietly. Tsrancomta didn’t say anything else, and Tsandrasto nodded slowly. “Something I’ve noticed while living with my new family. If you treat everyone with suspicion, you will be treated with suspicion in return.” Tsrancomta looked up, his hollow eyes showing a glimmer of hope as Tsandrasto stood. “Something to think about in the future. Not everyone is out to get you.” She knocked on the door, and it slid open, Eric still standing there.

“We were also trying to impress you,” Tsrancomta blurted out. Tsandrasto paused, and Eric glowered at him over her head. Tsrancomta looked away, his scales turning a slight orange. “We wanted to impress you, and maybe try to bring you along and become part of our family.”

Tsandrasto also turned a slight orange color but didn’t show anything on her face. “Next time you try to impress a girl, try an actual conversation,” Tsandrasto said, her voice a little tight. “You might have more luck.”

“I swear, Jessica is giving you too much of her personality,” Eric said. Tsrancomta didn’t hear Tsandrasto’s response as the door closed, leaving him to his thoughts.

………………………………………..

“So, did you get what you wanted?” Eric asked as they left the brig. Sandra thought for a moment.

“No,” Sandra said. “But I think I got what I needed.”

“That’s good then,” Eric said.

…………………………………………..

“Alright, release it,” Shao called up. He grunted as he received the entire weight of the melted slag of panel, Moratasarco and Sortanca on either side in exo-suits to help stabilize the heavy weight. They quickly walked over to an empty area they had cleared just for this and put the panel down, Shao panting a bit. “How’s it look up there?”

“Looks like we need to redo most of the wiring,” Karmparta said from near the top of the engine block. “They’re almost as melted as the panel was.” Shao groaned in frustration again.

“Kids really did a number on these engines,” he grumbled, pulling out his datapad. A pair of small drones came out and began to cut apart the destroyed panel in order to repurpose it back into raw materials. “And don’t you dare apologize again.” Shao said, pointing at Moratasarco as she opened her mouth. She shut her mouth. “We need to get this fixed, not trying to take blame that isn’t ours, so focus on repairs.”

“Yes, sir,” Moratsarco said.

Shao shook his head a bit when a message popped up on his datapad. “Really? Now? Come on, we still have a few more days of repairs to get finished up.”

“Is something wrong?” Moratsarco asked.

“Jessica wants to plan a bit of a surprise,” Shao said dryly. He turned his datapad slightly so that the obviously-not-curious Targondian engineer could read the message.

“Awe, that’s sweet,” Moratsarco said. “We can keep working on the engines while you go get that taken care of.”

“The hell you on about?” Shao said, looking at Moratsarco like she had sprouted a second head.

“Or we could wait till you get back,” Moratsarco said uncertainly. Karmparta and Sortanca loitered nearby, trying not to look like they were eavesdropping.

“A party for one of us is a party for the entire ship,” Shao said firmly. “You’re all coming along as well. If for no other reason than I need people I can talk to that actually understand engineering.”

“But we-”

“Are guests at worst,” Shao finished. He put a finger into her face. “I don’t like people. I have made that abundantly clear. But if I have to go to a party, so do you. Got it?”

“Ummmm,” Karmparsta started.

“What?” Shao snapped, glaring at the man.

“Can we add some Targondian traditions to this party?” Karmparsta asked. He had gotten used to Shao’s glares at this point, though it took a few days (and many reassurances from Eric and Jessica).

“I’m sure Jessica would be thrilled to have some help and feedback,” Shao said drily. He shook his head as the three Targondians lit up in excitement.

He was never going to understand the appeal most people had for big parties and gatherings.

……………………………………………………..

“Well, now that’s interesting,” Nightclaw said, looking over his datapad.

“What’s that?” Marakkompo asked. The Targondian had never had any formal medical training but had become the Targondian crew’s unofficial doctor because he had liked reading medical journals online. He had taken a leap of faith one morning after training and asked if Nightclaw could train him to be a proper doctor, which Nightclaw had agreed to quickly.

“Jessica wants to throw a party,” Nightclaw said, reading the message in the new group chat. Marakkompo shuddered a bit.

“That woman is terrifying,” he said, thinking about their combat training.

“That she is,” Nightclaw agreed easily, typing a response back, his feathers rustling a bit. “She’s asking for any and all help, and Shao said that the engineers with him have offered to add some Targondian tradition to the party.”

“Oh,” Marakkompo said, brightening up. “Are we going?”

“I don’t think we have much of a choice,” Nightclaw chuckled, setting his datapad down. “She gets rather pushy whenever there’s a party involved.”

……………………………….

“Did you want to join us?” Jeremiah asked Captain Charamparshta. The Targondian captain looked surprised at the invitation.

“Are you sure?” Captain Charamparshta asked.

“I think Jessica would be offended if I didn’t at least extend an invitation,” Jeremiah chuckled. “You don’t have to show up, but it would be nice. Apparently, some of your crew are already volunteering to add Targondian traditions to the party.”

“Well, I wouldn’t want to make her angry,” Captain Charamparshta said with a small smile.

……………………………..

“Nice and easy, you want to think of the ship as an extension of yourself,” Adam said, watching the two Targondian sisters practice flying the Stingers. Apparently, these two had been the ones in charge of flying their ship most of the time, so they had the experience, just needed to expand their horizons a bit.

“Yes, sir,” Kamaserto said, trying to be gentle with the turn her holo-course was taking her on.

“Got it,” Kamamorta said. She was the more aggressive of the two sisters, at least when it comes to flying. Both had good flight skills, but they also needed to think outside of the box a bit more, which is what Adam was hoping to teach them.

Adam looked down at his datapad as another notification dinged. “Looks like tonight is going to be an interesting night,” he said with a laugh. The cake that Quin was starting to decorate was massive, easily looking like something that he would expect to see at a villa party or a wedding.

“Dammit,” Kamamorta muttered as her screen flashed red, indicating that she had ‘died’.

“That’s what being impatient gets you,” Adam said. “Or too much caution, seeing as you ran out of time,” he added to Kamaserto as her screen flashed red as well.

“I don’t want to damage your ship,” Kamaserto protested as Kamamorta snorted.

“Don’t even worry about that,” Adam said waving a hand. “We have enough materials to make a few more if needed. Now, let’s run it one more time, and then we’ll head down to the chow hall.”

“Yes, sir,” both of the sisters said, and the holo-course started up again.  
…………………………………………………………..

“Jessica, I do know how to make and decorate a cake,” Quin said mildly as Jessica hovered nearby.

“I know,” Jessica said, physically trying to keep her hands to herself, “but I want this to be perfect. Eric is keeping Sandra distracted right now with prototype testing and practice, but that will only last for so long.”

“Jessica,” Quin said, giving her a look. “Relax. I can do the cake, Shao and his engineers are already working on the Targondian side of things, and we already know you can’t cook anything except pancakes. So get out of the kitchen, go help Nightclaw and Jeremiah with the decoration, and make sure our alcohol stock has something the Targondians can enjoy.”

“Oh, good idea,” Jessica brightened, and rushed out. Quin just shook her head as she picked up the frosting again.

“Can she really not cook?” Samancarta asked as he pulled a pizza out of the oven. Both the Targondians and the humans were surprised and delighted to find out that pizza was a common food among both races, albeit with slightly different ingredients. (Pizza is universal and eternal. You can fight me if you want, but you know I’m right 😉)

“She can cook pancakes, which she most likely will for breakfast tomorrow,” Quin said. “But the last time we tried to let her cook something else, it was an unidentifiable mess.”

“By the Void, that is a terrifying thought,” Carmasorta said, looking up from the appetizer plate she was putting together. “She’s so confident that we though she could do anything. Also terrifying in training.”

“We all have our strengths and weaknesses,” Quin said. The husband-and-wife pair were sweet and had offered to take over kitchen duties when they had found out that the Reapers all took turns cooking, since they didn’t have a dedicated chef.

“I suppose so,” Carmasorta said thoughtfully. She smacked her husband’s hand away from the platter with her tail and gave him a glare.

…………………………………………

“Okay, what are you up to?” Sandra asked Eric in the gym.

“What do you mean?” Eric said. Sandra glared at him as he fought a smile.

“You have that face, Dad,” Sandra accused, folding her arms.

“Which face?”

“That face,” Sandra said, pointing at Eric. “That face that says you’re waiting for someone to fall into your prank.”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Eric maintained, looking away, the smile slowly winning the fight on his face. He checked his datapad for the tenth time in as many minutes.

“Also, you keep checking for messages on your datapad,” Sandra pointed out, “which means either you have a camera on the prank, or other members of the crew are in on it.”

“Now you’re just talking crazy,” Eric said, the smile wining as he gave Sandra a big smile, saying that she was absolutely correct. “Come on, lets go get some dinner. I heard that Quin was whipping up something good with those Targondian cooks.”

“You’re a dick sometimes,” Sandra complained as they left the gym.

“Right now, I’m just being a jerk, not a dick,” Eric laughed. “There is a difference.”

“Fine, a jerk, whatever,” Sandra grumbled. Nightshade and Shadowstrike both yawned as Sandra went into her room to drop off a few things, and the Tree Shadows followed them to the dining room. Sandra got even more suspicious when Eric stepped behind her, waiting for her to open the door to the dining room.

“SURPRISE!” came the shout from many different voices. Sandra panicked briefly from the sudden amount of noise, leaping above the doorframe and hanging off the wall outside of the dining hall, Shadowstrike and Nightshade startled to either side of the doorframe. Eric was just laughing as Sandra poked her head from the top of the doorframe.

The dining room was decorated with ribbons of yellow and purple, a massive cake in the center of the room on a table, and a big banner saying HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TSANDRASTO EVERFLOW. There was already some sort of drum-based music coming from the speakers, all of the Targondians dressed in robes in varying shades of yellow and purple, Jessica and Adam both laughing as Sandra slowly dropped to the floor. The tables had all been moved to the walls, and each table seemed to have some sort of theme when it came to food, with one having seafood, another with snacks, and the third having a variety of different dishes that Sandra had never seen before, and Athena was at a table in the corner, apparently in charge of making sure there was good music.

“Happy birthday, kiddo,” Eric said warmly, following Sandra and the Tree Shadows into the dining room as she looked around in awe.

“But, I don’t know my birthday,” Sandra said slowly.

“I looked it up,” Jessica said, still chuckling as she gave Sandra a big hug and picked her up. “Shtaran and Athena were a huge help, they were able to find your files and birthday. When I found out it was today, I began putting this together.” Jessica gave Sandra a huge smile. “Both Targondians and Humans make a big deal of birthdays, so tonight is all about you.”

Captain Charamparshta walked up, a gentle smile on his face as he handed Sandra a cup, filled with some bright yellow drink. “Targondian tradition mandates that you start us off whenever you want. And since it’s your 16^(th) year, we make a special drink. Normally this is the year you begin training in earnest for what you want to do, but my understanding is you got a bit of an early start. So tonight, instead of the usual choices and speeches, we only ask that you enjoy yourself, and give us the start you so rightly deserve.”

Sandra looked at the Targondian captain, and the various other Targondians looking at her, Nightclaw with his feathers carefully strewn with yellow and purple ribbons, Jessica beaming at her, Adam holding up a glass of his own drink, and at Eric, who just looked happy. Happy for her. She looked down at the mug in her hand, and took a drink, not stopping until she had drained it all. It had a slightly banana and lemon flavor to it, but the sourness that came across her tongue made her flick her tongue out several times in delight as a warm and fuzzy feeling spread across her body.

“Then let’s start the party,” Sandra laughed, and there was a big cheer from the crowd.

……………………………………….

Tsrancomta looked up briefly as the door to his cell opened again. The human captain, Jeremiah, peered in for a moment before nodding and stepping to the side. Tsrancomta shrunk in on himself a bit when his father, Tsransarmo, stepped in, holding a plate of food. A plate of food that Tsrancomta recognized.

“I guess there’s a party going on,” he said glumly. On the plate were Targondian traditional foods, several types of fish, a slice of pizza, several somethings that looked similar to the prawn fish from the homeworld, and even a slice of what looked like cake, as well as the traditional slerkav drink for an important birthday.

“Tsandrasto turned 16 today,” Tsransarmo said quietly. “The humans wanted to throw a celebration for her today, and several of our crew members offered to add in Targondian traditions as well.” He placed the plate on the table next to Tsrancomta’s bed. “You’r still a member of our crew, and my son. Detained or not, you deserve at least some of the celebration.”

“Why?” Tsrancomta said miserably. “I put us in jeopardy.”

“I saw the recordings,” Tsransarmo said. “Am I proud of what you did? No. But I saw you try to talk Cha’am out of his foolhardy idea. Even if you followed him, you tried to be the voice of reason many times.”

“I just wanted to help our people,” Tsrancomta said, his tail wrapped around one of his ankles.

“I know,” Tsransorma said. “You just followed someone down the wrong path. Next time, instead of following them, you can make your own choices.” He placed a datapad next to the plate of food while standing up. “If nothing else, you can eat, and you can watch. And maybe, just maybe, you can learn.” He tapped on the cell door, which slid open. “You’re still my son, Tsrancomta. I’ll wait to give you a leg up when your punishment is done, even if I will not defend your actions.”

Tsrancomta looked at the datapad and the plate of food for several minutes after his father left. Slowly, he started eating the food and opened the datapad. The screen showed a camera view of Sandra laughing with the Humans, learning Targondian traditional dance, and opening presents, clearly enjoying herself while the Tree Shadows ran around the room, trying to steal or beg food from everybody they could. Tsrancomta gave a small sad smile. Targondians can’t cry like the rest of the galaxy with their underdeveloped tear ducts, but at that moment he truly felt like shedding tears. “I am so sorry,” he whispered, as though his voice could carry through the camera to her. “I’ll be better, I swear.”

He wanted to cry again, but this time in joy, when he took a bite of the cake. There is no way that any cake should be that good.

……………………………………………….

The party lasted hours. Many of the dishes she did not recognize were apparently Targondia traditional dishes for a birthday, and they were all delicious. Apparently, they were intentionally made to be a light meal so that people could eat more, since Targondians have a slow metabolism and small stomach. Sandra was especially happy to learn that she could finally have the (very diluted) ‘Adult Drinks’ that Eric had denied her in the past. Apparently, the Targondian drink that she had been given, slerkav, was mildly alcoholic. And while this wasn’t the same exact drink (it took months of prep work to have it properly), the humans apparently had enough spices and alcohol to create a very good substitute. And while the rest of the galaxy demanded that drinking be kept to adults, Targondians say otherwise, as long as there is proper supervision. Sandra was buzzing pleasantly by the end of the night, and then Eric gave her one more surprise.

He had turned the rec room into a massive, open-floored theatre. There were blankets and pillows everywhere, one of the walls already showing a playlist of movies that she could choose from, and on one side were several drink dispensers, which gave hot chocolate instead of the usual coffee. In keeping with both Human and Targondian traditions, the hot chocolate was also slightly alcoholic, though a bit more diluted in order to help people wind down.

Many of the Targondians made nests in groups to enjoy the movie and sip on hot chocolate. Sandra cuddled with Eric, Adam, Quinn, Jessica, and Nightshade and Shadowstrike, laughing as the movie of a child booby trapping his house in the most ridiculous ways against robbers played. Her eyes felt heavy, but she didn’t care, slowly drifting off to sleep as one of the intruders was electrocuted while trying to open a door.

The last time she had been this happy was when Eric had shown her the documents that made her adoption official. And much like then, Sandra was happy to sleep in his lap again. The safest place in the galaxy.

​I’ve recently fallen in love with Vietnamese coffee, but I want to move past just following random YouTube recipes. I’m looking to learn the soul of the process from someone who actually do it everyday or knows the traditional ways.

​I’m specifically interested in:

​The Phin Filter: How to get the grind size and ""bloom"" just right so it doesn't drip too fast or get stuck.

​Bean Selection: What should I look for in Robusta beans? Are there specific brands (like Trung Nguyen) or local roasters you swear by?

​The Variations: Beyond Cà Phê Sữa Đá, I’d love to learn the secrets to a perfect Egg Coffee (Cà Phê Trứng) or Salt Coffee (Cà Phê Muối).

​If anyone is down to chat, share some ""pro tips,"" or even hop on a quick video call to show me your technique, I’d be incredibly grateful. I’m a fast learner and a huge fan of the culture!

​Cảm ơn!",1,1771697794.0,VietNam,2,1.0,False
