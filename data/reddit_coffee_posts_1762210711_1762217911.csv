1ontoly,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1ontoly/room_17/,Room 17,"I HATE the patient in room 17.

I’ve been a nurse in a dementia care home for over six years. You’d think I’d seen it all. How wrong I was.

Hamish moved into room 17 after Davina passed away. Over six feet tall, thin, with large veiny hands and a deep, raspy voice. Now as frail as a stick. I imagined he must have been intimidating in his younger days.

The first night, I introduced myself. He sat in silence, staring at the end of the bed. Rude, I thought. I gave up, placed his dinner and a cup of coffee on his table, and turned to leave, then burning agony exploded across my back. Coffee.

“Don’t ever turn your back to me,” he rasped, smiling.

I didn’t report it. Dementia patients lash out sometimes.  
I knew now why all the other staff avoided his room.

The next morning, he sat in the same position, staring. I asked what he wanted for breakfast. Silence. I turned toward the door, then a heavy object slammed into my head. Blood filled my hand as I reached for the wound.

“DON’T turn your back to ME!”

I ran out, claiming later I’d hit my head on a window ledge.

The following night, I crept into his room. He was awake, bathed in moonlight. Staring at the same spot at the end of the bed. I turned to leave, and then felt a sudden jolt of pain unlike anything before. His breath was on my neck.

“I WARNED YOU TWICE,” he screeched as the knife sank into my back. I slumped to the floor before everything went black.

I woke up in hospital, surrounded by doctors and some of my colleagues. I told them everything, determined to protect them from Hamish.

Their faces went pale. My colleague Toby finally turned to me and spoke.  
“Room 17 has been empty since Davina died.”

I drew in a long, trembling breath, swallowing hard to steady myself.

Then I turned to the bed next to mine. Hamish was there, staring at the end of his bed. Expressionless.  
I froze. I didn’t dare turn my back. Not again.",1,1762217716.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

1ontmge,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ontmge,A very big thank you to u/evaan-verlaine for an awesome fall exchange!,"My post has been a little delayed since a stuffy nose kept me from doing my usual smell tests, but I do really like everything! They sent me some soaps from Paintbox Soapworks (including some adorable minis and a full size in Dance of the Hares) and a lotion in Jack-of-the-Woods, some stickers (including some Over the Garden Wall ones) and a beautiful Over the Garden Wall lantern pin, a roll-on of Sorce Ephemera, a mini of Briix Matchatopia, a gorgeous bookmark, Silk Naturals Amplifying Lip Glaze in Captivate (I've already recommended this on the sub to someone -- it's a beautiful bruise-y purple brown with just the right amount of sheerness, plus I genuinely think it's the perfect size for a lip product), a mushroom candle holder and some beeswax candles from their collection, a couple of perfumes from their stash (first impressions of the smelly things below), and some matcha kit kats and dark chocolate salted caramel goodies. Overall, a very lovely exchange -- thank you again, u/evaan-verlaine!

First impressions/mini reviews on the lotion and perfumes:

**Paintbox Soapworks Jack-of-the-Woods hand & body lotion**

*Gently glowing pumpkin smiles hiding in the woodland shadows with singed marshmallow, pine cones & birch bark, bright orange mushrooms, & a sniff of woodsmoke.*

I really like this! In the bottle, the pumpkin note reads as ""pumpkin flesh"" and is really strong and surprisingly realistic. The scent on my skin is nostalgic, but I can't place it for the life of me. It mostly smells like that pumpkin note with some funk from the mushroom. I don't really get any woodsmoke from it. It's really good paired with Sorce Ephemera, and I could see it being nice layered with something with strong smoke or coffee too. The scent lasted on my skin for a few hours. The formula is really light and absorbed extremely fast (great for me since I don't like feeling greasy from oils/lotions, but probably not a good choice for someone with really dry skin).

**Sorce Ephemera oil**

*Fresh carved pumpkin, brown sugar, notebook paper, black soil, acorns, vanilla absolute, cashmere, milky musk*

I've worn this multiple times (including on Halloween) and it's still super difficult for me to describe! It's sweet, but there's definitely *something* else going on. Call me crazy, but I could swear there's some kind of orange in here -- every once in a while, I'll catch a hint of orange/orange creamsicle while wearing this. I saw someone on here say that this smells like Victoria Secret Love Spell, and I definitely get whiffs of that. I think the middle of the wear is strongest on the notebook paper note, but there's something else there too (maybe the acorn?) The end smells like a fortune cookie! This is really good over Paintbox Soapworks' Jack-of-the-Woods lotion to help boost that pumpkin. I also think it would be amazing layered with something smokey.

**Briix Matchatopia EDP**

*Matcha powder, Mate Absolute, Vanilla Ice Cream, Tonka Bean, White Musk* 

The vanilla ice cream is definitely the strongest note here. Osmofolia's matcha smells aggressively like salt and anise to me and this has the barest hint of that same anise quality to it. There's also some powdery earthiness here that's reminiscent of the matcha in Sorce Match Made in Heaven. The longer I wear this, the more I like it. I fear I may want a bigger size of this in the future. It feels like a perfume that would get a lot of compliments haha

My partner walked up after I spritzed this and had one thing to say: birthday cake

**Sorce String of Lights in the Forest EDP**

*Vetiver, lavender, beeswax absolute, golden orbs of amber, vanilla milkshake, Ambroxan*

Lavender vanilla milkshake! The lavender is herbal and reminds me of what I remember Solstice Scents Estate Lavender smelling like. I actually completely forgot lavender was a note in this and said ""oh wow"" when I spritzed it. Sometimes Sorce scents just smell...like Sorce scents, but this one is very obviously lavender + vanilla milkshake to me.

**Nocturne Alchemy Tobacco Musk**

*Tobacco Leaf, Fresh Pipe Tobacco, Tobacco Absolute, Caramel accord, Bastet’s Amber Absolute and soft white floral blend of Tuberose, Mallow, Angelica, Musk Flower, and White Lily all blended beautifully into Bastet's Musk base*

This reminds me a lot of Stone & Wit Revival Shoppe, which I *love* the scent of, but haven't bought because I tend to stay away from fragranced hair products. This also has a clean, soapiness to it that's probably from the florals, since NAVA florals tend to do that on me. If this were a color, it would be a beautiful golden brown. I feel like this would be great layered with Sorce Ephemera too.

**Nocturne Alchemy Tabac Doux Musk**

*Sweet Pipe Tobacco Accord (different from our Tobacco Musk), Bastet’s Musk Absolute (a white floral blend of Tuberose, Mallow, Angelica, Musk Flower, and White Lily), Benzoin, Vanilla infused Honey, Anise Seeds, Tobacco Leaf, Cognac, Oak, Tonka Bean, and Cherrywood*

This is really pretty and totally different from Tobacco Musk! It's clean (somehow without being soapy), really floral at the beginning, and slightly fruity. If I didn't know any better, I'd say there was beeswax in there. I think that's coming from the honey note, which really reminds me of Death & Floral Golden Honey. This doesn't really feel like ""perfume"" to me -- it smells like someone who smells ~naturally good~, if that makes sense lol. Kinda like someone who just got out of the shower. It's really nice!",3,1762217554.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

1ontjwn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ontjwn,DIY Office Before/After: **any suggestions and additions are much appreciated**,"

This was a DIY closet office I had made for minimal foot print in my room so I can have a new lounging area and better work space for WFH. 

I did 2x4 kiln dried wood with 4 inch lag bolts into each stud for the butcher block and for the shelf I did 1/2 Shepard brackets directly into stud then patched. Both are stained and poly coated. I Drilled 12 inch holes to slip the brackets into the shelf so it has the floating look.

For cable management I hid everything on far right side and routed everything for easy access(this took the longest lol). I also had an electrician install a new outlet and fed it from an existing outlet.

I finally wrapped up everything with Flexispot c7 morpher chair which I have no words for. Extremely amazing sturdy and my back pain literally has disappeared. I was on an old chair for years which broke down on me so definitely worth the investment (extremely expensive) but worth it.

Just need final suggestions for the shelf or room, like coffee table, bookshelf, lamp and overall decor? Any questions at all, I’d be happy to answer. Thank you guys so much.",2,1762217359.0,homeoffice,0,1.0,False

It's my first time posting here but I had a question and thought maybe some other baristas could answer with their own perspectives instead of googling it and landing on a single answer.

I just got a new job at a chain coffee company in my town (it's not Starbucks if that's relevant at all) and I had my first day of training today. I did a few on boarding videos and quizzes to get me familiar with the drinks and the machines and I still have 4 more days of training this week and maybe a few next week for anything else not covered. I got to make a few drinks for people who ordered to learn the routine and get in the habit of learning the recipes and the machines.

I have a tendency to set myself to high expectations, especially when it comes to what's expected of me by other people, and it usually turns me into a bit of a perfectionist. It's been a day, but I feel a lot of pressure already, as if I'm expected to know everything really fast.

I had a retail job before this, and my job before was EXTREMELY different. It was very centered around focusing on one task at a time. Now my new job is very multitasking focused (as is the job of a barista). I wasn't able to memorize any of the drink recipes or how to use the machines in a day. Mental memorization is also a struggle for me since I'm a visual learner + a hands on learner + I have to repeat things over and over and over and over again before it ingrains itself into my brain. Training as a retail cashier was easy since you can always do pretend sales and such for training, but you can't just endlessly make coffee to train as a barista.

Plus, im training with several different people, and it's looking like they may want me to be somewhat independent by the end of the week. I feel the pressure and its stressing me out and making me second guess myself. My co workers have been nothing but supportive while I train, but I also don't want to come off as lazy or seem as if I'm not doing anything when in reality I'm still trying to figure things out.

So my question- how long would it usually take for someone without experience like me to get the hang of this barista thing? I don't want to fall behind or mess things up.",1,1762216962.0,barista,2,1.0,False

G-HSD/hEDS but other connective tissue issues that are undiagnosed. Other stuff too, but that's the most relevant for this. I have a pain specialist who is laser-focused on my neck and upper back, and will NOT entertain the fact that the rest of my body and it's issues exist. He's qualified to treat them, they're all just out of scope of the original referral, so, nope. 

So when my elbow flared up majorly 24/7, he didn't even look at it, but he referred me to a colleague in the same clinic. He sorta shrugged and suggested ice. Or maybe heat. Or rest. Or movement. 

Now I finally have an appointment with his colleague about my elbow! Oh, it's over the phone. But ... I guess that's okay, as my elbow flared up in May 2024, and it's November 2025. I've had  18 months of adapting my body movements around the pain, so I'm sure a phone appointment will be FINE. 

**OPINIONS time:** I know I can flare the pain up again to it's max (well, pretty sure I can) by going back to my old patterns of daily movement. *You know, risky things like ""lifting the coffee pot"" and ""carrying groceries in that hand without bending the elbow""* \- **would YOU flare up symptoms in advance of a specialist appointment (or potential scan/ x-ray/ CT etc) to make sure there were subjective, observable signs to show on the day?** What sort of cut offs do you have for yourself? Obviously safety is paramount!!! 

I'm just curious; I'm know that saying ""18 months of unbearable symptoms"" is clearly not going to fly over a phone call, and it's not accurate. But they're not unbearable because I adapted around them, as we do, not because my elbow is all healed.  ",1,1762216848.0,ehlersdanlos,0,1.0,False

We know relatively little about the past of Wojciech Stempniewicz, except that he was born in Poland, likely in 1954. During his time in Poland, he studied at and graduated from the University of Gdańsk. Wojciech moved to Germany in 1993 and soon acquired German citizenship, becoming a dual citizen of Germany and Poland.

[Wojciech Stempniewicz](https://preview.redd.it/9686nmjhs4zf1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c72765496022564a977e9a7f04d7ba14238dd45)

In Germany, he married a woman and had a family with her, but they soon divorced. Eventually, Wojciech began a relationship with another woman, a Russian immigrant, and soon they started dating, with Wojciech moving on from his divorce very quickly.

Upon his move to Germany, he decided to settle in the city of Hanover, where he ran a trucking and logistics firm specializing in transporting and storing goods from Eastern Europe. It also doubled as a temporary employment agency to help those looking for work get jobs as truck drivers. The company was mostly geared toward truck drivers who were immigrants from Eastern Europe, such as himself.

Wojciech’s business associates and his girlfriend described him as reliable. Wojciech was also active in local politics, having run as a candidate in Hanover for the Christian Democratic Union in the regional parliamentary elections of 2011. It was an election he did not win.

On November 4, 2013, a now 59-year-old Wojciech left his home after sending a message to his girlfriend letting her know that he had to attend an important business meeting in Berlin. He ended the message with “I’ll call you tomorrow. I love you.” He also called some of his associates to tell them the same thing.

Hours later, he called a colleague to explain that the man he was meeting with was running late. Afterward, he sent a text message to his girlfriend informing her that he would be staying in Berlin for an extra day, which was vague and unhelpful, as he never specified how long the business trip was supposed to be in the first place.

By November 11, those who knew Wojciech were quite alarmed. They hadn’t heard from him in over a week, and any attempts to contact him were met with failure. A business partner of Wojciech’s finally went to the police in Hanover to report him missing. The police took the case seriously from the get-go, but were met with little to work with; they couldn’t even ascertain when he was last seen alive before heading to Berlin.

Looking into his movements, the police discovered that he took a long-distance bus from Hanover’s central bus station at 6:50 a.m. He then sent his girlfriend a message stating he’d be staying in Berlin from Berlin’s Masurenallee bus station before deactivating his cellphone. He then purchased another ticket for a connecting bus to Dresden, where he arrived around 3:15 p.m., but the trail went cold afterward.

The police were at a dead end almost as soon as the investigation started. They finally got there when they examined Wojciech’s computer, which he had curiously left behind. What they found on it was not something they ever could have imagined.

For over a year, Wojciech had an account on a forum known as ""Zambian Meat,"" dedicated to those with cannibalistic fantasies. Wojciech had been speaking to the users of Zambian Meat under the username ""LongPigHeszla."" There was another user on the forum whom Wojciech spoke to more than anyone else, and he went by the username ""Caligula31."" This forum had an infamous reputation, owing to the fact that Armin Meiwes had discovered his victim, Bernd Brandes, on this same site.

The two started speaking to each other in early October and eventually moved off the forums and began emailing each other with the email titled ""Schlachtfest,"" the German word for a traditional country feast following the slaughter of a pig. In these emails, Wojciech and Caligula31 discussed their cannibalistic fantasies and made arrangements for an in-person meeting.

Wojciech's exact words were that he wished to be killed immediately upon meeting him, with such phrases as ""I want you to kill me and eat me up"" and ""From the first moment, I will be regarded as your food.""

Caligula31 wrote back that he'd ""process him into sausage."" These weren't just hypotheticals; the two had talked in-depth about this, such as Wojciech asking about the room and whether Caligula31's equipment, such as meat hooks, could support his weight. Wojciech also revealed in these emails that he believed in reincarnation, which was another reason why he was so willing to be killed. November 4 was chosen because Caligula31 assured him they wouldn't be disturbed, as nearby construction work would afford the two some privacy.

The police were taken aback when they read these messages, and Wojciech's girlfriend refused to believe they were even real and said that Wojciech had not expressed any such fantasies toward her; therefore, she denied that he had them. She brought up Wojciech's plans to marry her and start a family as evidence that he held no such fantasies. Wojciech's other close friends and relatives, such as his ex-wife, were less surprised.

A friend of Wojciech's said that he had had these fantasies for practically his entire life. Even when he was a child, he had recurring dreams of lying on a sacrificial altar and once expressed the desire to be cooked by his mother. This affected his personal life, as his first wife divorced him directly because of what she called his ""perverted inclinations.""

By now, the police had their answer to Wojciech's disappearance; he had finally realized his fantasies and met someone willing to cannibalize him. But, of course, consensual homicide was still homicide all the same, so the police needed to uncover Caligula31's real identity as soon as possible.

This task was surprisingly easy, all things considered. First of all, the police had access to Caligula31's email address since they still had Wojciech's computer in their possession, with all the emails on it since he hadn't deleted them before leaving. Second, this was not the extent of Caligula31's internet presence. 

That same username appeared on a gay dating website. While no trace of Caligula31's personal life could be gleaned from the Zambian Meat forums, his personal information was listed on the dating site, and he used the same email. Caligula31's civilian identity was a 58-year-old resident of Dresden named Detlev Guenzel.

[Detlev Guenzel](https://preview.redd.it/6mns0um3v4zf1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4070b32bf4b30711cf08deef16c61924c604481)

The police were rather taken aback when they learned exactly who Detlev was. He was a senior police detective and a forensic handwriting expert who had been a member of the State Criminal Police Office of Saxony for 33 years.

 When Detlev was born on December 31, 1955, his home in Thuringia was still under the administration of East Germany (GDR). He was the youngest of four siblings and the only boy among them. Detlev said that because of this very fact, he was “spoiled from all sides.”

After completing his education, Detlev briefly worked at an electroplating factory. He worked there for a few years, but in 1980, he left the job due to the health risks posed by the chemicals he was exposed to on a daily basis. After his resignation, Detlev moved on to a new job, and that same year, he joined the police force in Thuringia. His colleagues described him as competent in his duties, and his neighbours said he was reliable, friendly, generous, and polite. The worst people had to say about him was that he was “boring.”

In 1984, Detlev married a woman, and together they had two children. Much like her husband, Detlev’s wife also worked for the police, pursuing a career in the state criminal investigation office.

 While their marriage appeared harmonious on the outside, behind closed doors, it was far from the case. In fact, Detlev might not have even loved her and may have used the marriage as a cover for his life. Detlev was a homosexual man and admitted that he had several affairs with men during his time in the military.

In 1994, Detlev and his family moved to Saxony, where he transferred to the Saxon State Criminal Police. In 2002, after 18 years, Detlev and his wife finally divorced, but everyone on both sides of the family said the two were on “good terms.” After their divorce, Detlev, in his words, “came out” and was now open about his sexuality.

In May 2003, Detlev married a notary he had met in 2000. While Germany didn't legalize same-sex marriage until 2017, it did have ""life partnerships"" and civil unions. Their wedding was attended by 150 guests. After their marriage, the two purchased a former GDR vacation home in Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau in the Ore Mountains, a property Detlev knew of since he was a child. 

The couple then turned the home into a bed and breakfast that catered mostly to LGBTQ+ guests and advertised ""quiet tourism"".

[The bed and breakfest](https://preview.redd.it/j9x7lezcw4zf1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b5495af710ee7a1504164c0e333203b1db0a9f4)

The business, despite its low-profile nature, was decently successful, and the two were welcomed into the local community, often taking part in village events. When Detlev and his husband celebrated their 10th anniversary in the summer of 2013, most of the village joined them.

But much like Wojciech, Detlev was also living a double life that he tried to keep hidden from those he knew. So, who was Detlev behind closed doors? Around 2004, Detlev discovered that he had sadomasochistic tendencies and began exploring this aspect of his life on various forums on the early internet.

Detlev went so far as to convert the basement of their bed-and-breakfast into an ""S&M studio,"" equipped with cages, restraints, and other implements, all without his husband noticing.

[The basement](https://preview.redd.it/dgaaferow4zf1.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c0491759fce2bdb205efd6dda7c38bd16901034)

Once, Detlev mutilated his genitals and anonymously posted the pictures online. Detlev also contracted HIV/AIDS around the same time he discovered this aspect about himself.

Wojciech also wasn't Detlev's first. Detlev had a similar conversation under his username Caligula31. This user was a 30-year-old man who had similar fantasies about being killed. He even travelled to Dresden to meet with Detlev. He stayed at the bed and breakfast for four weeks, but eventually Detlev decided that he was ""too young to die"" and told him to go home.

Another man, a 48-year-old mechanical engineer, also arranged a meeting with Detlev with the express purpose of Detlev killing him. However, on both occasions, they failed to show up, and a furious Detlev cut all contact with him under the belief that he wasn't taking this seriously.

Detlev had also been speaking to two others about this: a 58-year-old freight forwarder and a 49-year-old security guard. Detlev offered to kill both of them, but no meeting was ever arranged since the two made it clear to him that they were only roleplaying.

On November 27, after a two-week investigation, Detlev's fellow officers approached him at his desk in the Saxon State Office of Criminal Investigation in Dresden, where he was placed under arrest by and in front of his colleagues. After his arrest, Detlev was brought to the interrogation room and questioned.

Despite hiding it from those in his personal life for a decade, Detlev didn't need much convincing to open up and told the police all about his sexual preferences and interest in sadomasochism. But when asked and shown a picture of Wojciech, he denied killing him or even knowing him.

Eventually, the police had Detlev look at Wojciech's picture a second time, and afterward, he fell silent for several minutes before confessing. He told the police that Wojciech begged to be killed, when Wojciech arrived in Dresden he even texted Detlev and said ""Hello, your roast is ready for pickup"". Detlev obliged Wojciech's request by slitting his throat with a knife and collecting the blood in an old paint bucket. However, he later recanted this confession and claimed it had been obtained under duress.

So his new story, just like with the first man he met online, the one he sent away, he had second thoughts upon actually meeting Wojciech. He couldn't bring himself to kill Wojciech and told him, ""If I come back in 20 minutes and you're still standing there, we'll call it off"". He then left the cellar and came back to see Wojciech dead on the floor, having slit his own throat. The police didn't believe this story to be true, but unfortunately, they had no way of proving what had happened in that cellar; they could only guess.

On November 4, Detlev picked Wojciech up at the bus station when he arrived in Dresden, and the two drove to the bed and breakfast in Hartmannsdorf-Reichenau and wasted no time making their way to the cellar. The cellar had been prepped for this very occasion, and Detlev even had a Video Camera set up to record what was to transpire, well, part of it anyway. Detlev had deleted the video, but forensic technicians were able to recover the video, which was 50 minutes long.

The video began with Wojciech already deceased, his body hanging from a pulley system, his mouth covered with tape, a noose around his ankles and his hands tied behind his back with cables. Based on this system, the police believed Wojciech had been asphyxiated by this machine, but that was not the most egregious of the video's contents.

Detlev was completely naked, covered in blood and clearly aroused in the recording as he began dismembering Wojciech's body with an axe, an axe he posed naked with to share the pictures on online forums. At one point in the video, Detlev stopped and muttered to himself, ""I never thought I would sink so low"". Eventually, the video came to an end, but Detlev continued long after what was depicted in the recording.

Detlev spent five hours over two nights dismembering the body using a kitchen knife and an electric reciprocating saw while listening to pop music in the background. After beheading Wojciech, he boiled his head in a large pot and then hid the pot so no one could find it. The head was still in the pot when they searched the property and discovered it.

Detlev then removed Wojciech's internal organs and cut his torso in half lengthwise. Detlev then placed the various body parts in buckets and containers, which he proceeded to bury across multiple sections of the property.

Although Detlev told the police where he had buried the body, his property was still massive. The police had to deploy dozens of officers and call in multiple cadaver dogs. 

[The police outside the bed and breakfast](https://preview.redd.it/1nqobj7fx4zf1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=6da3466934d95d95ff9091a2850717659357de75)

And even then, it took several days of excavating the land to find Wojciech. The only body parts the police failed to recover were his penis and testicles. Considering Wojciech's fantasies, the police believed Detlev might have consumed the missing parts, but he fiercely denied being a cannibal.

https://preview.redd.it/22ghkk8lx4zf1.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cbf823dcb53f06dee613988279edf52542ade57

[The excavation](https://preview.redd.it/dcw9jpymx4zf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1d90f73568bf765eecec97c65b8ce86439662be)

The body was pieced together and sent away for an autopsy, where the medical examiner confirmed the police's suspicions about the pulley system. Wojciech had been strangled. They also found no evidence of any part of his body having been cannibalized. However, the medical examiner made one more discovery during the autopsy: Wojciech had been suffering from cancer.

This surprised those who knew him. Wojciech never mentioned it, and he never sought treatment at any hospital. It is to this day unknown if Wojciech was even aware of his cancer, but if he was and kept it secret, it might explain why he decided to choose this moment to go through with his fantasies.

Detlev's trial began at the Dresden Regional Court on August 21, 2014. By this point, Detlev had already been divorced and had the bed and breakfast sold and renamed. Because the video only recorded a portion of the dismemberment, Detlev's attorneys were afforded a little bit of wiggle room to actually plead his case.

[Detlev being brought into the courtroom](https://preview.redd.it/xqywq3txx4zf1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f1ce2bf960a76299a838546544edcd3b3935b3a)

[Detlev during the trial](https://preview.redd.it/edtzrb8zx4zf1.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebc0660f809d9fbed3a53a2038d88071251f4e19)

They argued that Wojciech had killed himself via hanging with the pulley system while Detlev was upstairs drinking coffee. They argued this to be the case since the footage showed Wojciech's feet touching the ground, which would have allowed him to save himself from being strangled. Wojciech's fingerprints were also the only ones found on the remote control operating the device, meaning he was in control of it at some point. They argued that Detlev simply assisted Wojciech in his suicide and then dismembered the body afterward at his own request.

Detlev's excuse for why the camera didn't record Wojciech's actual death, which would've cleared everything up, was simply because he ""forgot to turn it on."" However, Wojciech likely died just before the recording since Detlev could be seen periodically checking for a heartbeat. When the footage was shown in court as part of the trial, Detlev broke down into tears and said, ""I don't claim I'm entirely innocent; it was the biggest mistake of my life. But I am not a murderer.""

Wanting to prove that Detlev had a history of this kind of behaviour, the prosecution called the first person Detlev met up with over the forums to the stand: the individual who had also sought him out with the desire to be killed. According to him, Detlev didn't turn him away upon seeing him; it actually went a little further than that.

He came to him volunteering to be a ""spit roast,"" and Detlev initially obliged. He marinated him with oil and herbs and even wrapped his body in foil. He gave every indication that he was going to follow through, only to suddenly decide that he was ""too young for the grill."" The defence, however, spun this testimony a different way and said that it demonstrated how Detlev didn't actually have it in him to be a murderer and that Wojciech very well could have killed himself before the camera started recording.

On March 31, 2015, the court delivered its verdict finding Detlev Guenzel guilty of the murder of Wojciech Stempniewicz. The court came to the conclusion that Wojciech did not commit suicide and that Detlev did indeed murder him out of a ""sexual desire"". Their reasoning was that the length of the rope and height of the ceiling made it impossible for Wojciech's feet to be in contact with the floor while he was being suspended. 

However, the court also acknowledged that by all accounts, Wojciech was consenting and spent a month speaking with Detlev and arranging a meeting with him just for the express purpose of being killed by him. Because of this fact, Detlev was treated fairly leniently and given a sentence of 8 years and six months imprisonment. 

Both sides were quick to appeal, with the prosecution wanting a harsher sentence and the defence wanting Detlev acquitted on the murder charges. On April 6, 2016, the Federal Court of Justice in Leipzig overturned the previous court's verdict on the grounds that they had dismissed the defence's suicide theory without considering it thoroughly enough, while at the same time sentencing Detlev too leniently if he truly was a killer. 

The retrial began on October 31, 2016, with the defence pushing the same theory, that Wojciech had killed himself and Detlev was only guilty of dismembering and burying his body post-mortem. On December 13, the court, after reevaluating all the evidence, convicted Detlev for a second time. 

And in response to the higher court determining they had sentenced him too lightly, they gave him a ""harsher"" sentence this time. 8 years and 7 months. They only added an extra month to his sentence. They once again justified this on the grounds of Wojciech's ""unconditional will"" to die. Some even likened this case to euthanasia.

Only an extra month almost felt like intentional mockery on the court's part, so the prosecution filed another appeal. This time, the trial was held by the Federal Court of Justice rather than just sending the case back for a second retrial. On February 20, 2018, they returned their own verdict and sentenced Detlev to sentenced to life imprisonment. They firmly stated their position that Wojciech's ""death wish"" was not a mitigating factor. 

Detlev remains in prison to this day. Many in Germany have compared this case to that of Armin Meiwes, and it's easy to understand why. The similarities to the two cases are so uncanny that some have labelled Wojciech's murder as Detlev ""replicating"" Armin's crime.

1ont9yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ont9yj/i_stopped_smoking_cannabis_and_tobacco_two_weeks/,"I stopped smoking cannabis and tobacco two weeks ago, but I realize I don't even have any reason to and I don't know what to do","I am 28 years old and I have smoked cannabis daily since I am 16 years old, between 4 and 10 joints everyday. I am maybe autistic, I started some tests (I smoked before the sessions) but gave up because I didn't get on with the therapist. I love cinema, learning things, reading philosophy and scientific works, discussing about topics, cooking and growing plants. I tried going to univerity after high school but being in an amphitheatre with 400 persons or more was unbearable for me, I tried studying from home but my lessons didn't correspond to those I was supposed to learn, I failed my tests despite working hard from home. I had close friends from 15 years old to 21 years old, I isolated myself from them unwillingly for a year when I encoutered my first and only girlfriend, it didn't work with her and sadly my relation with my friends was too broken when I went back to them, they didn't want to see me anymore and I don't blame them, I have been alone with my family and my cat since 2019.

Exactly two weeks ago I had a supposedly panic attack after smoking CBD and doing sport, I am used to do sport after smoking and drinking coffee but I never felt like this, I thought I was having a heart attack and called an ambulance, the doctor said that my variables were normal though slightly tense (I went to my doctor four weeks before this episode and had perfect tension values) since this day I progressively stopped smoking entirely because THC and nicotine seem to trigger this situation. I tried smoking one cigarette yesterday and thursday and both time didn't feel sick but felt disgusted about it.

Those last two weeks I found myself unable to do anything, I can't focus on reading and personal studies (biology and chesmitry), I used to read 100 to 150 pages of a book everyday, I don't take any pleasure from cooking and watching movies neither, I have lost my appetite as well and spent several days without eating at all nor feeling any hunger. I am sleeping around 11 hours every night, I used to sleep exactly 7 hours and 30 minutes.

I have thought about my situation almost constantly since this day, I consulted dozens of posts on reddit of people who are quitting tobacco and/or cannabis. At this point, even if I don't smoke anymore and haven't touched THC for two weeks, I simply can't find any reason to live like this. Most cardiovascular problems and lung problems start appearing after 60 years old, but what do I care about it? By this point my family will be dead and I will be completely alone, I will be free to leave this world without forsaking anybody in need of me. People also said to forsake my hobbies and find new ones, but I don't care about it at all, all I love in life is being stunned by the beauty of the arts I am sensible to and by the truth I manage to reach when I study and meditate, finding a moment of organic joy by consuming a delicious meal and sometimes sharing it with my family. You may think that this is pathetic and that this is only because I am a drug addict that I say all those things, but I am not like you, I can't do normal things like having a job or hanging out with people because even when I do my best they must find me hard to engage with and will rather not, even my family hated me for years and thought I didn't love them until they understood I was simply abnormal. The drug isn't draging me down, it's draging me up, it's what allow me to make up with my situation and enjoy my life, and if I must die from it before reaching the age of grandpas it simply doesn't matter, because by then even if I am perfectly healthy I will be alone and too weak, like old people naturally are, to enjoy the beauty of the world and the truth that I love to contemplate.",2,1762216616.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Food recommendations at the end!

Top 5 things I recommend:

1. NaPali Coast tour (we booked with Makana Charters) (Kauai)
2. Field trip with shelter dog from Kauai Humane Society (Kauai)
3. Toa Luau (Oahu) 
4. Stargazing on the North Shore of Oahu
5. Waimea Canyon (even just driving through) (Kauai)



Day 1: Arrived early afternoon in Honolulu. Evening spent along Waikiki Beach and in downtown Honolulu.



Day 2: Malasadas at Leonard’s bright and early (stupid jet lag). Hiking at Diamond Head Crater with 6 am admission time. Very busy but beautiful area and views. USS Arizona Memorial in the afternoon. Minimal wait time for the boat to the memorial. FYI absolutely no bags are allowed on the grounds. Bag lockers are available for renting. Evening spent at various places in Haleiwa. Stargazing at Mokulēʻia  Beach Park. Would highly recommend if the weather conditions and moon cycle are good for stargazing.



Day 3: Beach morning at Fort Derussy Beach. On the way up to the North Shore we stopped at Green World Coffee Farm and Dole Plantation. We attended the Toa Luau at Waimea Valley. Welcoming atmosphere, delicious food, and great show about the different Polynesian islands. I would highly recommend attending this luau.



Day 4: Travel day to Lihue, Kauai. Leave for the airport earlier than you expect due to crazy traffic at the airport, especially if returning a rental car. Our first evening spent on Kauai was for laundry 🙂



Day 5: This day was our “Do whatever we feel like” day. We meandered along the highway up the East side ending on the North shore. The drive was beautiful with the lush mountains on one side and the Pacific on the other. We visited Hanalei Pier and Tunnels Beach. Hanalei Beach and Pier were busy but had great views of the mountains. Tunnels Beach had limited parking but was very beautiful. The surf was very strong due to winter swells coming in so very few people went in the water. We did watch someone surf for a bit.



Day 6: Charter boat tour of NaPali Coast. This was our most expensive experience but well worth it. We used Makana Charters. We even saw a large group of dolphins on our way up to the coast! On our way back to lodgings we stopped at Poipu Beach to watch the sea turtles come up. Poipu Beach was very busy but seeing the sea turtles was very cool.



Day 7: We had a field trip with a shelter dog from Kauai Humane Society. Our pup friend for the day was 2 year old Choochoo. The  humane society provides a backpack with everything your furry friend might need for the day and list of recommended places. It was a bit hard to find places to take Choochoo as most beaches were not permitted. This experience was very rewarding and heartwarming. As a cat owner it was fun to spend the day with a dog! 



Day 8: We spent the morning and early afternoon exploring Waimea Canyon. The canyon is stunning and there are many viewpoints along the main road. We hiked the Canyon Trail into the canyon. The trail was marked as moderate in difficulty but some areas were very slippery due to wet/muddy terrain. Definitely be prepared to get dirty! Just like most of the drives on Kauai, the one to and from the canyon provided beautiful mountain and ocean views.



Day 9: Lazy day at our lodgings 🙂



Day 10: Travel day back home. It was very easy to return the rental care at Lihue Airport and there were no issues getting through security.



Oahu vs Kauai

Both islands are gorgeous and unique in their own way. Oahu is more fast paced and crowded while Kauai is very nature forward and more laidback. It honestly depends on what you want out of your trip! Both have touristy areas and nature areas. 





Things I wish we had done/eaten:

1. Explore Waimea Valley and falls
2. Ted’s Bakery on the North Shore (had been on previous trip, delicious lunch plates and pies)
3. Eaten saimin somewhere
4. The Musubi Truck on Kauai
5. More breweries on Oahu



Lodging

Oahu: Club Wyndham Royal Garden at Waikiki

Kauai: Kauai Coast Resort at the Beachboy



Rental Car: through Costco



Food and Drink Recommendations!

Oahu

* Leonard’s - Malasadas (our favorites were the dobash filled, guava filled, and original)
* Kono’s - Kalua pork nachos
* Green World Coffee Farm - coffee
* Matsumoto Shave Ice in Haleiwa - shave ice, my POG (passion fruit, orange, and guava) ice with sweetened condensed milk and mochi balls was delicious!
* Forty Niner Diner (Honolulu location) - Ube pancakes and big boy breakfast (the fried rice was soooo good with the meats and runny egg)
* Costco - Hot dog. Our cheapest meal!



Kauai

* Wailua Drive In - chili pepper and garlic chicken. We went here twice
* The Haven - coffee and pastries
* Napali Brewing Co - beautiful space with delicious food. The fries were super good. The beer was also really good.
* Sunrise Coffee - coffee, fun seasonal menu, We went here two days in row.
* Kaua’i Sushi Station - sushi food truck. Delicious rolls with amazing view of the mountains. Super friendly guy working. We had the Golden Tiger, Godzilla, and Fire Dragon rolls. We went here twice.
* Kauai Beer Company - good beer, chill place. Limited hours so check Instagram for current hours.
* Kenji Burger - delicious unique burgers with good fries.",4,1762216548.0,VisitingHawaii,3,1.0,False

1ont6x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baystreetbets/comments/1ont6x3/nexev_shit_penny_stock_or_bargain/,NEXE.V - shit penny stock or bargain?,"# NEXE DD and outlook

This is the first time I'm posting something like this - feedback is appreciated. I have been following NEXE since 2020 and don't have a ton of shares, but am considering buying more at these levels. I'm curious what people think about them. 

**Company Overview:**

NEXE Innovations is a Canadian‐based company focused on fully compostable materials and single-use packaging solutions for the consumer/coffee sector and beyond. They currently manufacture and sell a patented, fully compostable coffee pod for machines like Keurig & Nespresso. They generate revenue by producing coffee pods for a number of partners. They are currently trying to expand their partnerships in both Canada and the USA.

Stated mission: help eliminate single-use plastics by replacing conventional plastic/aluminum products with compostable alternatives.

***What is their TAM?***

Single serve coffee pods in North America generated roughly **$7.4 billion in 2025, up from about $5 billion in 2018, and projected to reach $10 billion by 2030**

*They are yet to go to market with any other products but are working on containers for various types of food. For now, the above is the only market they generate revenue in.*

***Competitive advantage/unique value proposition***

Enhanced extraction/coffee-experience compared to other compostable pods, in-house manufacturing, Keurig/Nespresso compatibility, B2B focus

***Main competitors***

Club Coffee, Cameron’s Coffee, Pod & Parcel, Fabula, San Francisco Bay Coffee

**Financial statement analysis**

***Balance sheet***

Positives:

\- Near-term liquidity: \~$12.3 million in cash/GICs and only \~$3.07 million in liabilities

\- Asset to debt ratio: Total assets \~$34.4 million vs total liabilities of \~$3.07 million = 11.2 asset to debt ratio

\- Manufacturing equipment: \~19.3 million in Property, Plant & Equipment - positioned to manufacture \~500 million pods per year, per company website

*- Book value per share is $0.32 - share price is $0.16*

Negatives:

\- Cash burn: They have over 3 years of runway left at current levels

\- Accumulated deficit: \~$46.9 million - revenue needs to increase significantly

\- Default on loan payment: direct quote from quarterly financials: “As of May 31, 2025, the Company defaulted on its quarterly payment and is negotiating with WEDC for a grace period and an extension of the loan maturity date.”

***Income statement***

\- Revenue in FY 2024 was only $149,264. It doubled to $307,543 in FY 2025 and is on track to (hopefully) double again ($500,000-600,000 seems quite realistic for FY2026)

\- Average revenue the last 3 quarters is \~$117,467

\- Current partnerships span 15 brands across 5 different companies.

\- Company received orders of over 700,000 pods in May alone from 3 customers, as well as a \~250,000 pod repeat order and a \~100,000 pod new purchase order in October, 2025

\- Q1 2026 shows positive gross margin for the first time ever (13.7%)

\- They need to significantly increase revenue to approach profitability

**Forward thoughts**

\- company is trading at a 50% discount to NAV (share price is $0.16-0.17, book value per share is $0.32)

\- they haven't issued additional shares since 2021 (aside from warrants and stock options being exercised but that's quite small)

\- revenue is finally climbing and should continue to

\- they will likely need to raise additional funds again before reaching profitability, but the revenue trajectory is encouraging

\- defaulting on a loan payment is concerning - given how much cash they apparently have on hand it doesn't make much sense, but if terms are re-negotiated it may not be a big issue

Is this a great company as it currently stands? Absolutely not. But should they be trading at a 50% NAV discount? I'd argue no. The company needs to string together a few strong quarters in a row for a significant spike in share price, but downside risk appears minimal. Any meaningful press release related to revenue growth should drive the price up bit by bit. FY 2026 earnings are going to be pivotal.

Believe me, I tried.

It started last Friday, I was getting ready for Halloween, and I spent most of the day outside carving pumpkins on my porch. My hands were coated in the slimy guts and pumpkin seeds when I saw someone walking down the street. He was tall, about 6’2, he had short, curly hair and a thick beard that seemingly swallowed his lips. He had a button up flannel shirt, overalls and a straw hat. He looked like any old farmer that passed by the house on a tractor, so I paid no mind to him until he stopped in front of my house and just stared at me. I did the courteous thing and waved at him, and he waved back in turn. Yet he didn’t budge.

“Can I help you?”

“Hm. You always say that.”

“I’m sorry?”

“Never mind.”

“…Okay?”

I went back to the pumpkins, and I started drawing the patterns for the jack-o’-lanterns. I was deep in concentration when I noticed the man was now walking up to me. I put my marker down and spoke,

“Change your mind?”

“No, but do you mind if I help?”

I thought it was odd to have a stranger carve pumpkins with me, but I had bought twelve, so I took the help. He was gifted with the knife, he put in an elaborate design that looked exactly like that spiral hill scene from *The Nightmare Before Christmas*. 

“Wow, that’s beautiful.” I told him.

He smiled as he sat it down next to him. He sighed and said,

“You’re a nice man, Franklin.” 

Only thing was is that I never told him my name. I looked at him and felt unease wash over me like a bucket of cold water.

“How do you know my name?”

“I just know these things, I know a lot of things. I know you got two dogs, one is a dachshund and the other is a chihuahua. Your daughters have named them Brat and Taco.”

“How do-“

“I’m not done. You’ve got a wife named Emily and today she’ll tell you that she’s pregnant with a little boy. And on the news, they’ll mention that an aerial strike from Russia will have struck the California coast.”

I laughed at first, expecting him to laugh with me, he had to have been a coworker of my wife’s or a friend of a friend. But he wasn’t laughing, he seemed overwhelmed with sadness.

“Listen, friend, I’d talk more but you’re making me feel a little weirded out. I think I’ll take care of the pumpkins.”

“God damn it.” He grumbled pinching his brow, “I’m sorry, I rushed it again, just let me explain it over coffee, do you have coffee?”

I was hesitant, he was odd but he didn’t strike me as a ‘dangerous’ person. I told him to wait on the porch, my wife asked me who I was talking to, and all I said it was some guy. I brought out two black cups of coffee outside, steam rolled off their times against the cold air. He smiled as he grabbed his cup.

I gave my cup one sip and asked,

“Well, I’m listening.”

“Right. It’s funny, I keep doing this, having this conversation with people. I keep thinking I have enough time on my hands each time I roll back to the beginning. I guess you could say it started when I died.”

I listened intently, and tried to hide my expression of complete bewilderment.

“Now, I know what you’re thinking. I sound like an insane person but just let me explain. I passed away on July 17th, 2051, ninety nine years old. I was ready to go home, embrace my Lord, and my family. And then I’m in a hospital surrounded by doctors, and I see my Mother holding me.”

“So, you were reincarnated?”

“No. Reborn. I was back to the year of my birth, but I was full of a life times worth of knowledge. I knew the outcome of so many events in not just my life but in history. I tried to change these events, but….”

“But what?”

The old man wiped his eyes.

“Would you believe me if the life you’re living right now is the best possible outcome?”

I thought about the current state of things. War, famine, genocide, poverty, so many awful things. I gave my answer:

“No. I’d like to think there’s a better life than…well, than this.”

The old man gripped my hand, his palm was callous and rough.

“I’ve been lived hundreds of lives. I’ve tried to change so many of them, but every change leads to something horrible. I tipped the FBI about the 9/11 terror attacks, but you know what happened afterward? The bastards tried again, went after that Year’s Super Bowl. Dove the plane right into the stadium. It’s like a house of cards, you pluck one thing out, it all goes to shit.”

I sipped my coffee, the man was obviously insane, so I decided to ask him a question. But before I could ask it, he said,

“You’re going to ask me what’s in hand. You’ve got three pennies and a quarter. Of maybe this time you’ve grabbed your keys which has a fidget attached to it. A little clicker I believe.”

I put the change back in my pocket and stared at him with a slack jawed expression. Before I asked him another question, he plucked the words from my lips,

“You’re gonna ask me for a detail about you only *you* would know….you had a daughter. Her name was going to be Robin, she was a stillborn.”

I felt my stomach drop and asked him,

“So, what are you exactly? Some sort of fucking time loop sage spouting out advice?”

“Listen, I’m not even sure what I am anymore, but all I can do is prepare people.”

“For what?”

“The end of everything.”

“I thought you died at 99.”

“Not of old age.”

He drank the rest of his coffee and seized a pumpkin. He extended an open palm to me,

“May I?”

I handed him a knife, and he started whittling away at the gourd.

“Today. Russia will strike the California coast.”

“You mentioned that earlier. When?”

He looked at his watch and with heavy eyes he told me,

“Six hours from now. You’ll get a notification about it soon.”

“And what then?”

“A Third World War, it’ll be quick.”

“Jesus. What happens?”

“The missiles will fly, and the presidents will point fingers and make claims. But both sides don’t have enough humility to end the war to save their own nations. In the end, the people rise up, start killing their leaders in the streets. Just like the French Revolution.”

“What about us? Everyone living around here?”

“To be honest, we don’t see a lot of conflict outside of the occasional air raid where we’ve got to go to storm shelters and bunkers. When the dust settles, things will be good for a while.”

“For a while?”

“Unfortunately, we neglected the planet to the point of no return. Many animals die, coral reefs blackened by oil, smog covered skies- enjoy the blue sky while you can because after the war, it ain’t coming back. It’ll be hard to breathe, and then…”

He was silent, he dropped the jack-o’-lantern onto the grass, and clasped his hands together.

“The atmosphere starts to erode, by the time I was in the nursing home…it just…I can’t even describe it. It’s just like the earth we knew and then it was overtaken by a sudden darkness. That’s the last thing I remembered, the screams of terror, and then…it all goes black.”

“Why tell me?”

“Why not? I’m here for some reason and I think it’s to help common folk like y’all. It’ll be hard, but you’ll survive until it’s time for the earth to end.”

I felt a rush existential fear overtake me, I was beginning to shake, but he took my hand and spoke softly.

“It’s not here yet, but it will be. Be prepared.”

And then, he was gone. Like I’d never even met him. I tried looking for him in town but there’s no sign of him. I write this because maybe I should be sharing his message too. If you see him, listen to him.

As I’m writing this up, I’m looking at the television showing images of scorched California coastal cities. The president will be speaking in 10 minutes, and the number one thing trending on social media right now is World War 3. Even after our conversation, I was hoping he was just some nut who was able to luckily guess some details about my life. But now I know he was telling the truth.

* **Entrepreneurship and scaling between China and the US** – I’d enjoy exchanging ideas and experiences

**Looking to connect with:**

* Entrepreneurs or business owners interested in the US market
* Students or professionals in tech, business, or sourcing
* Anyone involved in import/export or product development
* Or simply open-minded people who enjoy deep conversations about culture and innovation

I’m happy to grab coffee or a meal and share perspectives from the Silicon Valley scene, or just learn more about what you're working on. I’m also open to discussing potential collaboration if there’s a good fit.

The weather gets cold, the holidays are coming, and you feel that pull to cozy up and let all your good habits hibernate until January 1st. We treat October as the last sprint and December as a lost cause.

But I’m here to tell you that November is the most critical month for building real discipline.

Think about the physical world right now: the trees have dropped their beautiful leaves. They aren’t showing off anymore. All the colorful, flashy energy of summer and fall is gone. What’s left? The essential structure. The bare branches, the roots, and the trunk, the elements that survive the winter.

This is exactly what your discipline needs.

The ""Bare Branches"" Discipline Philosophy
Stop trying to achieve ""big, flashy-leafed"" goals this month. You don't need to try to overhaul your entire life. November is for building the structure that will allow you to survive the holiday chaos and launch into the new year with genuine momentum.

Here is how you shift your focus:

1. Prioritize Survival Habits Over Growth Habits
In the past, my November goal was ""Gain 10 lbs of muscle and start a side business."" A disaster. This year, my goals are focused on non-negotiable stability:

• Sleep: Go to bed at 11 PM, no matter what. (Survival habit)

• Water: Drink 8 glasses a day, non-negotiable. (Survival habit)

• Move: 20-minute walk, 3x a week. (Survival habit)

These are the bare branches. They keep you alive, healthy, and functional. Focus on these small wins, and they will act as your anchor when the holiday parties and family stresses hit.

2. Embrace the ""Inner Work"" of Gratitude (Yes, really)
November is National Gratitude Month, and here's why that’s a discipline hack: Discipline requires sustained emotional energy. Regret and self-criticism (which fuels most of our discipline attempts) are draining. Gratitude is fueling.

Take five minutes every morning and list three tiny things you're grateful for (the hot coffee, a comfortable pillow, a deadline you met). This trains your brain to look for the positive, which gives you the emotional capacity to handle setbacks without spiraling into shame. You literally become more resilient.

3. Define Your ""Winter Structure"" Now

December is going to be messy. Accept it. Use November to decide what your absolute lowest effort looks like.

• If your ideal is lifting weights 5x a week, your Winter Structure minimum might be 20 minutes of bodyweight exercises, 3x a week.

• If your ideal is journaling for 30 minutes, your Winter Structure minimum is writing one sentence.

By building the bare bones of your routine this month, you won't feel like you failed when life gets hectic next month. You'll just be sticking to your essential structure.

November isn't a month to rest; it’s a month to fortify. Let go of the flashy goals, and focus on the essential, unsexy structure that keeps you going.

What's the one ""survival habit"" you are choosing to anchor your discipline in this November? Let's commit to making it stick!",1,1762216243.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False
1ont4zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ont4zi/i_talked_to_a_man_who_says_hes_stuck_in_an/,I talked to a man who says he’s stuck in an endless cycle & some of the things he talked about are coming true.,"Let me preface this by saying that I do not know this man, I can’t find his name anywhere on social media, or in any sort of database. Believe me, I tried.

It started last Friday, I was getting ready for Halloween, and I spent most of the day outside carving pumpkins on my porch. My hands were coated in the slimy guts and pumpkin seeds when I saw someone walking down the street. He was tall, about 6’2, he had short, curly hair and a thick beard that seemingly swallowed his lips. He had a button up flannel shirt, overalls and a straw hat. He looked like any old farmer that passed by the house on a tractor, so I paid no mind to him until he stopped in front of my house and just stared at me. I did the courteous thing and waved at him, and he waved back in turn. Yet he didn’t budge.

“Can I help you?”

“Hm. You always say that.”

“I’m sorry?”

“Never mind.”

“…Okay?”

I went back to the pumpkins, and I started drawing the patterns for the jack-o’-lanterns. I was deep in concentration when I noticed the man was now walking up to me. I put my marker down and spoke,

“Change your mind?”

“No, but do you mind if I help?”

I thought it was odd to have a stranger carve pumpkins with me, but I had bought twelve, so I took the help. He was gifted with the knife, he put in an elaborate design that looked exactly like that spiral hill scene from *The Nightmare Before Christmas*. 

“Wow, that’s beautiful.” I told him.

He smiled as he sat it down next to him. He sighed and said,

“You’re a nice man, Franklin.” 

Only thing was is that I never told him my name. I looked at him and felt unease wash over me like a bucket of cold water.

“How do you know my name?”

“I just know these things, I know a lot of things. I know you got two dogs, one is a dachshund and the other is a chihuahua. Your daughters have named them Brat and Taco.”

“How do-“

“I’m not done. You’ve got a wife named Emily and today she’ll tell you that she’s pregnant with a little boy. And on the news, they’ll mention that an aerial strike from Russia will have struck the California coast.”

I laughed at first, expecting him to laugh with me, he had to have been a coworker of my wife’s or a friend of a friend. But he wasn’t laughing, he seemed overwhelmed with sadness.

“Listen, friend, I’d talk more but you’re making me feel a little weirded out. I think I’ll take care of the pumpkins.”

“God damn it.” He grumbled pinching his brow, “I’m sorry, I rushed it again, just let me explain it over coffee, do you have coffee?”

I was hesitant, he was odd but he didn’t strike me as a ‘dangerous’ person. I told him to wait on the porch, my wife asked me who I was talking to, and all I said it was some guy. I brought out two black cups of coffee outside, steam rolled off their times against the cold air. He smiled as he grabbed his cup.

I gave my cup one sip and asked,

“Well, I’m listening.”

“Right. It’s funny, I keep doing this, having this conversation with people. I keep thinking I have enough time on my hands each time I roll back to the beginning. I guess you could say it started when I died.”

I listened intently, and tried to hide my expression of complete bewilderment.

“Now, I know what you’re thinking. I sound like an insane person but just let me explain. I passed away on July 17th, 2051, ninety nine years old. I was ready to go home, embrace my Lord, and my family. And then I’m in a hospital surrounded by doctors, and I see my Mother holding me.”

“So, you were reincarnated?”

“No. Reborn. I was back to the year of my birth, but I was full of a life times worth of knowledge. I knew the outcome of so many events in not just my life but in history. I tried to change these events, but….”

“But what?”

The old man wiped his eyes.

“Would you believe me if the life you’re living right now is the best possible outcome?”

I thought about the current state of things. War, famine, genocide, poverty, so many awful things. I gave my answer:

“No. I’d like to think there’s a better life than…well, than this.”

The old man gripped my hand, his palm was callous and rough.

“I’ve been lived hundreds of lives. I’ve tried to change so many of them, but every change leads to something horrible. I tipped the FBI about the 9/11 terror attacks, but you know what happened afterward? The bastards tried again, went after that Year’s Super Bowl. Dove the plane right into the stadium. It’s like a house of cards, you pluck one thing out, it all goes to shit.”

I sipped my coffee, the man was obviously insane, so I decided to ask him a question. But before I could ask it, he said,

“You’re going to ask me what’s in hand. You’ve got three pennies and a quarter. Of maybe this time you’ve grabbed your keys which has a fidget attached to it. A little clicker I believe.”

I put the change back in my pocket and stared at him with a slack jawed expression. Before I asked him another question, he plucked the words from my lips,

“You’re gonna ask me for a detail about you only *you* would know….you had a daughter. Her name was going to be Robin, she was a stillborn.”

I felt my stomach drop and asked him,

“So, what are you exactly? Some sort of fucking time loop sage spouting out advice?”

“Listen, I’m not even sure what I am anymore, but all I can do is prepare people.”

“For what?”

“The end of everything.”

“I thought you died at 99.”

“Not of old age.”

He drank the rest of his coffee and seized a pumpkin. He extended an open palm to me,

“May I?”

I handed him a knife, and he started whittling away at the gourd.

“Today. Russia will strike the California coast.”

“You mentioned that earlier. When?”

He looked at his watch and with heavy eyes he told me,

“Six hours from now. You’ll get a notification about it soon.”

“And what then?”

“A Third World War, it’ll be quick.”

The Spartans Under Floodlight










November put its teeth on the field.

Frost rimmed the painted lines; breath rose like pale flags. 

The floodlights hummed their old electric hymn, and the metal bleachers gathered the cold and handed it back through tights and palms.

They stayed anyway.

Spartans in hoodies and letterman jackets, cleats untied, pads dumped in a loose orbit. 

A dented thermos made its slow rounds, burned coffee and cinnamon, a mercy. 

The portable speaker hiccupped through a playlist and died on the same two chords whenever it drifted within six feet of Kai.

“Your vibe kills Bluetooth,” Mike said, blowing steam off the lid of his cup.

Grinning like it was nothing, like the hairs on his arms hadn’t just stood up when Kai laughed.

“Maybe the air just knows who’s in charge,” Aspen said under his breath, toque shadowing his eyes. 

He looked everywhere but at Kai and somehow never stopped tracking him.

Sequoia sat one step up, hands cupped around the thermos, listening the way trees listen.

She hadn’t said much since the gym. 

She didn’t need to; the air kept making room for her.

“Field feels louder tonight,” Mike said, eyes on the dark end zone.

“It’s the wind,” someone offered.

There wasn’t any. 

Not a leaf moved, not a flag stirred. 

Even their breath hung too long before fading. 

The wind had stopped hours ago, and still the place sounded full, like something else was breathing for it.

Steam rose slow and straight from their cups. 

For a long time, none of them spoke. 

It wasn’t awkward, just aware, like the air was listening too.

Aspen drummed his fingers once. 

Mike cracked his knuckles.

Sequoia traced the rim of her cup. 

Each small sound landed heavier than it should. 

And every time Kai shifted, even just to breathe, the world seemed to realign around him, the way water finds level after a stone drops.

No one said a thing. 

But they all felt it, something gathering, waiting for his next inhale.

They didn’t mention the gulls that wheeled once over the scoreboard and then hung there, as if pinned to the beam. 

They didn’t mention how the coach’s whistle stalled on an inhale until Kai lifted two fingers and the note spilled out, late, embarrassed. 

They were just high-schoolers after practice. 

That was all.

“You ever notice it’s warmer at the fifty?” 

Mike stomped his cleat. 

Ice crackled somewhere beyond the lights.. 

At midfield, the paint gleamed wet, a little alive.

“Ground’s got memory,” he added.

“Or somebody keeps waking it up.” 

Aspen said, rolling the football under his arch like a monk turning prayer beads.

Kai leaned back on his hands, gloves abandoned beside him, a private weather rising from his wrists. 

He didn’t say much. 
He never had to. 

The air around him moved like it knew him. 

When he exhaled, the speaker found the beat again, half a shade deeper. 

When he smiled, the floodlights brightened as if the generator had remembered a promise.

“Practice tomorrow?” 

Kai asked, simple, ordinary. 

He rubbed a thumb over the callus near his knuckle. 

Above him a light flickered, then steadied, the beam bending faintly toward him as if recalling its maker.

“Early drills,” Mike said. 

“Coach says the weather’s turning.”

“It already has,” Aspen said. 

He didn’t mean the air.

They slid into chatter that looks like nothing and holds everything: midterms; a rumor about a fight that never happened but made hallways careful; the way Sequoia’s note in the gym had made the ceiling breathe.

“Don’t start,” Sequoia said, soft, without looking up. 

“It was just a song.”

It wasn’t.

“Yeah,” Mike said. 

“And a door.”

No one pushed it.

Fingers tapped the bleacher, one-two, one-two-three, unconsciously matching the rhythm of Kai’s foot on metal.

When he stopped, they stopped, and nobody noticed they were following anything at all.

A siren far off. 

A bus sighed. 

November smelled like galvanized steel, cinnamon, apple peels, and the first courage of winter.

Mike offered the thermos; Kai reached without looking, hand finding it like muscle memory.

The stream hit the cup soft and steady, a sound warmer than the air. 

Their hands brushed, and the sound seemed to linger, like the night had paused to listen.

“You good?” 

Mike asked, casual.

“Yeah.” 

Kai’s breath made a small cloud, then none at all. 

He flexed his hands once, as if something inside them was warming faster than skin.

Aspen finally met his eyes. 

Not a challenge. 

Not surrender. 

Just the quick, private look people share when a secret starts keeping them. 

He’d always felt pulled toward Kai, gravity with a name, but lately it wasn’t pull; it was tether.

A quiet thread through his ribs, answering every breath Kai took.

“Don’t be late,” Aspen said. 

He meant tomorrow. 

He meant everything.

They drifted, the way you do when you don’t want a thing to end. 

One by one, they stood and stretched and pretended their muscles weren’t buzzing like powerlines after rain. 

No one mentioned the static when their shoulders brushed Kai’s. 

No one mentioned how shoulders loosened when he was near, or how something in the chest cinched when he turned away.

On the track, two students ran past, breath white in the cold.

One slowed, frowning, then smiled, like she’d forgotten she was running, like her body had just remembered a song.

“Tomorrow,” Mike said, tapping the rail twice. 

The metal sang a note that hung a heartbeat too long.

“Tomorrow,” Kai answered.

Sequoia pulled her hood up.

Aspen shoved his toque in a pocket. 

Mike lingered at the fifty, palm pressed to paint like a blessing, or like he was receiving one.

Steam rose straight as threads.

No wind. 

No reason for the hush, and yet the field held its breath.

Kai set his cup down and let his fingers find the old gouge in the bench, the one the nail had started and time had finished.

Heat moved through the wood like a memory waking. 

He tasted pitch. 

Salt. 

Iron.

Not here. 
Not now.

Sequoia’s head tipped, listening to what most people call silence.

“Do you feel that?”

Mike didn’t answer. 

He was watching the way the stadium light seemed to lean toward Kai and then think better of it.

Aspen looked away first. 

“It’ll pass,” he said, too quickly. 

It never did.

The mark under Kai’s thumb pulsed once, twice, like a heart remembering its job. 

The bleachers’ chill dropped out; the air grew old, older than November, older than Lorne Park. 

The field slid a half step to the side, and the night opened like a page.

The Archive unscrolled.

A ridge of stone rose in his chest. 

A fortress loomed on a sky that hadn’t learned his name yet. 

He didn’t close his eyes. 

He didn’t have to.

The thread caught.

The air thinned, colour draining from the field, from the breath between them, from the century itself.

Metal turned to dust.

Frost to sand.

Somewhere in the distance, floodlights burned themselves into torches, and the hum of the generator became the roar of wind against stone.

Sound folded.

Light bent.

Memory changed its accent.

He was no longer sitting on aluminum but standing on something older, sun-bleached, infinite.

The field became a ridge.

And the ridge burned.













●●●●●●●●








Scroll of Salt and Ash
















The General’s Burden 🛡














Masada burned in the distance.

Not with fire.

Not yet.

But with tension, the kind that simmers behind the walls of conquest, the kind that vibrates beneath the marble of villas, inside the ankles of slaves who’ve been still too long.

The sun had begun its descent over the Judean ridge, staining the stone fortress in bruises of ochre and blood.

Caesilius Antoni stood on the southern balcony of his command estate, a goblet of chilled wine forgotten in his hand. 

Behind him, a columned hall stretched deep into wealth-lion-pawed chairs of imported cedar, silken banners from Alexandria, a brass harp untouched for months.

He did not see it.

He saw the ridge. 
He saw the rebels. 

He saw, beneath all of it, something he could not name.

The sandals at his feet had been cleaned twice since sunrise. 

His armor rested in perfect array on the rack beside the door. 

His personal scribe, a eunuch named Eligos, stood two steps behind, still as marble.

""They’ll resist,"" Caecilius said quietly.

Eligos blinked.

""The Zealots, dominus?""

""No. 

The wind.""

Eligos tilted his head.

""Shall I ready the messengers to Jerusalem?""

""No. 

Let them rot a little longer.""

He turned.

The evening light caught his face-bronzed, clean-shaven, hard-jawed with a noble’s symmetry.

There was no softness to Caecilius, but there was poise.

Men called him the Hawk of the East, though none had ever seen him lose his temper.

He walked back inside. 

A slave-girl bowed too slowly.

Eligos flinched, but Caecilius waved it off.

""She’s new,"" he said. 

""She’s terrified,"" 
Eligos whispered.

Caecilius didn’t reply.

In his private chamber, he disrobed slowly. 

Not from vanity. 

From exhaustion.

He stripped the tunic and traced his fingers over the carved bust of his father-Senator Gaius Antonius, who had died with a golden coin in one hand and a bloodied contract in the other.

Above it hung a scroll-framed decree of Caecilius's own appointment to supreme command of the Tenth Legion in Judea.

He tapped it once. 

Then turned away.

The bath was drawn. 

Rose oil. 
Cypress smoke.

Everything precise.

Two slaves waited.

One male. 
One female.

Both stripped to the waist. 

Oiled. 

Perfect.

He paused at the threshold.

Then: ""Out.""

They bowed. 

Vanished.

Caecilius entered the water alone.

He sank slowly, until only his nose and eyes crested the surface.

 Silence rose like steam.

In the corner, the carved tile showed a bear and a hawk, locked in spiral. 

A decorative piece, commissioned during his first victory in Syria. 

He had chosen it without thinking. 

Now, he stared.

A bear. 

A hawk. 

Facing. 
Twined.

Something twisted in his chest.

He exhaled. 

Reached beneath the water, touched the old scar beneath his left pectoral. 

A raised mark. 
Barely visible. 

But it had always been there.

Shaped like roots. 

Or a tree.

He pressed it.

And for one moment - He felt watched.

He dried himself without assistance.

His tunic, woven black with bronze threading, was laid out across the bed. 

Beside it sat a sealed letter. 

The wax bore the insignia of the House of Aurelian.

He broke it open.

The parchment read like an edict:

“The Senate has voted unanimous approval for your engagement to Lady Vitalia Septima. 

The union shall be formalized in two cycles. 

Her dowry includes three estates, two vineyards, and the naval rights to the Port of Brundisium. 

Her womb, unspoiled. 
Her lineage, intact. 

Her father awaits your reply.”

There was no signature.

Caecilius folded the parchment neatly. 

Set it in the brazier. 
And watched it burn.

At the evening meal, Vitalia herself sat beside him.

She was beautiful. 

Educated. 

Perfectly postured.

Her gown shimmered like Roman water. 

Her voice sang like well-practiced submission. 

She had teeth white enough to satisfy even the inner courts of Augustus.

""My father says you are destined for something greater than the East.""

Caecilius sipped wine.

""Your father says many things.""

She smiled politely.

""And what do you say?""

""I say that destiny is a word for men who never bled.""

She tilted her head, intrigued but cautious.

""Have you never considered a quieter life, General?""

He looked at her then, 
really looked.

""Have you ever seen the inside of a dying man’s chest?""

She said nothing more.

That night, he did not touch her.

Though her servants whispered that she had prepared herself with perfume and oils.

Though the city waited for confirmation.

Caecilius sat by the window.
And watched Masada burn quietly in the dark.



Not with fire. 
Not yet.

But it would come.

The following morning, Caecilius made the rounds.

He walked through the villa’s eastern wing, a section reserved for administrative affairs and high-ranking tribunes. 

Slaves bowed as he passed: accountants, scribes, translators, water-bearers. 

None dared speak. 

Their silence was not fear.

It was etiquette. 

Caecilius demanded it.

But not cruelty.

He corrected a soldier who had slapped a servant boy for misplacing a wax tablet.

""Discipline is for those trained to wield it.""

He instructed the cooks to feed the morning leftovers to the sick rather than the pigs.

When a seamstress dropped her basket of dyed cloth and scrambled to clean it, Caecilius crouched, lifted a bolt of royal blue linen, and handed it to her without a word.

The woman blinked. 

Bowed. 

Trembled.

He continued walking.

It was in these small moments that the truth of him began to whisper.

He did not believe in the ritualized rape of slaves.

He did not bed them for sport.

Not because Rome forbid it-Rome encouraged it.

But because it disgusted him.

Because his mother had told him at twelve:

""Take what is beneath you, and you become it.""

And even now, despite the women, despite the honors, despite the invitation to return to Rome and join the Senate itself…

He still felt like something in him was waiting.

Not ambition.
Recognition.

And somewhere, Masada watched.















-----









 The Four Walls of Power














The day began with bronze.

Not the ceremonial kind. 

Not polished. 

Not for show.

Real bronze, weather-bitten, sun-streaked, hammered into the belly of the garrison yard with the clang of discipline. 

Shields against stone. 

Spears against wood. 

Bodies against the weight of history.

Caesilius Antoni stood beneath the carved arch of the upper terrace, arms crossed, tunic crisp, silent. 

Below him, the morning drills unfolded in perfect sequence.

Eighty men. 

Four ranks. 

Movements synchronized by shouted Latin. 

Sweat glistened. 

Dust rose. 

Somewhere, a musician kept time with a small hand-drum.

He said nothing.
He watched everything.

Behind him, a scroll-bearing aide cleared his throat.

“Dominus, the record from Damascus has arrived. 

Governor Valerian’s seal intact.”

Caecilius did not turn.

“Read it.”

The aide broke the seal with careful hands.

“Acknowledgment of shipment.

Sixteen Gaulish captives, one injured in transport. 

No replacements offered. 

Seven classified as viable for forced conscription. 

Eight for labor. 

One for private instruction.”

A pause.

“The one for private instruction, reason given?”

“Beauty.”

Caeciliu's jaw twitched.

“Have him sent to the lower ranks. 

If he bleeds, he earns his place.

If not, he dies.”

“Yes, dominus.”

The aide bowed and left.

By midday, the Masada sun had peeled the sky raw. 

Slaves moved like ghosts through the corridors, carrying platters of salted dates, amphorae of water, spiced chickpeas and honey bread for the midday break. 

None made eye contact.

Caecilius walked the long colonnade alone.

This was the second wall of Roman power: 

Ritual.

The repetition of structure, the muscle-memory of empire. 

Every day, the same routes. Every afternoon, the same meals. 

Every evening, the same reports, the same deductions, the same corrections.

He stopped at the edge of the garden.

A boy-ten, maybe-was trimming fig leaves under the eyes of an older slave. 

The boy’s hands shook. 
The blade slipped. 

He gasped. 

Blood dotted the leaf’s edge.



The older man moved to strike him.

“Don’t.”

Caecilius's voice stopped the hand midair.

The boy dropped to his knees.

Bowed.

Caecilius crouched. 

Took the blade. 

Trimmed the next leaf.

“Even fig trees bleed.”

He handed the blade back.

The boy wept without sound.

That night, he wanted to dine alone.

Not out of preference. 

Out of arrangement.

Vitalia Septima had returned to Jerusalem. 

Her absence was political, not personal. 

She had excused herself with a whispered promise: 

“When next we meet, I’ll have a gift worthy of your patience.”

He did not miss her.

In her place, three seats were filled with guests from Rome-an architect, a senator’s nephew, and a young naval officer who spoke too quickly and laughed too hard.

They toasted victories.

Compared vineyards. 

Mocked the Judean rebels with lazy ignorance.

“Like rats in a shrine,” 
said the senator’s nephew.

 “Pious little bastards.”

Caecilius didn’t respond.

He chewed his roasted lamb slowly. 

Drank his wine like it was medicine.

After dinner, the guests requested a tour of the inner halls. 

They wanted to see the storied salt vaults and the sacred scroll room beneath the baths.

Caecilius declined.

“The night is not for flaunting. 

It is for holding your gods quietly.”

They laughed. 

He did not.

Later, alone in the scroll chamber, he lit a single oil lamp.

The flame danced over his father’s records, treaties, oaths, and one unfinished letter addressed to 

“my son, in case I fall before you ascend.”

Caecilius had never read it.

He left it sealed.

Instead, he opened his own notebook.

Leather-bound. 

Private.

He wrote:

“I cannot feel the walls anymore. 

I know they are here. 

I built them. 

I walk them. 

I defend them. 

But I do not feel them.

What would happen if I touched something without command? 

If I reached not to own, but to answer?”

He stopped. 

Closed the book.
Blew out the lamp.

Just before dawn, as the sky bled pale orange across the fortress, a runner knocked on his chamber door.

“Dominus, you’re needed in the barracks.”

“Why?”

“One of the Gauls broke formation. 

Refused orders. 

Challenged the centurion.”

Caecilius dressed without a word.

When he arrived, a circle had formed.

Soldiers stood tense, their spears lowered. 

In the center stood a figure, back turned, shirtless, dust-streaked, breathing like a lion.

His back was tattooed with foreign sigils. 

His hands were cut.

He was smiling.

Not in defiance. 
In recognition.

Caecilius froze.

He didn’t speak.
He just watched.

“Name?” 

he asked eventually.

The centurion replied:

“Arverni.”

Caecilius's lips parted.

He did not repeat the name.

He just stepped forward.

And the world began to change

1ont2w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1ont2w0/no_kings_day_shock/,No Kings Day shock,"I (65 HLF) saw my ex-husband (64 LLM) from a distance during the No Kings Day rally in our county. Me, on “security detail,” and he, across the plaza, also saw me. And, it’s been on my mind ever since. Hard to tell from a distance, but I think he's aged well. That’s not the issue, although of course it is, in a way: I’m running out of time to fight fascism, to contribute meaningfully, and to have unencumbered human interactions. Even though our marriage ended 25 years ago and I have built a beautiful family and life without him, just seeing him again made me feel small. 



I spent 10 years with the man. Throughout our marriage, we had sex approximately once-a-year, so maybe 10 times total, and not at all during the last few years. I did everything I could think of, including begging, sobbing and negotiating, to no avail. Many reading, like me, know the anguish of that particular kind of rejection. He even got upset if he heard me masterbating, as though I was doing it to spite him. He blamed his lack of interest on my, “inability to communicate,” or an upset stomach, or the room being too hot, in rotation. Several times he told me I was overly sexual, as if that was a character flaw. It was weird, because otherwise he was a very nice guy; everyone liked him. 



At the time we split, we were attending classes through a veterans’ program after returning from overseas where I served a stint in the Army. Easily the most charismatic guy in any circle, and a musician, he readily made friends with my fellow soldiers in Germany, and in my hometown. My mother was a faculty member on the same campus we were attending. She had been teaching there my entire life, so we kind of had an in. My ex did, in fact, get his first job upon our arrival through those connections.

 

During that time so many years ago, he basically turned the campus coffee shop into his office. I think he actually had a reserved table. That’s where, about 25 years ago, he broadcast the ugly details of our divorce. Of course, he didn’t mention our bedroom issues when he roasted me, to probably half of the staff and students on campus, for cheating on him. 



It was bad; I’m not gonna deny it. But, I’ve owned my role completely and never said a word about the lack of intimacy in our marriage to anyone. I carried all the blame and the shame. Now, I do wish I had divorced him for cause: Alienation of Affection. Then, at least, my side would have been public record. As it stands, several hundred of my coffee-drinking peers   heard the details of how I cuckholded my ex-husband. It reached my family too, of course. My 101-year-old grandfather was told by my ex-brother-in-law. 



Why do I still hold a grudge? Well, his friends do. One of his previous bandmates spit at me in a club recently, while calling me fat, as he did so. I felt like a pariah, at least in the early years, anytime I ran into people from our old life. I lost friends on two continents. Even recently, I’ve heard the catch in people's voices when they read or say my name; and I’ve felt the coldness others have exhibited upon recognizing me. It is always uncomfortable for both me and the other party.



After so long, our marriage shouldn’t still be an issue, but it is. 



Because, as I’ve learned, my ex-husband has moved back. And as old, progressive folks, our circles of friends are bound to overlap. I doubt he is still talking about our divorce. But so many folks already know. And most can’t imagine any justification for my lapse in judgement. After all, it seemed like we had a pretty perfect union. We didn’t fight, we worked well together generally and had a pretty good life.



So, readers, should I still burn with shame over the mistake I made long ago? And, how should I navigate this new reality?



This is not a throw-away account. I don’t know how to do that, and besides, I don’t care if anyone recognizes me or my ex in this post.

Hey you— I’m hoping to meet someone kind, fun, and genuine who’s open to getting to know each other and seeing where things lead. I’m not in a rush — I think the best connections grow naturally, with a mix of chemistry, laughter, and real conversation.

A little about me:
I’m 45, 5’10, around 200lbs — born and raised in NJ but spent my 20s bouncing between the Midwest and the South (so I’ve got a soft spot for southern charm and diner coffee). I’m sweet, affectionate, and believe in treating people with kindness, respect, and love.

I love to laugh — the kind of laugh that sneaks up on you until you can’t stop. I’m happiest outdoors, hiking, exploring new places, reading, or finding a new restaurant to try (especially if dessert’s involved). I’m also a bit of a DIY guy — I can fix things around the house, but I’ll probably still end up swearing at IKEA furniture along the way.

I’d love to meet someone who’s curious, playful, and knows how to mix depth with fun — someone who enjoys good banter, a little flirting, and those slow-burn moments where you can feel the connection building.

So, what’s something that made you smile this week?

1ont15g,https://v.redd.it/v0ed20srw4zf1,Vermax CFI-2039C,"Hello po! New to coffee/espresso making here— before I get roasted in the comments— I didn’t buy the machine po it was just gifted to my mom and since she’s not familiar with machine use I’ve become her designated home barista 😅😅. 

The machine is useable, no hiccups so far! However- I’m definitely looking for ways to improve the quality and experience (well, as best as I can try at least). 

I’ve pulled a few shots of espresso already but tbh what bothers me is the portafilter basket/cup as it is pressurized (?) with only a tiny hole on the other end. I’ve looked online on how to clean it without leaving water inside (when I shake it I can still hear liquid) but unlike other pressurized baskets this one doesn’t disassemble (kinda gross if you think about it 🥹). My current way of dealing with it is just flushing it with the machine but I’m hoping to find better suggestions on here! 

At the moment I’m considering replacing the baskets however another issue I’ve run into is that the basket probably won’t lock in place as Vermax has a different “lock” mechanism for their portafilter. I’ve also thought about replacing the portafilter altogether but I’m seeing majority reviews saying it just leaks for them. Overall I think my mom’s espresso fixation is temporary so this will probably serve its purpose til my mom runs out of interest, though if she really does get invested I’ll definitely suggest upgrading once we can. 

Highly considering the basket option and just removing the whole thing entirely to clean since I’m only making espresso for one person so I don’t think I mind being unable to knock the puck out- but I’d love to hear your thoughts and advice as well!

1ont0vh,https://i.redd.it/3s9e8psqw4zf1.jpeg,My Boss Thinks He Can Control Where Employees Can and Cannot Heed Nature's Call,"Today I came to share with you a literally ""shit"" situation that happens in the company where I work.

My boss truly believes that it is within his scope of duty to control which bathroom employees can take a paid dump in. There is a bathroom in the parking lot and another in the office. And employees are only allowed to shit in the parking lot. 

The daily routine around this office bathroom is funny because my boss works hard to monitor the flow of employees and the time they spend in there. It's almost as if you had to punch in and out of that bathroom. If an employee spends too long there, he goes to the bathroom and sees if it has that characteristic tropical shit fragrance that gets when you try to hide the torpedo smell with a poor quality deodorizer.

If he notices the smell? ~Gossip~ information from security tells us he's going there in person to check the footage to see who used the bathroom before him. With the information in hand and without the fear of making a mistake about what the employee did behind closed doors, he goes and actually verbalizes that ""he can only shit in the parking lot bathroom because it smells in the office.""

It is very hypocritical of this being broken into. He's a gym aficionado (not that that's a problem), but for us, mere mortals, it matters a lot when every day he arrives in the kitchen and orders the cooks to cook a dozen eggs for him at 7:30 in the morning. > EVERY DAY <. And of course that morning coffee helps to loosen all the bowels of the man, who farts all morning in the office. It's terrible. I've never seen anyone have as much gas as this guy. When, in meetings, he says that the team needs to step up its work to achieve its goals, we laugh our asses off during breaks.

And of course he also drinks a lot of water. So, this guy goes to the bathroom all the time.

So, do you really think that when nature calls and your underwear feels heavy, when you wonder if farts have weight while your legs shake, do you really think that someone will go down to the seventh level of Dante's hell to take a shit in a bathroom in a parking lot that doesn't even have an internet signal to prolong the shit while we roll reels? OF COURSE NOT.

The staff makes a point of shitting there until he gets really angry and brings us together to talk about how disrespectful we are being by shitting near his office.

Anyway, I can't even tell you how irritated he gets when an employee leaves the submarine swimming in the toilet on purpose knowing that he will probably go to the bathroom next.

I think him being bald just proves to us that the power went to his head and took much more than his sanity.

Just one detail: the daily eggs are every day at 7:30 in the morning and 4:00 in the afternoon. I feel sorry for the guy's wife who must be rotten from sleeping next to a fart machine like this guy.

I have been following NEXE since 2020 and don't have a ton of shares, but am considering buying more at these levels. I'm curious what people who don't know about them think but want to share with my fellow bag holders first.

  
**Company Overview:**

  
NEXE Innovations is a Canadian‐based company focused on fully compostable materials and single-use packaging solutions for the consumer/coffee sector and beyond. They currently manufacture and sell a patented, fully compostable coffee pod for machines like Keurig & Nespresso. They generate revenue by producing coffee for a number of partners. They are currently trying to expand their partnerships in both Canada and the USA.

Stated mission: help eliminate single-use plastics by replacing conventional plastic/aluminum products with compostable alternatives.

  
***What is their TAM?***

  
Single serve coffee pods in North America generated roughly **$7.4 billion in 2025, up from about $5 billion in 2018, and projected to reach $10 billion by 2030**

They are yet to go to market with any other products but are working on containers for various types of food. For now,  the above numbers are accurate as it’s the only market they generate revenue in.

***Competitive advantage/unique value proposition***

Enhanced extraction/coffee-experience compared to other compostable pods, in-house manufacturing, Keurig/Nespresso compatibility, B2B focus

***Main competitors***

Club Coffee, Cameron’s Coffee, Pod & Parcel, Fabula, San Francisco Bay Coffee

  
**Financial statement analysis**

***Balance sheet***

Positives:

\- Near-term liquidity: \~$12.3 million in cash/GICs and only \~$3.07 million in liabilities

\- Asset to debt ratio: Total assets \~$34.4 million vs total liabilities of \~$3.07 million = 11.2 asset to debt ratio

\- Manufacturing equipment: \~19.3 million in Property, Plant & Equipment - positioned to manufacture \~500 million pods per year, per company website

\- Book value per share is $0.32 - share price is $0.16



Negatives:

\- Cash burn: They have roughly 3 years of runway left at current levels 

\- Accumulated deficit: \~$46.9 million - revenue needs to increase significantly 

\- Default on loan payment: direct quote from quarterly financials: “As of May 31, 2025, the Company defaulted on its quarterly payment and is negotiating with WEDC for a grace period and an extension of the loan maturity date.”

***Income statement***

\- Revenue in FY 2024 was only $149,264. It doubled to $307,543 in FY 2025 and is on track to (hopefully) double again ($500,000-600,000 seems quite realistic for FY2026)

\- Average revenue the last 3 quarters is \~$117,467 

\- Current partnerships span 15 brands across 5 different companies. 

\- Company received orders of over 700,000 pods in May alone from 3 customers, as well as a \~250,000 pod repeat order and a \~100,000 pod new purchase order in October, 2025

\- Q1 2026 shows positive gross margin for the first time ever (13.7%)

\- They need to significantly increase revenue to approach profitability

**Forward thoughts**

\- company is trading at a 50% discount to NAV (share price is $0.16-0.17, book value per share is $0.32)

\- they haven't issued additional shares since 2021 (aside from warrants and stock options being exercised but that's quite small)

\- revenue is finally climbing and should continue to

\- they will likely need to raise additional funds again before reaching profitability, but the revenue trajectory is encouraging

\- defaulting on a loan payment is concerning - given how much cash they apparently have on hand it doesn't make much sense, but if terms are re-negotiated it may not be a big issue

Is this a great company as it currently stands? Absolutely not. But should they be trading at a 50% NAV discount? I'd argue no. The company needs to string together a few strong quarters in a row for a significant spike in share price, but downside risk appears minimal. Between now and the release of the FY2026 financial statements there should be an increase in positive momentum and buying sentiment. Any meaningful press release related to revenue growth should drive the price up bit by bit. What are y'alls thoughts on this?",2,1762215893.0,NEXEInnovations,0,1.0,False

*Where the Grizzlies Are Missing More Than Just Players—They’re Missing a Playbook*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: The Math of Misery**  
The Detroit Pistons (-4.5, -192) are favored to stomp the Memphis Grizzlies (+160), who are missing four key contributors (Ty Jerome, Scotty Pippen Jr., Brandon Clarke, Zach Edey) and playing with the urgency of a sloth on a coffee break. Let’s crunch the numbers:

* **Pistons’ implied probability** of winning outright is 66.7% (from -192 moneyline).
* **Grizzlies’ implied probability** is a paltry 38.5% (+160), which feels about right for a team with a 25th-ranked net rating.
* The total is set at **236.5** (Over -115/Under -105), but with Detroit’s 7th-ranked defense and Memphis’ injury crisis, this game smells like an *Under* waiting to happen.

Cade Cunningham (20.1 PPG) and Jalen Duren (12.3 PPG, 8.1 REB) are the Pistons’ offensive engines, while their rebounding percentage (8th in NBA) will exploit Memphis’ absence of Edey and Clarke. Meanwhile, Ja Morant’s return (20.8 PPG, 6.7 AST) is a silver lining for the Grizzlies, but even Ja can’t outplay a team that’s missing its second-unit glue guys.

The Grizzlies’ recent drama reads like a *Saturday Night Live* cold open:

* **Ja Morant** is back from a one-game suspension after a postgame altercation with coach Tuomas Iisalo that would make a WWE referee blush. His return is crucial, but can he fix a roster that’s missing **four rotation players**? Probably not—this is basketball, not *Magic: The Gathering*.
* The Pistons, meanwhile, are healthy enough to field a team and actually have a functional bench. Their recent wins over Orlando and Dallas? More impressive than Memphis’ 3-4 start, which includes losses where they shot 45.6% but still looked lost.

We broke up in early July after a year and a half. About 4 months into our relationship, I began experiencing a deep depression and we both suffered through it. I tried multiple medications, quit my job, gained a decent amount of weight, and failed two classes. Several months into this depression, I became almost completely codependent on him and had basically moved into his apt with his two roommates. In the end, at some of my lowest, it became apparent that he could not help me and that I was severely hurting him. We broke up.

Since then, I've gone to a treatment (PHP) program, lost 20lbs at the gym, and am retaking my classes. In early September, I reached out and we got coffee. It went fantastic and we processed through a lot. Neither of us harbor bad feelings and we're both glad that the other is healthier. We've really reconnected - going to the gym together, I've spent the night at his house (he lives alone), and we're good friends. 

Thanks for bearing with me! Here are my two qualms:

1) He hasn't told his (and our, when we were together) friends. When we're out or on campus, he's constantly checking their locations and terrified we'll be seen. We - or I - call it the shame monster. It really feels like he's ashamed of me, and while I understand why he's entitled to privacy, it's been a long time. I'm being left out of things we would have gone to together back before the breakup and it really hurts my feelings. Over the past several days, he's decided that he wants to. But on the day he said he would, he most certainly did not (surprise surprise).

2) We're not back together and we're not talking about it. I try to engage conversations but he struggles to have hard talks (I blame his parents tbh) and we don't get anywhere. It truly makes me feel like I'm not enough, because we're basically dating, but no label. I want to preface that he's definitely not afraid of me regressing, but I still don't quite know why.

I'm wondering if I should wait for him to come through on either/both of these things. Or, do I leave and suffer the pain of another breakup? Any advice would be so so appreciated!",4,1762215692.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

(Voice included),"Hi, I’m 6’0"", a person of color, rocking the certified dad bod (no kids, just snacks), and still someone who believes in the beauty of true connection. I think love lives in the little things: laughing until it hurts, holding hands on late-night walks, or splitting dessert while pretending we’re “too full.”



About me:



Food is my love language. Cooking, trying new spots, or just indulging in comfort food all make me happy.



I’m a lover of stories: books, anime, games, and travel. Basically anything that lets me escape into a new world.



I collect physical media because Wi-Fi can fail but my Blu-rays won’t.



I’m laid-back, affectionate, a little goofy, and believe love should be both playful and meaningful.



What I’m hoping for:

Someone kind, thoughtful, and down to build something lasting. I imagine stargazing together, rainy afternoons curled up under a blanket, and mornings that start with coffee but somehow turn into adventures. Bonus points if you don’t mind my bad puns or will hype me up while I try to bake cookies that may or may not come out edible.



If this made you smile, tell me your favorite comfort food or share the last silly thing that made you laugh way too hard. Who knows, maybe it’s the first page of our story.

Has anyone been here?","Hey everyone, I’m looking for advice and thoughts. I feel like I’m stuck with my ADHD treatment and my psychiatrist doesn’t seem to know what to do anymore.

A bit of background:

* I’ve tried Dexamphetamine 5mg, 3 times a day. It didn’t work.
* Tried 15mg, 3 times a day. Doctor said it’s not safe.
* Then moved to Vyvanse 50mg, once a day. It doesn’t seem to work fully. I think 70mg might be needed. Sometimes, if I drink coffee mid-day while on 50mg, I can finally focus, which confuses me.
* Ritalin 10mg, 3 times a day. Doesn’t seem to work, sometimes makes me feel depressed.

The problem is: even when I have work I enjoy and the time to do it, I just can’t start. I sit at my computer, know exactly what I need to do, but get restless, bored, and have no desire to work. My brain just won’t let me focus.

I’ve read that some people’s doctors combine Vyvanse (higher dose) with Dex as a booster at different times of the day. Maybe that’s something I should explore?

I feel like my psychiatrist isn’t really questioning my experience or my ideas about what might help, and I don’t know what to do next.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice on how to approach a psychiatrist who seems stuck, or tips on medication strategies that worked for you?",2,1762215294.0,ausadhd,1,1.0,False

1onsmnt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1onsmnt,X-Mid 2 first pitch - repair question (I messed up),"Hey, after more than a year of thinking about it, I finally bought an X-Mid 2 and took it out on the Wicklow Way in Ireland (oldest long distance trail in the country)!

I love the tent, how it looks, how spacious it is (I came from a small 1 person tent) but I really messed up...

I woke up 10 mins before the sunrise and I realised that the tent doors are not facing the sunrise. I really wanted to enjoy the coffee and oats in my sleeping bag while looking at the sunrise so I unpegged the tent. I then rotated it 90 degrees and began putting in the pegs again. I put three of them in, walked to the other side of the then and realised that one of the trekking poles popped out of the reinforced section and punctured my fly. :(

It didn't cross my mind that this can happen, I think it's because in my last tent, the trekking poles were held in tension between the bottom and top parts of the inner tent so it was not possible for them to pop out. I was used to occasionally moving my tent without taking the poles out. Damn muscle memory.

I want to fix this and I would love for it to look as pristine as possible. I read Dan's great advice on the website on using a silicon based liquid adhesive. I found a website that sells it over here too: https://www.canoecentre.ie/products/seam-grip-sil-silicone-tent-sealant?srsltid=AfmBOortUKSxZIaWt7wLYBF-70spqKRrSoo3fZkTTtheu-6Ctb1Hs7rQ.

I have two questions about using it though:

* Is the liquid adhesive enough for this size of a hole? It is about 2 cm long along the small stitching
* Is the adhesive on the outside of the fly enough? I read that the silicon based adhesive will only stick to the outside of the tent, should I get another adhesive to also apply to the inside of the tent?

It’s hard to ask for advice without all the background of a long relationship, but I’ll focus on this one situation.

My partner’s couple friends were coming to my place for dinner and drinks before an event. Since my place is bigger and he bought the tickets, I offered to host and cook. He said he’d come three hours earlier than them, but as the day went on, he delayed multiple times and ended up arriving at the same time as his friends, three hours later than planned. He said he was feeling depressed (which he has struggled with for our entire relationship), so I didn’t push it, even though I was stressed and tired from doing everything alone. The night itself went very well and we had a lot of fun. 

The next morning, while I was cleaning up, he made himself coffee and grabbed some cake from the fridge but didn’t offer me any. I brought up gently that I felt hurt by those two moments: not showing up to help and not offering coffee. I said I just wanted to express how I felt.

He told me I shouldn’t bring things like that up, that I should assume he’s doing his best, and that he doesn’t mention things I do that bother him. Then he said that if he weren’t depressed, he could “do better than me” and that I make his life worse, which was confusing and painful, since days earlier he’d told me how lucky he feels to have me and the night before he was all over me.

This has happened before: when I try to talk about issues calmly, he often gets defensive or turns things around on me. He’s also called me selfish and “tit for tat,” even though I spend hours helping him with work and emotional struggles and rarely ask for help myself because I know he’s depressed. These situations usually end up with me apologizing and consoling him.

There’s more history, but that’s the gist of this issue.

Should I have just let it go and not brought it up? If so, how do I help him through his depression without losing myself?

1onsgj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1onsgj9/i_suck_at_this/,I suck at this,"I've worked in hospitality for about 3 years. I've always been above average, and was the only one who could do consistent latte art, handle high volume orders and was the main ""problem solver"" in my shop aside from the manager. I really enjoyed my job, but hated working for a franchise and always wanted to work in a high quality, independent coffee shop. About a year ago, I left hospitality but got burnt out and realized I wasn't suited for an office job. I decided to go back to what I was good at.

So, I went to an independent cafe recently. My trial shift went great, they were really impressed. I started last week and I'm easily the least knowledgeable, most clumsy, slowest and most consistently aggravating to my coworkers. I'm mostly working with a more experienced barista who openly dislikes me. (talks to coworkers in front of me and walks away when I  try to contribute, makes pointed comments, nitpicks and criticizes me constantly.) My standards are nowhere near my coworkers. I haven't had a shift yet where they haven't pulled me off bar because it's too busy to let me keep slowing them down. I clopened every day I worked last week, but still mess up the opening and the closing procedures. I was on the floor today and forgot to ring through an addition to an order, so it came out after the customer had already eaten. I told a table I'd bring down their bill, but got called off to carry food from the pass and forgot. Another coworker had to drop it off for me. I've had legit panic attacks on the bar from the volume of orders and the amount of drinks I've messed up. I've been told off by the owner for being too messy. I'm simply not up to standard.

Next year, I move away to pursue my degree. I'm only working here in the meantime, but I hate being so bad at it. I want to be good, and I want to help my coworkers and even help the business.

I am travelling over Xmas for 18 days. starting in kandy then jumping on the train to Ella on xmas day & there for a couple of nights before shooting through to Udawalawe for 1 night & sunrise safari trip. On to Hiri (5N)after that before jumping to Weligama/Mirissa for 3N then Ahangama for 6N to do that & Unuwatuna & Galle before making my way back to the airport.

Can anyone recommend a decent little homestay in Ella (or nearby), i am travelling on my own so wouldnt mind somewhere with other guests staying. ideally want to walk to the bridge in the AM for Sunrise & then the next morning do the same for Adams peak. Will probably do ella rock the same day as the bridge, also any good spots for views of the bridge would be great & any more recommendations for the island down on the south coast, Im a beach bum so wanted to spend majority of my time kicking back there & having a few beers/surfing.

Also is $150 AUD enough spending money for each day (few tuk-tuks, transfers, lunch, dinner, coffees, tours etc)

any help be much appreciated.

## The Unbeatable Benefits of Going Washable

Swapping a traditional rug for a washable one is one of the smartest upgrades you can make for your living room. Here’s why:

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=washable%20area%20rugs%20for%20living%20room)

*   **Ultimate Peace of Mind:** Kids, pets, and clumsy guests? No problem. A red wine spill or a muddy paw print is no longer a catastrophe. It's just a load of laundry. This freedom lets you actually *live* in your living room without constant anxiety.

*   **Incredible Convenience & Hygiene:** Forget scheduling appointments with professional cleaners. When your rug starts looking dull or has an odor, you just toss it in the wash. This deep-clean capability removes dust mites, pet dander, and allergens that a vacuum simply can't reach, leading to a healthier home environment.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=washable%20area%20rugs%20for%20living%20room)

*   **Budget-Friendly in the Long Run:** While the initial cost is comparable to a traditional rug, you'll save hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars over its lifetime on professional cleaning fees. Think of it as an investment in your sanity and your wallet.

*   **Effortless Style Updates:** Want to refresh your space for a new season? Many **washable living room rugs** are affordable enough to have a couple of options on hand. Swap a deep, cozy wool-like texture for winter with a light, breezy cotton flatweave for summer.

## Your Buying Guide: What to Look For in a Washable Rug

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=washable%20area%20rugs%20for%20living%20room)

Not all washable rugs are created equal. To ensure you get one that's both durable and stylish, keep these key factors in mind.

### ### Material Matters
The material dictates the rug's feel, durability, and how well it washes.
*   **Cotton:** The classic choice. It's soft, breathable, and gets even softer with each wash. Great for a casual, relaxed vibe.
*   **Chenille:** This is the superstar of softness. Chenille washable rugs are incredibly plush and comfortable underfoot, often mimicking the feel of a much more expensive, non-washable rug.
*   **Polyester/RPET:** These synthetic materials are masters at resisting stains and fading. They are incredibly durable and often made from recycled plastics, making them an eco-friendly option.

### ### Construction: Low-Pile is Your Best Friend
""Pile"" refers to the height of the rug fibers. For a rug that needs to fit in a standard washing machine and dry effectively, a low-pile or flatweave construction is essential. High-pile, shaggy rugs hold too much water and are prone to mildew.

### ### Non-Slip Backing: A Safety Essential
The best washable area rugs come with a durable, non-slip rubber or latex backing. This is a huge plus, as it means you don't need to buy a separate rug pad. It keeps the rug firmly in place, preventing slips and trips—especially crucial in a busy living room.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=washable%20area%20rugs%20for%20living%20room)

### ### Size and Shape
Measure your living room and furniture arrangement before you buy. A common rule of thumb is to have at least the front legs of your main furniture pieces (sofa, chairs) sitting on the rug to anchor the space and create a cohesive look.

## Caring For Your Washable Rug Like a Pro

To keep your rug looking its best for years to come, follow these simple steps:

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=washable%20area%20rugs%20for%20living%20room)

1.  **Spot Clean First:** For small spills, act quickly! Blot the area with a clean cloth and a mild stain remover.
2.  **Shake It Out:** Before washing, take the rug outside and give it a good shake to remove loose dirt and debris.
3.  **Follow the Label:** This is the most important rule. Most rugs are machine washable in cold water on a gentle cycle. Use a mild detergent—never bleach.
4.  **Dry Smart:** Air drying is the safest method. Hang it over a railing or lay it flat. If you must use a dryer, use the lowest heat setting possible. High heat can cause shrinkage or damage the backing.

> **Pro-Tip:** To keep your rug's fibers fluffy and prevent matting, give it a quick vacuuming (without the beater bar) once a week.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=washable%20area%20rugs%20for%20living%20room)

Just because it's practical doesn't mean it can't be a showstopper.
*   **Anchor Your Space:** Use a larger rug to unify your seating area. A well-placed rug can make a small living room feel bigger and more put-together.
*   **Play with Patterns:** A washable rug is a fantastic, low-commitment way to experiment with bold patterns like geometric designs, abstract prints, or traditional motifs.
*   **Layer Up:** Place a smaller, textured or patterned washable rug on top of a larger, neutral one (like a jute or sisal) to add depth and visual interest.

A: Absolutely! The technology has come a long way. While early versions were thin and utilitarian, modern rugs, especially those made from **chenille**, are incredibly plush, soft, and luxurious.

### ### Q: How often should I wash my living room rug?
A: It depends on your lifestyle! A good rule of thumb is a full wash every 2-3 months, with spot cleaning as needed. If you have pets or kids, you might find yourself washing it a bit more frequently.

*The only way forward is through caffeine*, thought Henry as he made his way to the galley.  His mind was racing through the growing list of all the items that he would have to decide on before he used that earpiece and went into whatever digital reality Shiva had constructed for himself.


While his mind was active, his body was letting him know that he really should be taking it easy after all the exertion, adrenaline, and endorphins that he'd been experiencing since the *last* time he'd used the odd technology to visit the God AI. That notwithstanding, he forced himself towards the galley.


As long as nothing physically broke or needed some on-the-fly modification, Sally could still manage most of the engineering needs while she stayed in medbay. And, of course, if it was really necessary, Henry knew that Sally would disconnect her tubes and do what needed to be done.  As he made his way through the hatch to the mess, he realized that he was really going to have to have a talk with her at some point about paying attention to her own physical wellbeing.

Wilson.  Wilson was going to be down for a while.  Sally *could* technically target and run the basics of the weapons’ station from her holoscreen, but not the way Wilson would.  And if they needed to use weapons, Vicki would be fully engaged with piloting.


His fingers fumbled over the controls of the drinks dispenser as he worried over the options he might be able to put in place if he got caught in Shiva’s world while trouble happened.  As dark liquid started to spit from the dispenser’s nozzle into his mug, he sighed.


“Vicki?  Got a minute?”  Henry’s tired words escaped his lips as he watched the level of the dark liquid grow ever closer to the lip of the mug.  His tired expression brightened ever so slightly as the smell of the coffee finally reached his nose.


“Of course, sir. What do you need?”  The AI’s voice in the air was a little softer than usual.


""Well..."" The Captain looked back down to his mug as the dispenser's trickle ceased, and reached for it.  ""I need to talk to Shiva again, and we're down crew.  If I'm out of commission, and you're running things under these circumstances, I'd like to hear your general plan.""


Vicki's response came after a short, but noticeable, delay.  ""Well sir, under normal circumstances, I would say that Vraks and I can navigate through these rocks, especially since Chilly is still keeping an eye on the deflectors from the medbay's workstation.""


As Henry brought the mug to his lips, blowing on the steaming liquid, the AI continued.  


""If something really troubling came up though, I would order Chilly back to the engineering bay, because that's where she'd head anyhow.  I could have Vraks run the sensors, as it's very familiar with our system and the console is already configured for it.  The dicey part for me is running the weapons systems.""


""So long as we're outside of the asteroid field, I can probably do the defensive work, and do the simple work of getting 'fish' in the tubes, but we both know that I'm just not a tactical sparkle.""  Vicki let out a digital sigh as her words trailed off.


Henry nodded and let out a quiet ""Heh,"" then shook his head.  ""No, but you're solid, Vicki, and your outline sounds as realistic as the situation allows.  Don't worry about not being a combat pilot.  The Sac isn't an intercept fighter; she was only really designed to use the weapons as deterrents so we could cut and run if trouble was encountered.""


Vicki's slightly musical chuckle filled the air of the galley.  ""Thanks, Captain.  I'll do the job that's in front of me, but I'm not delusional enough to think that I'll be racking up medals while I'm effectively in command.""


Henry chanced a sip of the coffee and found that the temperature was, thankfully, just below the tongue-burning level he was worried it would be.  As he felt the warm liquid start to flow through his core, he sighed.


After a breath, he nodded toward the ceiling.  ""If you were looking for medals, Vicki, I wouldn't even suggest you being in command.  So... Given that the medbay is already overcrowded, I'm going to lie down in my room for the contact with Shiva.  I'm going to prop the door open, and I'll grab a portable diagnostic unit from medbay, so you can keep an eye on me... My body anyhow.""


Henry continued, ""As of right now, I'm giving you command.  Your directive is to protect the Enola Gay, and need be, escort her back to CoW space.  How you deal with both of those is left to your discretion, so long as you do your best to hold to regulations.  Is that clear?""


""Aye, aye, Captain!""  Vicki's answer came quickly, followed by the more formal words, ""I hereby assume command of the TAV Sacagawea for the interim of your communications. Thank you, sir.""


Henry chuckled, as he headed towards the corridor, ""Vicki, you could have just logged that.  Don't splash, yeah?""


Vicki let out a quiet musical laugh, ""Yeah, well, you're about to risk frying your neurons, Henry, so I figured that we needed the grounding.  Go grab the medunit and let me know when you're crossing over, okay?""


""Copy that, Vicki. Thanks.""  Henry headed towards the medbay.



-=-=-=-=-=-



""Frag, Cap!  I thought Wilson looked like drek, but you looked fully wrung-out!""  Sally's words carried a tone of good-natured ribbing as he entered the medbay.


Before Henry could answer, a velvety, sultry female voice came from the air, ""Chief! That's no way to talk to a superior!""  Then, after a beat, it continued, ""Especially when I can't see him myself...""


Henry's face soured somewhat at Sally's laugh, but he couldn't hold it long.  ""Ugh, you're insufferable!  Give me a break, I'm about to go chat with Shiva again, and let me tell you, that's no picnic... Well, except for the virtual food...""


He looked up towards the ceiling, ""And I'm assuming that our comm-critic is Liz?  If so, I'm very pleased to meet you, ma'am.  Thanks for bringing our wayward boy back to us.""


Sally grinned and punched Henry's shoulder playfully, ""Hey, I'm the one who faced The Dark to go grab him, you know.""


Liz answered, ""Affirmative, Captain Miller.  And I am glad to meet you as well.  You've cultivated a good crew.  I'm looking forward to being a part of it.""


Henry grinned tiredly at Sally and nodded, ""Fair enough, Chilly, you're the hero, but I'm giving Liz the assist on this one, okay?""  He looked back up at the ceiling and continued, ""And I am very happy to welcome you aboard, Liz.  I'm sorry that we can't be more welcoming, but as long as you and Wilson are aboard, please know that we'll do our best to get you integrated with The Sac's systems, okay?""


Sally's white teeth showed against her darker skin as she smiled widely.  ""I'll take it, Cap.  And don't worry, Vicki and I are working on an interface for Liz, and it's going well.""


Liz's rich voice almost purred out her words, ""Oh, thank you, Captain.  I... I really do want to help.""


The Captain nodded to Sally and set his steaming mug down on the counter as he knelt down to rummage through a cabinet for the diagnostic unit. ""Good, Chilly, and make sure that you get her access to the archives, okay?  The way that everyone on the boat throws around references, she needs a good grounding... And Liz, I appreciate that.  Any help you can give will be welcome.""


Sally nodded, ""Aye, Cap.  And...""  She playfully reached for his mug, ""... can I just say how much I appreciate you bringing me caff...""


Henry triumphantly raised the diagnostic unit and closed the cabinet before he stood up and waved the unit defensively toward Sally's reaching hand.  ""Hey, you're off food for a few more hours, Chief Winters.  Keep your hands off my coffee!""


Sally laughed and pulled her hand back into a placating gesture.  ""Fine, fine.  I'll just suffer here as I work on the code...""


Henry grinned, ""Good, you do that.  Oh, officially, Vicki has the conn.  Play nice, okay?""


Sally nodded, ""Aye, Cap.  Good luck with the God...""


After Henry headed out of the medbay with his hands full of the diagnostic unit and his mug of coffee, Liz asked, ""Chief, what did the Captain mean about digital food?  And do I need to consume that now?""

1ons9ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ons9ib/1_coffee_54_days/,1 coffee. 54 days.,"I've been tasting a batch of Tim Wendelboe's Karogoto everyday now for 54 days. I know Dense Kenyan coffees can be tricky to fully extract. I wanted to see how it changed and became easier to discern notes as time went on. So I ran a short ""experiment.""  You typically have to run a fine line between CO2 release and the oxidation of oils. So I mitigated the effects of oxidation while allowing the aging and CO2 release to continue, by continuously displacing the air with nitrogen gas (N2). The N2, being inert and more dense than O2, surrounds the coffee in the bag creating a barrier against oxidation while still allowing CO2 release.
After 54 days of resting using this method, I found the profile changed significantly from my initial tasting. The sharp acidity first present between days 0 and 20 (and that sometimes vegetal/tomato note) had balanced out. Between days 20-30 the coffee came out as very floral and almost herbaceous. I'd assumed the coffee was at peak around day 32, still presenting very floral and high acidity almost tart, but I still had half a kilo left to drink. Continuing to drink it until today, day 54, and it seems like this coffee hit a new wave of flavor. It is suddenly in complete harmony with itself and is super sweet and like ripe plum with the florals caring the finish like a sweet hibiscus tea.

 I thought I'd share the parameters that are working for me with this particular coffee.

Coffee: Tim Wendelboe Karogoto (54 days off roast)
Grind: Coarse (6 on Fellow Ode Gen 2)
Dose: 15g
Water: 240g total (1:16 ratio)
Water Comp: 1/3 strength Third Wave Water @ 195°F (90.5°C), temperature maintained
Kettle Flow Rate: ~6g/sec (direct pours)

Pour Structure:
0:00 - First bloom of 45g.
0:45 - Second bloom of 45g (for a total of 90g).
2:00 - Final, direct center pour up to 240g.
TBT: 3:30 - 3:40

Analysis & Tasting Notes: My theory is that the double bloom is necessary to fully saturate and extract these dense beans at a lower temperature, while the coarser grind prevents any stalling during the final direct pour. I got a sweet black currant note, ripe plum, and hibiscus. The cup was perfectly balanced, not overwhelming, and had absolutely no trace of the tomato flavor I'd gotten from prior, fresher brews.

I'm curious if anyone else has had similar success using a double-bloom technique on aged, dense coffees like this.

Scrolling through dating apps makes it worse somehow. Is it the lack of matches? The dwindled conversations? Or the fact that people only seem to like to travel, drink coffee, eat pizza or go to the gym?

It's the familiar feeling. There doesn't seem to be anyone for me. 

The more insidious question that I try to keep at bay: what do I lack? Why aren't I chosen?",3,1762213931.0,Vent,3,1.0,False

Sonic was done fighting Eggman (the end of Sonic 1) and used the chaos emeralds to fix everything that Eggman did... meanwhile in a village (Idfk where tails was form so fuck it I'm making this free style) a 2 tailed fox was alone.. looking at his dead parents that he killed the knife in his hand leaking a bit of blood as the fox named miles prower was tired and slowly losing his mind but he was able to manage As he cleaned up and walked out of his home not remembering about what he did.. as 2 other foxes (his bullies) walked over with smugg looks ""hey freak! What happened? You look like someone just pissed in your house"", ""yeah! Freak but whatever your still weak to even think"" both other foxes remark before beating up miles but miles let it happen.. after all he was a freak right...? Later that day miles went back home as cops were there while investigating the incident of miles parents as miles was stopped by an officer ""hey kid..."" the officer mumbled ""a 2 tailed fox. Ew"" the officer explains to miles what happened to his family as miles just looks more... done with life (tired) ""oh.... i see... where do I life now..?"" Miles asked ""well we don't know there aren't any orphanage close by until a few days away.. so we'll let you stay at this home"" the officer said as miles sighs... time skip a few weeks Miles was alone talking to himself, eating any food left as he was sitting on the couch as he hears a sound from the door and walks over and opens it to see the land lord ""hey kid where's your mom or dad"" the owner of the house said sounding mad, ""they're died..."" miles replied ""I see... well I asked for your family because the rent on this house is due for the last week"" miles sighs as he didn't have any money or currency ""well tough luck kid.. get out"" miles walks to his small room and takes his stuff slowly as he sees the knife he used to kill his family and remembers... there wasn't a murder.. he was the murder miles realizes this as he hears a voice ""you know... you could just kill the owner of the house and make it yours"" miles looks around seeing no one as he picks up the knife as he hears more voices as he remembers how it felt to kill his own family... it felt powerful like he had something for once.. miles stops and walks to the door where the owner was still holding the bloody knife ""oh took you long enough-"" miles stabs the owner in the heart as he kept stabbing as the owner screams as miles kept stabbing until there was no screams as he slows down on the stabbing.. miles felt powerful for once... he looks down at the bloody and dead body of the owner blood spilling everywhere, he's heart exposed and rips broken miles drags the body inside as he drops it into the bathtub and cleans any blood remains as miles hears the voices cheer for him as he felt.. useful for once ""I-is... this right..?"" Miles asked to himself as he continued cleaning the mess and goes to sleep in his sleep miles relive the moment he killed his mother.. his father, and the owner as he felt happy ripping out there flesh and bones slowly hearing there screams, later miles would wake up feeling happy, miles got up and held the knife still the blood remains on there as he walked into the kitchen.. but there wasn't Any food left, miles was hungry and considered eating the dead body but shakes it off ""that would taste gross..."" miles hides the knife against his fur as he walks out as he was close to his breaking point, ""HEY FREAK!"" Miles felt a sharp pain against his back as he turns around and sees his bullies and he runs as he make it to Greenhill at a darken corner ""heh you really thought you could get away?"" One of the bullies remarked as they start walking to miles but miles stares at them.. he had enough miles pulls out the knife and jumps to the main bully stabbing the hell out of his lungs as the other bully states in horror and fear as miles rips off flesh and starts eating it not giving a care because he has been starving for over a week ""y-you..."" the other bully states ""S-SOMEONE!-"" he didn't get to finish his words as miles kills him too.. meanwhile.... sonic was running around happy he saved the day as he hears a loud scream ""huh? What the"" sonic runs over and jumps down and stops breathing seeing the scene before him.. a two tailed fox was ripping out bones and flesh while eating some of the flesh the guts and bones were covering the small area ""W-what the.."" sonic muttered as the two tailed fox stops eating and looks at sonic with the knife he used... both stared at one another

knowing a friend:

Sonic stares at the 2 tailed fox who had blood dripping out of his mouth from the dead body's ""you.."" sonic felt a strong urge as he dodges a knife swipe that probably would've cut off his head. Sonic looks down at his arm for a moment blood was leaking out and the 2 tailed fox stares at him with more madness, sonic kept dodging not wanting to hurt the kid but he knows he has to sonic waits until the fox slows down as he gets behide him and knocks him out the knife clattering to the floor... ""huff... geez for a kid he sure has a lot of energy"" sonic mutters to no one in particular as he drags the kid away from the scene and the knife too... Miles/tails pov: I stared at the blue hedgehog.. he looked scared, but didn't quiver even a moment.. I found it interesting. I could still feel the taste of their flesh but I know I needed to kill the hedgehog before he would run and tell someone the hedgehog was going to say something but all I heard ""you"" coming from him but I rushed in without a waste of a moment as I try to stab him but failed but at least stabbed a hole into his arm, I kept slashing and chasing after him he was surprisingly fast.. after awhile I was getting tired.. more then ever then in felt a sharp pain in the back of my head as everything slowly went black... no ones pov: sonic makes it to his workshop as he puts the 2 tailed fox down on a couch with strains, sonic sighs as he walks into a back room and cleans the blood and wound from the knife ""geez.. if I didn't dodged that I would've been dead"" sonic muddera in credulously as he bandages himself and calls a certain echidna... knuckles pov (and I said it before sonic met knuckles sooner in this timeline though they aren't best buds but friends in the end): I was just on angel island guarding the master as usual I was.. surprising bored until I heard my phone ring as I pulled it out and saw it was sonic and I thought to myself 'what could that hedgehog need now?' He thought in his mind. As he picks up ""hello sonic..."", ""hey knuckles can I asked you a question?"" I didn't reply as sonic kept talking ""so.. hypothetically if I kidnap a kid who tired to murder me and ate other mobian's what would you do?"" I stopped processing what the fuck sonic just said ""excuse me... but what the fuck did you just asked me?"" I could hear sonic choke on his own air, typical ""okay knuckles let's say hypothetically I kidnapped a kid and he was a murder and a cannibal what would you do?"" I sigh as I rub my head as I know sonic has to have committed another felony ""sonic... did you kidnap a kid?"" I could hear sonic breathing as he I can tell the next words he was gonna say were a lie ""n-no knuckles come on buddy.. I would never kidnap a kid-"" ""cut the lies sonic I can tell your lying to me.."" sonic sighs over the phone ""okay fine I did kidnap a kid but i couldn't let him alone he might kill someone again"" I sigh as I was slowly getting an aneurism ""sonic.. just ugh... make sure you don't die and my advice is to see if the kid is even savable anyways I have to go back to making sure the master save"" I hung up as I go back to my duty... Sonic's pov: I sigh as knuckles hung up as I walked out of the bathroom and see the kid out of his restraint somehow and staring at my plane (the tornado), I stared at the kid as he wasn't looking at me as I quietly get closer but failed miserably, the kid snapped his neck to face me as I didn't move an inch until I was grabbed and being choked by the fox ""h-hey..."" I coughed out as he kept choking me while staring into my eyes ""where is my knife..."" I weakly point to the back room as he drops me and runs towards the back room as I coughed 'geez... this kid even weak and malnourished still has a lot of strength' I thought to myself as I see the kid walk out of the back room holding the knife again as he looked... calmer.. ""hey kid... what's your name?"" I asked as he stared at me Miles/tails pov: I stare at the hedgehog as he asked me for my name... I didn't want to be miles... ""tails.. that's my name hedgehog..""

side part:

Many weeks later sonic was able to MOSTLY keep ""tails"" in check, though ofc sometimes sonic would look away and see tails chewing an innocent person and one day he left to get a new phone and at the worst time, a certain echidna had to visit... Knuckles pov: I have been worried about sonic for the past week he hasn't picked up his phone... ""damnit i'ma go visit him"" I use the master emerald teleport to his workshop as I walked in I saw a yellow 2 tailed fox who tense up, I hold my hands up as in a way to show that I'm not here to try to hurt him ""hey kid... have you seen a blue hedgehog...?"" I asked as I start to remember the call From 2 weeks ago about sonic (hypothetical)question ""oh... so your the kid that sonic kidnapped?"" I instinctively dodged to the right as a knife worlpassed where I was standing, I get in my normal fighting position as the kid starts to attack me rapidly as I was surprised that the kid had a lot of speed, Tails pov: I was staring at a red echidna that walked in he asked about sonic.. I dislike him already... ""oh wait your the kid sonic kidnapped..?"" I hiss as I thrown my knife at him as the echidna dodges... I WANTED him DIED for him to think that I was kidnapped.. I start rushing at him but he block perfect though I couldn't care as I eventually just kicked him right in the testicles as the echidna drops the floor ""AGHH... YOU BITCH-"" I start snapping his bones as I enjoyed myself... knuckles pov: I was getting tired but I kept fighting knowing this kid is a fucking lunatic but I wasn't expecting the kid to hit me right the testicles.. I felt so weak.. but I didn't give up yet, but he snapped my legs.. my arms.. all I could do was not scream, so the kid couldn't get any satisfaction.... I just hope sonic could be here soon... no one's pov.... later that day sonic walks into the workshop and stops seeing tails with knuckles severed arm in his mouth ""tails..."" ""sonic...."", ""tails where's the body...?"" Tails points to the back room as sonic walks in to see knuckles bloody, broken bones in a corner and with a severed arm, sonic sighs as he drags knuckles into the main room as sonic sees tails tensing up again ""tails don't hurt him anymore.. he's a friend of mine..."" tails stops almost immediately as he sighs and spits out the arm he was chewing... meanwhile in a lab/base a certain moustache man was watching everything though cameras ""OHOHO that hedgehog has a new friend? That attacks others? He could be useful for my world domination plans... issue is he looks very unstable.. whatever my future plans shall continue anyways... not like it matters.."" later in life Eggman would regret not killing the fox sooner, but at the moment Eggman gets up from the camera room and walks over to his newest creation... ""metal sonic... you shall be the key to my world domination.."" Eggman hits a button as the chamber said two days left before he can finally use his greatest creation... Eggman laughs with pure madness his hatred for that hedgehog growing more and more... eggman hears his signals go crazy as he walks over and stares at some stones... ""time stones eh? Sounds very powerful... if I can get my hands on those I defeat that hedgehog easily.. though it's on little planet... i'm over 3000 miles away from there.. whatever.. BADNIKS Start making a base at Little planet pronto"" the badniks leave as Eggman sighs while grabbing coffee And plots every way to murder sonic... back with the main characters lol sonic pov: ""and that how I meet knuckles"" I said proudly until I look at my right and see tails fucking asleep while drooling and to my left knuckles is watching some Minecraft fucking video and snoring, I bang my head against the wall as I sob to myself and sleep on the cold the couch... the next morning I got up and heard about Eggman's plan after he tried to sneak attack me again.. as I walk to my tracker and input everything ""little planet huh..? Welp I gota save the day"" I run off forgetting about tails...
Tails pov: I wake up as I slightly remembered about sonic yapping about something knuckles.. I look around and see no one... no Knuckles or sonic as I stare at a computer monitor... ""little planet.. time stones..."" I saw that the tornado was still here.. I grabbed the keys and fly towards little planet to find and help sonic.. and maybe murder... no one pov: thus this takes us to the events of sonic CD ALSO Bonus: earlier that morning sonic helps knuckles and drop him off at angel Island as knuckles heals himself with the master emerald and now has ptsd from tails and dislikes him, tails is canonically unlicense but still using a fucking plane-, sonic is slowly losing his emotions and more depressed, Eggman is slowly losing his mind just wanting to end that hedgehog..

events of cd:

tails jumps into the tornado as he flys remembering how sonic taught him he flys all the way to little planet as before he could think of where to land he gets hit in the head by a pink gem (phantom Ruby) ""what the fuc-"" tails gets teleported as he crashes into the floor of a burning angel Island... ""..."" tails stares at a old looking sonic with an X on his stomach as he was playing chess with a dead looking version of himself ""weird.."" tails walks around trying to find the fucking pink gem as he hears a small sound of a theme as he turns around and sees the old ass sonic fly towards him as tails waits as he kicks the shit out of the old sonic and runs off knowing from that one kick that thing isn't killable... yet as he gets cut off by the old wrinkly sonic as tails get slapped the shit out of him as he crashed into a hill and sees the pink gem as he grabs it and get teleported away.... lord X pov: I slapped that damn fox as he teleports away.. it irritate me to no end but I just sigh as I walk away about to get back to my chess game until I felt my back give out on me ""shit... I'm too old for this I need a cane"". Meanwhile with sonic, sonic runs past a past sign as he goes back in time and breaks another one of Eggman's badniks generators as he runs it the end and sees Eggman in... a robot with 2 legs that look unstable and 2 arms that had pinballs on them ""Eggman.. what is this?"" ""HOHOHOH SONIC BE READY FOR THIS I MADE IT JUST FOR YOU GET READY TO DI-"" Eggman gets hit by the tornado that crashes right into him as Eggman flys off burnt using his jet pack, sonic sighs as he looks around and sees tails appearing out of a pink portal with a pink gem... meanwhile tails hops out of the portal as he sees the tornado crash into a fat bald man as tails throws away the pink gem as he decide to act like Meeting that other sonic never happened (it will be reference later on) tails jumps down of a cliff and lands on the floor as he sees sonic ""tails why are you here? I told you not to come here..."" ""sonic we both know I would follow you either way and the tornado was an accident... also who was that bald fat guy?"" Sonic sighs as he explains Eggman.. ""Ok... anyways can I join you for this?"" Sonic sighs because he knows tails would not leave him alone and if he says no tails would stab the shit out of him ""fine just promise me you will not slaughter anyone"" ""no promises sonic..."" sonic and tails run by Collision Chaos zone act 1 as sonic sighs as he hears HER again ""SONICCCCC"" tails snaps his neck at the sound with his knife but stops as he stares at a smaller hedgehog that was pink as sonic jumps onto a cliff as the spikes that were in the way break by a metallic thing... a sonic tails and sonic stare at the metal version of sonic as he flys off kidnapping the pink hedgehog ""so... sonic who the hell was that?"" ""Amy rosy (or rose Idfk) she's a fortuneteller and for some reason is infatuated with me.."" ""sounds like a pain..."" ""it is anyways let's get going"" they past by past signs as tails stares at the past as he stabs a few poor badniks as he gets blood on him as sonic grabs him by the scruff of his neck (and yes this tails has scruff at the back of his neck) as they broke the badnik generator as they went back into the future as they past the act and made it to act 3 as tails and sonic stare at a hole ""this doesn't seem like a good way to go... maybe we could-"" tails kicks sonic into the hole as he jumps in as they start bouncing all over the place because of the stupid bounce balls (or whatever the hell they are called) as Eggman drops spike balls as tails just lands and flys up to Eggman and rip out the injector reader of his machine as he trys to fly out but Eggman couldn't ""shit NOT THIS TIME"" Eggman self-destruct the small machine as he flys out and uses his jet pack until tails jumps him as Eggman slaps tails off and gets stabbed as Eggman runs off, sonic climbs out of the bouncy hell hole ""tails stop trying to murder"" tails shrugs as he runs past the sign as sonic joins as they made it to idle Tempest (or something) sonic looks down sweating a bit ""um... t-tails there's too much water maybe we should-"" tails pushes sonic as he sinks in seconds ""...hedgehog..."" tails goes in and helps sonic get past the entire stage and got a time stone... in the next zone of Quartz Quadrant Zone sonic crashes into another wall as tails walks stabbing any badnik that sonic didn't hit as tails and sonic both got a time stone, at the next zone Wacky Workbench Zone- tails grabs sonic and flys over everyone ""no"", stardust runaway zone, sonic would have 5 out of the 7 time stones as he sees the metal man himself metal sonic tails just flys over them as Eggman flys in with a death laser as tails lands on him as both sonic and metal sonic race through stardust runaway zone act 3, Eggman trys throwing tails off of him but tails kept scratching him and eventually knocks the doctor out as he crashes onto the floor as tails runs towards the sonic's as both turn around in two seconds and see tails as sonic speeds up and so does metal as tacos catches up as sonic makes it to the end as tails rips off metal sonic's head ""geez watch out next time tails you could've killed me.."" tails stares at sonic with a bored look ""right....."" sonic turns around and sees Amy with a brown fox (a reference to my one of my friends on discord) sonic points at tails giving him an indication as sonic speeds by as tails frees Amy as she runs towards the sign as tails sighs as he goes too, Metallic Insanity Zone the last one. Sonic jumps over and makes it past the crushing pillar as tails flys over and get shot by the min bee boss thing afterwards Eggman appears in a... robot that strangely looks like a hexagon ""come on Eggman this is your best final weapon???"" ""Yes it is hedgehog now I'll be ready to face the wrath of my final weapon-"" tails throws his knife at it as it breaks off some of its apppens and stabs Eggman around the leg ""NO-"" Amy walks in as sonic grabs her and tails and runs off as base explodes as sonic lands back into Mobius/earth as little planet crashes downwards and explodes thankfully, no one died (a reference to another creepy pasta) a Eggman was on a flying scooter as he laughs having the last time stone as sonic throws a fucking rock and makes it explode as he catches the last time stone.. sonic runs off as tails stares at Amy as tails runs as Amy follows sonic for awhile until later he walks into the workshop as he sees tails waiting for him on the couch with a bag of chips, sonic sits as he still has the time stones and hides them away for now....

bonus... Eggman would crash onto emerald Hills zone as he sees a new chance to conquer at least this island And kill that damn hedgehog, Eggman grabs metal sonic's leftover body and leaves as he starts his plans but someone was watching in the background ""this is intriguing... this timeline is different yet the same story but I know it would last long..."" the man in black watching in the background before he leaves....

We have been friends for over 12 years now and he’s like a brother to me. Important to the story is he’s gay. Since moving in he’s brought over three different men, which I’m fine with but he’s brought these strangers into our apartment even after I said no. I have a cat and he’s not a fan of strange men. The last guy he brought over stayed the night and left early in the morning and that night when I went to cook dinner was missing some seasonings (I know that sounds crazy for someone to steal but it was Missing and every guy my friend has brought over or ive met has been weird af). This time he brought over a guy and Saturday morning I found him with a guy in his room, turns out he stayed the night and he never told me (we said we’d tell each other about bringing people over to give a heads up) and it’s now Monday and this guy is still there. He’s been eating my food and drinking my coffee, he’s not a rude guy and I have nothing against him but he’s still at the apartment and I don’t want to have to watch my back because some stranger is staying here! I texted my roommate asking when he’d leave and he never gave me an answer besides saying we needed to talk when I get home from work (which I’m writing from right now). His words “I also want to talk to you whenever your home or can, nothing bad but just want to talk to you about something” and when I asked if he just wanted to call me he replied with “I’d rather talk to you in person about rather than over the phone if that’s okay” I’m very irritated and if this guy doesn’t leave by tomorrow morning (he works at 7am and I won’t go into work until 1pm) I’m thinking of calling the cops to get this stranger out of the apartment.

Dad! I watched a commercial about a video game and I want it!”, “oh? What game might that be?”, “sonic the hedgehog!”, Robert stops as he remembers about that game as he nods, “sure kido i’ll take you in like an hour or so when the game is actually out”, Alan left and hopped onto his old laptop and watched videos until he saw a website advertised, about a optical Sega Genesis as it said free on it as Alan being a kid and wanting to play sonic he immediately remembered the address of his own home and put it in as the thing asked one question… “do you want to be my FRIEND?”, Alan stared at the screen as he didn’t know what to do so he just clicked yes to not be mean as the website said predicament day at night at 1am, Alan was happy as later that day his dad would take him to a store and they would just buy sonic the hedgehog, but not the console but Alan remember the website thing as he just had to wait at night, within that night Alan walked out of his bedroom and wait at the front door for almost an hour, as he heard a knock as Alan opens the door and looks down and sees a box… as he picks it up and goes inside closing the door behind him, Alan made his way to his room and closed the door and opened the box… inside of it was a Sega Genesis but it’s colour was a different shade then the original ones his friends were talking about but he just thought he could’ve gotten lucky and gotten a newest version just for himself, Alan plugged it in and put the cartridge inside as he turns on his mini tv and sees the title screen, Alan started playing hill zone act?, Alan we’re sure he thought that it was Greenhill zone act1, then again he forgets a lot of things (mostly), Alan plays as the blue hedgehog on screen moves around with his controls until the game makes a loud sound before fading into a black screen, the words of “Do you remember me?”, two options appeared ‘yes’ or ‘no’, Alan tries to remember desperately as he couldn’t as he clicked on no, “aw… what a shame how about I jog your memory?”, the tv cracks as Alan backs away until a glove hand came out out of the TV and grabbed him by his face in a second and all Alan felt… was a sharp pain before everything went black, the next morning Robert went into his son’s room and sees his kid (Alan) dead on the floor his neck snapped a full 180, Robert quickly calls the police as the cops arrive to see a crying dad holding his kids body and a broken TV in the same room as they took the body away as they took Robert for an interrogation, “so tell me what happened yesterday or today that could’ve caused this to happen, Mr Robert”, “m-my son was alive… heathly and well, I took him to go get sonic the hedgehog yesterday but I never got the console”, the officer stops, “wait that could be a clue. There’s a console in the room where you were in sir”, the officers quickly get up and examine the console, after a long while the only trace the officers can find is a white glove that looked way too small for an adult… years have past as Robert got sonic 2 as he played it… knowing his son would have loved it as Robert turns off the console for the night and sleeps,

Meanwhile…. Alan wakes up his head hurting and neck itchy as he gets up and stands his legs wobbly as he looks around, he sees a lot of green things, water and a clear sky as it reminded him of sonic the hedgehog, as he gets up and looks down and jumps, his body was of yellow fur and he had 2 tails which he thought was pretty cool as he made his way into zone……

I LOVE TAG”, “get a head start fox”, Alan realizes he’s in a body of a fox. But it didn’t bother him as he started to run as he heard static and everything became quiet as he hears “TIMES UP”, as he runs faster Alan takes a look behind him and sees the sonic slowly catching up to him until he felt a needle stab him in the leg as he trips over crying a bit as the sonic appears right in front of him grabbing Alan’s (tails) and slowly start to pull on his lower and upper half, “A-AH S-STOP-“, Alan felt an excruciating pain after his body was split in half as everything one black once more, Alan? Wakes up feeling a bit lost as he could barely remember anything, Alan gets up And feels a sense of pain through him, he started to cry and scratch his neck feeling aburning itch until an entire hand, comes out of he’s throat and snaps his neck and wants more leaving him in darkness, “your my FRIEND now we will always play my game, every single day you wake up”, the next day Robert gets up and turns on the Sega Genesis to play sonic 2 until he stops and watches how tails is getting choked out by his own best friend sonic until the hedgehog opens his mouth as a fucking tentacle comes out and stabs the tails as he hears screams from the poor fox as it slowly decays into dust, as the screen turns black for a moment before saying, “your not meant to be here… Robert..”, and the screen switches to an anti-pirates screen, as Robert did not hesitate and immediately called the police, meanwhile tails (Alan’s soul), falls onto the floor as he feels his head hurting as he got up wondering how many times has he died? To the point he can’t even remember who he is, tails walks into scrap brain zone and walks until he felt the floor under him break and he screams feeling his body painfully and slowly withered away in a black substance, years have past as tails has dead over 8981 times his body always being regenerated back, tails always tries desperately to win a game and to escape, but he always fails anyways, he fell to the floor as the sonic grabs him by the neck and pulls his lower half “W-WAIT”, the hedgehog stops giving him a moment to speak, “y-you said w-we were f-friends, w-why are you d-doing this to m-me?”, tails asked staring into the sonic’s eyeless sockets, “it’s quite simple ‘tails’ you agreed to be my friend yet you didn’t know the consequences and that’s not my issue but yours”, and less then a moment tails neck was snapped but after his flesh was tear off,

Act 2, Dave/knuckles

in the year of 1994 sonic3&knuckles comes out as a kid named Dave would buy the game and run back home to play the game, when he got home he put in the cartridges and the title screen appeared but something was off the sonic in the title screen wasn’t moving at all. Just staring at him until the tv breaks and grabs him before snapping his head as he wakes up later in the body of knuckles as he gets up and looks around and saw tails running like hell as he jumps down and hits assailant following him it was sonic? No it couldn’t be… he looked way too different Dave (knuckles) stands his ground just to get pulled into the ground the dirt burying him as he couldn’t breathe while hearing laughter as Dave slowly loses his conscious he just hoped he wasted enough time to let tails to run away but deep down he knows that he didn’t do shit but delaying the inevitable, meanwhile tails was running faster his legs starting to hurt until he heard a car as he turns around just got get ran over by a truck as he dies for the 8903 time, as knuckles(Dave) comes back alive on angel Island as he sees a car crash into the tails as he walks away trying to remember, where is the master emerald, hidden Palace… knuckles got up and ran towards the direction as Sonic(ONE MORE GAME), watched with an amused look while chewing tails head, as he throws away the head and flys off, knuckles made his way though hidden palace, avoiding any of the traps and needles on the floor or roof as he walks towards the master emerald until he gets grabbed and slammed into the ground while ‘sonic’ was laughing while holding the master emerald and throwing it up and down like a rock, “how funny do you really think this over sized pebble can save you?”,knuckles got up and trys to punch him but ‘sonic’ caught it before ripping off his arm “how pathetic…”, he grabs knuckles with his arms coming out of the floor choking him painfully to death and ripping his flesh, “your just like Alan so much fun yet such a failure”,

Act 3, Isaiahn/Eggman but for my own sanity his called Ivo,

Isaiahn was dying as he desperately fights off the hand coming out of his TV but he fails and dies anyways, He wakes up feeling buff as hell as he looks down and saw he’s appearance, DOCTER Eggman, Ivo(Isaiahn), gets up and checks the cameras in front of him and sees tails(Alan), and knuckles(Dave) both dead as he got up and runs deeper into the base as he sees ‘sonic’ coming towards him as Ivo quickly, moved behind and runs back where he came from before jumping into the death egg robot, which ‘sonic’ didn’t waste time and started to attack thigh it didn’t taje long after a few minutes later ‘sonic’ got bored and broke the death egg robot as Ivo falls out and trys to run but he’s legs get ripped off as he falls and ‘sonic’ walks towards him as Ivo closes his eyes until metal sonic(Izumi), rushes in hitting ‘sonic’ away, “Doctor quit being a little bitch and get up”, Ivo gets up “Damn alright let’s get the the hell out of here”, both Ivo and metal sonic left as soon as they could as ‘sonic’ got up and less then a second Ivo felt his back snap as his crumples to the floor, “fuck… metal sonic get the hell out of here immediately and that’s an order and turn on self protocol”, Ivo yelled as metal flys off as he was grabbed and was ripped in half as ‘sonic’ stares at the flying away metal sonic, “you can run, fly, do whatever but in the end it will all end the same… Hahahah… HAHAHAHA… AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH”

1onryat,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesOfDustAndCode/comments/1onryat/the_quiet_days_of_chief_bill_harmon/,The Quiet Days of Chief Bill Harmon,"Harmon had been the Chief of Police in Dartmoth for twenty-two years, which was twenty-one years longer than anyone in town thought the job really required. Dartmoth wasn’t the sort of place that needed a Chief of Police, at least not in the usual sense. Most of the crimes committed there were of the domestic or culinary variety—Mr. Franks forgetting to pay for his coffee again at Lila’s Diner, or old man Riggs making moonshine that everyone pretended not to know about, but somehow always ended up in the punch at town events.

The Dartmoth Police Department—grand name, modest building—sat between the post office and a bakery that doubled as the town’s social nerve center. The building had two desks, three uniforms, and one perpetually broken coffee maker. Harmon’s desk was a battlefield of papers, reports, and old receipts that he swore he’d get to someday. He hated paperwork more than just about anything, and it seemed to multiply overnight like rabbits.

There were only two deputies. Deputy Grift, who’d been around longer than the chief himself, had an unfortunate gift for attracting trouble from farm animals. His patrol car had been rammed by a goat, chased by an ostrich, and once had a raccoon riding shotgun for a full hour before anyone noticed.

The other deputy was Fred M.—the “M” added only to keep him separate from Fred R., who ran the gas station and had absolutely no business being mistaken for an officer of the law. Every Halloween, the two Freds would dress as identical twins, even though one was bald and built like a fire hydrant, and the other was tall and thin with a thick red beard. It had become a town tradition to pretend they looked exactly alike.

Then there was Mabel, the dispatcher. She was in her sixties but acted like she’d retired twenty years ago. Her voice crackled over the old police radio like a ghost from another century. Mabel had two defining qualities: she could talk endlessly about anything, and she never let an officer go hungry. On cold nights, there was always a pot of stew or a casserole waiting at the station—though it was sometimes unclear who had volunteered her to do that.

Finally, there was Harmon’s secretary, Miss Crowley, the oldest woman in Dartmoth and possibly in the tri-county area. She could barely hear, had no sense of urgency, and insisted on typing every report on a typewriter that predated color television. But she was loyal, and Bill had long since given up trying to modernize her.

It was, by any measure, a peaceful life.

That morning, like every other morning, Bill Harmon was at his usual spot—the corner booth at Lila’s Tavern, the only place in town that served breakfast strong enough to make him forget the paperwork waiting back at his desk. Lila herself ran the place like a benevolent dictator. Nobody ordered; she just told you what you were having, and everyone accepted it because Lila was always right.

Bill was halfway through a plate of eggs and sausage when his radio crackled to life.

“Hey Bill, I think I have a two-eleven Sierra in progress. Can you hear me there, Bill?”

Mabel’s voice came through loud and unsure, like she was trying out police codes she’d just learned five minutes ago.

Bill sighed, wiped his mouth with a napkin, and pressed the mic.  
  
“Hey, Mabel. I understand what a two-eleven is, but what the hell is a Sierra?”

“Hell, I don’t know,” Mabel said cheerfully. “I was just reading about it. I think it means ‘silent.’ Did you know that in some places they use different numbers? I could never remember all those numbers. I think they should just say what they mean. I mean, who came up with—”

Bill clicked the radio off before she could finish the sentence. Mabel’s lectures could last longer than church sermons.

He tossed some bills on the table, nodded to Lila, and stepped outside. The air was crisp, the kind of cold that hinted winter was creeping closer. The bank was kitty-corner across the street, and nothing about it looked remotely like a robbery in progress. The front door was open, the teller was yawning, and old Mrs. Partridge was inside arguing about her balance like she did every week.

Then he spotted the real culprit—Fred R.’s dog, Cooper, squatting proudly in Miss Brooks’ flowerbed across the street. Miss Brooks, of course, was standing on her porch pretending to be scandalized, though Bill was sure she’d made the call herself.

He crossed the street, tipping his hat.  
“Morning, Miss Brooks,” he said. “You wouldn’t happen to know anything about a bank robbery, would you?”

Her hands flew to her chest in mock offense. “Well, I just saw suspicious activity, Chief! That animal has been terrorizing my marigolds for weeks.”

“Your marigolds are plastic, Miss Brooks.”

“Well, that’s beside the point!”

Bill squatted down to look at Cooper, who was now wagging his tail like this was all a game. “You’re gonna get me fired one of these days, you know that?” he muttered.

Miss Brooks sniffed. “If you’d enforce the law, Chief, this town would have some order.”

“Ma’am,” Bill said, straightening up, “the last time someone tried enforcing order around here, we had a riot over pie judging at the county fair.”

She narrowed her eyes but said nothing. Bill smiled, tipped his hat again, and wandered back toward the tavern.

Back at the station, Mabel was waiting with a fresh pot of coffee and an unnecessary amount of excitement.

“So what was it? A real one this time?” she asked, sliding him a cup.

“Yeah,” Bill said dryly. “Caught the perp red-handed. Four legs, wagging tail.”

Mabel laughed, her dentures clicking. “Well, I suppose that’s better than the alien invasion last month.”

Bill groaned. “Don’t remind me.”

That “invasion” had been a single glowing drone that a teenager had flown over the mill pond after dark. Half the town called in UFO sightings before the poor kid came forward. Dartmoth had always been imaginative that way.

He sat down at his desk, stared at the mountain of paperwork, and sighed. Every arrest, every citation, and even every dog complaint required a form. He’d once tried to go paperless, but Miss Crowley had refused. “Computers forget things,” she’d told him flatly. “Paper remembers.”

As if summoned by his thoughts, she appeared in the doorway. “You got your monthly report due, Chief,” she said, sliding a stack of forms as thick as a Bible onto his desk. “Also, I made cookies.”

He blinked. “Cookies?”

“They’re lemon,” she said, as if that explained everything, and left.

The rest of the day unfolded as quietly as most in Dartmoth did. Grift reported that the Jenkins’ cow was blocking the main road again, Fred M. stopped by to brag about fixing a flat in under ten minutes, and Mabel managed to patch her phone call through to the wrong Fred twice.

By sunset, Bill was sitting on the station porch, sipping coffee that had gone cold hours ago. The town lay still before him—streetlights flickering to life, the soft hum of conversation drifting from Lila’s Tavern, and the distant sound of a dog barking somewhere out past the mill.

He leaned back, smiling to himself. Dartmoth wasn’t perfect. The people could be nosy, the problems ridiculous, and the paperwork endless. But it was his kind of place—quiet, stubbornly ordinary, and full of heart.

Tomorrow there’d be another “emergency,” maybe a cat stuck on a fence or a scarecrow mistaken for a prowler. He’d grumble, fill out the reports, and know deep down that he wouldn’t trade it for anything.

Because in Dartmoth, even the false alarms kept the town alive.

And if the worst thing that happened on his watch was a fake robbery and a dog with bad aim—well, that was just fine by Chief Bill Harmon.",1,1762213196.0,TalesOfDustAndCode,0,1.0,False

1onrs9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeerotation/comments/1onrs9v/help_me_save_rotation_drop_viable_solutions/,Help me save Rotation. Drop viable solutions.,"Rotation Financial Overview (Last 6 Months)

Rotation has operated at roughly a $12,000 loss over the past six months, driven purely by shipping and fulfillment costs.

This figure does not include any hard costs such as scales, packaging materials, or labor (before third-party logistics). It also excludes the 3000 tubes of 30g tubes produced to date.

So, looking strictly at coffee subscription economics, here’s the breakdown and key takeaways:

⸻

Key Takeaways

	1.	Initial Founder Pack Losses
I lost money upfront with all the early founder sign-ups. Each received pulsar brewers and the deep 27drop, which allowed me to order in larger volumes and attract participation from top roasters.
This strategy created brand credibility and supply chain access but at a significant initial cost.

	2.	High Coffee Cost Structure
The coffees selected were extremely high-end.
	•	Average cost: $10 per 50g, overshooting targets by $2 per bag.
	•	A few beans were secured under $5, but most were packed directly by roasters, increasing production costs.
	•	Some roasters only offered 100g minimums, pushing costs up to $11–$12 per unit just to keep inventory flowing.

	3.	In-House Fulfillment Thesis
The economics don’t work when relying on roasters to handle packing. It’s slow, hard to coordinate, etc.
My clear thesis now: all packaging and fulfillment must move in-house to reach sustainable margins but would require space, employees, etc.

	4.	A La Carte Model Weakness
The “a la carte” offering underperformed.
While I personally enjoy curating high-end, experimental, BOP, and COE coffees, most customers didn’t buy them.
	•	~80% of buyers only purchased coffees priced below $6–$7 per pack.

	5.	Market Saturation at the Top
Another issue: most roasters eventually source the same premium lots within a 1–2 month window. Once you start from the top tier, true variety becomes scarce, limiting differentiation.

6. Wasted Inventory & Freshness Limitations
Unsold beans became a significant loss factor. Since Rotation focuses on fresh, small-lot specialty coffees, there’s no way to store leftover beans without compromising quality. Once the freshness window closes, the product is effectively wasted translating to direct sunk cost on premium inventory. I personally will still drink light roasted coffee past 3 months, with rested maybe 6+ months out. But most people prefer to drink within 3 weeks.

“Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.” — Genesis 28:16



Dear Grace,
I pen these thoughts as I once did prayers—slowly, with trembling faith. Outside, a cacophony of shrieking metal and upturned earth announces the latest desecration of the soil—an expansion of the local highway leading into the concrete sprawl of downtown. It feels almost symbolic: progress devouring peace, commerce paving over contemplation.

I miss home! My captivity here in the North has been dreadful. In the seven years that I have languished here, I have yet to find edible cornbread. Don't even get me started on what they serve as sausage gravy. I could really go for a hot brown to make my wistful spirit tolerable. Anything from home would be a salve upon my soul.

Anyway, I was a mere lad when a crisis of faith befell me. Naturally, it would have to be something pretty traumatic given my history growing up in the church — Southern Methodist on my momma’s side, and Roman Catholic on my father's. 

My faith back then was sturdier than Sisyphus’s boulder—unyielding, unquestioned, and destined to roll. Every day found us beneath a steeple’s shadow: choir or handbell practice, a youth group function, Bible study, or a weekly potluck dinner. Faith was not something I believed in; it was the air I breathed. 

“Trent, get up. We need to talk. It’s about your brother.”

His voice was brittle—like old timber in a storm. My father, usually the picture of stoic Southern resolve, stood in the moonlight looking hollowed out. It was the second time I’d ever seen him cry—the first was at his baptism, when the Spirit broke him open like clay. Now it was something darker that filled him.

I was raised up to be more stoic and sturdier like him - or like sorghum cane in the fields just south of my parents' home back in Kentucky. Even if planted within wet soil on a windy day, I was raised up to be resolute, even when my childhood dog had to be put down rather than suffer the impediment of old age. If ever I wanted to shed a tear, it was in that cruel moment saying goodbye to my best friend and fishing buddy. 

No, not even then did I cry — not even when the tempest met the storm. His actions and conduct defined a southern man’s actual worth, which is why I struggled to grasp the weight of the moment.

“What time is it, Dad?”

“It's early still. Come to the kitchen when you are dressed.” 
His words were tinged with foreboding and disassociated calm. In the moonlight, his eyes were worn and glazed. His voice, usually robust and melodic, was monotone and wavering. Even the cherry blossom tree in the yard genuflected with melancholy within the looming light. 

A fierce breeze flushed from the open window as I quickly dressed; the breath of Autumn’s being. We had celebrated the win from a band competition just hours prior, so my thoughts were still love-drunk and heady, having spent time with my new girlfriend. 

Things with Jordan were different from my typical type of girl. Beneath the facade of gentle grace and soft manners, past the polite smile and soft-spoken drawl, lay a steel-magnolia-like character of great strength and subtle determination. 
She displayed a fierce loyalty to her family and heritage through a rapacious intellect and unwavering passion. 

She was beautiful—
not in a loud or ostentatious way, but in that gentle, quiet, approachable way, like a spring morning rising over bluegrass-laden hills, adorned with flecks of aster, goldenrod, and coneflower within the heartland of my beloved South.

Gentle, yet familiar— like the lyrics of a cherished ballad, intimate and inviting, like a first kiss stolen after a homecoming dance beneath a paling, starlit sky. Yes, Jordan made a first impression meant to linger— to be savored. She lingered like aged bourbon on the tongue — warm, heady, impossible to forget. 

Or that tender, irrevocable moment of bringing home your first pet together. Within her lay the better parts of Southern living — refined indulgences tempered by toiling in the field and farm for daily sustenance. She was nearly perfect, as far as I could tell. So why did I kiss Trish at the band competition?!

“I’m here, Dad.. Now what is going on?”

He didn't speak for a prolonged beat — a haunting moment personified by a Miles Davis trumpet solo where the absence of sound resonated as profoundly as his smoky-laden notes. Instead of responding, Dad just sat there on the wooden bench before the circular wooden kitchen table, holding and caressing Monma’s hand. 

Momma bowed her head in contemplated disbelief and despair as my father cleared his throat to speak. Over by the stove stood our pastor, gaunt and age-worn. His glasses were struggling to stay upon his nose as he, too, remained silent.

“Trent, your brother had an accident. He fell while out hiking a rugged trail with friends. The fall broke his spine in two places. He’s paralyzed, son. The doctors are unsure if he will make it. Your mom and I are flying out in the morning to be with him.”

“In England? We can't afford that!” I exclaimed, the trembling of my voice mirroring the trembling in my extremities as the bitter reality of the moment set in. It had the distinctive taste of sucking on pennies.

“He is in Wales on holiday, hence the hiking excursion. It's about two hours west of his place in London. And the church is kindly assisting with the trip. Listen, son, we don't know how long we will be there, but anticipate being gone for a few weeks.”

Momma began to cry unabashedly. My father’s haunting words hit like a passage from Revelations. The pastor shifted his weight and moved to her side, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. Thoughts betrayed me in that moment. 

“Where are we going to stay? And what about school?”

Without a second’s thought, he confided, “It's going to be ok. Arrangements have already been made for you and your sister. Your brother is old enough to stay here by himself. He’s pretty self-sufficient.” 

The fear in his eyes betrayed his outward calm demeanor. The vacant gaze, forever fighting back tears of possibly having to one day soon bury one of his own children. He cleared his throat before continuing. The refrigerator hummed, the only thing steady in the room.

“You two will stay with friends from church for a couple of days, and then with your best friend’s family for the remainder of the time that we are gone. They insisted.”

Grace, it was terribly disconcerting to my young soul. All I could think about for days was of my broken brother clinging to life in a Godless country. 

Now, before you say anything, I know that England is not a godless country. They are a rather devout people with a religious tradition that seeps into their marrow. But how was I to know that as an impressionable sixteen-year-old with only the collective world wisdom as drawn from my rural Appalachian heritage and what I saw on television? 

That night marked the first crack in the altar of my belief, Grace. God had always been my compass—until I saw His silence take shape in my father’s eyes. Reflecting back, I wouldn't define my father as religiously devout, but he made an earnest attempt at it by attending weekly mass and going to confession at least twice a month. 

When the opportunity availed itself, he would assume some of the lesser, more charitable and administrative-based duties of a deacon, having been a seminary student for two years in his youth. He was never ordained, however. His heart just wasn't in it. “Too many lingering questions...” he’d confess to me one night after bedtime prayers. 

Weeks went by, Grace, with little moments of progress gently woven together. Both momma and dad put on brave faces in our nightly phone calls, but you could tell that this ordeal had stolen something palpable from their souls. 

It was nice staying with Dave and his family — an extended sleepover but without the GI Joe toys and comic books from our formative years. We used to have such fun, didn't we, Grace? Simpler times they were. I miss that. 

The weeks away from home weren't all bad. Jordan was leaving for a weekend trip back home to Magoffin County to be baptized in her family’s church. She graciously invited me to come with her and her family. I was surprised as hell when my parents agreed to let me take the two-hour trip south. 

It was the perfect time to steal away some alone time together over a meal at the Farmhouse Diner. Our budding relationship wasn't without its issues. Jordan’s ex moved two hours north to regain her affections. He was always around, or it was the running theme in our courtship. 

He was like Jay Gatsby’s character in The Great Gatsby — on an obsessive quest, doing whatever it took to win back his beloved Daisy Buchanan. No, this weekend was going to start a new chapter for us. No Scott, no throes with a wayward God over my brother’s broken body and vanquished dreams. Just us in the heart of Appalachia.

The trip was peaceful enough — a stark contrast to the suffocating weight that I was under. Try as I did to deflect my spiritual angst and anguish, the image of an unmoored johnboat violently moving through the cresting river as we drove past offered a visual manifestation of my predicament. 

I could finally see through the mask of my own doing. I gripped my chest as the morning fog encompassed the remnant images of the Licking River. It was hollow and dismayed. I paused, taking Jordan’s hand in mine as I whispered to the great unknown, “God is dead.” And then for the very first time, I wept.

We finally arrived at her old family home. It was a sleepy, rural town with one, maybe two stoplights to account for. The city was adorned with stone-hewn churches, their old-timey religious architecture, and scenic views of lush forests overlooking the Licking River. 

It was a quaint place whose history is deeply rooted in farming, logging, and coal mining, giving it a rural, hard-working character forged by fire and faith — toiling the land and reflecting upon the larger questions about life. 

I was enraptured by its quiet, uncompromising simplicity and reverence for its past as found in its historic village. For a town of just under 2,000 people back in the early 1990s, such a historical village would have been a point of pride and a valuable resource for genealogy and historical research. 

It was all reminiscent of a scene out of Thornton Wilder’s Our Town — the everytown, Grover’s Corner, based on the sweat, tears, and faith tilling the land of its limestone, clay, and everyday dust. 

Yes, Grace, a man could settle down and make a prosperous life for himself and his family in this milieu. If things had gone right with Jordan, I was starting to envision a life together in a place like this, especially after the conversation that night. Yes.. If things had gone right.

After a couple of hours conversing with Jordan’s mother, Sheila, and her sister Carrie, over some warm hot chocolate, Jordan and I stowed away our gear in her old bedroom. Boy band posters adorned the walls while soccer trophies and academic award plaques filled in the spaces on her old pinewood desk. 

“This is cozy. Seems like you did well here. Was it challenging for you to relocate to a new city and attend a new school? Sorry, I never got around to asking.”

Jordan plopped down in the center of her bed as she had done countless times before. The mattress immediately embraced her — holding remnant creases and folds within its form, reflecting memories of sleepovers and boy talk, late-night study sessions, and listless hours waiting for that special someone to call.

“Yes, it had its challenges.. she sighed. “But it wasn't all bad.” With that, she looked up, immediately making eye contact before flashing that endearing smile of hers. “You wanna get out of here?”

Fascinated by the life she had left behind, I idly traced the statue atop one of her soccer trophies with my fingertip before responding. “Sure, what did you have in mind?”

A half hour later, the bell over the door of the Farmhouse Diner gave a tinny jingle as we slipped inside, the sound swallowed by the low hum of conversation and the sizzle from the open kitchen. 

It was past the supper rush. A handful of regulars nursing their coffee and a thick slice of Derby pie lingered. The air was thick with the comforting scents of frying onions, strong coffee, and decades of diner cooking.

With a contented smile on my face, I watched as Jordan slid into a cracked, red vinyl booth in the back, away from the fluorescent glare of the main counter, shrugging out of her denim jacket to reveal a faded flannel shirt underneath. 

“God, I thought we'd never get out of there,"" she said, running a hand through her thick, blonde hair.

I squeezed her hand across the Formica table. ""Me neither. Your mom wanted to talk about your baptism plans for another hour."" I grinned. 

“But at least she made us some hot chocolate."" The promise of a quiet meal had felt impossible all week. It was comforting to return to familiar habits.

A waitress with a faded beehive and a nametag that read ""Brenda"" slapped two menus down and poured us coffee from a heavy glass pot. 

“Evening. Who's this pretty thing you got with you tonight?"" she asked, with a playful wink.

""This is Jordan,"" I responded proudly, as if presenting a rare find. ""My girlfriend.""

Brenda smiled warmly. ""Well, nice to meet you, honey. Can I get you two anything else? The pork chops are fresh.""

Jordan smiled back. ""Just coffee for now, thanks.""

Brenda bustled off, leaving us alone in the booth. A country song from a local radio station played quietly from a tinny speaker, a fiddle weeping in the background. The low light from a nearby window caught the dust motes dancing in the air.

""So be honest, Trent, how was your day?"" Jordan asked, tracing the worn pattern on the tabletop with her finger.

""Long, but worth it,"" I replied, my hand finding hers. ""I just... I'm so tired of feeling like I'm doing what I'm supposed to regarding my brother. I just need time to process. Honestly, Jordan, I just want to be here in this moment with you.""

Jordan’s thumb stroked the back of my hand. ""I know."" A truck rumbled by outside, rattling the windowpane. ""It feels like we never get a minute to ourselves anymore.""

“Yeah.. so I was thinking,"" I began, my voice dropping. ""Remember that old gravel road we found near the river on our way here?”

“The one where we almost got the truck stuck?"" Jordan laughed, remembering the muddy fiasco.

""Yeah. What if we just... went out there? Ya know, tomorrow—just you and me. No distractions, no family. Just... a blanket and some sandwiches. And maybe a boombox, for some tunes.""

Jordan’s face lit up, and she leaned forward, her eyes bright with mischief. ""What, like an actual date?""

""Yeah. An actual date. We'll be back before your mom and sister notice that we are gone."" I whispered, a conspiratorial glint in my eye.

A hush fell between us, but it was a comfortable one. It was the kind of quiet that only two people who truly understood each other could share. The diner's noises—the clatter of silverware, the murmur of distant voices—all faded into a distant hum. 

Our little booth had become our own private world, suspended in time. For a moment, the world made sense again. It was a blessed distraction, even though it was just for a moment of serenity.

""So, what kind of sandwiches?"" Jordan finally asked, a smile spreading across her face.

I felt my gaze softening as I gently squeezed her hand, feeling the calluses on my own, the by-product of a day's hard work. ""How about... whatever we want. For once.""

The radio behind the counter was tuned to a classic country station, and a Hank Williams Jr. track about good whiskey and coming home boomed softly over the hiss of a deep fryer. Jordan slid her hand across the Formica tabletop to meet mine, and I squeezed it gently. 

Her jeans were high-waisted and slightly frayed at the cuffs, and the sleeves of her faded flannel shirt were pushed up to her elbows. The scent of sizzling onions and fresh coffee still hung thick and comforting in the air.

""I know that things haven't been ideal for us, but you've hung in there, and I appreciate that about you,"" Jordan said, thumb tracing the lines on the back of my hand.

I nodded, leaning back against the cracked upholstery. My shoulders were still tight from the trip. ""I’m trying, Jordan, but this is definitely outside my wheelhouse."" I reflected while catching the eye of our waitress as I held up two fingers. Brenda gave a slow, knowing nod, already heading for the coffee pot.

Jordan smiled. ""At least we get to eat some food that doesn't have dirt on it.""

""Speak for yourself,"" I chuckled, glancing out the window at the setting sun that bled orange and purple over the Appalachian hills. Parked outside, her stepdad’s old OBS Chevy truck with its peeling paint sat waiting, a reliable workhorse covered in a fine layer of dust.

Brenda returned, refilling our thick ceramic mugs with hot, black coffee. ""Y'all look tired,"" she said with a friendly Kentucky lilt. ""Got a couple of burger platters comin' right up.""

""Thank you, Brenda,"" Jordan replied warmly.

""Anything for you two?"" she said, patting Jordan's shoulder lightly before turning back toward the kitchen.

We drank our coffee, enjoying the silence and the simple pleasure of being together. Jordan blew on the steaming liquid, the soft warmth rising to her face. She looked up at me, a serious look on her face.

""So what are you going to do once you get back home from Dave’s place?"" she inquired.

“I haven't thought that far ahead just yet. I have basically just been taking it one day at a time,"" I sighed, noticing the way her eyebrows furrowed.

""I know that God feels a million miles away right now, but you are in my prayers. I am here for you, babe,"" she said quietly.

My hand stiffened in hers. Her heartfelt sentiment didn't fall on deaf ears, but talk of prayer was the last thing I needed at that moment.

“You don't know how much that means to me, baby,"" I said, trying to keep the frustration out of my voice. ""I know that you care.""

""I know, but you know you are a part of my family now,"" Jordan said gently. ""I just don't want anything messing things up for us. You and me... this is what we need. This right here."" She squeezed my hand again, reassuringly, her thumb stroking warmly.

I looked from her earnest, beautiful face back to the hills outside, their silhouette darkening against the last of the light. I thought instantly of Trish and that ill-begotten kiss. I have to tell her, I thought, if we’re going to have a future together.

It was all so simple and so important. Trish could mess it all up, but for now, in this moment, nothing else mattered. I lamented as an older couple across the way bowed their heads as the chicken and dumpling specials were set before them. They prayed like breathing — effortless, unforced. For a moment, I envied them that peace.

Meanwhile, our plates of cheeseburgers, crispy onion rings, and a small side salad arrived. ""You all just take your time, now,"" Brenda said, placing the plates down with a practiced hand.

""Thanks, Brenda,"" Jordan said, letting go of my hand. She picked up her utensils, exclaiming, “This looks so good. I’m starving.”

Taking a long, satisfying bite of my burger, I tried to deflect my guilt, Grace, even for but a moment in time. Savoring the salty meat and sweet onion, I dug in for more. 

It was just a meal at a nondescript diner, but with Jordan beside me, talking about our future, guarding our fragile time together, it felt like a king's banquet. We had each other. That was enough for now.

Dawn broke over Magoffin County like the lifting of a veil. The hills hummed a low hymn beneath the waking mist, and even the cicadas seemed to pray. Sunday had arrived—the day of Jordan’s baptism.

The church gathered at the river, where sycamores stood in long vigil. Men rolled their sleeves; women loosened their laughter. A deacon tested the current with his palm as if checking a fever. Hymns rose plain and low—Shall we gather at the river—a question and an answer braided into one, and the Licking ran on, indifferent and merciful in the same breath.

Jordan stepped down the muddy bank, dress hem darkening, hair pinned back like a vow. The preacher’s hand found the small of her back, and his voice turned gentle thunder. 

“Buried with Him in baptism,” he said, and the water received her without argument. For a heartbeat, she vanished, and the river held its counsel; I waited for a tremor in the air to undo the knot in my chest. Only a breeze moved—cool, workaday, honest as creek-stone.

When she rose, water gleamed on her lashes like a second anointing. “Amen,” the congregation answered—a sound that felt like home. What I felt was not belief but belonging: the land breathing, the hills keeping time, the river refusing no one. 

God did not answer me with a trumpet, Grace. He responded with ordinary mercy—the kind that smells of wet earth and cedar, the kind that says, I was here before your questions, and I will be here after.

We reached the church fifteen minutes later. Jordan changed, and we slipped into a half-empty pew near the back. After an altar call to mend the failing air conditioner, Sunday bests reached for worn billfolds and soft purses. Fifties and hundreds made a quiet, improbable river of their own. Many could scarcely afford it; still, they gave.

I remained empty. I wanted a theophany I could taste, touch, hold against the cruelty of nature and the breaking of my brother’s body. How do I praise benevolence with a mouth full of ashes?

Estne hoc tibi ludus pravus?! … Iacobusne an Iob? Ulcera in animo meo putrescunt! Frater meus iacet moriens, et tu manes tacitus.

(Is this a perverse game? Who am I before You—Jacob or Job? Boils fester on my spirit. My brother lies dying, and you remain silent.)

Am I not the pale reflection of my brother? Oh God, where is your Metatron, your bat kol, your Gabriel?

“Haec credam a deo pio, a deo iusto, a deo scito? Cruciatus in crucem. Tuus in terra servus, nuntius fui. Officium perfeci. Cruciatus in crucem. Eas in crucem.”

(Am I to believe that these are the actions of a righteous God, a just God, a wise God? To hell with your punishments. I was your servant on earth, your messenger; I did my duty. To hell with your punishments. And to hell with you!)


Four years of Catholic Latin prepared me to curse God in His own tongue, I reflected, a rain-soaked breeze threading the rafters, as a preparatory hush fell as seven men took the pulpit—pastors, deacons, citizens in good standing. No bulletin, no script: only the Spirit and a band tucked into the corner. They began with a burst, an ocean of sound—percussion and bass, a startled horn, guitar like flint—Coltrane’s Ascension, a composed musical work in the traditional sense but more of a raw, ecstatic outpouring of spirit, a sonic parallel to an unencumbered worship about to unfold. I ruminated while glancing over at Jordan.

Voices rose into glossolalia and hallelujahs; solos flared and yielded to the whole; testimonies leaped like sparks across dry tinder. An endless litany of Shelah, Shabach, and Halal rang forth like a mighty shofar. A series of solo improvisations, interspersed with full-ensemble sections, mirrored the impromptu sermons and testimonies that arose organically from the congregation around us. Jordan sat there interred in her faith and reasoned thoughts, sacred and complete.

Harmony refused to settle. One preacher’s wail braided into another’s Scripture; handclaps laid a dense foundation; somewhere a grandmother’s alto stitched sorrow to joy. Then, as if the room learned to breathe together, the storm gentled to a soft thrum—quiet intensity, heads bowed, the human heart returning to common time.

An unseen force moved the musicians, like congregants, all engaged in a ""collective act of love,"" a shared experience that transcended the individual ego. The sheer volume and intensity set a tone of unbridled passion and a shared spiritual quest — an acid trip with biblical resonance. The musicality enmeshed in the raucous cries of celebration was a living, breathing cacophony of discord and fervor, striving, yet failing, to construct the spiritual scaffolding of a harmonious whole, as if guided by Coltrane’s very essence. 

God was not in the notes alone but in the tension between them—sound meeting silence, chaos consenting to order. Yet all of it held in one accord. Jordan’s damp hair clung to her temple; she nudged my arm and smiled, her fingers finding mine. For a moment, everything felt right. I have her, and she has me.

I did not find God in Magoffin County, Grace—
I simply found where I’d left Him. “Too many lingering questions...”

After two days of intense meetings, networking, and many productive conversations in Lugano, one thing became clear: the world is finally starting to grasp the potential of stablecoins—something that, just a year ago, still sparked astonishment. Presenting what we're doing in Brazil, connecting stablecoins to the traditional financial system, drew attention not only for the innovation but also for the transaction volume we've already achieved today.

At the same event in 2024, I had said that 2025 would be the year when all fintechs, governments, regulators, and major banks would talk about stablecoins. And that's exactly what happened. The topic dominated panels, discussions, and informal coffees. Of course, there's still a long road of regulatory understanding ahead, but it's encouraging to see the evolution and progress of ideas that bring cryptocurrency use closer to the mainstream.

A new perspective on incentives and network structures

One of the most interesting moments was the conversation with Adam Back from Blockstream, the team behind the Liquid Network. We discussed the importance of rethinking certain outdated habits—especially the view that participating in a blockchain network only makes sense if there's direct financial return.

I believe the greatest incentive for maintaining a node should be keeping the network alive, functional, private, and secure. That's what guarantees freedom and trust for users. Adam agreed: a network's sustainability lies in its collective purpose. Liquid already demonstrates this with rock-bottom transaction fees, but there's still room to evolve—especially when it comes to microtransactions and inclusion in emerging countries.

And that's where discussions arose about new blockchains, like Plasma, which already proposes a model of free transactions for stablecoins. After all, if we want inclusion, the greatest incentive we can offer is simple: allow anyone to transact at zero cost. The second part of that incentive is showing that financial freedom is possible and accessible.

Tools that open new doors

Another major advancement is the Wallet Developer Kit (WDK) announced by Tether, which will enable companies and institutions to create their own self-custodial or custodial wallets with seamless integration. This should accelerate the building of bridges between the traditional financial system and the crypto universe, expanding the technology's global reach.

It was also inspiring to see Naka's work, a fintech that presented a concept very close to what we've already demonstrated in Lugano: a self-custodial card with Visa technology. The user signs the transaction only at the moment they tap the card on the POS, ensuring security and convenience. This kind of innovation shows that the future of digital payments is already being tested, and the technology is ready to move beyond mere talk.

Lugano, blue skies, and the harbinger of a new cycle

This time, Lugano welcomed us with two days of clear skies and a drone show that symbolized the city's spirit: a place where innovation is celebrated with art and purpose. As part of Rezolve AI now, we were able to give a small preview of what's to come in 2026—a year that promises to solidify what we've been building: inclusion, interoperability, and global financial freedom.",8,1762212308.0,RZLV,4,1.0,False

It’s been a long week.
My wife took a trip upstate to visit her parents, and I stayed behind for work. It wasn’t supposed to be a big deal, just a few quiet nights at home with our daughter.

She caught something two days after her mom left. Just a little fever at first, nothing serious. Kids get bugs all the time, right? I told my wife not to worry. I had it under control.

The thing is, the fever never really went away.

It’ll break for a few hours, she’ll seem fine, and then it comes back even hotter. She’s been too tired to get out of bed for more than a few minutes at a time. I’ve been camped out on the couch with the baby monitor next to me so I can hear if she wakes up in the middle of the night.

The monitor’s old, one of those bulky ones. The speaker hums from the white noise machine we keep in her room. I keep it on even when I don’t need to, maybe because the sound makes the house feel less empty.

The first time I heard her whisper, I thought she was calling for water.
It was past midnight. I remember the way her voice crackled through the speaker, tired.

“Daddy…”

I went to her room, but she was fast asleep.
Her lips were dry. Her hair was stuck to her forehead.
I almost woke her to check her temperature, but she looked peaceful for once. So I just stood there, watching her sleep for a moment, and went back to the couch.

I told myself I imagined it. Probably the monitor catching some old feedback, or maybe just my mind replaying her voice from earlier. It has been an exhausting few days for the both of us so that wasn’t out of the question.

That night continued without anymore interruptions.

The next night is when things took a turn for the worse. 

I had put her down to sleep around 8:00 pm. She was run down and exhausted. Body aches, fever, and a headache. I had been giving her medicine throughout the day and it seemed to only have a slight impact on her. In my mind the only thing that was going to help was rest and lots of it. 

She was asleep not 5 minutes after I put her in the crib. My nightly routine didn’t change. I grabbed the pillows and blankets from my bed and headed to the couch to be closer to her room in case she needed me. I plugged the baby monitor in and began to drift off to sleep.

I shot up. My daughter was yelling for me.

“Daddy! Come get me!”

“I’m coming baby!” I yelled loud enough for her to hear.

I made my way down the hallway to her bedroom. I swung the door open. Only to find her sleeping. Motionless. I stood there confused. I couldn’t have imagined this again. I stepped into the room. Only the sound of her soft breathing and the white noise machine. I stepped closer to her crib. There she was sleeping, not moving, not coughing, nothing. I didn’t want to wake her but I was shaken. This was weird, scary if I’m being honest. I heard her calling me. I know I did. This wasn’t exhaustion.

I returned to the living room, confused and worried. Was she talking in her sleep? Was she just seeing if I was nearby? I wasn’t sure of what was going on but I was starting to get worried. I felt fine but maybe I was getting sick. I did feel a little warm but had no other symptoms. 

I swear just as I was drifting off to sleep. 

“Daddy, I don’t feel good.”

I didn’t answer, I just ran, straight to her room. Nearly ripping the door off the hinges as I opened it.

Sleeping. She was sleeping. I couldn’t believe it. She had to be talking in her sleep. Maybe her fever had gotten worse. I stepped closer, this time determined to figure out what was going on. I reached into her crib to feel her forehead.

I recoiled the moment my hand touched her. Intense heat radiated from her forehead. My hand hurt. In awe I looked at my palm. A burn mark. 

My daughter was producing enough heat to burn my hand.


Part 2
_____________________________________

My daughter needed to go to the hospital. She needed help, more than I can provide.

I grabbed a few towels and rushed back to her room. I scooped her up and brought her to the car. I drove faster than I should but I needed to get her there.

I ran through the emergency room doors and straight to the check in counter.

“Help me please! My daughter she’s burning up!” 

I explained the situation the best I could. The worry on my face mixed with the details of the situation must have struck a chord with the nurses because they escorted us to a room right away. I placed my daughter on the bed. Through all of this chaos she was still asleep. After asking a few more questions and connecting an IV the nurse left and told me the doctor would be in as soon as possible.

I grabbed a chair and sat right next to her bed. She began to move and stir awake. 

A scream louder than I ever heard erupted from my daughter. Her back arched and vocal cords began to fry. 

I jumped to my feet. My ears were ringing from the volume of the scream. I could have sworn they began to bleed.

“BABY! BABY! WHATS HAPPENING! TELL DADDY!”

The scream continued.

I ran into the hallway searching for a doctor, a nurse, anyone that could help. No one nearby. I rounded the corner and saw a nurse behind a desk.

“HELP ME PLEASE! MY DAUGHTER, SHES SCREAMING! SOMETHING IS WRONG!”

The nurse paged for a doctor to my daughter’s room and followed me back.

When we walked in there was my daughter. 

Asleep.

The nurse walked to her bedside. And felt her forehead. She said she was warm to the touch but not extraordinarily hot.

My daughter’s eyes began to flutter open.

“Daddy? Where are we?”

Tears began to well in my eyes. “We are at the hospital honey. Something is wrong and these nice nurses and doctors are going to help us.”

The doctor came in about fifteen minutes later, clipboard in hand and calm in that practiced, detached way that only doctors can manage.
He asked questions, ran through the motions. Bloodwork, vitals, a scan.

When it was all done, he smiled.
“Good news. Everything looks perfectly normal.”

I stared at him. “Normal? Her temperature was through the roof. She was screaming, you didn’t hear it?”

He shook his head. “She’s stable now. Fevers can spike and drop rapidly in children, especially if they’re fighting something off.”

I wanted to believe him, but the words didn’t make sense. I held up my hand.
“Then how do you explain this?”

He leaned in.
There was nothing there.

No redness. No blister. No mark at all.

My voice cracked. “It burned me. I swear to God.”
He gave me that polite, cautious look. The kind that says we’ve seen this before.

I felt weak. My legs began to shake. I was going to pass out. The doctor grabbed a chair and told me to have a seat. They brought me water and did their best to calm me. It didn’t work at first but eventually I regained the little strength I had left.

They discharged us a few hours later.

The drive home was silent except for the hum of the tires on wet pavement.
Every so often, I glanced at her in the rearview mirror. She was asleep again, face calm, breathing soft.
I wanted to feel relief.
Instead, all I felt was dread.

By the time I pulled into the driveway, it was almost dawn.

I carried her inside, tucked her into bed, and turned to find my wife standing in the doorway.

Her eyes were red. Not from crying, but from exhaustion. Like she hadn’t slept in days.

She kissed our daughter on the head and I brought her to her room. I grabbed the baby monitor and headed back to my wife.

We hugged for what felt like forever.

Then she stepped back.

“Sit down,” she said quietly.
“We need to talk.”


Part 3
_____________________________________


I sat on the couch, still in the same clothes I’d driven to the hospital in. My hands were trembling. Not from fear, at least not exactly. From confusion. Exhaustion.

My wife sat across from me, elbows on her knees, staring at the floor. The house was quiet. Even the hum of the fridge seemed to fade.

She didn’t look angry. She looked… defeated.

“Before I say anything,” she started, “you need to know I believe you.”

That should have helped, but it didn’t. It only made my stomach drop.

“I saw it” I said. “She was burning. And then the screaming”

She nodded slowly. “I know.”

“What do you mean, you know?”

She lifted her eyes to mine. There was no hesitation in her voice, no confusion. Just a terrible kind of calm.

“It happened to me too.”

The words didn’t make sense at first. She must have seen that on my face, because she went on.

“When I was little. Three, maybe four. My mom said I had a fever that wouldn’t break. They took me to the hospital just like you did with her. Ran every test they could think of. Everything came back fine. The next day, I was perfectly healthy.”

She let out a shaky breath. “My mom told me later… I wasn’t the first.”

I frowned. “What do you mean?”

“It happened once before. To my grandmother’s baby sister.” She swallowed hard. “Her mother, my great grandmother was desperate. The doctors couldn’t help. So she went to see someone. An old woman on the edge of town who promised she could save the child.”

My wife’s voice trembled. “There was a ritual. A promise. The fever stopped that night… but something came with it.”

My chest tightened. “Something?”

“My mom always said it was meant to protect us. A spirit that guards the bloodline. But it doesn’t feel like protection.” She looked away, her voice dropping to a whisper. “It feels like it’s waiting for something.”

The room felt colder.

“Waiting for what?” I asked.

She hesitated. When she finally spoke, her voice cracked.

“For the next one.”

Her words hung in the air. I waited for her to explain, but she didn’t. She just stared past me, eyes fixed on something that wasn’t there.

“The next what?” I asked. My throat felt tight.

I frowned. “You mean this thing, this… spirit, it’s going after her?”

She didn’t answer.

“I need you to tell me the truth” I said, leaning forward. “Is she in danger?”

That got her attention. She blinked, looked at me, and finally said, “She’s not in danger. Not yet.”

“Not yet?”

“My mom used to say the spirit watches the bloodline. It doesn’t hurt the ones it chooses, it marks them. The fever is how it starts.”

I could feel my heartbeat in my ears. “Marks them for what?”

She shook her head. “I don’t know. My mother didn’t either. She said her grandmother refused to talk about it. All she ever said was that the child always survives but something else doesn’t.”

The room felt smaller. Heavy.

“What do you mean something else doesn’t?”

She looked down at her hands. Her fingers were trembling. “There’s always a cost. My great-grandmother’s baby survived… but her husband didn’t. … I survived. My father passed not long after.”

The silence that followed was unbearable.

“She said it was protecting the bloodline” I murmured, more to myself than her. “So why does it feel like it’s punishing us?”

My wife didn’t answer. She just stared at the baby monitor on the coffee table. The faint static hummed through the speaker.

Then, from somewhere deep in the white noise, came a soft, broken whisper.

“Daddy…”

But this time, it wasn’t our daughter’s voice.

My wife’s head snapped toward the sound. Her face went white.

“Did you hear that?” I whispered.

She nodded, but didn’t move. Her eyes glistened like she was remembering something she didn’t want to.

Neither of us wanted to believe it.

The voice came again, faint and broken.
“Daddy come in here”

She stood, but not out of curiosity. Out of fear. Her movements were slow, hesitant.

“Don’t” I said.

But she was already walking down the hallway.

She stopped at the doorway to our daughter’s room.

The light from the night light spilled out into the hall. Our daughter lay still, her breathing calm.

My wife whispered, “She’s going to be fine…”

Her voice cracked on the last word, like she was trying to convince herself of it.

I stepped beside her. 

We both just stared at the crib. The monitor in her hand hissed softly.

Then, through the speaker, so faint I almost missed it, came a voice.

Not my daughter’s.
Not my wife’s.

A whisper, cold and close:
“She is.”

The monitor went silent.

For a long moment, neither of us moved.

My wife’s hand found mine, trembling. Her eyes never left the screen.

And then, barely louder than a breath, she said,
“It’s already chosen.”

Something in me just… snapped. Instinct. Panic. Love. I don’t know.

I rushed past her and scooped our daughter into my arms. Her skin was burning again. Hotter than before. Her head rolled back and a hoarse scream tore from her throat.

“Help me!” I yelled. “Do something!”

But my wife just shook her head, tears streaming down her face. “You can’t stop it.”

My daughter convulsed. Her hands clawed at my shirt, her little fingers digging into my wrist.
That’s when it happened.

The pain.

It was like fire under my skin. It started where she grabbed me and crawled up my arm, slow and deliberate. I tried to pull away, but she held on tight, impossibly strong for someone so small.

Her eyes snapped open.

For one horrible moment, they weren’t her eyes at all. They were black, deep and endless, reflecting nothing.

Then she gasped.

“Daddy?”

Her voice was small again. Familiar.

The burning stopped.

She blinked, dazed, then looked toward the doorway. “Mommy? You’re home!” she said softly, a smile spreading across her face. “I missed you.”

My wife dropped to her knees, sobbing, clutching her to her chest.

“She’s okay” she kept whispering. “She’s okay.”

But she wasn’t looking at me.

I stumbled backward, clutching my wrist. The skin was blistered and red, the veins beneath it glowing faintly, pulsing like they were alive.

Every heartbeat felt wrong. Slower. Hotter.

Something was moving inside me.



My daughter is sleeping soundly again.

My wife is sitting beside her, humming the same lullaby she used to sing when she was a baby. There’s relief in her eyes, but she won’t look at me.

Maybe she already knows.

My hand won’t stop shaking. The burn has spread up my arm, moving towards my chest. Every pulse feels heavier, slower, like my heart’s fighting something it can’t win against.

It doesn’t hurt anymore. That’s the worst part. The pain’s gone but the warmth stayed.

Something’s alive inside me. Breathing. Waiting.

Our daughter is fine now. Her fever’s gone.
Mine’s just beginning.

Whatever saved our daughter didn’t leave.

It just found a new place to live.

The next night is when things took a turn for the worse. 

I had put her down to sleep around 8:00 pm. She was run down and exhausted. Body aches, fever, and a headache. I had been giving her medicine throughout the day and it seemed to only have a slight impact on her. In my mind the only thing that was going to help was rest and lots of it. 

She was asleep not 5 minutes after I put her in the crib. My nightly routine didn’t change. I grabbed the pillows and blankets from my bed and headed to the couch to be closer to her room in case she needed me. I plugged the baby monitor in and began to drift off to sleep.

I shot up. My daughter was yelling for me.

“Daddy! Come get me!”

“I’m coming baby!” I yelled loud enough for her to hear.

I made my way down the hallway to her bedroom. I swung the door open. Only to find her sleeping. Motionless. I stood there confused. I couldn’t have imagined this again. I stepped into the room. Only the sound of her soft breathing and the white noise machine. I stepped closer to her crib. There she was sleeping, not moving, not coughing, nothing. I didn’t want to wake her but I was shaken. This was weird, scary if I’m being honest. I heard her calling me. I know I did. This wasn’t exhaustion.

I returned to the living room, confused and worried. Was she talking in her sleep? Was she just seeing if I was nearby? I wasn’t sure of what was going on but I was starting to get worried. I felt fine but maybe I was getting sick. I did feel a little warm but had no other symptoms. 

I swear just as I was drifting off to sleep. 

“Daddy, I don’t feel good.”

I didn’t answer, I just ran, straight to her room. Nearly ripping the door off the hinges as I opened it.

Sleeping. She was sleeping. I couldn’t believe it. She had to be talking in her sleep. Maybe her fever had gotten worse. I stepped closer, this time determined to figure out what was going on. I reached into her crib to feel her forehead.

I recoiled the moment my hand touched her. Intense heat radiated from her forehead. My hand hurt. In awe I looked at my palm. A burn mark. 

My daughter was producing enough heat to burn my hand.


Part 2
_____________________________________

My daughter needed to go to the hospital. She needed help, more than I can provide.

I grabbed a few towels and rushed back to her room. I scooped her up and brought her to the car. I drove faster than I should but I needed to get her there.

I ran through the emergency room doors and straight to the check in counter.

“Help me please! My daughter she’s burning up!” 

I explained the situation the best I could. The worry on my face mixed with the details of the situation must have struck a chord with the nurses because they escorted us to a room right away. I placed my daughter on the bed. Through all of this chaos she was still asleep. After asking a few more questions and connecting an IV the nurse left and told me the doctor would be in as soon as possible.

I grabbed a chair and sat right next to her bed. She began to move and stir awake. 

A scream louder than I ever heard erupted from my daughter. Her back arched and vocal cords began to fry. 

I jumped to my feet. My ears were ringing from the volume of the scream. I could have sworn they began to bleed.

“BABY! BABY! WHATS HAPPENING! TELL DADDY!”

The scream continued.

I ran into the hallway searching for a doctor, a nurse, anyone that could help. No one nearby. I rounded the corner and saw a nurse behind a desk.

“HELP ME PLEASE! MY DAUGHTER, SHES SCREAMING! SOMETHING IS WRONG!”

The nurse paged for a doctor to my daughter’s room and followed me back.

When we walked in there was my daughter. 

Asleep.

The nurse walked to her bedside. And felt her forehead. She said she was warm to the touch but not extraordinarily hot.

My daughter’s eyes began to flutter open.

“Daddy? Where are we?”

Tears began to well in my eyes. “We are at the hospital honey. Something is wrong and these nice nurses and doctors are going to help us.”

The doctor came in about fifteen minutes later, clipboard in hand and calm in that practiced, detached way that only doctors can manage.
He asked questions, ran through the motions. Bloodwork, vitals, a scan.

When it was all done, he smiled.
“Good news. Everything looks perfectly normal.”

I stared at him. “Normal? Her temperature was through the roof. She was screaming, you didn’t hear it?”

He shook his head. “She’s stable now. Fevers can spike and drop rapidly in children, especially if they’re fighting something off.”

I wanted to believe him, but the words didn’t make sense. I held up my hand.
“Then how do you explain this?”

He leaned in.
There was nothing there.

No redness. No blister. No mark at all.

My voice cracked. “It burned me. I swear to God.”
He gave me that polite, cautious look. The kind that says we’ve seen this before.

I felt weak. My legs began to shake. I was going to pass out. The doctor grabbed a chair and told me to have a seat. They brought me water and did their best to calm me. It didn’t work at first but eventually I regained the little strength I had left.

They discharged us a few hours later.

The drive home was silent except for the hum of the tires on wet pavement.
Every so often, I glanced at her in the rearview mirror. She was asleep again, face calm, breathing soft.
I wanted to feel relief.
Instead, all I felt was dread.

By the time I pulled into the driveway, it was almost dawn.

I carried her inside, tucked her into bed, and turned to find my wife standing in the doorway.

Her eyes were red. Not from crying, but from exhaustion. Like she hadn’t slept in days.

She kissed our daughter on the head and I brought her to her room. I grabbed the baby monitor and headed back to my wife.

We hugged for what felt like forever.

Then she stepped back.

“Sit down,” she said quietly.
“We need to talk.”


Part 3
_____________________________________


I sat on the couch, still in the same clothes I’d driven to the hospital in. My hands were trembling. Not from fear, at least not exactly. From confusion. Exhaustion.

My wife sat across from me, elbows on her knees, staring at the floor. The house was quiet. Even the hum of the fridge seemed to fade.

She didn’t look angry. She looked… defeated.

“Before I say anything,” she started, “you need to know I believe you.”

That should have helped, but it didn’t. It only made my stomach drop.

“I saw it” I said. “She was burning. And then the screaming”

She nodded slowly. “I know.”

“What do you mean, you know?”

She lifted her eyes to mine. There was no hesitation in her voice, no confusion. Just a terrible kind of calm.

“It happened to me too.”

The words didn’t make sense at first. She must have seen that on my face, because she went on.

“When I was little. Three, maybe four. My mom said I had a fever that wouldn’t break. They took me to the hospital just like you did with her. Ran every test they could think of. Everything came back fine. The next day, I was perfectly healthy.”

She let out a shaky breath. “My mom told me later… I wasn’t the first.”

I frowned. “What do you mean?”

“It happened once before. To my grandmother’s baby sister.” She swallowed hard. “Her mother, my great grandmother was desperate. The doctors couldn’t help. So she went to see someone. An old woman on the edge of town who promised she could save the child.”

My wife’s voice trembled. “There was a ritual. A promise. The fever stopped that night… but something came with it.”

My chest tightened. “Something?”

“My mom always said it was meant to protect us. A spirit that guards the bloodline. But it doesn’t feel like protection.” She looked away, her voice dropping to a whisper. “It feels like it’s waiting for something.”

The room felt colder.

“Waiting for what?” I asked.

She hesitated. When she finally spoke, her voice cracked.

“For the next one.”

Her words hung in the air. I waited for her to explain, but she didn’t. She just stared past me, eyes fixed on something that wasn’t there.

“The next what?” I asked. My throat felt tight.

I frowned. “You mean this thing, this… spirit, it’s going after her?”

She didn’t answer.

“I need you to tell me the truth” I said, leaning forward. “Is she in danger?”

That got her attention. She blinked, looked at me, and finally said, “She’s not in danger. Not yet.”

“Not yet?”

“My mom used to say the spirit watches the bloodline. It doesn’t hurt the ones it chooses, it marks them. The fever is how it starts.”

I could feel my heartbeat in my ears. “Marks them for what?”

She shook her head. “I don’t know. My mother didn’t either. She said her grandmother refused to talk about it. All she ever said was that the child always survives but something else doesn’t.”

The room felt smaller. Heavy.

“What do you mean something else doesn’t?”

She looked down at her hands. Her fingers were trembling. “There’s always a cost. My great-grandmother’s baby survived… but her husband didn’t. … I survived. My father passed not long after.”

The silence that followed was unbearable.

“She said it was protecting the bloodline” I murmured, more to myself than her. “So why does it feel like it’s punishing us?”

My wife didn’t answer. She just stared at the baby monitor on the coffee table. The faint static hummed through the speaker.

Then, from somewhere deep in the white noise, came a soft, broken whisper.

“Daddy…”

But this time, it wasn’t our daughter’s voice.

My wife’s head snapped toward the sound. Her face went white.

“Did you hear that?” I whispered.

She nodded, but didn’t move. Her eyes glistened like she was remembering something she didn’t want to.

Neither of us wanted to believe it.

The voice came again, faint and broken.
“Daddy come in here”

She stood, but not out of curiosity. Out of fear. Her movements were slow, hesitant.

“Don’t” I said.

But she was already walking down the hallway.

She stopped at the doorway to our daughter’s room.

The light from the night light spilled out into the hall. Our daughter lay still, her breathing calm.

My wife whispered, “She’s going to be fine…”

Her voice cracked on the last word, like she was trying to convince herself of it.

I stepped beside her. 

We both just stared at the crib. The monitor in her hand hissed softly.

Then, through the speaker, so faint I almost missed it, came a voice.

Not my daughter’s.
Not my wife’s.

A whisper, cold and close:
“She is.”

The monitor went silent.

For a long moment, neither of us moved.

My wife’s hand found mine, trembling. Her eyes never left the screen.

And then, barely louder than a breath, she said,
“It’s already chosen.”

Something in me just… snapped. Instinct. Panic. Love. I don’t know.

I rushed past her and scooped our daughter into my arms. Her skin was burning again. Hotter than before. Her head rolled back and a hoarse scream tore from her throat.

“Help me!” I yelled. “Do something!”

But my wife just shook her head, tears streaming down her face. “You can’t stop it.”

My daughter convulsed. Her hands clawed at my shirt, her little fingers digging into my wrist.
That’s when it happened.

The pain.

It was like fire under my skin. It started where she grabbed me and crawled up my arm, slow and deliberate. I tried to pull away, but she held on tight, impossibly strong for someone so small.

Her eyes snapped open.

For one horrible moment, they weren’t her eyes at all. They were black, deep and endless, reflecting nothing.

Then she gasped.

“Daddy?”

Her voice was small again. Familiar.

The burning stopped.

She blinked, dazed, then looked toward the doorway. “Mommy? You’re home!” she said softly, a smile spreading across her face. “I missed you.”

My wife dropped to her knees, sobbing, clutching her to her chest.

“She’s okay” she kept whispering. “She’s okay.”

But she wasn’t looking at me.

I stumbled backward, clutching my wrist. The skin was blistered and red, the veins beneath it glowing faintly, pulsing like they were alive.

Every heartbeat felt wrong. Slower. Hotter.

Something was moving inside me.



My daughter is sleeping soundly again.

My wife is sitting beside her, humming the same lullaby she used to sing when she was a baby. There’s relief in her eyes, but she won’t look at me.

Maybe she already knows.

My hand won’t stop shaking. The burn has spread up my arm, moving towards my chest. Every pulse feels heavier, slower, like my heart’s fighting something it can’t win against.

It doesn’t hurt anymore. That’s the worst part. The pain’s gone but the warmth stayed.

Something’s alive inside me. Breathing. Waiting.

Our daughter is fine now. Her fever’s gone.
Mine’s just beginning.

Whatever saved our daughter didn’t leave.

It just found a new place to live.

I am a Catholic woman, very recently married to a lovely Muslim man. This is the happiest we both have ever been. He’s moving in with me soon and I have some questions about home decor and what is/what is not appropriate. 

I recently found the crucifix that was gifted to me by my mom. It was in my grandma’s casket during her wake, and I was very close with my maternal grandmother. It’s so beautiful and means so much to me. It is currently on a glass coffee table for display, but my husband mentioned it shouldn’t be there since it’s special and people might touch their feet on it.  I would love to hang this on my wall in my living room, but he doesn’t feel so comfortable with that, especially since he has a young daughter who will visit us. He said it’s symbolic of paganism, but I reassured him that I am not worshipping the cross. It’s just a beautiful reminder of my grandmother. Would it be very offensive to him to hang it on the wall? 

There were some other things in my apartment that he’s referred to as paganism but really don’t seem like a big deal for me to keep around, but please feel free to tell me if otherwise. I have an evil eye from my travels to Greece, one of those lucky cat figurines, and some sage that I’ve used for the apartment. I don’t worship any of these things and didn’t even know the symbolic meaning of the evil eye and lucky cat before he told me. These items are fine to keep, right?

The PlayStation Store lists Satisfactory as releasing on 4/11/25, but the confirmed global release time is 2:00 PM CET, which is actually 12:00 AM AEDT on 5 November here in Australia. That means it’s a simultaneous global release but the store page made it look like we were getting it a whole day earlier.

Because of that, I stayed up thinking it was dropping at midnight on the 4th, and wasted sleep for nothing. I planned everything down to the minute even synced a song to play as the game unlocked but it turns out the timing was too good to be true.

I was already suspicious that the schedule lined up a little too perfectly, and sure enough, it wasn’t the real unlock. Now I have to go through a full week of work before I can actually sit down and enjoy it properly.

Honestly, it’s not the wait itself that annoys me it’s that we were misled by an inaccurate store listing. If Sony Australia is going to have its own local storefront, it should show the correct local release date, not the European one. A simple timezone adjustment would’ve saved players a lot of frustration.

I must note that I’m not blaming Coffee Stain for the issue just Playstation AU/NZ who should know better when games release.",0,1762211626.0,SatisfactoryGame,7,0.27,False
1onrbp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/justpoetry/comments/1onrbp4/toughen_up/,Toughen Up,"They tell us to toughen up, But I see the look on his face, As the room quietens down, and every eye falls on him, Every glance cuts him open,

He opened up the other week, We were sitting in a coffee shop, Lost in chat - women, food, that latest film. I’m struggling he said in a low quivering voice, An echo of the usual lion that I recognised, He spoke some more of his demons and monsters, How they eat at him, rampaging his mind like an infectious parasite,

They tell us to toughen up, But as I sat there, I saw not my 20 something friend, The one that laughed and tricked and made everything tick But a boy, just small and fearful, Craving the loving arms of home and his mother.

They tell us to toughen up, But last night somewhere between the last beer can on the table and the shot glasses scattered in the kitchen, My friend asked me, With such heart and sincerity, “How are you?” It shook me to the core Ripped me inside out and made my legs sore,

I’m fine I quickly responded - That oh so well known saying, Was I fine when that thing happened - The one that left me speechless and numbed every emotion? Was I fine when the walls closed in on every waking minute? The breaths drawing shorter, quivering like arrows soaring through the sky, Was I fine when the cold sharp metal cut across my arm in the dead of night? Blood pouring in a fountain of agony and pain,

And as I thought in minutes later, As she went round asking my other friends with that same inflection, Were they lying the exact same way I was, Telling us to toughen up is just not the way, Are any of us fine living day to day? What is our destiny in a world so gray - To suffer, and smile, and say: “I’m okay”

1onr65s,https://i.redd.it/7ecn8x2zh4zf1.png,Help with Flavor Text on Savor the Moment Cards,"Hi all, I've completely fallen in love with Twinkle Twinkle especially reading some of the flavor text on the cards that come with the figures. I'm compiling them all for a personal project.

Can anyone help with posting the text for these figures that I don't have: Earl Teapot, and Matcha Cream Snow. Does the previous figures also have a card with flavor text? If so, I'd love for ya'll to share!

Here's the ones I already have, my favorite so far is Strong Bread and Coffee Milk Bath.

**Strong Bread:**

>*A strong loaf rises, full of might*  
*Soft white dough now firm and tight*

**Coffee Milk Bath:**

>*Take off all the masks,*  
*and give the dusty soul a bath*

**Macaron Moment:**

>*Put on your headphones*  
*Let music lead the way*  
*Back to the moments you want to save*  
*Music is a trip*  
*Go where the rhythms go*

**Lucky Pudding:**

>*Wave to joy to brighten your day*  
*Wait for bliss to come your way*

**Lazy Moments:**

>*Water, sunshine, air, and grassland*  
*Happiness simply lies in crispy croissant bread*

**Orange Marmalade:**

>*Clear your mind to make room for autumn and the sky*  
*Look up high, watch the sky*  
*Let your worries drift and fly*

**Cookie House:**

>*Like in a fairy tales the puppy*  
*and the ""pawrent"" lived happily ever after*

Thanks [naddyf](https://www.reddit.com/user/naddyf/) for these:

**Chestnut Cream:**

>*Soak in the sun, drift in the breeze*  
*Spend my life in days like these*  
*Simple and warm, a little slow*  
*With you, that’s all I need to know*

**Happy Palmier:**

>*Always rejoice with little delights*

**Star Candy:**

>*Sweet memories are stored in candy*  
*Take a taste when you are unhappy*

**The Eternity of Pizza:**

>*Take a bite while it’s hot*  
*Don’t wait til it’s not*",1,1762211239.0,TwinkleTwinkleCollect,8,1.0,False

Set up under the trees, lit a small fire, and everything felt perfect… until the rain kicked in overnight.

Woke up to the sound of raindrops on the tent and the ocean waves in the background — kind of magical, honestly.

The WindQuester tent and pads held up great through the rain, no leaks or soggy corners. Super cozy setup and a reminder why I love fall camping in BC.

Nothing beats waking up damp air, coffee by the fire pit, and that calm after a night of rain.
