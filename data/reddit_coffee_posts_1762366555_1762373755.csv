I have a lot of specific questions about life in that place and era, and am hoping to find someone who was an adult there at the time who might be available to answer them - from mundane things like ""*what was the equivalent of grabbing a quick coffee and a scone from a corner shop in a city?*"" to more serious-minded things like ""*did anyone talk openly about how many fringe religions were becoming popular on the islands prior to the Tokyo subway sarin attack?*"".

This is something that AI is purportedly available to help with, but it has very limited information on, given that it was the pre-internet era.   
  
For context, the class project involves an orphaned young woman taking a caretaker job high in the mountains and discovering that everything about her life was a lie - also there's Kaiju!

1opdsix,https://v.redd.it/where0yxwhzf1,Relay buzzing plus shots not hot enough,"First issue: As I discuss in this video, I started noticing a buzzing relay sound after pulling shots. I'm new to Breville and home espresso. After each shot, buzzing will continue for about 30seconds or until I interrupt it by tapping on  ""hot water"" on the screen. 
If I do need to replace something and this is not normal, please include part number or part name at least. 
Secondly, I wonder if this is the reason that I get fairly cold shots. Even with warming up my group head and cup and even using warm water in the tank I'm still not near the range of 190 to 200F at the highest temp setting. And possibly that's why my coffee doesn't taste as sophisticated and nutty as it does from the coffee shop regardless of playing around with dozing grind size and all that jazz.

1opdsh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1opdsh6/how_much_coffee_can_you_all_handle/,How much coffee can you all handle?,"This post may be not really suited for this sub, and should probably go to /r/coffee or something, but I'm really curious how my fellow exmos have handled this, since most of us were new to coffee in adulthood. So in that respect, I think it fits here.

I recently started drinking coffee a few months ago. I really enjoy it. If as much for the feeling of freedom and normalcy I get as the flavor. I haven't had a chance to get really adventurous and try many different things yet, but I generally am just drinking a dark roast with a little cream and sweetener. I will occasionally do black with some sweetener, but do I do love some cream in it.

However I have noticed a good amount of buzz/shakes if I don't accompany it with some food. I've been experimenting. I ended up with dark roast because it is supposed to have a little less caffeine, and I liked the flavor. And if I had a banana or some other food with it, it was generally ok, but still most days I would feel shaky or buzzy and just generally didn't like that feeling. I'm only drinking coffee maybe 3 to 4 days a week at the moment. 

It wasn't until today I realized that maybe the 16oz large I was drinking may just be over my body's tolerance level lol. So today I tried a smaller size and only had a glass of water before hand, just as a test. And I felt no ill effect at all that I could tell. Granted I was a little more active this morning too, so that might have had something to do with it. 

But I'm just curious what most of you have found you can drink on a daily basis before feeling the shaky buzzy effects? 

And to keep it relevant to the sub, I will say, it sucks that I'm still basically drinking coffee when my wife isn't around. She knows I drink it, but I don't bring it home if she's there, and don't dare brew it at home. She is upset enough that I'd drink tea at home in front of our kids!

1opdp69,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1opdp69/for_those_struggling_with_sour_shots_on_the/,For those struggling with sour shots on the bambino plus (how I finally fixed it),"I got my bambino plus about 2 weeks ago, and after about 20-25 shots of the most sour undrinkable garbage, I finally managed to pull decent shots.


I feel like a lot of newbies might struggle with the same problems as I did, so here are my tips for them.


I won't go into too much details about puck prep, but I got best results with 16g in 32g out (in about 30secs including pre-infusion) used WDT and a self-leveled tamper. This will vary a lot depending on beans and roast.


I was getting sour shots no matter what I did: too fine, too coarse, too slow, too fast, too much coffee (over 18g), too little coffee (under 15g). So I asumed that the problem was either: the beans themselves (either the flavour profile or the roast) or the temperature.


So I ordered some italian roast fresh arabica beans, and it made 0 difference.
I then ordered a dark roast 100% robusta, and it also did 0 difference, both were still super sour.


Problem was indeed temperature, the temp output is just not great on the bambino. So I tried to do blank shots, I tried doing shots with pressurized filter, I tried turning the steam wand on right before the shot, etc. No luck, no difference.


Finally what did work and made a huge difference was as simple as: using hot water. Just put hot water on the water tank, simple as that. Not boiled water, just hot from the tap (or whatever you use). That finally did make a HUGE difference, my shots went from sour and dull to thick, creamy and delicious, just by doing that.. no need to do anything else, just put hot (40-50 degree celsius) water on the tank. And if you don't mind the extra work, I recommend getting the hot water out after using it, as the reservoir is plastic.

Tl;dr: Put hot (not boiled) water on the tank/reservoir. That's it.",1,1762373386.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1opdn7x,https://i.redd.it/d8nn5wwiwhzf1.jpeg,Do you like Sir Chloe? Do you drive? Go to this concert with me.,"I found out early super early today that Sir Chloe is straight up having a concert in Seattle. They are one of my favorite artists ever since I started listening to them what feels like eons ago, I cannot even properly explain how much I want to see them play. My issue is that I do not have a car here so I cannot drive. I am a full time college student from another state. I am trying to find a buddy who likes the artist who drives or knows someone else who drives that enjoys them that would be down to spontaneously go to their concert thats happening TONIGHT. 8:30 pm. Please let me know if any of you are down. I am lowkey frothing at the mouth to see them play.   ",2,1762373258.0,olympia,0,1.0,False

I’m Kyle Wilson, a labor attorney born and raised in Santa Rosa, and I’m running for Congress in California’s new District 1. I’m not backed by any party machine or corporate donors, and have built my career fighting for working people. This campaign is powered by people who believe our system can work again if we organize from the ground up.

Watching Zohran Mamdani’s campaign win showed what’s possible when regular people take on entrenched power and actually win. That’s the energy we’re building here. Real change comes when communities stop waiting for permission and start building power together.

The affordability crisis is breaking people while the establishment looks away. It doesn’t have to be this way. If you’re tired of watching the same folks protect the same interests, let’s do something about it.

☕ **Join me for “Coffee with Kyle”**  
**Saturday, November 15, 1–3 PM at Brew Coffee Shop**  
Come talk about housing, healthcare, or whatever’s weighing on you. No speeches, no suits, just a real conversation about how we take our communities back.

1opdlut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1opdlut/i_hate_being_a_parentified_child_id_rather_just/,"I hate being a parentified child, I'd rather just parent my kids","Basically the title. This is mostly a vent post, with some support or similar experiences wanted. 

I was parentified as a child by both of my biological parents,b which has lead to many years of therapy and boundary setting. I thought we were in a decent place so now I'm trying to lean on them as my ""village,"" since I'm about to have 3 kids in 3 years. But they make it so damn hard because they were never successful parents. 

For instance, today my mother was supposed to come over before 8:30 to take over watching the kids so I could have a one-on-one with my boss at 9. I work from home and I do my best to take care of my children full-time at the same time. It's been okay, but now that I'm in the third trimester I'm exhausted and genuinely just can't make it work anymore. Hence needing my mother to nanny a few days a week. She didn't come over until after 9, so it ruined my meeting and all the other things I needed/wanted to do beforehand. Then she asked me stupid questions e.g. ""should I throw away that pear core that your baby pulled out of the trash and dropped on the floor?"" JFC yes, duh. 

Then the cream of the crop was my toddler fell off the couch and busted her forehead open on the coffee table. My mother immediately escalated the situation with very loud ""oh my gosh! Are you okay!? What happened?! I'm sorry!"" Which are all things I would say, but the delivery matters when talking to a 2 year old, I could hear her yelling through several walls and a different floor. Then my mother started crying and the toddler was crying. 

I had to come in, triage the situation, calm my mother down, calm the toddler down, calm the baby down, administer first aid and then take her to the doctor. When I returned I had to overly reassure my mother that kids fall, it's okay, here's how we react next time, etc. I remember doing the same thing at 7 when someone broke my tooth. 

I'm genuinely convinced it would be easier to not have my mother here ""helping,"" as I feel like I do more work teaching her how to be a caregiver than I can get done doing my actual job.

1opdfnt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opdfnt,4 years on HRT Anniversary.,"I think I look really good!

With the excitement over voting yesterday I completely ignored that it was my 4 year anniversary of starting HRT.  I am also still recovering from bottom surgery 5 weeks ago. If that wasn’t enough there is a local screening of the film “Over That Horizon” about my transition and acceptance within the kayaking community on Friday for friends and family at my local coffee shop. Then, in two weeks I turn 50! 

When the F! did I get this old? And why do I feel like I’m in my 30s, not about to hit 5 decades of life? Obviously estrogen is a magical elixir of youth. Meanwhile life goes on and I’m here for it. 

Recovery continues. I’m still sore and tire easily, however I am building strength and stamina back daily.  To be honest I didn’t expect to be still this sore at this point- but many friends say the big turning point is around 6ish weeks. I imagine the turning point is the soreness finally dissipates; I guess I will find out. 

Today I am super hopeful after all the election wins yesterday. Both Mamdani in NYC and Spanberger in VA explicitly prove that vocally supporting trans rights is a winning election strategy in the face of hate. This and all the other huge wins was the good news I needed today. 

I hope I see you Friday at the screening or on a river soon, Kay.",15,1762372804.0,TransLater,0,1.0,False

1opdezh,https://i.redd.it/qvcp2z02vhzf1.jpeg,"47F, high LDL","Hi all- I've been watching your posts for the past week as I just got results showing I have high LDL and high total cholesterol. I think there is a chance that the unfiltered coffee I had may have interfered somewhat with the results but I am also nevertheless changing my diet as my dad had high cholesterol and was on Lipitor almost his whole life and I'd like to use this as a wake up call.

I'm already close to vegetarian and eat a lot of beans but am really upping that intake, lowering salt, and switched to filtered coffee brewed in a traditional pot as opposed to my Italian moka pot method. :) 

I don't know how bad this is, these results, and both my parents passed away young. 

I also hike or trail run every day. I have gained wait because I had a big injury (big for me, lots of pain) on Dec. 2024 and that hasn't been dialed in yet. 

I went running for five minutes today and will keep increasing it stopping it if I have pain. 

I guess I'm curious if this could be an error or genetic since I try so hard to eat a high fiber diet already. 

What would you advise?

And I have to remind myself that that’s okay. I try to light an incense for the Gods once a day, I try to remember to thank Them all for my life and everything I am grateful for. Even if it’s a quick “thank you for all that you give and all that you take” over my morning coffee or evening cup of tea. I try to do a libation of water when I sit at my outdoor altar and offer wine when I have it in my home. Even when it all gets to be too much and I manage to only give my prayer of thanks once that week, in between the mess of life, I try to always keep Them in mind, in my actions and in my words. I try to feel Them all in the world around me. And it helps me stay connected even when it’s hard to get the words out, or crack open the books to read a hymn. 
I am grateful my journey has brought me to see the Old Gods anew. I am grateful that I can experience this. I am grateful for this community.
Thank you. May the Gods continue to watch over you all 🕊️

In fact, it's something they completely fear.

For me specifically, I go into every interaction with a stranger not wanting to be a burden. I assume with nearly every conversation ""They don't actually want to listen to me"" or ""I don't want to waste their time,"" leading me to overthink what the most polite thing is, and thus coming across as rude. 

For instance, if a waiter comes up and compliments my shirt, I usually say ""Thank you"" but am so mentally floored on ""do I compliment them back? Would that be awkward? Should I laugh loudly?"" that I end up just going quiet and then come across as a bit awkward and rude.

Recently, when I went to a coffee shop the barista said, ""We have Monday off so we'll be throwing out these deserts, if you want to take one they're free."" And my mind went to, ""Oh, they probably don't want me to say yes because then they have to heat it up without being paid for it and maybe they'll be able to take everything left over home and I'm taking from them,"" so I just say, ""No, I'm good,"" and then they look at me somewhat offended that I didn't take their offer for free deserts. And I realize that they were looking forward to exciting people with free food and I was somewhat of a bummer (who would have loved some free food).

When I walk through haunted house mazes, I worry that I'm not acting ""scared"" enough for the performers and don't want them to feel disappointed for not making me scared, so I say things like ""Woo! You got me there!"" but it feels insincere.

Even when a friend came over I mentioned cooking a dish for dinner last night and she said it sounds great so I showed her the leftovers. I wanted to offer her the leftovers, but assumed if I did she wouldn't want them and would feel awkward about saying no or taking something she doesn't want -- so I didn't offer her any and later realized how rude that probably seemed.

This is probably just a glimpse in my overthinking head (yes, I'm in therapy), but I just want to say that if you come across people who seem a bit quiet or struggle to match positive energy, please don't think that automatically means they think they're better than you. 

For some like me, I actually get super confused when I'm the subject of someone's attention I automatically assume I'm being a burden and want to help them by allowing the interaction to fizzle out.",1,1762372527.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I’m in SE MI, so I expect freezing of my compost. Also, I’m a tenant with no way of creating a more permanent composting station. Do you have any suggestions? Any tips? Or anything not to do?

My current build:
I drilled a few to several holes in the lid of the bucket, several holes along the sides, and holes in the bottom. I placed that bucket inside another 5 gallon bucket to collect any extra liquid run off or compost falling out the bottom. That bucket has just a few holes at the top. That allows air to reach the inside bucket’s side holes. The buckets are brown/black to generate more heat. 

My ingredients: 
I’m trying to treat it more like a worm bin and avoid heavily acidic fruits like oranges and kiwis, I eat a lot of those two. I’m shooting for a 1:1 of b:g. My browns are almost entirely leaves. My greens are (in descending order of mass) coffee grounds, bananas, zucchini, avoacado (no pits), pears, spinach, and a few other similar fruits and veggies. In other words, there’s a good bit of coffee grounds, so my pile is probably still gonna be slightly acidic, yes?

1opd645,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/1opd645/do_i_have_imaginary_friends_or_tulpas/,Do I have imaginary friends or tulpas?,"
I know some people are skeptical about topics like this, and honestly, I used to be too. I didn’t even know what tulpas were until recently. I always thought I was just a weird kid, and yeah, it still feels a bit cringe to admit all of this, but here we are.
I'm not exactly sure when it started, but it must have been around the time I was 5 or 6 years old. I remember not having many friends because I had changed schools. I felt really alone, so I started talking to myself, like a lot of people do… or at least I thought so. Over time, I began talking as if I were someone else. And instead of just one voice, there were two. They would talk to me, give opinions, and we would entertain each other.

Years passed, and they started to evolve. they began to have appearances, names, personalities, tastes, and even ideologies. What started as two became almost five. I used to draw them a lot and imagine being with them. I always thought they were just imaginary friends, but I knew it wasn’t exactly “normal” to still have them as a teenager, and even more now as an adult.

They are aware they only exist in my mind. They don't have a problem with it, although I think some of them would love to be real if they could. But they also know it’s impossible. They’ve never tried to harm me or control me. They’re more like friends or family. It feels like having siblings I grew up with. They help me a lot when I’m feeling down, giving me advice like any real friend would. Sometimes I follow their advice, sometimes I don’t lol
They know me very well, and I know them too. Sometimes they speak automatically in my head, and I respond without thinking much about it. I never really questioned their existence until recently when I came across videos talking about tulpas. When I researched more and heard other people's experiences, a lot of it sounded familiar.

I guess the difference is that they’re not hostile, and they don’t try to control me. The only thing they do is sometimes tell me how to react when I don’t know what to do, or act almost automatically, like in the movie Inside Out. The closest thing I can compare my mind to is that movie, except I can communicate with them directly.

They also have their own tastes. For example, I’m not really into coffee, but one of them loves it. One of them enjoys reading, and I don’t. Another one loves spicy food, and I don’t really like it that much. They even get into silly arguments sometimes, but it always feels playful. Like a family living inside my mind.

I know it might sound like I’m schizophrenic, but I’m not. I don’t really know if they’re tulpas, imaginary friends, or if I’m just weird. At this point, I don’t really care. I know they’re not going anywhere, and honestly, I don’t want them to. I don’t think I could live a normal life without them.

1opd5q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1opd5q6/guts_part_one_the_cabin/,GUTS: Part One - The Cabin,"The mysteries of the natural world have always intrigued me, with the flora and fauna that accompanies us upon the Earth. For all my four decades and some change, I have studied what I could manage. It was hard for a man of my stature, short and from elsewhere, the United States of America has never truly been terribly kind. I find myself oftentimes met by men of different breed stating that my own ideas were wrong and incorrect. They would laugh at me, ignoring that despite my name and face, I knew little about where they assumed I was from and had nothing much in common with the people there.

Admittedly, I did not help the matter with my determined realm of study. I fancied myself a cryptozoologist, and that merely made everything all the worse. So I began to document the things I have seen and the things I have done, and though my name, Javier Diaz, will never appear in any officially published letter, and my so-called amateurish insights will never be accepted by the masses, I am comfortable in the knowledge that I am correct in my mission, and I know without doubt that I am not crazy, nor insane. I have seen what crawls through the inky darkness of night, and I have seen what can steal the stars right out of the sky.

This unusual expertise of mine has led to my fortuitous position as a recognized expert in my chosen field. Students come to me, eyes bright and hearts full of questions and others come to me under another guise. They hide secrets behind the fear in their eyes, and have pictures, scribbles and drawings and the written scrawled whispers of rumors that they’ve followed, heard and seen. These people ask me for help, to correct the problems they face. They do not know what dangers lurk beyond the walls of their homes and they believe me capable.

Oh, I wish I was more capable.

When Marlene Brenner came to my office around evenfall, a feared look in her eyes and her face pale, I knew something was wrong. She smelled like gun oil and bath salts, and wore her night clothes, wrapped in a bath robe and still wearing her slippers.

“Madame,” I pleaded as she barged her way into my office as I opened the door. Tears streaked her face, and she collapsed on the couch along one end of my room, her head in her hands, her raven black hair covering her face. She sat there for a long moment, taking in long shuddering breaths in the gathering darkness. “Are you alright?” I asked, stealing a look at the street outside.

My office was part of a small strip mall on Main Street in the town of Ennis, Montana, which was small and pitiful and mostly known as a through-way to Yellowstone or the more well-known Virginia City. It was a pit stop, and because of its nature as one, it often collected the strangest sorts. Old couples lived here, to finish out the golden years of their lives, and Californians and New Yorkers came to build condos for young couples that would never show up. Peering through the windows of my office, I could see an old truck parked haphazardly on the curb. Its brights were on, yellow light blazing a path up the boardwalk to my door, like a beacon, showing the way.

“Something,” the woman finally said after minutes of silence. “Something is hunting us.” She looked up, handing me a photograph. I took it and turned the lamp on my desk to get a better view. The image was dark and confusing, shapes seemingly moving in the shadows around the picture of a quaint cabin.

“Madame, I assure you, I do not understand.” I said at last, handing the photo back. Marlene hiccupped out a sob and shook her head, pushing the photo back towards me. “What is it?” I asked. She wiped tears from her eyes and attempted to compose herself. Her emotions now under control, she regained her breath and stood to her full height, which unsurprisingly was taller than me.

“My name is Marlene Brenner, and we need your help, Doctor Diaz.” She said, her voice full of fear stamped down by a quiet resolve. “Something is stalking us, it has already taken one of our dogs and my husband and I fear for ourselves, and more importantly, our children.” She tipped her head towards the door. “We would like you to come to our home and see for yourself.”

“Ma’am,” I started, but she held up a finger, telling me to be silent.

“We will pay whatever is necessary, but we need your help, doctor.” The look in her eyes spoke the truth well enough, and though I knew better in any other way, I relented and allowed her to take me to their cabin, nestled to the north, under the watching eyes of Sphinx Mountain. The truck was small, perfectly suited to a family that builds their home in the mountains and tries to use it as little as possible. It was very nearly falling apart and clearly could use some love and care. It lurched forwards violently every time Marlene used the shifter, and I felt like the wheels were only a few bumps from flying off the axles.

It took upwards of forty-five minutes to get to the cabin in the woods. I stepped out of the almost warm cab of the truck and my boots crunched into the dry leaves and gravel of the driveway. My breath floated out into cold fall air, and I wrapped my jacket a little tighter around myself, gaining my bearings. The cabin was modest, built by hand and made well. It sat in a clearing of trees, alone against the gathering dark. The sun had almost fully set, and Marlene was ushering me with haste through the front door.

I walked up the steps to the porch, my case in one hand, and entered the house. The warmth inside was pleasant, and not overly hot. It was well lit, and Marlene’s husband sat on the couch in the living area, staring intently on a rifle laid out in parts in front of him, like he was trying to will it back together with his mind. Marlene shut the door behind us, and I heard the clicking of multiple locks, and saw from the bay window as she shut off the porch light. She quickly drew the curtains on the window, tight and secure, and sat on the couch beside her husband, taking his hand in hers.

I looked around the room for a moment. It betrayed itself, speaking of a life well lived and full of love. The interior had a few mounted trophies, no doubt from the families’ own hunting prowess, and I could see children’s toys, laying on their sides all around the living room. A dog lay, alert, by the front door. He was a German shepherd, and the collar around his neck read ‘Captain’. There was a dog bed next to Captains, and that one was empty, save for a collar hanging on a hook on the wall above it, with the name ‘Bucky’ engraved. I turned, sitting down in a chair set across from the Brenner’s.

“I’m aware that you know who I am.” I said, setting my case down at my feet and leaning forwards, steepling my fingers. The house may have been nice, but the subtle stench of rot did indeed hang in the air, like a ghost, waiting for its moment to strike. “And your wife,” I pulled the photo out of my pocket and placed it on the coffee table. “Gave me this. I don’t know what to make of it, but I am certain you can tell me.” I nodded my head towards the husband. It took a moment, but he looked up.

The fear in his eyes was electrifying. It surpassed the fear in the eyes of his wife. The husband picked up the photo, looking it over. “My name’s David.” He said, placing the photo back down. “It’s not a good picture, but the thing is there.” He pointed to an oddly shaped shadow at the edge of the image. “One of our trail cams, we have one pointed towards the house, got the picture a week ago. It was the morning our dog, Bucky, went missing.” I leaned forwards, peering at the image.

The numerous pixels and dark edges of the photo seemed to merge, but as I focused, I thought I saw something pale in the darkness, sneaking into the trees. It was large. I picked the photo up for closer inspection, and David continued.

“I went looking every night for Bucky, but I couldn’t find him.” He paused. “Until yesterday.” His eyes seemed to glaze over as he lost focus, staring at the empty dog bed and the collar that hung above it.

“What did you find?” I asked after a moment of hesitation, not truly wanting to know a definitive answer to the question but knowing that I had to ask. If I did not, then we may never get this family out of this strange nightmare they believed they were living.  I placed the photo back in my jacket as I listened to David.

“I found him.” David said softly. “Hanging, a few miles up the mountain, in the BLM.” His voice broke for a second. “He… he was hanging and eviscerated.” He wiped his face, staring into empty space. “It was like someone had field dressed him. All that was left was just wet skin, hanging from a noose made of sinew and guts.” David met my eye with a grim look. “A pile of bones were under the skin, broken. It looked like someone had sucked the marrow right out.” He sighed, looking down at his hands. “I had that dog since I was a boy.” He said softly. Marlene placed her hand on his arm.

“He buried him out back,” she explained. “But,” a pause. “But something dug it up and took the corpse. All we had left was the collar.” She looked back at the empty bed and the collar hanging on the wall. I nodded, jotting down a few notes in a tattered leather-bound book I always kept on me. I closed it, latching it shut, tracing the embossing on the front. Two dragons, caught in eternal battle. I allowed my mind to wander for a moment, to things I have seen in dark forests like these.

Crawlers, along trees and buildings, feasting on sadness. The Striders, bringing mist and a chilling cold. The Eat. I wiped my eyes, rearranging my glasses in the process. I was not doing myself, nor these fine folk, any good by dwelling on something like that. I looked up and nodded again, my expression grave.

“So, you wish for my assistance, in discovering this thing?” I asked. David nodded.

“We have a guest room. You can stay with us for a few days, find out what is out there.” He offered. I held up a hand and shook my head. I was not one to impose my presence upon others, especially families, even when they offered such kindness.

“I can sleep outside, in my tent or the truck, if necessary, I assure you.” I said. David let out an exasperated sigh, shaking his head into his hands.

“No.” He said with not a small degree of finality. I was taken aback by the tone of voice he used, as it was definitive and a little commanding.

“Pardon?” I asked, leaning in. David looked up, his eyes dark.

“We’re safe in the house. You’ll be a target if you’re outside.” He insisted, gesturing to an open door down the hall behind me. I turned, looking at the dark doorway that led into what I assumed was the guest room. “We need your help, doctor. Please, stay with us.” I sighed and nodded.

“Fine. Fine. I assure you I will be pleasant company for your family and will not get in the way.” I said, standing. David stood and we shook hands, firmly in the way that men do. David seemed like a gentle soul, and the pain I could see in his eyes and hear in his voice seemed to cut him deeper than any blade. I had only seen a man in such a state a few times, and often in the mirror. I bade them goodnight and picked up my case. My room was small and had only a chest of drawers and a bed. It smelled stale, but not in a bad way. It had the scent of sheets that were washed but had been unused for months. The window curtains were closed as well. Curious, I opened them a crack, peering out into the dark.

Was it my imagination, or my eyes playing tricks? Did I truly see what I believe I saw out there, lurking among the trees? My heart hammered at my ribcage, and I closed the blinds, taking a moment to breath. Whatever was out there, I was certain I could handle it. These things are usually non-threatening, and when they are they merely require a change in attitude. I shuttered my lights and closed my door. I sat on the edge of my bed, my journal in my hands, and closed my eyes, working through the raging thoughts in my mind. I returned to the possibilities I had been exploring earlier.

Crawler? No. They usually inhabit more populated areas and while they do prefer the cold, and God knows it was cold in Montana, there was simply not enough emotion here to draw them out. Striders were too large and simply did not travel this far south. The only one I had ever seen was in Canada, on its way through to Alaska after all. My mind wandered on to other things, other monsters I may have seen in the dark, what else had I even documented? The Eat? I shuddered at the thought and almost turned the lights back on, but I knew better. My associate liked the dark, and I did not mind its company. I could see it, in the corner of my eyes. That dark shape, lingering just out of view, feeding on whatever sorrow I still had.

The Eat. I knew it was not this, I knew its modus operandi, but I also knew that my fear outweighed my reason and in an ill-advised attempt to comfort myself, I opened the curtains of my window. The moonlight bled in, silver in the dark. I paused for a moment, holding onto the curtain and looking out the cold glass, my breath fogging it slightly as I peered into the dark. I could see something. Something was out there, definitively, moving about like some kind of stop-motion puppet.

The shape was something I could not define, but it put to rest my worries of this being an occurrence of the Eat. That was a shadow among shadows and this was something pale, naked and wet. It seemed to be pacing in the tree line, then after a moment, I could see it stop. Branches, naked from fall, moved out of the way as something pressed itself through the tree line and took its first step into the clearing. I knew it was nonsense, but I felt as if I could hear the leaves crunch under its heavy step.

The thing started to walk into the clear moonlight. Its body was pale, naked and almost human. Its stomach was distended, and its flesh was covered in welts and blood- and pus-filled pimples and pustules. My breath caught in my throat as I slowly pulled the curtain back over the window. “That was unwise.” I said to myself once the darkness had enveloped my room once more. I lay down, and tried to close my eyes, forcing myself to find sleep.

It did not come.

But I could hear the thing outside. I felt exposed, like I was lying out under the stars and not inside a building. The house was sturdy, and it could not enter, but I could hear it walking around the perimeter, its feet crunching in the leaves. This lasted hours, and only then was I able to find my rest.

It should be common knowledge that in the profession of ‘monster hunter’ (a moniker I abhor as it insinuates that monsters are things that need to be killed or can be killed at all when in my experience that’s an impossible task) one becomes very experienced with night terrors, sleep paralysis and nightmares. I was not someone unique in the fact that I was plagued with all three. Constantly.

That night was no different, as it was a nightmare I was comfortable with, but it sparked unease in me regardless. It started normally, with me standing at the edge of a cliff, looking out over the ocean. I was somewhere in Iceland, and I could almost smell the fresh breeze and feel the cold air against my face. Next to me stood a man, who was holding a book, and he wouldn’t stop laughing. His face was torn, so that his head was more of a naked skull than a human face. I could hear no joy in his laugh as it grew louder and louder, and suddenly the cold air grew hot and warm. The man seemed to be engulfed in flames.

I screamed out in pain as I watched the fire reach the water and it seemed like the entire ocean was ablaze. I watched my hands, turning them as my flesh flaked away and my bones were charred black.

I woke up with a start, a heavy feeling in my chest, like I was being pinned down. I couldn’t catch my breath as I tried desperately to move. My limbs would not budge, as I was locked in place. I tried to take a deep breath, but it was like I had rocks sitting on my lungs, keeping pressure and making it almost impossible to breathe in. The terror lasted only a moment and ended when I noticed the shadow at the foot of my bed. I sat up, free of my paralysis, and glanced around. My associate had left, taken what it needed and vanished. I knew it’d be back; it always was. Part of me had grown accustomed to its presence and I felt very alone without it.

“Not alone.” I assured myself. “Never alone.” I turned and opened the curtains, letting the light of mid-morning flood into my room. With a groan I stood, stretched and got dressed. I exited my room to enter a much happier house than I had experienced last night. I could hear the clicking of a dog’s claws as Captain, the great German shepherd, ran to and fro, playing with Brenner’s daughter, who looked about six years old. Their son, about eight, sat at the table. Both children took more after their mother than their father, but the daughter had her father’s curly red hair.

“Ah, you’re awake.” David said, a smile on his face. I could tell it was forced, a mask for his children. Part of me wanted to urge him to be honest and open with them now and tear the mask away because they certainly knew something was wrong. “Children, this is an old family friend, Doctor Javier Diaz.” He said, introducing me to the kids. I learned then that the girl was Bailee and the boy was Seth, and I joined the family at the breakfast table.

“Are you here for the monster?” The boy asked me in a hushed whisper, glancing over at his parents. David glanced up, concern on his face.

“Seth-“ He said. I held up a hand.

“It’s alright David.” I picked up my fork and cut into my pancakes. “What monster?” I asked. Seth looked ashamed almost, turning away and playing with a rogue strawberry on his plate.

“I’ve never even seen it.” The boy said. “But I have heared it, outside.” He pointed to the windows. “It sounds big.” I shook my head, taking a bite.

“There’s no monster, Seth.” David said. Marlene looked between us, worried. I nodded.

“Your father is right, Seth.” I said. “Just some coyotes, wandering around.” Seth narrowed his eyes and furrowed his brows.

“I know what a coyote sounds like, mister.” He said. “And it’s not one of those.” We ate our breakfast in silence, and when we were finished, I helped the parents collect the plates while the children wandered off to their room to get properly dressed.

“You shouldn’t be hiding this from them.” I said as I placed the plates in the sink. David glanced at me, putting the ingredients away in the fridge.

“They don’t need to know what’s out there, not yet.” He said, finishing up.

“I can’t tell you how to parent,” I said, “but they know something is wrong.”

“You said you wouldn’t get in the way.” David reminded me, turning, his eyes dark. I held up my hands, apologetic.

“I apologize.” I said. “David, you and I should venture into the forest today, before it gets dark.” I said, changing the subject. He nodded and I turned away to gather my things. The children ran past me to their parents as I walked into my room and shut the door. I opened my case and removed my equipment. It wasn’t a lot, just a few simple things that I have found useful over the years. Some medical grade facemasks, a pair of leather gloves, a pair of latex gloves, a heavy metal flashlight, a bundle of dice made from knuckle bones (reasonably sourced I assure you, but yes, they are human) and a knife. I wrapped myself in my jacket and pulled on my gloves, grabbing my trail hat as I left the room.

“You’re the man of the house, Seth.” David said as I entered the main room. “You gotta protect your mom and your sister, alright?” His voice was grave, and I could see that Seth understood the gravity of what that meant. What world do we live in that eight-year-olds must shoulder such burden? I often wonder if we grow too fast, or if the world around us is too dangerous for our own good. I adjusted my gloves as I stood, a little awkwardly, to the edge of the room.

When David had finished giving his son his mission, he stood and came to me, a rifle in one hand and a shotgun in the other. He offered the former to me, holding it out. I looked at it for a moment, considering. I imagined the feel of it in my hands, familiar after all this time away from such tools of death and destruction. I was almost tempted to take it, to wield it against the dark. How well had that gone before? A few broken bones for me, a hole in the wall, and the thing I shot at laughing at me. I buried the thought and shook my head, denying the offered weapon.

“I’ll do fine on my own.” I assured him. David arched an eyebrow. “And with you as my bodyguard, I have never been good with firearms and fear if I were to carry it, it may accidentally go off in the wrong direction.” David relented and slung the shotgun over his own shoulder. He was bringing a veritable arsenal with us, as he had his two long guns and a pistol at his hip. In contrast, I seemed woefully unprepared, carrying only my knife at my side.

David let out a sharp whistle and Captain’s ears perked up. “Here boy!” The dog leapt to his feet and made his way over, standing still at David’s side. He gave his wife a short kiss goodbye, and we were out the door, stepping into the cold fall air. I shivered slightly, more from apprehension than cold, as we made our way to the tree line.

“You saw it last night?” I asked, finally breaking the fragile cold silence between us with a breath of warm air. David sighed, nodding.

“It comes to the house every night, I think.” He muttered, picking his way through the brush as we broke through the first few feet of the tree line. “Usually from different directions in the trees, trying to stop us from finding where it comes from, I think.” He pointed to a trail cam set up about twelve feet on a tree nearby. “So we set trail cams. I had them set lower, but it kept taking them down, so we put them a bit higher, trying to catch sight of it. See where it comes from.”

“Any luck?” I asked, stepping wide over a fallen dead branch and trying not to trip on an uprooted tree trunk. I hopped a bit to regain my balance and continued to follow David through the dark forest. It was early afternoon, and so by all rights the sun should be beating down on us, but the thick pine tree cover and the heavy dark aura of terror between us kept that light away. It was a shame, because I would have liked to feel its warm rays bathe me aglow, and keep my heart a little more hopeful.

“No.” David said, curtly, after a moment of thought. “We’ve seen glimpses, pieces here and there, but never the thing in totality.” He ducked under a branch, then pulled it out of the way for me. I walked passed, and he let the branch swing back into place. “But, I remember where it left Bucky, so that’s where I’m taking you.” He said. I nodded.

“I thought as much.” We made out way through the trees and onto a small game trail. There was enough space to walk single file through the forest. The path twisted in on itself and wound back and around the trees multiple times. The course was so erratic and twisting that I lost my bearings more than once. The hairs on the back of my neck wouldn’t calm down, and a prickling sensation trickled all the way from my scalp to my toes. I felt like something was watching us. Occasionally, I’d hear the odd heavy footfall, and the sound of something heavy dragging through dead leaves. Yet when I looked, the forest would be as dark and as empty as ever.

The truly strange thing was the complete lack of sound. I was used to the chirping of birds, the calling of various mammals and the skittering of bugs and rodents, but there was nothing but a dead, creaking silence that was occasionally punctuated by the wind clacking dry tree branches together above us. Every sound made me jump, and the silence made those moments of feeling watched all the worse. What was out there that would empty a forest of life?

Finally, David stopped cold in his tracks, his neck craned up to the trees. I stopped next to him, looking up. Bits of sinew were still hanging on the branch, cut at the ends, where David had removed Bucky’s corpse.

“He was here.” He said, his voice quiet. “Hanging, all alone.” I let him sit in the silence for a moment as I explored the area. The air was cold and sharp, and nothing smelled unusual, but I could hear something up in the trees. Turning my head up, I squinted, trying to catch sight of anything moving up there. Then I saw it. It looked like a windchime, sitting in the tree, made of bone. It was gently clinking together, making small, hollow ‘tink’ noises. I noticed that in the bone were carvings and holes etched into it, causing each blow of the breeze to cause the chimes to whistle slightly.

“Mister Brenner,” I said, breaking the man out of his depressed stupor. He turned, a question in his eyes. Before he could speak, I pointed one gloved finger up at the chimes, about ten feet above us, hanging from a branch. He followed my direction, tipping his head curiously at the sight. “I believe,” I said, “that whatever this creature is, has been decorating the borders of its territory.”

“You think Bucky was a warning?” He asked. I nodded. This behavior was common among animals, bears would mark and scent trees that bordered their territory, and clearly this creature was smart enough to mark its own territory. Perhaps the way it did it was gruesome, but in the end the effect was the same.

“Perhaps it thinks you are on its territory.” I offered. “And Bucky was likely a warning for you to stay away.” David frowned, his hand on his rifle, and his eyes deep in thought. He paced for a moment, the crunch of his feet in the leaves and needles putting me on edge.

“I’ve lived here for twelve years.” He said, finally, turning towards me. “I won’t let this thing drive me from my home.” He seemed to decide something with himself and set forwards, Captain warily following him deeper down the trail.

“Mister Brenner!” I called turning. I knew this was a bad idea, and we should turn and probably run away as fast as we were able, but David clearly did not have the same reservations as I did. “David!” I called out. The man stopped, shadowed under the trees, his eyes full of menace. Something inside of me grew frightened more of him than the thing lurking out here.

“I plan to kill this thing, Doctor Diaz. And you will not stand in my way.” He growled out. I was clearly right to be afraid. I held out a hand, showing peace.

“I’m not saying we can’t.” I said, slowly. “I want to make that clear. This thing is dangerous, but we need to understand our situation more. Let us head back to your home and make a real plan that we can action without any danger coming back to your family.” David opened his mouth to refute but I cut him off. “David. If you attack that thing now, unprepared and full of rage and hate, and you do not kill it dead, it will kill you, then attack everything you love.”

Finally, he relented, coming back into the light at my side. “Fine. I don’t like this though.” He said. I nodded in agreement.

“Neither do I.” I turned towards the tree, squinting back up at the wind chime. I noticed that more were threaded through the trees, like some kind of macabre fence of singing bone. I jumped as a yipping filled the silent air and the branches and leaves underfoot crackled. I turned, and so did David, only to come face to snout with a small gray fox. It’s ears twitched and it turned, bounding away and yapping and calling in the strange way that foxes do.

I shook my head with a chuckle and took a firm grip on the tree. I started to climb, to get a better look at the bone chimes above us. When I came into view, I took out my notebook and carefully sketched what I could see. The bone was a fair distance from the ground, but I could make out the vague shape of what was carved on the chimes themselves.

It seemed to tell a story. It depicted a large humanoid creature with distinct reptilian features making its way through a waterlogged swamp, then through a door, and then through the mountains, this time that same reptilian creature seemed to be thinner and weaker, and the flesh of its face had fallen off. Undaunted, I finished my drawings and notes and was about to make my way down the tree when I froze. There was something in the trees around us, I could hear a raspy, breathy kind of wheezing coming from underneath me.

“Do you hear that?” I called down to David as I started to move again, carefully placing my feet on thick branches, climbing slowly down the side of the tree. He nodded, staying silent. I hit the ground and brushed loose needles off my clothes, glancing around us. The day was dying, and night would set upon us sooner rather than later.

Then I heard something else in that darkness around us, within the trees. I heard the distinct and horrible sound of frantic scared yipping and the horrible, awful sound of something breaking bones and the scream of a far-off animal dying. David and I froze, and Captain turned, growling into the dark. David lifted his rifle, trying to pierce the dark with his eyes. I pulled my light from my belt and flicked it on. The yellow beam of bright light cut through the dark, lighting the trees and throwing their long, hand-like shadows across the forest around us. I squinted into the dark, swinging the light carefully from side to side.

“We need to leave.” I whispered. “How far are we from the cabin?” I asked.

“Roughly three hundred yards.” David whispered. I swore under my breath. If there were no trees, I would have been more confident, but the confusing, twisting landscape of a forest on the mountain made three hundred feet a lot harder to get through, especially since we were reaching the end of the game trail we had followed to get as deep as we did. We were losing light, and I was losing hope.

I moved the light back through the trees, my breath ragged. I tried to slow my erratic heartbeat by trying to take a few deep breaths, breathing in deep through my nose. The stench of the air round me almost made me gag and throw up, however. It was a sudden and horrible kind of smell that seemed to come right out of the rot of corpses and several day-old entrails. It was a stench I had only caught in war, and never in the field of research I now favored. David covered his nose in disgust and Captain whimpered, taking a few steps back.

The air had grown hot and wet, and it felt like grease was being applied directly to the inside of my lungs as I started to back out of the trees, following David as we started to move again, trying to get out of the forest. I heard something creaking behind me and cautioned a glance, swinging my flashlight around to meet the brief sight of something moving in the trees.

It almost caused me to fall to the ground.

There was something following us, and it was bigger than I had ever thought. I didn’t catch a good sight of it, but recounting this now, I wish I had seen it more then, so I didn’t have to suffer the sight of it properly later. The brief amount I did see was pale and peach colored, like raw human skin, and it was covered in sores. I saw its hand, its horrible, horrible hand, with seven long fingers, almost as long as my entire forearm, as it held tight to a tree before quickly disappearing into the dark.

Panic now well and truly set in my heart, David, Captain and I made our way through the dense brush and finally into the clearing. We did not stop there, as we could hear the twigs and leaves crunching and snapping behind us as something heavy moved through them. We only stopped as the door to the cabin shut behind us and we locked it. Marlene looked up in surprise from her place within the kitchen, and the children glanced up from their books on the couch. The room was silent for a moment as David and I caught our breath and Captain lay, cowering, on his bed. I glanced out the window, pulling the curtain back for a peek out at the dark and jumped back in surprise.

An eye was pressed to the glass, staring at me. It was large and pale, as if someone shoved a balloon into the empty eye socket of a skull. It sagged and seemed to be lit up with a ghastly flame. The eye quivered as the thing on the other side pressed itself closer to the glass, its breath fogging the window. I quickly closed the blind and turned back towards the family. I looked at the children, then at the parents.

“It’s outside.” I said softly.

“What’s outside?” Seth asked, looking up at us.

“Nothing, baby.” Marlene said softly, wiping her hands on her apron and walking to her son, meeting him on his level. She wiped a strand of black hair from his eyes. “We’re going to be fine.”

“Famously,” I said, adjusting my jacket. “Things tend to get worse when we say that.”

Raising a Toast to Everyday Joy: Norm’s Entrance in Cheers
==========================================================

Every bar has its regulars, and every life has its routines. But when Norm Peterson walks through the doors of Cheers, it’s not just another day for him or the patrons; it becomes an event. His entrance is an anthem of camaraderie, laughter, and a zest for life, reminding us that joy can be found in the simplest of moments. In this devotional, we’ll unpack the delightful significance of Norm’s dramatic arrival and how it resonates with positive biblical themes.

### The Joy of Community

There’s something magical about the way the Cheers cast welcomes Norm. His entrance is met with cheers from his friends, emphasizing the profound impact of community in our lives.

- **Ecclesiastes 4:9-10** teaches us that “two are better than one.” Norm embodies the idea that joy is multiplied in the presence of friends.
- **Acts 2:46-47** tells us how the early church thrived on community, gathering together and sharing meals with glad hearts.

Norm’s entrance serves as a reminder that we all need a circle of support—a group that celebrates our joys and stands by us in our struggles.

### Daily Rituals: Finding Joy in Routine

Norm’s arrival in Cheers is more than just a habitual visit; it’s a ritual filled with anticipation and happiness. Think of it as a celebration of daily life.

- **Psalm 118:24** declares, “This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.” Even in our daily routines, we can find reasons to rejoice.
- Norm’s entrance teaches us that every day has the potential to be extraordinary if we approach it with joy.

Celebrate the little moments. Whether it’s a morning coffee, a sunset walk, or a friendly chat with a neighbor, receive each day as a gift.

### Lifting Each Other Up

The cheers and smiles Norm encounters symbolize the importance of lifting each other’s spirits.

- **1 Thessalonians 5:11** encourages us to “encourage one another and build each other up.”
- In a world that often feels heavy, let your presence become a cause for celebration, just like Norm’s.

When Norm walks into Cheers, he not only brings himself but also invites a wave of positivity that impacts everyone around him. Strive to be that source of encouragement in your community—be the reason someone smiles today.

### The Blessing of Laughter

Norm’s entrance isn’t just about friendship; it’s also the laughter that fills the air.

- **Proverbs 17:22** tells us that “a cheerful heart is good medicine.”
- Laughter has the power to heal, uplift, and transform not only our own spirits but those of others around us.

Make time to share laughter with friends and family. Whether it’s through a funny movie, a light-hearted conversation, or shared memories, let joy take center stage.

### Conclusion: Make an Entrance

As we reflect on Norm’s grand entrance at Cheers, let’s remember it’s a call to action for our own lives.

- Be the person who lifts others up.
- Celebrate life’s everyday moments.
- Cultivating a close-knit community should be a priority, where support and encouragement flow freely.

So, as you step into your day, channel your inner Norm. Let your presence be a beacon of joy, excitement, and friendship. Remember, life isn’t just about the destinations we reach, but the joy we spread along the way. Cheers to making every entrance one that inspires and uplifts!

1opczq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/1opczq6/i_feel_defeated_and_hopeless/,I feel defeated and hopeless,"My husband (26) and I (23) have been married almost two years now. We love each other very deeply and are each other’s best friends but it has not been a smooth ride. We get into pretty intense fights and I have even had to stay the night elsewhere a couple times. For him, incidents have progressively gotten further apart and been resolved quicker over time. For me, they’ve gotten closer together and more intense over time. 

We have a few points of tension. My struggle for control and tendency to provoke when I’m not getting what I want. His laziness and overspending. I wanna start by saying I am honestly usually the problem, especially these days. I have a horrible tendency to nag out of anxiousness, or just break down into nervousness. Frankly I don’t know what to do for my own situation besides continuing to try and pray and be in the word more. I used to have a lady I met with who I could talk to, and that helped too. Unfortunately I can’t see her anymore, only rarely. But I just want to say that to clarify the specific thing I’m feeling defeated about is in no way to ignore my own wrongdoings.

I’m having a particularly hard time with my husband’s spending. He likes to eat out, and also has a hobby of collecting premium Bibles. For the food, we established a budget. $30 a week. But he always goes over this, telling me he’s sorry and something like he was just tired and needed more coffee or he was having a hard week and needed a pick me up. This always ends in him realizing he shouldn’t make excuses and should keep his word, and me offering ways to help him cope with cravings like sending him to work with a larger coffee, or getting a certain snack from the grocery store because at least it’s cheaper than him caving at the gas station. I’m at my wits end with repeating this cycle. Increasing the budget won’t help. It used to be $40 and he would go over that too. The apologies are starting to mean nothing to me and I just get angry. To make matters worse, he frequently hides the purchases from me or tells me half truths, like saying he only got coffee but later I see a donut wrapper in his lunch bag. He’s very aware that our budget is tight, and right now it’s even tighter cause he’s in school, but the spending is getting worse.

The second thing is the Bibles. He’s into premium ones and it drives me absolutely insane. I see the appeal of having a few as long as you use them. I’ve gotten a few over the couple of years we’ve been together. But there is always a new one he’s chasing. He talks about them all the time, tells me we have to get them on flash sales, justifies through his teeth why he needs a third premium Bible in the same translation he already barely uses. He gets fomo about limited releases of anything and I think that’s part of it. I want him to enjoy his hobby but our budget can’t take any more and he just doesn’t seem to understand why it drives me crazy when he begs for something we can’t afford.

I don’t know how to communicate with him about money anymore. I don’t know how to deal with the fights in general. I feel like we solve things then it instantly happens again. He doesn’t wanna go to counseling or anything so I’m just stuck. He’s not tanking our finances or anything, we aren’t doomed. But we discussed financial goals and agreed on it, yet he never keeps his word in this area. What do I do?

# 🍽️ Margay Diet: Arboreal Hunter

The Margay is classified as a carnivore but has an omnivorous diet, with meat making up the majority of its food. Their diet is diverse and reflects their ability to hunt both in the trees and occasionally on the ground.

Primary Prey: Their diet focuses on small-to-medium vertebrates. Due to their highly arboreal lifestyle, they frequently prey on arboreal mammals like squirrels, opossums (marsupials), and even small primates such as marmosets and tamarins.

Birds and Reptiles: They are highly successful at catching birds and their eggs within the canopy, as well as various reptiles and amphibians.

Terrestrial Prey: While predominantly tree-dwelling, Margays will descend to hunt terrestrial mammals like rodents (rats, cavies) and agoutis.

Non-Meat Items: Unusually for a cat, Margays also consume fruit and other vegetation, possibly to aid in digestion.

Intelligent Hunting: Margays are known for being clever hunters. In a remarkable display of hunting strategy, one Margay was observed mimicking the call of a young pied tamarin to lure adult monkeys into an ambush—the first documented case of a Neotropical predator using this type of mimicry.

# 🌳 Life in the Trees: Adaptations and Behavior

The Margay's survival is intrinsically linked to the dense forests it inhabits, thanks to specialized physical features and unique behavior.

# 🌎 Habitat and Distribution

Range: The Margay is found from Mexico, through Central America, and into South America, reaching as far south as Uruguay and northern Argentina.

Home: They are strongly associated with dense forest habitats, including tropical evergreen, deciduous, and cloud forests. They are occasionally spotted in shaded coffee or cocoa plantations but rarely cross open, deforested areas.

Arboreal Master: They are considered the most arboreal cat species in the Americas.

# 🤸 Acrobatic Adaptations

The Margay's incredible agility is due to key evolutionary adaptations:

Ankle Rotation: Their most defining feature is the ability to rotate their ankles up to 180 degrees. This allows them to grasp branches equally well with their hind and forepaws, and, crucially, allows them to descend trees headfirst, like a squirrel—a feat almost unique among cats.

Long Tail: Their exceptionally long, thick tail provides critical balance as they leap up to 12 feet (3.7m) horizontally and maneuver through the complicated network of branches.

Large Paws: They have relatively large feet and are capable of hanging from a branch by a single hind foot.

Considerations for a [Margay as a pet](https://theanimalsound.com/margay-as-a-pet/): While their agility is fascinating, it also highlights why these wild animals are ill-suited for domestic life.

# 🌙 Lifestyle and Reproduction

Behavior: Margays are largely solitary and nocturnal, resting in hollows or dense vegetation in the trees during the day and becoming active at night. They are territorial and mark their home ranges (which can be 11–16 km$\^2$) with scent.

Lifespan: In the wild, they are estimated to live for 12–14 years, while in captivity, they have been known to live for over 20 years.

Reproduction: Their reproductive output is naturally low. After a gestation period of about 80 days, the female typically gives birth to only one kitten (rarely two). The kittens are born relatively large, open their eyes around two weeks, and begin eating solid food at about eight weeks. Females may only give birth once every two years.

# ⚠️ Conservation Status

The Margay is currently listed as Near Threatened (NT). While its main threats are habitat loss and illegal hunting for its fur, it's worth noting that the desire to keep [Pet](https://theanimalsound.com/category/pets/) small wild cats sometimes leads to exploitation. The cat's reliance on dense forest cover, combined with its naturally low reproductive rate, makes it highly vulnerable to human encroachment. Due to its status as a wild animal, understanding the reality of keeping a Margay as a pet is crucial for conservation awareness.",1,1762371667.0,TheCuteanimal,0,1.0,False

I’ve been committed to getting a better understanding of this disease and have been officially diagnosed! It was a relief to be acknowledged even though I knew I had lipedema. I’ve also had a few consultations with surgeons and am deciding which to go ahead with for surgery (likely not until 2027 though). I’ve never spoken to friends or family and just hide my lower half as much as possible with baggy clothes.

Anyway, today I went for coffee with one of my best friends and plucked up the courage to tell her I was diagnosed with lipedema and am going to get surgery. Her response? “You’re only getting the surgery because you’re too lazy to exercise” and then she laughed. 

I was crushed. I get that people don’t understand this disease but it’s so crushing to be seen as lazy. I’ve found the admin and research and appointments just getting to this point so overwhelming and it just sucks that the first person I share with in my ‘real life’ is so dismissive and thinks I’m lazy.

I guess im just sharing to feel a bit less rubbish and to feel less alone, grateful for this community as people really just don’t understand how exhausting the lipedema experience can be",3,1762371417.0,lipedema,1,1.0,False

I'm not delusional enough to think he likes me back but should I just say fuck it and flirt? Or at least let him know how beautiful his eyes are?

He then said he'd come to my seat once he figured it out and sing it to me.

**Day 3: The Bohemian Cadenza**

Finally, the day arrived - the Bohemian one. Morning sun promised luck. The campground reception, with its annoying three-stage checkout, decided that Germany ended at its gate. But finally - the Road. Sliding down to the Elbe, hurrying to meet noon at the top of Jánské Kameny. A short coffee stop in Hřensko, then up into the hills crossing Bohemia.  Left turn onto a secondary road - leaving behind the tourist swarm.

The road gave up tarmac in exchange for climb. A knife-edge ridge, a weathered sign warning about something forbidden (maybe another trail?). And then - a breathtaking downhill, stones clattering under the wheels. Two thoughts left in my head - don’t f...ing brake and hope that spray was just sealant. The valley opened below, framed by monumental cliffs. A gravel descent - the loaded bike flying down, chasing the shadows of birds. The feeling of solitude there was incredibly refreshing.

The second uphill burned my legs, sowing seeds of doubt about life choices and possible alternatives. A bench at the top and a handful of nuts marked the conference with Komoot. My position was clear: only one way - down and up, up and down, shake and repeat. So the plan remained the same.

Bohemia ended not with a road sign, but with a feeling. It was as if I’d crossed into the outskirts of some ""far more northern Slavic neighbour."" A chain of villages caught between epochs and mountains - and no place to refill a bottle of water. A turn to the right, back into the forest.

Lužické hory, in their own way, cheered me up with an uphill slick and fatty as butter. A manually operated rail crossing. Road construction ahead - fresh, half-finished, and already abandoned. Even the machines looked as if people had just left them for a smoke - and never came back. The forest was getting darker. Solitude, once cherished, started asking for payment.

Meanwhile, the first one was done. Two left - marked ""I"" internally, rolling up to a farmstead on the hilltop. A few workers were doing something near the gate. My Czech was barely enough to say dobrý den, and my knowledge of classical Russian literature - just enough to ask for water. The answer came in something halfway understandable, then circled back through a pinch of languages. We spoke like distant cousins reciting a psalter - the words half-guessed, the meaning somehow clear. Four languages, two bottles, and five smiles before I rolled away.

The road stretched forward, punching through the forest that wrapped the next hill on the horizon. A lone tree by the roadside added a faint echo of a classic American road movie. Smooth tarmac made riding easier - even uphill, which eventually happened. Hopefully, just circling around the 700-metre peak. Under the trees, the view became no less cinematic, quietly reminding me what I’d forgotten there. A side road brought an accidental companion and added another flavour to solitude: sharing the road, each of us riding our own line, side by side. He stayed on the tarmac, following the road left; I pushed forward through a gap in the bushes. The descent that led to the next climb began there.

I slid down easily, catching breathtaking views of the mountains on both sides, enjoying the speed. The villages filled my personal collection of fifty flavours of Fachwerk. A lorry driver, clearly unused to being overtaken by a cyclist, honked in disbelief. My bad - too good a tarmac, and too heavy a bike.

Suunto beeped: ""2nd category climb, 100 meters."" Those bordo-colored segments that had terrified me for months on the elevation profile finally became reality. It was short, thankfully, but I was already searching for a nice spot to pause - and a decent excuse to do it. A couple on e-bikes strolled past (with those faces... you know, yeah?). Well, challenge accepted - the bar can wait if someone drops yours. I caught up and passed them right at the moment my route turned right. Suunto beeped again: ""Categorized descent"" (What the hell is that supposed to mean?). I stopped. A road sign flashed ""Freistaat Sachsen"", without a single mention of Germany. I looked back - the Czech sign made that part quite clear. The mountain part was, technically, over.

Yep, it was - except for that ""categorized"" downhill: too steep for a calm village, and soon turning into cobbles that led further down to Oybin. The rain, as promised by the forecast, decided that at least something had to be on time in Germany. With smoking brakes, I rolled into a smoking grill house. Wet both inside and out, at least I finally had a reason for a snack break and a makeshift lunch.

The Donnerteller was great - in both senses - but, like the rain, it didn’t last. My phone blinked: a message from the Arnrb host asking for my ETA. So, time to move on. Bottles refilled - now strictly in German - I rolled into my fourth region of the day.

The Saxony part wasn’t much to tell. It’s Germany: well-organised and perfectly made - to the point of boredom. Like staring at a fashion model and finding no nick to make her look human. Fifty flat kilometres. Except for the bright yellow wheat fields fringed by the mountains I’d just left behind - and, holy moly, a steam train! One cycle path ran between cities along the highway; another cut through a park, then followed the Neisse River dividing Germany and Poland. A monastery with a monument to John Paul II stood by the water - a quiet reminder that borders divide maps, not people who keep crossing them.

One more medieval-looking town. A turn to the right, as usual into the depths of the fields - and there it was:  a signpost of ambition and irony near a café. Mallorca, Paris, Oslo - all within one pedal stroke. I smiled, took a sip of lukewarm water, and moved on. I was still in the Not-Good-to-Be-Late Land. As usual, no road signs - but something in the air told me the outskirts of a big city were near. And then, finally, Görlitz.

114km recorded. The best route of my life was officially done.

**Day 4: Adagio in Görlitz**

A day off. Görlitz - pure magic: pastel facades, cobblestones, the whole city like a movie set paused mid-scene. Yet here and there - abandoned houses, shuttered shops, even a freshly renovated hotel in the city center, already for sale.

The sun kept me company all day long, and over a beer, I had that strange release-day feeling: Teams and Slack cascading with alerts - but no keyboard, no screen. Surreal, but oddly comforting.

I made chole chawal today, finished some design improvements, and later brewed myself a really good cup of coffee. After a long shower, I stepped outside and looked at the moon. Somehow, it made me feel peaceful from the inside.

After preparing the meal, I decorated my table with a bit of food aesthetics, and when I clicked a picture of it, I started thinking about you. For a moment, I wanted to send it to you. But I didn’t.

I still miss you. I miss talking to you, sharing the little details of my day, listening to yours, and just talking nonsense for hours. It’s strange how something that felt so lovely and warm could end so suddenly. How could something so beautiful just stop existing?

Then the anxiety hits again, that tightening in my chest like my ribs are shrinking and I can’t breathe. It feels exactly like that day when you told me why we shouldn’t be together. You said I was a great guy but not your type. That you needed someone with more ambition, abs, and personality.

A good and kind human with a decent voice, that’s me. And I guess that’s all I have to offer.

After the call ended, I covered my face with a pillow and cried. I looked horrible, but I couldn’t stop. My head felt heavy, so I went to the kitchen, washed the dishes, and tried to find a funny reel on Instagram, hoping to laugh at something, anything. But I couldn’t. The pain was louder.

A couple of days later, I realised I had forgotten to wish my mom on her birthday. It was the same day we stopped talking. I felt like a soulless human, just moving through the day without purpose.

First things first idk coding I have absolutely 0 knowledge in it but rn I'm learning them slowly by slowly just learned HTML and CSS learning JavaScript rn. So first thing

1. Which languages do i need to learn to start making a game? I'm thinking to make like a tea house or something with the cat on the counter sleeping yawning awake licking paws meowing uk cats are important part of life even for cozy games i heard the term sprites alot dk what that means but I want the cat to be a bit pixelated but not the background of windows and stuff nor the counter the should be clean. Also I want to add interaction to the cat like when you tap on cat she meows or when she's sleeping you can't tap on it.

2. As for CHARACTERS I'm thinking to not show any characters as it's haram to draw humans (hope it's not same for cats) so I was thinking to just add plain texts so the main problem is here idk what to do so there are customers with no look ik i can't just make it all black outline of a character i need some ideas on this it's probably impossible though (sad emoji)...... I'm definitely going for black outline tho.

3. And now I need suggestions like how should the game because? Like ther should be a room with bed a window and the cat on the desk a bookshelf and desk light and nothing much but idk how to give it a cozy look for now i have this image in my mind I just can't potray it in words so my imagination is you wake up looking at th ceiling (ugh it's hard to imagine a good cozy look on th ceiling) and then it transitions to you standing near the door and it gives the full view of windows bed and desk with cat (idk bookshelf went somewhere lol) with sunlight coming through the window birds chirping sound (peaceful so peaceful i tell you) and besides the sunlight coming through window the bed side is a bit darker while the sunlight coming through windows is lighter bed being right side and desk being left side. A ceiling with a fan probably (?). And ofc curtains on the windows that are at the left and right corner so sunlight can come in (or better to not add it?). This was my bedroom idea what do you guys think? Ofc car on the desk. And a pot of plant infront of the window (there's a gap inward from the window)

4. Now the main game looks and area. So we just press go to counter to start the game and I'm thinking to add Day 1 something like these like before you wake up it says the day you are on. So here visualization part 2 we are on the counter one the right side of counter a cat is sitting (our beloved cat ofc) licking it's paws and doing the vat thing or becoming a Loaf every 1 min and then there's 2 table on the far right side of the restaurant/tea house. Windows on the left side of the restaurant/tea house and when a customer comes in the ringing bell on the door rings like those in japanese restaurants uk the chin na chin chin something like this. Ofc the chirping of birds continues and doesn't stop at all. With pot of plants in the window and besides the window at right side near the table (or maybe i shouldn't add the table as the cat will be blocking the view anyway) i don't have it perfectly imagined honestly the counter view that is.

5. THE MAIN GAME idk what type of game i should make which would be cozy and calming type?!! Like just a customer (black outline) comes in and he asks for a tea or coffee or juice ?! And how do I make it like there will be a text saying his name and telling a bit more about himself and then asking for that certain coffee and do i just add the give coffee button? Sounds like a plan but not much interaction and interesting at all if it's not a good gameplay so I need suggestions on this. Honestly I can do a bit of an art as I like drawing (except I can't draw humans nor any living things that doesn't exist) I'm also not gonna add any music or songs at all that's also haram from my side.

6. Day and night cycle I'm thinking to add this too the gameplay will be 3-5 mins only and the timer stops when talking with a character. Also adding a clock to see time we start at 9 am and end at 8pm but idk how to transition between the day and night cycle as you can see from the window? Like make it night after it hits 6pm? Like it just goes morning to night? Or do I add 3 transitions like when it hits 3pm the morning becomes evening type and make all the blue sunny sky into orange evening vibes through the window and then when it hits 6pm make it dark with stars through the window it's the transition idk how to transition in i mean in what way.

7. Also I'm thinking to add another interactive thing where we can peek from our bedroom window and I'll draw some stuff there too need some ideas on what we are gonna be seeing our there. ALSO during the night you can here the chirr chirr of the insects (idr what those insects are called Cicada i think)

8. As for story/lore of us i haven't thought much about it grandpa inheritance became too common and how we are here and why we are doing this is what I suggest for peaceful and calmness like tired of city life and came here to run this Cafe(cafe sounds better then tea house or restaurant). ALSO we are living in a small town where it's just greenery out and we garden type around our Cafe.

9. So do I make it a story type game or all you can play anytime game? Like idk what would I do when by day 66 or 75 or at a set day all the lore or story of the characters are over. Do i just keep continuing it or just end the game im still new so adding different endings and stuff is still out if my hand. Honestly I'm thinking to make it a one time game but for cozyness and for the people who love these types of games I'm thinking to make in unlimited days but idk what to do after lore of every character is over. Btw one character per morning evening and night. 3 in total looks too much I'll make it 1-2 per day if possible.

So yeah this is how much I have planned about this game I'm still wondering about how the gameplay should be I can add lore to characters and can make atleast 5-10 different characters (not draw just add lore and black outline of them) also Cafe sounds better then tea house or restaurant also yes the color i imagined the color to be brown meaning everything is made out of woods.

Thanks for reading all this long ahh stuff im happy to receive guidance. Have a good day y'all

Suddenly a friend confesses crush for me, it would be an affair for the last 4 or so weeks of my marriage. Heart say yes, head says no, please help me think through this.

Ive been thinking of divorcing my wife of 10 years for a few months now. I lurked this subreddit and got the book ""too good to leave, too bad to stay"" and literally couldnt get past the first question: think about a time when things between you and your partner were at their best. Looking back, would you say things were really very good between you back then?

I can come up with moments. A walk, a movie, a time we had sex. A long talk into the night. Sure. But days? Weeks? No, because sooner or later, her depression gets stronger which means days of me taking care of her. She's gotten into therapy and on medication and it's gotten better, where these episodes that used to happen 3-5 times a week happen maybe once every two weeks. But for years it was pretty rough, always taking care of things. Through this time we drifted apart, we have separate friend groups and we barely see each others family. (No kids, just a dog).

Well, she had another episode, accused me of cheating on her, basically dumped misery on me for an hour, also including saying how I should leave her because she's so damaged etc. (I have never been unfaithful, I have poured my heart into this relationship). And I just realized, wow, 10 years, I've been through some version of this at least 1000 times. And I thought about the next 5 years and felt a yawning gap open in my stomach and told myself I cant do this. I'd rather be alone.

So here is where it's complicated. A few days later Im hanging out with a friend I made last year. She actually started flirting with me back then, but I shut her down, saying Im married etc. but we stayed friends, got coffee, lunches etc. We work in the same industry, have a lot of shared interests, we also met each others friends. She once took care of our dog when we went on vacation.

So we're hanging out, it's almost time to head back to work and she stops me and say she's developed feelings for me. She knows Im married and she doesnt want me to be a boyfriend or anything, she just really likes me and is attracted to me. She wants to know whether she should abort this crush or if I want to do something with her. She apologizes, is afraid that I'll terminate the friendship, but she wanted this to be out in the open. I've told her about my marital troubles, not in any real depth, just that hey, I'm in deep shit now, I think this is the end, I'm going to be pretty down for a while etc.

Now Im fighting over what should I do. I do like her, I am attracted to her, I am not looking for a new relationship. Im very down, talking with my therapist, getting my shit together to get a lawyer and start the whole divorce process. I've already sat on my floor and cried holding my knees. I havent told my wife anything yet, I feel I need to gather enough energy before I kick things off to not fall apart.

What's your perspective on going along with my crush?

On the one hand, it will complicate things on many levels. Secrecy, lies. It will also make me colder towards my wife. (I'm caring, just not as explosively caring as I used to be when I thought this is for life).

On the other hand, GOD I want someone to run their hand through my hair, hug me, touch my face. I've been starving for touch for years now. When my crush admitted her crush, I froze up and shivered because wow, *someone* found *me* attractive? Especially because she's not looking for a relationship, more like a friends with benefits thing.

I made chole chawal today, finished some design improvements, and later brewed myself a really good cup of coffee. After a long shower, I stepped outside and looked at the moon.

After preparing the meal, I decorated my table with a bit of food aesthetics, and when I clicked a picture of it, I started thinking about you. For a moment, I wanted to send it to you. But I didn’t.

I still miss you. I miss talking to you, sharing the little details of my day, listening to yours, and just talking nonsense for hours. It’s strange how something that felt so lovely and warm could end so suddenly. How could something so beautiful just stop existing?

Then the anxiety hits again, that tightening in my chest like my ribs are shrinking and I can’t breathe. It feels exactly like that day when you told me why we shouldn’t be together. You said I was a great guy but not your type. That you needed someone with more ambition, abs, and personality.

A good and kind human with a decent voice, that’s me. And I guess that’s all I have to offer.

After the call ended, I covered my face with a pillow and cried. I looked horrible, but I couldn’t stop. My head felt heavy, so I went to the kitchen, washed the dishes, and tried to find a funny reel on Instagram, hoping to laugh at something, anything. But I couldn’t. The pain was louder.

A couple of days later, I realised I had forgotten to wish my mom on her birthday. It was the same day we stopped talking. I felt like a soulless human, just moving through the day without purpose.

So after months and way too many coffee-fueled nights, my team and I finally shipped something that actually works. It’s a platform where you can create your own AI Agent, basically an AI teammate that handles support, chats, calls, all that good stuff.

I wanted to share a bit of what I’ve learned while building it because honestly, a lot of people talk about AI automation but not about how it actually comes together behind the scenes.

When you’re creating an AI agent, it’s not just connect GPT and go. You need to define its identity, what kind of tone it uses, what model it’s built on, and which channels it’ll talk through like chat, email, or voice.

Then there’s the knowledge side, the data you feed it. That’s the real engine. If your AI doesn’t have a good, structured knowledge base, you’ll just end up with a glorified parrot. We had to build a whole system just to track what the AI didn’t know yet, basically a missing data loop that helps it learn from its own gaps.

Another big part was figuring out workflows. People underestimate this part. It’s like giving your AI a brain map. You tell it what to do when a chat starts, when to pass a customer to a human, or when to ask for feedback. Without workflows, your AI just reacts instead of acting with purpose.

If you’re trying to build something similar, maybe an AI agent for your SaaS, customer support, or even your personal project, I’d be happy to share what worked and what definitely didn’t 😅.

We’ve been using our own system for a few weeks now, and seeing it handle real conversations while we sleep honestly feels surreal.

I'm a mom to 4 girls. The first two are 16 years old, one is adopted (she was adopted shortly after she was born) and they have a month difference. Then I have a 5 year old and a one year old.

I'm debating if we should have a fifth kid basically because I don't know if I can manage two teens, two toddlers and a newborn. The teens are basically independent, they don't help with their sisters (as it is supposed to be!) and I help them manage through this important stage of their life by listening to what they have to say (yes, I know all the gossips around) and having little coffee afternoon dates just the three of us. They only help around the house, like making their own bed and keeping things clean when they make messes. Sometimes they take their little sister to dance classes, nothing more. 

Economically speaking we're good, the baby won't affect our wellbeing. But I don't know if I can actually be as present as I am now for my girls. I don't want to rely on my older daughters to raise my kids, and I'm scared that if I have another one they'll feel like they're obliged to help around.

My husband loves our girls, and we won't try to have a fifth just to have a boy. We don't care about the gender, it was just a dream of mine having 5 kids. I won't absolutely have ""gender disappointment"" if it's a fifth beautiful girl.

as if paper could resurrect what I buried.
Each letter is a grave I keep visiting,
each word a flower I lay for something that will not bloom again.
The ink runs like veins across the page,
and I wonder if it misses being blood,
if it remembers what it’s like to be alive inside someone.

I write your name the way a prayer folds itself in half,
with shaking hands and a heart that won’t stay quiet.
Your name used to sound like sunrise,
now it falls from my mouth like ash.
Every word I write is both a confession and a curse,
a bruise pretending to be forgiveness.
Sometimes I think the letters write me instead
pulling pieces of my soul through the pen
like silk caught in a thorn bush.

I tell you about my days,
how the coffee still tastes like the silence you left behind,
how mornings feel like empty churches
where I keep trying to worship something that stopped believing in me.
I tell you that I’m fine,
but the ink shakes like it knows I’m lying.
Even the paper sighs beneath the weight of your absence,
as if it remembers when my words used to be lighter.

You once said love should be gentle,
but I was all sharp edges and teeth.
You reached for me and I mistook it for danger,
bit the hand that tried to hold me steady.
Now I write with that same hand trembling,
inked in the kind of regret that stains more than it dries.
I wonder if the moon feels this kind of longing
when the sun turns away each morning.

Sometimes I think of sending these letters,
folding them into paper birds
and setting them loose into the wind.
Maybe they’d find you in another life,
land softly in your hands
like forgiveness disguised as flight.
But I know you won’t read them,
and maybe that’s mercy
some words are too heavy to survive the journey.

If you ever wonder,
yes
I still love you.
But love feels different now.
It no longer burns it bruises.
It lingers like smoke in the lungs,
something you can’t breathe out without losing air.
You live in every poem I try not to write,
in every silence that tries to swallow me whole.

These are the letters I’ll never send.
They sit in a drawer like sleeping ghosts,
dreaming of being forgiven.
Maybe someday, when time has softened my hands,
I’ll take them out and read them again
not to remember you,
but to remember the version of me
who believed that words could bring someone back.

1opcbr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1opcbr4/im_a_hospital_nightshift_maintenance_tech_dont/,I’m a hospital night-shift maintenance tech. Don’t ever open a door that says SERVICE. Pt1,"I don’t even know if anyone’s ever going to read this.

I’m just dumping it into Notes because it’s the only app that still opens right now, and the battery icon’s been stuck at 18% for… I don’t know, a while. Long enough that I’m starting to hate that number. The time in the corner says 2:17 a.m. and hasn’t moved.

If this ever pops up on somebody’s screen and it just reads like some guy falling apart, that’s… yeah, that’s probably accurate. I’m not going to pretend I’ve got this under control. But if you’re the kind of person who wanders into stairwells with no signage “just to see where they go,” I need you to read this all the way through.

And then I need you not to be that person.

I work nights in building maintenance at St. Alban’s Medical Center in Phoenix. Technically, my badge says “Building Systems Technician II,” which sounds like I should have a lab coat, but in reality I still plunge toilets and un-jam automatic doors.

St. Alban’s is one of those hospitals you drive past on 7th Street near the 202 and don’t really notice. Beige concrete, mirrored windows, sad little shrubs that die every summer and get replaced every winter.

I’m thirty–four—wait, no, I had a birthday in June. Thirty–five.
My brain keeps defaulting to thirty–four like it’s trying to save me one year on the wear-and-tear.

Night shift is usually quiet. A couple nurses, one ER doc, a sleepy security guard. The building settles into this constant background noise: HVAC, ice machines, telemetry alarms, wheels on linoleum. It all turns into one low hum. You don’t notice it until it stops.

The night this started, I was covering for Kyle, who called out “sick” but I’d bet a week’s pay it was because the Coyotes had a late game. Midnight to eight. I grabbed a cup of cafeteria coffe before they shut down at eleven. It already tasted like the pot was on its second day.

Around one, my radio crackled.

“Facilities, this is admitting,” Rojas said. “We’ve got a flickering light in the old admin corridor. It’s giving Mrs. Harvey a migraine.”

“Copy,” I said. “I’ll head up.”

The “old admin corridor” is the forgotten wing on three that used to have HR and billing before they moved everything downstairs and half-online. Now it’s dusty records, empty offices, and people who don’t want to be found.

I grabbed a ladder, a spare 2x4 LED troffer, my tool bag, logged it, and took the service elevator up.

The doors opened onto a dim hallway. Motion-sensor lights clicked up as I walked: hoodie, scuffed boots, badge with a curling “HAPPY 35” post-it.

The bad light was easy to spot—one panel twitching bright/dim/off like it couldn’t pick a setting. I set the ladder up, climbed, and popped the diffuser.

The plenum above should’ve been a throatful of sound: air handlers, duct noise. It was still. Cooler, too, just enough to raise the hair on my arm.

The LED panel looked fine. Wiring solid, no heat marks. The sticker on the back, though:

LITHONIA LIGHTING 2G7 2X4 TROFFER 4000K.

We use 2GT8s. I’ve written that model number so many times my hand could do it alone.

“Sure,” I muttered. “Typos all the way up the chain.”

I gave a tired little laugh.

Then everything turned off.

Not just the light. The building.

HVAC roar, ICU beeps, distant traffic—gone. My ears rang in the vacuum.

The panel flared once and died.

The corridor dropped into solid black so fast my stomach lurched. I grabbed the ladder.

My flashlight was on my belt. I fumbled it out and clicked it on.

The old admin corridor was still there.

Sort of.

Same beige walls, same brown handrail, same desert print with “COMMUNITY” under it. But the hallway was longer, stretched. More doors than there should’ve been, like someone copy-pasted a few extra. The far end sat too far away.

“What the hell,” I said. Hearing my voice helped.

I climbed down. My boots hit the carpet with no sound.

That, more than anything, made my skin crawl.

I turned to where the elevator lobby should’ve been.

Gone.

Fifteen feet away: a beige wall with a red EXIT door and glowing green sign.

I turned the other way.

Same thing. Red EXIT door. No elevators. No stairwell. Just two outs that hadn’t existed a minute before.

I walked to the nearest door. Through the wired glass, I saw another hallway: same carpet, same doors, fluorescents buzzing.

“Breaker tripped,” I told myself. “Weird re-route. Old prints. Whatever.”

I hit the bar.

The door swung open. When it shut behind me, it sounded thin, like a fridge door.

I turned immediately to wedge it open.

Drywall.

No door. No EXIT sign. Just a blank wall and an empty extinguisher cabinet.

“Nope,” I said. “Nope nope nope.”

The hallway could’ve been any back-of-house corridor. Low-pile carpet, handrails, metal doors: 317, 319, 321. The number plates leaned a little, like whoever stuck them on did it fast.

I tried a handle. Locked. Another. Locked.

The wall clocks were the same cheap black-rimmed model we use, but all of them showed 2:22. Second hands frozen.

My phone still said 2:17.

I hit a T-junction with an overhead sign:

← 300–312
→ 300–312

I picked left.

The smell shifted to faint chlorine, like a drained indoor pool. My footsteps made zero sound. I stomped once; the silence stayed.

“Hello?” I called.

My voice echoed back a half-second late, slightly off-pitch. Like somebody was playing me back on bad speakers.

I kept moving.

The vending machine nook looked almost normal: machine, round table, three stackable chairs, bulletin board with a flyer—SAFETY MEETING WEDNESDAY 2PM – MANDATORY—no date filled in.

Behind the glass: chips, candy, soda. At first glance.

Then the differences: DORITOS → DORIOTS. SNICKERS → SNICKER. Diet Coke → COLA LIGHT. The Lay’s logo with LAYS’S under it.

The keypad was a single row of 0–9 instead of a grid. The bill slot was just featureless black.

The lower panel hung open. Inside, the metal spirals were braided through each other in impossible loops.

On the floor, six candy bars in a perfect circle, wrappers peeled back. The chocolate was scored with straight intersecting lines like a simple wiring diagram.

I stepped back without realizing it until the table bumped my legs.

My phone buzzed.

I jumped hard enough to drop the flashlight. It hit the floor silently.

Banner: LOW BATTERY — 20%. It had been at 60% when I left the shop. I know it had.

Time: 2:17 a.m.

“Okay,” I said. “No. You’re wrong.”

The machine’s hum cut out. The lights above dimmed a notch.

From farther down the hall, I heard a slow drag. Thick fabric on tile. Something heavy pulling itself.

My mouth went desert-dry.

I snatched up the flashlight, flicked it off, then on again by reflex. The beam swung down the corridor.

At the edge of the light, something passed across the hall.

Not a body. An absence. Light darkened where it moved, dimming the fluorescents beyond it. It slid sideways smoothly, then vanished around a corner.

Like a shadow jumping with no person to cast it.

I turned the flashlight off without thinking. Some old lizard bit of my brain shrieked that light made me too visible.

The hum crept back.

I didn’t go see what it was.

I walked the other way.

The corridors kept changing.

I passed through an unmarked doorway and carpet became mottled linoleum; walls turned glossy white; older square fixtures buzzed overhead. Safety posters popped up: WORK SMART, WASH YOUR HANDS, OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR FAMILY, with faces that blurred if I looked too long.

A stretch where every door was CLOSET 1, CLOSET 3, CLOSET 5. All locked.

Around the fifteenth corner I tried marking my path. I slid a torn piece of paper under a door, tied a strip of my blue lanyard around another handle.

Three lefts and a right later, I came to a door with the same lanyard tied on. Same knot. Same frayed ends. Four faint streaks dragged in the paint beside it, ending in neat half-moon erasures.

I left the lanyard. Moving it felt like messing with someone else’s job.

Eventually the hallway blew open into that fake airport.

Ceiling lost in shadow. Big square tiles under me in a pattern that almost looked like a city map. Endless rows of four-seat clusters, vinyl too clean, bolted to the floor.

Gate signs: A1, A3, A5, then B, then AA, AB, AC. Farther letters smeared. Big gray screens overhead glowed blank.

Way across: a wall of glass.

“Outside,” I said. “Has to be.”

I walked toward it.

It never got closer.

No matter how many steps I took, the glass stayed the same distance away. Gate C7 and C8 passed me for the second, third time.

My legs shook. I dropped into a chair. The vinyl didn’t squeak.

Beyond the glass, the world was more of the same—gates, chairs, another glass wall. Like mirrors misaligned.

Then something huge moved across that repetition.

Not a plane. A bulk, a negative space sliding along the concourse beyond. Wherever it went, the gray outside darkened, washed out, then darkened again. The glass vibrated in my spine.

The blank screens glitched. For a second, a line of green pixels tried to spell something—GAT, maybe—but scrambled.

I had to remind myself to breathe.

The thing kept going. No edges, no limbs. Then gone.

I stood up and walked away from the glass.

The restroom was a trap, but not the way you think.

RESTROOMS sign with arrows both ways. I picked one. Beige corridor, heavy door, stick figure with arms bent too high.

Inside, tile, stalls, sinks, mirror. Perfectly clean. No trash, no graffiti.

Seeing myself in the mirror almost felt like waking up. Same tired eyes, same hoodie, same crooked badge.

Then I saw the silhouettes behind me.

Three tall, thin shapes at the far end of the room, in the reflection only. Darker than the rest. No faces. Arms hanging too low.

I didn’t turn around. I just didn’t. Some part of me equated turning with stepping off a roof.

I stared at the mirror and pressed the faucet.

Water arced out. Clear. Real.

In the reflection, it hit the sink and vanished. No splash. No ripple. Just there, then gone.

The silhouettes didn’t move.

I stepped back.

In the mirror, they were closer. One stood right behind my reflection, close enough it could’ve rested its chin on my shoulder if it had a chin.

“Okay,” I whispered.

I stepped forward again. My reflection followed. They stayed.

Up close, the nearest one wasn’t smooth. It was textured, like the side of a building at night. Behind the black, I saw hints of bricks, vents, seams. In its chest, a tiny glowing EXIT sign pulsed backward: TIXE in the glass.

Inside the curve of its shoulder, where bone should’ve been, a miniature hallway ran—carpet, doors, tiny exit signs. Wrong angle to be a reflection of anything behind me.

All the faucets along the sinks were running now. Perfect arcs. No sound.

I turned.

Empty bathroom. Stalls closed. No silhouettes.

The far stall door creaked open. The sound came in torn pieces: squeal, then thump, then hinge noise, all out of order.

That broke me.

I bolted. The door smacked the stopper with a sound my brain refused to process. My shoulder clipped the frame, impact muffled like padding.

Outside, the concourse was gone. Just another low beige hallway.

I didn’t look back.

I found a stairwell next.

Clean green STAIRS sign. Door painted a slightly different beige. It smelled like every hospital stairwell I’ve ever trudged.

Down one flight: landing, big white 3. Down another: 2.

“Good,” I said. “Basement next.”

Down again: 3.

“That’s not funny.”

Back up: 4.

I went up and down, watching the numbers: 3, 2, 3, 4, 2. Different stencil styles, like different people painted them at different times. My heart tried to crawl out of my throat.

I started laughing, high and wrong, the sort of sound you hear yourself make and instantly hate.

“Fine,” I said. “You win.”

I bailed. On the other side of the door, the hall was different. The sign now said STORAGE.

I left stairs alone after that.

Other spaces blurred together: a cafeteria with perfect fake food, fork prongs fused together; a parking level marked P2 where concrete thinned under my foot and the “ceiling” was black glass full of shifting floor plans.

Everywhere I went, I started seeing my own life leaking through. The strip of blue lanyard I’d tied on a door showed up on others. A weird ladder scuff from 3 West reappeared on a wall I’d never seen.

A flyer that used to be blank suddenly had a date written in my handwriting: 10/12.

I don’t remember writing it.

My reflection degraded. Whites of my eyes going gray. Irises losing color. A half-second lag between me and mirror-me. Background sharp, me fuzzy.

My footsteps stayed silent. Clapping sounded like it was happening one floor down.

I don’t think there’s a big moment where something eats you. You just slowly get edited into the background.

The more I saw of the tall things—the Residents—the more they felt like… coworkers.

I watched one “fix” a hallway. Its arm, a cluster of flat pads, pressed to the wall. The surface folded, doors sliding, signs moving, scuffs vanishing. It shifted its hand; the exit sign jumped sides.

It rotated around an axis that shouldn’t exist, and for a second I saw tiny stairwells and waiting rooms inside its chest. Then it was gone, and a red EXIT door glowed where it had been.

It looked exactly like the one outside our mechanical rooms. Same chipped bar, same hinge patina, same scuff in the corner.

Through the glass: St. Alban’s basement. Gray tile, bulletin board with the old Ironman sponsorship flyer Sanchez loves to brag about.

Warm air rolled through the gap.

“If this is real,” I told it, “you’ll have the squeaky tile under the second sprinkler head.”

I hit the bar. The tile on the other side flexed and gave that exact squeaky-wheel feel through my bones.

I laughed, sharp and ugly. “Okay. Maybe…”

I stepped through.

The door shut behind me.

When I spun around, it was just cinderblock and paint. Bulletin board, flyer, blank date. No door. No EXIT.

The boiler roar was gone. The air went flat again.

I slid down the wall and, eventually, pulled my phone.

2:17 a.m. Battery: 18%. Wi-Fi gasping at a bar, then nothing.

I opened Notes.

I’ve walked until my legs ache, sat until my head swims, walked again. Time means nothing. My phone insists it’s still 2:17.

The lobby I’m in now has walls covered in black-and-white photos. Empty streets, overpasses, stairwells, loading docks. No people, no cars. In every photo, somewhere, a door.

I’ve been playing a messed-up Where’s Waldo with them while I type.

One is the old admin corridor. I can see the “COMMUNITY” print and the dent in the baseboard where Kyle dropped a tank and pretended he didn’t. I’m 90% sure it’s the same dent, anyway.

In that picture, the SERVICE door at the end is closed.

There’s a tall, narrow shadow behind the wired glass.

The photo next to it is a stairwell landing with a painted 3. My shadow is there mid-step, blurred, one foot off the ground.

I don’t remember anyone taking it.

My battery icon hasn’t moved. Still 18%. Time still 2:17. The Wi-Fi symbol keeps flashing like it wants to show something, then gives up.

Something’s moving in the corridor outside. That same drag of heavy fabric and deeper groans, like metal under stress. The photos nearest the corner vibrate in their frames.

I don’t think the Residents are hunting me. They’re just… doing whatever their version of a job is. Punching a clock somewhere I can’t see. I’m the glitch.

Feels like everything gets dumped on maintenance eventually, one way or another. Floors, walls, systems… people. We’re the catch-all folder.

If this Note somehow leaks out—if whatever passes for network traffic in here spills into yours—maybe it’ll help someone.

If you work nights, if you’ve ever been last out of a building, if you’ve ever walked down a back hallway and thought it felt a little too long, or the air was too still, listen.

When you see a door you’ve never seen before in a hallway you know by heart, don’t open it “just to see.”

When exit signs point both ways to the same room numbers, turn around. Go toward noise.

If you walk down a corridor and your footsteps don’t make any sound at all, don’t be a hero and take another step “just to see.” Look for your mess: the ladder scuff you made last winter, the coffee stain nobody cleaned, the burned-out bulb you keep meaning to replace. If they’re not there, if everything looks freshly installed and wrong, back up until the world looks worn again.

If you find a vending machine where all the brand names are off by one letter, just keep walking. You don’t need a bag of DORIOTS that badly, I promise.

If you walk into a bathroom and every faucet’s already running and the water doesn’t move when it hits the sink, get out. Don’t check the mirror. Seriously. Just don’t.

And if you ever see a tall, thin shadow at the end of a hallway that your eyes keep sliding off, like a blind spot—

—don’t call out to it for help.

Because it might hear you.

And it might try to help, in the only way it knows how:

by making room.

The air in this lobby is thicker now. The ceiling’s climbed higher; the corners are lost in shadow. Some of the photos have changed—one empty street now has a St. Alban’s sign way in the background.

The hum in the walls is getting deeper. Less HVAC, more construction. Like cranes and concrete shifting somewhere just behind the drywall.

I know a little more now than when I first panicked at that EXIT door. Enough to maybe nudge things for whoever ignores all this and stumbles in anyway. A hallway that doesn’t fold under your feet. An exit sign that actually points somewhere better.

I’ll be the one smoothing walls you never see, pressing too many fingers into the paint and sliding doors a few inches this way or that.

Until then, do me a favor.

Stay in the loud parts of the world. Doors slamming, carts squeaking, somebody complaining the coffee tastes like mud. That’s the good stuff. That means you’re still in the real layers.

And if admitting calls you at 1 a.m. about a flickering light in a wing nobody uses anymore, grab a ladder if you have to.

Just do me one favor and leave the door that says SERVICE alone.

1opcb4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyd_DaTinG/comments/1opcb4x/learned_what_true_intimacy_actually_means/,Learned what true intimacy actually means ❤️,"I guess I’m one of those lucky guys who got a few DMs from girls who were as serious as I am about finding the right partner. I’m still looking for one, but I’ve come a long way.

I started searching for a life partner on my own at the beginning of this year. After posting multiple times here and in the Hyderabad dating sub, I finally got connected with a few wonderful people. We exchanged thoughts and decided to meet in real life.

I met around 2–3 people, and among them was one girl — someone I genuinely thought could be my Shakthi for life. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find the right compatibility and had to let go. Honestly, that was a bit painful.

Until I met her, I had a completely different perspective on intimacy. She came across as a simple Telugu girl — and that simplicity was exactly what I liked about her. From the very first meet, it felt like I’d known her forever, like someone from my own neighbourhood. She was kind enough to meet for long walks and casual street coffee — which soon became part of our little routine.

That’s when I realised what true intimacy really means —
It’s in sharing your secrets, weaknesses, and lows of life, yet still being accepted.
She never judged me, not even once. And I did the same for her. Maybe that’s what made our connection grow faster and deeper.

She also made me realise that sex isn’t real intimacy.
Holding hands and walking is.
Letting someone touch your hair is.
Respecting each other’s values is.
And sometimes, even a simple handshake can feel more meaningful than anything else.

So, dear she,
thank you for making me understand what I should truly look for in love —
what kind of intimacy I should crave,
and what kind of person I should be for my future partner.

Your aura of Shakthi was felt deeply.
I feel blessed to have met someone with that kind of energy — even if it wasn’t meant to last.

The door swung open. When it shut behind me, it sounded thin, like a fridge door.

I turned immediately to wedge it open.

Drywall.

No door. No EXIT sign. Just a blank wall and an empty extinguisher cabinet.

“Nope,” I said. “Nope nope nope.”

The hallway could’ve been any back-of-house corridor. Low-pile carpet, handrails, metal doors: 317, 319, 321. The number plates leaned a little, like whoever stuck them on did it fast.

I tried a handle. Locked. Another. Locked.

The wall clocks were the same cheap black-rimmed model we use, but all of them showed 2:22. Second hands frozen.

My phone still said 2:17.

I hit a T-junction with an overhead sign:

← 300–312
→ 300–312

I picked left.

The smell shifted to faint chlorine, like a drained indoor pool. My footsteps made zero sound. I stomped once; the silence stayed.

“Hello?” I called.

My voice echoed back a half-second late, slightly off-pitch. Like somebody was playing me back on bad speakers.

I kept moving.

The vending machine nook looked almost normal: machine, round table, three stackable chairs, bulletin board with a flyer—SAFETY MEETING WEDNESDAY 2PM – MANDATORY—no date filled in.

Behind the glass: chips, candy, soda. At first glance.

Then the differences: DORITOS → DORIOTS. SNICKERS → SNICKER. Diet Coke → COLA LIGHT. The Lay’s logo with LAYS’S under it.

The keypad was a single row of 0–9 instead of a grid. The bill slot was just featureless black.

The lower panel hung open. Inside, the metal spirals were braided through each other in impossible loops.

On the floor, six candy bars in a perfect circle, wrappers peeled back. The chocolate was scored with straight intersecting lines like a simple wiring diagram.

I stepped back without realizing it until the table bumped my legs.

My phone buzzed.

I jumped hard enough to drop the flashlight. It hit the floor silently.

Banner: LOW BATTERY — 20%. It had been at 60% when I left the shop. I know it had.

Time: 2:17 a.m.

“Okay,” I said. “No. You’re wrong.”

The machine’s hum cut out. The lights above dimmed a notch.

From farther down the hall, I heard a slow drag. Thick fabric on tile. Something heavy pulling itself.

My mouth went desert-dry.

I snatched up the flashlight, flicked it off, then on again by reflex. The beam swung down the corridor.

At the edge of the light, something passed across the hall.

Not a body. An absence. Light darkened where it moved, dimming the fluorescents beyond it. It slid sideways smoothly, then vanished around a corner.

Like a shadow jumping with no person to cast it.

I turned the flashlight off without thinking. Some old lizard bit of my brain shrieked that light made me too visible.

The hum crept back.

I didn’t go see what it was.

I walked the other way.

The corridors kept changing.

I passed through an unmarked doorway and carpet became mottled linoleum; walls turned glossy white; older square fixtures buzzed overhead. Safety posters popped up: WORK SMART, WASH YOUR HANDS, OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR FAMILY, with faces that blurred if I looked too long.

A stretch where every door was CLOSET 1, CLOSET 3, CLOSET 5. All locked.

Around the fifteenth corner I tried marking my path. I slid a torn piece of paper under a door, tied a strip of my blue lanyard around another handle.

Three lefts and a right later, I came to a door with the same lanyard tied on. Same knot. Same frayed ends. Four faint streaks dragged in the paint beside it, ending in neat half-moon erasures.

I left the lanyard. Moving it felt like messing with someone else’s job.

Eventually the hallway blew open into that fake airport.

Ceiling lost in shadow. Big square tiles under me in a pattern that almost looked like a city map. Endless rows of four-seat clusters, vinyl too clean, bolted to the floor.

Gate signs: A1, A3, A5, then B, then AA, AB, AC. Farther letters smeared. Big gray screens overhead glowed blank.

Way across: a wall of glass.

“Outside,” I said. “Has to be.”

I walked toward it.

It never got closer.

No matter how many steps I took, the glass stayed the same distance away. Gate C7 and C8 passed me for the second, third time.

My legs shook. I dropped into a chair. The vinyl didn’t squeak.

Beyond the glass, the world was more of the same—gates, chairs, another glass wall. Like mirrors misaligned.

Then something huge moved across that repetition.

Not a plane. A bulk, a negative space sliding along the concourse beyond. Wherever it went, the gray outside darkened, washed out, then darkened again. The glass vibrated in my spine.

The blank screens glitched. For a second, a line of green pixels tried to spell something—GAT, maybe—but scrambled.

I had to remind myself to breathe.

The thing kept going. No edges, no limbs. Then gone.

I stood up and walked away from the glass.

The restroom was a trap, but not the way you think.

RESTROOMS sign with arrows both ways. I picked one. Beige corridor, heavy door, stick figure with arms bent too high.

Inside, tile, stalls, sinks, mirror. Perfectly clean. No trash, no graffiti.

Seeing myself in the mirror almost felt like waking up. Same tired eyes, same hoodie, same crooked badge.

Then I saw the silhouettes behind me.

Three tall, thin shapes at the far end of the room, in the reflection only. Darker than the rest. No faces. Arms hanging too low.

I didn’t turn around. I just didn’t. Some part of me equated turning with stepping off a roof.

I stared at the mirror and pressed the faucet.

Water arced out. Clear. Real.

In the reflection, it hit the sink and vanished. No splash. No ripple. Just there, then gone.

The silhouettes didn’t move.

I stepped back.

In the mirror, they were closer. One stood right behind my reflection, close enough it could’ve rested its chin on my shoulder if it had a chin.

“Okay,” I whispered.

I stepped forward again. My reflection followed. They stayed.

Up close, the nearest one wasn’t smooth. It was textured, like the side of a building at night. Behind the black, I saw hints of bricks, vents, seams. In its chest, a tiny glowing EXIT sign pulsed backward: TIXE in the glass.

Inside the curve of its shoulder, where bone should’ve been, a miniature hallway ran—carpet, doors, tiny exit signs. Wrong angle to be a reflection of anything behind me.

All the faucets along the sinks were running now. Perfect arcs. No sound.

I turned.

Empty bathroom. Stalls closed. No silhouettes.

The far stall door creaked open. The sound came in torn pieces: squeal, then thump, then hinge noise, all out of order.

That broke me.

I bolted. The door smacked the stopper with a sound my brain refused to process. My shoulder clipped the frame, impact muffled like padding.

Outside, the concourse was gone. Just another low beige hallway.

I didn’t look back.

I found a stairwell next.

Clean green STAIRS sign. Door painted a slightly different beige. It smelled like every hospital stairwell I’ve ever trudged.

Down one flight: landing, big white 3. Down another: 2.

“Good,” I said. “Basement next.”

Down again: 3.

“That’s not funny.”

Back up: 4.

I went up and down, watching the numbers: 3, 2, 3, 4, 2. Different stencil styles, like different people painted them at different times. My heart tried to crawl out of my throat.

I started laughing, high and wrong, the sort of sound you hear yourself make and instantly hate.

“Fine,” I said. “You win.”

I bailed. On the other side of the door, the hall was different. The sign now said STORAGE.

I left stairs alone after that.

Other spaces blurred together: a cafeteria with perfect fake food, fork prongs fused together; a parking level marked P2 where concrete thinned under my foot and the “ceiling” was black glass full of shifting floor plans.

Everywhere I went, I started seeing my own life leaking through. The strip of blue lanyard I’d tied on a door showed up on others. A weird ladder scuff from 3 West reappeared on a wall I’d never seen.

A flyer that used to be blank suddenly had a date written in my handwriting: 10/12.

I don’t remember writing it.

My reflection degraded. Whites of my eyes going gray. Irises losing color. A half-second lag between me and mirror-me. Background sharp, me fuzzy.

My footsteps stayed silent. Clapping sounded like it was happening one floor down.

I don’t think there’s a big moment where something eats you. You just slowly get edited into the background.

The more I saw of the tall things—the Residents—the more they felt like… coworkers.

I watched one “fix” a hallway. Its arm, a cluster of flat pads, pressed to the wall. The surface folded, doors sliding, signs moving, scuffs vanishing. It shifted its hand; the exit sign jumped sides.

It rotated around an axis that shouldn’t exist, and for a second I saw tiny stairwells and waiting rooms inside its chest. Then it was gone, and a red EXIT door glowed where it had been.

It looked exactly like the one outside our mechanical rooms. Same chipped bar, same hinge patina, same scuff in the corner.

Through the glass: St. Alban’s basement. Gray tile, bulletin board with the old Ironman sponsorship flyer Sanchez loves to brag about.

Warm air rolled through the gap.

“If this is real,” I told it, “you’ll have the squeaky tile under the second sprinkler head.”

I hit the bar. The tile on the other side flexed and gave that exact squeaky-wheel feel through my bones.

I laughed, sharp and ugly. “Okay. Maybe…”

I stepped through.

The door shut behind me.

When I spun around, it was just cinderblock and paint. Bulletin board, flyer, blank date. No door. No EXIT.

The boiler roar was gone. The air went flat again.

I slid down the wall and, eventually, pulled my phone.

2:17 a.m. Battery: 18%. Wi-Fi gasping at a bar, then nothing.

I opened Notes.

I’ve walked until my legs ache, sat until my head swims, walked again. Time means nothing. My phone insists it’s still 2:17.

The lobby I’m in now has walls covered in black-and-white photos. Empty streets, overpasses, stairwells, loading docks. No people, no cars. In every photo, somewhere, a door.

I’ve been playing a messed-up Where’s Waldo with them while I type.

One is the old admin corridor. I can see the “COMMUNITY” print and the dent in the baseboard where Kyle dropped a tank and pretended he didn’t. I’m 90% sure it’s the same dent, anyway.

In that picture, the SERVICE door at the end is closed.

There’s a tall, narrow shadow behind the wired glass.

The photo next to it is a stairwell landing with a painted 3. My shadow is there mid-step, blurred, one foot off the ground.

I don’t remember anyone taking it.

My battery icon hasn’t moved. Still 18%. Time still 2:17. The Wi-Fi symbol keeps flashing like it wants to show something, then gives up.

Something’s moving in the corridor outside. That same drag of heavy fabric and deeper groans, like metal under stress. The photos nearest the corner vibrate in their frames.

I don’t think the Residents are hunting me. They’re just… doing whatever their version of a job is. Punching a clock somewhere I can’t see. I’m the glitch.

Feels like everything gets dumped on maintenance eventually, one way or another. Floors, walls, systems… people. We’re the catch-all folder.

If this Note somehow leaks out—if whatever passes for network traffic in here spills into yours—maybe it’ll help someone.

If you work nights, if you’ve ever been last out of a building, if you’ve ever walked down a back hallway and thought it felt a little too long, or the air was too still, listen.

When you see a door you’ve never seen before in a hallway you know by heart, don’t open it “just to see.”

When exit signs point both ways to the same room numbers, turn around. Go toward noise.

If you walk down a corridor and your footsteps don’t make any sound at all, don’t be a hero and take another step “just to see.” Look for your mess: the ladder scuff you made last winter, the coffee stain nobody cleaned, the burned-out bulb you keep meaning to replace. If they’re not there, if everything looks freshly installed and wrong, back up until the world looks worn again.

If you find a vending machine where all the brand names are off by one letter, just keep walking. You don’t need a bag of DORIOTS that badly, I promise.

If you walk into a bathroom and every faucet’s already running and the water doesn’t move when it hits the sink, get out. Don’t check the mirror. Seriously. Just don’t.

And if you ever see a tall, thin shadow at the end of a hallway that your eyes keep sliding off, like a blind spot—

—don’t call out to it for help.

Because it might hear you.

And it might try to help, in the only way it knows how:

by making room.

The air in this lobby is thicker now. The ceiling’s climbed higher; the corners are lost in shadow. Some of the photos have changed—one empty street now has a St. Alban’s sign way in the background.

The hum in the walls is getting deeper. Less HVAC, more construction. Like cranes and concrete shifting somewhere just behind the drywall.

I know a little more now than when I first panicked at that EXIT door. Enough to maybe nudge things for whoever ignores all this and stumbles in anyway. A hallway that doesn’t fold under your feet. An exit sign that actually points somewhere better.

I’ll be the one smoothing walls you never see, pressing too many fingers into the paint and sliding doors a few inches this way or that.

Until then, do me a favor.

Stay in the loud parts of the world. Doors slamming, carts squeaking, somebody complaining the coffee tastes like mud. That’s the good stuff. That means you’re still in the real layers.

And if admitting calls you at 1 a.m. about a flickering light in a wing nobody uses anymore, grab a ladder if you have to.

Just do me one favor and leave the door that says SERVICE alone.
Let the headache light flicker. You can live with that.",1,1762370291.0,scaryjujuarmy,0,1.0,False

1opc84q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1opc84q/aio_or_was_my_boss_kindacrazy/,AIO or was my boss kinda…crazy.,"GOSH where to start…
(context): I’m 23F and my coworkers were all 50. Now, for several months I worked at a very small beachy type bakery. Small as in 38 max people inside at any given time, excruciatingly slow in the winter and somewhat busy in the summer.  And even though it was somewhat small i deeply enjoyed working there. I absolutely adored the customers, being on first name basis with most of the regulars, knowing what they like, and knowing just what’s going on in their lives. The location of this bakery is in a retirement type community, so it’s mostly older folks. 
So the boss (miss crazy)… the entire time I worked there I was walking on egg shells. She once accused an employee of stealing toilet paper, so she could fire her… Like lots of really not ok stuff and definitely many, many violations (one example is after a visit from the health inspector miss crazy told me i should’ve lied about the shed in the back, that has food? 🧐 hm?) the most DIABOLICAL thing is using drip beans as espresso for the lattes. Disgusting and diabolical. The last piece of context i’m going to give, is she told a former employee that she likes the environment to be “high stress” so we don’t talk to eachother out of work. 

Now here’s a bit of my own lore and context… I struggle a bit, i’ve struggled with an eating disorder, depression, anxiety and PTSD (super fun combo). And I absolutely have been to treatment for it, once or twice (three times). But even though I struggle with this, I am a functional and capable person, I get anxious now? cool I step out for a second and use the skills I’ve learned and fix it and go back in. And at the time of working at this bakery I had such a good handle on it all. I was incredibly proud. 

Then came October. The very end of our busy season, so at this point i was able to get sandwiches and coffees out the door when staffed properly. At the start of October, miss crazy, fired a higher up who was the woman who trained  me (let’s call her miss G). And she LIED about why she fired her. She said “other employees have been complaining that you make this a hostile and mean work environment” (i was gagged). Then that sweet employee miss G, smelt BS and sat down with miss crazy and a separate employee who miss crazy said was saying those things. Well shock, miss crazy lied. The employee just said “i’d never say those things about miss G” because miss G was the best. She did so much for Miss crazy, like giving miss crazy her own  cheesecake recipe, doing all the baking for miss crazy, and essentially running the bakery. 

After that Miss crazy hired another lady, whom her favorite employee didn’t like and she said “she’s a widow with three kids” (Miss R). Then Miss Rs back hurt after her second shift there and…. miss crazy FIRED HER. YES FIRED HER. Evil work, and all because she asked someone else to vacuum… Like i’m not even joking around, she fired her because she asked someone else to vacuum because her back hurt…
You know what I did? I started applying to new jobs that’s what I did.  
Well it was a damn good move. It was sad, because i loved the customers. That’s it, I deeply cared for a few who are older folks, widowed, or divorced, living on their own in their 70’s. That is and was the saddest part. I did not like miss crazy at all, or my other coworker who was miss crazy’s favorite (because she likes to gossip and is a b word) 

So, now i’m applying for new jobs, and boom right away got a training date. 
Now, i go in, the day before I’m supposed to train at this new place. And of freaking course at the end of the day (after i’m done cleaning everything obviously) miss crazy pulls me to the back and tells me to sit down. I immediately say “are you firing me?” and contemplate just walking out but she hits me with “well i’m letting you go but please have a seat” 
I should’ve walked out.
I sat down. 

Miss crazy: “I feel really bad about this, you’re so sweet and work hard. But i feel bad having you work here.” 
me: “what do you mean”
Miss crazy: “Well you get so anxious here and cry in your car and i just feel so bad” 
Me: “You mean when i cried once in august?” (YES, sue me i cried once. We had three working (which we needed) on a very busy summer day. She pulled one lady to the back to bake, and left me and another person at the front when we were swarmed by tourists on their beach trips wanting coffee and sandwiches. So yes I cried, but i’ve been in treatment and struggled with anxiety for 10 years now so when i say i took care of it. I took care of it, I grabbed Miss G back to the front said I needed 5, washed my face and went back out there in FIVE minutes.) 

She then went on to tell me I should seek out a counselor and consider a different career path (she’s a damn comedian) . She told me I could take a free bottle of wine, so with everything i can, I don’t cry, I stay civil and grab the most expensive bottle of wine. I did cry the rest of the night though, but honestly, handled it like a champ. Miss crazy terrified me, and i mean terrified me, she was like my high school bully, just an all around awful person. A customer even once asked me if she was mentally ill. I wish I was joking. 

This entire thing has been somewhat not great for my anxiety or my eating disorder, those two really work hand in hand. And I know I shouldn’t have taken it as hard as I did, but the constant anxiety I had whenever miss crazy would walk into a room out of fear she’d say some snarky mean comment was so bad, and so exhausting. And has had lasting effects even being out of there. 

I think i’m really just looking for some validation, in the sense that, i’m not crazy, but the conditions she put her employees though, and what she would say and do, are what’s crazy. Am I overreacting or is that just a beyond bizarre work environment? 

(i did get that other job 🤭 and the people i now work with are around my age (yay friends!) and the boss is so nice, and everyone there is friends outside of work))

1opc6ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1opc6ek/grinder_advice_needed_300800/,Grinder Advice Needed [$300-$800],"Hello I have decided to purchase an espresso setup. I have seen the trends that investing in a decent grinder as opposed to an all in one machine is worth it. Location is USA. Preferred drink types would be flat white and cortado. Medium-Dark roasts. 2-4 drinks per day usually. Will be our first at-home setup, but have been in restaurants a while and have used professional/commercial equipment. 

I have seen the usual DF64, Niche Zero/Duo, and Baratza Encore ESP Pro. We would like to be able to do espresso and other grinds like drip coffee. Some of my questions are; 
Does conical vs flat burr really matter that much? Off initial research is sounds like conical is what I’d want for a better “body”. I was leaning DF64 but some things say flat burr is worse for the medium/darker roasts. Was also considering adding the SSP Lab Sweet burrs on MiiCoffee if purchasing the DF64 to help with the issue. Don’t know too much on that so advice is welcome. 
Which of the above is good at both filter and espresso grinds? Is there one? Seems niche struggles with grinding drip. 
I think Niche would be my top price I’m willing to go for the grinder, but it’s gotta be worth it. Open to suggestions/ideas. Thanks. ",1,1762370066.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1opc0c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1opc0c0/ive_been_watching_you_my_love/,I’ve been watching you my love.,"I lay in your warm room, allowing my mind to wander, thinking back on all the good times I’ve had with you. I sit in this room, studying all the things making you, you. Staring into the piles of stuffed animals, coffee pods stacked high, and books stacked even higher (seriously, how do you read all of these?), I think back to when we first came into contact. We passed by, something she probably has no memory of. You were a knee high girl, 5-7 at most, waltzing through the isles. A few weeks later, I couldn’t get you out of my mind. It was the first time I broke into your room. You still have the stuffed animals (your favorite is a pig named Polly) but everything else has changed. Your princess dresses changed to crop tops and leggings. Your long blonde hair usually smelled like watermelon then, but now it’s scented like the sweetest cherries, matching the cute little socks you have. Your skin used to be blotted with pimples, scratches, and deep wounds you wanted no one else to see. Those nights were the hardest, hearing you cry out into the pillow but not being able to hold my little girl. Now, you’re twenty years old, leaving dear old dad and mom safely at home, promising to be good at school. Of course you will be, I’ve been watching. After any man left, I followed, confronting once we got far enough away. Throwing stuff towards the window, making sure my girl maintained a PG-13 rating anytime some disgusting boy wanted to make things X rated. You really should thank me, you don’t know how much I've done for you. I’ve waited fifteen years to meet you. 

It’s a chilly saturday night, almost a week later and I’m in the midst of my newest masterpiece, sawing off the buttocks of this girl. She’s not my girl, but close enough. The girl in front of me, I think her name is Maeve, is silent, but the chloroform is going to wear off soon. She was one of my girl’s friends. I need to finish before that happens, I cannot have her wake up. She is the only one who knew about me. I wanted to be normal, I swear. I promise I grew up just like you. I watched Saturday morning cartoons, ate sweet bowls of fruity pebbles, and played with my friends in the creek after school. I used to be normal. This obsession with this girl just… overtook me. I started watching her when she was in elementary school. She passed me in the store, said she was sorry, and moved on with her life. She probably didn’t even remember it by the end of her life. Stephanie was a gorgeous blonde girl with mocha brown eyes. She loves the color purple and tries to seem put together, but she cries into her stuffed pig that she’s had since she was a baby. She liked to wear sweater dresses and low-rise jeans to seem different from other girls her age. Her hair was long, falling to the middle of her back in small ringlets. I love remembering what my baby looks like. Well, now it would be looked like I suppose. I left her room splattered in her dark red innards, no matter how hard I tried to maintain her precious figure. Stephanie had started to realize too much and decided to squeal to Maeve about her “problem”. Kind of rude to imply that I’m a problem when I do nothing but keep her safe, but whatever. Unfortunately, seeing as Maeve tried to protect her friend, it means that her time is over. The chloroform wore off now and Maeve is waking up. I’m only halfway through, she needs to shut the fuck up. I clasp my hand over her mouth, whispering in her ear that the more she keeps screaming, the more this is going to hurt. I lean over, grabbing the gag I had used when I grabbed her from the dorm room. These college girls go to get an education, but some of them are just so dense. Really, you think the man who “fell over” while putting something in his car needs help getting up? I’m only 45, I’m not that old. She keeps screaming, refusing to stop. I slam my fist into her face, feeling the bones turning to mush below me. This part always makes me nauseous, but when bitches can’t learn their place, you do what has to be done. Women loved me when I was in college, they used to flock to me. These new-aged women have no idea what they’re avoiding. All these dirty looks they give, the grimace as I pass them, everything they choose to do in those disgusting clubs. My baby never did that, she would never give me a look like that. Even when she saw me in her room after she got out of the shower, the delicious cherry smell followed her throughout the apartment. She didn’t give me any ounce of disgust in that precious face. Even when she saw the knife I branded, she refused to scrunch up the cute button nose adorning her face. She just got that confused look on her face, the one that makes me see her like a little bunny. Now that Maeve made her fatal mistake, she is going to need to be moved.

As I round the corner, I see two policemen having a conversation. I’m on my way back to my apartment, trying to avoid the very people standing outside of my apartment. I had a handful of things left in there, but that’s okay. I lean against the wall, trying to listen in. 

“So, you really think this guy went out of his way to do this?” The police man says. He has dark brown hair and a long, lanky figure. His voice is younger and easily excitable, seemingly new to the job. 
 “I don’t know, it’s really odd. I don’t see this random guy with no history of crime harming like this…” This officer is a little bigger, his weight being distributed more in his stomach. His voice is deep, withered with age. 
“I mean, haven’t we seen this before? There's gotta be a different case. Have you been on a case like this?” 
“Sadly Thomas, I’ve been in this field for so long that I don’t think I’ll come across a case I haven’t seen before. Usually, it’s a family member doing something this violent.”
“I don’t think that it was family, I think it was her ex boyfriend. I wish I had gotten to see it, for the experience, ya kn-”
“No, Thomas, you don’t.” The older man cuts him off, going back to banging on my door, expecting a response. 
“Barry, this guy probably didn’t even do it. We’ve been banging on this door for twenty minutes. No one is going to come out.”
“Then we’re going in.”
The door gets kicked open and I decide to make my move to leave then. They begin searching my apartment, and as I turn away I hear gagging noises. 
“Barry, oh my god! How long has she been here, what do we do?” 
“Go call the sheriff, now. We need backup, take a deep breath.” 
“I-I don’t know what to do.” 
I hear the older man pick up his phone, so I make my run for it. I leave the apartment building through the back door, where I know the cameras don’t work. I make my way towards the next spot, changing my clothes halfway through. I slip the blue jeans over my muscular frame, pulling my new red sweater over top of my arms. The cop cars begin flying down the road towards my old apartment, as I make my way down to a new life. I take a moment, thinking about everything that got me here. I think of the blood splattering her purple light, the fear permanently etched into her face as I brought the knife down over and over and over again. My hands shake, remembering the soft pink pig that was laying in her bed. I think of the smell of that delicious cherry shampoo, the one that peppered her body in her last moments.  I’m lost in thought when a conversation right outside my hideout begins taking place. 
“Dude, did you hear what was found last weekend?”
“No, what happened?”
“They found this girl totally butchered in her apartment. She was only 20. Her insides were on the outside.”
“Oh my god, that’s disgusting dude. Have they found him yet? 
I decide to play this for laughs, coming around the corner. 
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but what are you talking about?”
They eye me up and down, looking really confused. The taller man was grossed out by the conversation, seeming upset at my appearance. They were about the same age as her, probably 21 at most. The short man looked very excited to get to explain the tale again. As he begins to describe my crime, I laugh.
“I don’t think they’ll find him. He’s probably halfway across the country by now. There’s no chance he’d stick around.” 
I start to walk away, laughing to myself and thinking about how lucky they’ll feel if I ever manage to get caught.

1opbzc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckNestle/comments/1opbzc9/we_should_narrow_the_scope_of_boycotting_to/,We should narrow the scope of boycotting to Nestle's most lucrative product category,"Boycotting all 2000 brands under Nestle is not impossible, but INCREDIBLY daunting and difficult. It'll require everyone to check nearly every single product you come across when buying groceries, which for the average consumer might be a tall ask for most. I did a bit of research, and although it may be common knowledge to most of you here, but their biggest money-making product segment is Powdered and liquid beverages, not including water. Such brands like Nescafe, Nestea, Nespresso.

[https://medium.com/better-marketing/nestl%C3%A9s-best-selling-product-is-not-chocolate-a670ab71db99](https://medium.com/better-marketing/nestl%C3%A9s-best-selling-product-is-not-chocolate-a670ab71db99)

The idea is if we can hone in on these specific lucrative products as a starting point for a mass targeted boycott, we may actually be able to put a dent in their revenues. Especially since it'll be easier to track.

I started a boycott Spotify campaign and since their revenue comes largely from their premium subscriptions, it's easy to measure the financial impact when each individual boycotts (1 boycotter= $11.99/month of lost revenue) We have 150 supporters thus far, and that equates to about $1800/month in lost revenue. Not much yet, but the goal is to get hundreds of thousands of supporters. I'm just imagining if it reaches 1 Million supporters, that's 12 million in lost revenue per month!

I think we can replicate that, an example would be to initiate a Nespresso boycott, and their 40ct pod pack is around $36 on Walmart. [https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nespresso-Capsules-OriginalLine-Ispirazione-Ristretto-Italiano-Dark-Roast-Espresso-Coffee-40-Count-Espresso-Pods-Brews-1-35oz/204024448?classType=VARIANT](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nespresso-Capsules-OriginalLine-Ispirazione-Ristretto-Italiano-Dark-Roast-Espresso-Coffee-40-Count-Espresso-Pods-Brews-1-35oz/204024448?classType=VARIANT)

For estimating purposes, if an individual drinks one pod per day on average, that'll come out to about $36 per month on a recurring basis. If the campaign spreads and gains millions of boycotters, I can't imagine it not affecting their revenues. If we can mobilize around just Nespresso, I think it'll be much easier for it catch on, especially since there'll be viable alternatives. This can really become an actionable campaign, not only for us who are passionate about fucking Nestle.

Halloween outing that lasted til 3 am. Everyone was tired from early morning travel and sore from walking, and one was in pain because she needed to pump milk and hadn't pumped in 8 hours, but we all wanted to let bride enjoy event. 

A MOH dominating food outings due to dietary choices (Not restrictions. Choices)

A gorgeous hotel where dinner would have made sense and tasted delicious.And many close options nearby.  Instead we walked to dinner across town. 

Another dinner that should have been $70 Prix Fix. Was over $100. 

One friend group speed walking through Manhattan and leaving the other behind with no awareness whatsoever and annoyance when asked to slow down. Happened multiple times.

Tons of Subway rides that could have been Ubers (A few practical subway rides? FINE!)

Itinerary Friday had no time to eat lunch, nor did Saturday's

Itinerary had 9 am wake-ups after very late nights out. Asked to sleep to 9:45, bride said that ""made her nervous

Even something as small as me going to a coffee shop not on the itinerary got me a weird look from bride.

I’m 41, from Austin, Texas, and between work, kids, and trying to stay on top of everything, I figured fatigue was just part of being an adult. But then I started noticing more than just tiredness — my stomach always felt bloated, my skin looked dull, and I just couldn’t lose a single pound no matter what I ate or how much I walked.

I tried all the typical things: cutting carbs, drinking more water, even doing those three-day juice “cleanses.” They helped a bit, but within a week, I was back to feeling sluggish again. My clothes felt tight around my middle, and I started feeling frustrated and honestly, a little defeated.

One afternoon, my coworker, Rachel, mentioned she’d been feeling the same way — low energy, constant bloating, mood swings. She told me she’d learned that sometimes the problem isn’t your diet or metabolism… it’s your liver not keeping up. I didn’t really believe her at first. I thought liver issues were for heavy drinkers or people with medical conditions, not someone like me.

But she insisted I look into it, and that night I went down the Google rabbit hole. The more I read, the more it made sense — your liver is like your body’s filter, and if it’s overwhelmed, everything else slows down. That’s when I came across something that focused specifically on supporting healthy liver function and natural fat metabolism.

I started taking it with zero expectations, but within a week or so, I began to feel… lighter. Not just physically, but mentally too. My mornings didn’t feel so heavy anymore. I woke up with actual energy instead of dragging myself to the coffee maker. After a few more weeks, that stubborn bloating finally started to go away, and I noticed my jeans fitting better again.

The biggest change, though, wasn’t the physical stuff — it was how clear-headed I started to feel. My mood improved, my skin looked fresher, and that tired, weighed-down feeling I’d been living with for years just started to fade.

I wasn’t doing anything crazy — same food, same routine — but everything felt different. When my husband noticed and asked what changed, I told him about HepatoBurn. I said, “I think my liver finally got the support it needed.”

Now, months later, I still feel steady and energized. I don’t crash midday, I don’t wake up groggy, and I finally feel comfortable in my own body again.

If you’ve been stuck in that constant cycle of tiredness, bloating, and frustration, it might not be your diet — it might be your body trying to tell you it needs a reset. Supporting your liver might just be the quiet fix you didn’t know you needed.",1,1762369600.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

I made chole chawal today, finished some design improvements, and later brewed myself a really good cup of coffee. After a long shower, I stepped outside and looked at the moon. Somehow, it made me feel peaceful from the inside.

After preparing the meal, I decorated my table with a bit of food aesthetics, and when I clicked a picture of it, I started thinking about you. For a moment, I wanted to send it to you. But I didn’t.

I still miss you. I miss talking to you, sharing the little details of my day, listening to yours, and just talking nonsense for hours. It’s strange how something that felt so lovely and warm could end so suddenly. How could something so beautiful just stop existing?

Then the anxiety hits again, that tightening in my chest like my ribs are shrinking and I can’t breathe. It feels exactly like that day when you told me why we shouldn’t be together. You said I was a great guy but not your type. That you needed someone with more ambition, abs, and personality.

A good and kind human with a decent voice, that’s me. And I guess that’s all I have to offer.

After the call ended, I covered my face with a pillow and cried. I looked horrible, but I couldn’t stop. My head felt heavy, so I went to the kitchen, washed the dishes, and tried to find a funny reel on Instagram, hoping to laugh at something, anything. But I couldn’t. The pain was louder.

A couple of days later, I realised I had forgotten to wish my mom on her birthday. It was the same day we stopped talking. I felt like a soulless human, just moving through the day without purpose.

I already have enough problems in my life, and maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be. Somehow, they’ll take the space you once filled. Cheers to adulthood!",1,1762369295.0,TwentiesIndia,2,1.0,False

**St. Paisius of Mount Athos on the fight against ""garbage"" in the head. How the ""scissor method"" and humility help to overcome the information noise and find the peace of Christ.**



The series of dialogues with saints and elders continues. And today our guest is the illustrious confessor from Mount Athos, St. Paisios. The saint's words and letters remain relevant at all times. He is practically our contemporary, which means that the problems and spiritual needs that we face in everyday life are well known to him.



Today we will talk with the elder about how a Christian should live in the era of digitalization. But first, a few lines about Geronda's life story.

  
**Our interlocutor is Elder Paisios**

Elder Paisios (in the world Arsenios Eznepidis, 1924-1994) was one of the greatest and most revered Athonite ascetics of the 20th century.



Born in Cappadocia (Asia Minor) and serving as a radio operator in the Greek army, he chose the monastic path, asceticizing on Mount Athos, in the monasteries of Esphigmenos, Philotheos and, finally, in his famous cell ""Panaguda"".

  
Without being a priest, Elder Paisius became a spiritual father to thousands of people from all over the world.



Hundreds of pilgrims – workers, students, hierarchs, and scientists - flocked to his modest cell every day.



Possessing the greatest gift of prudence, love and foresight, he gave simple but deeply accurate answers to the most difficult questions of modern man. His instructions, collected in six volumes of ""Words,"" are not a dry theory, but the living experience of a man who has acquired the true holiness and peace of Christ. In 2015, St. Paisius was canonized.



**""Heads are overloaded with junk"": the danger of digital noise**

In an era of continuous information flow – news, social networks, aggressive advertising – a person loses the most valuable thing: inner peace. When we wake up in the morning, the first thing we pick up is not a prayer book, but a smartphone. And there are endless chats, work tasks, weather forecast, flashing tabloid headlines...



While we're looking at all this, it's getting close to the beginning of the working day, and the prayer book continues to gather dust on the shelf.



""I'll pray on the way to work,"" the naive mind convinces us, but in reality everything happens quite differently. Shop's windows, advertising banners, marketplace promotions, morning coffee in a hurry... What kind of prayer spirit is there? Work, business, household routine... And at the end of the day, when our strength is already running out, we reproach ourselves for not being able to say even a short Jesus prayer in this rush.



Elder Paisius, although he lived without the Internet, perfectly saw and described the state of a person overloaded with unnecessary information. He warned that such a life makes us nervous, distracted and vulnerable to the main enemy – thoughts.



>*""Previously, people had the opportunity to have a good disposition, their thoughts were occupied with kindness. But today everyone has become nervous and can't come to their senses. People have filled their heads with garbage. They don't want to listen to anything spiritual because their heads are overloaded with worldly, worthless junk,"" - the elder laments.*



Geronda reminds us that the main battle of a Christian does not take place on the outside field, but inside it – in the mind and heart. And the main opponent in this battle is thoughts, which, like computer viruses, steal our joy and faith.



**The ""Scissor Method"": how to cut off virus thoughts**

Software developers spend months and years trying to come up with ""antidotes"" for various ""infections"" that get into gadgets from the World Wide Web. A person is harmed by ""viruses"" of toxic information entering his mind. In such cases, many people run to psychologists with a lot of money to free their heads from the increasing overload.



Abba Paisius offers us a free method of ""digital detoxification"", which can be called the ""scissors method"".



>*""You should not argue with the thought, but you should cut it off,"" the elder instructs. ""If you argue with him, he'll be messing with you."" He will tell you, “I'm right!“and you said, ""I'm right!”and so you will waste time, and another thought will come, and you will have to argue again, and this will continue without end. Therefore, the thought must be immediately cut off.""*



The basis of Elder Paisius' spiritual ""antivirus"" is the skill of cutting off thoughts at the moment when they are just born or come from outside. If you let it grow, it will turn into a passion.



This method is especially important when we read the news or come across judgmental information. With spiritual ""scissors"" or even more – with a spiritual ""scalpel"" we will mercilessly cut out all the suppuration in the soul caused by toxic ""messages"".



By not allowing thoughts to develop, we preserve inner peace. According to the elder, even if thoughts come, they should not ""find a hotel in us,"" that is, they should not be gently accepted and developed.



But what if an impure thought has penetrated inside?



>*""Do not argue and immediately turn to God,– the Abba instructs. – After all, arguing with the idea is like trying to stop a sea storm. It's better to step back right away and ask for help from above.""*

 



**The main weapon is the ""spiritual vaccine"" of humility**

How can we counteract the barrage of information that overwhelms us every day? Elder Paisius is sure that the most powerful weapon against negative thoughts, especially pride and condemnation, is not external struggle, but inner humility, expressed in self–condemnation. This is the spiritual ""vaccine"" that makes the soul immune to temptation.



>*""Do you know what the best defense is? When a person condemns himself. Then you don't need any fortress. If you judge yourself, then the enemy does not have access to you and cannot confuse you with thoughts,"" Geronda convinces.*



Indeed, being overly involved in the mental consumption of other people's news, we forget to regularly view the ""news feed"" of our soul. And there we can find a lot of ""interesting things"": from small thoughts of malice to resolute intentions to fall into some serious sin.



Elder Paisius strictly warns us against such carelessness:



>*""We should be busy with our own spiritual trash and not look at the trash of others. Those who constantly look at other people's sins will never see their own. And if he doesn't see his own people, he won't repent.""* 

>

**How to find the peace of Christ in the hustle and bustle**

At the first meeting with us, St. Paisius gave spiritual advice, which can be safely called the basic principles of ""digital asceticism."" He does not urge all lay people to become hermits, but recommends finding inner peace and joy in the midst of worldly bustle. This peace is a sign of victory over informational and spiritual noise.



It remains a small matter: resolutely ""cutting"" thoughts, reproaching ourselves for being relaxed and asking God for help. This is the ""spiritual antivirus"" of St. Paisius. We are looking forward to another soul-saving meeting with Abba, and today he accompanies us with such parting words:



>*""The goal of spiritual achievement is to come to a peaceful state so that Christ reigns in the soul. When there is peace in the soul, then a person rejoices, despite any difficulties and temptations.""*",2,1762369253.0,SophiaWisdomOfGod,0,1.0,False

I am researching a new espresso machine. Current one was an illy Francis Francis X1, but it broke, so I need to either pay to fix, or buy something new. I would ideally spend around $1000 - $1500 for a new machine, but can reach around $2000 if there is enough benefit / reason.

Current grinder: Baratza - Vario, same model as this one: [https://corainc.com/products/baratza-coffee-grinder-vario?variant=8176520200237](https://corainc.com/products/baratza-coffee-grinder-vario?variant=8176520200237)

Location: USA

Planned uses:  Mainly Americanos, with occasional Lattes

Number of Shots: 2-3 daily

Occasional guests where 4+ shots and milk frothing

Milk frothing: 1-2 per week

Space limitations: nice to have a lower profile, but have some counter space available

Experience: Used Francis X1 for 10+ years, time to have additional options

Beans: Usually locally roasted Dark espresso both Caf and Decaf, with occasional medium roasts.

I am considering a single boiler with heat exchange for quicker frothing, but not limited to this. Will use a separate water heater, so hot water from machine not needed.

Wants:

1. Adjustable PID - I use a wide range of grinds: Dark, light, decaf, etc
2. Able to occasionally adjust pressure (nice to have)
3. Ease of cleaning: Empty boiler (descale if needed), easy access for watch tank and drip catcher.
4. Durability / ease of repair (available parts too)
5. Heat up time under 15-20 minutes (or has a schedule timer for preheat)

Models under consideration (please recommend additional or advise against some):

1. ECM Classika - $1600 (possible to get \~$1100 used with 6 month warranty - 3 years old)
2. Profitec GO - $1200
3. Manus.S - $1300
4. Rancilio Silvia Pro X - $2200 (would look for sale or used)
5. Bezzera Aria PID - $2200 (would look for sale or used)
6. Profitec move - $2250 (would look for sale or used)

What are your thoughts and recommendations? I plan watch for Black Friday sales and want to have the top 3 to keep my eyes on.

I've developed what I believe is a highly scientific drink in the morning that will reshape your life.  This was in response to what was undesired changes in my body driven by genetics.

Why not run an experiment and ramp to my same drink?  (Do NOT do overnight as your system cannot handle it, and you will end up in the hospital.)  It will not help overnight, but I believe that you will see fundamental changes in six months, and life changing effects in 12 months.

I started this approach, and my wife joined later.  I improve poor genetics, and she increased an already remarkable genetic base.

Here is the routine:

**Rehydrate alternating day approach: Approximately 2 liters**

* Day:  Green tea (1300ml) and pomegranate juice if a male (220 ml)
* Alt Day: Coffee (700ml weak) and Milk (220 ml) and 28 grams sucrose
* One can of V8 every day (350 ml)
* 280 ml water for base of protein

**Protein: Approximately 50 grams**

* Whey 20 grams (wife is lower)
* Casein 20 grams (wife is lower)
* Collagen 3 grams (but wife takes 12 grams primary to help on bones)
* Plus protein in V8 (3 grams) and alternative day milk (7 grams)

**Fiber Mixture: Approximately 45 grams**

* 25 grams psyllium, see comments for lead concerns
* 10 grams inulin
* 7 grams beta-glucan
* 2 grams glucomannan
* 1 gram potato resistant starch

**Co-factors with the whey:**

* Creatine 5 grams
* MSM (methylsulfonylmethane)
* Grape Seed Powder
* Beta Alanine
* HBM (hydroxymethylbutyrate)
* Four drops of 357 hot sauce (just highly concentrated capsaicin)

**Methodology:**

Prep by preparing up to two weeks of containers filled first with fiber on bottom and protein  and other factors on top.  This is to prevent the fiber from turning into solid mass.

Find adequate wide container and mix with hand held mixture as breakfast.

Drink immediately as it will turn into almost solid mass if left too long.

I found out with this as my breakfast, I could go through dinner without need of other food, or it cut the amount that I would eat for business lunches.

**Second is a number from a year ago** \- After 3 months of keto, without  a statin. I quit keto at that point.   
**Third number is today -** Two months into keto, with the statin. I have lost 17 lbs since then and am continuing to lose weight at a nice clip. 

  
CHOL (mg/dL): 214 / 320 / 255  
TRIG (mg/dL): 155 / 159 / 237  
HDL (mg/dL): 50 / 50 / 37  
LDLC (ratio): 133 / 239 / 170  
VLDLC (ratio): 31 / 32 / 47  
NON-HDL (mg/dL): 164 / 270 / 218

Not sure how to interpret all of this. That high triglycerides number seems bad... And the drop in HDL. 

Dr. GPT says that it's worth this temporary spike while I am losing significant amount of weight. Basically, if I did this for a year and was no longer obese, I could get it under control at that point. And there's also the mention that during periods of weight loss, numbers can spike. 

So my plan is stay the course, keep losing weight, try and exercise a bit more, stay on the statin, integrate more olive oil, fish and avocados. Then deal with this the right way at the end - more fiber, cut saturated fat, etc. 

Thoughts? Thanks!

1opbnc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetabolicMo/comments/1opbnc8/if_youre_doing_everything_right_but_still/,"If you're doing everything ""right"" but still exhausted, it might be your sleep (not your diet)","A lot of people think they just need to eat cleaner or take more supplements to fix energy and hormone issues. Turns out, the stress and sleep piece of the puzzle often gets completely overlooked.

Here's the connection: when you're chronically stressed or your sleep is inconsistent, your body keeps pumping out cortisol. That cortisol tells your liver to release glucose for ""emergency energy,"" which means insulin stays elevated all day long. Over time, cells stop responding to insulin properly (hello, insulin resistance).

This creates a cascade: stubborn weight, hormonal chaos, fertility struggles, constant cravings, and that bone-tired feeling no matter how many hours of sleep you get.

**Some things that can actually help:**

* Getting outside within 1-2 hours of waking (even on cloudy days) to reset your circadian rhythm
* Cutting off coffee by 1-2 PM (this one's tough but makes a huge difference)
* Finishing workouts and meals 2-3 hours before bed
* Creating a real wind-down routine (no screens 60-90 minutes before bed, dim lights, herbal tea instead of wine)
* Eating sleep-supportive snacks when hungry at night (Greek yogurt with tart cherries, banana with pumpkin seeds, walnuts)

**The biggest insight: your hormones don't need more hustle, they need more rhythm.**

You can't out-supplement or out-diet chronic stress. But you *can* retrain your nervous system to feel safe again, and that's when insulin sensitivity, energy, and hormones start to balance out.

Has anyone else noticed a connection between their sleep quality and their hormone symptoms? What's worked (or hasn't worked) for you?

I moved to Philadelphia a while ago, and got to work trying every coffee roaster in town. I wanted to share my thoughts and to hear what you all thought.

Five disclaimers:
- **Rankings are subjective. Your list can differ from mine, and that’s okay!**
- These rankings assess coffee quality only, not vibe or value or speed or non-coffee offerings. To qualify, a shop must roast their own beans — though I made an exception for shops uniquely serving a sufficiently local roaster’s beans, as well as for nationwide chains like Starbucks and La Columbe as reference points. This methodology excludes shops like Function Coffee Labs or Alchemy Coffee Lab, which simply use Vibrant and Elixir beans, respectively.
- I only tried Iced Americanos with a splash of whole milk or Iced Lattes from each spot, so these rankings don’t account for drip coffee, cold brew, or take-home options for specialty beans. Personally, I love pourovers — but many shops don’t offer them, it was the middle of summer, and relatively few shops do them well.  
- For shops with multiple locations, I picked the one closest to Center City. Experiences sometimes differ across locations. 
- I hate to give local businesses negative “press,” but I saw this as a necessary ingredient to celebrating those local businesses doing a great job. I’m routing for all local businesses, always!

This list answers where I think you should go for an on-the-go espresso drink, since rating beans comes with more variability and optionality. For beans at-home, consider Thank You Thank You (strong international options), Elixir (free drink), or Passenger. Some shops have great single origin beans, but use mediocre alternatives for their in-shop drinks.

I may have just gotten into second but it was hard to tell I don’t hear well on top of the popper and the wind. Ran 3 batches and tried to be consistent.

come early june, i decided to do further testing to see if i was a candidate for a TIF surgery, since that seemed lower stakes and effective for small hernias. manometry was normal. Bravo pH study showed a DeMeester score of 19.8, i.e., abnormal, but eating normally during the testing period was weirdly...not bothersome. so i just kind of kept cheating regularly. i went back to coffee, chocolate, even pizza. fast forward five months, after an accidental encounter with some Thai chilis, i seem to be roughly back where i was a year ago. meanwhile, in July, when i did an esophagram, it said the hernia was 4 cm but only visible in the swimmer's position. that aligned with the Bravo data, which seemed to show abnormal levels when i was in bed at night. 

the main thing that's kept me okay for months, i think, has been making sure to give my system as much time as possible to process stuff before i lie down. this time, though, that doesn't seem to have been enough. i went to bed >5 hours after eating and took a couple Tums after the dinner and 20 mg famotidine later too.

i have a leading doc ready to do a robotic Toupet or CTIF on me. here's the thing, though: my symptoms are still not \*that\* bad, so surgery seems like a big jump? the TIF seemed like not that big a deal, but the others kinda scare me. at the same time, i don't want to do PPIs forever, so i'm stuck, which i'm guessing is a familiar feeling for many of you. i'm scared about not being able to lift heavy things (like for example my kids; the older one is over 50 lbs. already and sometimes i like to pick him up, it's nice to be able to play around with him) or throw up for the rest of my life for fear of winding up way worse than i am now. is my anxiety overblown? 

i'm 42. should i push on for now, maybe trying PPIs again for a bit, and procrastinate? my endoscopies (they did a second one in june for the Bravo implant) both showed that my esophagus looked fine.

Deleted the posts since but they're still there under ""Deleted"" I guess. This is a throwaway account because I want to keep my privacy.

Sympoms came out of nowhere after lots of stress at work. First slowly, then to the point I couldn't do anything. Constant.

A lot of despair. A lot. ""Life is done"". Spending days in bed, weeks at a time at home. Terrible headaches and no balance. Couldn't even empty the dishwasher for months. Had to be helped walking to doctors appointments. Scans and blood tests clean. Very little hope.

Had all the meds. Norts and LOLs and SSRIs and SNRIs and the lot. Couldn't take any of them, would make me even dizzier. Stopped each one after a few days (I know you should take them longer but I couldn't handle it)

Symptoms 24/7. No time off. Dizzy 24/7 to the point that it's hard to even go from the couch to the restroom. And headaches 24/7 alongside it. For months and months. No better days. Darkest thoughts. Suffering with pain 24/7. Crying in bed. Wife crying non-stop seeing me. Thousands on therapy to keep myself from sinking even further.

**What I did to recover -**

Meditation, and kept walking places despite the pain and disbalance. I was literally ""falling forward"" walking for months. Dragged myself out of bed every day. Just kept walking and suffering like crazy. On and on. Overtime, sometimes, the disbalance would go from 90/100 (100 being bedbound) to 85 or 80. Then back to 90 and stuck at home again. Up and down. Then after 7 months or so, I started getting slightly better days of 70% disbalance and pain. Started going to the gym a bit. It was always up and down, like the stock market. Didn't know how I'd wake up.

After almost a year since this started, I can say that I'm at about... 85-90% of my usual self. Just came back from a week in Manhattan walking 25,000 steps+ every single day, including shopping malls. Up until a few months ago I would cry-laugh imagining something like that. My dream as I wrote it in my notes and self-recorded video notes was being able to empty the dishwasher without immense suffering, or to walk 5 minutes to the grocery store not feeling like I'm ""falling"" towards it and everything feeling ""off balance"".

Well... I did it. Most of the time in NYC I felt almost normal.

I remember looking for posts like this here at my worst, and I felt obligated to come back and give people some hope.

Do I still have ups and downs? Yeah. But the downs are not house-bound. I maybe go from being 85% ""back to normal"" to 70%. It's just a ""not great"" day, but I still do everything I need to do, work full time. Go shopping, even on those days.

I've been going to the gym lifting heavy regularly for the past 3 months now, and even did some 3k runs.

So yeah.. Just wanted to give some hope.

**What did I do again -** meditation daily (this one felt totally useless but I kept doing it). About 20 minutes twice a day. Sometimes more when I was bed-bound. And walking outside even at my absolute worst, and trust me - it was the worst for like 7 months straight. Assisted walking, needing help making a cup of coffee, couldn't walk the dog. And again - 24/7, I didn't have it in waves. I was suffering from the moment I opened my eyes, and even during sleep sometimes. Anyway, nothing else. I couldn't keep any pills down. I just progressed myself slowly and with great difficulty, baby steps. For reference I'm in my late 30's.

I just kept pushing and pushing and pushing even when I had to fight through tears.

**What I didn't do -** No pills, no special diets, no vestibular exercises.  
I'm not anti those things, I just couldn't do them.

  
**Future -**

Will I go from 85% back to 100%? Maybe. My feeling tells me I can probably go to 95%. I don't know about ""back to 100% normal"", but who knows?

I'm currently training for a Spartan Race (which I did a couple times before). I'm gonna attempt it in about 6-8 months from now

Good luck out there, If I could, you also can.

I stared my fragrance journey fairly recently. Before buying some decent stuff, I just used nautica voyage mostly and nothing else. 

Here’s all the decants I tried and some full retail packs I got and short reviews of all: 

1. Davidoff Coolwater Intense: My first EDP. It’s strong, long lasting and has a fresh shower gel smell. The longevity is amazing. 

2. Tascano Leather: I love the smell of leather and this one’s an instant favourite. I blind bought it and fully paid off. Cheap and amazing luxurious leather profile. Doesn’t last as long but as it’s cheap, you can reapply as needed. 

3. Lattaffa Asad: A familiar spicy and peppery fragrance. Very addictive and something you can’t go wrong it. 

4. Liquid Brun: Strong vanilla and citrus with insane longevity. I’ve never seen a sweet perfume last this long. And for the price, it’s an absolute bargain. I’ll definitely get the full bottle of this soon. 

5. Tobacco Touch: Very close to liquid brun, but without the spicy or citrusy notes. I prefer liquid brun over this for the complexity and longevity. 

6. Theoreme Rur Broca: By far the most noticeable fragrance. This scent is instantly noticeable to family members and colleagues. Got compliments from everyone and they wanted to know what the perfume is. I was shocked after checking the price of a full bottle. This is possibly the cheapest one but it’s noticed by everyone and it lasts the entire day with just 5-6 sprays. Although the smell is kinda synthetic, it’s definitely worth using this on hot and humid. 

7. Y EDP: I don’t get the hype, but this is unfortunately not for me. I also have the Vulcan few and it smells 90% the same. Fruity, mango, citrus is all I get. 

8. Porto Neroli: Smells exactly like Davidoff coolwater woman (which I also have), but it’s a bit long lasting and smells a bit synthetic. Not my favourite but can be used occasionally. 

9. Versache Eors flame: Very unique citrus and spicy notes in the opening. Something I’ve never smelt before. Very fresh and energetic. Definitely might pick this up later. 

10. Khamrah Qhawa: Most unique scent profile in the list. Ginger, coffee, sweet fruit. Very strong and sweet as fk. Very well suited for night times. I love this. 

11. Jasoor: Fresh, citrusy, fruity. Perfect for any season. Very underrated.

In the fast-changing world of **short-term rentals**, getting views but not bookings is one of the most frustrating challenges for hosts. Your photos look great, your property is clean, your rates seem fair — yet the reservations just don’t come. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Many hosts face this silent problem that hides behind attractive metrics. The truth is, travelers today are no longer booking based on looks alone; they’re booking based on **trust, clarity, and emotional connection**. It’s not just about what they see — it’s about what they feel. And that’s where hosts need to evolve, especially those offering[ **Luxury Vacation Rentals**](https://www.llivo.com/p/luxury-vacation-rentals) or high-value stays that promise more than just a bed.



https://preview.redd.it/3rqtpwtpfhzf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad37e1a82c73288cab2adab750aeba9ed68411cd

# The Invisible Wall Between “View” and “Book”

When travelers browse listings, their first impression forms in under ten seconds. But what really decides whether they click “Book” is confidence. Generic descriptions, unclear pricing, or inconsistent photos quietly break that confidence. Hosts often underestimate how small details — like a missing amenity photo or unclear cancellation policy — trigger second thoughts. Even when a listing looks visually appealing, hesitation grows if the guest doesn’t sense **transparency** or **human warmth** in the way it’s written. Today’s traveler reads between the lines; they want reassurance that what they’re seeing is real.



# Authentic Storytelling Converts Views Into Bookings

A modern listing isn’t just a digital brochure — it’s a story. Guests don’t just want to see your property; they want to imagine themselves living there. Listings that focus only on technical details (“2 bedrooms, Wi-Fi, pool”) miss the emotional layer that drives conversions. You don’t need marketing tricks — you need **authentic storytelling**. Describe experiences, not just spaces. Replace “Fully equipped kitchen” with “Wake up to the smell of fresh coffee while sunlight fills your open kitchen space.” That’s what turns browsers into bookers. At Llivo, every host is encouraged to show individuality — not copy others — which is why the[ **Llivo Benefits**](https://www.llivo.com/p/llivo-benefits) model is designed around giving hosts creative freedom without penalties or hidden fees.



# Hidden Fees and Mistrust Kill Bookings Instantly

The fastest way to lose a booking is to surprise a traveler at checkout. Hidden fees, cleaning charges, or extra costs that appear too late in the process often lead guests to abandon their cart entirely. In an era where transparency is everything, hosts must be clear from the start. Even if your total price is higher than competitors, **clarity beats confusion**. Guests are more likely to book when they trust that your price is honest. Llivo solves this by offering flat host commissions and transparent guest fees — meaning guests know what they’re paying, and hosts know what they’re earning. This trust-first model builds reliability that many mainstream platforms have lost.



# Your Listing Might Look Great — But Does It Feel Real?

Travelers today can sense authenticity almost instantly. Overly staged photos, AI-generated descriptions, or identical-looking designs make listings feel cold. If your space doesn’t reflect your **personal hosting style**, it won’t connect emotionally. People book people — not algorithms. Adding a few genuine touches, such as local recommendations, small welcome gestures, or even a personal introduction in your listing bio, can dramatically improve conversion rates. That human element communicates warmth — something travelers remember long after checkout. To strengthen this kind of human-first hosting and income flow, explore[ **maximize rental income**](https://www.llivo.com/p/maximize-rental-income) strategies that help transform guest experiences into repeat stays.



# Small Adjustments That Can Change Everything

Sometimes, the gap between view and booking isn’t massive — it’s a few small details away. Ensure your photos look consistent in lighting and angle, write descriptions in your authentic voice, and remove unnecessary filler lines like “Perfect for everyone.” Travelers can tell when a listing tries too hard to sell. Instead, focus on honesty. Add social proof by mentioning how previous guests felt or highlight one signature element that makes your property different. Above all, keep updating your listing — because an active host signals reliability to search algorithms and to travelers.



# Final Words

In 2025, guests are not looking for just “places to stay.” They’re searching for connection, trust, and meaning behind every booking. When they view your listing and don’t book, it’s rarely about your price — it’s about your presentation, your tone, and your authenticity. The hosts who understand this shift and act on it are the ones who rise above the rest. Llivo empowers such hosts — not by algorithms, but by values built on transparency, individuality, and trust.

Start making your views count — and turn your browsers into bookers today.  
[ **Sign up on Llivo**](https://www.llivo.com/signup) and host in a way that reflects who you truly are.



# FAQs

**Q1: Why am I getting views but no bookings?**  
 Because guests might love your visuals but lack emotional or trust-based reassurance to complete their booking.

**Q2: How can I make my listing more trustworthy?**  
 Be transparent with pricing, avoid generic templates, and communicate with a human touch. Guests respond to honesty.

**Q3: Does storytelling really affect bookings?**  
 Absolutely. Guests book based on emotion. When they feel a connection through your words and visuals, conversion rates increase.

* **Pop culture moments** (movies, TV, memes) to illustrate ideas
* **Creative visuals, short essays, and stories** to make big concepts easy to understand
* **Bite-sized, shareable content**—think quick reads that still make you think

Our most expensive thing in the menu is 10.50 and that’s a 5oz burger with fries. So I know price isn’t a huge issue, most things are 6$ and up for customers. But the lack of golfers coming in is killing our budget, I do have a catering for the Super Bowl of 60-80 people but that’s not great for keeping the revenue they want. They want at-least 20k a month when the course is only open 630am-5pm.

How do I get customers in the door? Any online platforms I can join that isn’t DoorDash or grub-hub? (The corp said no because of the stigma about the drivers). ",3,1762367561.0,Chefit,6,1.0,False

I have an offer at (corporate divison, not Capital Markets) RBC for a data analyst. It is a 8 month role so i want to be sure about this. Pay is pretty good but i'm not sure if this is a good use of my time (compared to staying in school, shooting my shots at other more relevant positions for summer, etc).

For context, I am currently a second-year student in math spec & CS major. I only started coding in university so I am \*very\* behind my peers in terms of my portfolio & tech stack (academically doing well but that's another thing) - therefore i am desperate for any tech-related opportunities. I've done an internship in risk at a major insurance company before as well, but other than this, i don't really have a portfolio. Wondering if this job will be a good stepping stone for me to break into tech for my next next internship.

Throughout my internship, i will be taking 1-2 courses on the side as well as working unpaid for a startup as a SWE.

Is the DA -> SWE route common? How will a DA position prepare me for, let's say, a dev position? How can i leverage this opportunity to make the most out of it? (other than the networking/coffee chats aspect)

Thanks in advance! :)",2,1762367534.0,csMajors,4,1.0,False

A local coffee shop (which I will not name) posted a TikTok video to promote its establishment, and I'm not going to lie, the place looked stunning with its indoor garden aesthetic.

One of the top comments says (not verbatim): ""A beautiful spot like this deserves a more creative name and branding."" Which, okay, backhanded compliment.

The cafe owner, using his personal account, responds: ""It's been doing well the past three years. Let me know once you've built a business with your unique and creative branding. Thanks for the advice, Mr. Entrepreneur of the Year.""

People who saw the comment were understandably irked and called out his unprofessionalism.

It's *not* the worst type of response, but it has made me ponder something about customer communication: Would you, as a business owner, ever resort to passive-aggression and sarcasm in response to a harmless (albeit unsolicited) comment from a potential customer? And is that something you'd ever do on a public platform, where other customers can see? Do you stoop to their level? And isn't it PR 101 to never do so?

Hello kava gangstas,

I'm the guy who used to lurk here at 2 a.m. googling “does kava actually work or am I about to poison my liver?” Fast-forward three months and I’ve got a cupboard that would be the envy of a Pacific Island pharmacy and a Google spreadsheet that would make accountants cry.

Here’s the **TL;DR** of everything I learned on kava, ranked by “holy crap this is worth my rent money” to “maybe if it’s on sale.”

# Rules I Follow When Ranking Kava

* **Noble kava ONLY** (no two-day tudei hangovers)
* **Lab-tested** or **GTFO**
* **Price per gram** \+ **how fast it ships** \+ “**did I actually relax or just gag**?”

# The “I’d fight my mom for this” Tier

[MN Nice Ethnobotanicals](https://www.amentara.com/product/kava-root-kavalactone-extract-usa/?ref=kpugcmtp) **- $14 for 30% extract**  
Dropped one scoop in coconut water and 20 min later I was humming Bob Marley to my houseplants. Every batch has a QR code and lab sheet. Zero heavy metals, full kavalactone breakdown. If you’re anxious and hate measuring powder, start here.

[Art of Kava](http://artofkava.com) **- $35 for 8 oz Solomon waka**  
Smells like fresh dirt and vacation. Their blog taught me more in 10 min than three YouTube rabbit holes.

[Fiji Vanua Kava](https://fijivanuakava.com/shop/) **- $79 a pound**

# Real Talk: Anxiety & Liver Fears

[The 2002 scare](https://www.annieappleseedproject.org/blog-post/the-kava-kava-scare) was sketchy for extracts. Stick to noble, water-based, <250 mg kavalactones a day and you’re statistically safer than Tylenol.

1opavhd,https://i.redd.it/z9x5mxmmehzf1.jpeg,“Notable November” Capsule,"Aaah, I usually try to have my capsules done in the first couple days of the month but we’re already a sixth of the way through November!! Since this was rushed, I chose “Notable November” featuring some of my dearly beloved November scents. I have lots of decants and samples coming from Arae this month, so I figured I could focus on scents I already know and love, as well as a couple new obsessions.

Deconstructing Eden - **Orpheus’s Lament** - *Notes: Smoked resin, black tea, hinoki wood, benzoin, orris root, immortelle, tears of labdanum.*

BPAL - **Vex** - *A bone goddess’ sacred incense: fire and ash, bone shards, and stone.*

I blind bought this bottle as soon as it released and I have no regrets! The whole Skull Maskerade collection is really beautiful

BPAL - **Arae decants of Dahlia, Ravenna, and Kit Sahari** - I got decants of all the Skull Maskerades from Arae and these are all hits! There’s a scent for everyone in this collection, but they are all beautifully blended. Kit Sahari and Ravenna will definitely be full sizes down the road. Kit is a gorgeous hot sandy scent, and Ravenna is a luxurious tobacco and champaca.

Lalique - **Encre Noire** - *Dark woody vetivet and cypress*

It’s Encre Noire season!!! I adore this scent, it’s dark and moody and woodsy. The best dark and moody mainstream perfume out there (and cheap!).

NA - **Arae decants of Red Sandalwood Amber Incense and Eternal Netherworld Shabah** 

More classic scents for me. The Amber Incense and Shabah collections are always hits for me. These are two I didn’t full size because I have so many, but I do adore these decants. I try every scent from these collections when NA releases them! 

BPAL - **Vzdor** - *Opoponax, ebony, and black galbanum cast black shadows across mineralic amber and glittering sand.*

This is so good. The Ars Annis have been amazing hits with me lately, but the mineralic amber note here is really the star. Dark, sparkling, and resinous, this scent really brings an energy of eerie castles and fantasy worlds.

Diptyque- **Oud Palao** - *Oud, Rose, Vanilla, Incense*

Rose and I have recently been on rocky terms lately, but I think this scent is one I still love. The oud and incense really balance out the rose scent compared to the other Diptyque rose scents. This is pretty cozy for an oud.

Astrid - **Arae decant of Ghost Mare** - *Milk, powdery vanilla, soft musk, amber, copal, white tea, fougere, iris, delicate florals, and pale cedar.*

This wasn’t actually a huge hit with me initially since I wanted screechy copal and creamy milk, but this is beautifully well blended and pretty. I want to keep trying this sample and decide whether a full size is in order. 

NA - **Ozymandias** - *Resin of Royal Sweet Frankincense, Languid Amber filtered through Royal Amber Resin and harsh-less white pepper essential oil*

My beloved. Beautiful resin and amber. Saphir adjacent in some ways and sticks around for a long time. 

NCD - **Befriending the Dragon** - *Glowing embers of copal, sandalwood, and dragon’s blood resin, coriander, toasted oats, roasted hazelnuts, ginger root, copaiba balsam, bronzed suede, and a glimmer of ripe blood orange.*

I love having Nui Cobalt in every capsule since I mix their oils with Cerave lotion for hand cream in small batches. Usually I mix in the samples, but their new collection comes out this month, so I figured I can enjoy a FS for now. The copal, dragon’s blood, and sweet oats are a really lovely unique scent!

Arcana - **Witches Fly Through The Forest with Sasquatch-**  *The scent of a forested joyride on besoms. A knapsack stuffed with graham crackers, gooey marshmallows, and dark chocolate for making s’mores over the fire. Tree tops, black pinewood, delicate juniper branches, black spruce, Atlas cedarwood. A sliver of orange peel and a bit of fur.*

This is cozy woods and marshmallows. Simple, straightforward, and really gorgeous for the season. 

BPAL - **Kobold Barista** - *freshly brewed coffee with ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, and cream*

I have a love-hate relationship with coffee scents. I adore coffee itself but I have found coffee accords (especially EDPs) can go sour on my skin. Kobold Barista has been my coffee holy grail! So lovely, cozy, creamy, and works with my skin chemistry!

BPAL - **Witch Milk** - *Honey-infused goat milk, incense smoke, yew boughs, black pepper, mandrake root, ambrette seed, red currant, kitchen herbs, and fly agaric accord.*

BPAL goat’s milk accords were my original gateway into the world of indies (Vampire Milk!!). Witch Milk is so lovely and balanced, a beautiful cup of warmed milk in the witch’s hut as she brews up a potion. 

BPAL - **Arae decant of Hiss and Hearse Atmo Spray** - I got an Arae decant of this and I’m loving it! I might end up snagging a perfume oil of this BPAL scent since it’s part of the Weenies. I definitely don’t use Atmos enough but there are some really hidden gems in the catalog!

I realize I haven’t included hair glosses in my capsules and maybe should start… I wonder if it would make the posts a bit cumbersome though…

1opaupr,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1opaupr/my_experience_with_orthodoxy_so_far/,My experience with Orthodoxy so far,"Hi guys. So for the record I’m a 21 year old Latina woman and I go to church by myself. An Orthodox Church is literally across the street from my house so I walk there all the time. At first, I really loved it. I immediately made a friend there when I first got there. However over time, I realized that there are a lot of Trump supporters in orthodoxy and some have really right wing conservative beliefs. Some people in my parish have those beliefs and to be honest, I’m very progressive and a democrat and I’d rather not associate myself with people who have those beliefs. Also most people at my parish are all either white or Greek Americans. There’s only a few Latinos at my church so it does feel somewhat isolating. Also, I was the only woman there for almost a whole year so I the only people I really talk too there and sit with at coffee hour are other young men between ages 17-25 and it’s a mix of chicanos and white boys. Not to mention, I developed a crush on a guy from there but it’s clear he’s not interested in me so seeing him every Sunday at church was not helping me at all because I got really infuated with him and I even had dreams about him. I just want to point out that, I never lost my faith in God, I still pray every day, it’s just the culture I don’t like. I’m not as hardcore as some other orthodox Christians are though. I’m more private with my orthodox faith but I do pray, I do read theology, I do have prayer books and an orthodox bible and an icon corner however I prefer to pray the rosary. My patron saint is Saint Xenia. I got my godmother(who is actually Latina like me). I used to go to church every Sunday but I missed church for two weeks because I was struggling with depression and anxiety because my uncle had a heart attack, my mom’s work permit and green card were denied not to mention I’m unemployed and broke because I can’t seem to find a job anywhere and also seeing my crush every Sunday at church was causing me a great deal of anxiety so I decided I needed a break from church so I missed two weeks and a girl from church who started coming to church a month ago reached out to me and told me that she’s there if I need to talk to someone and that she was worried because I hadn’t gone to church so honestly, she really made me feel better. She’s the only that truly reached out so I think I’m going to go back this Sunday but one thing, I learned from all this is to really only go to church for the service and to praise God. Don’t make deep connection and friendships with the people there. Keep and maintain your social circle outside of church because most people at church won’t have the same values you have. I only have probably 2-3 people from there that I actually consider actual friends. So that has been my experience at church so far. What do you recommend? And care to comment if you had a similar experience as mine ",7,1762367192.0,exorthodox,16,0.89,False

Hello kava gangstas,

I'm the guy who used to lurk here at 2 a.m. googling “does kava actually work or am I about to poison my liver?” Fast-forward three months and I’ve got a cupboard that would be the envy of a Pacific Island pharmacy and a Google spreadsheet that would make accountants cry.

Here’s the **TL;DR** of everything I learned on kava, ranked by “holy crap this is worth my rent money” to “maybe if it’s on sale.”

# Rules I Follow When Ranking Kava

* **Noble kava ONLY** (no two-day tudei hangovers)
* **Lab-tested** or **GTFO**
* **Price per gram** \+ **how fast it ships** \+ “**did I actually relax or just gag**?”

# The “I’d fight my mom for this” Tier

[MN Nice Ethnobotanicals](https://www.amentara.com/product/kava-root-kavalactone-extract-usa/?ref=kpugcmtp) **- $14 for 30% extract**

1opaqd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_zezulin/comments/1opaqd1/a_24yearold_turned_down_a_chanel_bag_for/,"""A 24-year-old turned down a Chanel bag for Coachella tickets. Here's why this matters for every brand. [Long post, data included]""","**TL;DR:**

* Gen Z's luxury satisfaction is 25-30 points lower than millennials (Bain)
* US resale market growing 5x faster than retail, heading to $74B by 2029
* Housing is unaffordable on both continents = spending priorities shift to experiences
* Status logic is changing: ""what you become"" > ""what you own""
* Brands optimizing for ownership are losing to experience-first brands

Last spring, David, a lawyer from Munich, called his friend Paul over coffee. He was genuinely confused. His 24-year-old daughter had just turned down a graduation gift—a classic Chanel flap bag he'd been saving for—and asked for festival tickets instead. Coachella. Primavera. ""Maybe Glastonbury if you're feeling generous, Dad.""

David couldn't wrap his head around it. ""That bag holds its value. It's an investment. The festival? Gone in a weekend.""

Paul nodded. He'd heard the same story from his colleague in Chicago, whose son chose a three-week trip to Thailand over a new BMW lease. And from his sister in Amsterdam, whose daughter was saving for a permaculture course in Portugal instead of furniture for her apartment.

Something fundamental was shifting. And it wasn't just ""kids these days.""

# The Numbers Don't Lie (Even When We Wish They Would)

Here's something that should make every luxury brand executive on both sides of the Atlantic sweat a little: **Gen Z's satisfaction with luxury experiences scores 25 to 30 points lower than millennials at the same age** (Bain & Company). That's not a dip. That's a cliff.

2024 was one of the weakest years for personal luxury sales in recent memory, down 2% year over year globally. Meanwhile, the secondhand luxury market? Booming. In the U.S., **resale grew 14% in 2024—five times faster than regular retail**—and it's heading toward **$74 billion by 2029** (ThredUp). In Europe, platforms like Vinted and Vestiaire Collective are packed with Gen Z buyers hunting pre-owned Gucci, vintage Hermès, and designer pieces at 60% off retail.

They're not broke. They're deliberate.

When David's daughter finally explained her choice, she didn't say ""I can't afford the bag."" She said, ""I'd rather have the memory. I'd rather tell stories about dancing in the desert with my friends than carry something everyone else is carrying.""

Status hasn't disappeared. It's just speaking a different language now.

# The Three Forces Reshaping Everything

If you want to understand why your customer isn't buying the way they used to—whether they're in Berlin or Boston, Prague or Portland—you need to understand the three tectonic plates grinding beneath their feet.

**First: Housing became a fantasy on both continents.**

In Prague, a 70-square-meter flat costs about **14.2 times the average annual salary** (Deloitte Property Index). In Munich, it's not much better. Across the EU, more young adults aged 25–34 are living with their parents than at any point in recent history (Eurostat).

The U.S. isn't any kinder. The **median first-time homebuyer is now pushing 40**—a record (NAR). Redfin reports mortgage payments hit all-time highs in 2025. Zillow estimates you need **80% more income to ""comfortably afford"" a typical home than you did in 2020**.

From Dublin to Denver, the math is brutal.

When the cornerstone of adult life—owning your own space—moves from ""delayed gratification"" to ""maybe never,"" everything else shifts. Why save for a down payment that won't come? Why not book the trip to Bali, take the sommelier course, and invest in the experience that actually happens?

**Second: Inflation rewired the brain (differently, but equally).**

Europe's inflation shock was traumatic. Even as headline numbers cooled, real incomes stayed squeezed. People started making micro-optimizations that became permanent habits. Private label groceries surged. Discounters like Lidl and Aldi gained a massive share. In the UK, **75% of people now buy flowers at supermarkets** rather than from florists.

The U.S. followed a similar path, just with different players. **Private label sales hit a record $271 billion in 2024** (PLMA). Food-at-home inflation cooled but stayed elevated (+2.7% year-over-year, BLS). Gen Z Americans now spend a larger share of their income on necessities than millennials did at the same age (Washington Post analysis of BLS data).

The pattern is identical on both sides of the ocean: Young consumers aren't cutting back randomly. They're making surgical decisions. Trade down on commodities. Trade up on what matters.

That supermarket flower trend? It's not about being cheap. It's about optimization. The *gesture* matters more than the *grandeur*. ""I thought of you"" doesn't require a €50 bouquet from a boutique or a $75 arrangement from 1-800-Flowers.

Frugality stopped being embarrassing and started being smart.

**Third: Climate anxiety is constant, and it's global.**

**62% of Gen Z and 59% of millennials across the U.S. and Europe felt worried about climate change in the last month** (Deloitte). Not in the abstract. Last month. That's not a political position—it's a psychological baseline humming beneath everything they do.

The EU Youth Survey 2024 ranks environment and climate among top concerns across multiple Member States. In the U.S., Deloitte finds many young workers have switched employers or pressured companies over climate action.

When you carry that weight, ""buy more stuff"" stops sounding like success and starts sounding like complicity. Circular fashion makes sense. Resale becomes aspirational. The refurbished iPhone isn't a compromise—it's a flex. ""I'm not feeding the machine.""

# The New Status Logic: Smart, Sustainable, Story-Driven

So what does status look like now?

In Paris, it looks like showing up to brunch in a secondhand Jacquemus dress, scored for €200, and casually mentioning you're leaving for a week in Puglia. In Brooklyn, it's the vintage Patagonia fleece, the natural wine knowledge, the long weekend in Oaxaca you found through an insider newsletter.

In both markets, it looks like turning down the company car upgrade to negotiate remote work so you can spend a month working from Lisbon or Mexico City. It looks like investing in a ceramics class, a marathon in Iceland, a perfect natural wine bar you discovered before anyone else did.

**The old formula was:** *Own the thing → Signal the wealth → Earn the respect.*

**The new formula is:** *Do the thing → Build the story → Become more interesting.*

Bain's data shows luxury brands are panicking because their old playbook—heritage, craftsmanship, exclusivity, logos—isn't landing the way it used to. But some brands are figuring it out.

Patagonia lets you buy used gear directly from them on both continents. Lululemon launched ""Like New"" programs. Rolex owners in London and Los Angeles brag about vintage models bought at auction, not the latest release. These aren't defensive moves—they're smart repositioning for a world where ""I was clever enough to find this"" beats ""I was rich enough to buy this.""

# What This Means If You're Building (Or Rebuilding) a Brand

I've spent the last two years documenting this shift, talking to young consumers across Europe and the U.S., digging through research from McKinsey to ThredUp to Eurostat, watching spending patterns, and asking one question over and over: *What do you actually want?*

The answer is never ""nothing."" It's ""something different.""

They want brands that design experiences, not just products with experiential marketing bolted on. They want transparent value—show me the cost breakdown, the materials, the lifespan, the resale value. They want to feel smart, not sold to. They want to *become* something, not just own something.

And here's the kicker: They'll pay for it. The ""affordable premium"" segment—quality goods at fair prices—is growing, while traditional luxury is stagnating in both markets. McKinsey documents this barbell effect across Europe: consumers trading down on basics to trade up on what matters. Circana sees the same pattern in U.S. retail data.

They're not cheap. They're *strategic*.

David's daughter didn't reject luxury. She rejected the old definition.

The festival tickets were in her Chanel bag. The photos, the late-night conversations under the stars, the sunburn, the inside jokes that'll last for years—that's what she'll carry for the next two decades. That's her heirloom.

# What's Next

This isn't a trend. It's not a generational quirk that'll pass when Gen Z ""grows up"" and starts acting like Boomers. This is a structural realignment of value itself, driven by economic reality on both continents, technological access, and a planet running out of time for waste.

Over the next few weeks, I'm going to unpack what I've learned—the supermarket flower phenomenon, the investment paradox, the dupe economy, and what I'm calling the *post-Instagram era* of meaning-driven consumption. I'm writing a book about it called *The Experience Is the Next Big Thing* and building something called the Experience OS to help brands redesign for this reality.

Because if you're still optimizing for ownership in an experience economy, you're not just behind. You're building for a world that doesn't exist anymore.

1opap51,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opap51,Mountain cabin loft apartment layout help.,"This is for a remodel of the loft apartment over my carriage house. I will be moving in there full time and will then rent out my main house as it is just me now. My house is in the mountains and is a popular tourist destination for Atlanta, so will hopefully be able to cover my monthly utilities and the renovation costs with rental income. The loft is about 900sf, one large room with a separated bathroom. I love the space but as you can see from the pics, the kitchen is awful and laid out in an odd fashion. I never understood why they put a peninsula that blocks access. I also don’t love that there was no good way to put in a bed that didn’t seem to be on display. So my plan is to build a wall/closet area to divide the kitchen off and create a pantry for the kitchen and a closet for the bedroom space. The bedroom is still open to the space but not immediately visible when you first walk in the door. As you can see from the pics, the roofline dips down into every corner, so no upper cabinets in most of the kitchen. But having that small pantry more than makes up for that. This plan also gives me the option of putting a dry bar in the living area where I can have a coffee station and a beverage fridge. 
So my dilemma is where to put the door into the closet. I can put it on the headboard wall but the will make it tight if I decide to upgrade to a king bed in the future. Putting the closet door on the wall facing the living area frees up room for a bigger bed later. I am also torn about where to put the dry bar, I can put it on the wall that faces the living area, or on the wall next to the pantry in the kitchen. To be honest, any option will be such a huge improvement I’m excited for any of them. 
Pics show original plan and the current kitchen followed by pics of the other options.

I'd like to get a good espresso semi automatic machine. I'd be totally new to this world.

I've settled on the Baratza Encore ESP as a grinder and I'm now looking at my options for a budget coffee machine.

Initially I wanted to get the De'Longhi ECP 33.21 (I'm from Europe). It's cheap (110 eur) and people say it's good.

I've seen the Sage Bambino much recommended. I can't get it for less than 330-350 eur from my country. Is it still worth it for triple the price of the ECP?

I could get the Bambino Plus for 470 eur, but honestly I'd rather save the money (I'm not that much into milk drinks).

Are there other options I should check out?

1opap3q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1opap3q,"24M, Northeast Ohio","Hi, all! I'm Eddie. I am a second-year Master of Divinity Student currently serving as a pastoral intern at a Brethren Church in northeast Ohio. I also work part-time for Grounds at the university my seminary belongs to. I hope to one day serve as a lead or assistant pastor and also as a professor of Bible, Theology, and/or Ministry at least at the undergraduate level. I am looking for a godly woman dedicated to Christ to see if we are compatible for marriage with children (no, you don't have to be a virgin and it's okay if you have kids). My preferred age range is 19-30 and distance range up to 250 miles.

My family started going to a United Methodist Church when I was ten, but I did not understand the gospel until I was 13 and was a believer then but still took several years to leave behind what was holding me back from fully living for the Lord, namely lust issues and holding onto a friendship with a girl who rejected me. By the age of 18, I was finally sold out to the Lord.

I now identify as Pentecostal (I hold to a soft version of Spirit-baptism and actively seek the gifts) and am very ecumenical; however I think that I would best jive with a woman who is also Protestant. Historically-rooted theology is important to me, and I lean conservative politically and socially. I also am a soft complementarian (i.e. the role of elder is reserved for a man, women can still lead in other capacities, the husband has a leadership role in the home, the wife still has authority in the home and can work outside of it, etc).

I am an extroverted introvert; I need my alone time but also am energized by one-on-one talks and other forms of quality time. Coffee, dinner, and hiking dates are my favorite. In my free time I enjoy journaling, reading novels and theology, lifting, running, cooking, going out with friends, creating devotional reels for Instagram, and playing my trumpet. You should also know that I am a fan of retro media; I love old movies like Star Wars and Ben Hur, I listen to a wide range of music from the 50's through the 90's such as The Beatles, The Who, Stevie Wonder, and Smashing Pumpkins, and am a fan of 80s and 90s television like Frasier, The Simpsons, and Cheers.

I just dropped a new episode of the Purple Political Breakdown that I think this community needs to hear, especially given how exhausted we all are with political division.

My guest Adam Mizel did something most of us only dream about - he actually quit screaming at the TV and decided to DO something about America's polarization. This former Wall Street guy co-founded US United after George Floyd's death and has been traveling the country in a purple pickup truck talking to everyone from deep MAGA to progressive activists.

**Key takeaways from our conversation:**

* **Unity ≠ Unanimity** \- We don't need to agree on everything. We need respect, listening, and finding common ground where it exists
* **The 70% Solution** \- About 70% of Americans are moderate and exhausted by extremes, but they've checked out. We need to re-engage them
* **Stories > Statistics** \- Adam changed a Montana MAGA supporter's mind about Arab Americans not through data, but by sharing his experience at a Dearborn Heights fundraiser where everyone sang the national anthem
* **Start Small** \- Wear purple, take a unity pledge, buy a stranger coffee, call that relative you stopped talking to over politics

**The most powerful moment:** When a former Marine said he could never unify with anyone who burns the flag, Adam asked him: ""Didn't you fight for their right to do that? Maybe ask WHY they feel that's their only option?"" The Marine's response: ""You're right. I need to ask the question.""

Adam's organization is doing practical things like:

* Unity Seats at sports events (imagine meeting a stranger at a Giants game instead of arguing online)
* National Unity Day (December 13th)
* Monthly ""30 For US"" conversations connecting random Americans
* Sheriff Unity Network bringing communities together

This isn't some Pollyanna ""let's all hold hands"" nonsense. It's about breaking out of our bubbles before democracy breaks down completely.

The conversation gets into the hard stuff too - abortion, racism, extreme ideologies - and how to have those conversations without losing our humanity.

If you're tired of doom-scrolling and want actionable ways to heal divisions (starting with your own family Thanksgiving dinner), give this a listen.

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Tell a Rolo from a Ribeiro*

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of Misery and Majesty**  
Let’s cut to the numbers, shall we? The odds paint a clear picture: **Cruzeiro is the favorite**, with implied probabilities hovering around **43-45%** (thanks to decimal conversions and a collective sigh from bookmakers). Grêmio? They’re the sportsbook’s version of a last-minute grocery store return—unloved but not entirely unwanted, with a **32%** implied chance to win. The draw? A tidy **30%**, which is about the same odds as your couch making it through the year without a single coffee stain.

The spread lines are equally telling. Cruzeiro is a **-0.25** favorite, meaning they’re expected to win or at least not lose by a goal. For Grêmio, it’s a **+0.25** lifeline—bookmakers are basically saying, “We’ll let you take a sip of hope, but don’t choke on it.” The total goals line? A **2.25-2.5** over/under, which is as exciting as a spreadsheet. Bet the under if you want to sleep well; bet the over if you enjoy dramatic last-minute own goals.

**Team News: Injuries, Suspensions, and the Tragic Tale of a Tied Shoelace**  
Grêmio enters this match nursing the emotional scars of a **2-0 loss to Corinthians**. Their offense? About as effective as a toaster in a bakery—present, but incapable of producing anything resembling a loaf. Key defender **Kannemann** returns after a rest, but let’s be honest: replacing Wagner Leonardo with Marlon is like swapping your Wi-Fi router for a decorative bowl. It might look nice, but don’t expect TikTok-level streaming.

I was an engineer for a big tech company, pulling in six figures with benefits that were second to none. On paper, it was perfect. In reality, I spent my days staring at a screen, trapped in endless meetings about synergy and deliverables, feeling like a tiny, well-paid cog in a machine I didn't care about. My soul was shriveling up, one spreadsheet at a time.

The only time I felt alive was in my garage, covered in sawdust, working with wood. So, after a particularly soul-crushing Tuesday, I did it. I drafted my resignation letter, ignored the baffled look on my boss's face, and walked away from the golden handcuffs. My goal? To start a one-man custom furniture business out of my garage. My friends were supportive but confused, and my parents basically held an intervention. I think my dad's exact words were, 'You're trading a career for a hobby!'

The first year was, to put it mildly, absolute hell. I burned through my savings faster than I could have imagined. I was working 80-hour weeks, my hands were constantly covered in cuts and splinters, and my income was a literal joke. I remember seeing my friends post pictures of their new homes and fancy vacations on Instagram while I was eating ramen for the fifth night in a row, stressing about whether I could afford a new blade for my table saw. There were at least a dozen moments where I sat on my dusty garage floor at 2 AM, thinking, 'Everyone was right. I'm an idiot.'

Then, slowly, things started to change. A local coffee shop took a chance on me and ordered a dozen custom tables. The feedback was amazing. A designer saw the tables, loved them, and commissioned a massive conference table for a corporate client. Word-of-mouth started to build, and the orders went from a trickle to a steady stream. The feeling of seeing my bank account finally climb back up was great, but the feeling of seeing something I built with my own hands being used and admired by strangers? Absolutely unbeatable.

Today, I'm actually making more than I did at my old engineering job, but honestly, that's just a bonus. I control my own schedule, I create tangible things that people love, and I feel a sense of pride in my work that money could never buy. It was the hardest, scariest, and most stressful thing I've ever done, but it was worth every single splinter and sleepless night.

So, what's the 'crazy' leap you took that everyone questioned but ended up being totally worth it?",1,1762366626.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
