1n24nav,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cisdem-focus/id6445878472?mt=12,5 Simple Tips to Improve Focus When You Have ADHD,"I've been struggling with ADHD for more than 5 YEARS now. Like, sitting there crying because I care so much about getting things done but my brain just... won't cooperate?

Anyway, after trying too many things to improve my focus and be productive, I have some tips that can actually help someone here with ADHD improve:

**1. Pick One Start Time Every Day**

Pick one time (like 9 AM) and stick to it every day. ADHD brains work better with routines. Stop wasting energy deciding when to start. Make it the same time always.

**How to do it:** 

* Put your phone on airplane mode 10 minutes before start time (Do Not Disturb still lets you see messages).
* Set three alarms: 15 minutes before (heads up), 5 minutes before (get ready), exact time (start now).
* Put a bright sticky note on your mirror or coffee maker with your start time.
* Use the same start time on weekends too so it becomes a habit.
* Write down when you actually start each day for one week to see what stops you.
* Make a simple 3-minute routine before starting like cleaning your desk or making tea.
* Have a backup plan for when you sleep in. Do less work but do not skip the whole day.

**2. Use the 2-Minute Rule**

If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it right now. Don't put it on your to-do list. This stops small tasks from piling up and making you feel overwhelmed.

**How to do it:**

* Keep a box near your desk for things that need quick action (bills, stuff to return)
* Use your phone's voice typing for quick email replies instead of typing
* Set up auto-pay for bills and save common email replies as templates
* Do 2-minute tasks while waiting for things (coffee brewing, between meetings, before eating)
* Group similar quick tasks together (all emails at once, all phone calls together)
* Use the ""touch it once"" rule: when you pick up mail or see a message, deal with it right away
* Keep cleaning stuff in different rooms so you can clean quickly without looking for supplies

**3. Block Apps That Distract You**

Use an app that blocks other apps and websites. Pick one with ""hardcore mode"" so you can't turn it off when you feel weak. Start with 25-minute blocks. ADHD brains need outside help since willpower doesn't work well.

**How to do it:**

* Try your phone's built-in Focus mode first before getting new apps
* Block websites too, not just apps‚Äînews sites, shopping sites, social media
* Make different blocking setups for different types of work
* Play background noise while blocking to replace sound distractions
* Put your phone in another room first. It's free and often works better
* Give your phone to someone you trust when you need to focus deeply

**4. Make Big Tasks Really Small**

Instead of ""clean the house,"" say ""put away one thing."" ADHD brains get stuck on big tasks but can do tiny ones. Each small win makes the next one easier.

**How to do it:**

* Write each task as one simple action you can do without thinking
* Set a timer for 10-15 minutes, then stop completely (this stops you from getting tired and keeps it feeling good)
* Make simple step-by-step lists for big scary tasks like cleaning or paperwork
* Keep a list of small wins to look at when you feel bad about yourself
* Work near someone else for boring tasks. Having people around helps you finish
* Give yourself a treat after every 3-5 small tasks (snack, short walk, favorite song)
* Take pictures before and after small tasks so you can see your progress

**5. Get Ready for Tomorrow at Night**

Your ADHD brain is bad at making decisions in the morning. Your evening brain works better and can set up tomorrow to be easier.

**What to do each night:**

* Put out workout clothes even if you're not sure you'll exercise (one less morning decision)
* Make grab-and-go breakfast like overnight oats or put protein bars in your bag
* Set your coffee maker to start automatically when you wake up
* Put tomorrow's pills or vitamins in a small dish next to your water bottle
* Check the weather and put out clothes, shoes, and jacket by the door
* Pack lunch right after dinner and put it where you'll see it in the fridge
* Write tomorrow's most important task on a sticky note and put it on your laptop

**My daily routine**

**8:30 AM** \- Coffee, no phone  
**9:00 AM** \- App blocker turns on by itself  
**9:00-9:25 AM** \- Do hardest thing first (your brain works best now)  
**9:25-9:30 AM** \- Stand up, stretch, drink water  
**9:30-9:55 AM** \- Second work session

Three 25-minute sessions = good day. That's it.

**Try This Week**

**Monday**: Pick your start time  
**Tuesday**: Use 2-minute rule for small tasks  
**Wednesday**: Get blocking app, try one 25-minute session  
**Thursday**: Break one big task into tiny pieces  
**Friday**: Set up your space and clothes the night before

Pick ONE thing. Just try to make today a little better than yesterday. Getting better matters more than being perfect.",1,1756361788.0,ADHD_Programmers,0,1.0,False

1n24kf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1n24kf5/upstairs_nightmare/,Upstairs Nightmare,"Sorry for the long post but I need help. 

My husband(33m) and I(32f) moved into our apartment in Location: LA County about a year ago and very recently, a neighbor (M - late twenties to mid thirties) moved into the unit above us. 

For months, everything was normal‚Äîjust the usual sounds of apartment living. But things changed as soon as our upstairs neighbor moved in.

One Saturday morning, I was cleaning and listening to music. My husband was still asleep after working a night shift. The music wasn't excessively loud, but the bass was audible. Suddenly, I heard four loud, targeted bangs, one from each corner of our apartment. It sounded like a bowling ball had been dropped with force. The noise was so jarring that both my dogs and I were shaking, and it even woke my husband from a deep sleep. We felt threatened, as if the bangs were a message.

Later that day, we decided to try and speak with our neighbor directly. The leasing office was closed, so we went upstairs, hoping to introduce ourselves and resolve the issue amicably. He didn't answer the door. We decided not to push it, hoping that if we kept quiet, the problem would go away.

A few weeks later, the situation escalated. I had just woken up and was simply brushing my teeth in the bathroom. A massive bang came from above me, followed by the upstairs neighbor shouting, ""Shut the f*** up! Turn the f***ing bass off!"" I was shaken again, my dogs were terrified, and my husband was woken up once more. We went to the office, but it was another Saturday, so it was closed again. Feeling defeated, we decided to just keep to ourselves and try to be the best neighbors possible.

The true nightmare began another week later, on a Thursday morning. My husband got home from work around 2 a.m. He took our dogs out and came back inside to lie down. I was in a deep sleep when a deafening bang shook our apartment. My dogs were terrified, and my husband, who had just laid down, was furious. He went upstairs to politely ask if everything was okay.

When our neighbor opened the door, he had a knife. He flicked it open menacingly. My husband, shocked, put his hands up and said, ""Whoa, what is going on?"" The neighbor replied, ""You know what's going on."" My husband, genuinely confused, explained that he had just gotten home from work and that I had been asleep. The neighbor became more aggressive, complaining about a ""vibrating"" noise that he needed to stop. My husband reiterated that nothing was on, and the neighbor, without another word, slammed the door in his face, holding the knife in a threatening manner.

We went to the office on a weekday and we're finally able to talk to leasing management. They heard and understood our concern and recommended we call the police to report it.

We did call the police to report the incident, but the cops gave us options that seem to take too long for anything to actually happen to this guy. We're both busy with our new careers and we're newly Weds sooooo following up in a court system in LA County seems like a dragged out process. Especially because I feel unsafe now. 

Our leasing manger emailed us to follow up, mentioning that they have been in contact with their legal department and they are doing what they can to have him 'removed'. It's a bit vague. 

As I mentioned my husband works nights. 
I do have a medium sized dog and a small dog, which a great for alerting me, but I still don't feel safe. I work from home so am there most of the time, and not by choice. 
I try to go out to run errands or work from coffee shops because I'd rather not be home. 

It also seems as if the noise level from upstairs has gone up after our complaint.

I will take ANY advice... Or even stories to relate. 

Thanks!

Age: 36

Gender: F

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist end of next month, but meanwhile, I am trialing adhd meds and was left to wonder if it's possible ER makes me feel ill (has happened with other depots/er medications as well) because the medicine does not absorb as it would on a healthy individual? While my Crohn's is in remission, it has damaged my small intestine before and with the nature of this disease, it's not something that repairs itself.

I was started on Medikinet Cr 10mg, but reacting to it by falling asleep standing by 1pm. Literally, it's like lights out, surreal kind of sleepiness. Also increases bruxism, makes me overall irritable (I haven't had such emotional rollercoaster before starting these meds) and increases anxiety.   
  
So I was switched to Equasym retard 20mg  with Medikinet 5mg in the afternoon (to avoid needing to nap) and.. I feel not so great in the morning to afternoon, same bruxism, irritability, anxiety, sleepiness (though not to the point of falling asleep upright), but the IR version feels smooth in and smooth out. My evenings are great and smooth, mornings and afternoons not.

Is there something here that I should bring up to my psychiatrist during next visit or is it unlikely Crohn's affects how ER is absorbed? If small intestine absorption indeed does play a role, what considerations/options should or could be explored?

My habits around the medication are otherwise fine and I try to keep a consistent routine and schedule. I drink extra water, I time eating protein with the ADHD-meds. I don't smoke or drink. I do drink coffee, but it's never been something that perks me up.",1,1756361396.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm drumming on the steering wheel, getting psyched for my morning session. And I pull into the parking lot and look in my  rear view mirror and see this bald, wrinkled old man. And for a second, it‚Äôs a little shocking. I forgot i wasn‚Äôt still 18. I honestly don‚Äôt feel different than I did when I was that age. It‚Äôs a little odd. And I feel kind of stupid when my peers at the skatepark could all be my grandchildren. 

I guess my interest in extreme music, art, and literature wouldn‚Äôt be considered extreme if I was in my 20‚Äôs. I have not become more conservative as I‚Äôve aged. The exact opposite has happened. And I feel disconnected to men my age who play golf and complain about rap music or some other mundane bullshit. 

I‚Äôm not trying to cling to my youth, I just want to suck the marrow out of every bit of life I have left. And that means having fun with this aging meat sack. In every way possible. I just don‚Äôt really have other people in my life doing the same. Obesity really sidelines lots of people our age. I‚Äôm not going down that road.

1n24cmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n24cmw/upstairs_nightmare/,Upstairs Nightmare,"Sorry for the long post but I need help. 

My husband(33m) and I(32f) moved into our apartment about a year ago and very recently, a neighbor (M - late twenties to mid thirties) moved into the unit above us. 

For the first few weeks, everything was normal‚Äîjust the usual sounds of apartment living. But things changed as soon as our upstairs neighbor moved in.

One Saturday morning, I was cleaning and listening to music. My husband was still asleep after working a night shift. The music wasn't excessively loud, but the bass was audible. Suddenly, I heard four loud, targeted bangs, one from each corner of our apartment. It sounded like a bowling ball had been dropped with force. The noise was so jarring that both my dogs and I were shaking, and it even woke my husband from a deep sleep. We felt threatened, as if the bangs were a message.

Later that day, we decided to try and speak with our neighbor directly. The leasing office was closed, so we went upstairs, hoping to introduce ourselves and resolve the issue amicably. He didn't answer the door. We decided not to push it, hoping that if we kept quiet, the problem would go away.

A few weeks later, the situation escalated. I had just woken up and was simply brushing my teeth in the bathroom. A massive bang came from above me, followed by the upstairs neighbor shouting, ""Shut the f*** up! Turn the f***ing bass off!"" I was shaken again, my dogs were terrified, and my husband was woken up once more. We went to the office, but it was another Saturday, so it was closed again. Feeling defeated, we decided to just keep to ourselves and try to be the best neighbors possible.

The true nightmare began another week later, on a Thursday morning. My husband got home from work around 2 a.m. He took our dogs out and came back inside to lie down. I was in a deep sleep when a deafening bang shook our apartment. My dogs were terrified, and my husband, who had just laid down, was furious. He went upstairs to politely ask if everything was okay.

When our neighbor opened the door, he had a knife. He flicked it open menacingly. My husband, shocked, put his hands up and said, ""Whoa, what is going on?"" The neighbor replied, ""You know what's going on."" My husband, genuinely confused, explained that he had just gotten home from work and that I had been asleep. The neighbor became more aggressive, complaining about a ""vibrating"" noise that he needed to stop. My husband reiterated that nothing was on, and the neighbor, without another word, slammed the door in his face, holding the knife in a threatening manner.

We went to the office on a weekday and we're finally able to talk to leasing management. They heard and understood our concern and recommended we call the police to report it.

We did call the police to report the incident, but the cops gave us options that seem to take too long for anything to actually happen to this guy. We're both busy with our new careers and we're newly Weds sooooo following up in a court system in LA County seems like a dragged out process. Especially because I feel unsafe now. 

Our leasing manger emailed us to follow up, mentioning that they have been in contact with their legal department and they are doing what they can to have him 'removed'. It's a bit vague. 

As I mentioned my husband works nights. 
I do have a medium sized dog and a small dog, which a great for alerting me, but I still don't feel safe. I work from home so am there most of the time, and not by choice. 
I try to go out to run errands or work from coffee shops because I'd rather not be home. 

It also seems as if the noise level from upstairs has gone up after our complaint.

I will take ANY advice... Or even stories to relate. 

Thanks!

# The Fourth Closet Tree

At the very end of The Fourth Closet, we see this tree. It is a normal tree in a green-hilly graveyard.

As has been seen time and time again, this tree is once again in the presence of an ending. This is the last we see of the Novel Continuity, and of course, the tree is there. We don‚Äôt know exactly what happens after this, but we can presume it was a new fresh-start on life for John and whoever was standing under the tree. So, as expected, the tree is there whenever a story ends and themes of freedom are around.

It is supposed to be an obvious tie in to the ending of FFPS. In FFPS, we have Charlie grave underneath the tree in a green hilly landscape. The children have been set free, and their story is over. In TFC, we have Charlie‚Äôs grave next to the tree in a green landscape. John is given the opportunity and freedom to start over, and maybe so is the woman who was under the tree. Regardless, it is the end of the story in the Novel Continuity.

Yes, I know the Graphic Novel shows that it is Charlie under the tree, but the OG book doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just a woman who takes John‚Äôs hand (iirc). The ending of the Graphic Novels where we see secret-Adult Charlie is purely the artist‚Äôs interpretation. And I‚Äôm glad because that would be one confusing and odd way to end the story. I‚Äôd prefer to think that the woman was Mrs. Emily, but I guess we‚Äôll never know.

**""All roads lead to Rome"", this tree appears only at the very end of The Fourth Closet. Not just being the end of the story, but the end of the entire continuity as a whole. Although we don't know for a fact what happens after this, we can assume it is John's fresh-start on life, freedom to do whatever he wants.**

# Foxy.EXE Tree

In Fnaf World, there is a minigame called Foxy.EXE. In this minigame, the ""desktop screen"" at the beginning is where we find the tree again.

The beginning of Foxy.EXE is meant to look like a computer desktop, and is clearly an homage to the famous Windows Desktop Background. The difference though is that Foxy.EXE has a single tree centered in the middle of the screen. Clearly this is supposed to be in the same vain as the FFPS Tree, SB Tree, etc. Another tree on top of a green hill. However unlike the others, this was the first. Foxy.EXE is the first time Scott came up with this idea of a tree on a green hill.

**Not really much of note other than this being another case of a tree on top of a green hill. I'm kinda realizing that it's everywhere now.**

# Bear of Vengeance Tree

In UCN, there are Intermission Cutscenes showing different ""episodes of shows"". One of these shows is The Bear of Vengeance. One of the locations in TBOV that we see is a tree atop a green hill/cliff.

This tree looks just like the tree from the FFPS Ending, and is in a similar location. This time, probably due to TBOV being an anime, it is highly exaggerated. Instead of being a large-ish hill among many, it is a large, pointed, green cliff in the center of a mountain range.

This is where The Bear does most of his talking. Usually talking about how he's gonna get The Fox. but most notably about his defeats. We see the most of the tree when The Bear is saying how he has been embarrassed by The Fox.

**Once again just another case of this specific tree on top of a green hill. I feel like the important part is less about what each trees meaning is, and more of just how often this specific tree and setting shows up.**

# Toy Chica: The Highschool Years Tree

In UCN, there are Intermission Cutscenes showing different ""episodes of shows"". One of these shows is Toy Chica: The Highschool Years. One of the locations in TCHSY that we see is a tree in a green hilly field.

Same type of tree we see in TBOV, except this time in the opposite environment. Instead of it being exaggerated and high up, the hill-aspect is nearly entirely gone. It is just a vibrant, bumpy, green field with some small hills in the background. It's the same type of environment, but it's odd that TBOV and TCHSY are polar opposites. TBOV exaggerates, TCHSY underexaggerates.

In the context of TCHSY, the tree appears at the very end where Toy Chica is talking about how none of her attempts with boys worked out. Aka, William Afton after killing the MCI talking about how he's gonna do it again someday (DCI). Really the most important thing to note here is that it's at the end.

**So once again, this specific type of tree in a green and hilly environment, with someone sitting underneath it. And it's at the end of another story.**

# The Tree of Life (again)

In SB, at the end of Rockstar Row, there is a broken stone pillar with the Tree of Life engrained on it.

In Rockstar Row, at the end there is a little section of cardboard cutouts. It is supposed to be the ""spooky section"", in a similar vein to the setting of Curse of Dreadbear. There is cardboard cutouts of Phantom Freddy, Ennard, Bonnie, Plushtrap, Nightmare BB, a couple gravestones, a Water Tower, Pumpkins, PlushBabys, Shadow Bonnie, and a dead tree. At the base of the dead tree, next to Shadow Bonnie, there is a stone pillar-like thing. That stone pillar thing has a circle with The Tree of Life engrained into it. The pillar is made of cardboard just like all the others, but it is meant to look like stone, and is broken off in a way that stone would instead of cardboard.

Now, I'm not exactly sure what this pillar is supposed to be. My first thought was a grave, but we see other cardboard graves that look completely different and more traditional. Then I thought maybe a location marker of some kind, but that feels kinda arbitrary. Regardless, it is at the base of a dead tree, looks to be made of stone (not really but it is intended to look that way), is broken and laying on it's back, and is hidden behind other cutouts. It also appears to be rotting or old, as it is dirty.

The main important detail is The Tree of Life that is engrained on it. It's just such an odd detail to add, that once again gives this thing importance that you wouldn't think it should have. The fact that it is at the base of a dead tree, is broken, is maybe a grave, and has The Tree of Life on it is the important details. As for what it means. I'm not sure. Maybe just the death part of the circle of life. Regardless, more important tree/tree of life stuff.

**Another depiction of The Tree of Life. I am now realizing how often it comes up in Fnaf, and that leaves me to wonder how this flew under our radar? I have never seen anyone else talk about it despite how often and important it is. Anyways, a broken stone pillar engrained with The Tree of Life, sitting at the base of a dead tree.**

# The Moon.EXE Trees

In SOTM, when playing Moon.EXE, you can encounter two different trees with faces on them off the side of the path.

I thought these were worth mentioning, but I will say this now that they aren't that notable. Moon.EXE is a pile of metaphors and lore, so this was the first place I looked when finding more GodTree evidence. Surprisingly all that I was able to find was two seemingly unimportant trees with faces on them. Nonetheless, I will talk about them both.

The first tree is the Scary Tree. It is directly outside of the window to the house you start in. It doesn't have any leaves, has an angry face on it's trunk, and has a bird nest on it. In the bird nest is a Party Time Chica Vacuum Cup. Using a ranger army knife that you get later, you can cut off the tree's branch.

Second is The Oak Tree. In front of the Oak Tree is a gator trying to eat a baby owl. The Oak Tree is off to the side of the path and has a frowning face. When we find it, it is in pain and groaning due to a ranger army knife in it. When we pull the knife out, the tree smiles and is in relief. Just after we leave and go meet Old Lady Sun, when we come back the Oak Tree has a Fredbear's Singin' Show record nailed onto it, the tree is in pain again. **Also, correct me if I'm wrong but, are the trees all oak? Like now that I'm looking at it, most of the trees (that aren't Baobabs) look to be Oak Trees? Right?**

So that's the Scary Tree and The Oak Tree in Moon.EXE. I don't exactly know what they could mean, but I'm pretty sure that they have significance. I have a few ideas on what they could be:

1. We play as David in Moon.EXE, the trees represent Edwin and Fiona, his two parents. Edwin being the scary one who is blocking David from danger, but isn't actually doing anything to stop him. Meanwhile Fiona is always getting the consequences of or hurt because of other people's actions.
2. The trees represent M1 and M2. M2 is the scary one, always getting people hurt (broken branch), and is surrounded by death (no leaves). He was originally meant to be David (Baby Owl), but is a husk of what he was supposed to be (empty bird nest). The oak tree is M1, the one with good intentions that never work. She tries to do the right thing and be good, but no matter what, she and the people around her always end up hurt.
3. The trees represent William and Henry. William is the scary one, always getting people hurt (broken branch), and is surrounded by death (no leaves). Henry is the oak tree, always trying to do the right thing, but gets hurt and suffers the consequences of William's actions.

Or they are there to just reinforce the idea that trees are important/alive. I don't know.

**So, a Scary Tree and an Oak Tree, one with an angry face, and one with a frowning face. You can save the Oak Tree, but it still ends up getting hurt regardless. The Scary Tree is dead and intimidating. These two might represent characters like Edwin and Fiona, William and Henry, or M1 and M2, although it is unclear.**

# Another Princess Quest Tree?

Ok so a while ago I saw a photo of the tree in PQ that usually appears in the graveyard, in the spawn area. I forget exactly where I saw it, but it was definitely a Reddit post. Anyways, I saved it and wanted to find out if it was a glitch or not. I never got around to asking, but I stumbled upon it again while making this post.

**Now this leaves me with the question I always intended to ask, is this tree a glitch or not? Because it kinda looks like it, but then again it could be a rare easter egg. So please help me on this one.**

# Oliver The Oak Tree

In Coming Home, there is an oak tree in Susie's backyard that Susie and Samantha name Oliver The Oak Tree.

Oliver the Oak Tree is odd. Throughout Coming Home, Oliver's leaves are slowly falling off (because it's Fall). But the weird thing is that once all the leaves fall off Oliver, Susie is forced to leave. Susie wanders her home as a poltergeist for over a year, once she learns that she is dead, a countdown begins. This countdown is Oliver's leaves falling off, and it is counting down to when Susie has to leave. It's implied that Susie leaving means being taken to Freddy's to possess Chica, and letting go of her old life. This is some pretty in-your-face implication too, considering that Chica literally comes to her house to drag Susie to Freddy's.

Now the question is, why is Susie's countdown Oliver's leaves? Well, the way that the story paints it makes it sound like a part of Susie's soul is in Oliver.... Which is weird, but it actually makes a ton of sense when you think about it. Firstly, how is Susie a poltergeist/wandering spirit? Well she doesn't know she's dead, but how? I mean it's kinda hard to not realize that unless you die under certain conditions, that of which Susie wasn't. So how didn't she realize she was dead? Because her soul was broken, split between Chica and Oliver. In a less literal sense, it's Chica VS Oliver. Chica representing Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, Susie's ""new home"", Oliver representing Susie's Home.

Another interesting thing is that the story kinda implies that Chica is the half of Susie's soul that remembers her death, is possessing Chica, and is in Agony. Meanwhile the main character is the half of Susie's soul that is peaceful, oblivious, innocent, and attached to Oliver through the power of love/joy (Emotional Impression). And that the story ends with Susie's soul being made whole again in a flash of light. Susie ends up leaving her home to go to her new home, so instead of Susie continuing to possess Oliver or remain as a poltergeist, she is fully taken to Freddy's (where we see her possess Chica, leading to her appearance in Fnaf 2 and Fnaf 1).

Anyways, I mainly want to focus on Oliver. Once again, and he is an oak tree like all the others. Technically this is the second time we have seen Susie and an oak tree connected (first time being in the FFPS ending with the graves). Once again, a tree put in the spotlight, relating to the supernatural, being an oak tree, etc. Nothing all too notable other than his role in the story, and the fact that he has an actual name.

**To recap, in Coming Home Susie names a oak tree in her backyard ""Oliver the Oak Tree'. She Emotionally Imprinted on it, when she died, her soul was split between Chica and Oliver. The part of her in Chica realized she was dead and was angry, meanwhile the part in Oliver didn't know that she was dead (became a poltergeist) and was friendly. There is also the possibility that** **GodTree's name is Oliver, or Oliver The Storyteller.**

# DIAAARACAD

I thought this was worth mentioning, but be fair warned that this one is just fun speculation.

In FFPS, there is a grave underneath the tree. We can assume this is Charlie's, but under closer inspection, it actually says ""*DIAAARACAD*"". Is it possible that this is the name of GodTree? It certainly sounds like a more godly name then Oliver, so yeah maybe his name is Diaaaracad.

Something else of note, if you translate the first part of DIAAARACAD, ""*Dia*"", into Scots Gaelic, you get ""God"".

Regardless, the grave is 100% supposed to be Charlie's, and ""DIAAARACAD"" is just placeholder text that you're not supposed to see.

**This one is really more of a fun headcanon. I can imagine this god saying ""My true name is DIAAARACAD, but you can call me Oliver.""**

# Narrative Parallels

Another thing I thought would be worth bringing up is all the weird narrative parallels. And how they might indicate a higher force, a storyteller even, carving the story.

First, I'll show the Striped-Shirt Kids:

|Striped-Shirt Kids|David Murray|BV|Gregory|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Associated Animatronics:|The Mimic|Fredbear|Glamrock Freddy|
|Carry-around:|White Tiger Plush|Fredbear Plush|Glamrock Freddy's Head|
|Guardian Figure:|F10-N4|Glitchbear|Vanessa|
|Killed by:|The Mimic|Fredbear|Glamrock Freddy??|
|Possesses:|The White Tiger|Fredbear|???|
|Date of Death:|6th Birthday|7th Birthday|8th Birthday??|

Next, I'll show a ""theory"" called SteelMadness. It's less of a theory and more of just an observation, but anyways here:

|Fnaf World|Steel Wool Game|
|:-|:-|
|Into Madness|BB's Air Adventure|
|Halloween Land|FallFest 83'|
|Tangle|Tangle|
|The White Rabbit|Vanny|
|Old Man Consequences|The King \[OMC\]|
|The Fourth Glitch|The Red Underground Lake|
|Bubba|Bub|
|Foxy.EXE|Eclipse in BB's Air Adventure|
|Coffee|Stay Up Latte'|
|Bouncepot|Test Tube Terrier|
|Virtual Freddy|AR Roxy|

Finally, here are just some general narrative parallels that pop up all the time. In both old and new Fnaf:

* M2 Stuffing People - William Stuffing People - Animatronics Stuff People
* The Bite of 83' - The Bite of 87' - Civil No. 834710865
* The Bite of 83' (Fredbear bites striped-shirt kid's head) - PQ Ending (Striped-shirt kid bites Freddy's head)
* The Bite of 87' (animatronic bites off Jeremy Fitzgerald's forehead) - HW (Jeremy's face is cut off)
* Fiona FallFest Fire - MCM Fire - FallFest 83' Fire - Fnaf 3 Fire - FFPS Fire - SB Fire
* **The Constant Depiction of Trees on Green Hills**
* Edwin's Queen's Anne Mansion Burning Down - Vlad's Queen's Anne Mansion Burning Down
* The Yellow Rabbit Man (William killing people wearing a rabbit suit) - Vanny (Vanessa killing people wearing a rabbit suit
* Glitchtrap's Character as a Whole (repeating everything William did)
* The SCUPER - The Fazbear Scooper
* Missing Children's Incident - Dead Children's Incident - Missing Residents Incident

There is a lot more, but all that gives you a good picture of how prevalent this theme is in Fnaf. It feels too prevalent to not have an explanation, right? Sure you could chalk it up to meta-narrative-themes, that is completely valid and is what I did for the longest time. But I am just going to throw out this idea, what if all this happens because of a higher power? What if the reason these themes are so prevalent/repetitive is because someone is literally making the story to be that way in-universe? They would be God, right? A storyteller? Right??

**Fnaf is littered with narrative parallels, themes, ""history rhymes/repeats itself"" motifs, etc. Although much of this is probably just meta, there is a possibility that there is an in-universe explanation as well. That a storyteller god is carving the story to be this way. Similar to FateFiona or MemoryVictim, except not horrible (I'm joking I love you MemoryVictim, FateFiona sucks tho).**

# Conclusion

Btw, remember when I said there was an old post about Andrew being represented by a tree? And how I couldn't find it? Well, [I found it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fnaftheories/comments/1gjhd7y/scrolling_through_twitter_and_found_this_thoughts/)

So what is the takeaway here? Well it looks like there is a lot more evidence for GodTree, and this theory/topic has a lot more to talk about then I initially thought. **Also, I need help from someone out there with two things.**

* **Are all the ""trees on top green hills"" all oak trees? I feel like they are but I'm not sure.**
* **Is the tree spawning in PQ a glitch or rare easter egg? I don't know which it is, and don't know how to figure out which it is.**

Did Scott intend this? Maybe. I think Scott is fully capable of showing an important theme or plot point over a long period of time. Maybe it isn't a fully fleshed out concept, but just an idea he tries to implement when he can. Or maybe the idea wasn't fleshed out until more modern times, and he had been slowly setting it up for years prior. If it is canon, then I feel like it might be one of those things that Scott is hesitant to show, almost like The Box. Or I'm batshit crazy and wrong. I'm fine with either one because even if I'm wrong, I still love GodTree.

To conclude I want to say this. **I will be making a third and final GodTree post after this.**

What to expect in this 3rd Post:

1. A combination of the first two GodTree posts.
2. The evidence and points will be edited, refined, and looked over again.
3. If I find anything new/realize between now and the time I make the third post, that will be added.
4. It will be a super long post that has everything I could ever want to say about this topic in it.

(1) Go to culinary school; that‚Äôs happening in January. (2) Write a book. Since I‚Äôm making number one happen I‚Äôve decided to push through the hardships and make number two happen but I so desperately need an outsiders opinion. I have 12 chapters down and I need someone to read all 22,000 words and tell me what they think. I love my friends and family but I want honest opinions not a vague ‚Äúoh yeah that‚Äôs great‚Äù and ‚Äúdo what you want with it‚Äù I need real, true, deep advice and have no one to go to. Here‚Äôs the first chapter (it‚Äôs long and the formatting isn‚Äôt going to look right on here; I‚Äôm sorry!!!) 

The morning light always finds me first.
It spills through the floor-to-ceiling windows of my apartment like liquid gold, pooling on the hardwood floors that have witnessed more sunrises than any mortal soul should ever see. I stand at the window, coffee growing cold in my hands, the faint aroma of its burnt sweetness mingling with the sterile scent of the city. A distant, almost inaudible hiss from the radiator adds to the quiet, a constant reminder of the silence that envelops me. Below, forty-three floors down, people scurry along sidewalks with purpose I once envied, a need I've long since forgotten how to feel. Their urgency brushes against my isolation, deepening the hollow in my chest.
My name, this time, is Leo Solis. It‚Äôs a good name‚Äîsimple, forgettable, and human enough that no one asks questions. I‚Äôve carried so many names over the centuries that sometimes I forget which one I‚Äôm supposed to answer to. But Leo feels right for this decade, this city, this particular shade of aching loneliness that settles into my bones like an old winter‚Äôs chill‚Äîfamiliar, unwelcome, and impossible to banish.
The apartment is too large for one person, but I've grown accustomed to the echo of my footsteps in empty rooms. Minimalist furniture, expensive but cold, and a grand piano that sits in the corner with its black surface reflecting the morning sun. I bought it three years ago with the intention of filling the silence, but most days the quiet feels safer than the risk of neighbors hearing melodies that might sound too old, too knowing, too much like something that shouldn't exist in this century.
I set the coffee cup on the marble countertop and run my fingers through hair that catches the light like spun gold. In the bathroom mirror, my reflection looks exactly as it has for the past two thousand years‚Äîtwenty-eight, maybe thirty if you're generous, with eyes the color of summer sky and tan skin that seems to hold its own light. Immortality is a gift that feels more like a curse when you're brushing your teeth alone for the ten-thousandth morning in a row.
The routine is always the same. Shower. Coffee. Stand at the window. Pretend to read emails on a laptop that connects me to a world I can observe but never truly join. I have money‚Äîmore than I could spend in several lifetimes, accumulated through investments and the occasional divine intervention in the stock market. But I‚Äôve learned that wealth means nothing when you have no one to share it with.
Despite my complaints with how numb I've grown living a virtually unreachable mortal life, I've done it to myself. Rather than taking responsibility and letting the oracles' prophecy‚Äîthose ancient fates spoken by Delphi, my own sacred site‚Äîfollow through, I decided to try blending into mortal life as an escape. It seems to have worked for the time being, but I can‚Äôt seem to shake the weight of my sister Artemis‚Äôs words. Mortal flesh is but a fleeting veil, Apollo; its refuge cannot endure. Across the ages, none have unraveled the oracle‚Äôs decree, nor slipped its grasp, not even you, brother. I didn‚Äôt listen; I knew what she said was true, but I had to at least try. Just this morning, among the whispers of the city, I overheard a news report about increasing sunspot activity, a benign fact to most but one that makes my heart race with its implication‚Äîcould the sun itself be trying to speak to me, reminding me of who I truly am? This fleeting thought follows me like a specter, a reminder that my chosen disguise might soon unravel.
By nine AM, I'm dressed in clothes that cost more than most people's rent but look effortlessly casual‚Äîdark jeans, a white button-down, a leather jacket that's broken in just enough to seem authentic. I've learned to dress like them, to move like them, to speak in the casual rhythms of mortals who don't carry the weight of an eternal life in their chest.
The elevator descends in silence, and I watch the numbers count down like a timer to another day of beautiful, aching emptiness. The doorman‚ÄîCarlos, who has a daughter starting college and a wife who makes the best empanadas in Queens‚Äînods as I pass. I know these details because I listen; the small stories of mortal lives have become my only entertainment in my endless, numberless days.
""Beautiful morning, Mr. Solis,"" Carlos says, and I smile because it's true. Every morning is beautiful when you're the son of light itself.
""It is,"" I agree, stepping out onto the sidewalk where the city embraces me with its familiar patterns of chaos.
I walk without a destination, letting my feet carry me through streets that change and evolve while I remain constant. Coffee shops with names like 'Grind' and 'Bean There' have replaced the taverns and tea houses I remember from decades past. Young people tap on devices that would have seemed like magic to the mortals I once knew; their screens glow with a brilliance akin to the sacred fires of Delphi, as if channeling modern oracles through lines of code. Magic has become mundane, and I'm just another face in the crowd.
The park calls to me, as it always does. Central Park, where I can sit among the trees and remember what it felt like to be worshipped, to have temples built in my honor, to be more than just another lonely soul in an endless sea of humanity. I find my usual bench‚Äîthe one with a view of the reservoir, where the water reflects the sky like a mirror.
I pull out a leather journal, its pages filled with poems and songs that no one will ever read. Writing has become my confession, my prayer to a universe that no longer listens to gods. 
Poetry writes itself on these ancient pages, words flowing like a river escaping from a forgotten spring. In each line, I find echoes of voices I once knew and loved, whispers of deities whose laughter was as eternal as the dawn. This journal is my sanctuary, a refuge where time bends to capture fleeting moments of clarity and longing. 
I wonder: Do these inked thoughts pierce the veil of silence that surrounds me? Or do they fall like soft rain on barren soil, lost in the vastness of eternity's landscape? These questions linger unanswered as I search for meaning in a world that has seemingly forgotten the language of the gods.
The pen moves across the page without conscious thought: The pen moves across the page without conscious thought: 
Another morning breaks like a promise
I'm not sure I believe anymore.
The light finds me faithful,
but I am tired of being found.
A jogger passes, earbuds in, lost in her own rhythm. A couple walks by, fingers intertwined, sharing some private joke that makes them both laugh. An old man feeds pigeons from a paper bag, speaking to them in what sounds like Italian. Life continues around me, beautiful and brief and utterly foreign.
I close the journal and lean back against the bench, tilting my face toward the sun. My father's light warms my skin, and for a moment, I can almost pretend I'm not alone. Almost pretend that somewhere in this vast city, there's someone who might see me‚Äîreally see me‚Äîand not run away from what they find.
But that's a dangerous thought, one I've learned to push away before it takes root. Love, for someone like me, is a luxury I can't afford. Not anymore. Not after...
I shake my head, refusing to let those memories surface. The past is a graveyard of hearts I've broken and hearts that have broken me. Better to stay in the present, in this moment of sunlight and solitude, where the only pain is the familiar ache of loneliness.
The morning stretches ahead of me, empty and full of possibility in equal measure. I could go anywhere, do anything, be anyone. But I'll probably just walk home, make another cup of coffee, and stand at my window watching the world turn without me. Yet, there's a whisper of an old memory‚Äîan eclipse, darkness seeping across the sun like spilled ink‚Äîhinting at the cost of my inertia. It's a reminder that choosing safety over purpose may shroud my essence in shadows, obscuring the light within and edging me closer to a void where the eternal hymns that once defined me might fade into silence.
It's a good life, I tell myself. Safe. Predictable. Painless.
It's also slowly killing whatever remains of my divine heart.
But that's tomorrow's problem. Today, I have the sun on my face and words in my journal and the faint hope that maybe, just maybe, something will change.
The light always finds me first. The question is whether I'll ever find anything worth being found for.

So, do I follow through or give up cuz it‚Äôs bad?

1n241eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1n241eh/two_years_after_a_failed_startup_i_got_my_first/,"Two years after a failed startup, I got my first paying user","Since everyone is sharing their stories, I figured I‚Äôd share mine too. I failed at my last startup and then launched a new one.

Two years ago, I started a startup called Taskwer, a mix between TaskRabbit and GoFundMe. The idea was simple: if you needed money fast, you could offer services instead of just asking for donations. I believed in it, spent a year building it and talking to people. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt work out. I missed the product-market fit. I wrote about the whole experience in one of my previous posts. 

Still, something good came out of it. Dozens of people reached out, some just to show support, some shared their own stories, a few even asked me to help them build their projects.

So I started a small agency. I worked with several companies as an outside developer and built a couple of products from scratch for clients. Working on those projects was nice, much less stressful. I could focus on writing code and actually enjoy it again without anxiety about whether an idea would fail.

A couple of months ago, I was talking to a friend who owns a coffee shop. He asked me for help with his website. Some plugin had broken the theme layout, the page wasn‚Äôt mobile-friendly, so he was thinking about getting a new site. 

But all the quotes he got were too expensive, so I built one for him. He only needed a simple static website to show some images, working hours, and contact details. The whole situation got me thinking about the problem I had been noticing for years.

Just like my friend, most small businesses do not need big, complex websites. Most of them just want a simple digital presence, a place where people can find them online, see what they offer, and contact them easily. That's all.

Getting a custom website, even a simple one, is often too expensive. On top of that, these sites usually require regular maintenance, and most owners do not have the time or technical knowledge to handle it.

Some use website builders such as Wix or Squarespace. They are easier than building from scratch, but still require making many design decisions like layouts, colors, fonts, which can feel overwhelming for someone without design experience.

As a result, many small businesses don't even have a website, they stick to Facebook, Google, or other social platforms. They are easy to set up and free, but they do not give owners full control. They work, but they are not truly their own space, and business owners cannot present themselves exactly the way they want.

So I decided to build a platform where small businesses could create their own websites. No coding and no design skills needed. Just pick a theme, add your content, and publish it. That's it. Set it and forget it. Every business would have a website that feels like theirs, professional, reliable, works on any device, and is ready to showcase what they do, without stress, technical headaches, or big costs. A website that takes minutes to build, not weeks. And it should be free.

I shared this idea with some people and they liked it, so I started working on it. I mostly worked on it on weekends and between agency projects. I used Elixir and Phoenix LiveView as the tech stack, created a custom templating language for themes, built dashboards, onboarding, and more. The onboarding was designed so users could add some basic content and have most of their website ready immediately. I also created a few simple single-page themes with the essential components every small business needs: a hero section, list of services, testimonials, and contact details. Users can even connect their custom domain for free. For those who wanted a more customized website, custom components, themes, or help with content, I offered an on-demand service. This way, users could build a free website themselves, and if they wanted something more custom, I could help them at an affordable price. Unlike last time with Taskwer, I didn‚Äôt want to spend a year perfecting it. I built an MVP, which was far from perfect, and started sharing it online to get quick feedback.

Right away, I got some useful feedback and improved a few things. Over the next couple of months, I shared it on social media. A few users came at first, and then more and more started joining. Thousands of them, servers were burning, and money started printing. Well‚Ä¶ not really :) We read this kind of stores all the time, but I‚Äôm not sure how often it actually happens. In reality, some users came, most of them just wanted to see what it was about, and they didn‚Äôt even create their websites. Some did start building one and never completed it but some did complete it and even published their sites.

It felt incredible. Just two hours of work, ‚Ç¨50, but it felt like much more. Someone had actually paid for something I had built. Maybe this is really something worth working on.

I‚Äôm new to the community and I‚Äôm just trying to process a rejection in my life. I (25f) met a girl (24f) on hinge and we hit it off. We have been talking since July but we haven‚Äôt  met yet. When I tried to meet up with her she said she‚Äôd have to check her work schedule. It bummed me out because time has passed and she definitely has a new schedule. She just doesn‚Äôt want to see me. 

II have made polite advances and inquired about a friend‚Äôs with benefits dynamic (I thought commitment may have frightened her). She responded saying  things like ‚Äúoh well I only seek intimacy with partners I know for a long time as it takes me a while to get comfortable, unless you‚Äôre okay with me just laying on my back and doing nothing (pillow princess). And so I dropped it completely and began treating her like only a friend. But it hurt more because I realized she isn‚Äôt even really treating me like a friend. She talks to me about her real friends and deep down I know she wouldn‚Äôt consider me that. She won‚Äôt even meet up for a coffee. 

A week or two passed and she started talking to me about a guy she had been talking to for ‚Äúa long time.‚Äù She told me she had been talking to him for months but I don‚Äôt believe that. Anyway she said they had been sexting for a while and that they were planning to meet up. So long story short they meet up and after sex he tells her he has a gf and says he isn‚Äôt leaving his gf. He then explains to her that he wants her to be his side chick. And believe it or not she accepted that. 

I‚Äôm irritated because she didn‚Äôt ever make a plan to meet up with me even as a friend. She is overlooking me for a sleaze who won‚Äôt even take her out to eat in public. She is overlooking me for a man who is only using her for her body. 

I have developed an emotional connection to her because she is the only person that I‚Äôve been talking to consistently for the last month and a half. I know it doesn‚Äôt seem like a long time but she isn‚Äôt like everyone else. She‚Äôs sincere. And I feel like a dick for writing this but I have no one else to vent to.

1n23yb1,https://i.redd.it/5lrdqoml5plf1.jpeg,Stable couple looking for roommate(s),"Husband and I have been together for 14yrs, he has a son who is 13 who visits and may stay every other weekend with us depending on our work schedules. 

We also own a cattle dog who is 6yrs old and has grown up with cats all of his life, has his trick dog advanced title and his advanced canine good citizen title (we train ALOT). Our dog also does agility, dock diving, fast cat and now we‚Äôre learning treibball so needless to say he stays busy.

Anyways, we are looking for someone or another couple that would be willing to rent a house with us or has a room available for $815 a month. Price is negotiable but looking to stay within 25-35mi of Madison for our work.

I am in school to become certified to train service dogs and graduate in less than a year. I work with my dog a ton, I thoroughly enjoy it! And this also means that I may have a separate dog at any given time either in service training, pet sitting, or daycare for the day. I like to leave a large expo board in the living space for updates, etc. for this reason.

With that being said I also work at a place that offers free dog daycare and boarding so they may go there or they will be traveling with me. I should also note that in the event I have a dog there to train for service, please understand that I would not ever bring a dangerous animal into the home as this is not deemed acceptable for the work it will provide and personally? I hate having to do more work so major behavior issues like aggression or even severe anxiety would cause me to have to recover this animals psyche to then retrain it for work which adds time to the clock. 

So it‚Äôs not a dog that will chew the walls or furniture, cause potty accidents, or other property damage. They won‚Äôt even worry about a cat or two! 

I genuinely enjoy working with people and their dogs, which means I may have training areas set, don‚Äôt be surprised if you get home and find traffic cones in a circle in the living room or toys thrown about. Maybe even agility equipment set in the backyard!

It‚Äôs all work even doing object recognition games (toys on the floor) and having the dog clean it up‚Ä¶anyways most everything has a reason.

Getting 2 sessions in a day is the goal and that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt pick up after myself, however, I like meeting goals. Those goals make me money!

SO is a lead at a senior living facility and works full time, 3 days on, 4 days off.

We backpack, hike, fish, waterfall swimming hikes, art, board games, jigsaws, coffee and sleeping lol we even enjoy finding odd classes to expand interests.

If this sounds like something you‚Äôd be okay or interested in, let‚Äôs talk. There‚Äôs not a timetable, but I‚Äôd like to be out by next year if able. Either way we ewould be ready by October 1st at the earliest.

I don't understand. And it makes me feel not a gamer anymore. But I always will be.

Need advice please.,"Long story long, in April of 2024 my beater Saturn got a cracked engine block and I was managing a food truck at the time and had bad credit so I just googled cheapest AWD car near me and got myself stuck in a 2014 Subaru forester 2.5i premium @18% APR for 23k OTD after taxes fees and GAP. I bought it at 77k miles and it currently has 88k. 

In February of this year my dad was diagnosed with kidney cancer so I went a little crazy and quit the food truck and found a seasonal job halfway across the country to help him move back to the PNW. My next seasonal job is in Antarctica starting in end of September and I won‚Äôt be back to the mainland US until March of next year. In March I‚Äôll be going home for 1 week to unpack all my cold weather gear and heading back to Ohio for my summer seasonal job as I kinda like it and they offered me a huge pay raise to come back, they give me a company truck there. 

I made double payments on the Subaru for about 8 months when I first got it and currently owe about 14.5k, carmax offered me 10k for the car and I don‚Äôt have the 4.5k as I just used all my savings to help my dad move back home across the country. 

Any advice to get out of this? The car has literally been sitting in my moms garage since February of this year and will end up sitting for over a year thankfully I‚Äôve just been having her drive it once a week to go get coffee or run errands. There is nothing wrong with the car just minor paint scratches on the hood from my buddy putting a bag with metal zippers on it. 

Should I go to a traditional dealership and just ask for the worst and cheapest car they have? I‚Äôm currently siting at 760 on Experian and when I bought the Subaru I had a 613 from a hard pull lol. 


tl;dr bought a car almost 2 years ago and a family emergency happened so I left the car halfway across the country in Feb of 2025, got a job in Antarctica and really don‚Äôt want a car anymore as I will have only driven it in January and like 3 weeks of September. Anyways to get out of the 4.5k in negative equity or roll it over into an absolute nightmare of a beater that I can let sit until next year? I can afford the payments I just feel like I‚Äôve absolutely wasted a ton of money this year on a car I‚Äôve only driven for 4 weeks total this year so far. ",1,1756359052.0,askcarsales,4,1.0,False

1n23vu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuddenValley/comments/1n23vu6/some_post_meeting_thoughts/,Some post meeting thoughts,"I am a bit of a thinker. So it takes me a moment to process what I‚Äôm hearing and developing some of my opinions on what‚Äôs happening. After the meeting, I was confused. Confused mostly of the process and how we got here. 

Some questions I have
1. What are peoples definitions of community?

We talked a lot about building community and I‚Äôm not sure everyone is aligned on what that means. 

2. Who is the community?

Numbers were shown of about 1500 kids under 18 and 1200 (I forget the exact number) of people over 65. With 7,700 people in the community how are we addressing the needs of folks 18-64? How are we taking in to account our  desire for community. 

3. What does communicating to the community look like?

As we take into account the next 10-20 years of sudden valley we need to bring our communication standards with technology up to par of how millennials and gen z communicate now. 

I know people air grievances here and on Facebook. Does anyone look at those? Is there a process or place for feedback that can be addressed and made public? Is there an email newsletter going out to make announcements about how to give feedback or show up to events. Are there ways to access notes that are not in difficult PDFs on the website. There was mention of announcements in the paper, which to be blunt is an archaic way of communicating. If we want the community involved we have to meet them where they are at. This could look like pamphlets, going door to door, a forum for communication that‚Äôs online. I know many people work long hours, have kids, and may not even have time to watch a YouTube of the meeting. Which frankly, the meetings are confusing because I don‚Äôt see a linear process that‚Äôs being followed. 


Lastly, I don‚Äôt mean this to be snarky, what is an adult center?

Is it a senior center? Is it building out with good gym equipment? Is it places a for meetings, what kind of meetings? Is this co-working space for the many of us who work remote? Is this shared space for coffee and connection? What is the intention here?

I know I moved here because housing was affordable and it felt like a place to call home as close to nature as I wanted to be. My plan is to be here in 10-20 years. Where will yall be. What is the real future of sudden valley? Cause we are already here. 

Due to the current economy and rates of inflation many of us will never make it to a town hall. Many of the SV residents are renters and the landlords aren‚Äôt showing up. The Airbnb folks may not have the community that lives here full time in mind. 

I didn‚Äôt need more vacation amenities. I love the quiet pool. I don‚Äôt believe any millennials can afford a boat or an airplane. 

It was said that these decisions were designed in the 1970s, during a vastly different economic climate and with greater purchasing power for homes and luxury items.

I wish the beaches were exclusively for residents of Seattle and that the gym had equipment. I  wish the sauna was maintained and not removed by the quiet pool. Simple, sweet, and not overly complicated.

One more thing: if you‚Äôre from the Pacific Northwest, you‚Äôd use a pavilion during the winter. We could have covered farmers‚Äô markets throughout the year, a place for children to play in a covered space, and perhaps even a place to see Santa or drink hot cocoa when the tree lighting goes up (I guarantee people would enjoy being outdoors during the rain for this).

These are just a few of my thoughts after processing them.

Adrian¬†leaned¬†back¬†in¬†his¬†chair¬†while¬†his¬†amber¬†eyes¬†remained¬†

fixed¬†on¬†Noelle¬†as¬†she¬†absentmindedly¬†drizzled¬†syrup¬†over¬†her¬†

pancake.¬†

‚ÄúStop¬†staring¬†and¬†eat,‚Äù¬†Noelle¬†said¬†with¬†a¬†laugh¬†as¬†she¬†caught¬†his¬†

Adrian¬†smirked¬†and¬†rested¬†his¬†chin¬†on¬†his¬†hand.¬†‚ÄúCan‚Äôt¬†help¬†it.¬†

You‚Äôre¬†prettier¬†than¬†breakfast.‚Äù¬†Noelle¬†rolled¬†her¬†eyes,¬†but¬†a¬†

Before¬†Adrian¬†could¬†respond,¬†his¬†phone¬†vibrated¬†on¬†the¬†table¬†

and¬†the¬†screen¬†lit¬†up¬†with¬†Miles‚Äò¬†name.¬†Adrian¬†let¬†out¬†a¬†groan¬†

while¬†his¬†smile¬†faded¬†as¬†he¬†picked¬†up¬†the¬†phone.¬†

‚ÄúDo¬†you¬†have¬†to¬†ruin¬†my¬†morning¬†already,¬†Miles?‚Äù¬†Adrian¬†

grumbled,¬†holding¬†the¬†phone¬†to¬†his¬†ear.¬†

‚ÄúGood¬†morning¬†to¬†you¬†too,¬†sunshine,‚Äù¬†Miles¬†replied,¬†his¬†voice¬†

brisk.¬†‚ÄúI¬†need¬†you¬†at¬†AMN,¬†now.‚Äù¬†

Adrian‚Äôs¬†brows¬†furrowed.¬†‚ÄúI¬†just¬†got¬†home¬†last¬†night.¬†Can‚Äôt¬†it¬†

Adrian¬†pinched¬†the¬†bridge¬†of¬†his¬†nose.¬†He¬†glanced¬†at¬†Noelle¬†who¬†

was¬†quietly¬†sipping¬†her¬†coffee¬†but¬†watching¬†him¬†with¬†an¬†

understanding¬†smile.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm¬†not¬†interested,¬†Miles,‚Äù¬†Adrian¬†said¬†while¬†leaning¬†back¬†in¬†his¬†

He¬†looked¬†at¬†Noelle¬†again,¬†silently¬†apologizing¬†with¬†his¬†eyes.¬†But¬†

Noelle¬†only¬†smiled¬†softly¬†while¬†nodding¬†her¬†head¬†in¬†silent¬†

encouragement.¬†

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù¬†Adrian¬†finally¬†said¬†but¬†still¬†a¬†little¬†reluctant.¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôll¬†be¬†there¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs¬†okay.¬†I¬†know¬†how¬†important¬†your¬†work¬†is.¬†Go¬†on¬†and¬†

Adrian¬†sighed,¬†standing¬†up¬†and¬†walked¬†around¬†the¬†table¬†to¬†

plant¬†a¬†kiss¬†on¬†the¬†top¬†of her¬†head.‚Äù¬†

At¬†least¬†let¬†me¬†drive¬†you¬†to¬†the¬†bridal¬†shop¬†you¬†mentioned¬†to¬†me¬†

‚ÄúYou¬†said¬†you¬†wanted¬†to¬†pick¬†out¬†your¬†dress.‚Äù¬†

Noelle‚Äôs¬†lips¬†curled¬†into¬†a¬†smile¬†as¬†she¬†looked¬†up¬†at¬†him.¬†‚ÄúYou¬†

Adrian¬†smirked,¬†crouching¬†down¬†beside¬†her chair¬†so¬†their¬†eyes¬†

met.¬†‚ÄúI¬†can¬†handle¬†Miles.¬†But¬†you?¬†You‚Äôre¬†my¬†priority‚Äù¬†

Her¬†heart¬†softened¬†at¬†his¬†words,¬†but¬†she¬†still¬†shook¬†her¬†head¬†

gently.¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôll¬†be¬†fine.¬†Grace¬†is¬†meeting¬†me¬†there,¬†remember?¬†You¬†

focus¬†on¬†this¬†big¬†project.¬†We‚Äôll¬†have¬†plenty¬†of¬†time¬†later¬†to¬†argue¬†

Adrian‚Äôs¬†amber¬†eyes¬†narrowed¬†in¬†playful¬†protest.¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre¬†really¬†

She¬†chuckled,¬†brushing¬†her¬†fingers¬†along¬†his¬†cheek.¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre¬†not¬†supposed¬†to¬†see¬†the¬†dress¬†before¬†the¬†wedding¬†anyway,¬†Mr.¬†

Blackwood.¬†Isn‚Äôt¬†that¬†bad¬†luck?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSuperstition,‚Äù¬†Adrian¬†countered¬†with¬†a¬†grin,¬†but¬†he¬†sighed¬†in¬†surrender.¬†‚ÄúFine.¬†But¬†I‚Äôm¬†holding¬†you¬†to¬†a¬†full¬†recap¬†when¬†I¬†get¬†

back.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDeal,‚Äù¬†she said¬†with¬†a¬†laugh,¬†leaning¬†in¬†to¬†press¬†a¬†soft¬†kiss¬†to¬†his¬†lips.¬†‚ÄúNow¬†go¬†before¬†Miles¬†calls¬†again¬†and¬†yells¬†at¬†you.‚Äù¬†

Reluctantly,¬†Adrian¬†stood,¬†grabbing¬†his¬†jacket¬†and¬†keys.¬†He¬†

turned¬†back¬†to¬†her¬†as¬†he¬†reached¬†the¬†door.¬†‚ÄúText¬†me¬†as¬†soon¬†as¬†

Noelle¬†shook¬†her¬†head,¬†amused¬†by¬†his¬†concern.¬†‚ÄúI¬†promise.¬†Go¬†on¬†

With¬†one¬†last¬†lingering¬†glance,¬†Adrian¬†left¬†as¬†the¬†sound¬†of¬†the¬†

door¬†clicking¬†shut¬†echoed¬†through¬†the house.¬†Noelle¬†exhaled¬†deeply¬†while¬†her¬†fingers¬†brushed¬†against¬†her¬†lips¬†where¬†his¬†kiss.¬†

lingered,¬†before¬†finishing¬†her¬†coffee.¬†

Grace¬†stood¬†outside¬†of¬†the¬†bridal¬†shop¬†while¬†keeping¬†her¬†eyes¬†on¬†

her¬†watch.¬†The¬†soft¬†clinking¬†of¬†her¬†bracelets¬†echoed¬†faintly¬†as¬†



she¬†crossed her¬†arms¬†and¬†tapped¬†her¬†heel¬†against¬†the¬†pavement.¬†

And¬†when¬†she¬†spotted¬†Noelle¬†approaching¬†in¬†her¬†usual¬†shirt¬†

and¬†fitted¬†pants,¬†Grace¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†help¬†but¬†let¬†out¬†a¬†light¬†laughter.¬†

‚ÄúYou¬†know,¬†you‚Äôre¬†probably¬†the¬†only¬†bride‚Äìto‚Äìbe¬†in¬†the¬†city¬†who¬†

Noelle¬†shrugged¬†with¬†a¬†shy¬†smile¬†as¬†she¬†reached¬†Grace.¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs¬†

wrong¬†with¬†being¬†comfortable?¬†I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†know¬†I¬†needed¬†to¬†dress¬†

up¬†to¬†try¬†on¬†dresses.‚Äù‚Äù¬†

Grace¬†shook¬†her¬†head,¬†still¬†smiling¬†as¬†she¬†linked¬†her¬†arm¬†with¬†

Noelle‚Äôs.¬†‚ÄúThere‚Äôs¬†nothing¬†wrong¬†with¬†it,¬†Elle.¬†I¬†just‚Ä¶¬†admire¬†how¬†

sneakers.¬†‚ÄúI¬†heard¬†Adrian¬†spoilt¬†you¬†with¬†everything.‚Äù‚Äù¬†

Noelle¬†rolled¬†her¬†eyes¬†as¬†her¬†smile¬†softened.¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt remind¬†me.¬†

Grace let¬†out¬†a¬†laugh.¬†‚ÄúOh,¬†I¬†can¬†picture¬†that.¬†But¬†you¬†know¬†him,¬†

he‚Äôs¬†not¬†just¬†an¬†actor.¬†He‚Äôs¬†practically¬†a¬†one‚Äìman¬†empire.¬†I¬†swear,¬†

Noelle‚Äôs¬†steps¬†faltered¬†slightly¬†and¬†glanced¬†at¬†Grace.¬†‚ÄúEmpire?¬†

What¬†are¬†you¬†talking¬†about?‚Äù¬†

Grace¬†froze¬†for¬†a¬†split¬†second¬†as¬†she¬†realized¬†her¬†slip.¬†But¬†she¬†

further.¬†‚ÄúWell,¬†I¬†still¬†wish¬†he‚Äôd¬†tone¬†it¬†down.¬†I¬†don‚Äôt¬†need¬†all¬†of¬†

Grace‚Äôs¬†smile¬†softened¬†at¬†her¬†friend‚Äôs¬†words.¬†Noelle‚Äôs¬†humility¬†

and¬†sincerity¬†were¬†exactly¬†why¬†she¬†and¬†Adrian¬†adored¬†her¬†so¬†

much.¬†Looping¬†their¬†arms¬†together¬†again,¬†Grace¬†tugged¬†her¬†

toward¬†the¬†bridal¬†shop.¬†‚ÄúCome¬†on,¬†let‚Äôs¬†find¬†you¬†the¬†dress¬†of¬†

surprise.¬†She¬†then¬†laughed¬†nervously¬†as¬†her¬†eyes¬†darted¬†around¬†

and mannequins¬†adorned¬†in¬†the¬†finest¬†silk¬†gowns¬†exuded¬†

luxury¬†at¬†every¬†corner.¬†Her¬†gaze¬†landed¬†on¬†a¬†dress¬†with¬†

intricate¬†beading,¬†and¬†her¬†jaw¬†dropped¬†when¬†she¬†spotted¬†the¬†

price¬†tag.¬†

‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶¬†these¬†are¬†beautiful‚Ä¶¬†and expensive!‚Äù¬†she¬†exclaimed,¬†her¬†

tone¬†rising¬†in¬†mild¬†panic.¬†‚ÄúWhy¬†would¬†you¬†bring¬†me¬†here?!‚Äù¬†

1n23hlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1n23hlb/ive_stopped_tracking_my_calories/,I‚Äôve stopped tracking my calories,"Context, I‚Äôve managed to lose about 55 lbs in one year (around 24/25kgs). My starting weight was 172 lbs (78 kgs ) and my height is 5‚Äù2 (157 ish cm). I gained a lot of weight due to back to back pregnancies + Covid and only really started getting into the grind once I stopped breastfeeding my youngest around August last year. 

At the beginning I was really mindful of logging things into MFP; but I stopped doing that around April this year.

And so far? I am still maintaining my current weight! (118 lbs / 53.8 kgs). Things that I do consistently:


- i don‚Äôt drink my calories. I stick to water, black coffee, unsweetened tea and the occasional coke zero.

- I cut back on my alcohol intake by A LOT (i used to go out drinking 2-3 days a week. I now only drink once a fortnight and sticking to whiskey neat or on the rocks; no more than three glasses a night).

- I avoid desserts unless it‚Äôs being served to me when I visit someone‚Äôs house. When that happens, I just take a bite or two to be polite, and would give the rest to my husband ( who is genetically blessed with height and will never gain weight no matter how much he‚Äôd eat üò¥)

- Most importantly: PORTION CONTROL. I eyeball a lot of what I eat and I‚Äôm very mindful of how much for volume I put on my plate. I don‚Äôt restrict what I eat at all. I still eat noodles, rice, pasta etc but instead of having one whole plate of noodles, I would eat 1/4-1/2 of it. 

- I exercise a lot. I play tennis 5 days a week, burning an average of 400 ish calories (according to my apple watch) on 1 hour of tennis. I can burn up to 800 cals+ if I do a two hour session. I also do weights 2x a week (progressive loading of back squats, front squats, cleans, clean & jerk and deadlifts)

Granted I‚Äôve only stropped tracking/ logging for four months ish now and am wondering if I can still maintain my current weight with what has worked for me so far? 

Due to the nature of my job, I tend to eat out a lot (networking or external meetings) so consistently tracking is not something that is sustainable for me.


Just wondering if anyone else on this sub do this? That once you achieve your goal weight, you stop counting your macros/micros/cals and weighing your food? How long have you gone on without tracking your food and you manage to keep the weight off?

Whether it‚Äôs to benefit ourselves or not we‚Äôll offer help to people we know don‚Äôt need it. The kindness we show to people often goes against our instincts.

Humans are also innately selfish. We often rationalize in our brains that we are the center of the world. I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs really a flaw and I understand why we think that way. Our brains job is to keep us alive, therefore it‚Äôs our needs above all else. 

In the end, we are selfishly compassionate. We love each other to feel love for ourselves, humans thrive off of the kindness offered by people who aren‚Äôt ourselves. We care for others in the same ways we care for most things, it serves us so we love it. It happens when we don‚Äôt realize it. You love your house because it provides you comfort, you love your bed because it gives you a soft sleep at night, you love your car because it means you don‚Äôt have to walk. We hate what doesn‚Äôt give. You hate that crack in the sidewalk because it disrupts the flat pavement you love walking on, you hate the sharp turn in your way to work because you seem to just barely graze the curb every time, you hate when the Wi-Fi is a little slower than usual. This is the same principle across society. You hate the noisy upstairs neighbors, you hate your stuck up boss, you hate the annoying kid in the back of the class who always seems to catch you on a bad day. But you‚Äôre told to love thy neighbor, treat them as your own, give them grace because you don‚Äôt know what their going through. So you focus on how you love that one friend who hugs you when they see you, how you love that one barista who always puts extra foam on your coffee, how you love your mother because she‚Äôs always been there to dry your tears. Yet, what you fail to realize is that you were the noisy neighbor when you were dancing to your music while cleaning, you were the annoying kid in class, you were the stuck up boss but you were also the friend who always gave hugs, you were the barista who always out a little more foam, and maybe one day you‚Äôll be the one wiping tears from your child‚Äôs eyes. So maybe next time, take that turn a little wider, step over the crack in the side walk, open your home to those less fortunate and maybe even give someone a ride every now and then.

I only had four friends, one of them being my boyfriend, but I had a good thing going. I worked on-campus about 20 hours a week that I really liked and made pretty good money since minimum wage in my college town was high ($18 an hour). I was acing my classes and in the honors capstone competition, which my professor touted as an amazing way to get interviews in my field (public relations). Spoiler alert: it was not. I found a hobby i did twice a week and loved. I was excited for post-grad and finding a job. 

And then this May, I graduated. The past 100+ days have consisted of the brutal murder of any self worth I had. I got a contract job about two weeks after graduation with a wedding planning service, which has given me zero events to work on in the past three months, aka zero income. I‚Äôve applied to about 200~ jobs ranging from ‚Äújobs that are actually related to the degree i just spent the past four years working on‚Äù to ‚Äúcustodian at an alternative school‚Äù. Every public relations job has either ghosted me or sent an automatic rejection letter, so I am essentially doomed to part-time customer service type gigs. I have different resumes for what I‚Äôm applying to. I write a different cover letter every time. I‚Äôve had 6 interviews, 3 of which have resulted in ghosting, 3 of good old fashioned rejection. I got rejected from Starbucks a few weeks ago, with Starbucks on my resume! I‚Äôm getting auto-rejections from receptionist jobs even though my college job that I had for 3 years was, you guessed it, receptionist. 

No one in my life is sympathetic about my job search anymore. My boyfriend‚Äôs apathetic, my parents are itching to get me off of their payroll (they were originally going to cut me off financially in May, but gave me a few months grace because of the garbage fire job market I graduated into), and my few friends cant relate. My best friend graduated at the same time with a nursing degree, and got a job about a week into applying, while my other best friend with no college degree sent one job app this month, and got it. My life is at a standstill. I can‚Äôt go out unless I‚Äôm with my boyfriend, who works nights, because who else would pay? During the day, I sit in the living room and only leave every few hours to walk our dog. Everyday since May has felt like I‚Äôm sleepwalking. I‚Äôm angry every day, and the urge to puke hasn‚Äôt left me in weeks. Every small joy in my life has had to be put on pause until I have an income. A coffee run? Nope. Thrift store? Nope. Dance lessons? Gone. My peacock subscription so I can binge crappy reality TV? Forget about it. And every cover letter and interview I have grin and act like I want their job for anything other than money. Oh yes it‚Äôs been my dream since I was a little girl to work as a part-time hostess at your overpriced brunch restaurant chain.

Anxiety doesn't go away overnight; it can be managed with skills and habits that reduce stress and restore balance to the mind and body. Here's a focused list of 13 skills you can gradually add to your routine:

Smart Time Management
Divide your day into short blocks (e.g., 25 minutes of focus + 5 minutes of rest). If something is holding you back, limit it to the first 5 minutes.

Clear Boundaries
Learn to say ""no,"" activate Do Not Disturb during sensitive periods, and set work and rest hours.

Seek Support
Contact a friend, support group, or therapist. Even a simple comment here can change your mood.

Small Daily Movement
A 10-minute walk/stretch is enough to reduce stress and release endorphins.

 Breathing turns off the alarm
Box Breathing: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4 (3‚Äì4 cycles).

Cut down on caffeine and sugar
Replace that extra cup of coffee with herbal tea/water. Observe what triggers your heart rate.

Sleep hygiene
Same time to go to bed/wake up, natural light in the morning, no screens for an hour before bed.

Be kind to yourself
Replace ""I failed"" with ""I learned."" Harsh words prolong anxiety.

Reframing
Sol: Where's the evidence? What's worse/better/most likely? Give your mind a balanced perspective.

Paper dump
5-minute ""brain dump"" + set 3 small priorities for the day. Paper carries the weight instead of your brain.

 Gradual Exposure
Break down the fear into micro-steps (1% courage every day is better than 100% once and never again).

Nerve Maintenance Routine
A glass of water + a ray of sunshine + making your bed = small gains that fill energy drains.

Anxiety First Aid Plan
A simple card: A) Breathe, B) Move for a minute, C) Connect with someone/Comment here. Keep it in your pocket/Phone Notes.",2,1756356232.0,CPTSD,2,1.0,False

Edit: Yes, my husband backed me up. He is awesome üòä She started excluding me from family gatherings by scheduling them when she knew I couldn't get off work. Then , she accused us of being ""unsafe"" and claimed that she said those things because she is neurodivergent.

Edit 2; yes, the rest of the family all know. They want us all to ""just get along""

Edit 3 - yes, I am Jewish, although most people who don't know me guess Korean. Hubby and I got genetic counseling. If we only checked for the Ashkenazi panel, we would have missed the condition that we both actually carry that has nothing to do with my Jewish heritage.

Update (sort of) - about 18 months ago, she gave us her used baby stuff. We were planning to have a baby but not yet pregnant, but we figured free stuff so we took it. We just had a baby and I went through the boxes. Half the stuff she gave us was used cloth diapers. Now we have 3 trash bags of used diapers that we can't even give to Goodwill so we have to take them to the dump. She claimed that the stuff she gave us counts as a baby shower present. Yes, she can afford an actual present. She just bought a designer cat for thousands of dollars. We told her that we would even appreciate a gift card for like 25, as it would show more thought and effort than just cleaning out her garage. She got offended and called my husband a f\*\*\*wad

Edit 4, SIL sent the photos to her friend ""Jenny"" and then told my husband ""Jenny said OP looks Jewish."" I don't btw. Even if we all looked alike. I'm mixed race and I look Asian. I found a friend who wanted the cloth diapers so I didn't throw them away. Thanks for the suggestions!

Update - SIL sent some baby presents addressed from her kids. In the words of the immortal Mandy Patinkin, ""Don't use your kids like that. It's shameful."" I am used to a lifetime of ""where are you originally from"" and ""do you have a green card."" I usually assume that the person is ignorant rather than malicious. What gets me with my SIL is the complete lack of accountability and self reflection. Like, she doesn't have to do any work on herself or accept criticism because she is neurodivergent and has kids. You all have given me and hubby something to think about. We appreciate your support and encouragement.

Update - MIL pressured SIL to make amends. SIL invited me over to her house for coffee. She told me that she's not her parents and she doesn't judge people based on how they look. (Her parents have been nothing but kind to me.) She also said she would never have said those things if my husband told her I have been dealing with racism my whole life.

TLDR is that I told a girl who is both more than a decade younger than me, and is also a coworker that I wouldn't date her, and then later I hugged her when she was upset after being sexually harassed, and now she is behaving really weirdly and I don't know how to navigate this situation. 

Longer version: I came back to my home country (within the EEA) after a month long vacation abroad a bit over two months ago, and soon after went to a staff party at a night club I've been working at for years. At the staff party I met a girl from a different EEA country that recently moved here and was hired at the club. I talked to her (not at all in a flirty way, or at least  I don't think I did) quite a bit during the party. For context, I'm a guy, and one of the older employees at that club being 33 years old, and she is one of the youngest at 22.

A couple of days after the party she added me on Facebook, and asked if I could help her arrange a doctor's appointment because she needed medication. Having been an immigrant myself in the past and knowing how complicated it can be to navigate a new country, I decided to help her. It went pretty normally, I met her for a coffee first and then walked with her to the walk-in clinic and just waited in the waiting room while she saw a doctor. When she was done she offered to buy me lunch to say thanks and I accepted it. We ended up having some beers at the club after we finished lunch and some time later she  told me that a guy that works with us was jealous of me for hanging out with her because he wanted to sleep with her. 

This was the first sign of her being interested in me romantically that I noticed, but I've been known to be hopelessly clueless so there probably were other hints earlier. I was already a bit tipsy, but I straight up told her that the guy had no reason to be jealous because while I enjoyed her company I had no interest in either dating her or sleeping with her. She laughed it off and said she agreed and that we should just be friends, and that she understood it because I had recently gotten out of a long term relationship (something I had mentioned during the staff party), to which I responded by saying that wasn't really the reason, she simply is too young and we work together, so it would feel wrong to be involved with her. 

She didn't seem to like that last part. She got distant and didn't really talk to me for a few hours, and we both just started talking to different coworkers, but when I decided to go home and was saying goodbye to everyone (I had gotten quite drunk at that point) she asked me to join her for a cigarette before I left and I agreed. While we're smoking she asked me if it was really her age or if I just didn't think she was attractive. I remember thinking there were no correct answers to this question, but I stupidly said that it was really just her age and that she could ask me out in a few years if she really wanted to. She called me a pig and stormed back inside. 

I didn't talk to her again until we had a shift together a couple of days later. When I showed up for work she apologized to me and asked me if I thought it was awkward working with her after our our last encounter, but I just told her not to worry about it, that we both had been drunk and it was a stupid conflict. Then I set up the outdoor bar while she was sent to work at the upstairs bar (there are four bars in that club) and we both just started working. Later that shift some guy sexually harassed her, repeatedly grabbed her ass during her smoke break and then followed her to the bar while saying creepy shit, and our shift manager asked me to help one of the bouncers to kick him out (I'm a big guy). Once the creep was out the door I went upstairs to check on her because she had been crying. I stayed with her for some time hugging her while she cried into my chest. Eventually she stopped crying and asked our shift manager if she could swap with the guy that had been with me outside because she felt safer working outside with me than working upstairs by herself, and the shift manager agreed.

Nothing really noteworthy happened after that, but ever since that shift she has been going back and forth between either asking me for local advice and sending me sweet messages (which I try not to engage with) on the one hand, or  calling me while being emotional to tell me she doesn't think we should ""keep communicating"", on the other hand (to which I have always responded by saying that I understand and that I'll respect her boundaries). 

Every time I think this is over, she will send me a cute meme or ask me where she can get something in the city, then keep texting me for a few days before eventually calling me to tell me that she can't continue talking to me.

 I'm at my wits end. I'm feeling guilty for rejecting her, but I  still don't want to date a 22 year old. I don't want to complain about her to my boss, because this is her only job at the moment and she doesn't have a safety net in this country, while this job is just a side gig for me (that I still genuinely like and don't want to quit), and she genuinely is a good worker that gets along with everyone else at the bar. Bunch of the guys working there are really into her, but she has no interest in them. Trying to be friendly with her seems to make her miserable. 

How do I get this girl to move on from me? I feel like my choices are to either quit the job or just give up and sleep with her. I want neither. ",1,1756355966.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1n230z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1n230z0/recovered_but_restrictive/,Recovered but restrictive,"Hello there, I'm looking for some advice :). 

I have been recovered from anorexia for over 9 years now but I just realized that I'm not totally recovered, I just replaced it with restrictive eating which I didn't know was a disorder till recently..

The restrictive eating is largely due to the fear that food will make me gain weight. And I feel fat everyday, still always pinching my thighs and side, looking for ribs and getting upset when they're too faint for my linking. 

Food feel stupid- I never feel hungry and so eating food feels stupid and makes me feel like a cow when I feel full. I really only make myself full one meal of the day and that's dinner and I always feel disgusted with myself when I feel ""fullness"". 

I'm also afraid to eat certain foods, thinking that simply because I ate the food, I'll going to get fat. I don't allow myself to enjoy much really but I also just find enjoyment in real whole foods more anyways, as far as mind and body goes. I enjoy apples and peanut butter, it's a daily staple and ik vegetarian so I try to get some protein in somehow but really I only eat an apple maybe some nuts and nut better all day and I'm fine, not hungry . Then if and when my husband is home from work, I'll cook dinner and having him around makes eating feel less stupid. Typically I'll cook something containing a well rounded variety of veggies, possibly a grain like rice and protein. Beans or tofu usually or chicken for him but I don't eat meat. I always stay within portion sizes too. I might have two servings of beans and one serving of rice but like, I don't just mindlessly eat, I'm always aware of the portions. But When I eat with him I get really full and feel gross but less guilty in the company of another. But most nights I'm home alone with my toddler and there's no point in cooking dinner because I really don't want that much food and my daughter just picks. So if it's just me, I'll likely just eat another apple and some nuts and call it a day . 

So my questions are these: 

Why am I never hungry? If my body needs food, why doesn't it tell me?  Will I ever get ginger curs again?

My bowels don't work and haven't since I recovered. If I don't drink coffee I screwed and anymore I love off of miralax. Why does it seem like my bowls are paralyzed?

Am I at a good weight for my height, age and body type? I have muscle in my legs but not a ton elsewhere. I always lose about ,4-5lbs in the winter when I run less. 

Will eating a cinnamon roll one time in the course of 6 months make me gain weight if my metabolism is slow? 

How would you eat if you were me? Considering I'm female,going on 31 years soon, athletic build, 5'2"", about 110lbs (I feel better at 106 though...) I squeeze in runs a few days a week when I can, typically hill paths for 3-5 miles and I'm pretty active, as I don't really sit down until the end of the night. Just piddle around all day doing a bunch of things.

How would you eat, taking those things into consideration? 

Can you give me some Example of meal plans? Even if I try to eat more, I don't know how often or what or even how much I should eat. And I know for a fact that I don't feel good if I eat too many calories. I feel best at 1200-1400, anything more than that feels overdone. 

I'm almost vegan, not that I care to differentiates but I'll eat almost any whole food other than meat and extremely little dairy with cheese being the only form 

I just don't want to be afraid to eat and I hate that I can't let myself enjoy things without being paranoid afterwards the whole time, and feeling like I have to ""punish"" myself by restricting more or running for the next few days all because I had a pastry for the first time in three months. And I absolutely hate eating when I have no apptititte. It just makes food seem so good and me so disgusting.

1n22xvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1n22xvg/am_i_terrible_father_i_feel_crazy/,Am I terrible father? I feel crazy.,"My now ex‚Ä¶again, thinks I‚Äôm the worst parent ever and I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. I just don‚Äôt understand. I know it‚Äôs my problem and I let it effect me, but I‚Äôm stressed to the max being around her after 2.5 years of this‚Ä¶Me and my ex broke up 2 months ago..again and I‚Äôm over it. For 6 months I had 50/50. Nothing bad ever happened. Yet going through it again‚Ä¶

I‚Äôll give you an example: (only the first 1/3 of this post is to me, relevant, but I listed out more examples if you‚Äôd like to read them. 

Our daughter wanted to go outside, my ex said no. I told her I‚Äôm not keeping her cooped up in the house. So we went. she sent me several texts about ticks being outside, sends texts about making sure I‚Äôm not letting her in the drainage pond. Not letting her near the tall grass, etc and then went to the deck and just stared us down until we came back inside.

I feel like there‚Äôs absolutely no logical reasoning in what she‚Äôs requesting of me. For this example, sure, we have ticks. The ticks can carry ‚ÄúColorado tick fever‚Äù but my google search says ‚ÄúThe risk of Colorado Tick Fever (CTF) is considered low, though not zero, with only a few confirmed cases reported recently in the state‚Äù so we‚Äôre just suppose to keep our daughter in the house because there‚Äôs a near 0% chance she can get bit by a tick and get Colorado tick fever? For real? 

I pull up data and try to use logic explaining that we drive in a car which carries a risk SIGNIFICANTLY higher than anything else she‚Äôs upset with me about‚Ä¶yet she‚Äôs still right, persistent, etc. I have listed 2 more valid concerns that could maybe indicate why she might think I‚Äôm a terrible parent. After a repetitive cycle of these incidents almost daily for over 2 years, I question if my thinking is flawed and I am just not protective enough? I need some validation from others that I‚Äôm not crazy for thinking it‚Äôs her issue and not me. Or maybe I am? Idk‚Ä¶
 



Here‚Äôs a list of more examples if anybody is interested: all of this is related to our daughter. 

Being together, we had some mice, (we live on 2 acres) there was mouse poop in the corner next to the stuffed animals. I told her we‚Äôd wash them. She said no that it‚Äôs contaminated and she proceeded to throw them all away‚Ä¶it can‚Äôt be cleaned? 

Then she tells me she can‚Äôt play on the tramp‚Ä¶I told her she already has‚Ä¶she‚Äôs pissed, freaking out then I show her the video and she says ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs an in-ground tramp‚Äù she lived there for 4 MONTHS and didn‚Äôt know the tramp was in the ground!? For real? 

I drop our kid off later at daycare later than she does. It‚Äôs a huge deal because I‚Äôm ‚Äúmessing up our daughter‚Äôs schedule‚Äù I let our daughter dress herself, pick out her clothes, climb herself in the car seat, drive with me to get coffee. The baby sitter didn‚Äôt care, I pay the same regardless, why is it a big deal? 

Her bedtime is 9..I rolled in at 9:20 on a Saturday night. I get it, past her bed time. But she was overly MAD. Sending me multiple texts about when was I going to be home‚Ä¶like soonish? Idk‚Ä¶

I wanted to take her out on the boat‚Ä¶she said no because ‚Äúit‚Äôs not safe‚Äù we‚Äôre not even together and I INVITED HER. Still no. do they not make life jackets for a reason? She‚Äôll be 3 in December. 

This one I understand better‚Ä¶but still doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm being a bad parent here. I took a picture of our daughter on the auto pool cover at my cousins house. She calls me freaking out telling me I‚Äôm not watching her. I literally took the picture‚Ä¶then says ‚Äúwell were you on the grass with her?‚Äù No, I was on the back deck on the second story‚Ä¶‚Äùwell then you weren‚Äôt watching her‚Äù keep in mind, I built that pool. The auto cover is rated for over 2500 pounds weight capacity. You can drive an ATV on it. There‚Äôs also 4 kids downstairs from the ages of 10-16 and 2 19 year olds‚Ä¶along with alarms if that auto cover opens. (My cousin is an av guy and the whole house is smart/automated) 

Some things I do if you‚Äôve read this far that I can see as a concern: 

I use zyns and the used ones got left on my night stand or coffee table. On a napkin..I stopped doing that‚Ä¶until I broke my pelvis 5 weeks ago and couldn‚Äôt get up to throw them away when I laid down‚Ä¶(she‚Äôs never tried to put it in her mouth but I get it, it‚Äôs a risk) 

My Milwaukee knives get left on the bathroom counter or my desk. Yes she can reach them. No she doesn‚Äôt try to open them and up until this point, she can‚Äôt open it. (I took the blades out of the knives and let her have it) it felt like it would cure her curiosity and since then, she has no interest in them. 

Those are the only 2 things that get brought up when I mention to her there‚Äôs no good reason she shouldn‚Äôt trust me.

Tooth sensitivity can transform a simple pleasure like enjoying a hot coffee or cold ice cream into a painful experience. If you've ever winced when biting into something cold or felt a sharp pain while brushing your teeth, you're not alone. Millions of people struggle with tooth sensitivity, a common dental issue that can significantly impact daily life and overall comfort. Understanding the underlying causes and discovering effective relief strategies is crucial for maintaining optimal oral health and enjoying your favorite foods and drinks without discomfort.

Understanding Tooth Sensitivity: What's Really Going On?

Tooth sensitivity occurs when the protective layers of your teeth become compromised, exposing the delicate nerve endings underneath. This exposure can lead to sharp, temporary pain when encountering certain stimuli like temperature changes, sweet or acidic foods, and even brushing.

Common Causes of Tooth Sensitivity

1. Enamel Erosion
Tooth enamel is the hard, protective outer layer of your teeth. When this layer wears down, it exposes the underlying dentin, which contains microscopic tubules leading directly to the tooth's nerve center.

Click here to get your teeth and gums restored naturally prodentimofficalsite.carrd.co

Factors contributing to enamel erosion include:
‚Ä¢ Acidic foods and drinks
‚Ä¢ Aggressive brushing
‚Ä¢ Teeth grinding
‚Ä¢ Acid reflux
‚Ä¢ Age-related wear

2. Gum Recession
When gums pull away from teeth, they expose tooth roots, which are extremely sensitive. This can happen due to:
‚Ä¢ Periodontal disease
‚Ä¢ Aggressive brushing
‚Ä¢ Poor oral hygiene
‚Ä¢ Genetic predisposition

3. Dental Procedures
Certain dental treatments can temporarily increase tooth sensitivity:
‚Ä¢ Teeth whitening
‚Ä¢ Fillings
‚Ä¢ Crowns
‚Ä¢ Professional cleaning

Identifying Sensitivity Triggers

Understanding what causes your tooth sensitivity is the first step toward finding relief. Common triggers include:
‚Ä¢ Extremely hot or cold temperatures
‚Ä¢ Sweet or acidic foods
‚Ä¢ Cold air
‚Ä¢ Brushing and flossing
‚Ä¢ Sugary drinks

Effective Relief Strategies

Professional Treatments
1. Dental Bonding
Dentists can apply a protective resin to sensitive areas, creating a barrier against stimuli.

2. Fluoride Treatments
Professional fluoride applications strengthen tooth enamel and reduce sensitivity.

3. Gum Grafting
For severe gum recession, this surgical procedure can cover exposed roots.

Home Remedies and Prevention

Desensitizing Toothpaste
Look for toothpastes containing potassium nitrate or strontium chloride, which help block pain signals from the tooth surface to nerves.

Soft-Bristled Toothbrush
Use a gentle brushing technique with a soft-bristled brush to prevent further enamel damage.

Dietary Modifications
‚Ä¢ Limit acidic foods and drinks
‚Ä¢ Use a straw when consuming acidic beverages
‚Ä¢ Rinse mouth with water after eating

Oral Hygiene Best Practices
‚Ä¢ Brush twice daily with proper technique
‚Ä¢ Floss regularly
‚Ä¢ Use fluoride mouthwash
‚Ä¢ Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months

When to See a Dentist

While many cases of tooth sensitivity can be managed at home, persistent or severe pain requires professional evaluation. Schedule a dental appointment if you experience:
‚Ä¢ Prolonged sensitivity lasting more than a few weeks
‚Ä¢ Pain that interrupts sleep
‚Ä¢ Sensitivity accompanied by visible damage
‚Ä¢ Unexplained swelling or inflammation

Conclusion

Tooth sensitivity is a common yet manageable condition. By understanding its causes, implementing preventive strategies, and seeking professional guidance when needed, you can significantly reduce discomfort and protect your dental health. Remember, everyone's mouth is unique, so what works for one person might not work for another. Patience, consistent oral care, and professional dental support are key to finding your path to a pain-free, sensitive-free smile.",1,1756355321.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

Posting from a burner account due to how many people know my real account. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't get my wife to want to be intimate with me no matter what I do. I find her amazingly beautiful and love to caress and love on her but it always ends with a ""no"". The last time we did stuff was after I had to bribe her with coffee for several days. And before people come in and complain. I give her hugs, I give her kisses, I take the kids and let her nap or go places, I buy her whatever she wants, I take her on spontaneous dates and nothing comes from it. And I know she gets turned on. She watches porn at least once a week. If I could I would leave in a heart beat at this point. I have tried talking to her about how to me in a relationship intimacy is important but it seems to fall on deaf ears. I have tried the dumb ""couples questions"" card games to figure it out and nothing. I can't get anything from her beyond a kiss. 

I can't leave though. The thought of not being able to see my girls on a daily basis absolutely scares me to death. I can't imagine a way that I would make it only seeing them for half their lives. 

I'm not coming for tips or tricks or suggestions. This is mostly just me trying to complain it out. I'm done trying to be intimate and am probably going to go full roommate on her and maybe then she will notice me. ",3,1756354935.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

The current framework, pending peer review (my best friend over coffee), indicates a correlafion between immediate positive affect surge and observable canine play behavoirs in public park scenarios.

The initial hypothesis suggests that the observed emotional escalation is unintentionally triggered by the rhythmic oscillation patterns exhibited in canine play‚Äîsppecifically, frisbee retrieval, ball chasing, and tail wagging. These patterns initiate an immediate and somewhat inexplicable serotonin surge, approximately equivalent to an internal 'Ding!' sound one mihgt associate with a victorious social media notification.

The system of analysis deployed involves a muti-sensory data collection. Observations made from a shaded bench include: 1) auditory reflections‚Äîplayful bagks, 2) visual stimuli‚Äîvolatile movements of tais, 3) kinesthetic empathy‚Äîpotential mirror neuron activation as arms twitch excitedly, and 4) olfactory considerations‚Äîfresh grass and fur mixture in the air.

Each dimension is rafed on a self-devised Likert scale ranging from 1 (mildly intrigued) to 5 (overt hilairty) based on its capacity to influence the emotional oucome.
