1g4jtgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pen_Swap/comments/1g4jtgt/wts_brand_new_chinese_starter_fountain_pens/,[WTS] Brand new Chinese starter fountain pens,"Hi all, when I started getting into fountain pens last year, I went a little crazy because of the super cheap prices of Chinese FPs and bought a LOT of pens. Inevitably some of them ended up going unused and have been sitting around. I‚Äôm currently trying to cull my collection and thus trying to send these to homes where they will be used and appreciated. All pens have been stored safely in a pen case until now and so are in A1 condition. None of these pens have been used or even dipped. All pens come with converters, and I can include some ink cartridges at no extra cost.

Conus shipping will be $7 and I‚Äôm more than happy to combine multiple pens for offers. Pens are numbered from top-down.

Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/G24MFqm](https://imgur.com/a/G24MFqm)

I haven‚Äôt taken many pics because there were quite a few pens but I‚Äôm happy to send more upon request. Jinhao pens have had their residual ink from the factory dip-testing cleaned out.

1. New-in-box Majohn A1 in Matte-Black with Clip: This is the first real clone of the Pilot VP that the Chinese market saw, and is still well-loved among FP folks. Comes with the Majohn converter and two Pilot-compatible cartridges that it initially came with. Asking $15.
2. Hongdian Black Forest EF: Next up is the famous Hongdian Black Forest with Hongdian's excellent #5 EF nib. This pen came highly recommended by r/fountainpens but unfortunately ended up being a little too thin for my sausage fingers. Asking $12
3. Jinhao 35 Morandi Red/Pink<EF>: This is an excellent and very pretty pen for someone looking for a metal-bodied pen to abuse. Comes with Jinhao's very underrated Lamy clone nib in EF. Asking $3.
4. Jinhao x159 in Wine Red with Chrome trim <Fine>: Next up is Jinhao's amazing x159 with a Fine nib. I have three x159's already and each of them works remarkably. The x159 is my favorite cheap pen and I love the #8 nib, but I have a lot of burgundy colored pens already and so this pen never saw any use. Asking $5.
5. Jinhao 997 <Fine>: The 997 is a very underrated glossy black-and-gold pen, that is excellently balanced in the hand. Visually it's inspired by (although not exactly looking like) the Parker IM. The original pen came with an absolute stinker of a chrome-trim nib (the only Jinhao nib that has ever let me down) and so I replaced it with a very smooth brand-new Wing Sung two-tone gold-trim Fine nib that wrote much better but also matched the black and gold aesthetic of the pen. I can also replace it with a Majohn gold-trim nib for $2 extra. Asking $3.
6. Jinhao 950 ""Porcelain Bamboo Shoots"" <Fine>: Next up we have the absolutely beautiful Jinhao 950 in ""Porcelain Bamboo Shoots"". This is one of three pens in the 950 Porcelain range, inspired by ancient Chinese pottery. It's a little on the heavier side without being too heavy to use, and comes with Jinhao's excellent #5 Fine nib. Asking $5.
7. Jinhao x350 <Fine>: Next up is Jinhao's absolutely excellent x350. The slightly slimmer older brother of the x850, this pen is designed for long writing sessions while looking excellent in your hands. The pen is excellently balanced, and I can vouch for that myself given that an x350 was one of my daily drivers for a while. However, I'd originally bought two, but ended up using only one, and so the other one will go. Asking $7.
8. Jinhao 9019 Dadao Transparent Green <choose your nib size>: When this colorway of 9019 was released, I might have gone a little crazy and bought 5. However, I only kept two, and decided to sell off the other three. Given that I have a large number of Jinhao #8 nib units, these pens can come in your choice of nib width, from EF to F to M, just let me know which you want. Extra nib units can also be sold with your pen at $3 a piece. Asking $8 per pen, currently 3 available.
9. Jinhao 82 Coffee and Cream set <F>: The camera has not captured how pretty these pens are, and the brown sections are translucent and very glittery. I bought these 82's to see if I'd ever be interested in a Sailor PGS, but unfortunately these are wayyyyy too small for my hands, and so I'm selling them off. Ideally prefer to sell as a set for $12 but can sell each individually for $7.",2,1729030039.0,Pen_Swap,1,1.0,False

It was me and three other guys and the rest of the group was eleven girls. On the trip I got very close with everyone in this group. I especially got interested in this one girl. I hadn‚Äôt really talked to her except a little before the trip. Over the course of the trip I found myself getting more and more infatuated with her. But this infatuation felt very different than crushes I had in high school. It wasn‚Äôt anything lustful, it was more about her personality and some of her flaws I found most attractive. She was easy to make laugh, which was surprising to me because I‚Äôve never seen myself as a witty/funny guy. During the trip I‚Äôd always try my best to sit near her in lectures, buses, etc. Not next to her but maybe within eye sight. I mentioned to one of the guys I knew before the trip I might ask her to coffee after this trip is done with. He said that‚Äôd be a great idea and that I should shoot my shot. 

The last night of the trip while a group of us including her were having dinner, she mentioned her boyfriend. It came up in casual conversation and my friend sitting across from me could see my shock. This has led me down a very confusing rabbit hole. 

One on hand it‚Äôs motivated me to work on myself physically, academically, hobbies/interests. But on the other hand I just wanna go to her and tell her I‚Äôm interested, regardless of the answer. Because at least then I‚Äôd have some closure. I‚Äôve asked multiple people what to do. I‚Äôve had some friends who say move on. I‚Äôve had one who said if you really like her keep pursuing her (respectfully of course). He made the point that boyfriends come and go and she might just need to know I‚Äôm interested in her. 

It‚Äôs been a two days since I got back from this trip and I can‚Äôt get her out of my head. I value her company a lot but I‚Äôm not sure I could keep her as only a friend. She encouraged me to join a club she‚Äôs in so I figured I might do that to try and build a friendship. But right now my course of action is to give it a couple months of friendship and if I‚Äôm still uncomfortable I‚Äôll just shoot my shot and go for it. Really I‚Äôm writing in this subreddit because I want to know, 1. Is this just a crush that will blow over in a month or is it something more. And 2. What should I do and has anyone been in a similar situation. Sorry for the long paragraph I‚Äôve been a big mess. ",1,1729029590.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

# Background

This was my second marathon. I finished the 2023 Chicago Marathon at 3:06:xx on minimal training. In the 3 months leading up to last year's race, I averaged 22 miles a week with a peak of 40 miles. Basically, one ‚Äúlong‚Äù run a week with a few easy days sprinkled in. ¬†I crashed at mile 19 and ran-walk the last 7 miles. A few weeks after Chicago, I ran the Hot Chocolate 5k at 17:59, which I expect would have been 15-30 seconds faster if it wasn‚Äôt for a shitshow of a start.

I‚Äôm 34 M. I was a good middle-distance runner in high school, which was 16+ years ago. PBs were: \~16:30 in 5k, 4:30 in the mile, and 1:56 in the 800.¬†



# Training

Based on last year‚Äôs finish, I knew with adequate mileage and weekly consistency a sub 3 was attainable. But given my hectic work travel, I didn‚Äôt commit to a structured plan.

¬†You can say I had a concept of a plan with the intention to:  
¬†¬†

* Improve zone 2 pacing
* Incorporate MP into long runs
* Run a weekly VO2 max/repeats style workout
* Peak at 55 miles/week

From mid-June to the end of September, I averaged 32 miles per week peaking at 44.

Still very light and I failed to hit my mileage and VO2 max workouts consistency targets, but it was better and much more intentional than my 2023 training block.

A few flagship workouts included: 20 miles with 12 at MP, 18 miles progression with last 5 at MP, 10 x 1k at 3:30 km pace, and Norwegian 4x4 at sub 5:20 mi/pace. I felt soreness and tenderness on my Posterior Tibial Tendon on my last couple long runs. So, I had a two-week taper where I only ran a total of 15 miles with lots of PTT exercises.

¬†All in all, I saw remarkable improvements in my running performance and fitness levels compared to the previous year. I ended my training block very confidently and believed I would break the 3-hour mark.

¬†

# ¬†Pre-race

On Monday of race week, I started eating more carbs than normal. Bagel and juice for breakfast, a bigger serving of rice with dinner, etc. Friday, 2 days before the marathon, I started counting carbs to eat 750 g per day. Multiple bagels, pop-tarts, juice, rice, sliced bread. Honestly, it was disgusting. But I did it.¬†

Walked over to the expo Friday after work. I live a few blocks away. Saturday did a 3-mile shake-out run to a local bagel shop. And continued to gorge on carbs from my couch. Picked up a Chipotle burrito bowl for dinner and was in bed before 8:30.

Woke up at 4, showered, cut my toenails, ate a bagel with honey, and washed it down with pomegranate juice, coffee, and a liquid iv. Took care of other businesses, and at 6, my wife dropped me off at Mount Roosevelt and Indiana.

Went to the bathroom again. Checked my gear and was in Corral B by 7 am.

7:20, I needed to pee again, which obviously wasn‚Äôt going to happen‚Ä¶



# Race

Given last year‚Äôs crash and burn, I wanted to go out slower and more controlled. Aimed for a 6:45 pace for the first couple of miles before setting down. First three miles, I manually lapped: 6:33, 6:39, and 6:43 ‚Äì a little fast but was happy that I dialed it back after the first mile.

Was feeling very great. Picked up the pace and settled in the low 6:30s. Took a GU gel every 20 minutes, which was basically every 5k. Sprinkled in a few salt tabs and fruit chews on the 30-minute marks.

Saw my wife and parents at miles 7.5 and 8.5 ‚Äì what a great boost. ¬†

¬†The urge to pee never faded, and I pulled off around mile 9 in Lakeview for a quick, 45-second piss break.

¬†Crossed back through the downtown halfway at 1:26:xx ¬†and was feeling quite strong. Though, I started to feel a little ache in my left ankle on my PTT. That had me a bit concerned. But I kept pushing, maintaining that 6:30ish pace.

¬†Miles 16 and 17 coming back through Chicago‚Äôs west loop, the sun poked out, and it felt hot for the first time all day. But was pleasantly surprised with the crowd support as last year that stretch was bare.

¬†Ran into more friends turning into Little Italy at mile 17.5ish ‚Äì another nice boost. This is where the wheels started falling off last year. Sia‚Äôs Unstoppable was next on my shuffle, and it was the perfect song for that moment. Singing in my head (and even out loud)‚Ä¶

>*‚ÄúI'm invincible‚Ä¶* *I'm so powerful‚Ä¶* *I'm so confident... I'm unstoppable today‚Äù*¬†

Made it to Pilsen, which is a fun, energizing riot. I was in the zone. Starting passing people. Completely missed lapping mile 19. Was running high 6:20s. Feeling very strong.

Chinatown. Bronzeville. South Loop (which is where live). Finish line. There‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel. Less than 10k away.

I saw my family again in Chinatown. Now just down and back. But for me, southbound Michigan Ave is the worst section of the race. Being so close, yet so far. Seeing runners headed to the final stretch and passing mile 24, when you haven‚Äôt crossed mile 23 is discouraging. Aside from my bio break, mile 23 was my slowest split at 7:05.

At this point, I‚Äôm doing mental math. 2.2 miles to go. 7 min miles, and I‚Äôll break 2:55. Full send. ¬†Mile 24 was my fastest split at 6:22. Saw my family for the last time at mile 25. Final push on the streets that I run, walk, and drive on every day. ¬†Gave it everything I could and crossed the finish line with an official chip time of 2:53:09. 

I was ecstatic. Almost a 14-minute PR. A technical negative split (thanks to the bathroom break), and a hopeful BQ for 2026.

# Post-race & what‚Äôs next

Endorphins and dopamine were running high, finisher beer was flowing, and I felt really, really good. Grabbed my gear, changed my clothes, and met the family at one of my favorite neighborhood spots for a burger and bloody mary. Headed back home, and took a nap, before going out to protein load at Green Street Meats.

I‚Äôll certainly run Chicago again in 2025. I‚Äôll apply for NYC in 2025, but I know that‚Äôs unlikely. And I‚Äôll be crossing my fingers that a 6:51 minute buffer will be enough for Boston 2026. Setting my next goal at sub 2:45:00. And will consider getting a coach for my next attempt. ",2,1729029355.0,AdvancedRunning,0,1.0,False

1g4jekj,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1g4jekj/stanly_ranch_review/,Stanly Ranch Review,"A quick review of Stanly Ranch, the Auberge property in Napa. We've been to other Auberge's and this one has some work to do. 

**Where we went**:¬†*San Francisco then Napa*

**When we went**:¬†*Early October, six nights at Stanly Ranch*

**Who went**: *Husband+ Self for an Anniversary Trip*

**Pictures of the property**:¬†*I didn't take any, so sorry.* 

**Service**:¬†*10/10*

* One of two highlights of the property. Everyone was delightful to work with. From check in to check out, people were pleasant, professional, and easy. They have a great staff. A highlight was Citalli Alves who called us before we arrived, followed up by email before we came, and everything she set up was flawless. She helped with wine tasting reservations, hot air ballooning, and helped us find a car service. She had a full itinerary printed out and waiting at check in and followed up while we were there. We mentioned at some point that it was our wedding anniversary while planning and there was a lovely charcuterie spread with a bottle of Chardonnay in our room when we got there. 

**Property**:¬†6*/10*

* The property will likely improve in time, but right now, it's just too new to be a 10/10. The landscaping needs to grow in a lot. The location will likely not improve. It's pretty far down the valley. I'll stay somewhere more central next time. 
* The #1 thing to know is that there's construction right now.  They're building the residences section of the resort and doing audible work. It wasn't a huge deal for us as we were out and about from about all day each day and it seems to stop by 6, but if you're picturing serenity on your patio all day, it might be an issue for you. I think it will get worse for quite a while before it gets better because they're just laying the road now. If you go, ask for a room near the spa which on the opposite side from the construction.  
* There are two pool areas, the main pool and the spa pool. Neither were crowded, but we were there mostly during the week. On Friday, the place was noticeably more busy. I can see weekends getting hectic as my guess is there's a large wedding crowd. Pool temp was good, but it's shallow -- maybe 4 feet max? My husband is very tall and it was just above waist deep on him. Hot tubs were lovely and a perfect temp. 
* The spa and gym are another highlight. I loved Halehouse and the yoga instructor at the Fieldhouse gym was fantastic. The yoga shala looks over the vineyards and the infinity sculpture. It's sun drenched and just a delightful place to practice. They have all new Manduka equipment. 
* There are lots of lovely firepits scattered around the core area of the property. They're a great place to grab a drink. 
* Re: Parking. Self parking was closed all week. The lot is like 15-20 feet from the entrance. There's no reason to valet and it's frankly less luxe because now you have to wait for someone to bring the car vs. just walking the 15 feet to your car. Not a fan of this and it makes no sense because as soon as you get out, you're walking at least 5 minutes to your room. 
* Gift shop -- the only items for sale in the gift shop are in sizes small or medium for both women and men. FYI, the in-room robes, which you are encouraged to wear to the pool, etc and slippers are also very very small. No one likes a small robe. My size 10 feet hang off the slippers. My husband's size 13 feet don't even fit in the front part. Not great. 

**Rooms**:¬†*scale of 6/10*

* We were in a Rambler King, which was more than enough from a size perspective. We booked late, so it was the choice that was available. The mattress is great and the linens are top quality. It had a patio with a very comfy two person chaise lounge, a table for eating dinner, etc. and a great fire pit. The patio for our unit backed up to the vineyards on the edge of the property and has a lot of native landscaping, so we've seen a ton of fauna-- butterflies, hummingbirds, jackrabbits, etc, which has been delightful. I'm definitely glad we were on the edge of the property vs. in the center as those patios seem less shady and less private. The room has a big L shaped couch, too. There was a connecting door. 
* The bathroom has two showers (one indoor/one outdoor) and a separate water closet. The toiletries smell herbal and fresh. The outdoor shower has been great during this week's heat wave. Private, hot water, good water pressure, three shower heads (angled, handheld, foot specific) etc. The indoor shower less so. It only has that horrible rain shower type head that hangs straight down from the ceiling. There is a handheld showerhead, but you can't position it to actually spray on your back. The rain shower head always gets in your eyes and does not have enough pressure to get conditioner out. The bathroom could also use a few more hooks for robes, toiletry bags, etc.
* The biggest negative about the room is that there is no dresser. Why. . . There's literally only two tiny drawers in the closet and 8 hangers. There aren't even drawers in the nightstands. I don't understand how you're supposed to unpack. I hate living out of my luggage and there was no other good option here. There's also no iron or ironing board, just a steamer.  
* The AC is a mini split. It struggled to keep up with last week's heat wave. I like to sleep cold (65-66) and it never got below 74 until after the heat wave.

* So, there was so much native fauna (that one decided to join us in our room. We did have a mouse our last night. The hotel was apologetic. 
* FYI, none of our room problems were about size or category. I wouldn't bother booking a larger room. I'd just go elsewhere. 
* I think they were around $1600/night, but they have a ton of deals like 3rd night free or 30% off longer stays right now. 

**Food**:¬†*7/10*

* Bear, the main restaurant, is just ok. It's not going to shock and awe you, but the meal and service were competent. Breakfast there was ok-- eggs were overcooked and the toast that comes with them is literally one piece, but the bacon was amazing. They also run in room dining. We had it twice. Both times were fast and solid, but inconsistent. For example, one time the flank steak had sauce, the next time it didn't. The thing is, Napa has sooo many good places to eat. Unless you're coming in late (or find yourself post-wine hungry!) like we were, there are absolutely better options. 
* The minibar in the room is fantastic. They have a Nespresso complimentary with your choice of pods and the minibar has fresh real milk for your coffee every day. YES. All the non-alcoholic items are complementary and critically it's well stocked with plates, utensils, a wine key, glasses, for a little patio picnic if you bring provisions back from your day in Napa. 
* The pool bar was also just ok -- the menu looked good, drinks were good, but when we went to order, they were out of the food items we wanted. 
* The pastries at the coffee shop are EXCELLENT. 10/10 for their patisserie. Do not sleep on the ham and cheese croissant, cinnamon roll or the lavender bun.

**Extras & activities**:¬†*10/10* 

* Look, Napa's a 10/10 as a destination. So, highlights for us included Singlethread in Healdsburg (12/10, must go and allow the som to do the wine pairings for you!), hiking in the Marin Headlands and the Muir Woods (bring a picnic from Mill Valley Market), wine tastings at Quintessa, Heitz, Stags Leap Wine Cellars, Cakebread, Schramsburg, etc. and the amazing Oakville Grocery, where you can very dangerously go by the glass on everything from Screaming Eagle to a $30 Syrah. We also enjoyed a road trip day to a spa in Freestone and lunch in Bodega Bay. Napa Valley Balloons was also a great morning if you are ok with the 5:30 wakeup call. The ride down the valley was gorgeous. We did have a rental car but used the car service if we knew the wine was going to be flowing heavily. 
* The hotel does have some kind of program where you can borrow a Ferrari or a Mercedes for the afternoon. it's not something that matters to us, so we didn't, but it might be fun to others. ",2,1729028908.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

# Training

This past May I retired on a Tuesday and by Wednesday 3 AM I had my marathon plan in place. All in my head. Not a great night of sleep. I was just too damn excited. Now I had to just ‚Äúdo it‚Äù. It felt crazy but somewhat typical of how I operate. I asked my son, who‚Äôs in his early 20s and just completed his first marathon in April if he wanted to do a marathon with me. He was onboard in an instant.

**Coaching:** After loads of research, I chose Runna to coach me. It was fantastic. I cannot say enough positive things about my experience using Runna‚Äîbut that‚Äôs a post for another day. My training block was 22 weeks. It was far too long in hindsight. Eighteen weeks would have been better. I also consulted Pfitz and Ben Parkes for reality checks and my son of course. My plan consisted of 5 weekly runs and maxed out at about 49 miles. Mileage was consistently in the upper-30s and mid-40s mpw. It felt doable for someone without a job. The cadence was three weeks of solid running followed by a de-load week to recover. On average each week included a tempo session and a threshold interval session. I embraced the ‚Äúmake the hard days hard‚Äú mindset.  I only missed two training sessions in the entire plan making for a total of 741 miles of training. I was initially doing weight training but gave up doing that after a few weeks, it was too much for me.

**Past Experience:** I started running in middle school when it was the craze in the late '70s. I read Jim Fixx‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Complete Book of Running‚Äù as a kid. I ran some 5Ks and 10Ks, then I ran two years in high school but gave it up to play football when I became a junior. As an adult I‚Äôve stayed active, never really putting on weight and doing my best to keep moving. I did crossfit for a few years but when my gym closed during COVID I started running and lifting at home. I‚Äôm not the kind of person you‚Äôd look at and say, ‚ÄúThat guy lifts‚Äù.

**Following the plan**: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù tall. During my training block, I went from 178 lbs to 163 lbs and lost an inch in the waist. Over the last four years, I had been running about 2-3 days per week year-round with weekly mileage clocking in at 12-15 mpw. Easing into the training plan felt like I was ramping up but manageable.

**The Course**: The Mohawk Hudson River Marathon is a point-to-point race that ends in Albany. It‚Äôs a smaller race with a little over 500 competitors. Much of the course is on a rail-trail bike path but has about 4 miles of roads that wind through city streets. It‚Äôs a well-run race and loved by many locals. The race is popular in circles for its ease of use and good chances of capturing a BQ. The race profile is largely descending with a few manageable hills. For the most part, it feels ‚Äúflat‚Äù. If anything the few 100-meter descents were ‚Äúunwelcomed‚Äù and I was eager to get them over with.  The vibe at this race is great. It's an impeccable run event. Being smallish, it was perfect for a first-timer like me.

# Pre-Race

**Day before:** I picked up my race packet and checked into my hotel about a mile from the start in Schenectady. I carbo-loaded 3 days ahead. The day before the race I had a Maurtens drink mix 320 drink in the late afternoon just because I had the packet and figured I should use it. It‚Äôs a clear sweetish goopy drink. Not pleasant but doable. That evening we had a great dinner (pasta of course) at an Italian restaurant near the hotel. I slept awful as to be expected for a first-timer. After a bagel with honey, a banana, and a small yogurt with oats at 5:30 AM. I had a terrible coffee cup of coffee. Bathroom success was achieved.

**Day of:** Morning temperatures were in the mid-40s (7 ¬∞C). Rain started coming down at about 6 AM leaving me overly worried about my clothing choices. Luckily I had a plastic rain poncho during the warm-up. My wife and son collected my extra clothing before the race. Lines were too long at the porta-potties for an extra ‚Äústop‚Äù before the start. I was in pretty good shape in that department, so it was just an extra precaution. The rain started to let up around gun time. I wore arm warmers, a short-sleeved shirt, shorts, a ballcap, and gloves. I kept them for the entire race. I am a heavy sweater. The kit was perfect. I ran in Saucony Endorphin Pro 3s.

# Race

**Pacing:** I researched the available pace groups and learned the quickest available pacer was a 3:25 group; a force named Jamie. Perfect for my target marathon pace. I‚Äôd seen that he‚Äôd completed the race many times before and his past splits were remarkable. I planned to sit in with his group for as long as possible. And that was it. I stuck to him like glue. Nothing was going to shake me off him.   I fuelled with mostly gels, taking one gel every 4 miles.

**Fueling:** I carried 2 GU Rocktanes (high sodium), 4 Maurten Gel 100s, and 2 Maurten Gel Caf 100s. I had one gel 10 minutes before the start and one extra just in case. Water stations were supposedly every two miles but I‚Äôm not sure it was that frequent. I alternated between water and Gatorade throughout the race. I never skipped a station.

**How it went:** Our group started with about 3 dozen runners and at mile 26 all that remained were four of us‚Äîtwo of those being my son and me. I considered over the days leading up to the race if I could be lucky enough to ‚Äúdrop the hammer‚Äù and pick up that pace leaving the pace group at some point. I thought maybe I‚Äôd ‚Äúgo‚Äù with 10K to go but I knew at mile 18 I was in a ‚Äúhanging on for dear life‚Äù mode. At this point, my legs were getting very fatigued. My feet and ankles starting to feel some pain. With 5K to go the legs and calves were starting to tighten and became a big distraction. I was in uncharted territory. I desperately did not want to ‚Äúlock up‚Äù. My son asked, ‚ÄúWhat do you think? Should we go?‚Äù. I took stock and again knew I had nothing more in the tank. ‚ÄúGonna hang with Jamie‚Äù is all I could get out. For the final 0.2 miles, Jamie told us to move out‚Äîwe had banked about 40 seconds and he was going to start slowing down, so my boy and I upped our pace and dashed into the finish. I had nothing left. My wife and oldest son met us at the finish area. I had no idea I would be so lucky to achieve what I set out to do five months earlier. I was too tired to cry yet unbelievably happy with the day. It was something I‚Äôll never forget.

# Post Race

Seems at 58 years old I have a chance to qualify for Boston in ‚Äò26. I will apply and hope for the best. I‚Äôve entered the Berlin ‚Äò25 lottery‚Äîif I get in, I‚Äôll do it, otherwise I‚Äôll head to Chicago next October. I know, it‚Äôs nuts but what the hell, a man needs a hobby. In the meantime, I‚Äôm on the waitlist for Seville. I‚Äôm not expecting to get in, but seems being in Spain in May would be pretty sweet. In the meantime, I‚Äôm heading into maintenance mode.

Finally, I owe a ton of gratitude to the ‚ÄúAdvanced Running‚Äù subreddit. I‚Äôve gathered a lot of great information from the generous advice of this community. Thank you so much for helping me snatch a much-needed victory.

I also agree that what is going on in Gaza is a genocide and Israel is monstrous and should be 'corrected' in whatever way that needs to manifest.

I do have a confession, however: I find it very hard, as a woman and a leftist, to find a path through the impossible needle of coexisting with someone who wants me either dead or chained to an oven. It feels very 'paradox of tolerance'. I believe in secular personal freedom with no input from the government on how one leads their life, except to prevent one from harming someone else. Islam is, at its core, an authoritarian, patriarchal, totalitarian system that oppresses women, other ideologies, and basically anyone who isn't them. **I do not believe this means genocide them.** I just can't think of how to reconcile these diametrically opposed ideas. It feels doomed to conflict.

Now, the saying goes, 'not all X'. And that's true. Someone can simply choose not to abide the more hateful parts of the book, if they decide. But I can't understand why we are comfortable with that exception. We don't make that sort of exception for any other ideology. If you walked into someone's house and there was a copy of Mein Kampf on the coffee table, and you started asking questions about why its there, you'd want answers. If those answers are ""Oh, we don't believe in the death camps stuff, we just like the idea of an empowered state not mired in red tape and bureaucracy that can quickly take action to support its people"", then sure, you can debate that, and even call it nuts, but it *is* a stance someone could have that one could feasibly understand someone coming to.

But the fact remains Mein Kampf says 'Jews are vermin and we have to kill them all'. It just says that, right in there. And I don't think any book that has that in it should hold a place of veneration, nor do I think the people that invest themselves in any part of an ideology where that is mandated and codified, even if they choose not to obey it, should receive any slack. But its frustrating that all we have to do is use the word 'religion' and suddenly even the most abhorrent shit gets a pass, or at the very most, an apathetic 'what can you do'.

I don't think this means they should be genocided, but the sticking point for me is I can't seem to think of a way to reconcile coexistence with an ideology that abhors coexistence. I just don't know what the actual solution is. Eventually the planet is going to reach a point of interconnectedness that contact between Islam and non-Islam is going to be unavoidable. I know the answer isn't ""kill them all"", but what *is* it? Just ignore it? Well, we tried that with Nazism, and we got Trump. Ban the practice? That feels very 'limitation of free speech'-y, we don't even do that to actual Nazis and Klanners (Whether or not we *should* is, I suppose, the topic).

1g4j38h,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1g4j38h/mil_literally_hates_me/,MIL literally hates me...,"My mother in law seems to hate me, she seems to be mad that I have helped her son turn in a man. My mother in law used to love me, we would always have day dates going to lunch, get nails done, and simply go shopping. Fast forward to today she constantly has something to say about me rather about my mental health, my weight gain, or my house since I just don't do enough. I work 40 hours a week myself same as my husband and us splitting the household work just works for us, we take everything and split it down the middle. She seems to think that this is unacceptable and my husband has told her multiple times that if she doesn't like our dynamic then she doesn't have to come around, he tells her that I am his wife and that I will not be going anywhere and she can get over it. This all started when I moved out of her house and took everything that I bought with me from food to household essentials, and she called the cops to try and get me arrested. I just showed the cops all my receipts from buying the items and they agreed that everything that I was packing was in fact mine and not hers. She told the whole family that I am thief and has turned all of them against me and to this day keeps it going with everyone, mind you this incident was almost 3 years ago. When we announced our engagement his grandma texted him and told him that he would loose his family if he actually married me because I was the biggest mistake of his life and we wouldn't last. They cannot stand that we have been together right at 4 years and married 2 of them, and we're thriving. We bought a house and hour away from them (his choice we looked in their town but decided this was best for us). 

  
Mind you my MIL has been sleeping with a married man for 5 years or more, the mans wife has cancer and she hasn't stopped. They sneak away to dinner and beach trips and he keeps telling her that he will leave his wife because he loves her... I don't agree with this and I have always been very clear on that, the man threatened my life when I left saying if  I told anyone about them then he would have me murdered. All because I moved out of her house and took my stuff, she turned on my husband immediately causing him to go get his stuff and move out too. He took her name off of his bank account so she would stop taking all of his money, he would make 550 a week and she'd take every dime except may 50 bucks then jump his case for spending that on gas for work, keep in mind she done this every week so every month she took 2 grand from him since he turned 18.  The bills in the house ended up being like 200 each after splitting them 3 ways, so there was no reason for her to be taking that much money, come to find out later she was giving all of this money to his brother that wouldn't work to pay his bills. 

When he was getting his stuff she game him a right hook to his jaw and wouldn't let him have anything but a coffee table full of his stuff, she threw away all of his clothes that she wouldn't let him have and moved his brother in with his girlfriend  WHO SHE DONE THE SAME THING TO A YEAR LATER. After all of this happened my husband decided to go no contact and recently let her back into our lives. It was going great but now suddenly it's went back all to hell leading me to believe my MIL hates me.

The icing on this cake was when my mother passed way from suddenly and in a traumatic way, on my way to my moms funeral she called me and asked what  I was doing, I said I am on my way to my mom funeral she got mad and said you didn't call me to tell the arrangements so I'm not gonna be there. I can't miss work with no notice, live woman what? I didn't tell anyone the arrangements, I shared them on my facebook account and that was that, I wasn't even in the world since I just lost the only parent that gave a fuck about me right in front of my eyes and you're mad at me?  Her dad was at my moms funeral with her brother and he even admitted he told her the date and time, she just didn't want to be there. To this day she still throws this up in my face, even through it's been over 2 years ago. 

 I have always been good to her. I would spend time with her, buy gifts, let her drive my car when hers was out of commission, gave a side job helping me clean houses, clean her house, and help anyway I could financially during my time living under roof. We included her in date night so she wouldn't mad that we didn't take her eat or bowl with us even if we always made sure to bring her back food from any restaurant she wanted. She seems just jealous of our relationship or maybe jealous of me even? I'm not sure. Anyone else have a similar situation? What can I do?  I would like to have relationship with her but it just seems impossible.",6,1729028064.0,JUSTNOMIL,5,1.0,False

I‚Äôve met quite a few nepo-babies or spawn of the wildly wealthy who have gone on to start their own ventures, albeit they may not be making a ton of money (yet). However, despite genuinely taking an interest in them, offering to help in whatever ways I can and not hounding them about their wealth, it always comes back to me as I‚Äôm not good enough for their circle. Despite having equivalent or higher credentials than they do, they always treat me like I have nothing to contribute to their lives. This makes me feel like a worthless human being for one, and two clueless about how to actually build a relationship with people.

Side note: I‚Äôm not against befriending people in my own economic circle but I have a lot of issues because they care about different things. For them, high end luxury brands don‚Äôt matter and they dress like trash, they lack the caring to workout/exercise, and are often strong God worshippers to the point where they attribute everything in their life to praising God and their life centers around worship, or they have little to no motivation or goals in their lives. They‚Äôre also so incredibly needy and their life circumstances have so many challenges that it makes it difficult to want to be around them. 

I‚Äôve tried going to bars, taking classes, asking to join networking groups which don‚Äôt respond to my queries, hanging around in coffee shops, asking to join in on events, creating my own projects and more, but it‚Äôs literally like nothing I do leads to finding friends and having company. Especially company that is positive and optimistic and shares the desire to grow and achieve things. Please help!!!

you could either play as Elisabeth and enjoy a varied retelling of the movie's plot, not unlike The Thing (1980s, Carpenter) and it's PS2 release. OR, even better, you could create 2 characters: the original character - probably older in age - and then later on, the Other Body character. i'd theorize it could be a choice-based story with multiple endings, and the player would have to adhere to the same rules provided in the film for the mechanics of the game. the player could also choose NOT to adhere to the rules of the film (stabilize every day, switch every 7 days, do not reuse the activator, do not forget ""you are one"")... which would be an alternate line of choices that would also affect the ending.

Long story short, I'm a 35yo female and I'm worried my doctor is dismissing a possible pheochromocytoma.¬† I know they are very rare, but it fits my symptoms so well and I'm trying to decide¬†if I need to push for her to investigate this more or if anything else could explain my symptoms.

My saga started 7 years ago when I abruptly and out of the blue started having severe panic attacks. I had no previous history of anxiety or panic whatsoever and had spent years traveling and had a career that I loved as an architect. I began having dizzy/lightheaded spells where I just felt weak and had to sit down at job sites when I'd been standing for more than a few minutes. At the time I was 5'-11"" 195lbs, so a little overweight but generally perfectly healthy. I don't smoke, rarely drink, and don't use recreational drugs. Not long after these dizzy/weak spells started, the full blown panic attacks began and nothing has been the same since.¬†At the time (before weight gain) I was having blood pressure spikes as much as 175/100, now I'm having nearly daily episodes of hypertensive crisis (180/100 - 205/105 on average).

At the time, my doctor checked my metenephrines¬†with a 24hr urine test and they were elevated, but after a subsequent appointment with endocrinology, they came back at the high end of normal so¬†they stopped looking for¬†answers and sent me to a psychiatrist. I also did a brain MRI and echocardiogram at the time, both of which came back normal. Cortisol was also normal (18). My PCP has dismissed everything as anxiety/weight (even though neither were a factor when the dizzyness¬†first began), but my psychiatrist (an MD I've seen for years) has always wondered if there was an underlying physical cause because the way everything began was so unusual.¬†

  
My full list of symptoms:

* Sudden onset of panic attacks with no history
* Rapid weight loss (15 pounds in two weeks), then rapid weight gain (70 pounds in 2 years), though this could be due to taking sertraline.¬†
* Deficient vitamin D - I took prescription¬†vitamin D at the time this all started and recently had to start again
* Deficient¬†potassium - 2.7 at the worst
* Wildly uncontrolled blood pressure despite taking 250mg labetalol 2x/day, 100mg losartan, 20meq potassium (worst systolic was 202, worst diastolic was 118 and I routinely hit 180s/100s) - BP cuff was cross-checked w/ doctor's office
* Still get very easily lightheaded or dizzy with the slightest physical exertion
* Get sweaty & have significant temperature fluctuations when doing little things like unloading the dishwasher
* Occasional night-sweats, but not all the time
* Consistently high bilirubin¬†levels (1.7-2.1)
* Flushing
* Swollen face before gaining weight
* Sometimes shaky hands (noticed when holding phone or coffee cup)
* Nearly constant feeling like a rubber band is squeezing my head
* Frequently have upper neck/base of skull ache/pain
* Occasional severe pain behind shoulder blades
* I bruise easily (my 6mo niece left little toe shaped bruises on my legs when I bounced her)
* Consistently low transferrin¬†saturation (12-13%)
* Fatigue - I wake up feeling like I barely slept. Coffee doesn't help.
* Brain fog - can't focus to save my life and have the memory of a goldfish. Neither used to be the case.
* Been waking up in the middle of the night feeling weird (for lack of a better word) - lightheaded, tension headache, extremely high BP of around 200/100
* Had one incident at the beginning¬†where I woke up overheated and thirsty and fainted in the middle of the night. At the time I had just started a half dose of lexapro and attributed it to that, but I'm not sure that was the cause.¬†
* Attacks that feel like gallbladder attacks w/ a confirmed gallstone (via ultrasound) - central pain just below rib cage that eases slightly if I press on it. Over the counter pain meds didn't put a dent in the pain and at the worst I was also nauseous and sweaty
* Discovered >50% stenosis of celiac artery during a vascular ultrasound, but all others are normal

As a result of the gallbladder ultrasound they incidentally discovered 2 golf ball sized cysts on my right kidney (one simple, the other bozniak¬†2), one of which was located on the upper pole. It took some convincing, but I talked my doctor into doing an abdominal CT to check out the cyst on the upper pole because of all of my previously listed symptoms and the proximity to the adrenal gland. It showed ""numerous"" cysts on both kidneys including a large one on the upper pole of my right kidney. They've said this could possibly be polycystic kidney disease and didn't mention anything about the adrenal glands being abnormal, but looking at the CT it looks to me like it could be affected.¬†So, I'm wondering, could I be on the right track wondering about pheochromocytoma? Should I drop this? Is there anything else that could make sense of all this? Does the CT look like the adrenal glands could be affected? Really appreciate any help!

Here are CT stills:¬†[https://imgur.com/a/Xfgevta](https://imgur.com/a/Xfgevta)

Normal test results:

* TSH
* Ferritin
* A1C
* Glucose
* all CMP (CO2 lowest end of normal, potassium lowest end of normal while taking 20 meq, chloride highest end of normal)
* all CBC except MCV (low) & MPV (high)
* dexamethasone suppression test",1,1729026877.0,AskDocs,3,0.67,False

+ Breville Barista  
+ Or Bambino Plus

About a month ago my husband went on a business trip and a few coworkers were there as well. One of whom he had befriended (she has only been at the job 7 months). We spent the Fourth of July with her and her fianc√© and had blames to go on another double date. On the trip, they were drinking together and ended up back in her hotel room‚Ä¶ making out. They both agreed to lie to their SO and that it was a mistake. 

Well he comes home and I could tell something was off, so I asked him and he denied anything. I felt like a piece of shit for question him. I had been drinking while he‚Äôs out of town and that is something we had agreed I wouldn‚Äôt do, so I felt like an asshole. As I am beating myself up about it he comes clean and tells me that they made out. I was livid, but we‚Äôve been together for 14 years so I didn‚Äôt make him leave and figured we could work through it. He guarantees me there are no feelings for her and it was just a drunken mistake. 

The whole weekend he tells me how worried about her she is. Her SO is apparently a bit emotionally abusive and they are friends so he wants to make sure she‚Äôs okay. He isn‚Äôt comforting me, but stressing for her. I‚Äôm actually helping him finds ways to talk to her and comforting him. He tells me she is the first friend he has made in his adult life outside of our relationship and he doesn‚Äôt want to loose her. I don‚Äôt want to make him loose that either. 

I start thinking hard about our past year and kind of get that we were drifting. We don‚Äôt have sex that often and I tried to spice it up this year- mostly unreciprocated. I also started planning dates once a month, but when my work got crazy busy it just died. I told him I felt like we were just roommates and that is not what I want in a relationship. 

A few days later I looked at his messages with her and they are sending each other hurts. He also is telling me all about her fianc√© being a jerk to her and I was like, bro I think this is crossing a line. You shouldn‚Äôt be talking to her about her relationships or about ours or sending her hearts. Like come on? I said I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with the type of communication and he asks me if I want him to be happy. 

He is all apologies, saying he will not cross any lines and that he doesn‚Äôt want to fight, can‚Äôt we be normal? So I try and just feel like he is being distant. Like we are just living our normal lives, pretty separate from each other even though this kind of life altering event happened and I express this to him. I cry to him about it and he just says he is really self conscious about hurting me and thinks I deserve better.

A few days later we are on the couch and he gets a text from her at 8pm and I am like WTF? Why are you texting her in the evening when you are home with me? It wasn‚Äôt a sext or anything. It was just about our plants, but then I look at his messages and he‚Äôs been messages her A LOT. Like asking question about her music taste and childhood. Sending pics of our cats. She was out of town for a week and they were still talking the whole time. They were joking about being fun and drunk in Vegas together. 

He continues to say that it is just a platonic friendship. I tell him that talking to her makes me uncomfortable and I can‚Äôt handle it. He then says he thinks that maybe we should take a break because he doesn‚Äôt appreciate me and maybe he will if I‚Äôm not around. WTF?

The next day we had a super intense talk in the morning before work. I told him he needed to choose. I gave him my rings. I was like I can‚Äôt do this. He had an appointment with a therapist for the first time to help his anxiety and came home from it and said he had to tell me something. 

He told me he had been lying. He did have feelings and she did too. They admitted it to each other in Vegas and he had been trying to make them go away since. Had he? He had been talking to her intimately about us and his feelings, hugging her as I found out, and even going out to coffee with her. Most of which I have found out since.

I freaked out, Packed my bags, went to my parents, was devastated. I drank. I shouldn‚Äôt have and made it worse. I texted her and she ended up telling her SO and I‚Äôm pretty sure they are done.

At this point it‚Äôs been a few weeks and more us come out, he is still worried about her. He reached out and she told him to leave her alone. I‚Äôm still here and wondering if I‚Äôm just being an idiot. Like am I the asshole here? ",1,1729026682.0,Infidelity,8,0.67,False

Please help me out fellow girls,"(I wasn't sure about the flair, I'm sorry if it's wrong, and I know there is a separate thread for Family & Relationships, but it was related to my main problem of needing help to study which is why I added. I'm really sorry if I did it wrong, pls do not ban me, I really need help.)

So, I have an extremely important entrance exam coming up, I really need to clear it. It's like a life and death matter for me. Honestly I'd rather prefer to die if, God forbid, I don't clear it. Clearing it is my only way out of this abusive home filled with assholes.

I share a room with my abusive mother and younger sis. Me and my sis study in the same room at our separate desks, while my mother just spends her time sitting/lying on the bed using it to read eroticas, smut, playing sudoku, watching movies and dramas or watching news.

**Problem No 1**- that I'm hyper sensitive to distractions and easily get distracted, and this fucking bitch just can't use earphones (I dOn'T LikE uSInG ThEm) or lower the volume and keeps watching dramas/news where people yell/scream/shout and what not and it drives me crazy! I'm. Unable. To. Study.

I have tried everything. The only thing that works, temporarily is begging/requesting her (amma, achchi amma, awaaz kam kar lo na yaar, jaldi se please) So she would lower it a little. But it's fucking insane and is driving me crazy and exhausting me. If anything she ought to be more accommodating, but she leaves no stone unturned to make my life even harder.

Somedays my patience runs out and I end up yelling to which she refuses to budge and I just end up crying out of frustration making everything worse, and concentrating even harder. Sometimes, I just want to yank her phone and throw her phone away with such a force that it shatters.

I have no other room in this house to study, and no other place I can go to, to study. I would have got noise cancelling earphones but there is something wrong with my ears, the earphones just keep popping out no matter how much I push them.

So any idea for a permanent solution, or what exactly should I say to my mother, how exactly should I beg/request her to SHOW SOME FUCKING EMPATHY?

**Problem no 2**- There is also something wrong with my body. I keep falling asleep after 30 mins-1 hour of studying. I have tried everything that occurred to me. Nothing works. It's not that I can't understand what I'm studying or I do not want to study, none of that. But I still keep falling asleep, against my wishes like someone has drugged me. And it only happens while studying

I have had this issue since I was 11 (and yes my mother never bothered to take me to a doctor, she blamed me that I'm the one being lazy and need to work hard to not sleep).

This maybe relevant- I was anaemic since 10 (or maybe even before that and it only got worse with time due to severe menorrhagia, it got so bad that my hb was at 5.7 this May and I had to insist my mother that she take me to a gynaecologist. My treatment is ongoing and a recent CBC showed my hb is currently at 11.5. I had thought that my sleeping problem was due to anaemia, but the problem didn't go away even though my hb has improved so much. It persisted and I'm just so done with all that is wrong with my body atp.

***Things I have tried to not fall asleep-***

* Drinking water
* Splashing my face with water (only works until my face is wet)
* Eating something
* Playing with a pen/pencil
* Continuously moving my teeth (up-down motion)
* Continuously moving any part of my body
* Trying really hard to keep my eyes open
* Taking notes
* Coffee (caffeine doesn't do shit to me when it comes to sleep, doesn't energize me or make my sleep go away at all)

During most of these, I don't fall asleep, but the sleepiness persists and it's no use coz you can't really focus when you are sleepy AF.

***Thing that have worked-***

* Splashing face with water, but a very short term solution
* Being shocked/embarrassed by something. That most happens by others tho. For eg, if a tea

In an ideal world, my mother would have gotten me the help that I needed long back, but this isn't the ideal world, so I'm here asking for any tips/advice from random strangers on reddit.

**Problem No 3-** My mother is fucking abusive (also she is already continously telling me that I won't be able to clear the exam, I don't have it in me) and my sister extremely irresponsible (I'm a huge hygiene freak, like I need the room to not be messy or dirty so that I can study, but she is lazy and doesn't do her work on time ever and I'm left having to do her work too and having to mentally burden myself with her share of work too, my mother doesn't help in anyway). Both of them cause me immense frustration and agony to the point I'm left pulling my hair out in frustration. I would cry but then I would just keep on crying and feel so humiliated, and disappointed and weak and I'd be left so exhausted. 

All this results in I CAN'T STUDY!!!! And the stress on top of all this is just making everything worse. I really just wanna die fr. Why am I stuck having to live such a shitty life.

So any idea on how can I let these feelings out?

I would journal but it's so time and effort consuming, if I start journaling I write around 10-15 pages and more.

So please guys, if you have ANY advice for any of my 3 problems, please please do let me know. I beg",1,1729026411.0,TwoXIndia,0,0.67,False

I‚Äôm LilacDewdrops, a 30-year-old Japanese-American (second generation/‚Äùnisei‚Äù) woman currently living in Stamford, Connecticut on a 9 month teaching fellowship! I have a huge passion for education and teaching and I see myself going down this path in the future.¬†

I‚Äôm 5 '4, deep brown almond shaped eyes and I have medium length dark brown hair. I have two pierced ears and three tattoos (I have a rose on my upper right shoulder, a small bluebird on my right hand and a lilac on my left inner forearm).¬†

I lead a healthy lifestyle: no soda, smoking, or drugs, and I prefer minimal drinking (Alcohol is expensive!). I enjoy early meals and quieter settings over loud parties, I prefer coffee and cake over booze and shots. I‚Äôm an old soul who values meaningful conversations and thoughtful experiences.¬†

Politically moderate and non-religious, I value kindness and respect. I‚Äôve never been married and don‚Äôt have children, but I‚Äôm open to the possibility of starting a family with the right person. When not working, I love writing, drawing, listening to synthwave, and watching 80s/90s films.¬†

I love watching *Gossip Girl*‚Äîthe original 2007 series, not the 2021 reboot! It would be fantastic to have a partner who‚Äôd enjoy watching it with me. My top five favorite films are *Dogfight*, *Stand By Me*, *Career Opportunities*, *Secret Admirer*, and *The Bling Ring* (the 2013 adaptation). As for music, I‚Äôm really into songs like ‚ÄúSunset‚Äù by The Midnight, ‚ÄúSummer Eyes‚Äù by Coastal, ‚ÄúBig City Lights‚Äù by Nitrate, ‚ÄúMiracle Love‚Äù by Lazer Club, and ‚ÄúDangerous Love‚Äù by Lazer Club.

While I enjoy my own company, I‚Äôm looking to share my life with someone special. I seek a partner who feels like my best friend, someone I‚Äôve known my whole life‚Äîsomeone to wake up next to, share life‚Äôs small moments with, and build a connection grounded in genuine friendship and mutual respect. I miss having someone to laugh with over the silliest things, create inside jokes, rest my head on their shoulder, and feel their arms around me. I long for those intimate moments, looking into their eyes as they cup my face with their hands. They say relationships are built on a foundation of friendship, with romance and passion making up the rest. I want us to have a cute, healthy relationship while also genuinely liking each other as people. Does that make sense?

I‚Äôm seeking a relationship that‚Äôs happy, sweet, and filled with joy‚Äîwhere we can share tender moments, enjoy each other‚Äôs company, and be there for one another during challenging times. I want us to share everything, from our daily experiences to our family stories, both the good and the bad‚Äîanything that brings us closer together!

1g4icyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g4icyl/hr_the_taste_of_him/,[HR] The Taste of Him ,"The Taste of Him 

I‚Äôd been watching him for weeks‚Äîhis heartbeat steady, his scent thick with promise. After a thousand years, every human began to smell the same. They were prey, fragile, predictable, and disposable. But this one‚Ä¶ something about him caught my attention, and I wasn‚Äôt sure why.

He wasn‚Äôt extraordinary. At least not on the surface. Just another human, living in his box of an apartment, working his mundane job, playing his games at night. Yet there was something about him that made me want to linger. Made me want to watch.

I told myself it was just hunger that kept me coming back. But no matter how many others I hunted, how much blood I drank, I found myself returning to him. Always at a distance, always in the shadows, but always there.

His name was Gabriel, and he was oblivious to my presence. I watched the way he moved about his space‚Äîalways so routine. Wake up. Coffee. Work. Home. Dinner. Video games. Sleep. There was a strange comfort in his repetition, in the way he bit his lip when he focused too hard on a screen, in the casual sweep of his hand through his hair when he glanced in the mirror.

I had memorized his habits, even his scent, which I could trace through the air long before I saw him. I knew the way his pulse quickened after climbing the stairs to his apartment. The way it slowed when he sank into the couch, switching on the TV, a small sigh of relief escaping his lips as if his body was finally able to relax.

And yet, despite everything I knew about him, there was one thing I didn‚Äôt understand‚Äîwhy I was waiting. Why I hadn‚Äôt struck.

I‚Äôd stalked men before. Hundreds. Thousands. Some for a night, others for weeks. But I had never hesitated to kill. Never paused long enough to wonder who they were or what they did with their lives. This was different. Gabriel was different.

I found myself imagining our encounter. Planning it in my head with a detail that startled me. What would I say? How would I approach him? Should I wear something specific? I‚Äôd catch my reflection in windows or mirrors, inspecting my appearance, an absurd act for a vampire. I didn‚Äôt age; I didn‚Äôt change. What was I even worried about?

I shouldn't be worrying. I was a predator, and he was prey. I had torn through the throats of men far stronger than him without a second thought. But with Gabriel, the thought gnawed at me. Would he find me appealing? Would he be scared? I wanted him to see me, to know me in a way I couldn‚Äôt explain.

It was an emotion I hadn‚Äôt felt in centuries‚Äîa stirring of something long dead inside me. Curiosity? Attraction?

No. That was impossible. I was a cold-blooded killer. My heart hadn‚Äôt beat in a thousand years. But the longer I watched him, the harder it became to remember that.

The night I finally decided to act, the city was cloaked in silence. It was late. Gabriel was alone, as usual, immersed in one of his video games, his face lit by the faint glow of the screen. I waited until he finished, until he rose to head toward bed. His routine was predictable, as always.

I followed him silently, my movements fluid, barely a whisper in the night. He had no idea I was there.

This was it. I would feed tonight. I would break whatever strange spell he had over me, and things would go back to the way they had always been. I would kill him, drink my fill, and move on.

But as I closed the distance, ready to strike, something inside me faltered. I watched the rise and fall of his chest as he slept, his breathing slow and peaceful. His scent enveloped me, thick and inviting, and I felt my fangs ache in anticipation.

Still, I hesitated.

Why was I hesitating?

Anger flared in me. I was Macha. The vampire who had ended kings and emperors without a second thought. I was a force of nature, unfeeling, unyielding. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to care.

With a snarl, I leaned in, my lips brushing his neck, my fangs extending just enough to pierce the skin. The first taste of his blood sent a shock through my body.

I jerked back, stumbling away from him as if I had been burned.

What was that?

His blood‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt like any other I had tasted before. There was warmth to it, a burning, pulsing sensation that coursed through my veins, awakening something deep inside me‚Äîsomething I had long forgotten.

For the first time in centuries, I felt‚Ä¶ alive.

The taste of him lingered on my tongue, sweet and intoxicating, but it was more than that. It was the way his blood connected me to him in that moment, as if I could feel everything he was‚Äîhis emotions, his thoughts, his fears, and dreams.

This was dangerous.

I wanted more.

But I couldn‚Äôt take it. I couldn‚Äôt drain him. Not now. Not like this.

My hands trembled as I reached out, brushing his skin where I had bitten him, healing the wound with a careful touch. I watched him stir in his sleep, unaware of what had just happened, of how close he had come to death.

I stepped back into the shadows, my heart pounding in a way it hadn‚Äôt for a thousand years. What was happening to me? Why did he affect me like this?

I needed answers, but I knew I wouldn‚Äôt find them tonight. Tomorrow, I would find him again. This time, I wouldn‚Äôt strike. I would talk to him. I would see him as more than prey. I needed to know who Gabriel was, what made him different.

For the first time in a thousand years, I wanted something more than blood. And

1g4icdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourtownreno/comments/1g4icdh/what_does_reno_need/,What does Reno Need? ,"A recent Reno subreddit prompt by sandwichdepression asked ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a business in Reno you wish existed?‚Äù which led to a barrage of interesting answers of what‚Äôs missing in general from the 775.  
  
One of the most upvoted answers was by blubirdie wanting the Aldi German supermarket chain, Ikea and lots more doctors here.  
  
The doctor suggestion got a slew of replies from frustrated waitlisted parents with their referrals expiring.    
  
Other leading answers sought a not so expensive but still good dim sum restaurant, a decent croissant that won‚Äôt blow your wallet, a self help garage for car work, a good Asian supermarket, an air museum or even an aviation inspired coffee shop, a Daiso, a Yard House, an aquarium, a recreational marijuana consumption lounge, a Jollibee, a Crate and Barrel, additional psychiatric hospitals for the uninsured, a White Castle, a Shakey‚Äôs Pizza, decent public transportation, a PC gaming center, and good Puerto Rican food.   
  
That‚Äôs a lot to unpack and deliver.    
  
Since it went in multiple directions, we would add more walkable areas in urban cores, safe parking areas for those living in their vehicles, more trash cans, wash stations and public toilets in parks and downtown areas, and of course way more accessible, affordable housing, whatever is needed to make that happen, and not stop working until it does.  
  
While we are at it, why not more transparency from our elected officials and government managers so that we can determine if they are really working for the benefit of the community, or if it‚Äôs sadly for their own ego trips and backroom deals to remain as powerful, well compensated, cliquish, back scratching affluent figures.

I'm happy about it but the rational part of me still thinks that it's a coincidence. ,"Okay, so basically, I've only tried **manifesting seriously about 2 or 3** times in my life.

The first time was last year, when I discovered this subreddit and watched the movie *The Secret*. I was struggling with anxiety (still am), and overall, it was a tough time for me, so the idea of having what I wanted really excited me. But unfortunately, I'm the type of person who tends to lose interest quickly if I'm not actively doing stuff, so the whole ""I'm going to try manifesting"" phase lasted about 2 or 3 weeks. It went like this because I didn‚Äôt know where to start, I felt overwhelmed by all the different methods and I still needed to believe that manifesting and visualizing actually worked, since I‚Äôm a very rational person.

*I read that you should start with something small, so I decided to manifest a coffee. I just focused hard and told myself that I would get a coffee. Then, one day the following week, one of my classmates came up to me with two coffees in hand and offered me one.*

At the time, I thought *maybe* I had manifested it, but I convinced myself it was *just a random act*‚Äîthings like that usually happen at school. After that, I stopped manifesting because I felt I needed a specific method, technique, or something concrete to achieve results. Plus, I had bigger problems going on in my life.

Now, a year later, I stumbled upon this subreddit again, specifically a post about someone receiving a sign. After reading other stories, I felt motivated to try manifesting again with more determination. I didn‚Äôt look up any techniques, and yesterday, before going to sleep, I randomly decided to test my belief by asking the universe for a small sign: a coin.

*I thought, ""A coin, I‚Äôll get a coin,"" and kept repeating it in my mind with determination that I wanted to manifest a coin in the coming days. Then, I decided to be more specific and asked for a* ***2‚Ç¨ coin****. I fell asleep and even dreamed about the coin, lol.*

Today, after finishing an exam, I got into my friend‚Äôs car in the front passenger seat. One of my other friends in the backseat found a coin on the floor and showed it to the friend driving‚Äîit was a 2‚Ç¨ coin. At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of it, but then I remembered my attempt to manifest it the night before. My mind tries to rationalize it, but I want to believe this was a successful manifestation.

I would just like to know if there‚Äôs anyone else who is very rational and how they manage to believe in the law of attraction. I also struggle a bit with anxiety and depression and would like advice on how to stop thinking negatively about life, like how to stop believing that getting what I want is hard or that I can't manage to have good things.

1g4ia9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1g4ia9w/followup_on_daily_enemas_or_daily_liquid_glycerin/,Followup on daily enemas or daily liquid glycerin,"A couple of months ago I posted this:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1ep5yyg](https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1ep5yyg)   .... People were suggesting that the daily water enemas could disrupt the flora, and it makes sense that it would.  I was considering a switch to daily liquid glycerin suppositories.

So the big news is, I made the switch!  After years of daily enemas, I am no longer dependent on the water-bag and in fact haven't used it at all in a couple of weeks.  I've switched to daily liquid glycerin (without bisacodyl) and it gives a natural urge.  My stools have been somewhat well-formed, somewhere close to the middle of the Bristol stool chart, not liquefied nor hard pieces.

And I feel better... My overall mood has improved and I have less anxiety.  A few days after making this change, I noticed a more restful feeling of well-being that wasn't quite there before.  It has to be helping my health and giving the flora more of a chance to colonize instead of getting wiped out daily.

Also a few of my bowel movements have been happening without even using the glycerin, if I ate enough soft-cooked vegetables previously.    Exercise seems to help also to make that happen.  This seems like a good sign, but there's no certainty that this can happen every day, so my default will be to use the liquid glycerin.  Also I bought a liter of liquid glycerin, and I'll be cleaning out and refilling the Fleet glycerin applicators, so I don't just use a lot of plastic that gets thrown away.

My next step is to focus on restoring the flora... I've been looking into Bifidobacterium supplements.  I met a guy who makes his own Bifido-only yogurt (no Lactobacillus, as he claims it causes more issues, inflammation, histamine reactions).  He's helping me get set up to make yogurt at home (using a sous vide) with a high dosage of several Bifido strains.  I'll probably also be taking it in capsules, enteric-coated prebiotics (specific to Bifido strains) as well as enteric-coated Bifido probiotics.  My hope is that these strains (some of which are proven to help IBS, such as the strain in Align -- number 35624) will heal the gut and help my overall health improve even more, on top of my recovery from the dependency on the water enemas.

Just wanted to share this, as it's been a long journey -- over 7 years of using enemas nearly every day.  And knowing all the while that I needed to stop, but not knowing how to have consistent bowel movements without it.  For awhile I would drink strong black coffee or espresso daily, right after eating a few peaches, and that did it.  But my body isn't doing well with caffeine these days, too many headaches and too much stress -- so that's out of the question.  I just feel lucky to have found something that works, and a new horizon.  It's incredible how drastically pooping affects our mood, mental health, stress, sleep, illness, immunity etc. for better or worse.  Thanks for reading.",1,1729025980.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

One afternoon, I suddenly felt a stomach-ache and suspected that Dufferin gang (hostile forces) wanted to kill me and instruct my colleagues to poison my coffee. I went to the police station to report the case, but the police looked at me while I was talking; there is no record, no response. I left the police station and wanted to go to the hospital, but I knew that I would have to wait for more than ten hours to see a doctor in the hospital, which was unbearable, so I went home.

I have been thinking about what happened between me and Troupe Leader Liu, and I think he has not come to tease me since 2004. I have linked together the story of the entire [Chapter 2 ""Peach Blossom Catastrophe""](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1f7ssof/21_Ê°ÉËä±Âä´‰πã‰∏Ä_peach_flower_catastrophe_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (note, but I have not yet recalled the events of Chapters 1 to 3), and I think I have figured out the eight words ‚ÄúFormer Generation‚Äôs Marriage Factors, Predetermining Fate‚Äù. I have always been fascinated by the Buddhist ‚Äúintelligence of not seeing the top‚Äù (i.e. God's Eye), but I didn't expect Troupe Leader Liu to use it on me. I feel like a beast. He is so old and dying of illness. He repeatedly asked people to send me messages to visit him, but I was like a donkey, indifferent, self-inflicted sin, not deserving to live!

Suddenly, I felt my internal organs moving, and ‚Äúill air‚Äù were running all over my body. I had practiced meditation when I was a child ([see chapter 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1daas4e/12_meditation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), so I didn't find this kind of tactile hallucination strange, but the scale and intensity of the ‚Äúill air‚Äù shocked me. I quickly lay down on the bed to avoid fainting fall.

I felt a diaphragm section appear under my chest (as shown in Illustration 10.2.1-A), with no air circulation and gastrointestinal tract movement (note, this is called intestinal obstruction in modern medicine). I immediately adjusted my breathing and drove ‚ÄúTrue Air‚Äù down along the Ren Mai to impact the middle section. As soon as the ‚ÄúTrue Air‚Äù touched the section, the section collapsed. Soon, the ‚ÄúIll Air‚Äù reshaped and reorganized, blocking the chest (about the Shan Zhong acupoint, commonly known as the middle Dantian). I continued to adjust my breathing and used the Qi (i.e., True Air) down along the Ren Mai to impact the heavy and cold evil Qi (i.e., Ill Air) blocking my chest. After a few minutes, I opened the Ren Mai, my body and the peristalsis of stomach returned to normal. After I calmed down, I thought to myself: I have never experienced such a temporary palpitation before; I can't let my imagination run wild!

After a while, I stopped caring about what happened and started to blame myself again: I am a piece of shit, this is not what a human being does. Suddenly, I felt something moving all over my body, and I quickly lay flat on the bed. My flesh was slightly bumpy and pulsating. The bumpy and pulsating phenomenon was a little more severe. From the Ming Men acupoint (the two kidneys in the lower back), a feeling of electric arcs was emitted along the skin surface, spreading like water ripples; the two arcs collided in the front abdomen. Then, there were multiple large and small electric circles all over my body, which were wrapped around my limbs and my entire body, moving up and down, just like a CT scan, but I was experiencing multiple electric circles moving up and down to scan my body. There were multiple small electric circles moving up and down on my two arms and two legs. Suddenly, Qi (i.e., Air) surged from all parts of my body, accompanied by electric currents, and gathered towards Dantian (as shown in illustration 10.2.1-B) at a speed several times faster than the countdown. After gathering in Dantian, it immediately exploded. With the explosion, the fragmented Qi (i.e., air) spread to all parts of my body.

I thought happily: Oh my! Big explosion, all sutras (i.e., the lines in the acupuncture chart, see figs. 10.2.1) are shaken open! When I was a child, I read the description of this phenomenon in a meditation book, that all the sutras will be opened. However, what was happening was different from the legend. After a few seconds, the whole body, including the flesh on my face, had a clear bumpy up and down phenomenon, like the boiling water surface; my whole body was boiling and vibrating. I said to myself: ""Calm down! Keep calm! Don't panic!"" The bumpy and jumping phenomenon of the whole body continued for a few seconds, and gradually subsided. At this time, I was lying flat on the bed, paying attention to the abnormal movements of various parts of my body.

The air that was scattered all over the body became cool, and as it flowed, it gathered in hundreds of small areas, accompanied by the feeling of electric current, coldness, and uneven beating of diseased air (or evil air). I realized that this was not a good phenomenon! It was not the comfortable and cool feeling described in the book. I felt that dozens of large vagal rheumatic airs did not go through the sutras, but went straight to my heart, gathering as they moved. Some vagal rheumatic airs moved very fast, for example, centimeters per second.

I immediately became nervous. If the vagal rheumatic air invaded the heart, and the heart is a mass of muscle, if it trembled strangely like this, wouldn't it be a myocardial infarction!? I was having a Heart Attack! When I was a child, I heard my grandmother talk about this many times. Once she was angry and fell asleep under the shade of a tree outside. Between half asleep and half awake, she felt as if a stream of air entered her heart. From then on, she suffered from heart disease.

I immediately took action to protect my heart, ignoring other organs. I began to use my ‚Äútrue air‚Äù to attack the ‚Äúvagal rheumatic air‚Äù that was close to my heart and moved quickly. Fortunately, those ‚Äúevil airs‚Äù were very fragile, and they dispersed once they were touched by my ‚Äútrue air‚Äù. In a short period of time, I defeated more than a dozen ‚Äúvagal rheumatic air‚Äù groups. At this time, I found that several major rheumatic airs moved slowly, and most of the rheumatic airs did not move. I calmed down.

Illustration 10.2.1-2 originated from ancient Mexico, indicating that ancient American had a similar theory of ‚Äútrue air‚Äù (i.e. acupuncture and meditation theory; cf. chapter 12) as Chinese. Illustration 10.2.1-4 is the coffin cover of Lord Pacal (aka. Gold Boy, Tlaloc, Jaguar) in the seventh century CE, depicting the cause and effect of his falling into hell. The upper part of the picture shows a cross or ‚Äúphilosopher-stone sword‚Äù inserted into his abdomen, indicating that he was crucified, was critically ill. At the bottom of the picture, his lion head is in a fire box, indicating that King Pakal fell into the ""fire path"" (i.e. hell, mental illness). Above the fire box is his godfather's coffin, indicating that King Pakal was sent to hell by the information that ""his godfather had passed away"". The coffin is empty, leaving only three pieces of residue left after the corpse exploded (i.e. three pieces of Buddha's bones, human bones), indicating that King Pakal's body exploded after hearing the news of his godfather's death, so he fell into hell, that is, he suffered from mental illness. The coffin is shown with an ejaculating penis that can lift the coffin, indicating that King Pakal's de facto marriage with Chalchiuhtlicue (aka.

I was confused about what Troupe Leader Liu had done to me; but the conflict between me and him was that I disagreed with his decision that ""I, Luyan, is Eve Liu's husband"" ([cf. v. 8.2 ""Die with Eyes Open""](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1fnagmc/82_Ê≠ª‰∏çÁûëÁõÆ_die_with_eyes_open/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)). I had very little ‚Äútrue air‚Äù left (note, gathering and transporting ‚Äútrue air‚Äù requires a lot of physical strength and time), but my whole body was full of rheumatism. I was already facing death, surrendered.

I knelt on the bed and swore: ""Eve Liu is my wife; Troupe Leader Liu is my father-in-law; I will pursue her and marry her."" I kept muttering: ""Eve Liu's father is my father-in-law; Eve Liu is my wife."" I know that oaths have a strong control over people's thoughts. Mumbling out loud like this helps me concentrate my thoughts and energy and is very helpful in preventing loose consciousness from conflicting and destroying my main consciousness and eliminating psychological contradictions.

I found the acupuncture sutra map I collected. The ‚Äútrue air‚Äù will move faster, smoother and stronger in the sutras. I first planned the route of ‚Äútrue air‚Äù flow on the sutra map, the shortest and most powerful angle to hit the rheumatism, then used ‚Äútrue air‚Äù to attack the rheumatism. After breaking up a few more clusters of rheumatism, I found that the vagal rheumatism moved slower. I moved ‚Äútrue air‚Äù along the ‚ÄúShou Shao Yin heart sutra‚Äù (as shown in Figure 10.2.1-C), wrapped my heart with ‚Äútrue airs‚Äù. In this way, the weak vagal rheumatism would not have the opportunity to get close to my heart.

At this time, I thought that I must eat well, sleep well, and stay healthy to fight against the vagal rheumatism in my body. If my physical health deteriorated, I might develop rheumatic heart disease at some point, and I would become a disabled person even if I didn't die. I said goodbye to my wife and children, but I didn't say it clearly, they didn't understand. I was afraid that I didn't know to protect my heart in my dreams, so before going to bed, I took a hot bath to balance the body temperature and reduce dreaming. I lay in bed, regulating my breathing and concentrating my intention, then extinguished the preconscious and handed over the control of the mind and body to the unconscious (anciently known as God-sense). The Buddhist scriptures say that in this state, people have extremely strong healing power, equivalent to Gods and Buddhas.

The symptoms described in the previous three sections are called Conversion Disorder in modern medicine (as shown in Figure 10.2.3-1), which is a rare mental illness. In the process of fighting rheumatism in the following years, I continued to study and now believe that this disease is caused by this. I have been in awe of Troupe Leader Liu since I was a child and wanted to worship him as my teacher (a yearning that I don‚Äôt even know myself). In Chapter 8, after meeting Eve Liu, I had a deep ‚ÄúGratitude Resentment Love and Hatred‚Äù relationship with Troupe Leader Liu. Subsequently, my ‚ÄúGratitude Resentment Love and Hatred‚Äù relationship with Troupe Leader Liu continued to develop for another six years, but I never met him, so in my mind he was a ball of white mist. The mist is the ‚ÄúPresent Quantity‚Äù ([see 11.4.5 Sense Node](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1d6f8pp/1145_sense_node/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)), representing Troupe Leader Liu, and is the object of my attachment to all my feelings and memories of Troupe Leader Liu. When I realized that he had passed away, this information was received by my unconsciousness (anciently known as God-sense), the ball of mist disappeared, because the unconscious only processes ‚ÄúPresent Quantity‚Äù, and Troupe Leader Liu is no longer the ‚ÄúPresent Quantity‚Äù. In this way, all my feelings and memories towards Troupe Leader Liu lost their attachment, which caused great confusion and resulted in the ""conversion disorder"" mentioned above.

The illness described in the previous three sections is an extreme form of Hysteria (anciently known as Ghost Illness), called the Holy Ghost. Illustration 10.2.3-2 is from ancient Mexico and is a Tlaloc (Gold Boy) who was in hell. The top of the statue is the ancient Mexican representation of the Holy Ghost. On the front of the statue, the Holy Ghost is attacking Tlaloc with many penises representing vagal rheumatism. The penises represent that the cause of vagal rheumatism in Tlaloc is his marriage dispute with Chalchiuhtlicue (Jade Girl). Illustration 10.2.3-3 is the ‚ÄúPhilosopher-Stone Pestle‚Äù in Buddhism; the top of (4), (8), and (9) are sculptures representing the Holy Ghost. The essence of the Holy Ghost is shame; in front of Troupe Leader Liu, I always feel ashamed and am a sinner.

The first three sections describe the phenomena of the ""Die with Eyes Open"" curse erupting in me. Later I found that it had the same meaning as the ""three unforgivable curses"" mentioned by Westerners. I learned that the three unforgivable curses mentioned by Westerners, ""Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus‚Äù, are exactly the descriptions of the phenomena caused by the ‚ÄúDie with Eyes Open‚Äù.

It has only 2 leads so colors are either white or amber/yellow depending on lead polarity. These are used in coffee machines to illuminate the cup area. Dia is about 7mm and length about 20mm, looks like there is regular clear LED casted inside.

Would this be called bipolar LED?

Any idea where to find something similar? I'm not concerned about the exact shape, since it can be casted in clear epoxy or similar compound to match the existing package.

We both were very heart broken on that day but life makes wild turns sometimes.

I know I made a huge mistake in life by having an affair when married to my wife, and we both (myself and woman I had affair with) felt really unhappy as we cheated our respective partners and I am also feeling very sorry about my children and wife who doesn't even know that the affair existed.

I met her back 3 years ago, in a birthday party. It was the birthday party of a friend of my son. She was the birthday boy's mother. While I saw her for the first time, I was amazed and stund by her beauty. She was having a wavy salt and peppered hair, she was very fair, her eyes were like the petals of Lotus and they sparked like bright stars at the night, she was a 38, but very young woman . I can't look at anything except her, and even never bothered about her husband standing nearby and was in a state of excitement. I was thinking about her the whole week. I got a chance to meet her again in a parents and teachers meet held at my son's school.

She smiled seeing me, and I can never forget her smile even today. It is a wine, that never faded away from my mind, it just became more overwhelming. I was having a long conversation with her on that day for the first time. People call me funny and we both were laughing hard and I never missed a chance to appreciate her beauty that day. She herself asked for my number and we began to chat, not always but once in a very long time.

Days rolled and she badly needed a favour from me as her husband was arrested in an issue. I got involved, I know some influential people across the town and I backed her husband and was instrumental in his release. For that she gifted me a new watch, which I am wearing write now while writing this answer, only this watch was with me when I was with her. Then we became very close. She used to call me whenever free talked some stuffs. Later on, as both myself and her worked in the same locality, we started meeting up for coffee and dinner sometimes.

Slowly she too felt she was attracted. She started flirting with me. I became more open, both flirted as well as credited her beauty, She blushed everytime when I did that.

Something I even today feel really bad for... happened üòî. That day, as her husband was away for a working trip, she invited me for some paper work she had and needed my help. It was about 11 am, first we watched a movie together and then I went on to work for her. I can feel both us were unable to control our lusts. Suddenly she said she has fell in love with me and hugged me tightly. That was the first time, she hugged me. I was not on earth and was floating around at that moment, I too hugged her and kissed her on forehead. I should have stopped atleast at that moment, but we ended up having sex that day, she was the only woman other than my wife with whom I had sex. I took a bath and went home but that time I wasn't happy and I took a decision: to never do that damn thing again.

Next day, both of us apologized each other, and we were together again. She became pregnant due to my act but took pills to abort it, she had health issues but she never blamed me for that. We started travelling to many places. Visited theatres, parks, malls and many more. I took her to parties and we danced together.

She was my biggest support, even more than my wife. She supported me emotionally. Aided me by doing some financial helps. She showed me true love that I only saw from my mother.

Days passed, and one day we met for one last time. Both our sons completed their tenth standard, and I went to her house and she was alone. She invited me to say a good bye as her husband was transferred to some other city and her son was willing to study there and wanted to move on to a good school.

Our eyes completely turned wet. She was hissing and her eyes became red. I hugged her very tightly and she held my shoulders and we were holding each other tightly for more than some minutes and were crying hardly. My shoulders became wet of her tears and finally we locked our lips for a while.

As she left, she tried to contact me again. But this time, I never gave her that chance, blocked her and brought a new sim card so that she would forget me, move on and so that the affair would end. I know it would be painful and harsh but later on I got used to it, and my two years of colourful life came to an end. Though even today I can't forget her but still I did that for the future of my sons and my family. Got to know from a friend of mine that she is having a very good time with her husband, but I know she would be in pain, atleast somewhere at the bottom of her heart. But sometimes it's better to enjoy the pain for making people around us happy. Right??",0,1729025523.0,TrueOffMyChest,10,0.5,False

I met with the mother a few times and we had coffee and just talked, she became on of my friends.

I was talking to one of my best friends who works there with me and she thinks it's because the school has done a lot of illegal things, and not up to date on paperwork and since that specific mom has been filing complaints against the school the administration is scared i gave information to the mom about all that stuff when truthfully i haven't, and they have no proof that i do. but regardless are they legally allowed to fire me for that? especially considering they are not even students anymore.",1,1729025504.0,EmploymentLaw,2,1.0,False

Sometimes my body just forgets sleep exists and I can't even so much as close my eyes without them forcing open let alone dream for 2 nights, I swear it's like I need less and less sleep but can't do anything for 9 hours or else one footstep somehow wakes the neighbors. And you might be thinking ""maybe try just laying there for 4 minutes?""I tried, believe me, i even tried just pretending to sleep. But usually pretending to sleep to fall asleep will decreases my chances of me falling asleep it's a miracle that I haven't broken a world record for longest time awake by 2 months and somehow survived, because even if I didn't need to sleep I would've still been able to sleep, and I know my body. I'm the tiredest, laziest person who can get up, stretch, meditate, eat 3

meals, take one minute to get ready for the morning and go back to bed without even setting up a schedule! And when I do sleep, my dream is real life for 4 minutes until a dinosaur or explosion or some jazz wakes me up before I can get to the fun part when I know that I'm asleep and start lucid dreaming and suddenly ""üéµpepsi maaaaan!üéµ the benevolent, the unstoppable! The magnificent! The super! The guy with every superpower under the comic book drawn sun! And the famous unkillable soda commerci- I mean superhero!"" It's a pain trying to get some unobtainable brain rest, that's all. And I may have proven and diagnosed attentive type adhd, and I've heard that neurodivergency can affect your sleep patterns, but im too convinced that it makes no sense how the one person who can't get sleep hears ""wow, I feel amazing."" Come out of his mouth when he was tossing and turning and kicking himself on accident trying to find a good position to sleep in, WHY DO I LIE TO MYSELF!? I feel like a hotdogs ran over by a car and eaten up by an actual dog that so happens to be krypton the superdog! In the words of burger King, ""have it your way, circadian rhythm!! You actual bag of trash!!""

One incident happened while I was just walking past Flinders St station. On the other occasion I was buying a coffee in Starbucks and an off leash dog ran into the store and bailed us up in a corner. These are terrifying attacks and they take months for my dog to recover from (and hundreds of dollars in re-training and vet care). These aggressive dogs are owned by equally aggressive humans who hand around the city begging. Council and Police say they are unable to move them along because they ‚Äòneed to treat rough sleepers with respect‚Äô (quoting council worker). Both incidents were captured on CCTV, but still no consequences. One of the offending dogs was dragging a rope behind him while his jaws were locked on my dog‚Äôs rear-end, therefore was not technically off-leash.

I would like to advocate for all bully breeds to be required to be leashed AND MUZZLED in public, for the safety of disabled Assistance Dog users, but also children or the elderly or anyone else who might be at risk of this kind of attack. How do I go about starting this kind of movement? Which level of government should I petition to create a law that would actually be enforced? Council regulations are pointless‚Ä¶ these people have no fixed address and the most staff can do is offer the homeless owners free registration, which makes no sense to me nor any difference to public safety.

1g4i0ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1g4i0ey/espresso_grinder_under_300/,Espresso grinder under [$300],"Hi everyone, I am in the market for an electric grinder and need some suggestions.

Currently, I have a Flair 58 and am hand grinding with a 1zpresso JX-Pro and I'd like to upgrade to electric.

I would like something that has a good user experience/workflow for single dosing, is reliable, doesn't have plastic in the interior, preferably grinds quietly, and is matte black to match the flair.

I was initially looking at the Baratza Encore ESP, but found out it has plastic parts that could degrade and end up in your coffee. It also seems like this wouldn't be as good as some other options in the sub $300 range.

Then, I started looking at the DF54, but heard issues about reliability (inconsistent retention, gets clogged, Turin and MiiCoffee having poor customer support). It has flat burrs, which is interesting, but not sure if I really care. It seems like conical may be the way to go for an espresso focused grinder, but conical/flat burrs aren't a deal breaker for me, as long as the burrs don't make the coffee taste weird (subjective, i know). Also, this grinder is kind of ugly. Not a huge deal, but it is a factor. On the plus side, I hear it is relatively quiet and will be much faster to grind than my manual grinder \~ 24 seconds vs \~ 2 minutes.

Now, I am considering the Varia VS3. I hear there are some reliability issues with the grinder's motor, and the company doesn't have amazing customer support, but seems to be better than the DF54 on that front. This grinder looks better than the DF54 in my opinion, but it seems like it may be louder and grind longer than the DF54, which could be an issue, since my wife and kids are usually asleep when I make my coffee in the morning.

I could look into the SK40 grinder maybe, but what are your suggestions? Would you recommend one of the above grinders, or do you have a different grinder that I should look into?",1,1729025264.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

For some context, my job is in central London, and my commute is about 1.5 hours each way. I‚Äôm currently on maternity leave, and my little one just turned 3 months old. My manager, who I‚Äôve worked with for 5 years, is leaving the company soon and moving abroad. I had planned to visit this week to say goodbye, but the day I was supposed to go, it was pouring rain, and my baby had a rough night with a runny nose and mucus in his throat. I didn‚Äôt want to drag him out in the rain, and I also hadn‚Äôt really considered the logistics‚Äîthere are a lot of stairs at the stations I‚Äôd need to use, and none of them have step-free access. I‚Äôd constantly be asking people to help me lift the pram, and I started questioning whether it was worth it to travel 3 hours for just an hour or so of meeting for coffee, especially with my baby being unwell.

To add to that, my manager was really difficult with me during my maternity leave (as I‚Äôve mentioned before in previous posts), but since I had my baby prematurely, she‚Äôs been super nice. I can‚Äôt help but wonder if it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs worried I might have made a complaint. I don‚Äôt plan on returning to this job, which they don‚Äôt know yet. After I canceled our meeting, my manager invited me to pop in next month when the team is celebrating another colleague going on maternity leave, but honestly, I can‚Äôt be bothered with the fakeness.

Would it be too obvious if I just said I have a trip booked that coincides with that date from now?

Fatigue was also the reason I joined this sub. Some of you might not be fatigued because you‚Äôre getting older or because you‚Äôre doing too much. A lot of you have adrenal fatigue from CAFFEINE. I stumbled on the decaf sub and was reading the posts and the light bulb in my head turned on. I‚Äôve been trying to cure my fatigue for a decade. I had a rough time with my parents dying and a few lawsuits and I just became run down. I‚Äôve been drinking coffee since I was a teenager since my parents drank it non stop. Got a little older and started drinking ice coffee daily. Haven‚Äôt taken a break from coffee in 20 years plus coke at dinner or with meals and the occasional energy drink. I stopped drinking coffee a week ago and haven‚Äôt consumed any caffeine since. The first 3 days were hard and I‚Äôm not 100% better but the difference I feel is mind blowing even on the days where I sleep 5 hours ( two young kids) I have energy through the entire day. I don‚Äôt doom scroll anymore and when I want to go to sleep if I close my eyes I‚Äôm asleep in a few minutes instead of mulling everything over repeatedly for hours. I went on trt, got an adderal prescription and tried everything. All the supplements listed for fatigue et. Guys, if you‚Äôre exhausted all the time and if you wake up after sleeping for 8+ hours and feel like you‚Äôve been hit by a train and have to wait 2 hours for the energy that will only last until 1 or 2 pm just to feel like you can‚Äôt go another step because you‚Äôre so tired it might be caffeine and adrenal fatigue.

1g4hux2,https://www.reddit.com/r/hallucination/comments/1g4hux2/pretty_sure_i_hallucinated_seeing_broken_eggs_in/,Pretty sure I hallucinated seeing broken eggs in the egg carton this morning.,"I maybe got 3 hours of sleep last night. I made coffee with milk after I showered. A few hours later I made two fried eggs with breakfast. I remember being disgusted because multiple eggs in the carton were broken, I picked up a couple and felt that they were slimy so I felt around for two normal ones and grabbed those. I didn‚Äôt remove the cracked ones as I thought that someone would get them later. Half an hour later I feel really ill. I force myself to take a nap all while trying not to puke. 

Family member gets home 3ish hours later and I text her and tell her that I feel really ill and some of the eggs in the carton are bad. She says they‚Äôre fine. I tell her to look again. She come angrily knocking on my door saying that none of them are broken. I force myself to get up and look despite feeling like there are knives in my stomach. I pull the carton out of the fridge and check every single egg and none are broken. The weirder part is that the order of eggs is different, like I know I pulled out 2 eggs from different spots than the empty spaces I saw. The latch that closes the egg carton is also functional, as this morning the Styrofoam was noticeably broken and wouldn‚Äôt latch. 

Which brings me to my conclusion. I either ate two noticeably bad cracked eggs this morning, I hallucinated the eggs being cracked, or my family member swapped this carton of eggs for a normal carton of eggs stored somewhere else in the fridge. The last option isn‚Äôt that weird since she will buy multiple cartons sometimes.

Just feeling embarrassed and confused. Also a little ashamed to be completely honest. I‚Äôm glad I never tried to drive anywhere this morning if my brain is making all this up because what if I hallucinated while driving and hurt myself or someone else?",1,1729024891.0,hallucination,1,1.0,False

1g4hpgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1g4hpgt/thinking_about_staying_in_koeji_or_shimokitazawa/,Thinking about staying in Koeji or Shimokitazawa and I have some questions. ,"Hello everyone, 

I am currently in the process of planning my third visit to Tokyo and am looking at areas to stay at. My first trip I stayed in Asakusa and I genuinely really liked the area but I thought it was a bit far from things I wanted to do and I want to try a new area. My second trip I stayed in Shinjuku which was way too crazy for me and I would not recommend it. Although participating in the nightlife was fun, it was not enjoyable to have to stay in it.

Anyways so that brings me to my questions today. I hear that Koeji and Shimokitazawa are fun areas to visit and hang out, but what are those areas like to stay in for a couple days or a week? What about Nakano? My thought process is that on a map, these areas seem fairly close to a lot of activities that I have planned in Shinjuku and Shibuya, yet will be a lot more calmer with still a cool unique vibe. 


My ideal morning would be waking up early to get coffee, walking around a park and some neighborhood streets, and maybe doing a bit of light window shopping before beginning the day with main activities or a trip. So I guess im looking for a quieter neighborhood with a cool vibe that also has good shopping, coffee, and restaurants. Would these areas be good for that or is there another area that you would recommend? I really enjoy thrift shopping which is another reason that drew my interest to these places.

Thanks so much for the advice in advance and I look forward to seeing where you guys suggest as a good place to stay! Thanks cheers! 


Edit: I also want to add, I think it‚Äôs interesting I had to ask this as people usually are asking what districts are good to stay in where I feel like that is just wayy too general of a question. Like Tokyo‚Äôs wards are HUGE! I would rather someone suggest me more specifically a delightful neighborhood to stay at with a cool vibe rather than just looking through every accommodation in Shinjuku or Shibuya.

Yeah, my anger towards him may be too far off and twisted for people to see this but I totally loath him, hell when I saw his backstory when I finished Yuki's backstory...my heart and tears suddenly vanished and now filled with anger, resentment and spite


Sorry for the Rant, here Is Part 1 (The story Is too fking long to be put Into one post only üòÖ) 


When I was six years old, on the day I first appeared in social circles, I learned how my family was viewed by those around us.


""Oh my, isn't that the Suou family... They've returned to Japan, I see.""


""And the person behind them, is that their eldest son? This is the first time I've seen him...""


""Yes, it seems it's his first time in society today. If I recall correctly, his name was... Gensei Suou, was it? Still, it's remarkable how neither of the parents seem to show any concern for their young child. It's as one would expect from them, I suppose...""


""The eldest son himself doesn't seem to be bothered by it at all... You could say he appears calm, but there's hardly any childlike behavior... After all, that family is...""


An exceptionally talented but cold-blooded family that was how the Suou family was perceived in society. And my father, the head of the Suou family, perfectly embodied that reputation.


""The Suou family has protected and supported the country for over 800 years. As children born into the main house, you are public figures from birth. Always be conscious that your existence is for the public good, and never, ever think of pursuing personal interests.""


My father was always flawless, carrying the pride and responsibility of being the head of a prestigious family with not a single misstep. Naturally, he expected the same from me and my younger brother.


""Gensei, you forgot Lord Inoue's name earlier, didn't you? In social circles, it is basic etiquette to remember the faces, names, family businesses, and recent happenings of all attendees. Forgetting a name is inexcusable. Make sure this never happens again.""


My mother, who followed my father closely, was also highly competent in social settings but cold toward the family. Not once, since I was born, did I feel any parental affection from my parents. Yet, I never found myself dissatisfied or questioned this fact.


Though they weren't particularly kind, my parents were honorable people worthy of respect and always said nothing but the right things. I respected them, and I took pride in meeting their expectations. It seems my younger brother, who is two years younger, didn't feel the same way.


""Brother, aren't you struggling?""


""With what?""


""I mean, Father and Mother are always lecturing us but it seems like everyone else in class plays or goes shopping with their parents.""


""That's how normal families are, right? We're the Suou family, so it doesn't matter. Also, stop talking in such a weak and pathetic way.""


My brother was an excellent person, not disgracing the Suou name, but he was undeniably a soft-hearted man. He had a weak will, was timid, and always seemed to be looking for approval from me or our parents. His attitud irritated and disgusted me as someone who, despite being born the eldest son of the Suou family, was only ordinary.


If he hated being lectured so much, why didn't he make an effort to avoid it? Unlike talentless me, if my brother wanted to, he could easily meet our parents' expectations. How could he complain about our parents when it was clearly due to his own lack of effort?


Perhaps my brother had inherited the brilliance of the Suou family, while I had inherited its cold-heartedness. Our parents were perfect as members of the Suou family, but they were not fortunate with their heirs.


""Whoever expands their connections at Seirei Academy and manages to join the Raikoukai will be chosen as the successor.""


So, it was only natural that Father set such conditions to decide the successor of the Suou family. Most likely Father had seen through both my brother and me and even considered the possibility of selecting a successor from a branch family.


""Do you think Father hates us?""


Around this time, my brother started to express his anxiety and dissatisfaction more often. Perhaps it was his way of seeking comfort from his older brother. But still, I couldn't empathize with him, and his whining about such trivial matters only filled me with disgust.


""Like or dislike doesn't matter. As the head of the Suou family, it's only natural to choose the most suitable successor for the position. If you don't want to be disliked, why don't you try making an effort to live up to our parents' expectations?""


As I continued to treat him coldly and distance myself, my younger brother eventually stopped telling me anything. He became more and more rebellious towards our parents, repeatedly running away from home. However, I dismissed it as just a phase of adolescence and focused solely on my studies without paying much attention to him. Unlike my brother, who was exceptional, I was quite ordinary. Keeping up with the lessons at Seirei Academy, let alone studying to become a diplomat, was a constant struggle for me.


Yet, despite being inferior to my brother in every aspect, I did possess one exceptional ability.


It was the ability to recognize talent in others. By looking at a person's face and expressions, I could discern their intellectual aptitude. By observing their movements, I could gauge their physical capabilities. And by speaking with them, I could immediately tell if they were trustworthy. When I interacted closely with someone, I could even identify their talents and determine where they could excel the most.


Thanks to this one unique skill, it was easy for me to gain allies at the academy. I gave promising individuals opportunities to shine, regardless of their family background or gender, and brought down incompetent people who wielded unnecessary influence. Since I was a mediocre person born into a prestigious family, I didn't discriminate based on family background, and it seemed that this approach worked well.


""Who I am now is thanks to you, Suou-san!""


""You were the one who noticed me when no one else did, Suou-san. I'll follow you wherever you go.""


""Suou-san, you are my greatest benefactor. Just call on me anytime, and I will prioritize you above all else.""


Before I knew it, talented individuals who admired me gathered around. With their support, even though I was not particularly talented myself, I was able to join the Raikou Association right after graduating from high school.


""You've done well, Gensei. As the eldest son of the Suou family, you've achieved results worthy of our name. I will officially recognize you as my successor.""


""Your mother is proud of you. You've grown into such an admirable person. Please continue to live up to our expectations.""


It was probably the first time my strict parents praised me so openly. I was overjoyed and proud to have been acknowledged by them. As part of securing my position as the head of the Suou family, I entered university and continued my studies to become a diplomat, while also expanding my network. I forged ties with even more talented individuals, made occasional investments, and increased my influence within the Raikou Association. At the same time, I sought a suitable partner who could be the wife of a diplomat.


I was looking for a new partner and had even gone on a few arranged meetings introduced by my parents. At that time, I thought everything was going smoothly, except for my younger brother, who had practically stopped coming home... Until an infectious disease spread in the country where my father was working.


One day, late at night, I received an international call from my father. He told me that my mother had contracted the disease and was in critical condition, unconscious. He also revealed that he himself had caught the same illness. In my shock and confusion, I was on the verge of panic, but my father scolded me over the phone.


""Get a hold of yourself, Gensei! Nothing will change if you lose your composure! It's meaningless! What you need to do now is fulfill your role as a member of the Suou family!""


It felt as though I had been struck by lightning. Gasping for breath, I regained my composure, and my father gave me all the instructions he could. Then, saying he still needed to inform his colleagues and subordinates, he hung up. Even though my mother was on the brink of death and his own life was in danger, my father remained unwavering in his duty as a public figure.


""When I die, I entrust the Suou family to you, Gensei.""


Those were the last words I ever heard from my father. Just a few hours later, his condition suddenly worsened, and he passed away in a foreign land, almost simultaneously with my mother.


Upon hearing the news of our parent's deaths, my younger brother broke down in tears. However, I did not cry.


""Get a hold of yourself, Gensei! Nothing will change if you lose your composure! It's meaningless!""


My father's words, spoken while maintaining his dignity as a Suou until the very end, stayed with me. If he had been there, he would surely have scolded me, telling me not to cry and to fulfill my duties as a member of the Suo family. And so, I did not cry. I simply carried out what needed to be done as the new head of the Suo family.


Even with my father's instructions before his death, I endured an incredibly hectic period for a while. Given the nature of their deaths, bringing my parents' bodies back to Japan was extremely difficult. Still, I somehow managed to complete the funeral, and after a long time, I spoke to my brother.


""I'll handle the responsibilities as the head of the family, but there are some things I can't manage alone. I need your cooperation with those.""


However, my brother frowned and replied, ""No way.""


""What?""


""I said no. Why do I have to help you?""


My younger brother, who had completely changed his attitude over the past few years, spat these words out with a harsh tone. A bit surprised by his unexpected defiance, I remained calm as I replied.


""...Even though you're not the head of the family, you're still a Suou. Now that our parents are gone, don't you feel any obligation to do what you can for the family?""


""Because I'm a Suou? Work for the sake of the family? I don't care about that! That's just your logic!""


Stunned by his outburst, my brother continued to unleash all the pent-up frustration he'd been holding in for years.


""I'm sick of it! The house, you, all of it! Even when our father was on his deathbed, he couldn't be bothered to leave me a single word. I wasn't expecting any parental affection at this point... but seriously, what a terrible parent! And yet, no matter how awful they were, a parent is still a parent! Of course, it hurts when your parents die! Of course, you'd cry! But you! You didn't shed a single tear at the funeral! All you talk about is the family, the family... Do you even have a heart?""


Faced with his yelling, I found myself unable to respond. He glared at me sharply, then turned on his heel.


""If you'd just said something to comfort me when I was crying, maybe I would have helped. But it doesn't matter anymore. I'm leaving. I don't need the inheritance. You can do whatever you want with it.""


With those words, he left the mansion. I couldn't find the words to say to him, and all I could do was watch him walk away.


After my brother left, I was left alone, buried in the duties of managing the family. However, his parting words never left my mind.


""Do you even have a heart?""


Perhaps... I really don't have one. Now that I think about it, I've never once been kind to him. I respected my parents, but if someone asked whether I loved them, I couldn't say for sure.


No, I probably didn't love them at all. If I had truly loved them, like my brother said, I would have shed at least one tear at the funeral.


Is it true, Suou-san, that you've rejected all your marriage candidates?""


After finishing a phase of work, I reunited with my college friends at our regular cafe, and that's when I was asked the question.


""...Yeah.""


""What!? Why would you do that, it's such a waste! Weren't you with the top genius of the university, Miss Aozaka?""


**""I even the daughter of the Kujou family was there! You turned them all down!?""**


So Akemi was once a candidate for the Shou Family (THANK GOD HE ISN'T AS COLD AS HIS PARENT, I COULD NOT IMAGINE THIS BS OF A RELATIONSHIP) 


""Yeah.""


When I gave a short confirmation, my friends shouted in disbelief, ""No way!""


It's true, their backgrounds were impeccable, and they had the education and ambition to be ideal wives for a diplomat.


But... for me, no matter who I married among them, I could only see a future where our relationship would be just like my parents'. Until now, I thought that would be fine. However...


(What if the child we had together turned out to be like my younger brother? Could I stand by and just watch as they leave, without offering them the love or kindness they need?)


Once I had those thoughts, I couldn't imagine marrying any of them.


What I really needed in a wife wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t status or intelligence, but rather...


""Okay~ Sorry to keep you waiting! Three hot coffees and one espresso~""


One of my friends raised an eyebrow at the waitress who brought the drinks.


""Oh, hey? Is she new?""


""Yes, I started working here last week. Nice to meet you~!""


Upon second glance, she was not just plain, but almost dull. Yet... I couldn't take my eyes off her.


At first, I thought maybe it was because I was so used to being surrounded by exceptional people that I found her type to be refreshing. However, for some reason, I continued to be intrigued by her, and soon enough, I found myself frequently visiting the cafe, even on my own.


""Oh, Suou-san. You're here again today~""


""Yes""


Although we had become acquaintances and occasionally engaged in small talk when there were few customers, my impression of her never changed.


""And so, it's said that connections with developing countries in that region are going to become increasingly important.""


Oh, is that so~?""


""Are you really understanding this?""

""Umm~ well, I kind of get that it sounds tough?""

She was a woman who wasn't quick-witted, lacking in both knowledge and education. But she was always smiling, and despite my conversations likely being boring to her, she earnestly listened. She was kind and considerate to everyone, never speaking ill of others or voicing any complaints.

""Suou, that's love.""

""Kijima What are you talking about?""

""Well, you're interested in that shop clerk, right? You visit her whenever you have time, don't you? And without realizing it, you're constantly watching her, right? That's love, Suou.""

It was a fast paced relationship, in which we moved in together after about 2 months of dating. It was very common for him to go to his hometown on the weekends (hometown was 30-45mins away) to see his family, hometown friends, and work on a hobby car.  I didn't go with him when he went back home, instead I used my weekends to catch up with friends over coffee or meals, or just spend time to myself reading or doing whatever I want. Over Valentine's Day, he decided to take the day off and go home to see his mom and would be home after I got home from work. Usually when we text, it's like, ""hey, how's your day going"", ""was thinking about you, what are you doing"" or something similar, but I didn't get a single text from him other than, ""I'm leaving the house now"" and ""I made it to my parent's house"". I wasn't going to pester him while he was visiting family, so I left it alone. When I got home, I noticed he wasn't back yet, so I made myself dinner and just watched some tv. He showed up roughly an hour later and apologized for being late. He took his shoes off and immediately went upstairs to take a quick shower before coming downstairs to relax and watch tv with me. I felt awkward bringing up Valentine's Day, so neither of us said anything and went to bed like a normal night.

2 months later, boyfriend has mentioned he will be going out of town for 1 week on a work trip. The day of travel came up, I took him to the airport, we kissed goodbye, and I waited for the ""I made it to my destination"" - but never got it. Rather the next morning, he said good morning and he missed me already. On day 3 of boyfriend being away, I was going through my emails and saw an email notification from TUMBLR that I had a message. I haven't used Tumblr in a long time but was curious as to what this could be. It was an anonymous message that said,

""OP, I am sorry to have to reach out to you this way but I don't want you to continue living in this lie. Your cute dates and butterfly feelings with BOYFRIEND are not only yours. He has done those things with me. To imagine he takes you on the same dates as he has taken me, told you the same lines he told me, shown your around HOMETOWN the way he has shown me, hurts my heart. I don't think it is wrong of me to reach out to the other woman, and I hope you understand why I am reaching out to you"".

I was super confused by this message and at first thought it was a troll message, but it stuck with me. I didn't tell Boyfriend about this message, I just kind of blew it off, but it also kept eating at me. When he came back from his work trip, he seemed overly happy to see me and we spent all day together catching up and me asking about his trip. I did notice he would look at his phone frequently and place it screen down when he wasn't on it. That night, I couldn't sleep. I tossed and turned and could not go to sleep. I kept thinking about that anonymous message so I got out of bed, tiptoed to the other side of the bed, and quietly took his phone off the charger. I went to the bathroom and locked myself inside. His phone did not have a password lock on it, so it wasn't difficult getting in to it. I went straight to the text messages and saw the last text coming from his co-worker ""Cindy"". The last message read, ""Do you miss the way my mouth feels around your cock?"" I was so extremely shocked. I started scrolling back through their text thread to see more and more horrific messages. She had been sending thirst trap pictures of herself and saw constant ""sexts"" between them and the text that stopped me in my tracks was the message from Valentine's Day.

Cindy: ""Thank you so much for taking me to your Hometown. I had the best day with you""  
Boyfriend: ""I'm glad you enjoyed the day, Valentine""

I then made the mistake of going to his photos app. There were photos and videos of their sexual acts that span over 4 months. That is where I stopped looking. I put his phone down and quietly cried in the bathroom for the next 10 mins. After I collected myself, I put his phone back on the charger and crawled back into bed. The next morning I woke up, texted my best friend to meet for coffee and left the house. I told her everything and together we devised a plan to help me break up with boyfriend and move out. When I got home that afternoon, I found my boyfriend was not home, and instead he left a note saying, ""Sweetheart, going home for the weekend! I'll see you on Sunday! Think of me while I'm gone""

I called 2 of my best friends, they came over with a U-Haul truck and they helped me pack up all of my things and they let me move in with them temporarily. I texted my boyfriend and told him we needed to talk and asked if he could call me. About 15 mins later, he called, and I quickly said, ""I don't think our relationship is going to work out and I think we should break up"". He started asking questions and became quickly reassuring. I told him I was already moved out of our apartment and that we could talk in person when he returns on Sunday. He immediately got angry and told me I was irrational. He also told me I needed to go to therapy because I'm clearly bipolar and emotionally unstable but he would be there to help me through it. I told him there was nothing wrong with me and that I was firm in breaking up with him. 

So, am I the asshole for going through my boyfriend's phone and then quickly moving out of our apartment rather than confronting him about the messages and photos?",0,1729024071.0,AITAH,3,0.4,False

TLDR; did she cheat on me? What do i even do from here?

Reposted for spelling and additional information.

Me (26M) and my ex (24F) broke up a little more than 3 months ago. We met her freshman year of college and my junior year, eventually we moved in together after i graduated with my masters while she was still going to school, so we lived together for a little under 3 years. 

She was the only girl that i have ever dated that i knew i wanted to spend my entire life with even from the start and even when there was bad moments (we never really had these, we never argued or yelled at each other, even at the very end, we were both very mature people, atleast that‚Äôs how it was.). We were also both very communicative i thought, until maybe towards the end. I had a pretty good relationship with her family and we had a cat together. From my understanding she broke up with me after falling out of love with me, those were her words when i gave her all i could. 

When we moved in i sacrificed a lot to be with her, i grew up almost 300 miles away and did not have any family or really many friends from college that were around in the area that we stayed in. We had just moved into a new apartment a month and a half before the breakup and she told me she started to feel like breaking up with me shortly after we moved in there. 

The thing that triggers me is she started working at a new job around this time as well, she met new friends from there and my sweet girl turned into someone that always wanted to go out with them. I have a career where i make an above average salary but have a large amount of student debt so work was important as i had bills to pay and i was not able to hang out with her and her new friends really ever because they wanted to hangout usually later at night when she knew i had to be up early in the morning. She also went back to school after completeing a degree as she did not want to do anything with it so she wanted to try something else out. I feel like she did not understand my work commitments as all she had to worry about was online school and her part time job at a restaurant, which i know is still a lot but we were just in two different places. She also during our entire time was not a drinker, or really even liked going to parties. I was the wild kid in college before i met her and she completely changed me for the better. Stopped taking drugs and drinking to blackout every night with my college teammates, my grades also improved enough to where i was able go to grad school. I was never really fawn of these new friends as some of the things she told me were a bit suspect and not really the type of people that she normally hangs out withbut i trusted her. I always gave her all my trust even when she would go out. I did catch her snap chatting a coworker that she had no interest in (he wasn‚Äôt her type) and i mentioned to her that i was really okay with it but i trust her. Later after the breakup i brought this up and she told me that he creeped her out and no longer works with her because she told him that, idk what happened there but it doesn‚Äôt feel right. Also two days before we broke up she said she was meeting with a guy friend for coffee after work, i said okay be safe and let me know when your are coming home. This sounds like cheating right?

I suspect there was cheating but she reaffirmed me many times that she didn‚Äôt and she did not want to be with anyone after us as she needs to fix herself. She knew she had ‚Äúundiagnosed‚Äù OCD and she would often have moments where OCD would absolutely floor her, i almost did my best to comfort her during these times. I really just don‚Äôt know what happened and what i did. She would give me no other reason as to why we needed to end things. What upsets me is that probably only a month before this she told me that she would never break up with me and i would be the one breaking up with her.

Towards the end she got really mean to me. Always trying to start arguments and never giving me anything that would make me feel like she loved me. There was no intimacy the last month or so as well, but she was never an intimate person. For the last two years it was never enough personally for me and she knew that but i never complained because i know she was going through a lot, with undiagnosed mental issues. I just put up with everything because i cared for her like no one person ever in my life and it didn‚Äôt bother me enough to try and change her. I understood.

Back to the break up, she broke up with me on a random Thursday, oddly enough that morning i got in the shower for work and could just feel my intuition telling me this was happening today, i had never felt that the entire relationship. One thing i will say is that a month prior to the breakup as well i asked for a simple hug and she wouldn‚Äôt give it to me, i went on a walk and returned the apartment and told her how i had felt about how she was treating me and that way and she acknowledged it, not much changed obviously before it was over. If anything it only got worse.

After the breakup i stayed in the apartment we lived in for 2 months looking for jobs to move back home with my parents, we talked most days but it was hard and i feel like i made things worse as i was honestly so depressed. I was alone in an apartment doing nothing but working, applying for jobs, and sleeping. This was the worst 2 months of my entire life.

Eventually i was able to move home with a new higher paying job but the way things ended hurt even more. Two days before i left we had a talk where i wanted more closure, which i really didn‚Äôt get many answers aside from the whole i still love you, but i fell out of love with you, and i didn‚Äôt cheat on you, she also admitted that her parents were really upset with the break up. The night i was supposed to leave we agreed to say our goodbyes, she completely blew me off. Saying she couldn‚Äôt do it and she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable seeing me to say goodbye. That‚Äôs what hurt the most, i was ready to let go and respect her decision until she couldn‚Äôt even come face to face with me and say one last goodbye and goodluck.

 Moving home and starting my new job has been tough but I‚Äôm slowly adapting to things here. I was strong on no contact aside from the first week as rent was charged to my bank account do the apartment manager (yes the apartment is still partially in my name, i worked things out with her and her dad to pay my side and promised that if i need to step in to help just let me know) messing up the auto pay where i had to contact her, she was rude to me but nothing to terrible. 

Our five year anniversary would‚Äôve been this past Sunday, i did text her the Friday before as something in my brain just finally caved in to check up on her, which went okay. Not much was shared and i just wanted to make sure her and the cat were okay. I did ask her about a thing on tv that we would watch together all the time where i got a very dry respond and just did not text back as it was not worth it anymore.

I‚Äôve moved to blocking her on all social media as i would try and check in on things every few days (yes i know this is terrible, but doing this is going to help me move in the right direction.). This is more of a decision to help me get over things, i have no hate towards her.

Life is just really hard right now for me, i never thought i would be in this position as we had so many plans and i gave her genuine and as much unconditional love that i could possible give her. In the end, i think she just got bored with me as i was her first for everything. 

I really just don‚Äôt know what to do now, she‚Äôs all i can think about and i see her everywhere. She‚Äôs in my dreams that wake me up every morning at 4am and it‚Äôs really starting to take a toll on me, even though i genuinely think i am getting better. Just really slowly. I know i was not appreciated, even during the relationship but i just thought this was a down period for us, which i felt never really happened before.

Over the last month and a half that i have been back home i have been spending as much time as possible with friends and family, with the weather getting colder in the midwest it‚Äôs going to be a lot tougher to stay happy and busy the coming months. I‚Äôve gotten back into some old hobbies, been treating myself, and trying to take better care of myself physically and mentally. I did lose almost 25 pounds during those two months that i was alone and i am a relatively scrawny guy as it is.

What advise do you have to give me? Is there any chance to get back together here? Would you even take her back if that was an option down the road? How badly did i mess up texting her the other day when i texted her with genuinely good intentions? What even happened her from my perspective? I know i need to just finally leave her alone which is the plan. But i just don‚Äôt know what i need to do to take the next step. I lost a lot here and all my plans and goals revolved around her and us, she also knew this i told her this multiple times as she was so worth all the sacrifices i made. This girl truly was one of the only things that made me happy in this life. It just sucks because the girl i fell in love with was a completely different person in the end.

* Ample offer of activities, sports groups, gyms, etc with people on our age group so we can make new friends.
* Somewhat safe area
* Green areas (such as the beach, hiking, etc) either on the neighborhood or nearby so we can enjoy them on the weekends
* 1 bedroom apt

Hope this helps!,"Long story short, I (IMG 5th year/US equivalent 3rd year) started studying for Step 1 in mid-late August and took the exam at the end of February. I got into a bit of details of how during the exam felt and after the exam.

My test scores were as follows: 

* Form 29 = 47 - September 30 
* Form 26 = 51 - Nov 15 
* Form 30 = 50 - Nov 26 
* UWSA1 = 55 - Jan 16 
* Form 31 = 62 - Jan 21 
* UWSA2 = 58 - Jan 31 
* Form 28 = 65 - Feb 11 
* Form 27 = 63 - Feb 18 
* Old Free 120 = 75 - Feb 22 
* New Free 120 = 64 - Feb 23 (on 4 hours of sleep, flight to exam location, and full day study) 
* Exam = PASS - Feb 26

My first exam date was 20smth of December and was postponed.

I had hospital rotations at the same time as my studying. Didn't have a purely dedicated period. Worked from 8am-2pm then would study from 4 or 5 pm till midnight.

UWorld: from early September till Early February. Would do 40 questions on the study subject of the day, and the next day study the same topic, but 40 questions mixed. If you didn't get jt just hit me up. I found it helpful.

Studied Boards and Beyond for Organ Systems and Genetics (would annotate FA): Mid August - Early Jan

Dirty Medicine Biochem: 1st pass August, 2nd pass December

Sketchy Micro: December

Ethics and related stuff on Youtube: December

Did Pathoma Chapters 1-3 twice: Mid November and Mid Jan

Randy Neil Biostats: Early Jan

Mehlman Review: Neuroanatomy, Neuro, HY arrows, Immuno (These 4 i felt were a must) and any topic i felt weak in Mid Jan - Mid Feb, side note: make sure you don't look at the NBME section of his notes if you haven't taken the tests, it will skew ur results)

3 days before exam: skimmed Mhelman, and went over the pdf where i documented all my Practice Test Mistakes, FA review

The exam felt like a combination of the Old and New Free 120. There were maybe a 10 super long questions. My technique was to read the last part of the question, i was able to answer several that way. If I couldn't then I read the question.

Exam strategy: Block 1 - Break - 2 - 3 - Break - 4 - Break - 5 - Break 6 - Break - 7 (Made sure I did the tutorial at home to gain 15 extra minutes of break time) Had 2 small sandwiches, 3 cereal bars, 1.5L bottle, a thermos with coffee (had 1 shot in each of the 1st 3 breaks)

I expected to get more tired than I had actually got.

Difficulty: 1 (easy, flagged 7), 2,3,4(moderate, flagged 11 each), 5 (moderate/tough, flagged 14), 6 (tough, flagged 17), 7 (moderate, flagged 10)

Midway through block 5, started thinking that it was easy and got a little overconfident, then it got tough... by the end of 6 I was convinced I failed and started panicking. Had to compose myself during the break and convince myself that if I did well in block 7 I'd be fine.

Post-exam: immediately after felt somewhat OK, 2 hours later, started stressing out. First few days made a few posts on here. Then went into hermit mode. Once a day or every other day, I'd go through waves of fear that maybe I failed. Closer to the results I started freaking out and started thinking that under flagged and I felt like I failed.

If you made it this far I just want to tell you to trust the process and trust the work you put in of you find yourself in a similar position. I had people try tell me to postpone it at the end but I felt confident that I could pass so I went ahead. If you need anything feel free to message me.

IMPORTANT EDIT 1: people asked me about Anki, I downloaded the latest anking deck, but I used it with the add-on that finds the cards based on your UWorld question mistakes

EDIT 2: had some questions on Embryology, I didn't focus too much on it while studying, I learned them through Uworld questions and made sure to review the wrong answers too. Then a few days out I redid all the questions again, it's like 40 of them. It was good refresh

EDIT 3: Some of you asked about my exam flagging method, I don't know if the following is accurate (considering there are trial questions), but I told myself that if I wanted to get at least a 65% on the exam to pass, then I was able to get 14 questions per block wrong....... So questions I had a tough time with, I would flag and put an answer quickly and move on. At the end of the block, if I would go over my flagged questions again and focus on the ones that maybe needed a bit more thinking. A few blocks I had more than 14 questions flagged, and I would try and get them to less than 14 flagged. (This method also helped me be good with time, was able to finish a few blocks with 5-10 min to spare so i could re check the flagged. I never went over non flagged because i have a history of changing correct answers)",1,1729023952.0,IMGreddit,0,1.0,False

I currently work at a school, i'm an Educational Assistant at this therapeutic school. I started working mid last year and there was these 2 students who are siblings who i built a connection with, all the other staff tended to hate on them and made it quite obvious to the kids that they were not very liked, I felt for these kids as all the kids in this school had a history of various violent home lives, abusive parents, some had disabilities and all sorts so working with these kids you can't help but just feel sorry for some of them and just try to give them extra support and guidance. One of the students gave me his mothers phone number, l reached out to her to just let her know that I saw her kids as actual kids, and not she's doing an amazing job and from there on the mother and I started talking regularly, by that time it was summer and the her kids have already been unenrolled at the school i work at and were registered for a different district. I met with the mother a few times and we had coffee and just talked, she became on of my friends. Now that the school year as started again, I told one of my coworkers about it all, but i did kind of lie and say she was a family friend and that's how i know her. This week l've been told i'm not allowed to come to work because there's an investigation on me because someone filed an OATIS complaint on me for being friends with that mom. I haven't heard from HR about anything yet other then i'm not allowed to go into work. I'm just curious am i actually allowed to be fired for this? Like what laws forbid Staff from being friends with a past students parent? I was talking to one of my best friends who works there with me and she thinks it's because the school has done a lot of illegal things, and not up to date on paperwork and since that specific mom has been filing complaints against the school the administration is scared i gave information to the mom about all that stuff when truthfully i haven't, and they have no proof that i do. but regardless are they legally allowed to fire me for that? especially considering they are not even students anymore.",1,1729023914.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

1g4hejo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintMeghanMarkle/comments/1g4hejo/no_friends/,No Friends,"I've been thinking about this for awhile. I think Meghan, almost as much as she wants fame, wants friends. However, the concept utterly eludes her. We've all see the birthday video when she commands the other girls to obey her. Even though she attended an all-girl school and was a member of a national sorority, she had no friends at her wedding. Although she certainly meets women, she cannot maintain friendships with them. She pretends famous stars are her bestie (Paltrow, Teigan, Amal, Oprah, Ellen, Sabrina, McPhee, Beyonce, etc.), but none of them seem to last beyond one or two encounters. She is never seen with other moms strolling around with kids, never seen shopping with anyone but paid assistants, never seen out having coffee with a group of girlfriends, or doing *anything that normal, adjusted women do with their women friends everyday around the world.*

I think she is, on some level, profoundly lonely but is incapable of understanding her role in her own loneliness. Her creepy, constant clutching and grabbing other women is her only way to show connection with them. She only understands physical linking, not emotional linking. With men she can do that in a sexual manner, but it's not as effective with women. Maybe the absence of a mother has damaged her. Maybe it's a personality disorder. Maybe she's just self-centered, or angry, or envious, insecure, stupid, competitive? Who knows? When she announced that her Netflix cooking show would be about food, lifestyle, and friendship, we all laughed because we knew she had no friends. But, as awful as she is, I do see her constant grabbing at hands to be similar to someone drowning and grasping for a buoy. As I usually do, I will end this musing with a final thought about the children. We learn so much about behavior and relationships from our parents. When we see them having a healthy relationship with their spouse, family, co-workers, and friends we learn how to have that for ourselves. I worry about Arch and Lil. Having good nannies is just not the same, and I really hope they are just figments and not real vulnerable, innocent, feeling little people.

1g4hebi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1g4hebi/my_ex_said_hi_to_me/,My ex said hi to me,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm looking for a bit of advice or anything really. Beware, I‚Äôm very stupid about this situation and it‚Äôs quite sad to see I can‚Äôt move on after so much time. 

I‚Äôve made a post about the severe anxiety I get from seeing my ex in college, as I do have to see him two days a week, from morning to night, and until may of next year. I can‚Äôt change my schedule nor can I skip classes, so I‚Äôm really stuck, and his classroom is right next to mine. So I‚Äôm two feet away from him all day. I figured I would deal with the anxiety without much advice, because I don‚Äôt know what people can tell me. If it continues like this or even gets worse, I‚Äôll simply go to therapy again. 

My ex broke up with me a year ago, and I‚Äôm ashamed to say but I still care. It‚Äôs different now, I feel like we are estranged, but I‚Äôm still hurt and a part of me is still hoping for something. I constantly fight against that hope, and I‚Äôm realizing the work isn‚Äôt finished.

Anyways, about three weeks ago, I was waiting for a coffee in the corridor when I saw him. I quickly turned my head away, as an instinct, and I could see he was starting to approach me physically. I think he realized I wasn‚Äôt too eager to face him, so he backed away. When I looked back, he had a big smile and said hi. I did respond politely, but I was taken aback as it had been 10 months since I last spoke to him. 

After that, I kept avoiding him to be very honest, by making sure not to look around me when I was going about in the school. I did meet his eyes maybe twice, and looked away immediately. Yet again, I just didn‚Äôt know how to behave in the moment, and even though it was a bit immature I just don‚Äôt know how to handle it. He was my first and only relationship, I was deeply hurt for months, and I think I did care way more than he did. I mean the facts just tell me that.

Moreover, his friends, as well as his new classmates he‚Äôs just met, all tend to stare at me as if I were a topic of conversation, and that makes me feel even more embarrassed. I feel like he talks about me, but I can‚Äôt figure out why and maybe I‚Äôm just too self involved and paranoid.

Anyways, I keep thinking about the fact he did say hi to me, and the fact I‚Äôve ignored him ever since. A part of me thinks that he may have wanted to talk, that he wouldn‚Äôt reject me if I initiated a conversation, but the logical immediate interpretation I‚Äôve made, and that I need to make, is that he was being polite.

I can‚Äôt shake it. I wish I could text him, but I did during summer and he apologized then, but he also said he had moved on. I know he‚Äôs not in an actual relationship, but still. I just wish he would have insisted, said something, but that‚Äôs not reasonable either.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just time to move on and forget about it completely, even though it hurts. Today I saw him again, made sure not to look, and I started shaking and cried in the bathroom. I‚Äôm really upset about the state I‚Äôm putting myself in for this, and I clearly don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.",2,1729023735.0,ExNoContact,0,0.75,False

As 65% of doctors who transitioned to coworking spaces have reported operational cost reductions by up to 30%, it's clear that adapting to modern demands isn't just beneficial‚Äîit's essential. Imagine stepping into an office where you share high-tech reception areas while maintaining private consultation rooms, ensuring both community and confidentiality. This shift is not merely a trend but a strategic evolution designed to meet complex healthcare requirements efficiently and affordably.

A medical coworking space is a shared office environment specifically designed for healthcare professionals, providing the necessary resources and amenities to operate efficiently while reducing overhead costs. These spaces offer flexible leasing options, modern facilities, and opportunities for networking among medical practitioners, allowing for a more adaptable and cost-effective approach to managing a medical practice.

**Concept Behind Medical Coworking Spaces**

[Medical coworking spaces](https://www.residen.com/)¬†represent a shift in how healthcare practitioners approach their work environment. At their core, these spaces provide a collaborative setting that merges functionality with community, allowing professionals to share resources while also maintaining their autonomy. Picture a space where physicians can access advanced medical equipment without the heavy burden of overhead costs associated with traditional private practices. This innovative model enhances efficiency and dramatically reduces the expenses related to running an independent practice.

The pivotal component of medical coworking is the balance between shared facilities and individualized care. Practitioners utilize common areas‚Äîsuch as reception desks, waiting rooms, and workspaces‚Äîwhile enjoying the privacy of their own consultation rooms. This arrangement fosters practical advantages and cultivates a community-driven atmosphere where medical professionals can support one another. Imagine hearing laughter down the hall as doctors exchange ideas or share advice over coffee; it's this synergy that creates a vibrant workspace unlike any other.

Moving beyond just sharing space and resources, medical coworking encourages collaboration and innovation as practitioners come together with different specialties.

Additionally, medical coworking spaces often host networking opportunities, workshops, and seminars that allow healthcare providers from diverse disciplines to share knowledge and experiences. This interdisciplinary approach can lead to improved patient outcomes by promoting collaboration across various fields of expertise. For instance, a cardiologist might engage with a nutritionist on weight management strategies, or a physical therapist may consult with orthopedic practices on rehabilitation techniques.

In this flexible environment, the ability to pivot in response to changing patient needs or market conditions becomes more manageable. Physicians can book office space on demand and tailor their practice operations according to fluctuations in patient flow without being tied down by long-term leases or excessive overhead.

As we further explore these dynamic environments, it‚Äôs essential to understand how they meet operational needs while also aligning with modern patient expectations.

[Research shows that patients increasingly prefer practices that prioritize convenience and accessibility](https://www.repugen.com/blog/what-impacts-patient-experience-in-healthcare#:~:text=Patients%20prioritize%20convenience%20and%20accessibility,influencing%20their%20decision%2Dmaking%20process.)‚Äîvalues built into the very fabric of coworking models. With streamlined check-in processes, shared equipment, and cohesive administrative support, medical coworking spaces make it easier for healthcare providers to focus entirely on what matters most: delivering exceptional patient care.

Understanding these foundational elements paves the way for appreciating the transformative changes that are occurring in healthcare delivery today. As we look further into these advancements, we will discover how they reshape traditional practices to better serve both providers and patients alike.

**Evolution of Healthcare Practices**

In the past, healthcare was often rigidly structured, with doctors working from standalone offices or within hospital walls, which offered little flexibility. However, as our world has rapidly evolved, so too have patient needs and the technological landscape. Today, we can see healthcare becoming more adaptable and patient-centric.

One key catalyst for this change has been the rise of telehealth‚Äîan innovative approach that allows patients to connect with their healthcare providers remotely.¬†[According to a report by McKinsey, telehealth usage skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing by an astounding 154%](https://psico-smart.com/en/blogs/blog-the-role-of-telehealth-in-enhancing-wellness-monitoring-systems-172029). This surge provided a clear indication that patients were ready to embrace new modes of healthcare delivery. It also highlighted an urgent need for medical spaces that could accommodate both traditional face-to-face consultations and modern telehealth services seamlessly.

As practitioners began to adapt to this hybrid model, many found that they required flexible office solutions. They needed spaces that could facilitate immediate care while also providing technology-driven capabilities for virtual consultations. This has led to medical cohorts actively seeking coworking environments tailored specifically for their profession. These collaborative spaces not only reduce overhead costs but also foster an atmosphere conducive to networking and sharing resources‚Äîfurther enhancing the adaptability of their practice.

>

Another factor influencing this evolution is shifting patient expectations. Modern patients seek convenience and accessibility alongside quality care‚Äîthey desire the ability to schedule appointments that fit into their busy lives. Therefore, medical professionals who embrace these evolving dynamics can differentiate themselves in a competitive market by offering flexibility and responsiveness to patient needs.

Understanding this evolution highlights how dynamic office solutions can address today‚Äôs challenges and empower healthcare providers to thrive in an ever-changing landscape.

**Cost-Effective Operations**

Traditional medical offices weigh heavily on overhead costs like rents, utilities, staff salaries, and maintenance, which can significantly drain your resources. With the average expense in a conventional setting rising above $10,000 monthly, many healthcare practitioners find themselves squeezed. This leaves little room for investment in patient care or necessary technological improvements.

*In contrast*, medical coworking spaces offer an elegant solution by distributing these costs across multiple practices, transforming this landscape into something more sustainable and financially wise.

**Financial Savings**

|Expense Type|Traditional Office|Medical Coworking|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rent|$4,000/month|$1,500/month|
|Utilities|$1,000/month|$300/month|
|Staff Salaries|$5,000/month|$2,000/month|
|Maintenance|$500/month|$100/month|
|**Total**|**$10,500/month**|**$3,900/month**|

The figures clearly highlight substantial potential savings. A practitioner could save over $6,600 each month by opting for coworking spaces‚Äîa remarkable difference that allows for reinvestment into vital areas. This could mean hiring additional nursing staff to improve patient interactions or upgrading technology to enhance telehealth capabilities.

Additionally, these coworking environments often encompass shared facilities and resources like waiting rooms, reception desks, and even specialized treatment areas or equipment. This not only eliminates the stress of hefty initial investments but also encourages collaboration among peers in similar specialties.

By leveraging these shared operational costs, medical professionals can maintain a high-quality practice while fostering innovative community interactions within their field. Understanding the available configurations of these office solutions is crucial for making informed decisions moving forward.

**Types of Medical Coworking Facilities**

Medical coworking facilities encompass a broad spectrum, from simple shared office environments to sophisticated clinics tailored for healthcare providers. When thinking about these spaces, it's helpful to visualize how each type serves different needs within the medical community. Each option offers unique advantages that cater to varying levels of practice complexity and technological requirements, making it essential to choose wisely.

# Categories of Facilities

1. **Basic Shared Offices**: These spaces are designed with minimal amenities but still provide essential office infrastructure like desks, internet access, and basic waiting areas. They're suitable for practitioners focusing on telehealth or those who do not require heavy equipment. Imagine a doctor conducting virtual consultations‚Äîhaving a calm and professional environment for video calls is all they truly need. These setups often allow flexibility and lower costs, ideal for those just starting their practice.
2. **Integrated Clinics**: Moving up the ladder, integrated clinics offer an array of comprehensive facilities that may include examination rooms, lab spaces, and even minor surgical suites. These clinics cater to healthcare professionals who need more than just an office space. Consider a pediatrician requiring rooms specifically designed for child-friendly examinations; this type of facility allows them to cater directly to their patients' needs while maintaining an optimal workflow.
3. **Specialized Coworking Spaces**: The most refined options are tailored to specific medical fields such as dermatology or gynecology. These spaces are outfitted with field-specific equipment that can enhance patient care and streamline operations. For instance, a dermatology workspace might have specialized lighting, treatment chairs, and storage for dermatological supplies‚Äîall in one location. This not only makes the work process efficient but also provides an inviting atmosphere for patients receiving treatments.

Companies like **Residen** are noteworthy examples in this landscape as they specialize in high-end, fully equipped [coworking medical office spaces for rent ](https://www.residen.com/)that cater to a multitude of medical specialties. Their facilities incorporate modern design elements alongside cutting-edge technology to ensure that healthcare professionals can deliver top-tier care.

Having explored the various types of medical coworking facilities, you can now evaluate which options best suit your specific practice needs and ambitions. Let's consider what factors should influence your decision when searching for an appropriate setting.

# Selecting the Ideal Space for Your Practice

The journey to finding the perfect coworking space can be likened to navigating a maze, where each turn reveals new insights and considerations. Before diving into any specific location, reflecting on your practice's distinct requirements is essential. Think about what will assist you in providing uninterrupted care to your patients while also ensuring your own efficiency as a healthcare provider.

**Evaluation Criteria**

When assessing potential spaces, a well-defined set of criteria can help streamline your decision-making process.¬†**Location**¬†stands out as a key factor. A central position not only enhances your visibility but also ensures accessibility for your patients and staff. A prime location can significantly reduce patient no-show rates, making it easier for those juggling busy schedules to reach you without hassle.

Next up is¬†**facilities**. It‚Äôs crucial to ensure that the coworking space comes equipped with the medical equipment and support amenities you need. This might include access to examination rooms, imaging technology, or office supplies necessary for efficient operations. Some spaces even provide options for specialized treatment areas that align with your practice‚Äôs focus. Imagine walking into a beautifully designed office that has everything you need right there‚Äîthis environment not only boosts productivity but also enhances patient satisfaction.

Cost considerations come next; however, it‚Äôs not just about the initial rental fee. Often, there are hidden costs like utilities and maintenance fees that can sneak up on you later. Careful budgeting must take these into account to prevent financial strain down the line. Always probe deeper: ask about any additional charges that may arise from using communal services or equipment.

Finally,¬†**flexibility**¬†should be high on your list of priorities. As your practice evolves, the ability to scale operations up or down according to demand is crucial. For example, if you're anticipating growth due to seasonal fluctuations or expanded patient outreach efforts, ensure the lease terms allow for easy adjustments without hefty penalties.

I‚Äôve noticed that the combination of Kanna with psychedelics is not very well documented and many reports are contradictory to others or don‚Äôt have much info about dosage or timing. From my research I‚Äôve seen people say that Kanna has amplified their trip (mostly body high, mood and visuals) and others have said it has dulled or even fully killed trips.

For this trip I‚Äôm taking 25mg of 4-ACO-DMT orally and a moderately dosed (for me) THC edible 30 minutes later on an empty stomach. After the peak I‚Äôll be insufflating 25mg of a 5% Kanna extract.


THE TRIP

8:00pm - Had a cup of coffee before tonight‚Äôs trip, hopped in a discord call with some friends to play some games.

8:30pm - Ate 5 4-AcO-DMT gummies (5mg each).

9:00pm - Ate THC gummy (blend of THC-A THC-P and D9 for those that are curious). Starting to feel the 4-AcO-DMT a bit.

9:37pm - Huuuge burst of energy, attention span is still alright and visuals starting. Not feeling the THC fully yet.

10:04pm - Pretty smooth come-up, music is fantastic. Getting wavy visuals, colors are brighter and there‚Äôs some patterns in the walls. I‚Äôm still fairly clear-headed. Everything is hilarious.

10:40pm - Insufflated 25mg of Kanna extract. Still feeling great.

10:53pm - Visuals are noticeably more intense. Stupid amount of energy, feeling warmth in my whole body. Head high is not anymore intense right now. My walls look like they have veins in them it‚Äôs pretty fucking dope lmao.

11:04pm - As the rush is fading I feel super relaxed and connected with everything. Visuals staying strong, anything I stare at for long turns into smooth spinning fractals. Overall feeling fantastic.

CONCLUSION

Ended up having a really great trip. I didn‚Äôt end up feeling like Kanna killed my headspace at all but it wasn‚Äôt too intense in the first place. The rush felt synergistic with the visuals being slightly amped up but I‚Äôd like to try this again on a higher dose of psychedelics at some point.

I‚Äôm 31, and lately, I feel like I‚Äôm living someone else‚Äôs life. I‚Äôve been married to Sarah for six years, and we have a five-year-old daughter, Emily. From the outside, things should be good. We‚Äôve got the house, the kid, the jobs. It looks like the kind of life people work toward. But inside, everything feels... off.

It wasn‚Äôt always like this. There was a time when I‚Äôd look at Sarah and feel lucky‚Äîlike I‚Äôd found someone who got me, who made me feel alive. We used to talk for hours about anything and everything. We used to laugh‚ÄîGod, we laughed a lot. Now, most days, we barely say more than a few words to each other.

Our house is quiet, too quiet. Not because of Emily‚Äîshe fills the place with her energy. It‚Äôs between me and Sarah. This silence. It‚Äôs not the peaceful kind of quiet you can be comfortable in. It‚Äôs heavy, thick with all the things we‚Äôre not saying, the things we don‚Äôt know how to say.

I don‚Äôt know when it started, this distance between us. Maybe after Emily was born, when everything became about her. We both love her, of course, but somewhere in all the diaper changes, late-night feedings, and endless responsibilities, we stopped seeing each other. Or maybe it was before that, and I just didn‚Äôt notice.

I sit across from Sarah at the kitchen table, and it feels like there‚Äôs a wall between us. She‚Äôs stirring her coffee, not drinking it, just lost in her thoughts. I wonder if she‚Äôs thinking the same things I am. Does she miss us? Does she feel as lost as I do? But I don‚Äôt ask. I never ask.

I look at her, really look at her for the first time in weeks. She looks tired, worn down, and I know I‚Äôm to blame for part of that. I don‚Äôt show up the way I used to. I used to hold her, kiss her, tell her I loved her, but now, most nights I just turn over in bed and stare at the wall. I don‚Äôt know how we got here.

‚ÄúAre you happy?‚Äù she asks suddenly, her voice quiet, like she‚Äôs afraid of the answer.

I freeze. The question hits me like a punch to the gut. Am I happy? I don‚Äôt even know what happiness feels like anymore. I love her‚ÄîI know that much. I love Emily, too. But happy?

I look at Sarah, and for a second, I think about lying, about saying yes, that we‚Äôre fine, that everything‚Äôs fine. But I can‚Äôt bring myself to do it. I haven‚Äôt been honest with myself in so long, but I owe her at least this much.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I say, my voice rougher than I meant it to be.

I see her nod, but she doesn‚Äôt look at me. She‚Äôs staring down at her coffee, like the answer was what she expected, but it still hurt her. I want to say more. I want to tell her that I‚Äôm sorry, that I want to fix things, but the words get stuck in my throat. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve forgotten how to talk to her, how to reach her.

Emily‚Äôs laughter breaks the silence, her little giggle carrying in from the other room. I close my eyes for a second, and I realize that she‚Äôs the only reason Sarah and I are still here, sitting at this table together. We‚Äôre both holding on for her. We‚Äôve built our entire lives around making sure Emily‚Äôs happy, but we‚Äôve let ourselves fall apart in the process.

I pick up my fork again and go back to eating. It feels like the moment to say something has passed, like it always does. Sarah doesn‚Äôt say anything either, just sits there, lost in her own thoughts. I glance at her again, and all I see is this gulf between us that I don‚Äôt know how to cross.

I know we can‚Äôt go on like this. This silence, this distance‚Äîit‚Äôs going to break us eventually. But I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I don‚Äôt know if we can fix it. All I know is that we‚Äôre not the people we used to be.
