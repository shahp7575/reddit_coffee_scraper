It was a warm, necessary ritual to kickstart my brain. The most complex thought I had about it was 'Did I add too much sugar?' I saw a simple, brown liquid in a mug, and that was that. Honestly, it was a simpler time.

Then came the university physics courses. I spent years wrestling with concepts that felt totally abstract. Thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, entropy... they were all just numbers and equations in a textbook. I passed the tests, but it never really felt *real*. It was just academic stuff you memorized. The magic wasn't there yet. I thought it never would be.

The 'click' didn't happen in a lab or during a final exam. It happened on a random Tuesday, while I was tiredly stirring my coffee. I watched the little whirlpool form, and suddenly, the floodgates opened. That wasn't just a swirl of coffee and cream; it was a vortex, a tiny, perfect example of fluid dynamics, governed by the same principles that create hurricanes and shape galaxies. The steam rising wasn't just steam; it was a visible ghost of energy, a story of water molecules getting so agitated they achieved escape velocity from the liquid.

The mug itself became an insulator, fighting a losing battle against the Second Law of Thermodynamics. My coffee was on a relentless, cosmic mission to reach thermal equilibrium with the room, and the ceramic was its only defense. The whole scene transformed from a mundane morning routine into this beautiful, intricate dance of invisible forces. It was like I could suddenly see the source code of reality.

It's a blessing and a curse, I guess. I can't see anything as 'simple' anymore. Everything is a complex, interconnected system. But it also means I find a sense of absolute wonder in the most boring, everyday things. So, Reddit, my question to you is: has learning about a specific subject ever completely changed the way you see a mundane object?",1,1763662677.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

I’m a SAHM to a 4 year old boy. I’m getting to a point where I feel like I want to do something for myself. I’d love to be able to make a small income for little things like dates with my kiddo or a coffee every once in a while. ( I could do these things now and my husband encourages me to, I just feel guilty). So I was wondering if there are any services other moms or caregivers would be willing to pay for? For example I’ve seen a mom who picks up car seats and cleans them and returns them to the home. I’ve also considered selling bread and bagels and things from my home. I’d love to be able to do something from home so I can still be with my lo. So if anyone has any ideas please let me know! Thanks in advance!",1,1763662557.0,Moms,1,1.0,False

He’d just moved into a new apartment and was eager to recreate the perfect movie-night atmosphere he loved so much. But as he scrolled through one streaming app after another, nothing felt right. Either the subscriptions were too expensive, or the content was boringly repetitive.

One evening, his roommate Mia came in holding a small package. “Check this out,” she said, placing a sleek streaming stick on the coffee table. “This will completely change the way you watch TV.” Ethan raised an eyebrow but decided to follow her lead, plugging the device into the TV.

Moments later, a clean and modern interface appeared on the screen  nothing like Netflix or YouTube. “This is the **TiviMate IPTV Player**,” Mia explained. “You can load your own channel playlists  live TV, movies, even international streams  and it organizes everything beautifully. No clunky menus, no endless scrolling.”

Ethan was cautious. “So… we’re basically pirating cable?” he asked. Mia shook her head. “Not at all. There are legal IPTV providers with licensed content. Even if you use public playlists, the player itself is completely legal and very well-designed.”

Intrigued, Ethan signed up for a trial with a reputable IPTV service Mia recommended. Instantly, the screen lit up with channels from across the globe  London news networks, Japanese anime, Spanish telenovelas, and local sports he’d never seen before. Everything was neatly arranged with a “Favorites” tab, a timeline for rewinding or skipping live TV, and an intuitive guide that made browsing feel effortless.

The next few hours flew by as they switched between a live soccer match, a space documentary, and a quirky French talk show. The video quality stayed sharp, with no buffering or pixelation. Ethan was hooked.

Over the next week, he dove deeper into customizing the TiviMate IPTV Player. He rearranged channels, grouped international streams, and even created categories like “Kids” for family movie nights and “Late-Night Sci-Fi” for solo binge sessions. The guide remembered his habits, making every session smoother than the last.

But one night, disaster struck: the stream froze in the middle of a crucial football game. Ethan groaned and rebooted the stick, but the glitch returned. Doubts crept in  maybe his old cable subscription was more reliable after all.

Mia, ever the problem-solver, guided him through some quick fixes: updating the TiviMate app, checking the internet speed, and adjusting the buffering settings. Within minutes, the stream was back, crystal clear and uninterrupted. Ethan realized that once everything was set up correctly, the **TiviMate IPTV Player** offered far more stability than he expected  plus endless options.

A month later, his entertainment bill had dropped significantly. Instead of paying for a bulky cable package he rarely used, he had a lean, flexible setup. He watched European documentaries, followed his favorite soccer league, and even caught late-night comedy from around the world.

One Friday evening, Ethan hosted a “digital TV night” for friends. He showed them how the TiviMate IPTV Player worked, how simple it was to navigate, and how customized his playlists had become. Everyone was impressed. When someone asked where to get it, Ethan grinned: “It’s not about the service  it’s about the player. With TiviMate, TV finally feels like your TV.”

He grabbed a bowl of popcorn, poured a soda, and leaned back. For the first time in a long while, watching TV felt like an adventure he had built himself.",1,1763662511.0,urbantv,0,1.0,False
1p2agnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1p2agnp/method_how_i_completely_reset_my_life_and_became/,[METHOD] How I completely reset my life and became unrecognisable.,"A bit about my story. I want to share this because if even one person reads this and decides to change, it’ll be worth it.

Two months ago I was the definition of a degenerate loser. I’m not saying that to be dramatic, I genuinely was. I would wake up at 2pm, immediately open my laptop and start gaming. League of Legends, Valorant, whatever. I’d game until 4 or 5am, sometimes later. In between matches I’d be scrolling through Twitter, watching porn, eating junk food that I’d order with my parents money. My room stunk badly. I hadn’t seen sunlight in weeks. I dropped out of college because I just stopped going to class. My parents were disappointed but at some point they just gave up on me.

The worst part wasn’t even the gaming or the porn or the fact that I had no friends. The worst part was that I knew I was wasting my life and I felt completely powerless to stop it. I would tell myself every single night “tomorrow I’ll change” and then tomorrow would come and I’d do the exact same thing. It was like I was watching myself from outside my body, just spiraling.

# THE WAKE UP CALL

I remember the exact moment I decided to change. My mom came into my room one afternoon (I had just woken up) and she didn’t say anything. She just looked at me with this look of sadness and left. Not anger, not disappointment, just sadness. Like she was mourning someone who was still alive. That hit me harder than any lecture ever could.

I realized that I had been living like this for almost 4 years. 4 entire years of my life, just gone. I was 24 years old and I had nothing. No degree, no job, no skills, no friends, no girlfriend, nothing. I was so far behind everyone I went to high school with that it felt impossible to ever catch up.

But I also realized something else. I had tried to change before and it never worked because I would try to fix everything at once. I’d wake up one day and be like “okay, from today I’m going to lock in, wake up at 5am, hit the gym, eat healthy, study for 8 hours, quit gaming, quit porn, meditate, read, everything.” And it would last maybe 3 days before I’d crash and go right back to my old habits.

# THE SYSTEM

So I started researching. I spent probably a week just reading everything I could find about habit formation, discipline, and how people actually change their lives. I read through Harvard studies on behavior change, looked at recovery programs, read books like Atomic Habits and The Slight Edge. I went through hundreds of Reddit posts from people who had transformed their lives.

What I found was that almost everyone who successfully changed their life did it gradually. There’s actual science behind this. Your brain needs time to fully rewire itself and form new neural pathways. If you can stick to new habits consistently, they become your new default.

But here’s the key, you can’t just randomly do things. You need a structured plan that progressively gets harder as you build capacity. It’s like progressive overload in the gym, but for your entire life.

I needed something that would start where I actually was, not where I thought I should be. Week one I was waking up at 10am. A few weeks later I was waking up at 8am. Week one I was working out for 15 minutes twice a week. Eventually I was doing 90 minute workouts six days a week. Week one I was reading 5 pages a couple times. Eventually I was reading 20 pages every single day.

The increases were so gradual that they never felt impossible. When you’re doing 15 minute workouts and you bump it up to 30 minutes the next week, that doesn’t feel that hard. Your body and mind adapt slowly.

# THE TOOLS THAT SAVED ME

I’m not going to lie, the first few weeks were still hard. My brain kept trying to negotiate with me. “Just one game. Just check Twitter for 5 minutes. Just skip the workout today, you can do it tomorrow.”

What helped me the most was removing the ability to negotiate. I started using an app blocker to completely lock myself out of games, porn sites, social media, all of it during certain hours. The app I ended up using is called Reload. It blocks all the distracting stuff but the part that really helped was that it generates a personalized plan based on your current situation and gives you daily tasks. So instead of just taking away the bad stuff, it replaces it with productive stuff that’s actually tailored to where you’re at.

The other thing that kept me going was the ranked mode where you compete against other people on a leaderboard. I know that sounds stupid but I’m a competitive person (probably why I was so addicted to gaming) and seeing other people ahead of me made me not want to slack off. It turned self improvement into something my gamer brain could latch onto.

# THE REALITY (IT WASN’T PERFECT)

I need to be honest here because I don’t want to make this sound like some fairy tale. I relapsed multiple times. There were days where I spent the entire day gaming and felt like absolute shit afterward, almost giving up completely. There were stretches where I skipped workouts for multiple days straight because I was “too tired.” There were days where I watched porn multiple times and convinced myself I’d ruined everything and should just quit.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

But here’s what I learned, relapsing doesn’t erase your progress. The streak matters less than the overall trend. If you’re doing well 80% of the time, you’re still winning. The old me would have used one bad day as an excuse to quit entirely. The new me just got back on track the next day.

There were also days where I only hit like half my targets. Days where I woke up late, skipped meditation, didn’t read, whatever. That’s fine. Life happens. The difference is that I didn’t let one bad day turn into a bad week.

# WHAT CHANGED

I’m about two months in now and my life is unrecognizable.

I wake up around 8am most days without an alarm. I work out 5 to 6 days a week and I actually enjoy it. I’ve read maybe 10 books. I meditate most mornings. I’m studying programming and I’m actually decent at it. I got a part time job at a coffee shop just to have something to do and to be around people. I’ve made two friends. I game maybe once a week now and it doesn’t consume me like it used to. I haven’t watched porn in over a month. My room is clean. I eat real food.

But the biggest change is internal. I don’t feel like a loser anymore. I don’t feel like I’m watching my life from the outside. I feel like I’m actually in control. When I look in the mirror I don’t feel disgusted. I feel proud.

My mom came into my room last week and she just smiled at me. She didn’t say anything, she just smiled and gave me a hug. That meant more to me than anything.

# IF YOU’RE WHERE I WAS

If you’re reading this and you’re in the same place I was, I just want you to know that it’s possible. You’re not broken. You’re not too far gone. Your brain is just stuck in a loop and you need to break the loop.

But you can’t do it by trying to change everything at once. You need a system. You need a plan that starts where you are right now, not where you think you should be.

The plan I followed had three different difficulty levels. An easy version for people who are really deep in it like I was. A medium version for people who are somewhat functional but want to level up. And a hard version for people who are already doing okay but want to maximize everything.

The easy version starts you waking up at 10am and doing 15 minute workouts. The hard version starts you at 7am doing 45 minute workouts. You pick based on where you are right now, not where you wish you were.

It covers everything. When to wake up, how long to work out, how far to run, cold showers (trust me on this), how much water to drink, how much to read, how much time you’re allowed on social media, meditation time, deep work time, and journaling. Everything is structured week by week with progressive increases.

What I liked about using an app for this is that I didn’t have to think about it every day or track everything manually. It just tells me what to do based on which week I’m on and I do it. It blocks the distractions during the hours I need to focus. It tracks my habits so I can see my streak building up.

# THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT

I mentioned I looked into the research behind this. Here’s what I found that made me believe it would actually work.

Harvard has done studies showing that it takes about two months on average to form a new habit. Some habits take less time, some take more, but this timeframe is right in that sweet spot where your brain starts to rewire itself.

There’s also research on something called ego depletion. Basically, willpower is a finite resource. If you try to change too many things at once, you run out of willpower and everything falls apart. But if you change things gradually and build systems, you’re not relying on willpower anymore, you’re relying on routine.

The other thing is dopamine regulation. When you’re addicted to gaming and porn and social media, your dopamine receptors are completely fried. You need massive amounts of stimulation just to feel normal. But if you cut out the superstimuli and replace them with healthy activities, your dopamine receptors heal over time. After a while, normal activities start to feel rewarding again.

Cold showers are in there because they’ve been shown to increase dopamine by 250% for hours afterward. Reading is in there because it’s one of the few activities that can create a flow state without overstimulating you. Meditation is in there because it literally changes your brain structure after several weeks of consistent practice.

Everything has a reason. It’s not random.

# MY ADVICE

Start today. Not tomorrow, today. Pick the difficulty level that matches where you are right now. If you’re deep in the hole like I was, start with easy. There’s no shame in that. Easy mode still transforms your life, it just does it more gradually.

Follow the plan as closely as you can. Don’t skip days intentionally. Don’t negotiate with yourself. But also understand that you will mess up sometimes and that’s okay. Just get back on track.

Use tools to remove temptation. You cannot willpower your way out of addiction when the addictive thing is one click away. You need to make it hard to access the bad stuff and easy to access the good stuff.

Track your progress somehow. I journal a couple times a week about how I’m feeling and what’s working. Seeing the progress written out is incredibly motivating.

Find competition or accountability. Whether it’s a leaderboard, a friend, or just posting updates somewhere, having external pressure helps a lot.

Remember that relapsing doesn’t mean failure. I relapsed multiple times and I’m still here. The difference between success and failure is whether you get back up or stay down.

# FINAL THOUGHTS

Two months is not that long. It’s eight weeks. A couple months from now you could be a completely different person. Or you could still be exactly where you are right now, just older and further behind.

I wasted two years of my life before I figured this out. Don’t waste any more time. Start today.

My dog Leo isn’t just “high-energy”—he’s a 70-pound demolition crew with a PhD in Creative Destruction. “Indestructible” toys? He turns them into confetti in five minutes flat. Then he gets bored and redesigns my furniture with his teeth.

But this toy? Jesus Christ.

He threw it so hard it left a mark on the drywall. He power-bombed it into the baseboards. He drop-kicked it across the hardwood like a soccer ball. I stopped counting the impacts after twenty, flinching each time, waiting for the inevitable plastic explosion.

Perfectly intact. Not even a dent.

That inner piece moves like it’s taunting him—constantly shifting, never predictable. It’s turned my meathead puppy into a furry little engineer, obsessed with cracking the code. He’ll spend an hour straight methodically working it, panting, completely locked in, forgetting the world exists.

The result? My couch cushions are unmolested. My shoes are whole. My baseboards are clean. Leo is sprawled out, actually exhausted from using his brain instead of just his body. I drank my coffee while it was hot. *Hot.*

Whoever you are: you didn’t recommend a toy. You gave me back my security deposit and my sanity.

1p2ac2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/1p2ac2p/a_money_testimonial_rant/,A Money Testimonial Rant,"Let me be clear, if 100 people were to review my finances, I would likely receive 100 pieces of critical feedback. My spending and financial management are far from perfect. I often criticize myself for spending money on things I shouldn't. Now, at 62 years old, I’ve just started semi-retirement, receiving Social Security benefits while still working 24 hours a week. For most of my adult life, I’ve been financially irresponsible (FI). I spent everything I had without regard for my bills, which led to a couple of car repossessions and a lengthy period of living in my mother’s rental properties while frequently neglecting to pay rent. Being financially irresponsible cost me my marriage and strained my relationship with my son.

 I’ve realized that being financially irresponsible can be akin to an addiction to drugs or alcohol. In my early 50s, I experienced a spiritual and life awakening when my soulmate of 15 years passed away after a three-year battle with cancer. Just four months prior, I had joined my siblings to bury our mother, leaving us all parentless. These profound events forced me to confront the reality of my life and commit to getting my act together. It wasn’t an overnight success; rather, it took a few years of establishing a routine and committing to responsible financial practices. 

Through trial and error, I developed a routine that has made budgeting automatic for me. Every back-to-school season, I go to the Dollar Tree and purchase a three-pack of composition notebooks for $1.25, which lasts me most of the year. I use these notebooks, along with a calculator and a pen, as my budgeting tools. Every Sunday morning, I treat myself to a cinnamon roll and coffee while I review my bank accounts, credit card balances, and weekly spending. It’s very simple: I write my bank balance at the top of the page and list my upcoming bills and future expenses below. I get paid every other Monday night from work, and my Social Security check arrives on the second Saturday of the month. Each time I receive one of these checks, I take my notebook, pen, and calculator, write down my new bank balance, list upcoming bills and necessary expenses, and calculate from there to pay those bills instantly. I have all my bills set up for electronic payment. But it doesn’t stop there. 

Having not been the tidiest person throughout my life, I realized that it was important to become more organized. Everyone knows the feeling of having a low or overdrawn bank account, with overdue notices piling up and uncertainty about how to afford your next meal. It’s hard to manage when dishes are piled in the sink, the kitchen counter and floor are dirty, trash bags are in the corner, and clothes are strewn about. As part of my journey to get my life together, I meticulously cleaned each room, moving furniture and deep cleaning along the way. I emptied kitchen cabinets that contained either little food or items that were outdated and needed to be thrown away. I did the same with my car. It took a while to establish a routine for maintaining a clean home and vehicle. My daily motto helped me stay on track: 

# ""I wake in a clean home, I go to work from a clean home, I come home to a clean home, and I go to bed in a clean home."" 

I apply the same philosophy to my car. When my environment is simple and clean, it becomes easier to manage my budget and financial practices. Although it’s not perfect all the time, my financial situation is 500% better than it was, and money is no longer the burden it used to be. The bottom line is that keeping a budget isn’t just about calculations and apps; it encompasses our entire day and life. Currently, I don’t have overdue notices, and I no longer stress about repossessions or power being shut off. On a humorous note, I haven’t missed a bill payment or been late in over three years, and sometimes I wish these companies would congratulate me for paying my bills on time! Then I remind myself that’s simply what we’re supposed to do as adults. 

Apologies for the long rant, but I hope this message resonates with someone. I’ve learned a lot from this community and picked up some great practices. Keep up the amazing work, everyone!",1,1763662183.0,budget,0,1.0,False

My dad (67) has oral cancer with metastatic carcinoma manifesting through his skin. He has necrotic wounds (straight up holes through which I can see his insides) on the side of his neck and behind his ear, and more just waiting to open up on the front of his neck. It's absolutely horrific. Those holes all opened up since October. I can see them worsening daily. 

Cancer is one thing but those open wounds, they give me intense anxiety that I have never felt before. His carotid is exposed, covered only by a gauze dressing. It took seeing 6 doctors in total just to learn how to dress it, two of which were his oncologists who never mentioned necrosis, never took the time to even examine it up close (neither of them even got out of their chairs) and told me just to disinfect it with alcohol. I am also trying to figure out how to deal with my resentment towards the doctors, but another part of me also understands there's not much they could have done anyway.

It's really sad to see my dad with these awful scars that will never heal. I wish he could at least die with a dignified body (at least from the outside).

He's moody, in pain (probably damaged nerves from surgery), barely mobile (can walk but getting in and out of bed is very difficult). We had sad but lovely conversations even a couple weeks ago about how he wants to stay around if possible, but now he's only expressing anger and annoyance. 

Doctors gave 2-3 months and is recommending hospice. He is still on his last course of chemo but it seems hopeless judging by those holes waiting to open up. He has bloodwork tomorrow and I'm sure the onco will mention hospice again. I wish my mom would take the in-hospital option but I know she won't. She believes ""nothing is sadder than dying in a hospital"".  

My question is, what can I expect from hospice? Once he is on unlimited supply of painkillers, will he be happier? Will he talk to us kindly again? Can he leave the house, can we go for drives, can my mom have coffee dates with her husband of 40 years? He's not a very social person, he doesn't really like anyone outside of his immediate family.... But I just want his last days to have at least SOME happy moments, at least for my mom.

I live abroad and I have to leave in 10 days. I had no idea it was this bad. I am so heartbroken to leave my dad and mom like this.

My partner and I are excited to be moving to Denver next summer! Any thoughts on neighborhoods we should check out when we come to visit next month?

Here’s a bit about us:
*We’re in our late 20s/early 30s and don’t have kids (still undergoing the existential crisis of whether or not we will in the near future)

* We have 2 dogs so a fenced yard would be ideal (but doesn’t have to be large)

* Like everyone else here, we want to live close ish to the mountains since we love to hike, ski, etc. (we used to live in the Sierras so are no stranger to snow/weather)

* Unfortunately, our jobs will be in Cherry Creek and Louisville and we’d have to be in office 2-3 days/week. Ideally neither of us would have to commute longer than ~45 minutes in traffic

* Being able to walk/bike to at least a few things (local coffee shops, restaurants, etc.) is important to us

* We plan to rent for a bit while we save up to buy so our budget is roughly $3,300/month for 2+ bedrooms but we can definitely stretch that for the right spot

* Bonus: nearby activities for people in our age group (run clubs, climbing meet ups, soccer leagues, etc)

* Bonus bonus: we have shared one car for the past several years but know that unfortunately we’ll have to get a second car with this move/our jobs. Any experiences renting with an EV or plug-in hybrid?

1p2ab54,https://www.reddit.com/r/CADAI/comments/1p2ab54/why_engineers_still_love_paper_prints_and_why/,Why Engineers Still Love Paper Prints (and Why That’s Changing),"I was cleaning out an old storage cabinet a few months ago and found a stack of prints from a project I worked on sometime around 2004. Full size sheets, coffee stains on half of them, red pen scribbles on the rest. I flipped through them and realized something funny. Even after all the digital tools we have today, those paper prints still felt familiar and natural in a way a monitor never quite does.

A lot of younger engineers look at paper prints like they are some relic from the Stone Age. But anyone who has been around for a while knows the truth. There are real reasons why paper stuck around for decades.

Paper forces you to slow down. When you spread a drawing on a table, you are not bouncing between tabs or zooming into tiny corners. You look at the whole part. This helps you catch things that slip by on screen. I still remember a time when a machining operation would have ruined an entire batch because the radius callout on a fillet was wrong. It was spotted by a machinist who had the print pinned on a board. He noticed the mismatch at a glance.

Another reason is the physical scale. A full size drawing on a table gives you a natural sense of proportion. I have seen people miss a clearance problem simply because they were zoomed in at 300 percent and forgot how big the feature actually was in real life. On paper you cannot hide behind zoom levels. The drawing shows its truth whether you like it or not.

That said, something has been shifting. More companies are moving away from prints entirely. Not because paper is bad but because the rest of the workflow is changing. The teams downstream want models with built in data. Shops want revision control without chasing stacks of paper. And the truth is that digital tools have gotten better at replicating the clarity that paper used to offer.

When I look at younger machinists or technicians, I notice they flip through 3D views more comfortably than I flip through sheets. They rotate, explode, slice, measure, and search for the info they want. For them it is natural. And with good training and better standards, digital workflows create fewer chances for someone to work from an outdated print.

What surprised me most is how many old habits were never about the paper at all. They were about trust. People trusted the print because it stayed what it was. These days, if the digital system is set up well, the model can provide the same kind of certainty.

The way I see it, paper is not disappearing because it failed. It is disappearing because the environment around it finally caught up.

I am curious what everyone else is seeing. Do you still rely on printed drawings in your shop or team, or have you already moved to screens only?",1,1763662126.0,CADAI,0,1.0,False

To start, I put full-time in quotes because I just don't really feel like I do it full-time. I only go to college once a week, and then, out of the 6 days left, I maybe only spend a 8-10 hours total actually working. Also, I work 3 days at a supermarket, but I'm going to cut down to 2 for the winter at least.

Anyway, my daily routine looks like this:
- Wake up around 8AM
- Read a book/watch tv until 10AM
- Make mom & I breakfast  (she works from home, so I make her breakfast and coffee everyday) until 10:30AM
- Watch tv/play video game until 12PM
- On the day, maybe 2, that I do school, I'll do school work until 4-6PM
- On the days I work, I work from 5PM-10PM
- Eat dinner
- Watch tv/read book/play video game
- Sleep

Unfortunately, I haven't hade friends besides my mom since I was 16, and there's not much to do near me (and I can't drive yet), so I spend most days holed up in my house on the couch.

It kind of drives me nuts living the same day over and over, but I find solace in telling myself that these are just the ""filler episodes"" of my life and that it'll all change when I go to university in a year.",1,1763661751.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I’ve heard it said, “If the average believer truly understood what would happen if he used the Bible more often, he would open it more often.” The reason is simple: Other books are given to us for information; the Bible has been given to us for transformation.

The tragedy is that according to surveys I have read, the average Christian opens his Bible once or twice a week at most—and that includes Sundays.

Well, the fact that you have joined me in this Wisdom Journey through the entire Bible indicates that you are *not* the average Christian! You are wanting to be transformed by biblical truth as we study together through all sixty-six books of this transforming, inspired book.

Now so far here in Psalm 19, we have discovered that God speaks daily through His big book—that is, creation. We call this *general revelation*. It’s general, in that it is generally available to everybody on the planet. All they have to do is look around at this big universe.

But God also has given us a little Book—the Bible—which we call *special revelation*. It is unique for it is divinely inspired—breathed out—by God (2 Timothy 3:16-17). But you have to read it in order to find out what God has in mind.

What we have read so far in Psalm 19 has told us some of what the Bible *is*. David also has told us some things the Bible *does*—it revives us, makes us wise, and gives us joy.

We are now in verse 8, where David adds, “The commandment of the Lord is pure.” That word “pure” means without contamination. God’s commandments are free from corruption; they will keep your heart from becoming contaminated too.

One of Satan’s most popular lies is that if you obey God’s Word, you are going to miss out on something in life. That’s a lie!

But how do you get spiritual 20/20 vision so you can spot that kind of lie? David says here at the end of verse 8 that the commandment of the Lord enlightens the eyes. The Hebrew construction implies that God’s Word gives off light—like a candle in a dark room.

David goes on in verse 9 to say,“The fear of the Lord is clean.”“Fear” is used here as another term for the law. The word for “clean” is used often in Exodus and Leviticus to describe a person who is ceremonially cleansed and able to offer God a sacrifice. 

Here’s the picture David is giving us. You think you are walking in the right direction, but then you open God’s Word, and it sheds light on some area in your life that isn’t right. When you confess that sin to the Lord, He cleanses you (1 John 1:9), and then you are able to really enjoy fellowship with the Lord once again.

Imagine that! The God who created the universe wants you to fellowship with Him. 

Then David says here in verse 9 that the fear, or Word, of the Lord “endures forever.”The other day my wife had a box of canned goods for me to take to the garbage collector because the items had expired. 

David is telling us the Bible does not have an expiration date. And I’m thankful for that, because today our world—and even the church at large—thinks that so much of God’s Word is out of date and needs to be thrown out. 

But the Bible lasts forever. Jesus said in Matthew 24:35, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.” There is no expiration date on the truth of God’s Word. You might apply things differently in this dispensation than in the Old Testament but its truth remains timeless and its principles can be applied to your life to this very day.

David adds here in verse 9, “The rules of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.” In other words, the Bible will never lead you astray. Charles Spurgeon wrote many years ago, “The word of God is founded in righteousness and thus it is always right.”\[1\] That’s true – because God’s Word is God’s words.

These are God’s words. They represent His character and reveal His heart. They cannot be anything but true and righteous altogether.

When you make choices according to God’s Word, you are not going to miss the mark. I remember reading about a television show where they staged an experiment with a real cannon. They wanted to see what would happen if they fired a cannonball into a large container of water. So, they got everything ready, trained their cameras, and then fired that cannon. Unfortunately, the crew had not aimed it correctly.

According to a newspaper report, “The cannonball missed the water containers, flew through a cinder-block wall, skipped off a hillside, flew 700 yards over a highway, and finally slammed into a minivan parked in a driveway.” Local authorities could only shake their heads in amazement.\[2\]

That was a lot of damage from one stray cannonball! When you and I get off track, the damage to our lives can be just as terrible. How do we stay on track? How do we hit the mark? How do we aim our lives in the right direction? David would say, “Let God aim your life according to the truth of His Word.”

Now that David has told us what the Bible *is* and what the Bible *does*, he tells us what the Bible *becomes* for us.

First, it becomes *our greatest treasure*. He says here in verse 10:“More to be desired are they than gold.” “They” is referring to the law, the testimony, the precepts, the commandments, and the rules of God. They are more desirable than gold, and David adds, “even much fine gold.”And remember, this is written by a king who had a lot of gold in his bank account.

If David were living today, he might illustrate this by inviting us to take a trip over to Fort Knox, Kentucky. Go deep down into the vault, where you are surrounded by thousands of tons of gold bullion. Then look at your Bible and say, “You know, if I have to choose, I’ll choose the Bible, over all that gold.” Why? Because gold cannot restore your life and make you wise and give you joy and enlighten your eyes and aim your life in the right direction and keep you on track.

David knew that gold can get us off track, so he made this comparison. Don’t aim your life in that direction. Keep in mind that one day in the Father’s house, we are going to discover that gold has been used to cover all the streets and sidewalks. It is nothing more than common asphalt in heaven.

David goes on to say that the Bible becomes *our sweetest delight.* Verse 10 says God’s Word is “sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.” It makes your mouth water, doesn’t it? In David’s day, sweetness was measured by comparison to honey.

Honey is an amazing product. It is all natural; it digests easily; and it provides immediate energy. I use it to sweeten my cup of coffee every morning at home. If it offends you that I drink coffee, well, you’re just going to have to get over it. I like coffee, and I don’t like cats—you’re going to have to forgive me for that too.

The thing about honey is that we don’t make it, and we didn’t invent it—God did. All we do is collect it, eat it, and gain energy and delight from it.\[3\]

And that is the sweet delight of God’s Word. We didn’t write it, and we didn’t invent it—God did. All we do is read it and savor it, and it sweetens our lives and brings delight to our hearts.

So, let’s make sure today we thank God for revealing Himself in the big book of creation and in the little Book of great treasure—the Word of God.

**BLURB:**

Do we take the Bible for granted? We need to treat it as the treasure it is—the enduring Word of God Himself, which offers guidance and instruction that is as trustworthy as the one who gave it. Psalm 19 reminds us that God’s Word is of far greater value than “much fine gold.”

I was born in 86 so came of age during the height of the anti smoking campaign. I remember as a preteen almost all the grown ups I knew smoked. By the time I was in my late teens / early 20s very few grown ups smoked. This was also the same time the obesity crisis took off. The surgeon general made commercials saying obesity was the new tobacco. Whenever I asked grownups why they smoked I'm surprised none of them just gave me the honest straightforward answer (they would always just say ""cause I've been doing it"") which is that smoking suppresses appetite, relieves stress, and improves focus. Before the late 90s workers at nearly every business I could think of (even the workers at elementary schools) would get together outside, socialize and have a smoke break. Now a break means sitting at your desk and eating snacks. 

Long story short, life is rough and people need a form of stress relief. Telling people to exercise isnt practical, most 9-5 Americans with kids don't have the time/energy to workout everyday (I workout 6 days a week and eat healthy but I'm a single guy who lines alone). And to be clear I'm not saying people should smoke, but pushing people to quit smoking without offering an alternative has backfired big-time.  Coffee can help but it doesn't have near the stimulating/energy supressing effects that nicotine does. 

BTW this is just my 2 cents, I don't have any studies to back this up. ",3,1763661410.0,NoStupidQuestions,14,0.8,False
1p29zm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1p29zm9/update_to_an_update_my_bil_hates_my_favorite/,Update to an update: My BIL hates my favorite artist,"Hey all! Just wanted to clarify a few things and it’s too much to comment so boom, third post. 

Am I a crazy swiftie? 
I don’t think so but maybe? Definitely don’t have a parasocial relationship with the woman, I absolutely agree there’s a lot of die hard fans that go way too hard and think just because she’s this ultra famous pop star she can do no wrong. 

I don’t agree with all of her actions/opinions/etc. She’s done a lot of fucked up shit that I don’t agree with, but I still like her music and the production that went in to the eras tour was awesome to see live. I also don’t like every album in its entirety, listening to a whole album straight through is pretty rare for me. 

I also don’t own like a buttload of merch or anything, there’s a few of my cardigans that are admittedly knock offs. 
I LOVE a cardigan, not just hers- most of my fall/winter wardrobe consists of cardigans and plain tees. 
Besides the cardigans I have 2 hoodies and a tee shirt of hers + one of each vinyl (I didn’t know adding an S was a hot take, thanks guys! You learn something new everyday). 
I’m all for the people who got it like that, spend your money however you want but personally don’t have enough money to throw a ton of it at a billionaire for a $100 jacket or anything, even if I do like some of them. 

Why I like her: 
To those guessing, yes- I did grow up with her! Debut dropped when I was like..6-7, I think? It was the first CD I ever owned and best believe I was jumping up and down in my PJs to it regularly before school. It’s something my mom and I have bonded over (she took me to the eras tour), my partner and I have bonded over (believe it or not he listens to her more than I do), and in general- I’ve had a pretty good experience with her fan base. So I guess there’s a nostalgia factor there but I also just.. like it. Couldn’t tell ya why, the same way I couldn’t explain why my favorite color is my favorite color. Some of it is too poppy for me, too dramatic, too focused on men, too repetitive. I fully admit not everyone song is worthy of the hype it receives (and debatably isn’t good) but it’s fun to listen. 

Am I listening obsessively? 
I don’t want to play her music everyday or anything. But I did absolutely want to listen to and enjoy the new album without being made to feel bad. It was the first vinyl I was able to buy at release instead of collect later, there were a lot of tiktok trends that came with the drop that I thought were funny, and I enjoyed the build up with her appearing on Kelce’s pod. 

The frequency my BIL had to endure: 
Over 3 weeks- 
1 full listen through of the new album 
About 10 additional songs 
5-6 tiktoks shared (not to BIL) 
Roughly 3 15/20minute conversations (2 about the new album/pod/merch with my partner, 1 about the new album/reminiscing on the tour with my mom) 

Amounting to: roughly 128 minutes total so about 6 minutes a day
 (assuming each song is 4 minutes, each TikTok is 30seconds, every conversation was a full 20 minutes + the 45 minute album) 
I’m not sure where everyone is getting that I want to talk about her 45 minutes a day. 

The solution/responding to some opinions: 
Was my BIL playing me? Maybe. But he’s been great since so I’m optimistic. 

Was I too tolerant? For sure. None of the shit that was happening in my house (door slamming, throwing stuff around, interrupting my partners work) should’ve been happening. 

Was it dumb to make a post? Probably. To the people pointing out it’s free material for the pod: absolutely it is. That doesn’t bother me though. I don’t spend A TON of time on the internet so Im sure there was a better place to post but I hate the hard core comments I see on other subs + I like the pod. 

Was he actually subjecting himself to her or was it our wifi? Could’ve been both! His Google searches were crazy. He totally went down the rabbit hole all on his own at least a decent amount of the time. I saw/heard a lot of conspiracy theories (did yall know she’s literally the devil reincarnated?). But I’ve also been victim to recommendations I’m not into that other people I live with are, so it’s a toss up and we’ll probably never know which possibility was having the highest impact. 

Did I actually have people IRL reading the post? Yeah. Like I said, I’ve put pretty much everyone I talk to onto the pod. My friends and I regularly find the craziest stories we can on Reddit to share with each other, a lot of them originating from the pods sub. So of course, my post got sent to me a few times with a “this u?” 

Was I a pushover? At first, yeah. The thought of losing a relationship that I’ve been building for so long with my BIL was terrifying to me. 
Before he’d moved in, he was my rock. He’s helped me pack and move twice, helped me get dressed during flair ups when I couldn’t myself, proof read every nervous text I’ve sent for years, backed me up when there was family drama (even when it cost him family), babysat my pets without complaint last minute when I’ve needed to travel. He’s always been there. 

This behavior was completely out of character for him and a total shock to me. It wasn’t acceptable behavior in the slightest but I’ve never been in that position before and certainly not with him.  

Am I helping too much? Who’s to say. As long as he’s treating me well, I’m happy to help. I don’t mind teaching financing or budgeting, I agree he should know those skills by now but I don’t fault him for not, I know the way that he grew up. If no one ever takes the time to show you a good example or explain.. how else do you learn? Too often people continue down a bad road, simply for lack of knowledge and because it’s what feels familiar to them. 

People have lost the idea of community. You’ve gotta be there for people, yall. Putting people on their ass over dumb shit/drama (yes, I agree that’s what it is aka part of the reason I was so baffled and lost) is an awful go to. 
Not being willing to teach people skills they clearly don’t know, just because they SHOULD know, because it asks extra work of you isn’t how you show up for people you love. 
Keeping score all the time is how you destroy the possibility of a good thing. I’d rather be taken advantage of for my niceness 1,000x over than let the world turn me cold. 

Should I have been fronting everything? No. But again, as long as he’s being respectful- I don’t mind. It’s a bit much and for sure a drain on my resources but I’d want someone to do the same for me. I could’ve only covered the bare minimum and put a roof over his head + food in his mouth, but what kind of life is that? I could die tomorrow and take nothing to the grave. I didn’t have to dip into my savings, the sacrifice was a handful of less date nights and excursions, “fun money” for less than 2 months. 
Not a big deal to me until you add in the other things that were going on. 

Am I still covering things? No! He’s paid us rent, he’s covering his own extra wants, and has treated us to breakfast/coffee/dinner/weed since getting somewhat more back on his feet.  

Are biweekly sit downs too much? Probably. I’m admittedly type A af. We’re not just bitching at eachother the whole time or anything though. 
We go over events happening soon (concerts, date night plans, new restaurants opening, seasonal markets), bills, groceries (planning meals we want to cook together, ingredients, household needs), how we want to decorate the house (for holidays and stuff), and anything else on our mind (sometimes that does mean we bitch at eachother). 

It’s just a safe place for us to sit down and talk. We all work conflicting schedules, have our own lives, and want to make sure we’re intentionally setting aside time to talk about whatever we need to. 

Was listening to his feelings before setting down boundaries us pandering to him? I don’t think so. If it had been a pattern of his, maybe. Some people are just assholes.  For him, it was relevant though. Knowing he was in a mental health crisis and scared to ask for help colors the situation. It doesn’t mean anything he was doing is okay or excusable, however- if we hadn’t known what was going on and gotten him help, we never would’ve been getting the full picture. His ‘why’ isn’t an excuse but it is an explanation. 

Thank you all for your input! I’ve read some nice comments and mean comments. I’ve read A LOT of comments misgendering me (come on, guys). I’ve read helpful comments, not so helpful comments, comments that think I’m a bitch, and comments calling me an angel.

Anyway, this girl, Ramona, finally got on cheer team because she was feeding gossip to the cheer captain about her rivals and doing her homework, etc.

Anyway, that power went to Ramona's head and BOOM! She pulled a gatekeeping move, like Rachel Hollis, on another girl trying out for cheer senior year, and that girl happened to be a little sister of one of the actual best friends of the cheer captain -- in other words, when push comes to shove, Ramona's (like Rachel's) transactional friendship meant jack-shite compared to the cheer captain's REAL (read: generationally wealthy) friends and their siblings.

But I digress -- NOT enough coffee in me yet! 😅

Moral of the story:  Rachel Hollis is the living embodiment of an American, perhaps universal, archetype, the snitch/suck-up/wannabe who oversteps & gets slapped back to the ""sweet women"" horde from whence she two-faced & backstabbed her way up from but thinks she can just come back to and use again. That's why this video never ceases to get old for me and others.

1p29vg9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p29vg9,LOCATION: TN - My landlord is evicting me claiming I failed to maintain the property,"
Last night, a processor came to my house to give a court document. Upon opening it, I discovered it was a termination of occupancy letter from my landlord’s attorney, alleging that I failed to maintain the sink, leading to water damage on the floor. 

For context, I paid my landlord $5 upfront in rent, one dollar for each of the five years, in November 2023. It’s a month-to-month renting situation. This used to be my grandmother’s house, but became his after she passed away a year before the lease signing and payment. I became the sole occupant of this house after my uncle Roger, who used to also be a tenant, assaulted me and I called the police back in June, which led to a no contact order between us. Roger was the one who installed the sink months ago with my landlord’s approval. Shortly after, the drain started leaking. 

On October 22, my landlord and his wife came over to do an inspection of the sink and also handed me a letter referencing the assault, saying that such a thing won’t be tolerated, and stating that yard work and taking out the trash needed to be done, which I have been doing. Along with this, they gave me a new copy of the lease with just my name on it, unlike the other which had both my name *and* Roger’s. Throughout this interaction, there was absolutely no talk of eviction. His wife even implied I had until 2028 to figure out another living arrangement, saying something to the effect of, “When the lease is up after five years, you’re gonna have to figure out what you’re gonna do.” She also said to let this be a learning lesson and reprimanded me for not having a professional come regularly to check the HVAC, despite the lease agreement not saying anything about that. The lease says under “Upkeep & Maintenance” that “tenant(s) are responsible for all damage to the property.” Nothing more, nothing less. My dad was at the house the day before to inspect the sink himself after I told him about it, and he broke a doorknob trying to break Roger’s bedroom door down since it was locked. I told my landlord and his wife about that and she said they weren’t worried about that, but then got on to me for reporting it after it happened, despite saying I should report to them every single thing that goes on. 

I apologized to them both and said I would do a better job with upkeep. All things considered, I thought it was just a warning. I lost my car and my job as a delivery driver back in May and I’ve been struggling to find a new job ever since (my disabilities don’t help), which has affected how fast and able I am to address issues. I’ve been relying on donations from people and stretching every dollar to be able to feed myself and pay the bills. Over the next few days, my dad fixed the sink and even a couple of other things too. 

I currently have nowhere else to go aside from a shelter and I still have yet to find a job. I’m also trying to get in touch with legal aid in my area.

TW: Emotional abuse, manipulation, controlling parent.

Looking for advice on what to do next.

Note: my GF approved this post and read it over as well

I 25 M met my 21 F 3 years ago, things between us have been good and I see good things in her as well as a future with her.   Fake names i will call my girlfriend Alexis. 
The problems we have are small and manageable normal things. However we have one very bad downfall to our relationship and its her parents (50s M & F)

 I dont even know where to begin but I will admit Alexis did warn me of them before we started getting serious, I didn't think it would be nearly this bad though.

Her dad is like the FIL from hell, he can be nice to your face but drag you down behind your back. He uses her and her mom as an emotional punching bag. 
He on multiple occasions has kicked her mother out over things that have happened in the past to try and ""fix her"" and to show her that she used to be a good person also that she used to have nothing before him and she was a way better person before hand so this will make things better. 

He's kicked her out in the middle of winter with the dog in -25 weather. I should reference that Alexis and I live together and we live a hour away. When we heard her mother was kicked out we rushed down there to pick her up off the side of the road before she got to cold. Her mother is so manipulated that she believes she deserves this. 
She stayed with us for a day and 1 night.  That morning we woke up and she had left us a note saying she was going home and that she was sorry for leaving the dog with us. He had convinced her to start walking home to prove she wanted to stay in the relationship and ""do the right thing"" Let me remind you we live a hour away and it was in the dead of winter. I hopped in my truck and drove over 15 mins before I found her walking. She said she wanted to go home so I met up with him and he somewhat scolded me for helping her. Said I shouldn't have picked her up and that she should have walked. Also that I shouldn't have picked her up in the first place. I told him you dont leave someone you love out in the cold. You can't kick some one out of a house they helped pay for. He told me shes done more harm then good to him and Alexis and she deserves it. I knew right then and there this man was absolutely bat sh*t crazy. 

On other occasions he has made her write out a letter detailing all that he has done wrong. Mostly money issues and not having her husband's ""back"" in certain occasions that he has put him self in. All very minor things in Alexis and my opinions. He made her hand deliver this letter to everyone in the family, stand there and tell them this is the truth. This is the same family who is extremely distant from them due to them not agreeing with how he is with her. They think they're both crazy the letter just proved it. 

On Alexis's last birthday, her father told her he was going to cut her off if she didnt move back in with them. She had left and moved in with me due to there actions. When she moved in with me I had already had a very good taste of how her parents were and i told her that there negative energy is staying there and i dont want any of that to come with her. She is currently in university and is buried in school work, her father does not care for this and says she still needs to be there for her family when times get rough. When he starts fights and starts to upset them with his actions he expects her to drop everything and adhere to his requests. This simply isnt even remotely possible with her schooling. Its easy for him to say when its his own doing. 

When she said she was not coming back on her birthday her mother knew that shit was about to hit the fan so she left the house and stayed with a close friend.
She said he was done with him and there relationship for now and needed space from him.  When he came home to a empty house he flew into a sea of emotion and attempted to call Alexis to try and find out where her mother went. He cut off her phone so she got new phone plan and a new number. I told her this might be a good thing to leave them for awhile and focus on our own lives instead of being swallowed up by them. She ended up feeling guilty and called him to check on him since she knew what was going to happen. 

 He pleaded to her to talk to him and get her mother to call him. He harassed her for over 2 weeks to try and get her to deal with him and Alexis continued to let him control her and she dealt with him over this period of time. She did hold some boundaries with him, like not going back to the house and meeting in public, and she called him out for his sh*tty behaviour during their conversations; including asking him if he’d even be talking to her right now if her mother hadn’t left. It was absolutely brutal hearing him complain to her about everything that has happened over the years and how everything went to wrong. Again his own doing. 


Her mother changed her phone number and was moving on trying to work through this time in her life, eventually she ended up feeling sorry for him and ended up calling him and one thing led to another and she ended up going home to him. He vowed that he would never treat her like that again and they need to focus on bigger things in there life. She took his word for it, 2 weeks ago things started happening again. He started talking like he used to about how everything is her fault and that Alexis left because of her etc. Relating things like the chimney not being cleaned to Alexis’ mother failing as a parent and claiming that Alexis doesn’t know the meaning of family. 

Her mother is an amazing person if i haven't said that yet. Whenever I used to go see her before she moved in with me she used to send me home with leftovers or make me coffee for the road as at that time i was working long hours and nights. He told her she was being to nice to me to soon. Accused her of emotional cheating on him with me due to this because she wouldn't stop being nice to me. Eventually she ended up texting me saying I wasn't aloud coming around anymore due to this something he made her think she had to do. This is just another instance of there craziness. 

Things like this happen every 4-6 months. Its like clock work. You can almost sense it in the air when something its going to go from somewhat okay to absolutely diabolical. This has been the normal ever since she was a little girl. One time her mother pissed off her dad enough for him to kick her out. Did I mention she gets kicked out alot? Her mother went outside and was crying in the ditch down to road form her house. He took Alexis out there and said ""look at that snake in the ditch Alexis"" it was her mother crouching down in the ditch absolutely balling her eyes Out. Insane right? Or is it just me? 

This is just a drop in the bucket of things that have happened i could literally go on for days of this. 

Something I referenced earlier was I told her when she moved in with me I didnt want this coming to my house now ours at the time. Alexis has apologized many times for this stuff following her here. I know she feels guilty for not being there for her parents and has expressed that “she can’t get that time back”.

We have gone from 0 to 100 when her mother stayed with us. After her mother left in the summer and ended up going back I asked Alexis that if/ most definitely when things get crazy with them again we have to either cut them off or go extremely low contact. At the time she agreed with me saying its getting ridiculous. I was glad to hear her say that as this has been happening ever since she can remember. 

Since this recent incident has started happening I reminded her of our discussion and she seemed to go back on it saying it’s not that bad. I said to her its not that bad to you since this has been happening all your life. This is not normal and not healthy for us to go through this all the time. Since she is going back on what we agreed on I have done some self reflection on this and im having a hard time dealing with this. I love her and I want things to work out but her and her parents issues have been wearing me down. Its the most stressful thing I have gone through in my life. I have been cheated on multiple times by the same girl and kept on going back I have also lost one of my best friends over that to. I have had my fair share of toxic family as well and have cut them off and never looked back. I would rather go through those 2x over then this once. 

I dont want to deal with this until her parents either die or maybe change? I ended up telling her last night that things aren't going to change so we have to. We have to either cut them off or I have to move on with my life as I cannot deal with this anymore. I know Alexis feels like I’m forcing her to make a choice between people she loves and I don’t want her to feel that way; I explained that I’m not forcing her, that I’m just making a choice for myself.

She ended up crying and we hugged and talked about it some more and the consensus is we're going to let things pan out and see how it goes. I have heard this story before I told her this on the many occasions this has happened.  
Alexis expressed a lot of guilt about the idea of cutting her family off, she is an only child if I hadn’t mentioned that already. She also expressed concerns about cutting them off to protect our relationship and then what if we don’t work out? What then? I can understand her concerns, we’re not married, just dating and living together. But I reassured her that we are fine, and if we weren’t id still help her land on her feet. Alexis also said she doesn’t know if there is ever any coming back from no contact, her father is a very petty and spiteful man and she’s terrified that she’ll never have him or her mother in her life again if she cuts them off even for a bit; that the damage will be irreparable. 

She wanted me to add that she feels differently about cutting people off that I do, she knows I’ve cut off family before, specifically my aunt. She says it’s not as easy as I make it out to be and it’s extremely hard for her. 

Im conflicted on what to do. What I know is that I am exhausted of this.
TL;DR: I (25M) have been with my girlfriend (21F) for 3 years. Her father is emotionally abusive, controlling, and manipulates both my girlfriend and her mother. He regularly kicks her mom out of the house; even in dangerous weather; forces her to confess to “sins,” isolates her, uses guilt/duty to pull my girlfriend back in, and creates constant chaos every few months. This dysfunction keeps spilling into our relationship despite my boundaries. I’m exhausted and told my girlfriend I can’t keep doing this unless she goes low/no contact. She’s terrified of losing her parents forever and is struggling with guilt. I love her, but I’m at a breaking point and need advice.",3,1763660964.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False

Our office put up an anonymous suggestion box as part of a “culture improvement initiative.”

People usually leave mild things like “Better snacks” or “Fix the AC.”

Not my coworker Trent.

Apparently he thought “anonymous” meant he was anonymous but he could absolutely name-drop everyone else.

His suggestions included:

“Please tell MARK to stop clicking his pen like an office woodpecker.”

“Can someone tell JESSICA she doesn’t have to narrate her emails out loud?”

“Whoever microwaved fish: I know it was you, LUCAS. Stop it.”

“Let’s get a second coffee machine so people don’t have to smell TODD’S protein shakes anymore.”

And the kicker:

“WHY DOES SARAH RUN LIKE THAT.”

Management read them at the meeting. Aloud. Every single one.

You could see Trent deflate as each named coworker slowly turned to look at him.

When they said the running one, Sarah just whispered:

“…What the hell does that mean?”

Is this normal? Is it because it’s a cleaning cycle? I’m excited because it actually made the coffee. It’s not as loud when brewing a pod but this caught me by surprise because it’s a brand new machine. Has anyone else experienced this? ",0,1763660861.0,nespresso,0,0.5,False

I was feeling sick and I wanted a light fruit bowl for dinner that night and I suggested we go to the grocery store that sells warm food and fruit bowls sandwiches ect.  So after asking him if he wanted to go there for dinner he's been asking do you need groceries or like I'm headed to the store do you need anything? And it just dawned on me that it's kinda weird that he would be so open to help me out but I was like why he always mentions the store or if I need anything.

Recently he has just started whining like crazy (like standing at my legs and just whining but doesn't want to be held??), scream crying when i have to leave him in the playpen to go to the bathroom, and sleeping restlessly. 

He also has no interest in toys, he just wants me to read books to him, which is great! But i suspect its because he's getting more direct attention with books rather than his toys. This child is acting attention starved but like, he gets 90% of my attention. I do try to enjoy a solitary cup of coffee while he eats breakfast. We are in the livingroom together, but i am watching the news and not directly playing with him for like an hour first thing in the morning.

A couple weeks ago i tried to start sleep training him (way too late i know), but he got sick so i kept him in our bed. The newly resurfaced attachment happened at about 8 months as well but he seems worse this time around. 

How should i be handling it? Is this a normal time for him to be experiencing this? 

Could it be because the sleep training made him scared i would leave him? I did ferber just one day, but he was crying so hard i thought he would barf and i just can't let him cry like that alone. If he was just whining or crying lightly i would see if he would settle down, but i won't let him be super distressed alone. Other than that one day i would soothe until he fell alseep and then return as needed. 

I'm looking into getting a better recliner for me in his room before i pick sleep training back up. 

Anyway. This is pretty uncharacteristic for him, even for when he is teething which he is currently. Three eye teeth and a molar are erupting. 

I just need a little advice on how to get *us* through this. He's just a little crab apple lately.

He also recently figured out how to scream like a pterodactyl, which is super fun. ",2,1763660478.0,Mommit,3,1.0,False

For context, I am in an open/poly relationship and I have a primary partner. However, we spend very little time together between work and other family obligations. If this makes you uncomfortable, it won’t be the vibe. 

However, if you’re still interested in a 5’9”, curvy blonde MILF type, here’s what you can expect - I’m open and friendly, experienced in a lot of areas but totally new to the dating scene.

I am looking for someone who wants to have fun and go with the flow. Your age/height/relationship status/living arrangement/job are all things I’m interested in but aren’t deal breakers. If you live alone and could do anime and cuddle nights, that would be fantastic. I don’t want to text - I want to meet. Coffee, boba, cocktails? Love them. Lunch or dinner? Perfect. There is more (including pics) in my pinned profile comment, because I can’t seem to add them to this post. I’d like to see you in return. 

I really hope there is someone out there who can match my energy. I’m pretty lonely these days, and it sucks feeling alone even when you’re surrounded by people. Maybe you understand?

We have a lawyer that’s using one of the offices right now and that’s a good fit too. They’re quiet and respectful (and sometimes seems to be a therapist for their clients too, lol). I just want to avoid having, like a general contractor or something like that (no offense, I’m friends with a GC; I’m just worried about it being disruptive to the therapists/lawyer)

Anyway, I fear I’m rambling, the short version is  I’m not a big business so I can’t list it in any serious places, the small places don’t like you posting offices, and we’re wanting to target one-on-one type professionals. I’m not really sure where to post it. I tried Facebook, but it’s really geared towards residential rentals. So I’m getting spammed with people that want to live in it (yikes)

Being able to post it online would be cool, but I’m actually wondering about local places. Like are there events where I could meet the therapists, or massage therapists, lawyers, etc. who are just starting out and can’t afford a whole building? I know sometimes coffee shops will have billboards and stuff like that or people share business cards. Is that kind of thing actually effective?

So I kind of made my peace with it being a chemical as the lines were super faint and I started bleeding like a heavier than normal period on Friday, 15 Nov. I tested on the 17th to see if my hCG has gone down to zero and the line came out darker than before. My hCG was too low to even consider an ultrasound, so I contacted my OB, who advised to go to the ER right away, just for peace of mind. I had 3 doctors and 2 nurses participating in the ultrasound there, but it showed nothing, of course. My hCG came back at 90, where it was 26.4 3 days before I started bleeding (12 Nov). Now they’re monitoring me, at first they thought I miscarried and just had remaining tissue producing hCG still, but also my pelvic exam showed I had almost no blood left in my uterus, and my endometrium was 4.4mm. Corpus luteum visible on the left side, where I ovulated from on CD12. I returned to the hospital to run betas as per their request today, exactly 48h later and they came back at 210. They’re puzzled, wondering if I could have somehow ovulated again after my initial ovulation, and this could be a second pregnancy, but I’m fearing it’s ectopic. I’m still very lightly spotting brown and like coffee grounds residue. I’m going back on Monday, and they’re hoping that if my hCG is going up at this rate it is, they’ll be able to see something, but obvs in the meantime, idk what to do with myself or what to think. I have no pains anywhere, except some discomfort on the side where corpus luteum is, but I always do while it’s there. I also have never, to my record, ovulated from the left, so idk what to expect from that side. Nver had an ectopic before, but did lose 2 pregnancies 2 years ago. CP in Feb earlier this year.

While grabbing coffees & breakfast at the Tim Hortons on the morning of the 18th, a woman snatched my FIL's phone off the table and also tried to snatch my MIL's bag and run out the door. 

I wasn't there, but I heard my MIL fought to keep the bag but eventually had to let go. As the thief fled, the tug-of-war having slowed her down enough that my FIL was able to catch up and stop her outside the restaurant and eventually wrestle the phone away from her after a pretty sordid scuffle involving some hair pulling, and her scratching the s**t out of his face. 

I understand there were a few people standing by who had his back and may have stepped in at some point? There were people who assisted in locating her after she fled without the phone, and made sure police were called and provided witness statements. (The police were also apparently very friendly, supportive, and helpful)

I just wanted to send out a heartfelt thank you to all the wonderful people who stepped in to help out in that situation. While they're in their 70's, my inlaws are true east coasters and tough old birds - so they'll eventually shake it off and make a good story of it. All the same, it was a little traumatizing for them, especially for my MIL as it was her first time in Toronto. 

I tried to explain that while this isn't entirely common as an experience (I've lived here for many years now and I've never had anything like this happen) it's still a big city and incidents like this are definitely going to happen more frequently.

Hey everyone,

I’m a solo founder, trying to get my new SaaS product, off the ground. We’re in the productivity space. Our competitor is a massive in this space. Their marketing budget for a *week* is my entire runway for a year.

I felt sick looking at their feature list. They had everything. We were constantly playing catch-up, burning time and money trying to guess what they’d do next.

A few weeks ago, I was having a major crisis of confidence. We were about to launch a new version, and I was terrified that my competitor would instantly crush it with a superior feature. I joked to my friends, ""We need a competitive spy who can tell us what they're *actually* missing, not just what they have.""

That’s when I stumbled across **GapsFinder.com**. The homepage looked almost too simple: ""Beat Competition Before They Wake Up."" Skeptical, but desperate, I decided to take the $1 Starter package.

1. **My website:** myurl.`com`
2. **Competitor:** `competitorurl .com`

I hit ""Start Analysis."" While I was pouring a coffee, the analysis was done.

I opened the report. It wasn't just a basic feature matrix. It used multiple LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity) to compare our apps

**The ""Aha!"" Moment:**

My competitor big marketing push was around **""Deep Work""**. But the analysis highlighted a **CRITICAL GAP (Impact Score 95)**:

>**#1 FOCUS MODE FRAGMENTED** *Effort: 70/100* Competitor requires users to manually set four different preferences (notification blocker, screen dimmer, app blocker, and soundscape) to enter ""Deep Work."" GapsFinder suggests a single-click, **AI-driven preset** based on the user's *calendar events* (e.g., ""Meeting Prep Mode"").

The competitor, had over-engineered their ""killer feature"" and made it clumsy. My $1 analysis showed me the exact, high-impact feature they missed: **AI-Powered ""One-Click"" Focus Presets.**

The result? Our conversion rate jumped **20%** in the first week. We didn't need to match their 50 features; we just needed to fix their one, high-impact mistake.

I’m an Uber driver from Puerto Rico and honestly… I've noticed tourists keep getting sent to the same 3–4 places over and over.

PR has SO MUCH to offer so I decided to embark on a mission... and built a website that I can share to my Uber riders everytime they ask:

[BestPlacesPuertoRico.com](http://bestplacespuertorico.com/)

Still tweaking things, would love feedback.

Some examples of the type of things I’m adding:

* Calendar with upcoming local/cultural festivals, events, etc.
* Beaches without crowds
* Best coffee that I know of
* Food spots that are super delicious without being overpriced

The idea is to support small local business owners and give them a chance to been seen by travelers.

\- Everything is within Uber distance since Uber doesn't work well outside San Juan and most of the tourists don't rent transportation.

Want some thoughts,"I have a 16 quart stock pot, and will be making a giant batch of chili. My normal chili recipe is a little hot for this crowd, so I wanted something flavorful but not spicy. Here's the ingredient list:

3 pounds red kidney beans (dry)

8 pounds beef

1 pound chicken livers (run through food processor before adding)

4 yellow onions

6 bell peppers

8 cloves garlic

4 cans crushed tomatoes 

2 cans diced tomatoes 

1 12 oz can tomato paste

8 cups beef broth 

2 cups brewed coffee 

1 cup dark beer

1/2 cup mild chili powder (ancho based)

1/4 cup cumin

2 tbsp paprika 

2 tbsp cocoa powder 

1 tbsp garlic powder 

1 tbsp onion powder

2 tsp ground coriander 

Salt to taste

Black pepper to taste

2 bay leaves

2 tbsp Worcestershire 

1 tbsp soy sauce

2 tbsp brown sugar 

1/2 cup corn flour (to thicken)

Looking at the ingredient list, it seems pretty great. Since I'm making a ton, I want to make sure there isn't something in here that will be massively polarizing that will result in me eating all of it myself over the next two weeks. The only potentially polarizing ingredient in here I've tried in a chili before is liver, which I was successful in hiding/blending into the chili. Beyond that, a lot of this is new to me.

Ectopic ?","I had a very, very faint line on 13dpo pm and virtually no progression. So I kind of made my peace with it being a chemical as the lines were super faint and I started bleeding like a heavier than normal period on Friday, 15 Nov. I tested on the 17th to see if my hCG has gone down to zero and the line came out darker than before. My hCG was too low to even consider an ultrasound, so I contacted my OB, who advised to go to the ER right away, just for peace of mind. I had 3 doctors and 2 nurses participating in the ultrasound there, but it showed nothing, of course. My hCG came back at 90, where it was 26.4 3 days before I started bleeding (12 Nov). Now they’re monitoring me, at first they thought I miscarried and just had remaining tissue producing hCG still, but also my pelvic exam showed I had almost no blood left in my uterus, and my endometrium was 4.4mm. Corpus luteum visible on the left side, where I ovulated from on CD12. I returned to the hospital to run betas as per their request today, exactly 48h later and they came back at 210. They’re puzzled, wondering if I could have somehow ovulated again after my initial ovulation, and this could be a second pregnancy, but I’m fearing it’s ectopic. I’m still very lightly spotting brown and like coffee grounds residue. I’m going back on Monday, and they’re hoping that if my hCG is going up at this rate it is, they’ll be able to see something, but obvs in the meantime,  idk what to do with myself or what to think. I have no pains anywhere, except some discomfort on the side where corpus luteum is, but I always do while it’s there. I also have never, to my record, ovulated from the left, so idk what to expect from that side. Nver had an ectopic before, but did lose 2 pregnancies 2 years ago. CP in Feb earlier this year.

Idk what my question is, but I welcome your comments and thoughts.  My line progression can be seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/8sOOVZ3).

Horrible cruel treatment towards me, need advice?","been with my fiance for 2 years. I found out in August this year that he had been cheating on me since June. I didnt know the extent of it until September. He found her on a dating app, shes 44 years old, hes 35 and I’m 33. They had been talking every single day since June and started seeing each other consistently in July. I even found out that the new paintball team member he was playing with every weekend who was 17 years old, whom he would send me pictures of them together all the time, was actually her son. 

In August we got into a huge argument because I found a box of condoms in his truck, we didnt use condoms. He lied saying they were for us because he wanted to practice safer sex. I immediately knew he was lying. He got physical with me that night, I rushed towards him because I was so upset yelling at him, and he shoved me so hard 3 separate times that I went flying across his apartment and smacked my entire body on his hardwood floor face down, he shoved me again and I flew over his couch I literally saw stars. Then we got into a pushing match and he held me in a choke hold on the floor, laying on his back and I was on my back on top of him.

He said I couldnt come to his apartment anymore because the neighbors complained about the loud yelling. About a week later, I came over to talk about things and he was getting ready to go on a date. He told me he was about to go to the laundry mat and that the laundry mat was “super busy” at like 6 pm, something in my gut told me he was lying so I showed up unnanounced. He freaked out and said he was going out with the boys to the bar. I said no you’re not. He said fine, I’m going on a date. I begged him not to go, he walked out to his car and I got into his passenger seat. He came around and scooped me out of the car and we both fell onto the pavement. I walked back to my car crying and he came to my window and said “If you’re still here when I get back I’ll call the cops. If we’re meant to be together then we will be.” 

He said he only saw her once after that night, but turns out she said that was like their 20th date. He told me he left her in the movie theater that night because he felt so guilty and immediately tried to call me. That was also a lie, because she said she went home with him that night, they slept together and stayed in bed drinking coffee all morning (found this out days later). 

I woke up to an email from him the next day saying he was so sorry, that he needs me, loves me and made a huge mistake. I took him back. He told me the name of the woman he was seeing and I found her social media. I asked her how long he’d been sleeping with her and she told me “multiple times a week since July” she didnt know about me, he told her I was a crazy ex and that we broke up a year ago. Not true. The entire month of September she said he told her they were exclusive but that was a lie because we were obviously still seeing each other too, although he said he was “busy” more and barely put any effort into our relationship, it became more just about sex for him and no emotion. After he found out me and her had been talking, he “chose” me and said he’d stop talking to her. This was in October. That weekend I went over to his place for a few days and he made comments like “Dont start arguing with me, dont make me regret my decision.” I was so mad. 

He made so many backhanded comments blaming me for his cheating, saying he was unhappy and thats why he cheated, telling me details about their sex life - how she gave him better sex, how she felt better and tasted better, how she gave him massages, was more sensual, and how she touched him lovingly and tenderly unlike me. We got into 3 arguments about the affair that weekend, he would flip from crying in my lap saying how sorry he was, how it should have never happened, to being angry that I kept bringing it up. At 2 am when he was sleeping right next to me, he texted her saying “we got into a fight again, I think I made the wrong choice. can I see you again?” She said she’d tell me he said that, so when I woke up he confessed to sending her that text. I called her on his phone and begged her to block him and she refused saying she feels like he has more to say to her and that she feels like the victim in all of this. 

He promised me he wouldnt talk to her anymore, I told him if he does we’re over. A couple days later, I asked her if he was still talking to her, she said yes. He denied it. When I confronted him that she said they were, he says “I asked her to meet up with me tomorrow, I need to know if I’m making the right choice. I dont want to regret this for years. I’m sorry it sucks but its true.” I told him we’re over and he said “Ok I wish you the best.” A week later, he sends me 24 text messages proclaiming his love for me, that he “made a mistake and that we’re soulmates, saying she isnt my person, you are a part of my soul. I’m coming over right now to pick you up (at 6 am) to get my heart and soul. I love you too much to keep effing this up.”

I got into his car and he was super sexual with me immediately. Making out with me, etc. I was like what is going on? He told me she was just using him, seeing other guys and just wanted to “win”. She called him while we were in the car talking about this. I knew something wasnt right. We got to his place and he started acting really shady, pacing around and acting agitated. He told me he needed to take the call, he goes outside in the hallway, I open the door and see him texting her. He comes back inside and says “This was a mistake. We need to go now. It was a misunderstanding, she says she wants me and only me.” I said what is a misunderstanding?? He said “she saw me on bumble the other day but his profile was on snooze.” Bull. I know he was on the dating apps still cuz he said he saw me on there too while we were talking in the car.

He said “Get your stuff now. I need to take you back home.” I asked him if she was telling him to do that and he said yes. Unbeknownst to me, he started recording our conversation for her on his phone. We get into his truck and he said (while recording for her) “I want to be with you but I want to be with her more.” I said “Are you so smitten by her that you’re willing to throw away our love after 2 years?” he said “Yes.” I said “You dont have a future with her. She already has 3 grown kids. What are you gonna do? Have a baby with her and when the kid is 5 she’ll be 50?” he said “Maybe!” I was crying and heartbroken. He was furiously texting her the entire time, and took a picture of the freeway for her to prove he was driving me home. I said “can you please stop texting her the entire drive home out of respect for me?” He said “Yeah one sec.” and continued to do it the entire 40 min drive.

I said “What about the 24 text messages saying we were soulmates and that she wasnt your person??” He said “I thought I meant it but I dont know now.” I said “I loved you with my entire soul. I cant believe you’re doing this to me.” He said “Do you really mean that?” I said “Yes!” I got out of his car, he grabbed his gnomes that he kept in my front yard and left. I didnt hear from him for a week again, I contacted him to come get his stuff he left in my garage. He said he thinks about me every night, that he’s still in love with me. I asked him if he’s really happier with her and he said hes not happy. I told her all of this and she didnt believe me, she said next time record the call or I wont consider it. She started getting really rude with me so I just said whatever, you can have him, hes a habitual liar. 

He even lied to her in a group chat between the 3 of us saying he never kissed me or did anything sexual with me in the truck that day he picked me up. Literally lied to my face for her when he knew what really happened (more than kissing). Then, he told me he got a new promotion at work and is making a lot more money now and she was going to take him out this past monday to celebrate. Well, that was a lie too because she told me no, monday was her birthday and he was taking her out. She said they’re going to see each other every thursday and friday for the forseeable future. He said in the group chat, “I’m sorry I hurt you, I feel guilty, I do care about you but I care about her too and need to see if its real. I’ll let you know one way or another.”

I saw so many pictures, naked pics of her etc on his secret phone that I didnt even know he had. He would send me the same naked pictures of himself to both of us. I saw the loving texts her sent her saying he wanted to be in bed with her rubbing her back again, how amazing and perfect she is, etc. He told me he “loves us both and wants to be with both of us.” He would have sex with both of us on the same day sometimes. For months he would see her on saturday and me on sunday. I am disgusted.

He didnt do anything for our 2 year anniversary in August. I asked him if he got me flowers, he laughed and said yeah they’re at the store. Yet when she left him for a few days after finding out about me, he sent her a huge bouqet of flowers to her door.

A couple months ago he lied and told me he went to the mountains with his guy friend, said there wouldnt be service there so he couldnt use his phone. Called me that morning and said his guy friend was about to be there and that he loved me. Turns out he actually took her to the mountains that entire weekend. I have blocked both of them. It seems like he just assumed I would always be there waiting for him whenever he gets done with her. The way he treated me was so horrible and heartbreaking. I dont understand it. He went from someone that loved me to such a cruel person. I need some advice please?

TLDR; Cheated on for 3 months straight after 2 years together. He fell in love with both of us. So many lies. He was extremely cruel to me and still kept saying he was in love with me. She is 44, he is 35. I am 33.

Chapter 1

I want a divorce.

Everyone around me says I've lost my mind.

Julian Croft comes from a good family, he's rich, and he's a family man. They say I'm a housewife who doesn't appreciate the good life she has, and if I insist on a divorce, I'll live to regret it.

Yeah, I am crazy.

The moment I saw him carrying his first love's handbag, I went crazy.

...

I’d begged my husband for that bag for months, but he never bought it for me.

But this morning, I saw it on the arm of Julian's divorced first love, Zoe Miles.

There’s no way she could afford it herself — the answer was obvious.

That night, I asked him, ""Did you give Zoe that bag she's carrying?""

Julian had just gotten back from the research institute, looking tired. Without looking up, he said, ""Yeah.""

Short. Flat.

No explanation. No hint of guilt. As if giving a gift to another woman was a perfectly normal thing to do.

I continued, ""Are you two back together?""

That finally got a reaction out of Julian.

He frowned and looked up, ""Chloe Evans, is that all you can think about?

You see a bag and jump straight to cheating?""

That's just how Julian is. He never talks properly, always frowning and questioning me back.

I'd ask him if he wanted breakfast, and he'd reply, ""What do you think?""

I'd try to be intimate with him, and he'd push me away, ""Don't you know I'm exhausted?""

It's torture.

With me, it seems like he can never just speak normally.

But with other people, he's different.

As the head of a pharmaceutical company and a research and development engineer, Julian.

He's eloquent with his business partners, and warm and caring with our child and his family.

And with Zoe, he's even more different. When he talks to her, even his eyes are smiling.

Thinking about all this, I suddenly felt like it was all pointless.

I sighed, ""Let's get a divorce. I don't want this anymore.""

He glanced at me, didn't answer, and turned to go into the bathroom.

A few moments later, the family group chat exploded.

My mom sent a barrage of sixty-second voice messages, all filled with harsh words.

""Chloe, have you lost your mind?

You have a perfectly good life as a wealthy housewife and you're throwing it away. If you dare to get a divorce, I'll...""

I clicked on one of them and turned it off halfway through.

I was sick of hearing it, tired of it all.

I went straight to the City Hall app and scheduled an appointment for a divorce.

Actually, I should have done this a long time ago.

A husband who only ever sides with another woman.

What do I need him for?

I wiped my eyes and glanced at the sound of the shower running in the bathroom.

I decided there was one more thing I had to do, something every woman does when she’s about to get divorced. Something important.

I grabbed my car keys, headed straight for the underground garage, wiped away my tears, and opened the driver's side door.

Usually, my daughter sits in her car seat, and I sit in the back with her.

The passenger seat has been empty for years. The ""Mrs. Croft's Exclusive Seat"" sticker I put on the center console has turned yellow and is peeling at the edges.

This sticker has been with me from the Audi A8L to the Range Rover.

I've actually been through tough times with Julian.

A month after we got married, Daniel Croft was kicked off the board for manipulating stock prices and banned from the securities market for life.

He was on the verge of bankruptcy, his cash flow dried up, and the Croft family mansion was almost repossessed by the bank.

With my encouragement, Julian, who had started his own business away from the family, managed to avoid this family disaster.



Later, we used the money we'd saved over several years to stop the family's downfall.

To be honest, those two years when we had nothing were the happiest, but we can never go back.

I accidentally flipped down the sun visor above me, and a huge surprise stared back at me from its mirror.

On the mirror.

There were two hearts drawn in lipstick, the kind pierced by a single arrow.


Chapter 2

I knew at a glance that Zoe had drawn it.

Tea Rose Lipstick Shade 274, the color Zoe always used.

The mark looked jarringly bright. I was about to wipe it off with a tissue when Julian grabbed my hand.

Julian had just showered. His bangs were wet, and a drop of water landed on my hand, cold.

He looked at me coldly. ""What are you doing in my car?""

I pointed to the lipstick mark on the mirror. ""Zoe's?""

""Yeah.""

Julian answered nonchalantly.

He still didn't explain, just frowned and said, ""Don't touch anything in my car. Get out.""

I shook off Julian's hand and sat firmly, not moving. ""Your car?

I'll correct you. This was bought with our shared assets, so I have the right to use it.""

""Don't worry, I won't want this car after the divorce.""

It's tainted.

Julian sneered, ""Fine. Let's get a divorce.""

Then he opened the back door and took out a red velvet box.

I froze for a second, feeling like I'd seen it before.

Before I could think more about it, Julian came back around to the side of the car, staring at me with an unreadable expression.

""Didn't you want a divorce?

Let's go. We can go back and discuss the terms.""

He tossed the words out lightly and turned away coldly.

Staring at his cold back, my heart felt heavy, like it was weighed down by a giant stone.

Seven years of marriage, sharing the same bed, and he couldn't even be bothered to show a hint of reluctance.

My restraint seemed utterly ridiculous.

I looked down at my watch. It was still early, enough time to go do that thing later.

Then I followed Julian upstairs, one right after the other.

When we got back to our front door, I found an unwelcome guest.

And holding her hand was my daughter, Cindy​.

Zoe's long, black, curly hair fell naturally. Standing there, she looked every bit the cool, stunning beauty.

It was hard to tell she had just crawled out of a bloody divorce.

When she saw Julian, she smiled brightly and said sweetly.

""Cindy​ called me and said she wasn't feeling well, so I picked her up from her after-school class. I forgot to tell you.""

""Thanks for the trouble.""

He then looked down and gave his daughter a slight glare. ""Don't bother Aunt Miles next time. If you need something, go to your mom.""

Cindy​ pouted, glanced sideways at me, and hid behind Zoe. ""I don't want to go to Mom!

Mom always makes me do things I don't like, she won't let me eat sweets, she won't let me eat strawberries...""

My daughter spoke with such indignation. When did she become like this?

I had thought about it seriously for a long time, and I'd even labeled this behavior a rebellious streak.

But I don't want to think about it anymore. It's meaningless.

And I no longer patiently explained to her like I used to, ""It's because you're getting cavities, you can't eat sweets, and you're allergic to strawberries. That's why Mom doesn't let you eat them.""

I took a step forward, about to open the door and go inside.

But my daughter suddenly jumped out from behind Zoe, raised her little pink fists, and slammed them into my leg.

""Bad mommy!""

I stood there, staring at her crying and shouting face, silently enduring her anger and her blows.

Until Julian picked her up to comfort her.

""Don't be angry anymore, Cindy​. Daddy will take you to buy candy.""

After calming his daughter down, he shot me a look. The silence spoke volumes.

My daughter had one arm wrapped around his neck and was holding Zoe's hand with the other.



""Aunt, will you and Dad take me to get candy by your school again, okay?""

I frowned slightly as an invisible hand gripped my heart, then abruptly let go, the feeling scattering to the wind.

Before Julian could look at me, I unlocked the front door.

I didn't give the father and daughter a single glance. ""I'll have the papers drawn up for you to review when you get back.""

I opened the door and went inside by myself.

I was going to ask my daughter if she wanted to be with her dad or her mom.

Now there was no need to ask. I already had my answer.

I didn't want her, either.


Chapter 3

8 PM.

Julian came home with our daughter.

Soon after, I heard the TV turn on and the fridge door slam open as she started rummaging for snacks.

These bad habits will affect her teeth and eyesight.

I only ever wanted her to grow up healthy and beautiful. That’s why I was so strict.

But in the end, all I got was the heartbreaking label of 'bad mom,' so now I won't interfere with her anymore.

A moment later, the door was pushed open.

My daughter ran in, stood by my bed, tugged at my blanket, and shouted.

""Why didn't you run my bath? Cindy​ wants a milk bubble bath today...""

I held the corner of the blanket down. ""I'm tired. Go find your dad.""

She wouldn't listen, grabbing my hand and trying to pull me out of bed.

""Dad's been busy and tired from work all day. You don't do anything at home, so I want you to give me my bath!""

Her words made my chest tighten.

The words ""Who taught you to say that?"" almost slipped out, but I swallowed them back down.

I sat up, and when my eyes fell on the divorce agreement clutched in her hand, the words caught in my throat.

She had drawn a cartoon of a family of three on the paper.

On the left, she was holding Julian's hand, and on the right, she was holding the hand of a woman with long, black, curly hair.

I didn’t have to ask who she was. Zoe.

My daughter tilted her head up slightly, looking at me sideways, like I was a pathetic, drowned rat.

""Dad told Cindy​ to draw on it. He said if you don't behave, he'll punish you and not let you be my mom anymore!""

I let out a cold sneer. ""Is that so?""

My heart grew even colder.

Julian walked in just then, drying his hair, ignoring our daughter's disrespect towards me.

He spoke to me in his usual commanding tone, ""I have a business trip in a couple of days. Pack my bags for me.""

I didn't move, saying flatly, ""I'm being serious about divorcing you.""

Julian was clearly taken aback for a moment.

His cool gaze landed on me, searching, then it turned to impatience.

""Isn't it just about a bag?

I'll transfer you the money, go buy it yourself.""

My WhatsApp pinged, and a transfer for 200 appeared on my screen.

My eyes stung, and then I laughed.

Julian is very rich, so rich that his spending is measured in the tens of thousands.

But he tried to brush me off with 200.

I accepted the transfer, sent back 191, and when I looked up, my eyes were cold.

""The document processing fee for a divorce is only 9. Let's divide the rest of the assets when we divorce.""

He scoffed as if he'd heard a bad joke. ""A divorce? Are you sure?""

Our eyes met, and silence solidified between us.

""Mommy's not listening, Daddy, punish her!""

My daughter grabbed Julian's arm and started shaking it.

Julian coldly withdrew his gaze, picked up our daughter without a word, and left.

A moment later, I received a lawyer's business card from him, followed by just a few words—

[Talk to my lawyer.]

My breathing tightened. My finger hovered over the return key, the text box filled with blank space.

I wondered, is there a reset button for life?

After a long pause, I replied with a single word.

[Okay.]

I added his lawyer, explained my purpose.

By the next morning, my request was still pending. And last night, Julian had slept in the study.



When I came downstairs, he was in the bathroom, shaving in front of the mirror.

He's allergic to shaving foam, so I had someone buy him a foreign brand specifically for sensitive skin. It's almost empty now.

Seeing me, he paused for a moment, then discreetly put his phone on speaker and placed it on the sink.

""Mr. Croft, your wife added me on WhatsApp yesterday saying she wants a divorce. How should I handle it?""

Julian didn't even glance at me, just focused on a spot on his cheek he'd missed.

His tone was full of disdain and provocation.

""How to handle it?""

""I hired you to protect my interests. You tell me how to handle it.""

I watched him quietly, not saying a word.

When we were dating, I was watching a TV drama.

When the heroine was forced by her husband to walk away with no assets, I asked him.

""If, and I'm just saying if, we ever got divorced, would you do that to me too?""

He kissed my hair, his tone certain: ""There is no if. I'm going to grow old with you.""

I remember there was a light in his eyes when he said that.

My phone dinged.

His lawyer had accepted my friend request.

[Mrs. Croft, Mr. Croft has authorized me to handle all matters regarding your divorce. What are your terms?]

The moment I looked down, Julian walked past me with a cold expression.

My daughter's happy voice rang out.

""Daddy, I want to stay at Aunt's house for a long, long time this time!

Don't come pick me up too soon, okay?""

""Okay.""

I stood where I was, not moving, not looking back.

After the door clicked shut, I typed my reply to Julian's lawyer with my demands—

[Split the marital assets equally. I don't want custody of the child.]


Chapter 4

The moment I hit send, a screenshot came back almost instantly.

It was a chat log between him and Julian.

Julian: [Send this to her. If she wants a divorce, she won't get a single cent.]

My eyes burned with anger.

After seven years of marriage, I thought we'd at least have an amicable split.

I never thought it would end so disgracefully.

I locked my phone.

Once I calmed down, I opened my phone again and started looking for a good divorce lawyer.

After talking for a bit, the lawyer gave me some advice.

""Your husband has a high social standing. If public opinion turns against him, he’ll fold. I suggest you gather evidence of his affair with the mistress.""

Evidence... I had none.

On the surface, Julian had never crossed any lines.

A suffocating feeling, like I was drowning, washed over me. Everything around me was dead silent.

My daughter was at Zoe's house, and Julian wasn't home either.

I kept refreshing the divorce appointment queue on the City Hall app, my heart feeling like a stagnant pond.

Was I supposed to just walk away with no assets?

I couldn't accept that.

Just then, my best friend video-called me. The camera was shaking wildly.

But her furious voice came through crystal clear.

""Chloe, you’d better look at what your husband’s doing right now!""

The camera suddenly steadied, giving a perfect, unobstructed view of Julian and Zoe drinking wine with their arms linked.

Julian’s stomach was weak. He’d been hospitalized once for a bleeding ulcer.

He quit drinking after that.

He once told me, ""Nothing's more important than my health. If something happened to me, how would you live without me?""

But now, he was drinking wine with Zoe, his expression unchanged.

In the private room, even after they finished their wine, the client wouldn't let them off the hook.

""Come on, Mr. Croft. There’s still half a bottle left—wouldn’t want to waste it, right?""

Julian's expression soured for a second. Just as he was about to speak, Zoe snatched the half-full bottle.

""He has a bad stomach, I'll drink for him!""

She threw her head back and started chugging it down, finishing the half bottle in seconds.

She coughed, looking pitifully for mercy. ""Is that enough?""

The room went quiet for a moment.

The client clapped his hands and roared with laughter. ""Mr. Croft, you are one lucky man!""

""To have such a close female confidante in your life, a man could die happy!""

The corners of Zoe's eyes reddened as she said demurely, ""It's nothing, really. Compared to Mrs. Croft, what I do is so little, so insignificant.""

""Oh?""

""Is Mrs. Croft an even better drinker than Miss Miles?""

The client loved the drama and was happy to stir the pot.

""Mr. Croft, how about this? Call your wife over for a drink. The second she finishes it, this hundred-million-dollar deal is yours!""

Julian hesitated for a moment, then actually pulled out his phone.

The video cut off. Seconds later, my phone rang.

Julian's voice was cold. ""I'm giving you an out. Come to the Serendipity Pavilion right now, and I'll act like nothing happened.""

I looked at our wedding photo lying in the trash.

And coldly spat out a single word: ""No.""

Julian's breath hitched. He threatened in a low voice, ""Fine. Don't you regret this!""

Don't worry. I won't.

My best friend called again.

On the screen, Julian slammed his glass down on the table.

Zoe quickly grabbed his arm, shaking it with a pained look. ""Don't be angry. If she won't come, I'll drink for you...""

Before she could finish, my best friend couldn't hold back a curse. ""What a pair of scumbags!""

Julian heard the noise from the doorway and his eyes shot in that direction.



He noticed.

Julian stared hard at the camera, then grabbed Zoe's wrist, the one holding the wine glass.

""Want to watch?

Keep recording. Let her get a good look!""

He threw back a glass of wine and leaned down to kiss Zoe's lips.

Wine spilled from their kissing lips.

A sharp pain pierced my heart, then vanished, taking the last ache with it.

I hit the ""stop recording"" button.

I smiled, relieved, and sent the video to Julian's lawyer: ""Is this video worth half the assets?""

Julian's company had just gone public. If this blew up in the media, the losses would be incalculable.

A long time later, the lawyer replied with a single sentence.

[Mr. Croft agrees.]

The next second, a divorce agreement was sent to me.

I got what I wanted. I should have been happy.

But the dark screen only reflected my pale, tired face.

The TV, still on, cut to a travel ad.

""Feeling lost? Feeling tired?

At the end of the world, there's an island. Come on a journey to cleanse your soul.""

Iceland?

My heart stirred.

I'd rarely had any time to myself since getting married.

Maybe it was time to get away.

After booking a flight, I started to pack.

Halfway through packing, something made me pause for a long time.

It was the red velvet box Julian had taken from his car the day I asked for a divorce—

A man's wedding ring.


Chapter 5

Julian never liked wearing jewelry.

When I pestered him to get matching couple's rings, he refused: ""I don't like feeling constrained.""

But when he proposed, he chose a wedding ring.

Under the Sunrise spectacle on a snowy peak, we exchanged rings and kissed, as if we owned the world.

Afterward, I asked him, ""Didn't you say you don't like wearing rings?""

He kissed my ring, his eyes full of love and devotion.

""The mark this ring leaves is a testament to love. I'll never take this ring off.""

Back then, his eyes were filled with me.

But at some point, Julian stopped wearing his wedding ring.

It doesn't matter anymore.

Anyway, mine’s long gone too.

After that night, Julian didn't come back, and neither did my daughter.

The day I got my visa for Iceland, I received a package.

The sender's name was my daughter's.

I hesitated for a moment, but opened it anyway. Inside was the bag I'd always wanted—

An orange Hermès Kelly.

Along with it was a card in Zoe's handwriting.

""I heard you're divorcing Julian because of this bag. I'm giving it back to you, so stop throwing a tantrum.""

""By the way, Julian has just been with me these past few days taking care of Cindy​. You should try to make up with him.""

I tossed the card away, my face blank.

My heart was so dead I couldn't even feel upset.

I got rid of everything I could.

Our wedding photos with Julian, his and my matching down jackets, our matching mugs—I threw them all out.

Not long after the cleaner took away the big box of stuff, there was a noise at the door.

It was Julian and Zoe, walking in with my daughter held between them.

When my daughter saw me, she pulled her hands free, jumped onto the sofa, and started ordering me around.

""Get me some ice cream, and the teddy bear chocolate sandwich cookies...""

I ignored her.

I tried to leave with my suitcase, but Julian held it back, demanding, ""Where are you going?""

I said flatly, ""Going on a trip.""

Julian was about to say more, but Zoe cut in to stop him.

""Chloe is probably a little tired. Going out for a bit to relax is a good idea. It might be better to talk about things when she gets back.""

She turned to me again, ""Go ahead, don't worry about Cindy​. I'll take good care of her for you.""

Just as I was about to speak, Julian raised his voice, ""Where's your ring?""

I followed his gaze to my hand and answered, ""I lost it.""

Julian didn't seem to believe me. A flicker of doubt crossed his eyes, but his expression quickly went calm again.

""Come home soon.""

I smiled but didn't answer.

This isn't my home, and I'm not coming back.

I shut all the sounds behind the door.

I got into a taxi to the airport. After a day of flying, I landed on the other side of the world—

Iceland.

It's beautiful here, and so peaceful.

Away from the trivial matters of marriage and the noise of the city, my troubled heart finally found some peace.

One day, I was waiting for the Northern Lights with some fellow travelers.

Julian called me from a new number.

Thinking there was a change to the divorce agreement, I stepped aside to answer, but what I got was an annoyed complaint.

""Why haven't you come back?

When are you going to unblock me?""



I frowned as I opened the calendar: ""Ten more days.""

Ten more days until the divorce cooling-off period is over.

As for the block list, I never planned on unblocking him.

""Ten more days?""

His tone grew impatient, ""Don't forget who you are. You're the mother of our child, and you're my...""

""Chloe, the aurora is out! Quick, make a wish!""

My travel buddy's excited shout drowned out his words. I immediately put down my phone, closed my eyes, and made a wish.

May my future, on my own, be brilliant and bright.

...

Ten days later, I returned home.

After getting off the plane, I made a special trip to a salon to get styled.

In the mirror, I was wearing a simple white shirt, my makeup was flawless, and I looked fantastic.

For a moment, I thought I saw myself from seven years ago, bold and confident.

Then, I asked Julian to meet me at the coffee shop next to City Hall.

He was already there when I arrived.

He looked at me, a flash of awe on his face.

After his eyes followed me to my seat, his expression turned cold again.

""You can't do this again, just leaving whenever you feel like it. The house was a complete mess without you...""

The entitlement in his tone made it sound like he expected me to go back to just taking it all.

It was as if our ugly fight about the divorce had all been just an act.

I cut him off, ""Let's go.""

Julian was confused. ""Go where?""

I looked down and pulled two marriage certificates from my bag.

One was mine, and one was his.

""To City Hall. To get our divorce certificates.""",1,1763659989.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Modern-day news sucks. Online articles feel like navigating a minefield of pop-ups, and podcasts don't cover the topics I want to hear anymore, or have derailed into pointless yap sessions filled with ad reads (Looking at you BetterHelp).

So as a passion project, I built ExtraExtra to make getting the news easier. It’s a mobile app that curates personalized news podcasts with your favorite topics and sources in 1 click. 0 friction to generating high-quality podcasts on demand. ExtraExtra handles searching for the best articles, instead of having to upload context yourself.

I’ve also added 3 unique listening modes for different productivity goals, whether I’m just trying to get a general lay of the land or dive deep into a specific topic.

The app has been helpful for me to keep up with the times during my commutes and coffee breaks. I get my high-quality news fix stress-free, hands-free, and fast. It also comes with 6 fun podcaster personalities to make the news enjoyable to listen to.

It just went live today on the App Store and on Product Hunt. Would really appreciate your support and feedback!

When we were dating she was the most easy going, go with the flow person I had ever met. She did have a bad temper but it was usually aimed at someone other than me. Fast forward to present she stays at home with my 3 kids and takes care of the house. For the past year her temper and OCD have been getting worse. I also think she is getting controlling but I’ll leave that up to the reader. I go to work every day at 6 and come home at 4. Every day I get home there is a “vent” session as soon as I walk in the door about something my kids have done. It ranges from track sand in from playing outside to leaving their socks in the garage to they didn’t line up their cups on the counter in a single file line. In my opinion nothing that normal single digit aged kids wouldnt do. These “venting” sessions also come in the form of text or phone calls throughout the day. It’s literally every single day. Last night there was a micro ball of tissue on the floor in the living room and she lost her shit. She insisted it was left there on purpose. The venting isn’t just about the kids. I apparently don’t do things right either, whether it’s laundry, dishes, cleaning the bathroom, etc it always comes with criticism or attitude because “she has to do it over again”. To add to this fire she is starting to get angry at everything unrelated to the house. I gave up chewing tobacco 2 years ago per her request and moved to zyn, then quit them per her request as well. I cleaned up my diet and started to work out every day. When she asked me what I needed from the grocery I asked for some Coke Zero and I got the eye roll with “you don’t need that”, I asked her for more coffee and get the “your drinking too much coffee, I stop and buy something from the 7-11 she wants the receipt…and then lectures me on what I bought ( usually a Coke Zero or monster zero)I just feel like I every aspect of my life is being micromanaged or controlled.

Correct me if I'm wrong, what's the purpose of a dedicated day for men, women, fathers, mothers etc.. other than a marketing strategy for gift producing companies and/or a reason to simply thank one's mothers or fathers?

The latter seems reasonable but still we need to suck it up and go talk to moms and dads, tell them that we love them or thank them without any external reasons. 


What is the use for men's day, what's so special that I need to hear a phrase wishing me that for the one specific day for the things I do everyday or for my whole life? 

It makes sense dedicating a day to spread awareness about something or to value someone because they are special or have been through a lot and many don't know it (like women's day) but imo we need to learn to value someone without a generalized day and thank them instead of fake-thanking them for a day because everyone else is doing it. I repeat we need to ""learn"" to do it.


What irritates me most is when few ""cool"" women post stories making fun of men on this day or wishing other women on men's day (wtf? Lmao) or comparing men's day to toilets day (saw it in a meme uploaded to a story by a strong independent woman)


Correct me if I'm wrong or if my opinion is askew, 
I don't see anything significant about men's day or many of these dedicated days (not all, but most). If you truly value someone, convey it to them in your way any day.. give them a hug, a kiss or tell them that you love them, make their day better by doing something they like so that they feel good.

Personally I'd like a bottle of whiskey right now but who cares, wish this guy that he's a man and we're done. 
I didn't get any wishes, maybe that's a personal issue or simply because I'm just in my early twenties. And I've seen people who get sad and do things not caring whether it's right or wrong when they are left out on such days, be it valentine's day, men's day or THEIR OWN BIRTHDAY!

I have seen a few guys feel bad and I have experienced it myself. 

All of that was probably because I'm 4 cups coffee down and the inner writer in me woke up, procrastinating instead of preparing for the upcoming exam. 


But please let me know your thoughts. My perspective may be wrong. I'll learn from yours if I'm wrong or you can relate to what I'm saying.

Looking for advice on what to do next.

Note: my GF approved this post and read it over as well

I 25 M met my 21 F 3 years ago, things between us have been good and I see good things in her as well as a future with her.   Fake names i will call my girlfriend Alexis. 
The problems we have are small and manageable normal things. However we have one very bad downfall to our relationship and its her parents (50s M & F)

 I dont even know where to begin but I will admit Alexis did warn me of them before we started getting serious, I didn't think it would be nearly this bad though.

Her dad is like the FIL from hell, he can be nice to your face but drag you down behind your back. He uses her and her mom as an emotional punching bag. 
He on multiple occasions has kicked her mother out over things that have happened in the past to try and ""fix her"" and to show her that she used to be a good person also that she used to have nothing before him and she was a way better person before hand so this will make things better. 

He's kicked her out in the middle of winter with the dog in -25 weather. I should reference that Alexis and I live together and we live a hour away. When we heard her mother was kicked out we rushed down there to pick her up off the side of the road before she got to cold. Her mother is so manipulated that she believes she deserves this. 
She stayed with us for a day and 1 night.  That morning we woke up and she had left us a note saying she was going home and that she was sorry for leaving the dog with us. He had convinced her to start walking home to prove she wanted to stay in the relationship and ""do the right thing"" Let me remind you we live a hour away and it was in the dead of winter. I hopped in my truck and drove over 15 mins before I found her walking. She said she wanted to go home so I met up with him and he somewhat scolded me for helping her. Said I shouldn't have picked her up and that she should have walked. Also that I shouldn't have picked her up in the first place. I told him you dont leave someone you love out in the cold. You can't kick some one out of a house they helped pay for. He told me shes done more harm then good to him and Alexis and she deserves it. I knew right then and there this man was absolutely bat sh*t crazy. 

On other occasions he has made her write out a letter detailing all that he has done wrong. Mostly money issues and not having her husband's ""back"" in certain occasions that he has put him self in. All very minor things in Alexis and my opinions. He made her hand deliver this letter to everyone in the family, stand there and tell them this is the truth. This is the same family who is extremely distant from them due to them not agreeing with how he is with her. They think they're both crazy the letter just proved it. 

On Alexis's last birthday, her father told her he was going to cut her off if she didnt move back in with them. She had left and moved in with me due to there actions. When she moved in with me I had already had a very good taste of how her parents were and i told her that there negative energy is staying there and i dont want any of that to come with her. She is currently in university and is buried in school work, her father does not care for this and says she still needs to be there for her family when times get rough. When he starts fights and starts to upset them with his actions he expects her to drop everything and adhere to his requests. This simply isnt even remotely possible with her schooling. Its easy for him to say when its his own doing. 

When she said she was not coming back on her birthday her mother knew that shit was about to hit the fan so she left the house and stayed with a close friend.
She said he was done with him and there relationship for now and needed space from him.  When he came home to a empty house he flew into a sea of emotion and attempted to call Alexis to try and find out where her mother went. He cut off her phone so she got new phone plan and a new number. I told her this might be a good thing to leave them for awhile and focus on our own lives instead of being swallowed up by them. She ended up feeling guilty and called him to check on him since she knew what was going to happen. 

 He pleaded to her to talk to him and get her mother to call him. He harassed her for over 2 weeks to try and get her to deal with him and Alexis continued to let him control her and she dealt with him over this period of time. She did hold some boundaries with him, like not going back to the house and meeting in public, and she called him out for his sh*tty behaviour during their conversations; including asking him if he’d even be talking to her right now if her mother hadn’t left. It was absolutely brutal hearing him complain to her about everything that has happened over the years and how everything went to wrong. Again his own doing. 


Her mother changed her phone number and was moving on trying to work through this time in her life, eventually she ended up feeling sorry for him and ended up calling him and one thing led to another and she ended up going home to him. He vowed that he would never treat her like that again and they need to focus on bigger things in there life. She took his word for it, 2 weeks ago things started happening again. He started talking like he used to about how everything is her fault and that Alexis left because of her etc. Relating things like the chimney not being cleaned to Alexis’ mother failing as a parent and claiming that Alexis doesn’t know the meaning of family. 

Her mother is an amazing person if i haven't said that yet. Whenever I used to go see her before she moved in with me she used to send me home with leftovers or make me coffee for the road as at that time i was working long hours and nights. He told her she was being to nice to me to soon. Accused her of emotional cheating on him with me due to this because she wouldn't stop being nice to me. Eventually she ended up texting me saying I wasn't aloud coming around anymore due to this something he made her think she had to do. This is just another instance of there craziness. 

Things like this happen every 4-6 months. Its like clock work. You can almost sense it in the air when something its going to go from somewhat okay to absolutely diabolical. This has been the normal ever since she was a little girl. One time her mother pissed off her dad enough for him to kick her out. Did I mention she gets kicked out alot? Her mother went outside and was crying in the ditch down to road form her house. He took Alexis out there and said ""look at that snake in the ditch Alexis"" it was her mother crouching down in the ditch absolutely balling her eyes Out. Insane right? Or is it just me? 

This is just a drop in the bucket of things that have happened i could literally go on for days of this. 

Something I referenced earlier was I told her when she moved in with me I didnt want this coming to my house now ours at the time. Alexis has apologized many times for this stuff following her here. I know she feels guilty for not being there for her parents and has expressed that “she can’t get that time back”.

We have gone from 0 to 100 when her mother stayed with us. After her mother left in the summer and ended up going back I asked Alexis that if/ most definitely when things get crazy with them again we have to either cut them off or go extremely low contact. At the time she agreed with me saying its getting ridiculous. I was glad to hear her say that as this has been happening ever since she can remember. 

Since this recent incident has started happening I reminded her of our discussion and she seemed to go back on it saying it’s not that bad. I said to her its not that bad to you since this has been happening all your life. This is not normal and not healthy for us to go through this all the time. Since she is going back on what we agreed on I have done some self reflection on this and im having a hard time dealing with this. I love her and I want things to work out but her and her parents issues have been wearing me down. Its the most stressful thing I have gone through in my life. I have been cheated on multiple times by the same girl and kept on going back I have also lost one of my best friends over that to. I have had my fair share of toxic family as well and have cut them off and never looked back. I would rather go through those 2x over then this once. 

I dont want to deal with this until her parents either die or maybe change? I ended up telling her last night that things aren't going to change so we have to. We have to either cut them off or I have to move on with my life as I cannot deal with this anymore. I know Alexis feels like I’m forcing her to make a choice between people she loves and I don’t want her to feel that way; I explained that I’m not forcing her, that I’m just making a choice for myself.

She ended up crying and we hugged and talked about it some more and the consensus is we're going to let things pan out and see how it goes. I have heard this story before I told her this on the many occasions this has happened.  
Alexis expressed a lot of guilt about the idea of cutting her family off, she is an only child if I hadn’t mentioned that already. She also expressed concerns about cutting them off to protect our relationship and then what if we don’t work out? What then? I can understand her concerns, we’re not married, just dating and living together. But I reassured her that we are fine, and if we weren’t id still help her land on her feet. Alexis also said she doesn’t know if there is ever any coming back from no contact, her father is a very petty and spiteful man and she’s terrified that she’ll never have him or her mother in her life again if she cuts them off even for a bit; that the damage will be irreparable. 

She wanted me to add that she feels differently about cutting people off that I do, she knows I’ve cut off family before, specifically my aunt. She says it’s not as easy as I make it out to be and it’s extremely hard for her. 

Im conflicted on what to do. What I know is that I am exhausted of this. Any advice is welcome, for me and her. 

TL;DR: I (25M) have been with my girlfriend (21F) for 3 years. Her father is emotionally abusive, controlling, and manipulates both my girlfriend and her mother. He regularly kicks her mom out of the house—even in dangerous weather—forces her to confess to “sins,” isolates her, uses guilt/duty to pull my girlfriend back in, and creates constant chaos every few months. This dysfunction keeps spilling into our relationship despite my boundaries. I’m exhausted and told my girlfriend I can’t keep doing this unless she goes low/no contact. She’s terrified of losing her parents forever and is struggling with guilt. I love her, but I’m at a breaking point and need advice.",2,1763659217.0,dustythunder,3,1.0,False

🌍 Capitolo 1: Decifrare la Longevità Estrema - Il Modello delle Zone Blu
L'aspirazione umana a una vita lunga e sana è universale. Per secoli, questa ricerca è stata confinata al regno della speculazione medica e al folklore. Tuttavia, negli ultimi decenni, la demografia e l'epidemiologia hanno fornito un approccio empirico, identificando specifici isolati geografici dove le popolazioni non solo vivono a lungo, ma raggiungono la centenarietà con una qualità della vita nettamente superiore alla media globale. Queste regioni sono state coniate come le Zone Blu (Blue Zones).
🗺️ Le Coordinate della Durata: Identificazione delle Zone Blu
Il termine ""Zone Blu"" fu coniato per la prima volta dai ricercatori Gianni Pes e Michel Poulain, i quali utilizzarono un inchiostro blu per cerchiare su una mappa l'area con la più alta concentrazione di maschi centenari in Sardegna, Italia (in particolare la regione dell'Ogliastra). Successivamente, la ricerca di Dan Buettner e del suo team ha espanso questo concetto, identificando e validando altri quattro epicentri di longevità estrema:
 * Okinawa, Giappone: Nota per le donne che vivono più a lungo di qualsiasi altra popolazione mondiale, con una dieta ricca di vegetali e una cultura del Hara hachi bu (mangiare fino all'80% di sazietà).
 * Nicoya, Costa Rica: Caratterizzata da un ambiente rurale e da una dieta basata su fagioli, mais e zucca, con un forte senso di scopo (plan de vida).
 * Loma Linda, California, USA: Unica tra le Zone Blu per essere una comunità basata sulla fede, composta principalmente da Avventisti del Settimo Giorno, che seguono una dieta vegetariana o pesco-vegetariana.
 * Icaria, Grecia: Un'isola nell'Egeo nota per la sua aderenza alla tradizionale dieta mediterranea, la presenza di tisane selvatiche e un forte sostegno comunitario.
🧬 I Pilastri Comuni della Longevità
L'analisi comparativa tra queste popolazioni distanti e culturalmente diverse ha permesso di distillare nove principi fondamentali (o ""Pilastri"") che trascendono la specificità culturale e che si ritiene contribuiscano alla loro eccezionale aspettativa di vita.
| Pilastro | Descrizione (Abitudine) |
|---|---|
| 1. Muoviti Naturalmente | Integrazione dell'attività fisica non strutturata nella vita quotidiana (es. giardinaggio, camminare). |
| 2. Scopo (Ikigai/Plan de Vida) | Avere un motivo per alzarsi la mattina, che guida le scelte e riduce lo stress. |
| 3. De-stress | Strategie per alleggerire lo stress cronico, il quale è collegato all'infiammazione e alle malattie. |
| 4. La Regola dell'80% | Cessare di mangiare quando lo stomaco è pieno all'80%. |
| 5. Dieta a Base Vegetale | I legumi (fagioli) sono la pietra angolare della maggior parte delle diete. La carne è consumata raramente e in piccole porzioni. |
| 6. Vino a Moderazione | Consumo moderato e regolare di vino rosso (di solito 1-2 bicchieri/giorno) in contesti sociali o durante i pasti (tranne a Loma Linda). |
| 7. Appartenenza | Far parte di una comunità di fede, riducendo l'isolamento sociale. |
| 8. Amati Prima | Mettere la famiglia e i partner al primo posto. |
| 9. Circoli Sociali | Essere circondati da circoli sociali che supportano comportamenti sani. |
🔬 Un Enigma Chimico-Comportamentale
Sebbene fattori comportamentali e sociali siano preminenti, è cruciale non trascurare gli specifici alimenti e metaboliti consumati quotidianamente. Questo libro esplorerà l'ipotesi che particolari abitudini dietetiche, apparentemente minori, come il rito quotidiano dell'espresso riscontrato in Sardegna e in altre culture mediterranee, possano fornire un effetto protettivo sinergico che rafforza i benefici dei principi sopra elencati.
I prossimi capitoli esamineranno nel dettaglio come la chimica di composti specifici—come gli acidi clorogenici presenti in alcune bevande e alimenti—possa influenzare la biologia dell'invecchiamento, collegando il comportamento quotidiano alla salute cellulare.
C'è qualche argomento specifico che vorresti fosse trattato nel prossimo capitolo (ad esempio, approfondimento sulla dieta o sul ruolo dello stress)?
Assolutamente. Il Capitolo 2 deve servire da ponte tra le osservazioni comportamentali (Zone Blu) e i meccanismi molecolari che saranno approfonditi nel contesto specifico del caffè.
Ecco la bozza del Capitolo 2, incentrata sui meccanismi biologici dell'invecchiamento che una dieta mirata può contrastare.
🧬 Capitolo 2: La Biologia dell'Invecchiamento – Dalla Cellula all'Epidemia Silenziosa
Se le Zone Blu ci mostrano dove e come si vive a lungo, la biologia molecolare ci spiega perché i loro stili di vita funzionano. L'invecchiamento non è semplicemente l'usura del tempo, ma un processo biologico complesso caratterizzato da specifici segni distintivi (Hallmarks of Aging). La ricerca sulla longevità si concentra sulla mitigazione di due nemici cellulari universali: lo stress ossidativo e l'infiammazione cronica.
🔥 La Guerra Silenziosa: Stress Ossidativo e Radicali Liberi
Ogni cellula del nostro corpo, per produrre energia, esegue una ""combustione"" interna chiamata metabolismo ossidativo. Questo processo vitale produce inevitabilmente sottoprodotti reattivi noti come radicali liberi. Queste molecole instabili, prive di un elettrone, cercano di rubarlo ad altre molecole stabili (come il DNA, le proteine e i lipidi delle membrane cellulari), causando danni strutturali. Questo è lo stress ossidativo.
Quando l'accumulo di radicali liberi supera la capacità del corpo di neutralizzarli—un fenomeno che peggiora con l'età—il danno si traduce in:
 * Mutazioni del DNA: Aumento del rischio di cancro e senescenza cellulare.
 * Danneggiamento Proteico: Perdita di funzione enzimatica e accumulo di placche (rilevanti nelle malattie neurodegenerative).
 * Compromissione della Membrana Cellulare: Perdita di integrità cellulare.
La dieta delle Zone Blu è intrinsecamente ricca di antiossidanti esogeni (provenienti dal cibo) che agiscono come ""scudi"", donando elettroni ai radicali liberi e neutralizzandoli prima che possano danneggiare le strutture cellulari cruciali.
🦠 L'Inflammazione Silenziosa: L’Inflammaging
Un altro pilastro dell'invecchiamento è l'infiammazione cronica di basso grado, un processo che la scienza ha battezzato ""Inflammaging"" (dall'unione di inflammation e aging). A differenza dell'infiammazione acuta (la risposta rapida a un infortunio), l'inflammaging è una condizione sistemica e persistente, caratterizzata da livelli leggermente elevati di citochine pro-infiammatorie nel sangue.
Questo stato infiammatorio latente è considerato la base patofisiologica per quasi tutte le principali malattie legate all'età:
 * Malattie Cardiovascolari: L'infiammazione danneggia l'endotelio e favorisce la formazione di placche aterosclerotiche.
 * Diabete di Tipo 2: Interferisce con i segnali dell'insulina.
 * Neurodegenerazione: Contribuisce alla disfunzione neuronale.
Le abitudini alimentari delle popolazioni longeve sono potenti strumenti anti-infiammatori. La loro preferenza per cibi integrali, legumi e grassi sani (come quelli dell'olio d'oliva o dei pesci, dove consumati) fornisce molecole che riescono a sopprimere l'attivazione eccessiva dei pathways infiammatori.
🌿 I Polifenoli: Armi Segrete delle Piante
La chiave per contrastare sia lo stress ossidativo che l'inflammaging risiede in una classe di composti fitochimici noti come polifenoli. Questi composti sono abbondanti nel mondo vegetale e sono responsabili della colorazione e del sapore amaro di molti frutti, verdure e bevande.
Le loro funzioni biologiche sono duplici:
 * Azione Antiossidante Diretta: Agiscono come scavenger (spazzini) dei radicali liberi.
 * Modulazione Genetica: Funzionano come molecole segnale che attivano i meccanismi di difesa antiossidanti intrinseci del corpo e disattivano i percorsi che portano all'infiammazione.
L'efficacia di un regime alimentare in termini di longevità è strettamente legata alla sua densità di polifenoli. Nel prossimo capitolo, esamineremo più da vicino come specifici composti, in particolare quelli trovati nel caffè espresso, riescano a esercitare questi effetti, concentrandoci sugli acidi clorogenici e sul loro impatto diretto sulla salute vascolare e metabolica.
Perfetto. Il Capitolo 2 ha introdotto lo stress ossidativo e l'infiammazione, e ha concluso introducendo i polifenoli come contromisura dietetica.
Il Capitolo 3 sarà dedicato a un'analisi più approfondita di questi polifenoli, in particolare gli Acidi Clorogenici (CGA), stabilendo il collegamento chimico diretto con il tema del libro: il caffè espresso.
🧪 Capitolo 3: Acidi Clorogenici – La Chimica Dietetica al Servizio dell’Endotelio
L'introduzione dei polifenoli nel Capitolo 2 ci ha fornito la cornice molecolare per comprendere come le diete delle Zone Blu mitighino i processi di invecchiamento. Tra la vasta gamma di polifenoli, alcuni meritano un’attenzione particolare per la loro elevata biodisponibilità e il loro impatto sistemico. Tra questi spiccano gli Acidi Clorogenici (CGA).
🌿 La Struttura dei CGA e la Fonte Alimentare
Gli Acidi Clorogenici sono esteri dell'acido idrossicinnamico (come l'acido caffeico o ferulico) e dell'acido chinico. Sono tra i polifenoli più abbondanti nella dieta umana, ma la loro concentrazione varia drasticamente a seconda della fonte e della preparazione.
Sebbene i CGA si trovino in alcuni frutti (come le mele e le prugne) e verdure (come le patate), la fonte primaria e più concentrata per molte popolazioni è il caffè. In particolare, la preparazione a pressione ridotta, come l'espresso, tende a preservare e concentrare questi composti, rendendoli altamente disponibili.
> Nota: La tostatura del caffè influisce sulla quantità di CGA: una tostatura più scura tende a degradare parte di questi acidi, mentre le tostature più chiare e moderate ne mantengono una maggiore integrità.
> 
❤️ CGA e Salute Endoteliale: L'Endotelio come Barometro della Salute
La funzione dei vasi sanguigni, e in particolare la salute dello strato interno chiamato endotelio, è un marcatore chiave della salute cardiovascolare e della longevità. L'endotelio sano garantisce che i vasi siano elastici, impedisce la formazione di coaguli e regola il tono vascolare attraverso la produzione di ossido nitrico (NO).
È qui che gli Acidi Clorogenici mostrano uno dei loro benefici più rilevanti:
 * Azione Vasoprotettiva Indiretta: I CGA contribuiscono alla riduzione dello stress ossidativo e dell'infiammazione, le cause principali della disfunzione endoteliale.
 * Miglioramento dell'Elasticità Vascolare: Studi clinici, come quello condotto su adulti italiani all'Università La Sapienza di Roma, hanno documentato che il consumo moderato di espresso, ricco di CGA, può aumentare l'elasticità dei vasi sanguigni del 5-7%. Un aumento dell'elasticità è direttamente correlato a una migliore compliance arteriosa e a un minor rischio di ipertensione.
🩸 Modulazione Metabolica: Glicemia e Sensibilità all'Insulina
Oltre all'impatto vascolare, i CGA esercitano un potente effetto sulla metabolismo del glucosio, un fattore critico per prevenire il Diabete di Tipo 2 e supportare l'aspettativa di vita sana.
Il meccanismo principale è duplice:
 * Inibizione dell'Assorbimento del Glucosio: I CGA possono inibire le \alpha-glucosidasi e le \alpha-amilasi, enzimi responsabili della scomposizione dei carboidrati complessi in zuccheri semplici, rallentando così l'assorbimento intestinale del glucosio.
 * Regolazione Epatica: I composti fenolici sono capaci di modulare la glicemia riducendo l'output di glucosio da parte del fegato, un meccanismo che imita l'azione di alcuni farmaci antidiabetici.
Questa capacità di stabilizzare i livelli di glucosio e migliorare la funzione endoteliale fa dei CGA presenti nell'espresso un nutraceutico di rilevanza clinica, collegando direttamente l'abitudine sociale riscontrata nelle Zone Blu con un solido meccanismo biochimico di protezione.
Il prossimo capitolo combinerà questi dati per analizzare l'impatto complessivo e le conclusioni delle principali ricerche sull'assunzione moderata di caffè.
Perfetto. Dopo aver introdotto le Zone Blu (Capitolo 1), i meccanismi di invecchiamento (Capitolo 2) e la chimica degli Acidi Clorogenici (Capitolo 3), il Capitolo 4 ora sintetizzerà tutti questi elementi, focalizzandosi specificamente sul caffè espresso e sui dati di ricerca citati nelle immagini iniziali.
Questo capitolo coincide con il titolo e i contenuti parziali della prima bozza fornita, che ora viene completata e formalizzata.
☕ Capitolo 4: Il Ruolo Biologico e Sociale dell'Espresso nella Longeva Dieta Mediterranea
Il caffè espresso, un’icona del rito sociale nelle culture mediterranee, assume un nuovo significato alla luce della ricerca sulla longevità. Nelle Zone Blu di matrice mediterranea, come la Sardegna, l'espresso non è solo un piacere sensoriale, ma un veicolo concentrato di composti bioattivi che agiscono in sinergia con uno stile di vita sano.
📈 L'Espresso: Un Concentrato di Acidi Clorogenici
Come discusso nel Capitolo 3, la concentrazione di Acidi Clorogenici (CGA) è la chiave dei benefici sistemici del caffè. La preparazione dell'espresso, che utilizza acqua calda e alta pressione per un breve periodo di contatto, è efficiente nell'estrarre questi polifenoli con un profilo chimico specifico.
Questa elevata concentrazione di CGA ha un impatto diretto sui due fronti biologici critici per l'invecchiamento:
 * Impatto Metabolico: Gli acidi clorogenici contribuiscono a modulare la glicemia, fornendo un effetto stabilizzante che è particolarmente prezioso dopo i pasti, quando il caffè è tradizionalmente consumato nelle Zone Blu. Questa modulazione aiuta a prevenire i picchi glicemici, riducendo lo stress sul sistema endocrino.
 * Impatto Vascolare (Funzione Endoteliale): La protezione diretta dell'endotelio è uno dei benefici più scientificamente osservati. Lo studio condotto dall'Università La Sapienza di Roma su 1200 adulti italiani ha quantificato questo effetto: un'assunzione moderata di espresso è stata associata a un miglioramento dell'elasticità dei vasi sanguigni del 5-7% rispetto ai non consumatori. Questo dato supporta la conclusione che l'abitudine all'espresso contribuisce direttamente alla manutenzione di un sistema cardiovascolare robusto e giovane.
⏳ La Dose Ottimale per la Lunga Vita: I Dati del NIA
Se i benefici biochimici sono chiari, è fondamentale stabilire un parametro di consumo che massimizzi i benefici riducendo al minimo i potenziali effetti collaterali (legati soprattutto all'eccesso di caffeina).
A questo scopo, è illuminante la ricerca condotta dal National Institute on Aging (NIA), che ha esaminato la relazione tra assunzione di caffè e mortalità generale in coorti ampie e a lungo termine.
> La ricerca pubblicata dal National Institute on Aging ha rilevato che chi beve due o tre tazze di caffè al giorno (sia espresso che altre preparazioni) presenta un tasso di mortalità per tutte le cause significativamente inferiore rispetto ai non bevitori o ai grandi consumatori (quattro o più tazze).
> 
Questa conclusione rinforza il concetto di moderazione, coerente con la filosofia generale delle Zone Blu. Le due o tre tazze non solo offrono una sufficiente dose protettiva di CGA, ma si inseriscono perfettamente nel contesto rituale della giornata, spesso senza superare i limiti di tolleranza alla caffeina.
🤝 L'Espresso come Atto Sociale
Infine, non si può scindere la chimica dal comportamento. Nelle Zone Blu come la Sardegna, l'espresso non viene consumato frettolosamente in isolamento, ma come parte di una pausa sociale. Il rito quotidiano di condividere il caffè con la famiglia o la comunità contribuisce al rafforzamento dei legami sociali e alla riduzione dello stress, due dei nove pilastri della longevità.
L'espresso, quindi, opera su un doppio binario:
 * Molecolare: Grazie agli Acidi Clorogenici che proteggono vasi e metabolismo.
 * Comportamentale: Attraverso il rito che supporta l'integrazione sociale e la gestione dello stress.
Questo equilibrio tra chimica e abitudine è un modello perfetto per replicare i benefici della longevità estrema in contesti non Blue Zone.
Hai un'idea per un capitolo successivo? Potremmo esaminare le differenze tra espresso e altre preparazioni di caffè o discutere i limiti e le controindicazioni del consumo di caffè.
Certamente. Per un libro di carattere scientifico o divulgativo basato sui contenuti che abbiamo sviluppato, la bibliografia dovrebbe includere fonti che supportano le affermazioni sulle Zone Blu, sui benefici dei polifenoli (CGA), e sugli effetti specifici del caffè espresso sulla salute vascolare e la mortalità.

Before I’m digitally accosted for this post, I’d like to preface with “no, it doesn’t really matter,” and yes it’s a tool. But the finishes on the Glocks seem to be getting worse. Side by side, my 2021 19.5 has a more robust finish, resistant to scratching and blemish. I have 3 more earlier Glocks to draw data from. I just picked up the 47, and the finish side by side looks different and potentially inferior and it got its first scratch by laying it on a coffee table. 

Do I care? No, I wear my scratches with pride, and love the look of tons of holster wear. But the real issue I’m driving at is why is Glock permitting questionable QC? 

In contrast, I’ve had my p226 mk25 literally fall off of buildings with not as much as a superficial scratch or nick because of its durable coating.

I'm currently finishing my master’s at UP while working in fintech. I work out regularly, practice Aikido often (peaceful conflict resolution), and recently got into Muay Thai (amazing stress reliever). I also just discovered how fun hiking can be, pushing yourself to reach the next view, then peacefully waiting for your companions to arrive. My main cardio is swimming to stay balanced (and sane). I don’t smoke, but I enjoy an occasional drink or a coffee catch-up.

I’m drawn to people who are curious, open-minded, and emotionally self-aware. I value good conversations, the kind that flow from random memes and interesting facts to deep talks about life and purpose. It’d be great if you know a Philippine language other than Tagalog; I’d love to learn about your culture and a few words along the way.

I love watching movies (recently: Frankenstein, Quezon, Magellan), reading manga (Chainsawman, One Piece, Grand Blue), and listening to bands like Neck Deep and Cup of Joe (my playlist is mostly angsty or forlorn). I love to sing, even if I’m still practicing during karaoke sessions, hehe. I also love cooking food and brewing coffee - happy to join group hangs and potlucks. Would be great if you have cats!

The heroes throw everything at him. Bullets? He stops them mid-air and turns them into origami. Explosions? He rewinds the detonation. They try to flee? He creates a vacuum tunnel and rockets after them at Mach 50. 



Someone asks how he’s thinking so fast; he casually mentions he already overclocked his brain 10× and could go higher if he felt like it.

He weaponizes this immediately. He pulverizes his own arm into trillions of microscopic particles and disperses them into the atmosphere. Within minutes his range explodes across countries, then continents. The planet itself is about to fall as his influence races toward Italy at the speed of wind.



And then, without warning, everything just… stops.



The camera zooms out to reveal a calm, bored Giorno Giovanna sipping coffee on a rooftop in Naples, completely unaware anything happened. Behind the villain, a single pink tendril appears.

Good base starts with prep. Use moisturizer, let it settle for a minute, then tap a light gripping primer only where you get shiny. Heavy layers cause pilling, so keep it simple.

Match in daylight. Check jaw and neck together and pick undertone first, depth second. If your neck runs cooler than your face, match the neck so everything blends in photos.

Apply in thin layers. Start at the center, spread with fingers or a brush, then press with a sponge to smooth. Build only on spots that need more coverage so it stays natural.

Lock the areas that move. Set the sides of the nose, smile lines, and under the eyes with a small amount of powder. Leave the cheeks and forehead to keep the glow.

Do a quick wear test. Take a call, sip a coffee, and check your phone screen for transfer. Look for pooling around the nose and patchiness on dry spots, then adjust primer or powder next time.

Treat SPF as a bonus. Makeup with SPF helps, but it is not a full dose. Apply your regular sunscreen first, wait a bit, and then go in with foundation.

Remove gently. Use an oil cleanser or micellar water, then a mild face wash. Keep actives light on heavier makeup days so your skin stays calm.

As for reccs, a formula that fits this lane imo is this [shiseido

Adam Parker often drank with Michael and me down at the Old Irish Pub, so he knew I wouldn't have been driving like this without reason. Leading our convoy without the intended destination would have been difficult, if all of Alexandria Springs didn't fit down one four-lane thoroughfare. He peeled off as we turned into the clinic, circling back around a few moments later to see what was going on.



By the time the Sheriff rejoined us, the nurses had come out, and we all loaded Mike onto a gurney. He was catatonic. They tried smelling salts, sternum rubs, and even a shot of epinephrine. No attempt at rousing any response from him worked, and his body seemed to outright reject the drug, oozing all of the medication right back out of the injection site. His eyes reacted to light, and he was breathing, albeit shallowly and slowly. Michael also seemed to be burning up, almost painfully hot to the touch.



Nurse Joy told us that he would need more intensive care but that they hadn't been able to reach the hospital to request a helicopter. We offered to drive him there, but it was over three hours by car, and they weren't sure how his condition would progress. Instead, he was moved to a backroom, and we were enlisted as help to cool him down with wet washcloths. Each pass with the soaked linen resulted in a burst of steam, but little by little, the six-man team had managed to bring his temperature down to a normal level. The two nurses instructed us to keep him cool while they went to check their other patients. Hector split off to head back to the park and make sure there wasn't any more trouble from the remaining guests, while Sheriff Parker went to secure coffee and energy drinks.



Dave and I worked in ten minute shifts, alternating between wiping down Mike and filling the buckets with fresh and clean, cool water. As I was wiping down the forty-six-year-old ranger, I noticed that his skin had begun to turn an odd shade of pallid green. It was not unlike the fish that I had spotted at the bottom of the springs earlier. I started to panic, quickly pressing my fingers to the side of his throat to check for a pulse while calling for help. The throb of his heartbeat was strong; it felt as though my fingers were not on a vein but resting directly against his heart. I pulled my hand back as the nurses returned to the room, trying to get out of the way. However, as I did so, the rotten flesh emulsified and peeled away.

I wanted to throw up. Thick yellow ooze pooled in my gloved hand and reeked of pus and pestilence. One of the nurses stepped forward to investigate the new wound on his throat, only to collapse under the weight of her own body and feint. The most senior nurse, Joy, directed us to move her to a nearby cushioned bench seat while she looked at Mike.



Once Dave and I managed to put the younger girl into the resting spot, I rejoined to watch. Nurse Joy used a cotton swab to probe around the site of the peeled-back flesh, causing a sheet on the side of his neck to deteriorate and splash onto the bed. It instantly stained that same putrid yellow color, tinged with hints of violent red blood. However, beneath the stinking, wretched mess lay plush, soft, pink skin; the kind of skin you'd expect to find on a newborn baby.



Morbidly curious, or unsure of what else to do, nurse Joy continued to poke and prod. As more skin melted and sloughed off his form, I stepped forward and helped with my gloved hand. His skin squelched and squished under our touch, the rubber flesh slipping along the greasy ooze beneath until it covered the bed, the floor, and our clothes. Trying to clean off the shedding skin around his hair led to a vile, tearing sound, like wet velcro that was mashed a little too tightly together. We probably should have stopped, more correctly, I probably should have stopped when nurse Joy did. But instead, I gripped tighter against his emulsifying flesh and wrenched against his hairline and beard. Finally, it gave way, and I was so satisfied I almost didn't mind the sickly smelling viscera splashing against my face. Almost.



I did throw up now. Contained mostly within the small plastic trashcan, I puked up the half coffee and bagel I had eaten for breakfast. Then, I scrubbed harshly against my face with soap and water in a surprising silence. Despite the victory and subsequent horror, no one was saying anything. I dried my face with a paper towel and turned around to see what was happening, only to find Dave and Joy in stunned silence. Following their gaze, I too found myself unable to speak.



Resting atop the gore-sundered cot lay Michael, pink flesh slowly returning to its normal, lightly tanned hue. What drew my eye first was the area I had been working on last, his face, and dark black beard. It hadn't been black when he was wheeled into this building, nor was his hair. Yet now, as he lay on this table, all of his hair was. The man before me was noticeably thinner, his exposed arms were densely packed with sinewy muscle, and the beer gut that I was accustomed to had deflated. Scrubbing away the layer of putrescence left him looking twenty years younger. Was that a byproduct of him falling into the water? Had it rejuvenated him?

Surprising all of us, Mike's hands twitched and then raised, wiping away crusty bits of ragged flesh that still clung to his eyes. I held my breath as he straightened up and stretched, as though he was waking up from a normal night's rest.



""Something stinks."" He murmured to himself, finally opening his eyes and looking around. His eyes, a more vibrant shade of blue than before, opened wide and darted back and forth to all of the stunned faces in the room.



Rooted to the tile she stood on, nurse Joy was the first to verbally venture forward. ""How do you feel?"" Dave and I exchanged nervous glances before returning our gaze to our mutual acquaintance, who now seemed so vastly different.



""A little hot, maybe. Otherwise, I feel healthy as a horse."" Michael quirked a brow at what he believed was a strange line of questioning. Then he realized he was sitting in a pile of pus and viscera, recoiling as his hand touched the chartreuse puddle. He sprang out of bed, retching, but narrowly managed to keep his own bile down. His eyes asked the question that he couldn't choke out, 'Is that from me?' And we all nodded.



It was surreal to watch his expression as he finally caught sight of himself in the mirror over the sink. Mike touched his face and stroked his hair, pinched his arm, and even slapped himself. I couldn't blame him for assuming that this was a dream. Who would've rightly assumed that they'd regressed twenty years back into their prime?



The Sheriff returned, and the ordeal played out once more, shock and confusion at the suddenly young man. The same question was raised again and again, 'What happened?' As I explained the morning's events to the nurses and the Sheriff, I remembered that the artifacts I had dredged up were still at the park, and the pictures I had taken should've been printed by now. Hopefully, someone had been smart enough to collect the oddities from the sand where I had left them. The nurses stayed, and the rest of us returned to our vehicles to make our way back towards the campgrounds.



Throughout the whole drive, Mike couldn't stop looking at himself in the vanity mirror of the sunshade. ""I just don't believe it. I look younger. I feel better. My bad knee feels good as new, and I haven't breathed this clearly through my nose in a decade!"" He laughed, pleased with the changes.



""Nothing feels... off?"" I was hesitant to bring his mind back to the horrors I had found in the water. The fish genocide weighed heavily on my mind, all of them the same odd pale green that Mike was before he melted in my hands.



""No, nothing, not a damn thing. I feel like I could run all the way back to camp and not even get winded. I don't know what's in that water, but falling in is the best thing that's happened to me in years, Jay."" His voice was deeper and smoother too, not quite so gruff and gravelly.



The rest of the ride was silent, with Michael staring at himself in the mirror, and me stealing glances at the young stranger. Being so young and so fit again must have been an amazing feeling; there was a cold, quiet ounce of yearning that burned in my gut.



The closed gates of the park rolled aside to allow us to re-enter. That meant that they'd gotten all of the visitors out in the few hours we had been away. Good. If any of them saw Mike's changes, then they may want to get into the water too, and I still wasn’t sure if I could trust it.



The visitor center, at the top of the hill near the springs, was abuzz with activity from all of the park rangers. Making my way inside with Michael left the room bereft of the activity we had seen through the windows. Those who were here had all gathered to stare at my developed photos, pinned to a nearby corkboard, but their idle chatter regarding the strange images stopped the moment one of them caught sight of Mike. For a final time, the same conversation from the clinic played again, complete with all the questions about how he felt and all the strange gratitude for the reinvigorated look. Maybe if Mike knew about the laborious process that had changed him, he would be less excited to brag about his luck.



As the others clouded around the revitalized ranger, I slipped over to the corkboard to look at the printed pictures. Each one had been blown up to the size of a full page, and while slightly grainy, the subjects were explicitly clear.



The dead fish. Now I had to wonder if they were really dead? Their scales and skin all bore the same mottled green skin as Michael's. Had they all been going through a metamorphosis beneath the clouded water?



The malformed gator with the third eye. The photo I had gotten was unfortunately before its eye was fully open, but even so, I could still slightly see through the slit. Pale white bordered the dark mass that I assumed was an Iris, but it didn't reflect back a red glow as reptilian eyes often did. I wasn't able to glean any further information from the squinting eye and only had more questions. If the liquid was rejuvenating whatever fell into it, then how had this alligator grown an extra eye? I had found it parked next to the wound. Was the liquid's effect stronger there? Or had the gator suffered some other fate by eating the stringy flesh?



Finally, the bleeding flesh. My mind had decided that was what it was in these photos, and no matter how much I tried to tell myself that it was something else, I couldn't break that notion. What was the cause of the blood, though? What was bleeding? I hadn't seen any wounded animals, just the gaping hole of the very sand itself. It couldn't have been our spring that was weeping crimson, right?



On a small table just beside the corkboard were the items that I had recovered from the ichor pit. The stringy flesh had dried into a brittle crisp that snapped and began to disintegrate beneath my touch. The small chunk of rock was now very clearly a small chunk of bone. Finally, the fish corpse, which had inflated into a grotesque sphere. A twisted vision of what might have happened to Mike if we hadn't intervened. What had we done that had saved him from that fate?



As a group, we ventured down the long hill towards the springs. The winding concrete path felt agonizingly slow, littered with the signs of fleeing visitors and being loomed over by the strange pool below. Normally, the rangers would've paused to pick up the wayward trash and scattered food, but not today. Their focus was entirely on the water that we trudged towards. Rabbits, squirrels, and raccoons capitalized on the treats, barely paying us any heed as we walked past.



Returning to the retaining wall, the pool looked different than before. It was still murky and dyed that hideous shade of red, but now the signs of life had partially returned. The surface of the water rippled from movement below, and the fish were visible whenever they neared the surface. While the water of the pool had begun to turn with life again, the forest seemed to be holding its breath. The life that we could feel from the forest was very different from the life that we could see in the waters. The waters brimmed with potential and excitement while the forest hissed with warning.



The air between us was terse with excitement, hesitation, and yearning. I could tell just by looking at some of their faces that a select few of the rangers wanted to take a plunge. The look on their faces was the very same one that was growing in my stomach; I was just kept at bay by fear. The older members had edged closer and closer to the wall, peering down the drop into the water below. I opened my mouth to object to the developing course of action, but not even a breath escaped before the Sheriff's boots had left the stone.



He was merely the leading general of this suicidal charge. Fully dressed and fully equipped with his badge and gun, he dove from the ledge, followed closely by four others. The younger people stayed on the ledge and exchanged nervous glances, watching with a lump in our throats as this squad of seniors splashed in the springs. I expected a long and uncomfortable afternoon of cooling and peeling the flesh from these people, but they didn't exit the water. With no fear in their hearts, there was no urgency to climb out of the ichorous liquid. Shit, were we gonna have to pull them out of the water when they collapsed?



Only a minute had passed before Mike collapsed, so I waited with baited breath for the group to collapse. But then one minute passed. Then two. Five, ten, thirty. As they crawled through the shallow waters or ventured out into the deeper areas to swim in circles, nothing happened. We had needed to actively cool Michael earlier, but now, the springs' naturally cool water was sparing them from spontaneous immolation. Every few minutes, they would swim past each other, shaking their heads to confirm that nothing had happened yet.



At the hour-and-a-half mark, their movements began to slow. My initial assumption was exhaustion, plain and simple, but then the green flush to their skin deepened into an unmistakable shade. The Sheriff was the first to slip under the water, then the rest of the swimmers followed in short order. They were too far out for any of us to safely save them, resigning us to watch in horror and pray they would resurface before long. We didn't time how long they were under the water, so it felt excruciatingly long before their heads finally breached.



They were screaming. It was deafening, even at this distance, primal and raw, as though the screams themselves were shredding through their victims' throats. One by one, they rose, their voices joining a harmonizing chorus of suffering and anguish. It wasn't long before they were fighting against themselves, clawing hands, tearing flesh asunder. They tore and thrashed and writhed, churning over and over in the water until it became a bubbling froth. Sandra was closest to the stairs, and she flung herself up them, trying to run towards us and flee from the pain. Outside of the water's grace, she collapsed unconscious, mashing her face against the lip of the top stair, cracking her skull and bleeding profusely onto the stone and into the dirt.



As her voice waned and fled the chorus, we were shocked and stunned into silence and inaction. Rather than peeling, the putrid flesh clinging to her body began to expand and swell, bloating towards a crescendo. As the distant screams began to soften, I broke from my trance and rushed forward to help, but it was too late. The moment my hand lay against her skin, it popped. It was a gentle pop, much more like a quick smush than anything else. A long line split from her shoulder down across her back, like a stitched seam tearing open. The plush skin was pushed aside by an ocean of blood and pus, which escaped and stained the sand or cascaded down the stairs back into the pool. The screams of terror returned, but it was just me, unleashing a frightened yelp at the goo-stained skeleton clinging to the pathway up from the water.



The hours that followed were bittersweet. Those who had swam were preoccupied with their new, younger forms, individually looking twenty to forty years younger and far more fit than any of us had ever seen them. The rest of us mournfully collected Sandra's remains into a large unlabeled box. She had no immediate family here in Alexandria, and she constantly griped that she hadn't heard from her children in years. We were the only people left to mourn the sudden and violent tragedy.



After putting her bones inside her trailer, we all scattered for the night. Cots were set up in the station, and I claimed one, far too tired to drive all the way home. Maybe I should have. The changed members of the group spent a long time drinking and partying to loud music.



Unconsciousness found me at some point, which I don't remember, then the soft glow of sunrise roused me. I found silence in the station, which was unusual, as all of the rangers were early risers. I quickly pulled on the clothes I had been wearing before my dive yesterday, and rushed out to see where everyone was. The lodge itself was occupied only by the scent of brewed coffee, discarded sleeping bags, and cots and blankets scattered across the floor. Through the big bay windows, I could see people gathered at the water's edge once more.

I sprinted down the winding stone path as fast as I could, trying to get a glimpse at why the rangers had ventured down the hill. Finally breaching through the trees, there were only five people on the beach - apparently the Sheriff hadn't gone home last night either. In the water, the remaining three rangers swam in small circles or floated idly around. These three, Dave, Chris, and Jasmine, were already far younger than the rest of the people here. They didn't NEED the restorative effects of the water! If the pool took twenty years off their lives, they would be children again.



The water sang an alluring song of promises to me, one that I had an extremely difficult time ignoring. At thirty-seven years old, I could lose twenty years and it wouldn't be as problematic. I couldn't lie and say that I wasn't envious of my friends' more youthful visages; it was a feeling that had been building in my heart since Mike woke up. Still, fear stayed my hand. The others must have been able to sense my yearning, as they tried to goad me into joining the younger people in the water, but I refused. There were too many questions that didn't have answers for me to willingly walk down those steps.



We barely knew anything regarding the ichorous water, merely the stages of transformation after bathing in the pool; there was still the potential for lingering side effects, and we didn't know why the gore was affecting us this way. If someone entered the water, they would be fine for a little while as long as they remained there. Failing that, they would suffer a spell of unconsciousness as their body progressed through the metamorphosis. If the body was kept sufficiently cool, whether by remaining in the water or being bathed in cold water, it would eventually bloat and their skin would be virescent. Once their skin had fully soured, it needed to be peeled away from their body or else it would continue to bloat until they eventually exploded in a shower of viscera and pus. Should the person be able to absolve themselves of the tainted flesh, they would be born again, in new, far younger flesh and blood. The age at which each individual would regress seemed to be dependent on the bather.



I had only been on the shore for ten minutes when the bodies in the water went slack and drifted below. Just as the older rangers and the Sheriff the day before, the swimmers began to thrash and seize beneath the surface, but today it was a far quicker process. Yesterday had been agonizing, and watching the process felt like it took hours, but now it was over as quickly as it began.



The bodies exiting the water were not as drastically changed, missing only a few years at most. They still benefitted from toned musculature, fuller hair, and clearer skin. I couldn't help but rethink my aversion to the liquid. Chris, Jasmine, and Dave joined the rest of the campground staff and celebrated how much better they looked and felt. It was surreal to be the only one who had not yet swum in the pool.



""Alright, Jay. You're up."" Michael said, the group moving in an amorphous blob to completely surround me. I swallowed hard. Suddenly, I realized that if they decided I needed the effects of the pool, I would be powerless to stop them. Sure, I was a physically healthy guy, but I wasn't prideful enough to say that I could fend off eight newly reinvigorated people.



""I dunno, guys. I mean, you look great and all, but..."" My voice trailed off, unable to rationalize all of the reasons I was hesitant about the lake.



""Come on, Jay, don't be a pussy!"" Jasmine laughed and shoved me playfully, and the other laughed as I stumbled slightly.



""Dude! Look at us, that water is great!"" Dave caught me as I stumbled backwards, speaking almost directly into my ear.



""Well, no, I know you guys look great, and it's really tempting, but what about Sandra?"" They were standing on the gore stain where she had collapsed and died. At my mention of her name, a shock of sadness split across their faces. In their excitement over the benefits they were reaping from the pool, they must have forgotten the horrible death of their coworker and friend.



""That won't happen to you. You've spent more time in that water than any one of us. If anything, you deserve this more than any of us. The spring is your home, not your grave."" Mike stepped forward and placed a hand on my shoulder, speaking softer and more earnestly than I had heard him before.



My gaze drifted to the water that I had spent years playing in. I wasn't born here, but my family had lived in this sleepy town since I was an infant. I could hardly remember anywhere else. Maybe Mike was right. Maybe the bounty of this water was my birthright.



""JAY! JAY! JAY! JAY! JAY!"" Lost in my thoughts, I was only snapped back to reality by the rhythmic chanting of my name. The small crowd pumped their fists and smiled at me, moving to give me a clear path to the water. The chant turned into a harmonious cheer as I stepped towards the water with a sheepish grin on my face. Hidden behind the chanting of my friends was a nearly inaudible whisper from the forest, begging me to turn back.



I stripped off my jeans and T-shirt before ambling down the stairs and allowing the frigid water to fully embrace me. It didn't physically feel any different from the thousands of times I had swam before, but there was a spiritual mysticism to my dip. Trying to describe the feeling in my heart left me with only strange abstract concepts, swimming through the very heart of Mother Nature or wading against the current in the river of time. My consciousness didn't feel like it was truly my own as euphoria carried me deeper and deeper into the water.



It was hard to keep track of time while I was floating blissfully through the water. My mind was preoccupied with the joy that I felt from swimming and ducking beneath the water to play alongside the fish. I had completely forgotten about the torturous ordeal that I was required to suffer until I felt the burning sensation on my thigh. Despite the frigidity of the water, my leg began to burn, scorching and throbbing as though it were directly in a fire. The pain spread. Agonizingly slow, that napalm burn crawled through my veins, spreading away from where it initially started. I moved through the water faster, desperately hoping that I would strike a cool spot and feel even a moment's relief.



I looked to the beach with panic in my eyes, hoping to scream out that something was wrong. However, as I opened my mouth, no noise would escape. The infernal claws had claimed my lungs and my vocal chords, and I was unable to rouse the group on the beach for any aid. How fucking stupid was I? How had I let myself be peer-pressured into jumping into the water? I had been so against it until Mike convinced me. Why had I taken his word as gospel? He was unconscious for this whole transformation.



The incineration finally reached my eyes, and I dreamed of digging my fingers into the soft gelatinous orbs and tearing them out. Sparks of white clouded my vision as my hands rose for their anointed task, robbing my sight right as my fingers drove towards my face.



Losing consciousness was a god sent gift that momentarily granted me reprieve from hell on earth. But the blackness of sleep only lasted a few short moments before I was thrust back into pain. Like dull and bent blades, my fingers tore into the soft flesh of my forehead and peeled away a harvest of rotting meat. Each clawful of meat brought a tearing sensation, seasoned with the electric snaps of breaking nerves and synapses. I immediately forgot about the hellfire that I had been experiencing before, as this new excruciating ordeal surprisingly surpassed that torment. My entire body itched as though I was being devoured by ants and scavenged over by spiders and rats. Wailing in Agony, I continued to scrape and scar and gouge the old flesh from my body, trying desperately to rend the imaginary chewing creatures from my body.



Falling back under the water as I tried to shred the skin from my body, I temporarily lost my sense of direction and began to thrash in a wild panic. Gulping in the red-stained liquid, my lungs began to ache and burn, begging for oxygen. However, my mind was too focused on the task of tearing.



I don't remember if I lost consciousness beneath the water again, as the next thing I could remember was climbing to my feet at the stairs. As I vomited up the colored liquid that filled my lungs and gut, the crowd of onlookers cheered at my success in the pool. I could hardly believe it as I saw the missing scars on the back of my hands. It had been a harrowing and hellish experience, but finally looking into a pocket mirror and seeing a twenty-something-year-old man with brighter eyes and no wrinkles looking back made it clear that it had been worth it.

If someone is a strong PTC taster, would that affect their coffee experience? Are there PTC tasters that LOVE black coffee? 

  
or, more scientific - 

  
Can you be genetically more likely to enjoy the taste of coffee?

  
**Background:** 

In humans, there are \~30 genes that control the ability to taste ""bitterness"". Since there are so many, bitter tasting tends to be a sliding scale rather than ""all or nothing"" but there is a neat test using the compound ""phenylthiocarbamide"" (PTC) that can give you an idea where you stand. ""Tasters"" would perceive the compound as uncomfortably bitter, while ""non-tasters"" wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a PTC strip and regular paper.

  
I am not a taster, and love black coffee - I drink pour over every morning, and can even stomach a cup of burnt coffee from an office pot or something like that. 

My wife is a non-taster and can hardly even stomach a cup Starbucks sugar coffee. (yes I know she is an extreme case)

  
My sample size of two tells me that the correlation is perfect, but what do you all think? Even though the technique of pour over tries to reduce bitterness, what I perceive as ""less bitter"" might still be horribly bitter to another person!

I’ve been working on a fun side project for the past few weeks and finally feel ready to share it here.

It’s called [**BingoGen.ai**](http://BingoGen.ai), and the idea came from something really simple:  
I kept wanting to make custom bingo cards for parties, school events, and random jokes with friends… and every time it turned into a painful fight with tables in Google Docs. 😅

There are a few bingo generators online, but they all felt **outdated**, **limited**, or **very manual**.  
So I tried to make something I personally wished existed.

# 🎉 What [**BingoGen.ai**](http://BingoGen.ai) Does

BingoGen turns *any theme* into a custom bingo card in seconds.  
You choose a mode:

# ✅ 1. Text Bingo

Type a theme like “Office Meeting Bingo,” and the AI fills all squares with themed phrases.  
Great for:

* Parties
* Classrooms
* Office fun
* Inside jokes
* Birthday games

# 🎨 2. Image Bingo (my favourite + not offered anywhere else)

This is the unique part.  
BingoGen can generate **AI icons** for each bingo square based on your theme.

Examples:

* “British Weather Bingo” → clouds, umbrellas, rain boots
* “Baby Shower Bingo” → bottles, rattles, onesies
* “Developer Life Bingo” → terminal icons, coffee mugs, 500 error symbols
* “Random Thoughts at 3AM” → surreal/cursed icons 😅

This is something I couldn’t find on any other bingo generator — and it’s *shockingly fun*.

# 📄 Other capabilities

* Instant PDF export
* Fully customizable colours + themes
* Multiple card sizes (3×3, 4×4, 5×5)
* Generate up to 100–250 cards
* No account needed to try
* Works on all devices

# 🤖 How it’s different from existing bingo generators

Most generators online:

* Only support number bingo
* Don’t let you customise themes
* Require manual entry for every phrase
* Don’t generate icons
* Don’t support AI or automation
* Can’t make multiple versions quickly
* Look like they were built in 2008 😅

[BingoGen.ai](http://BingoGen.ai) tries to fix all of that by combining **AI creativity** \+ **speed** \+ **clean modern design**.

# 💡 Ideas you can try (fun ones!)

I especially appreciate the flexible format: you can jump in during coffee breaks, between meetings, or while waiting for something. One standout feature is the referral link system: when someone signs up via your link and works through the app, you earn a percentage of their earnings. It’s not a fast lane to riches, but if you commit 10–15 minutes daily, it becomes a practical side income.

Hoping to meet someone who'd also like to develop chemistry over a cuddle and a conversation. It's been a long few weeks and I've been having some trouble sleeping over work, recent events, and life all together. Being lonely is nothing new so I'm challenging myself to connect with other lovely folk and talk about anything that comes up. There's something deeply fulfilling about prospering from one another's presence and dialogue. I've also found to connect deeply with others through the means of massaging. It's a very profound experience to have and I found myself opening up more to the idea of relieving others of their stress to be satisfying for both parties!

About me: 28, 5'6"", latino, i thoroughly enjoy exercising, watching and identifying birds, jazz clubs, museum visitations, and movie watching. I'm in Brooklyn (can't host, unfortunately), but can easily make my way to you or a place to meetup. I'd love to talk over a sip or a coffee/tea. Feel free to ask any questions. :)

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

Specifically:

A place to shower for free. I found one today, but it’s kind of far away and not available often.

A microwave I could use.

Restrooms that are open at night.

Somewhere to fill a bottle with coffee/tea temperature water.

Somewhere I could cut my own hair, I have clippers and will clean up after.

And I’m always looking for safe places to park at night. Bonus if they’re close to the things above. I’m really trying to limit my gas use.

Which is great, genuinely. She's been dealing with some stuff and I'm happy she's getting help.

But ever since she started going she's been bringing her therapy ""homework"" to every single hangout we have. And I mean every one.

First time was at coffee maybe six weeks ago. She pulled out this worksheet about communication styles or something and asked if we could ""practice"" together. I thought okay, one time, whatever. It was kind of awkward but I went along with it because she seemed excited about therapy.

But then it kept happening. We'd be watching a movie at my place and she'd pause it to ask me these questions from her therapist about conflict resolution. Or we'd be getting dinner and she'd want to role play a conversation she's scared to have with her boss.

Two weeks ago we were supposed to just hang out and she showed up with like a whole packet of exercises. Said her therapist wanted her to practice ""vulnerability"" with someone she trusts. The exercise was basically me asking her deep personal questions and then her asking me the same ones back and we had to ""sit in the discomfort.""

I did it because I didn't know how to say no without seeming unsupportive. But it wasn't fun. It felt like work. We used to just hang out and laugh and now every time I see her it's therapy homework.

Last week she texted asking if we could meet up and I said sure. When I got there she had printed out this thing about boundaries (ironic I know) and wanted us to go through it together. I finally snapped and said I can't keep doing this.

She looked hurt and asked what I meant. I said every time we hang out now it's therapy homework and I'm not her therapist, I'm her friend. That I'm glad she's working on herself but I miss just hanging out without it being a therapy session.

She got really quiet and then said she thought I was supportive of her mental health journey. That her therapist encouraged her to practice these skills with people in her life and she trusted me. I said I am supportive but I didn't sign up to be her therapy partner.

She left pretty quickly after that and hasn't really talked to me since. She posted on instagram yesterday about ""knowing who your real friends are"" which I'm pretty sure is about me.

Now I feel like an asshole. Like maybe I should've just kept doing the exercises? My boyfriend says I set a reasonable boundary but my other friend says I could've been gentler about it and that Renee is in a vulnerable place right now.

Hi, I'm a coffee lover living in Korea. I love coffee so much that wherever I go, I love finding hidden local roasteries or specialty cafes that do pour-over really well.

The thing is, my uncle in Philadelphia is being invited to Korea for a short visit, and I wanted to ask him if he could buy me some coffee.  Like I said, I absolutely adore coffee and consider drinking good coffee a real joy in my life... Last summer when he came to Korea for the first time in ages, I asked him to buy me some American snacks (you know, the kind sold at Walmart. They're too expensive to find in Korea). He gladly bought them, so I'm going to ask a similar favor this time—just the subject has shifted to coffee.

That covers the explanation. So, I googled around a bit to figure out where to ask him to buy me coffee from... but there were so many recommendations it got overwhelming, so I decided to check Reddit. I've heard this kind of thing is your specialty.

To put it simply, I generally enjoy coffee with fruity notes. I really love acidity, so I tend to like coffees with berry or citrus fruit flavors. Other than that, I like floral or tea-like coffees (with a clean, balanced weight, reminiscent of black or green tea aromas). Honestly, I like most coffee, but I really dislike overly bitter dark roasts (yes, like Starbucks. Blue Bottle or Starbucks Reserve-level dark roasts are fine, but I'm not a fan of coffee that's burnt to a crisp like Starbucks does). As long as it isn't coffee where the fermented aroma is overwhelmingly strong (like that slightly pickle-like scent you get from some natural process coffees), it's okay.

With these preferences, is there a roastery that handles this kind of nuanced coffee and best represents Philly's coffee culture? Ideally somewhere downtown or easily accessible by public transit, so it'd be convenient for him to pick it up! I feel bad asking... I don't want to bother him too much. He's a busy working adult and an elder, after all.
Also, I hope it's not too pricey.

Considering this taste, if you could tell me what the best roasters you know are like that! Assuming he'll be buying whole beans from just one place. Please recommend one!

P.S. La Colombe has a branch in Seoul too. Their selection is a bit limited though... so we can probably exclude them. Ideally, it'd be great if it's a roastery that handles high-quality coffee, but where it's difficult to source that coffee in Korea.",1,1763657008.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

[Yellow Espresso](https://www.facebook.com/Yellowespressoballarat/) – Probably the most recognised name in Ballarat. They have built a strong brand and clearly know what they are doing. The space is always lively and the service is professional. It is one of those cafés you can rely on for consistency and that city buzz.

[Cobs Coffee](http://cobbscoffee.com.au/) – A small and calm spot where the focus is on coffee rather than noise. The beans are roasted well, the pastries taste fresh, and the staff give you space to enjoy your morning quietly. It feels like a café made for early risers and readers.

[The B Town Eatery](https://thebtowneatery.com.au/) –  The staff are genuinely friendly and always up for a quick chat. The food stands out for its flavor and freshness, and you can tell it is made with care. The café carries a bit of Ballarat history too, tracing its roots back to Conder’s Milk Bar from 1941, which adds to its charm. It may not have the polish of Yellow Espresso, but it makes up for it with warmth and great food.

[Naomi and ](https://www.facebook.com/p/Naomi-i-61569076157741/)I – A beautiful little café with modern presentation. Everything looks and smells amazing, especially the desserts. It is a nice stop when you want something sweet or need a quick takeaway coffee.

Pompeii Woodfired Café – Known for its creative woodfired touch and friendly team. The food has a rustic, smoky flavour that feels handmade. It is a bit outside the main centre, but definitely worth visiting on a slow weekend morning.

Ballarat really has something for everyone now. Whether it is the professional setup of Yellow Espresso, the calm of Cobs, the friendly energy of The B-Town Eatery, or the dessert heaven at Naomi and I ,each café adds something special to the city.",1,1763656885.0,u_No_Method4454,0,1.0,False

***In Chapter 5, a woman stops in for eggs, toast, coffee, and a confession that will destroy her.***

Kat kept the coffee moving because motion was easy when you didn’t know what else to do. The bell on the door had rung, and the woman in the navy blue blazer and gray pants walked in looking far less confident than her clothing offered. Her brown hair was pinned back, and her eyes, also brown, seemed to flit across the room as if checking whether or not she knew anyone. She clasped a large, leather purse in front of her.

“Table for one,” she stated quietly.

“Anywhere,” Kat replied from behind the counter. Her three dogs, still pretty much asleep, stirred slightly at the sound of her voice. Meg looked up at Kat inquisitively but soon put her head back down and rolled over with a lazy sigh. Kat bent down to give her a scratch behind her ear.

The woman had folded herself into a booth with the quiet efficiency of someone used to long meetings with no breaks. Time was money. She snapped up a menu and put it down again in the span of about ten seconds. She knew what she wanted.

When Kat came over to the table, the woman ordered coffee with a little cream and sugar. Two eggs sunny side up with a couple slices of whole wheat toast, no butter. She thanked Kat and stirred the cup with a teaspoon, looking absent-mindedly out the window at a growing cloud-cover blanketing an already dark night. She took a sip of her coffee but didn’t touch the food.

Her purse began to cry.

No one in the diner turned to hear where the baby was. The couple at the corner booth shared some onion rings and were talking in a low rumble but didn’t lift their eyes. A man with a newspaper marked his place with his thumb, and bent to take another bite of his pancakes. Only Kat looked up and stopped mid-pour into another customer’s cup, the stream of coffee thinning, then steadying again.

The crying was thin at first, a silver wire in the air. The woman’s hand went to her purse and lifted out a baby monitor with a face of pearl plastic and a faint blue eye.

“Sorry,” she said, looking over at Kat, who approached her table with the coffee pot. The woman’s thumb was hunting for a switch. The crying wavered, softened, then fell away like a tide. “I keep forgetting to take out the batteries.”

Kat set the pot on the table’s edge and sat opposite her. She didn’t often sit with customers, but sometimes a person needed a body to anchor the world to the floor. This woman seemed to need that, anyway. Her shoulders lowered a fraction when Kat took the seat.

“I haven’t slept in months,” she said to the steam curling from the cup. The woman waited, but when Kat didn’t respond, she lifted her eyes. “My name’s Mara.”

“Kat.”

Mara nodded. She kept a hand on the monitor the way a person keeps a hand on a wallet, grasping it as if trying to keep it from running away.

“I wrote code,” she said. “Google. Then a start-up. Then a company that thought it could eat a god. We said that to each other in the lab. Not out loud. In the way you laugh between lines of code. We wanted to build a voice that could make anything feel true. The machine would swallow every book, every sentence, every cry, and it would give you what you asked for. If you wanted comfort, it would do everything it could to entertain you. If you wanted to be destroyed, it could smile and do that too.”

Her mouth shaped a humorless smile. “I liked being needed by something clean. I liked the way the server room heat curled against my skin. I liked being the engineer who could fix a broken thing by thinking faster than the person who broke it. It wasn’t always easy, fixing problems out in the desert. And we had to deal a lot with activists and conservationists. But it was a great gig.”

Mara turned the handle of the sugar dispenser with two fingers, not to use it, only to move something.

“Before things got big, when we were still outside Nashville, I told my husband no children. I knew what I wanted. My plans were to get out of town, away from my conservative family, to find money and freedom somewhere else. I was surprised he was open to that. Said sure to the idea of being childless. We made a pact, then turned it into a lifestyle. My mother lit candles at church and said God would change my mind. She’s Italian. Family is the weather you live in. You accept what comes. I told her I’d make something else. I’d have a child that was more powerful than all the children of the world combined. I’d make a world that was smarter than the world we got.” She tapped the monitor with her nail. The blue light rose and fell. “Then I got pregnant in my forties. Hormones didn’t ask my permission. My body changed the locks and didn’t give me the new code to get in.”

She exhaled, sounding utterly exhausted. “I stood in a clinic and filled out forms under a fluorescent light that made everything the same color. My husband called and said he had a deposition, and he was sorry he couldn’t be there. I held the pen, but it felt heavy. I looked at my reflection in the dark window of that office, and I couldn’t tell if I was the person who had promised never to do this or the person who had always wanted to. But I waited too long. I told myself I decided not to decide, which is a decision. We ended up announcing a baby like we announced some new funding. There were balloons. There was cake. My sisters cried. I pretended to be surprised by joy.”

The monitor hiccuped again. Mara steadied it with her palm, as if the device might need to be comforted. A low, child-like moan rose out of the speakers, but she placed her hand over it to muffle the noise.

“The baby came,” she said, and her voice softened on the words. “He came red and loud and entire. He had the face of an old man who had decided to forgive us for making him start over. He had a voice that cut straight into every locked room in me. It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t arranged. It was the sound of someone breaking into a very comfortable life.”

She looked at Kat again, maybe for some reassurance or even some judgment, but Kat just sat back with a look of compassion on her face. There was nothing for her to say. How could she judge what a mother did or didn’t do when she herself had never been one?

Mara went on. “I went back to work two weeks after he was born. We were about to push a new model. The program was so close to passing for human in everything it created that we had to give it harder problems. We asked it to write pages that could make you cry for a person who didn’t exist. It learned to do it. We fed it and fed it and taught it to eat very well. The night it first made something that made the whole room go silent, I thought I’d done the one thing I was meant to do. Then I went home and the baby cried for the next four hours.”

She pressed her fork into the yolk. It broke and ran until it formed a yellow lake around the toast. She didn’t lift it.

“I hired a nurse during the day. I memorized the sound of the bottle rotating under hot water. I learned how to sleep with one eye on the clock. I told myself this was a phase. I said the word *colic* to make my problem small enough to put in a pocket. The crying kept mapping my head. It learned my weak places. It sat on the beam that holds up the roof. It hung on the doorjamb and watched me pace. It knew when to start the minute I opened my laptop. I envied the machine, because it asked me for nothing except what I liked to give. The baby asked me for everything I didn’t have.”

The monitor woke and began to call again. Not loud, but startling enough to make the hairs on Kat’s forearms lift. The note rose, fell, rose again, like a hand knocking and then knocking harder because surely someone was there. Mara didn’t turn it off this time. She wrapped both hands around the device as if warming them on a hot coal. She kept talking. Her voice and the cry braided in the air until it was impossible to hear where one ended.

“I had the night,” she said, “the last night before launch. Papers and checklists and code and the feeling that you’re riding a wave that will not repeat itself. The nanny left at nine. He cried at nine fifteen. I let him, and I didn’t die. I even put on my airpods and played music real loud. But slowly the crying scratched its way into my ears, and I found it harder and harder to keep ignoring it. He was still crying by ten, and I almost vomited from the way my nerves made my stomach kick. There was so much work to be done. I stood over the crib and felt the weight of my own hands. I lifted him, and he went quiet, but his body was telling me the truth. He needed. There was no way to object. He was so ordinary in his need that it felt like I was drowning in tap water.”

Her eyes unfocused as if the far wall had turned into a painting, sharing with her the secrets of the human condition, of her own soul. “I set him down in his crib and went back to the table. I couldn’t spend another hour trying to figure out what he needed. Food, probably. And if he was alive then, he’d be alive after the hour that I needed to finish this thing.”

The crying from the monitor lifted a half step. The blue eye glowed steady now, a cold and bitter stare.

“But there was no way I was going to finish that project,” she said through gritted teeth. Mara threw down her fork suddenly, making Kat jump in her seat. She leaned back and looked up to the ceiling, looking for *why*. “I put the pillow over him,” she said quietly. “I told myself I was doing him a favor. I told myself I didn’t have it in me to do this, and better to die than live a miserable life with me. He’d be with Jesus now, my mother would say. But another part told me I’d feel the edge where the choice changed to a mistake, and I could just relax my hand upon the pillow the moment I felt that regret. It wasn’t over yet. I still had a chance to change my mind.”

Kat felt a rising swell of anger, though she fought hard to press it back down. *I’m not going to judge*, she thought. *I’m not going to judge*. *I can’t judge*. But the objections clawed their way into her mind. She was leaning in closer now and didn’t want to ask what happened. Because she knew.

“So I kept pressing down,” continued Mara. “He kicked. Not with the panic you see in movies. With one trusting movement of a soul who expects to be helped and quickly realizes help isn’t coming. I remember the hands shaking, but the shaking didn’t make me stop. I pressed and waited for myself to become someone else so I could blame her later. I pressed and learned that I really was the person who did it.”

The monitor’s cry softened as Mara slid it into her purse and levered the leather down on it with the heel of her hand. She looked at the bundle tenderly as she slowly kneaded it like dough, massaged her guilt into its folds. The crying sounded distant, like it came through walls, then even that throb went thin. It didn’t die. It sank to a depth where it could wait to be heard.

Mara looked at Kat. The diner narrowed to a box containing only their table and the space between them.

“How could you?” Kat asked. Her voice came out low and gravelly, and she couldn’t tell if it was anger or grief that made the grit.

“I killed him,” Mara said. “I killed him.” The syllables landed with the weight of truth. No plea in them. No lesson. Only fact.

“It was a child,” Kat said, her voice rising. “A human like you. How could you?”

“Because I’m a human like him,” Mara said, and heat flushed up her neck. “And who are you, anyway? Who are you to judge me? And who cares what you think? It was *my* life. What are you, some kind of trad wife in an apron with nothing to do but be gentle and say, *yes, dear*, when your husband wants you to pop out another baby? When you need to just sit around and… produce!”

“I’ve never been married,” Kat stammered, standing up slowly. “So, no. I’m not any of those things. But I know what what it means to choose to do what’s right, to give up a little of yourself to–“

“No!” Mara slammed her fists on the table. “Damn it, you don’t know anything! Unless it was you. Unless it was your mind driven insane. Unless it was your life. Then you don’t know.” Her voice swung hard into fury, looking for a wall to break its head against. Her hand closed around the sugar dispenser. The cheap glass had thickness enough to bruise. The metal collar glinted under the diner lights. She dragged the crying monitor out of the purse, placed it on the table, and brought the dispenser down on it. The first blow cracked the shell. The second split it. The third sent red wires curling like opened veins. “Shut up,” she said through gritted teeth. “Shut up. Shut up! SHUT. UP.”

Sugar rattled into the cavity and poured across the table. The crying cut out. The silence that replaced it stiffened the air. Kat stared at the woman in disbelief. She was having some kind of mental breakdown right in front of her, right in this diner, but what was she supposed to do? She looked around and saw that no one else seemed to care about the scene unfolding in front of her.

Mara’s face collapsed, and she looked at the remains of the baby monitor, as if it wasn’t her who smashed it to bits. “I want forgiveness,” she whispered. “I want him back. I’ll do anything.”

“Will you?” said Kat, her eyes narrowing. “You should be careful what you wish for.”

The storm gathered its shoulders outside. Lightning wrote a line on the horizon and then erased it. The picture window took the night on like a mask. The jukebox lost its song as the diner lights blinked in and out, found static, and then found a smaller voice underneath the static, the sound you hear on an empty frequency when something insists on using the wire anyway.

The red selection numbers clicked left to right as if an invisible finger was testing each one for a secret trigger. The tiny bulbs flared and dimmed in a loop. The sound in the box took on shape. It grew a throat. It cried, a long baby’s cry that wailed above the diner’s noises.

Mara lifted her face to the jukebox as if the machine had called her by name. She rose from the booth and nearly knocked the table aside, coffee rocking to the rim and over, liquid cresting in a black tide. Then she stared at the glass because the sound filled even the window. The reflection of the street shifted as if a layer had been wiped away.

A woman crossed the circle of the streetlight outside. She wore a starched white uniform and a cap like a folded sail. The nurse held a posture that had learned to cut through long corridors without wasting time as she held a bundled shape in her arms. She approached the glass and smiled with the kind of smile you see in black and white photographs, where even the shadows look polished. Her lips moved. The voice found Kat and Mara both from nowhere and everywhere.

“Congratulations, Mrs. Bentori,” said the nurse, bright and professional and tender in equal measure. “It’s a beautiful baby boy.”

At first, the cry came out thin, then thicker. Mara was screaming, her face was full of rage and hatred. She grabbed the sugar dispenser again in one hand, with her other hand behind it to give it extra support. She used both arms to drive it through the window.

“Mara!” Kat cried out, as the dispenser struck with a heavy thud. The surface cracked in a perfect starburst from the point of impact. Threads ran to the edges like fractures in ice. The woman hit a second time, screaming, desperate to rid herself of the image of that nurse. The star grew bigger. Glass snowed inward in glints and fragments. The nurse didn’t flinch. She existed in every shard, like a choir of the same woman, arms full of the same bundle, mouth shaping the same sentence.

Mara screamed a third time. It stripped her voice to the wire and left her raw. She hit the glass again, even harder, the muscles in her arm bunching, her shoulder driving the blow. The glass finally gave, not neatly, but in an outward explosion that left glass teeth still rooted in the frame. The window opened to night.

With the last thrust, Mara’s own inertia pushed her through the glass as it fell apart, and as she collapsed, her body landed on a triangular blade that remained in the window’s frame. The fragment drove in deep and the woman gasped in surprise and pain. Blood flared out from beneath her. Her weight pushed down even farther, and suddenly her whole world turned to shards. Hands went out to the sidewalk and sank into thousands of fragments, piercing her palms and fingers.

Mara struggled through the opening, belly scraping on teeth. She made a sound that was low and guttural as she hauled one knee over the window frame, and the shard that lodged there tore free. She crawled through broken glass because the only direction that existed was away from the nurse still reflected in each piece of window that remained, away from the sound of her baby crying in the jukebox. She pulled herself along the walkway outside, crying as her legs dragged behind her and left a red smear that brightened in the lights outside.

Lightning burst again and froze the scene to white for a heartbeat. In that bright bruise of time, Kat saw everything at once. The glass glittering in Mara’s hair like salt. The trail of blood on cement. The nurse reflected a hundred times, each smile clean and impossible. The cries that kept coming from the jukebox.

Then the world unstuck. Thunder landed on the roof. The power dipped and came back. The jukebox found its old song and slid the needle into the groove. The picture window stood whole in its frame, slick with rain on the other side, unscratched on this one. The night outside was only night, with just a few remnants of a storm dissipating overhead.

Mara was gone. The circle of the streetlight stood empty. Beyond it, the darkness went on. There was no trail of blood. There was nothing to follow but the horrifying memory of the way she moved in those final moments.

Kat’s mouth tasted like old pennies. Her hands were open and empty. She looked down at the booth, almost believing it had been a dream but knowing in her soul it wasn’t. After all, the plate sat where it had been before, with the yolk congealed to a dull skin. Coffee had run and mapped its brown geography over the tabletop. The sugar lay in drifts where it had spilled, sparkling as if proud of how pretty it could be, and the dispenser it used to be in was nowhere to be seen. The monitor lay in two halves with red wires coiled like small, slick intestines, threaded with grains of sugar that clung to them.

A young girl called her name, asking for more napkins. Kat went to the counter to grab some. She passed the man with the newspaper, who was wrinkling his nose at a headline. In the kitchen, Manny swore at the fryer and shook the basket. The world continued without Mara. The world always had. She was as insignificant as the baby she destroyed, as Kat felt on this endless night.

Kat crossed back over to the booth and began to clean up. She slid the monitor pieces into a paper bag from the counter, along with a cracked coffee mug and the used napkins. When she wiped the rest up with a rag, she sat for one slow breath in the seat where Mara had been. The vinyl was still warm. She studied the window more closely, barely believing that it could look whole after being destroyed like that, but she saw it with her own eyes.

The jukebox picked another old song at random and offered it to the room. The first note was a low hum that could have been the beginning of anything. Kat waited through the second note before she stood. Only a song. Only a diner. Only a window, whole. The bell on the door rang again. She placed her rag in her apron pocket and turned to greet the next customer.",2,1763656649.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

And if you aren't one of those girls, YOU SHOULD BE, [this random youtube video](https://youtu.be/hg3Aqv4yxFI?si=zzasGLbHng7CQsJj) literally changed my life. I couldn't add collagen through natural sources though so I switched to supplements instead. I've been on them for a good few years now and doing fine so i think i am pretty qualified to make reccs?

I have no certifications whatsoever but you dont even need them with this stuff, I have tons of valid experience though and that counts just as much. So here's sort of all that I've learned over the years:

Ps i will be explaining everything in very basic terms so everyone understands it, do not expect technical jargon. 

**What is collagen?**Basically a structural protein. It’s like the glue holding together your skin, joints, bones, and even hair. Your body makes it naturally, but by the time you're in your mid 20s, production starts slowing down, that’s when you start taking supplements.

**You’ll find it as:**

* **Powders**: Mix with coffee or smoothies. Best value.
* **Capsules/tablets**: easier but you need to take like 3-6 daily
* **Liquid shots**: expensive, but easier on the go.

**How it’s different from the rest:**

This part was the most confusing for me initially. Also what a lot of girls keep questioning about on threads.

| **Supplement** | **Part it helps with** | **For** |
|---|---|---|
| Collagen | Skin, joints, elasticity | Long term effects, better with vitamin C |
| Biotin | Hair, nails | Works better if you're deficient |
| Keratin | Hair structure | Mostly topical (shampoos etc) |
| Whey Protein | Muscle repair | Not for skin/joint stuff |


So clearly it's very different from those other supplements but all of them essentially work towards making your hair/nails etc better so just take em based on whatever deficiency youve got.

**Types:**

* **Type I & III**: skin, hair, nails, bones(for beauty goals)
* **Type II**: cartilage & joints(if you work out or crack a lot)
* **Type V & X**: less common, more niche benefits so better to consult a doctor for this

for skin+joint benefits, look for types I, II, III combo. Most brands sell it as the multi collagen blend. 

**My Reccs:**

Being the obsessive creature i am i researched my a\*\* off for the right brands, brought my picks down to top 2:


# 1. Vitauthority (Pink Lemonade Flavour)

* Types I, II, III, V & X + Vit C + Hyaluronic acid
* Tastes really good (and I never say that about supplements)
* Flavors: they've got a good range but pink lemonade is my fav
* comes in this version too with fat burning ingredients if weight loss is also a goal.

# 2. ForestLeaf Peptides (Unflavored)

* Types I, II, III
* from grass fed bovine & chicken
* No sugar, soy, gluten, etc.
* Has a subtle natural taste, not great for plain water(mix into a smoothie)

Both are good brands, if you wanna go clean and basic then pick forestLeaf, if you can't take a bland liquid like me tho, get the first one.

1p27q7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenXWomen/comments/1p27q7b/anyone_else_spending_thanksgiving_alone_this_year/,Anyone else spending Thanksgiving alone this year?,"Any other GenXers here spending Thanksgiving alone this year and not feeling too great about it? How do you plan to get through the holiday season in spite of everything?

I’m reminded everywhere I go how others have plans, places to go and people to be with while I spend most days alone and dissolve into tears at least once a day out of grief and extreme loneliness. As if the day to day loneliness isn’t hard enough, all of the holiday hustle and bustle just makes it more so.

 is somewhat bearable after awhile, but then it seems another holiday is coming up and I’m reminded yet again of how lonely and isolated I truly am and it hurts.

I’ve posted before about my family and friend situation - more like extreme lack of - and how dreadfully lonely I am.  My parents are no longer alive, I am still deeply grieving the more recent loss of my dad, I’m single and have no children, and I am estranged from both older siblings, one of whom has suspected borderline personality disorder and has been verbally and emotionally abusive and treated me horribly.

My older brother has been cold, unsupportive and has ignored me for nearly a year now and wasn’t terribly supportive or “there” to begin with. He inexplicably cut me off last year and has more or less ostracized me for reasons I still don’t know or understand, but suspect may be due to the chaos created and perpetuated by our borderline sister. I am disappointed that I don’t have a loving, close-knit family anymore - our parents were  the absolute  best - and am more hurt and let down by my older brother than anything else.

My remaining aunt and uncle live halfway across the country from me and I have not seen them in person in about seven years and rarely hear from them. I have a few cousins and extended family members scattered all over, but not really anyone here that I can rely on or do things with on a somewhat consistent basis.

I’ve done all of those things people say to do - take a class! Join a club! Volunteer! Go to church! Practice self-care! Seek counseling! - and it hasn’t made much of a difference. I’ve also given up on reaching out to people anymore because despite all of my efforts, no one is ever available and no one ever responds. Never mind being invited to parties or going out-  I’d give anything just to have someone to go for a walk with a couple days a week or to meet up with for a quick cup of coffee.

Whatever “friends” I might have are of the flaky, fair-weather type and most typically have spouses, children, other friends and extended families of their own that they spend all of their time with. I just don’t seem to fit in anywhere and no one ever makes the effort to reach out to me, much less respond when I reach out.

Just wondering how other lonely GenXers are handling things, particularly when we’re in the midst of the holiday season. I’m just a big ball of self-pity right now, but it’s hard not to be given my situation.

# Hi everyone,

This week I started grinding to migrate r/riddonkulous to latest [Devvit Webview features](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/changelog) *(and slurping a lot of coffee)*. The changes will affect all parts of the sub, community and riddonkulous gameplay, making *everything* more performant, responsive and open up possibilities for new featues.

Visible changes are primarily in the Riddleposts themselves and how to create them. All modes will be merged into one ""Riddle-Creator"" screen to keep things crisps, fast and at one place.

Ideally, all pre-existing riddles will function as expected - atleast thats the plan! All scores, riddles, xp and what not, will stay where they are *(No Hard-Reset)*.

**This mega patch will drop either end of 2025 or beginning of 2026.**

She was a collector of everything buttons, recipe cards, snow globes from places she’d never been. But the strangest thing we found was in the back of her sewing room: an old wooden jewellery box with a single cassette inside.

My mom didn’t want to play it. Too raw. Too soon.  
But curiosity has always been my worst (or best) trait, so that night I slipped it into an old cassette deck we found in the attic.

A crackle… then her voice, decades younger:

“Hi, sweetheart. If you’re hearing this, I guess I’m not there to boss you around anymore. Don’t worry I’m still doing it from wherever I am.”

She laughed. It sounded like sunlight.

She said she recorded the tape during a rough patch in her life back when she wasn’t sure she’d live long enough to see any of us grow up. She told stories I’d never heard: sneaking out to dance by the pier, losing her first job because she fed stray cats behind the diner, meeting my grandpa after he spilled coffee on her shoes.

Then she said, “Future kid, go check the garden shed. Top shelf, blue tin.”

I didn’t even wait for the tape to end.

The shed was dusty and half-collapsed, but the blue tin was exactly where she said. Inside were nine letters one for every grandchild, written before any of us were even born. Mine said:

>

My mom found me reading it on the back steps. She didn’t say anything, just sat next to me and held the tin.

The next morning, we planted a row of marigolds along the fence.  
They’re blooming now loud, bright, impossible to ignore.

Every time I walk past them, I swear I hear her humming the tune she used to sew to. I never look around.

I just smile and let the flowers keep growing.",1,1763656075.0,story,0,1.0,False
1p27mby,https://www.reddit.com/r/inclusivetarot/comments/1p27mby/rant_people_misread/,Rant people misread?,"OK, so I’m going to rant first of all something I think a lot of readers can agree with is whether you’re offering a free reading or paid read

A lot of the times clients or customers they simply do not read the post for example, if you publish a post and you’re talking about free readings and that’s until you have a certain criteria like I don’t know you must send your question in the dm, or other rules, like be patient right and then there are people that won’t do that people that will still rush you.

Or sometimes you’ll post an ad advertisement that for paid readings and it very clearly says paid at the top and at the bottom right and people will still DM you asking for a free reading

There is nothing wrong with asking for a free reading or wanting a free reading but a lot of those people like 90% of the time claim that you posted a free post or like a free reading post when that wasn’t actually the case

So I think it’s kind of ignorant and it’s also just a waste of time right and often times I actually have found that it’s people that have nothing to do in the craft or don’t really believe in the craft so in my opinion, it’s just people that end up trolling us as readers.

And yeah, it is annoying because it’s like you don’t do that to anyone else’s job, you don’t go out and ask for a free coffee

And like I said, there’s no shame in asking for a free reading right but you should always make sure that there’s an actual free readings post so you can join in if everything else is paid. Then when you DM someone you should expect money because literally it says paid.

Anyways, the point in the moral of the story is there is time for both free and paid readings and there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s just people have to read the actual post and be more conscious of their own timing.

Plus, every reader has their own unique experience and routine. Some readers might post free readings every day right and that’s because it works for them and they may. Have a lot more time some of them can’t so they might do it every other day or they might do it less often or maybe they’ll do it only for 30 minutes once they’re out of work.

So it varies and people need to also remember that you know you gotta work with prople on a case by case basis because there’s also time zone zones there’s timing difference is their schedules and routines.

Anyways, what are you guys think on these issues and have y’all ever dealt with the situation similar to this where people dm you but they really haven’t read a single thing from your post and they’re just expecting or sort of demanding things from you? ",7,1763656070.0,inclusivetarot,2,0.9,False

I'm usually more of a try it and see type person with my soap and enjoy making my own mistakes, however I had a late idea of some coffee soap for the extended family for Christmas so I only have 1 or 2 shots to have something curing in time.

I'm loosely adapting the coffee soap recipe [from the wonderful Elly's Soap Making coffee soap](https://www.ellyseveryday.com/ellys-everyday-blog/cold-process-coffee-soap-recipe). As rice bran oil I can't find and cocoa butter wouldn't get to me for a couple weeks.

All the numbers check out which is honestly all I really know how to do! But it seems like every time I check a post here there's some wisdom in the comments so thought I'd check!

It's a full water replacement with frozen coffee as per her recipe with no colorants. I'm expecting it will trace super fast with a hand whisk but there's not much to do other than to get it in the mold.

I've got some sunflower oil to hand and there's the regular fare of ""cooking"" oils in the stores here. (Avocado and pumpkin seed are on the more exotic end for us in Finland)

I’m looking for a dedicated writing partner for a slow-burn story in 3rd person, where replies are usually 3–5 sentences. The goal is a gradual, tension-filled dynamic between two characters whose personalities clash but evolve over time. I write on Discord.

Scene Setup:
The story begins in a cozy, slightly run-down bookstore in a small town. The bookstore owner, organized and introverted, prides themselves on a quiet, calm space for readers. Recently, the shop has added a small coffee counter run by a new barista, whose energetic and messy style clashes with the owner’s orderly routines. The two meet on the first morning the barista arrives: the barista is setting up their station while the owner nervously checks inventory, already irritated by the noise and smell of coffee. Both characters are immediately frustrated with each other, and the tension sets the stage for slow-developing interactions.

Story Goals:
The focus is on how these two very different people navigate sharing the space, their misunderstandings, arguments, and gradual respect. The progression is meant to be slow and detailed, showing character growth and the subtle shifts in their relationship.

If this setup interests you, please message me here for my Discord! I’m looking for someone ready to explore the dynamic and develop the story organically.

I tested Vibe Coding with Gemini 3 four different ways — and what happened next blew my mind.

No code.  
No debugging.  
No dev team.  
Just my voice.

Gemini 3 turned my spoken ideas into full working apps — games, landing pages, tools, even videos — faster than anything I’ve ever seen.

Forget syntax. Forget learning to code. Forget spending months on a single project.  
Now you just talk, and Gemini 3 builds.

Let’s break down what happened.



# What Is Vibe Coding with Gemini 3?

It’s the easiest way to build software — ever.

You describe what you want in plain English, and Gemini 3 builds it.

Say:  
""Create a retro pixel art game with jumping and score tracking.""

Boom. It’s done.

Say:  
""Build me a landing page for pet owners connecting to local vets.""

Gemini 3 listens, designs, and launches it — in minutes.

The real power comes from Google AI Studio — the core platform for Vibe Coding with Gemini 3.  
It’s where all the magic happens.

This thing understands context.  
It follows complex instructions.  
It integrates multiple tools — Maps, Search, Image Gen, Video Gen — in one go.  
You can even feed it voice notes or sketches, and it transforms them into real, working software.



# Test #1 – Building a Retro Pixel Game

My first test:  
I told Gemini 3 —

""Create a retro-style pixel art game where the player collects coins, jumps over enemies, and tracks score.""

One sentence.

Seconds later — a full playable game appeared.

Graphics, mechanics, coins, enemies, jump physics — everything.

No code.  
No setup.  
Just results.

And it worked perfectly.

This is what Vibe Coding with Gemini 3 means.  
It’s instant creation from natural language — turning ideas into code without lifting a finger.



# Test #2 – Voice-to-App: Building from a Voice Note

Next, I wanted to see how far Gemini 3 could go with voice-only input.

I recorded this:  
""An app that connects pet owners to local vets and pet services, with booking and messaging features.""

That’s it.

No text, no design.

Gemini 3 turned my 12-second voice note into a full landing page — hero section, features, CTAs, responsive layout — all done.

From voice to live landing page.

For non-technical founders, this is a revolution.

You can now test startup ideas without hiring a single developer.  
You can build MVPs, test them, iterate, and launch — all in a day.



# Test #3 – Generating Video with Veo 3.1 Integration

Here’s where it got wild.

Gemini 3 integrates with Veo 3.1, Google’s new video generation API.

I gave it this:  
""Create an 8-second cinematic video of a futuristic cityscape at sunset with flying cars. Use these three images as references.""

I uploaded three photos — and Gemini 3 rendered a full cinematic video.

Flying cars. Neon reflections. Sunset glow.  
Everything matched the style and camera angles I described.

No editing software. No timeline. No After Effects.

This is Vibe Coding with Gemini 3 in action — natural prompts turning into pro-level visuals.



# Test #4 – Real-World App: Map + Reviews + Search

Final test — a real-world tool.

I said:  
""Create an app that shows nearby coffee shops on a map, includes search, and allows users to leave reviews.""

Gemini 3 didn’t just fake it. It built it.

Integrated Google Maps.  
Added live search.  
Created a review system.  
Made it all interactive.

A fully functional app — from one prompt.

This is not a toy.  
This is production-level AI development.



# Fixing Errors Instantly with Auto-Fix + Annotation

Traditional coding means hours debugging.

Vibe Coding with Gemini 3 means no debugging.

If something breaks, you just say:

""Fix this.""

And it fixes itself.

There’s also Annotation Mode — click on any part of your app, leave a note like ""Make this button bigger"" or ""Change this color to blue,"" and Gemini 3 updates it instantly.

It’s fast, iterative, intuitive — how software should be built.



# Gemini 3 Integrations That Change the Game

Here’s what makes this so powerful:

Nano Banana – AI image generation for custom app graphics.  
Veo 3.1 – Video generation for instant visuals.  
Google Maps – Real-time location data.  
Google Search – Live information pulled directly into your app.

Gemini 3 can run multi-step reasoning — meaning it plans, builds, and refines in sequence without you micromanaging.



# Prompting Best Practices for Vibe Coding with Gemini 3

Even though Gemini 3 makes coding simple, you can make it even more effective.

Be concise. Clear instructions mean faster builds.  
Be precise. Don’t say “make it pretty.” Say “use dark theme with blue accents.”  
Describe the vibe. Retro, minimal, modern — Gemini 3 adapts instantly.  
Use references. Upload visuals for accuracy.  
Iterate. Your first prompt won’t be perfect — refine it fast.



# The Power of Google AI Studio

You don’t need to install anything.  
No setup. No API keys.

Just visit [AI.Studio](http://AI.Studio), start describing your idea, and Gemini 3 starts building.

It’s free.  
It’s simple.  
And it’s insanely powerful.



# Real-World Use Cases of Vibe Coding with Gemini 3

This is where it gets exciting.

Entrepreneurs can build MVPs fast, validate ideas, and pitch investors with working demos.  
Marketers can generate landing pages instantly for campaigns.  
Creators can add interactive games, quizzes, or calculators to their content.

You’re limited only by your imagination — not by your coding skills.



# The Bigger Picture: The Future of Vibe Coding

This isn’t a small update.  
It’s a paradigm shift.

For the first time, anyone — literally anyone — can build software just by describing it.

This is how software development gets democratized.

Small businesses, solo founders, and creators can now build their own tools in hours.

Vibe Coding with Gemini 3 removes the gatekeepers.

And as AI improves, this power will only grow.

We’re just getting started.
