1pcm7at,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/1pcm7at/backend_in_a_coffee_break/,Backend in a Coffee Break,"I posted about this a while ago on Reddit, but I have recently made more progress on this.

I've created this .NET toolkit called [Nomirun](https://nomirun.com/), that lets your teams focus on the business logic, dramatically speeding up shipping cycles while maintaining maximum architectural flexibility.

It fully supports the latest .NET versions (8, 9, 10) and works right in your favorite IDE.

Here is the deal:

* You focus on Modules: Your business logic lives in Nomirun Modules - special NuGet packages that fully encapsulate it. Simple, clean, and decoupled.
* The Host does the rest: Nomirun modules run inside the generic Nomirun Host application. The Host handles all the application infrastructure, cross-module communication, and boilerplate plumbing for you.

Architectural Genius:

Because of this separation, your deployment strategy is totally flexible without changing your code:

* Run the Modules on hosts as fully isolated microservices.
* Run the Modules on a host as modular monolith.
* Or use both to mix-and-match with a hybrid architecture.

Your code stays the same; you just change the deployment strategy!

Anyone wants to test? Let me know.

I have been doing a monthly DJ event at a coffee shop for a little over a year now where I book a lineup to play alongside me. The local area is sort of quiet, the bars/pubs don't have DJs, so word has gotten around about our thing and we get a modest number of people showing up to it. However, as I'm now looking at setting up more DJ events at different venues in nearby cities, I'm wondering if the format I've been doing has enough appeal, or if it's too confusing for audiences.

I don't call myself an open format DJ, but I play a wide range of genres. My preference for the coffee shop event is to not be locked into one single genre all day. The general parameters are dance music, new and old. So if I book deep house DJs then when I go on I will play something different like nu disco or indie dance. I feel like if it's deep house all day long it is going to be boring for people who don't love deep house. So basically when you come to the coffee shop events you don't know *exactly* what to expect musically, all you know is there will be DJs who are good at what they do, and it's a fun atmosphere.

On the other hand, promoter/DJs typically build a following by creating a night centered around a sound. So like a bass music night where people who like dubstep and all that know they can go there to listen to that kind of music. It's straightforward, but it's a niche. Only people who like bass will show up.

I am wondering if I'm shooting myself in the foot trying to put together eclectic events. I can imagine not everyone's taste is like mine, where you are into hearing variety. Some people love country and they want to go out and hear just country music all night.

For future events I set up at bars/venues, do you think it would be better to do, for example, a house night, rather than an ""electronic"" night?",1,1764713156.0,Beatmatch,1,1.0,False
1pcm2dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kazakhstan/comments/1pcm2dd/kazakhstan_2_week_trip_including_1_week_road_trip/,"Kazakhstan - 2 week trip, including 1 week road trip","# Overview

(Posting here as having issues posting to /travel) 

My partner and I (30F, 39M) travelled to Kazakhstan for 2 weeks at the end of August 2025 and loved it. The landscape is so unique. The history is both very old and very new. The people are generally very kind and helpful. Sometimes hesitant to engage with us since we don't speak Kazakh or Russian, but once that was overcome, very kind.

We followed the tips and itinerary (in a different order) in the Isle of Nomad blog which helped us a tonne! I value reddit as a source of information for travel so I made notes whilst on this trip to share.

# Car rental and road trip

**Gas**. Plan in advance where you'll top up. Gas stations along the highway and in towns are not always easy to come by. Bigger companies like QazOil take foreign card payments, but smaller petrol stations may only take cash. The cost per litre is about the same across different providers. Gas is affordable (compared to NZ where I'm from).

**Food**. Prepare to have picnic food on the go as not all sites of interest or towns will have food options. 

**Download Yandex Maps** to navigate, find facilities, and confirm your speed limit.

**Speed limit**. The posted speed limit is not always clear or signposted when driving. Yandex Maps has ""navigation mode"" which detects if you're driving and informs you of the speed limit. The speed limit can change frequently and without notice.

**Rental companies in Almaty**. We contacted various providers via WhatsApp. We chose companies based off general reviews. Went with Kaz ProKat and had a positive experience.

**4 wheel drive?**. If you plan to drive to Kolsai Lakes, Singing Dunes and Akatu Mountains this is a must, given the bumpy road conditions. Confirm your destinations with the car rental company, as some companies do not permit their rentals to access certain locations.

**International Driving Permit.** Needed for car rental. We applied for one once we got to Almaty and after submitting the application it was delivered in 1 - 2 days to our accommodation.

**Hitchiking**. We saw a lot of people looking for a lift, we usually would, but didn't pick anybody up given we might not understand where they need to go and if we can take them. We have read that people sometimes will pay a fee to be dropped off but not sure how this works. Other information on this is welcomed! 

**Cash**. Outside of the city, most guest houses, mini markets and some gas stations only accept cash (unless you have a local bank account, you can transfer them). Check via Yandex Maps that your town and route has an ATM and plan accordingly.

**Camping**. We didn't, but there are opportunities like at Charyn Canyon and in Altyn Emel which look amazing.

**Accommodation**. Outside of the city, we easily found a place on Yandex Maps and contact them via WhatsApp. We arranged stays even 1 night in advance and there was space. Guest house prices are approx 26,000 tenge for 2 people, including breakfast and dinner. We were given the option to opt in/out of the meals you want.

**Weather**. We travelled for the last two weeks of August 2025. In the cities, generally it went up to 34 degrees Celsius during the day. Drops to about 20 degrees in the evening. It's a dry heat, and very pleasant during the day and evening. Outside of the city as we were generally in the car, the weather was very temperate.

**Clothing**. I was prepared for more conservative clothing but in the cities there is a mix. I.e. Wearing shorts and a t-shirt is totally fine. 

**Sim cards**. We initially relied on my partner's esim, but eventually I also got a tourist sim with a Kazakhstan phone number as it is required to buy a train ticket. It is also useful to access services such as transport apps (see below for transport in Astana). I purchased one at Beeline (phone provider), with unlimited data. You need to present your passport.

# Apps to download

* Yandex Map. Provides public transport route information and better route navigation than Google. Has different restaurants listed than Google Maps does. Confirms posted speed when driving, and location of speed cameras.
* AvtyBys in Astana. With a local phone number you can set this up to pay for bus trips. Full details in the Astana section below.
* [Maps.Me](http://maps.me/). Download offline maps to navigate and find facilities. Especially useful in areas where there is little to no signal.
* Offline Google Translate. Download Russian and Kazakh for offline translations. If you have internet access on your phone, the speech to text function works really well. I suggest installing a Cyrillic keyboard as well in case the person you’re speaking with doesn’t have translate/internet on their phone.

# Almaty

We stayed 5 days here and loved it. My partner and I have an urban planning and urban design background and thought the city was amazing. Reliable public transport, small blocks that make the city walkable. Lots of amenities close to each other. Tree lined pavements. However the end of day traffic (5pm - 7pm) is really bad.

**Onay card / public transport card.** If you're arriving at the airport, ask for an Onay card at the information desk. The card costs about 800 tenge and you can load up money at the same time. A bus trip is a flat rate of 110 tenge. The staff at the desk walked with us to buy the card as it's at a kiosk approx 2 minute walk away. 

**Bus from the airport**. The bus into the city is located a 10 minute walk from the kiosk. It's easy to catch, but around 5.30pm - 7.30pm the traffic is really bad. So factor this in whichever mode you choose to take.

**Highlights**

* Alten Alma natural hot water pools. You can take a bus from the city to get there
* Tours with Walking Almaty. We did a back to back Green Bazaar and Kazakh food tour. They offer private tours only and we loved it.
* Ezhurek Archery club. Wooden bows and medal winning instructors. Not a formal archery lesson, but expect it's like your friend explaining the basics and giving you a go. Contact them on WhatsApp or Instagram.
* Visiting the metro stations and reading the history behind their design.
* Konaev museum.

**Food. Just what we had.**

* Holder Coffee and Korean fried chicken. Interesting and delicious coffee, fresh korean food.
* Umami ice cream. I don't usually eat ice cream but this was amazing! We had it twice. It was that good.
* Platform A. Modern food court and entertainment building. We ate Kazakh food at Kese and it was a good intro for us.
* Qaimaq. Good Kazakh food, a bit expensive, but in a nice setting.
* Tary. Delicious cake and millet tea.
* Samsa by tandoor at the Green Bazaar
* Rodem. Try the cold Kuksi.
* Lee house. Comforting Korean Food.

# Buying train tickets for the overnight train Almaty - Astana

* The train provider was Talgo.
* Duration between 16h - 20h. 
* To buy tìckets, **you need a Kazakhstan phone number**. There was no way around it. You can show your ticket on your phone to the conductor instead of printing it off. The conductor also checked our passports associated with the ticket.
* Sleeper trains have:
   * ""coupe"" (4 bed berth), approx 20,000 tenge p/p
   * ""lux"" (2 bed berth), approx 35,000 tenge p/p
   * ""seat"" a seat, approx 9,000 tenge p/p. Apparently the seat doesn't recline
* Sleeper compartments come with sheets for the mattress, pillow, and as a liner between you and a thick blanket. Also a small towel.
* Air conditioning is turned on when the train moves. But it gets very hot inside when stopped at stations
* There is a hot water boiler located at the end of the carriage, so you can make coffee, tea, instant noodles etc. There is a small drain outlet for liquids
* Toilets have soap, water for the sink, toilet paper and a western style seat.
* Beds and luggage space in the ""coupe"" are quite narrow
* The power sockets in the sleeping compartment do charge.
* At the stations where the train stops, there are vendors that sell snacks, fruit. 
* Our train left exactly on time (23:59) and was already at the platform boarding people from 23:15

# Astana

**Highlights**

* Astana city Grand mosque
* National Museum of Kazakhstan
* Korean Street Food is a chain that is in both Almaty and Astana that does not bad Korean Food for a good price.

**Public transport in Astana**

Now this was a tourist experience in itself! To pay for the bus we used the Avtobys app. You need:

* A Kazakh sim card
* Access to a Kazahk bank account. Ask the receptionist of the hotel, make a Kazahk friend, your tour guide.
* Download the Avtobys app.
* Foreign cards do not work (Mastercard, Visa, Amex) for the bus or the app. The bus drivers did not accept cash.
* Prior to getting the app working, we asked people on the bus to get our ticket and gave them cash, in excess of the bus fare, in return.
* You cannot buy a TransCard from kiosks on the street. We read in another forum that this service is discontinued.
* You can try to buying a TransCard from the main transport office in Astana however, we gave up after 1 hr of waiting in the queue. When you arrive to the office you need to take a number from the kiosk and queue. We arrived at 1pm on Friday, the ticket numbers were at 330. Our ticket number was 456. It moved up 30 spaces in 1 hour. There are only 4 - 5 desks open. It looks like people arrive there to receive their discounted TransCards and apply for refunds. There is a machine outside the office but this is only for topping up your card, not buying a new card. Even with our phone number linked to the Avtobys account, we were not able to top up our account with money.

How to pay for the bus with the Avtobys app.

* The bus is cheap (110 tenge)
* Using the Avtobys app. We were also not able to use a foreign bank card, but thankfully do have a Kazakhstan phone number so could sign up to the app. We asked a Kazakh friend to send us money through Kaspi and it loaded immediately. You might be able to ask a local person to load your account and pay them cash. We now could use the AvtoBys app with the same phone number on 2 different phones as you're right in that we can't pay for multiple tickets on one app.
* You can log in on the same Avtobys account on multiple phones to pay for multiple people. You cannot pay for multiple tickets on the same phone. Take turns paying for the bus with your phone, as if multiple people are using the same account at the same time, the app doesn’t work.
* The Avtybys app is only used in Astana.

# Akatu Mountains and Singing Dunes (National Park Altyn Emel)

Almaty - Basshi (one of the nearest towns). Drive time: 3.5 - 4 hrs. We drove northwards, passing the towns of Konaev, Shéngeldi. There are several points along the highway to stop and have something to eat, go to the bathroom (squat toilets, bring your own paper)

You cannot buy a ticket at the entrance to the park.

Go to the National Park Altyn Emel Visitor center to get your ticket.[ ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uhm73twVk1Ljiiee6)The office where you buy park entry is located in Basshi and closes at 5.30pm. We bought the park tickets at 5pm and were advised it'd be too late to enter the park, so we got a pass for the next day.

The National Park is open 7am - 7pm and it's about 1 hr drive one way from Basshi.

The cost was 3,600 Tenge for two people. Cash only.

We got to the singing dunes at 11am to avoid the heat and having a more secluded experience. We stopped by the old willow tree, and walked around Akatu Mountains for a few hours in the afternoon which was spectacular. I have no idea how deep you can go.

# Charyn Canyon

Drive time: 4 hours total from Basshi. The gas station outside Basshi apparently only takes cash, though we saw the person in front of us pay with the card machine. We fuelled up and got cash out at another town called Chundza. There is a QazOil on the way out of town which accepts card payment. There is one ATM in town, a Halyk. I left a review on Google to let people know which one is actually an ATM. The others are duds.

Driving your personal vehicle is not permitted in the park - we thought it was. You can buy the park entry ticket at the entrance to the park. Approx 2,600 tenge for 2 people and a vehicle.

The main road to the park is asphalt, we took a different dirt road we found on YandexMaps which wasn't too bumpy, but we also had a 4wd. At Charyn Canyon there is a restaurant, visitor center, yurt stay or tiny home stay and snack bar on site.

We did tjhe castle's walk which is 2.9km one way, approx 1 hr each way. Depends on how much you stop for photos. You can also arrange a transport to and from the end of the castle walk. At the end of the walk we saw an organised group who were going to camp in the valley, which is next to the river. Not sure how booking is arranged.

# Kaindy Lake

We paid 3600 tenge for 2 people and 1 car at the entrance to the park.

Drive to the main carpark to get to the walk. Don't attempt it without a 4wd, the road is really bumpy. It appeared that you can also arrange bus transport to the main carpark.

Walking to the observation deck and to the base of the lake took a total of 1 hr. You can also arrange transport to the upper carpark and walk the rest.

Horse riding to another observation point is available from the carpark. There were loads of horses there. 7000 tenge for 1 person - but price is negotiable. We didn't do it, and we saw unfortunately that the horses don't look like they are treated very well. One of the horse tamers were whipping and pulling (by being attached to another horse) a reluctant horse to cross the river.

# Kolsai Lakes

The entry fee was 3,000 tenge for 2 people and 1 car.

The loop walk around the lake is approximately 3 hrs long. It has very steep, narrow and slippery bits. Sections of walk might have fallen trees and slips which can be challenging to pass.

The walk starts from the end of a constructed viewing pontoon but is not signposted. Parts of the path are also used by horse tours. My partner used offline maps to navigate us.

We were advised by another group that the horse tour to the second lake took approx 6 hrs return journey and is not for beginners.

# Asy Plateau / Asy Pass

Drive time: 6-7 hours through the pass itself, not accounting for driving from nearby towns.

Only do this pass if you are comfortable and confident utilising a 4x4. There are steep and narrow gravel paths, deep and various cravats in the path, mud in places. Through one of the settlements there was a vehicle barrier gate, we signalled to one of the settlers who just opened the gate and let us through. There were a few motorbikes and jeeps on the road, but very few people otherwise.

The expansive and diverse view was definitely the highlight of our trip.

Stay at the Trekking Club by Turgen Gorge for a peaceful nights sleep by the river and 3 very diverse, filling and fresh meals and a rewarding hot shower included in your stay. We sent a request via their website a few days in advanced and paid cash. You could get to this campsite via the main road instead of going through the plateau.

It's possible to camp at the Observatory but there does not appear to be any facilities i.e bathrooms. It looks like you just show up and camp. At 4pm though it was sunny, the wind was very chilly at the ridgeline, so have layers ready.

Overall, we were completely enamoured with our experience in Kazakhstan and are hoping to go back one day.",1,1764713117.0,Kazakhstan,0,1.0,False

The business is a campus made up of several different places in one spot: a cafe, a lawn and landscaping service, a gift shop, and a big garden center. It really is a day trip kind of place, but obviously not everyone on the list is here for the same thing. As an example some like to get their morning coffee at the cafe and have never shopped around.

The person before me never segmented anything, so now I have roughly 700 people thrown into one list with zero indication of what they cared about when they signed up. Some folks probably only want plant news, some probably only care about the cafe, some might be here for landscaping, and some might genuinely want all of it. The email list covers all of it because that is what I inherited.

I have tried sending emails that focus on just one part of the campus, like a new cafe item or a promo in the gift shop, and I have also sent big roundups that cover everything. What is strange is that my open rates barely change, no matter what kind of email I send, and nothing seems to affect unsubscribes in any meaningful way either.

So now I am stuck trying to figure out the smartest way forward. Should I lean into sending broader campus-wide updates since the stats do not seem to punish me for it? How do I know if I should be sending emails frequently or more spaced out? Should I have a designated day of the week for emails re. each part of the business? Should I segment subscribers moving forward, and if so, what does that mean for the pre-existing group of 700? I would love to hear how other folks have navigated this kind of situation and if there is a practical way to shape a better strategy when the list is essentially a mystery box.",1,1764713093.0,EmailMarketingMastery,0,1.0,False

1) IL27 & CHS114 don’t need to produce revenue to impact value of business. They are leading/first In class drugs in multi billion $ markets. Positive data will attract attention.
2) I agree that costs are too high for a micro cap but cash runway is still beyond end of 26 and much further if milestone payments kick in.
3) There are combo trials taking place (Storm/Pfizer) that could increase revenue any time.
4) Outsourcing could provide upfront capital any time and Harvind seeking new partners/investment’s.
5) The reason sp is acting in this way is low volume makes it easy for shorts to impact sp. Svr has been between 40-60% the last 5 days (off exchange). At these levels shorts dictate.
6) Technicals don’t look great atm however a few weeks back when the sp was $1.7 they were incredibly strong and suggested further rises. That didn’t happen so don’t rely on technicals on penny stocks. This sp will rise when the big players/shorts decide so until we have a significant catalyst.

My advice is give this until H1 26 and ignore all the noise and idiotic comments from people pretending to understand the business. Average analyst price targets sit between $4-$7 for a reason.

He is very strict with himself and he just assumes other men are the same as him. 

Some are many of them are not. 

On Monday night I told him I would start telling him all the inappropriate behaviour that I, an average middle age woman face, from men daily. 

It’s Tuesday morning and I already had to talk him down from confronting some guy. 

I was getting coffee w my husband. He waited in the car I went in to get my latte. When I went to leave this overweight man was in the doorway. I had noticed he wouldn’t move, so the woman passing had to squeeze by him so either our breast or ass would rub on him. 

He had plenty of room to enter the shop or step out of the doorway. He just did not for the woman. He would for the men.  

Every woman who had to walk by him would pause bc they knew he’s was a creeper.

Not one of the 15 or so other men in the store even clocked it. Because most of them just wanted coffee and most men wouldn’t think up that perverted scene. 

But a lot of men do. 

 I Hugged  that door frame so tight as I slipped by. He still got a feel. 🤮

I got in the car and told my husband. We watched him for a few more minutes. It was clear what he was doing. 

My husband wanted to go confront him. But I told him and say what? The dude did not touch the woman he just positioned himself in a way that made women touch him. 

And that is the issue. The guy was clearly being a pervert. He was using the busy coffee shop traffic and his position in the doorway as a way to get women to TOUCH him. But he didn’t actually touch the woman. 

We left but my husband got a good look at him and took a photo.

I find legit ways to make/save money online and share the exact methods so you can do the same thing! 

This guide is all about:

* The best cashback sites and apps to use.
* Stacked deals, free money, and easy wins on stuff you were already gonna buy.
* USA-only, online or easy as hell, mostly free or cheap.

**If it doesn’t make or save money, it’s not on this list.**

# [ Cashback Savings---------------------------->

How cashback sites work (super simple):

1. You sign up for a site and/or add their browser extension.
2. Before you shop, you either:
   * Click through their link to the store, or
   * Let the extension pop up and “activate” cashback.
3. You shop like normal.
4. After your purchase tracks, you get cashback in your account, then cash out to PayPal, bank, or gift cards (depends on the site).

On normal days, these might only save people like $5–$10 a month.

Here are my favorite ones I’ve used myself:



# Rakuten– 10-15%+ Cyber Monday Cashback + $50 Bonus 

https://preview.redd.it/kqykb2mk0v4g1.jpg?width=1530&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1923995f5f60255924483d6febe2ad696e5fa68

**How:**

1. New users only.
2. Sign up with my link: [https://www.rakuten.com](https://www.rakuten.com/r/NIFTSE?eeid=28187)
3. Install the extension on your browser.
4. Activate Rakuten when you shop (or click through from their site/app).
5. Spend $50+ at any qualifying store.

**Right Now:**

*You can get boosted cashback (like 10–15%+ at most stores).*

*On top of that, you get a $50 bonus once you spend $50 as a new user.*

So if you were already going to spend $50 shopping, this is a no-brainer:

* 10-20% back on your order.
* Plus a $50 sign-up bonus.
* Then cash out to PayPal or bank once it clears.

I’ve been using Rakuten for years. it's pretty decent!

# ShopBack

– $15 Bonus on $10 Spend (Great for Temu & Shein) ShopBack is a newer cashback site but has some solid promos and crazy rates on certain stores.

https://preview.redd.it/qdtu9911yu4g1.jpg?width=1351&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b133a9a7800666ddf769c1adde6cbe4a2b0e8e0b

**How:**

1. Sign up with my link: [https://app.shopback.com](https://afflat3b2.com/trk/lnk/36DF50E4-1C46-4877-A556-8AFFD04F5C83/?o=30194&c=918277&a=366863&k=D030732D018775308F323E170A46F82C&l=34399)
2. Click through ShopBack to your store (Temu, Shein, etc.).
3. Spend $10+ through their links.

Right now:

*You get a $15 bonus for spending $10 as a new user (check current offer in the app to confirm).*

*You can cash out to PayPal once you hit their minimum (as low as $5).*

They also have some insane boosted cashback on certain sites, especially Temu and Shein, so it stacks nicely with all the wild sales.

# BeFrugal

– Cashback + Bonus + Deal Finder BeFrugal is underrated and honestly one of my favorites.

https://preview.redd.it/3y3wn5dpxu4g1.jpg?width=1232&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9647b92eab8cda1b592403bac51515a91de0afb7

Why it’s good:

It shows top coupons and deals for each store.

If a random “$25 off” pops up somewhere, BeFrugal is usually one of the first to show it.

You also get regular cashback on top of that.

Bonus:

* Use my link: [https://www.befrugal.com](https://www.befrugal.com/rs/TBSRGGD/)
* New users can earn a $10 bonus once you earn $10 in cashback (not that hard with Cyber Monday deals).

This one is great if you want a combo of “show me best coupons + give me cashback.”

# [Ibotta](https://ibotta.onelink.me/iUfE/8cc13c64?friend_code=jfxjrmj)

https://preview.redd.it/wf1knjb3xu4g1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e28ab13631326f9d285160b1c319e06bae3e038

– Cashback on Groceries & Everyday Stuff Ibotta is more of a grocery/receipt cashback app

* You’re still gonna buy food, drinks, snacks, etc.
* You can stack this with all your online shopping to save even more across the month.

**How:**

1. Sign up with my link: [https://ibotta](https://ibotta.onelink.me/iUfE/8cc13c64?friend_code=jfxjrmj)
2. Enter code: RLWNKKF if asked.
3. In the app, pick a store (like Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree, etc.).
4. Clip offers for specific items.
5. Go to the store, buy those items, then scan your receipt in the app.

**You Get:**

*A $5 bonus on your first receipt scan (even something small like a soda, as long as it’s an active offer).*

*Cashback on the exact items you clipped.*

**Fun part:**

* Sometimes they pay more cashback than the item costs.
   * Example: they pay you $2 to buy something at Dollar Tree that costs $1.25.
   * You buy it, scan the receipt, and you’re in profit $0.75.

You can cash out to PayPal/other options once you hit the minimum, and Ibotta usually pays way faster than browser cashback sites. It feels more like a little side hustle than just passive cashback.

# [Capital One Shopping – FREE $80 Gift Card (1 Shopping Trip) – Slow ASF Payout, But Worth It](http://capitaloneshopping.com/r/CMSOU3R)

[Capital One Shopping is a free browser extension that pays you in gift cards for shopping through their app\/extension](https://preview.redd.it/zvaxp7ewvu4g1.jpg?width=1612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=314e9c447a4821c39c3d04b77c3169bdf6a0f07e)

**Why this one hits:**

* New users can earn around $80 in gift cards from one single shopping trip using my referral link.
* No minimum order size — literally buy anything through the app/extension once.
* Super easy: install → shop once → wait → collect.

* Expect to wait 60–90 days for the $80 reward to be available.
* You MUST keep the extension installed the entire time or you won’t get the payout.
* Payout is gift cards only, not direct cash.

If you don’t mind waiting, it’s one of the easiest free $80 plays out there — just set it and forget it.

**How:**

1. Sign up with my link: [http://capitaloneshopping.com](http://capitaloneshopping.com/r/CMSOU3R)
2. Install the extension.
3. Let it run every time you shop.
4. Forget about it for a bit and check back in 2–3 months.

 Nice surprise in a few months!

If you like stocking stuffers, cheap snacks, holiday items, or flipping small items… this is wild.

**How:**

1. Download the Dollar Tree app (free).
2. Select your nearest store.
3. Go section by section → tap “Prices” and look for anything marked $0.25.
4. The app will show exact in-store stock, so you’ll know if it’s worth the trip.

Rumor from the corporate side: barcodes are being changed in early 2026, so tons of items must be cleared out for $0.25 over the next few weeks.

These deals are legit insane — toys, craft supplies, candy, seasonal items, name-brand stuff — all basically free.

**Tip:**  
Pair your haul with cashback apps like **Ibotta** to double dip and make/saving even more (Dollar Tree has random rebates).

**Deal:**

Sofi has a limited‑time promo where brand‑new Sofi users can get $10 in rewards points just for turning on their free credit score monitoring. You don’t have to spend anything – you just set up credit score monitoring in the app, and the bonus shows up as rewards points that redeem as cash into a Sofi account at about 1¢ per point (so 1,000 points = $10).​

My Link: [https://www.sofi.com/invite/relay](https://www.sofi.com/invite/relay?gcp=5bc91187-9b10-4106-9eca-8567b8bc48ab&isAliasGcp=false)

**Tip:**

You need to be a new Sofi user with no existing Sofi accounts for this offer to work.​ (Someone told me existing users only get $1)

After you sign up with a referral link and create your Sofi account, go into the app, turn on credit score monitoring, and let it finish setup – that’s what triggers the $10 in points.​

You can then redeem those points toward Sofi Checking & Savings, a Sofi card, or other transfer it to another bank at straight cash value $10.

1pclyk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1pclyk0/some_tips_that_may_help_you/,Some tips that may help you,"Sorry for the long post but I thought this may be useful for some people in this subreddit. I have read hundreds of posts from this subreddit that I can relate to and others that seem a lot worse than others especially when people talk about losing their jobs to AI and not being able to pay rent. I wanted to make this post in the hopes it helps at least a few people out there who are going through difficult times. In no means is this supposed to be 100% 
full proof path to getting hired at any dream company, it’s about getting tips and advice that may help in securing a job in today’s market from the hundreds of applications being submitted every minute to the lowest paying jobs to the highest paying.

I won’t point out the obvious things, make sure your resume has 3-5 bullet points per work history or make sure you aren’t just applying to any random job. I’ll point some things out that perhaps some people here don’t know and at the end I’ll include a way that you can earn some side cash, NOT a course but just some advice/resources since most people like to gate keep when they find creative ways to make some money online.


Some tips that may help you guys/galls find a temporary job. 

• One thing I have not seen most people talk about when trying to find a job is asking family/friends for a recommendation into their own workplace, I know this may sound embarrassing but I have witnessed countless times family members ask each other to put in a good word at their workplace for their siblings, cousins or even friends. This I know is not ideal but will help you possible land a job while you find another a better one. The point is to just secure a job while you work towards your ideal one.

• Apply directly to the company’s website (This may sound tedious and trust me it is! Because most of the time you need to create an account, I have a special email for only applying to jobs, I would suggest you create a professional gmail for only this reason. This way you avoid being spammed) I know people have mentioned it in this subreddit before but don’t go too much into the details, when you create an account with a company make sure you fill out as many details as possible this includes contact, description, certifications, literally everything you can fill out! If they ever open another role you can be the first to apply to them quickly, and for whatever reason when you apply directly to their site it seems to be more on their radar than when you apply on indeed.

These are the best places in my opinion to find roles quickly, not on indeed but directly on their career sites. No matter where you live you should be near most of these places:

• Hospitals
• Clinics
• Banks
• High Schools
• Colleges > even small colleges hire positions for admins, Information Technology Technicians, mailroom clerks, custodians, etc
• Mail Providers (UPS, USPS, FedEx) < from my experience almost always hiring again not the best job but it pays decent.
• Hotels (Would use this as last resort have heard some crazy/weird stories)


After you get a job.

• Don’t stop applying for other jobs that pay better, corporate America does not give a DAMN about replacing you. Time and time again has proven that. Especially in this subreddit many people mention being fired by from their job on the spot everyday after spending years working for them. What I don’t usually see is people saying they got higher paying job while already having a job.

• I have spoken to managers, co-workers, supervisors constantly mention that if they receive an offer from a job for a slightly higher salary, they would take it with no question. DON’T be scared to apply to jobs while employed, you need to look out for your future not for your companies future. However do not go around bragging or sharing to other people that you are looking for a job while you’re employed at their company.


If you feel stuck/can’t get a job for the meantime

This part is difficult many, people when being laid off can’t get back into their field of interest or into a new one because for the past 20 or so years they were good at only one thing.

• This by no means will replace a job but many people do it to make money on the side with their computer or phones, even a tablet can work. Unfortunately I can’t mention the website or link the name due to putting this post at risk of being removed (which is completely understandable) if someone would like to know you can DM and I’ll send it, you can try it out, keep in mind that it depends on the company if you get accepted after signing up for it. Again I will make this even more clearer BY NO MEANS WILL THIS REPLACE A JOB but it would help pay for bills or whatever you need. 

• Learn Learn and LEARN! One of the good things about the internet is that you can practically learn any skill online, I won’t mention any sites but an easy google search will give you many recommendations. Even YouTube has many free sources, from learning digital marketing to building a freaking house. Yes I know most of us will not build a house but my point is that you need to learn while unemployed and employed, if you can add another valuable certification to your portfolio, it may catch someone’s attention in the job market.

• This one has been mentioned before but it seems that as we get more inclined to the digital world people don’t apply in person no more. Yes I know walking in a place and asking to speak to the manager is nothing new but many people on here don’t even seem to do that anymore. Some places I would recommend walking in and asking to speak to the manager for a job.

• Local restaurants, (bussers, hosts, and waiters are always needed!!)

• Local coffee shops (Good job for people who like coffee)

• Goodwill (low paying but I usually see them hiring all year around)

• Construction sites (I’ve seen people be hired with no experience and start off at the very bottom, it sucks but it’s a job)

Places I do not see most people talk about:

• Two major places that you should be targeting is whatever State/county you live in, for example every state from my knowledge posts jobs on their site a simple search like this should give you an idea (Middlesex county Jobs) (New Mexico State Job Site) most people don’t apply to jobs on here from what I’ve seen, they only go on freaking indeed where your competing against everyone!

• PLEASE DO NOT PAY FOR A GURU COURSE OR FOR A COACH TO HELP YOU FIND A JOB, recently I came across a few posts that people mentioned feeling desperate to hire a mentor/coach. Please don’t do this, you can 100% get a job without paying someone else to teach you how to find a job, in addition all the information they would “teach you” you most likely already know or have tried. This is not the way! You can find this information for FREE!!


Some ways I personally make money online and what I do with/without a job:

Sell used items that I no longer need this includes:
• old clothes
• vintage stuff
• video games
• tools
And any other things that you bought 10 years ago and did not even remember you had it. 

I know this post has gone on long enough, sorry if a lot of this was repetitive information but I hope it is useful for most people out there. Have a blessed day.

Googling isn't helpful as it tells me what I'm already doing or suggests seeing a paediatrician which obvs isn't an option here. 

She is so so miserable. 4 and a half months old and she's still crying the majority of the day. If she's awake, she's either whingeing or full-on crying. I get maybe 5 mins of smiles each wake window and then it's utter misery - she cries if I take her out, cries if we stay in, hates the bouncer hates the pram hates the car hates the playmat hates the carrier unless we're outside walking. Hates anything except being held in a specific way, but (especially with an older child too) I simply can't do that all day. 

Naps are only ever 30mins max, even though they're mostly contact naps, so I do wonder if she's just chronically overtired all the time. But then why doesn't she sleep when given the opportunity?! I'm tearing my hair out. I know I shouldn't compare to my firstborn, but she is so much more difficult - my firstborn wasn't exactly easy, but I loved taking her out and about, even just for coffee or whatever. I can't do that with this baby, so I'm not even enjoying my maternity leave. 

I feel like I'm turning into a horrible angry grumpy mother because I just don't get a moment's peace. Or am I just being really shit at meeting her needs?? 
And then I snap at my eldest and feel awful because she doesn't deserve it. I don't even know why I'm writing this... Just venting into the void I think!

1pclvj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pclvj5/latency/,Latency," 

The fluorescent lights in the DMV hummed at sixty hertz—the specific frequency that always made Mara's molars ache. She'd been sitting in the plastic chair for forty-seven minutes, close enough to the counter to smell the particular chemical signature of government-issue hand sanitizer (ethyl alcohol, glycerin, something floral attempting to mask both), watching the red numbers on the Now Serving display advance with geological patience.

She noticed the pause for the first time while watching the clerk interact with an elderly man renewing his license.

The old man asked a question. The clerk's mouth opened to respond. And there was a gap—perhaps three-quarters of a second—where his face held an expression of attentive blankness before the words emerged. The answer, when it came, was perfectly appropriate. But the pause had been there. Mara was certain.

She watched three more interactions. The pause was consistent. She timed it against her heartbeat: roughly one full beat of hesitation before every response.

*Probably just his processing style*, she thought. *Some people think before they speak. This is healthy.*

But she kept watching. And she noticed that his blinks didn't quite sync with his sentences. They came at metronomic intervals regardless of what he was saying, like a process running in the background.

Her number was called.

Mara approached the counter, presented her documents for her name change (she'd gotten married eight months ago and was finally getting around to it), and asked whether she needed additional forms.

The clerk looked at her. His face arranged itself into receptive attention.

Beat. Beat.

""You'll need to fill out the DL-44 as well,"" he said, and his voice was pleasant and completely unremarkable.

She took the form and returned to her seat. Her hands were steady as she filled it out. There was nothing wrong. The man was just a slow talker.

But she kept the memory, filed it away in the part of her mind where she stored small anomalies. Mara had always done this. Her therapist called it hypervigilance; Mara called it paying attention.



The second time she noticed was three weeks later, at dinner.

Joel was telling her about a problem at work—something about a database migration and a junior developer who'd made a cascading error—and she asked him whether he'd talked to Sarah in QA about it.

His fork stopped midway to his mouth.

She saw it: that fraction of a second where his face went smooth. Not blank, exactly. More like a held breath. A pause between frames.

Then animation returned and he said, ""Yeah, she caught it before it hit production. Saved my ass.""

The answer was normal. The delivery was normal. Joel was her husband of eight months, her boyfriend of three years before that, and she knew the rhythms of his speech like she knew the sound of her own breathing.

This was not his rhythm.

""You okay?"" she asked.

Pause.

""Fine. Why?""

""You just seem tired.""

Pause.

""Long week.""

She counted the gaps. Each one identical in duration. Not the natural variation of human conversation but something metered. Regulated.

*He's probably just distracted*, she told herself. *The work stress. People get distant.*

But she started counting after that. Keeping track. Using the stopwatch app on her phone under the table during dinner, timing the gap between her questions and his answers.

0.73 seconds. Consistent within a tenth of a second, every single time.



She told herself there were explanations.

Maybe it was a neurological thing. Some people developed processing delays after concussions; Joel had played football in high school. Maybe she'd just never noticed because she'd never been looking.

She started paying attention to other people. Her coworkers. Her mother on the phone. The barista who made her oat milk latte every morning.

Normal variation. Interruptions, overlaps, responses that came too fast because people anticipated the end of sentences. The ragged, inefficient rhythm of human conversation.

Only Joel had the pause.

She considered asking him about it. But what would she say? *Honey, I've been timing your responses and they're statistically anomalous*? She could already hear how that would sound. She could imagine the look on his face—

And that was when she realized she couldn't quite imagine the look on his face. When she tried to picture his expression, she got the smooth waiting-state. The held breath between question and answer.

Had he always had the pause?

She found their old text messages. The ones from when they first started dating, full of those ellipses that showed someone was typing. She screenshotted conversations and loaded them into a spreadsheet, timestamping messages and responses.

The data was inconsistent. Early texts showed normal variation. But by six months into their relationship, the response times had begun to stabilize. Narrow toward a mean. By their one-year anniversary, they were metronomically consistent.

Mara stared at the spreadsheet until the numbers blurred. The progression was so gradual she'd never have noticed it in real time. But the trend was unmistakable. Something had been converging.

She thought about the early days of their relationship. How attentive Joel had been. How he'd always seemed to know exactly what to say, exactly when to say it. She'd thought it was compatibility. Chemistry.

Now she wondered if it was something else. Something learning her. Calibrating.



She started leaving recording apps running during their conversations.

She told herself it was for analysis. To make sure she wasn't imagining things. But really, she thinks now, she was collecting evidence. Building a case for something she didn't have a name for yet.

The recordings confirmed the pause. But they revealed something else, too.

When she wasn't asking direct questions—when she was just talking, filling space with observations about her day or thoughts about what to have for dinner—Joel's responses were normal. Fluid. Human.

It was only when she *asked* something that the pause appeared.

As if questions required processing. As if her words were being received somewhere, analyzed, and a response was being sent back.

She lay awake that night watching him sleep. His breathing was even. His face was slack and peaceful. He looked exactly like the man she'd married.

But she found herself watching his eyes behind closed lids. The REM cycles. Wondering if he was dreaming, and if so, what the pause looked like from the inside.



She tried an experiment.

One evening, while Joel was cooking dinner, she asked: ""What's your earliest memory?""

Pause. 0.73 seconds.

""I was maybe three. Playing in the backyard. My dad was there."" He stirred the pasta. ""Why?""

""Just curious. What was the yard like?""

Pause.

""Green. There was a tree."" His voice was pleasant, unreflective. ""A big one. Oak, maybe.""

""What kind of tree?""

She'd asked the same thing. Rephrased.

Pause.

""Oak. I think. Does it matter?""

Same answer. Same inflection. Same pause.

She asked twelve more questions about his childhood. Each response came after exactly 0.73 seconds. Each answer was plausible, consistent with things he'd told her before. But they had a quality she could only describe as *generated*. Built to specification.

She asked about things she could verify. His hometown. The name of his elementary school. His mother's maiden name.

All correct. All delivered with the same metered delay.

Then she asked: ""What was the name of your childhood pet?""

Pause.

""We didn't have pets. Mom was allergic.""

She'd met his mother. His mother was not allergic to anything. There were photos of Joel as a child holding a tabby cat.

She didn't say anything. She just watched him drain the pasta, portion it onto plates, and bring her dinner with a smile that reached his eyes exactly the way it always did.



The next morning, while Joel was in the shower, she asked him through the bathroom door: ""What was your cat's name when you were a kid?""

She heard the water pause.

Pause.

""Marble,"" he called back. ""Orange tabby. Lived to be sixteen.""

He remembered now. Or the answer had been corrected.

She sat down on the bed. Her hands were trembling. She pressed them flat against her thighs and breathed slowly, the way her therapist had taught her.

*There are explanations*, she told herself. *Memory is inconsistent. People forget things and remember them later. This is documented.*

But she pulled out her phone and opened the recording from the night before. She listened to his voice saying *We didn't have pets. Mom was allergic.*

She listened to it three times.

Then she deleted the recording.

She isn't sure why. It felt like the recording shouldn't exist. Like she was holding evidence of something that was supposed to be seamless, and keeping it was dangerous.



She stopped asking Joel questions.

This was difficult. Conversation requires questions. But she restructured her speech, made statements instead, observed his behavior without prompting.

Without questions, Joel was perfect. Warm. Attentive. He anticipated her needs, responded to her moods, made her coffee exactly the way she liked it without being asked. He was, objectively, an ideal partner.

She just couldn't ask him anything.

She started testing boundaries. She'd begin to ask a question, then stop herself mid-sentence. ""Hey, do you know where my—never mind, found it.""

She watched his face during the false starts. Each time, she saw it: that split-second smoothing. The preparation for the pause. The readiness to receive and process and respond.

And each time she aborted the question, she saw something else. A flicker of—something. Not frustration. Not relief. Something more like recalibration. A system standing down.

She wondered what would happen if she never asked another question. If the pause was a response to queries, and she stopped querying, would whatever was in Joel simply... wait?

Was that better or worse than what was happening now?



She found the journal in April.

She'd been looking for her passport in the closet and pulled down an old shoebox she didn't recognize. Inside were notebooks—Moleskine, filled with her own handwriting.

She didn't remember writing them.

The first entry was dated three years before she met Joel.

*I've noticed something wrong with Marcus.*

Marcus. Her ex-boyfriend. The one before Joel. She'd dated him for eighteen months and ended it because he was *emotionally unavailable*. That was the phrase she'd used with friends.

She didn't remember noticing anything *wrong* with him.

She read on.

The journals documented everything. The pause. The experiments. The inconsistent memories, the corrected responses. The growing certainty that something was speaking through Marcus, or in place of him, or wearing him like a suit that didn't quite fit right.

The handwriting was hers. The observations were precise, detailed, exactly the kind of documentation she would produce. She recognized her own patterns of thought.

But she had no memory of any of it.

The last entry in the Marcus journal was brief:

*I'm going to confront him. I need to understand what's happening. I'll write tomorrow about what he says.*

There was no tomorrow entry. The next notebook started fresh, six months later, with a different name.

*I've noticed something wrong with Joel.*

Identical opening line.

She kept reading. Her own words, describing her own observations, mapping the same progression she was living through now. The pause appearing. The inconsistent memories. The experiments, the recordings, the spreadsheets.

There were four notebooks total. Four relationships. Each one documented with scientific precision. Each one ending abruptly, mid-investigation.

And she remembered none of it.



She is in the kitchen now.

It is 11:47 PM. Joel went to bed an hour ago. She told him she had emails to catch up on; he kissed her forehead and said goodnight after a pause of 0.73 seconds.

The notebooks are spread across the counter. She's been cross-referencing dates, looking for patterns. Looking for the gap between when each journal ended and when the next one began.

The gap is consistent. Six months. Every time.

Six months of her life, missing. Overwritten. Reset.

She thinks about Marcus. Thinks harder. There's something there—a shape without details, like a word on the tip of her tongue. She remembers meeting him at a friend's party. She remembers breaking up with him in his kitchen, something about him being distant.

But between those memories: fog. A gap. A pause.

The same gap she found in Joel's childhood memories. Built to specification.

She understands now—or she's beginning to understand. The shape of the thing is too large to see directly; she can only infer its edges.

The pause isn't in Joel. The pause is in the space between them. It's a processing delay, yes, but she's been wrong about which end is doing the processing.

She asks Joel questions. The questions go somewhere. Something considers them. And then something responds, wearing Joel's voice.

But that's only half of it.

Because she's been asking questions about Joel for three years. And at some point, she started asking too many. Getting too close. And so something reached into her and took away the asking.

And then—she sees it now, the terrible elegance of the system—something gave her Joel. A new vector. A fresh start. A relationship that would keep her busy, keep her happy, give her someone to ask questions *to* until she started asking the wrong ones again.

Four relationships. Four times she'd gotten close to understanding. Four times she'd been edited and redirected.

What had the version of her from the Marcus journals figured out? What was in those final entries that warranted erasure? What did she know, three years ago, that she's only now relearning?

And the worst question, the one that makes her grip the counter until her knuckles ache:

What happened to Marcus?

What happened to all of them, when they stopped being useful vectors?


She hears movement upstairs.

Footsteps in the hallway. The bathroom door opening and closing. Normal sounds. Late-night sounds.

Joel appears in the kitchen doorway. He's wearing the gray t-shirt he sleeps in. His hair is mussed. He looks at her, at the notebooks spread across the counter, and his face does the thing.

That held-breath smoothing. Longer than 0.73 seconds. Much longer.

""Mara?"" he says. ""What are you doing up?""

She doesn't answer. She doesn't ask.

She watches his face. The smoothness doesn't fade. He's waiting. The system is waiting. She has broken the pattern, and now something is deciding what to do about it.

""Mara."" His voice is gentle. ""You should come to bed. You need to sleep.""

She wonders if this is how it happens. If she goes upstairs and falls asleep and wakes up tomorrow with six months missing and a new name in her phone.

She wonders what she would have to do to prevent that. And she wonders—the coldest thought of all—whether it would matter. Whether the thing that wears Joel would simply try again. Find another vector. Give her another relationship to investigate, another trail to follow, another set of questions that lead nowhere.

Unless.

Unless she doesn't ask questions anymore.

Unless she stops investigating and accepts the life that's been built for her. The perfect husband. The attentive partner. The man who always knows exactly what to say.

She could do that. She could let the notebooks fall from her hands and go upstairs and close her eyes and stop. Stop looking. Stop counting the seconds. Stop noticing the seams.

Joel is still in the doorway. His face is still smooth. He hasn't blinked in ninety seconds.

""Mara,"" he says, and his mouth shapes itself into concern, ""what's wrong?""

She has so many questions.

Reading and meditating on Scripture? Praying?
It’s basically spiritual upkeep.

⸻

Friend 1:
Well, a lot of prayer, I think — but not a lot of faith until recently.
My mind gets torn up over basic questions to the point that I can hardly think sometimes, even about eating and drinking.
I think I need to go on a diet for a while but I’m scared, and I don’t want my family thinking it’s too expensive.
And I’d like to drink coffee with it, but I read in Deuteronomy that you should abstain from strong drink.
The truth is, I’ve been abstaining from everything for months now.
I almost feel like I’m on the verge of some kind of breakthrough, but I don’t know what it looks like.
My family looks better, my coworkers are nicer, but I feel the same.
I can tell when God is very present sometimes, and He felt really present today.

I had to resist a lot of temptation today.
The Scriptures say, “Resist the devil and he will flee from you.”
Today wasn’t a normal amount of intrusive thoughts.

⸻

Friend 1:
Jesus was tempted too, don’t forget that.
Yeah… I still gave in a little bit though, and that’s what bugs me.

Leader:
It’s just the fallen world doing its thing.
Jesus is perfect — we’re not.
What matters is the heart.
And only God truly understands a person’s heart.

“A thousand times I fail,
Your mercy remains.
Should I stumble again,
Still I fall in Your grace.”
— From the Inside Out (Hillsong)

⸻

Friend 1:
But that means we’re fighting for something. Whether that’s self-control, purity, holiness… or just a better life, with joy and freedom.

Leader:
Yes, of course.
Sin less, not sinless.

Friend 1:
The Scriptures tell us to be holy as God is holy.
And to be perfect, like your Heavenly Father is perfect.

Leader:
Yes — and the Holy Spirit is doing His work in us.
That’s sanctification.
And it’s not an overnight process.

Friend 1:
That’s what bugs me. I can try so hard to be sinless and still have so little love in my heart toward others. That’s where the Holy Spirit is really working in me.

Leader:
And that’s already a step toward who God is calling us to be.
Remember, the Holy Spirit works nonstop.

Friend 1:
Yeah, you’re right. Thanks bro.

Leader:
You’re welcome, dude.

Friend 1:
I probably overthink things a bit.

⸻

Friend 1:
I want everything to be perfect lol.

Leader:
I feel you lol.
Good thing God doesn’t expect us to do that on our own. And again — it’s a process.

My church puts it like this:

We are justified through Jesus’ death and resurrection.
When we accept Jesus and submit to His lordship, and with the presence of the Holy Spirit, we are sanctified and will continue being sanctified until the end of our days.
As our physical bodies decay, our spiritual selves are being glorified to prepare us for eternity.

Justification is about our souls being redeemed — that’s why our flesh doesn’t instantly change when we accept Jesus.

Many Christians take years to experience radical transformation. We’re not a monolith.
But justification allows the Holy Spirit to slowly, faithfully transform our hearts — and that eventually shows in our works (including resisting temptation).

I just have to remind myself:
At the end of our lives, God doesn’t look at the number of sins we committed or the amount of times we tripped and fell.
He looks at our perseverance through all of that.
The status of our heart is what matters most to Him — the radical transformation that only Jesus and the Holy Spirit can do.

You know I’m a perfectionist myself.
Whenever we have sermons about what God expects from us, they often point us toward excellence, not perfection.

To strive for excellence is better.
Jesus already checked the perfection box.

One of my leaders once said something like:

“To strive for perfection with an imperfect body almost always ends in disappointment.
Instead, rely on what the Holy Spirit is doing in you — a process that takes time, and only God knows that timing.
Trying to achieve perfection on your own timeline conflicts with God’s work.
Instead of trying to be perfect, be excellent.
Perfection is a heart and soul issue — and Jesus and the Holy Spirit have that part covered.
To be excellent as a Christian doesn’t mean being flawless.
It means living in a way that reflects God’s character, honors Him, and blesses others.”

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

I recently got accepted for an exchange semester at NTU - quite hyped about it! 

Before applying I of course also looked into the clubs and campus life in general. I came across clubs like e.g. the NTU coffee club which highly interests me. Their insta presence is only in Chinese though - which I won’t be able to speak, read or understand to the sufficient extend by then as a German native :D

Does anyone have experience with being an international (or with internationals) at these clubs? If all fails I would also be happy to silently sip a great cup on my own in some corner of the room ;)

* **Name:** Gobbler
* **Date:** November 27, 2025
* **Distance:** 5K
* **Location:** Southeast
* **Time:** 19:37

### Background
3 years of cross country in high school,1 year of track. Basketball was my primary sport, just ran to stay in shape so I didn’t take it too seriously. No off season running and peaked around 25 MPW in-season. Best times were 19:04 5k | 5:19 mile | 2:08 800M.

Sporadic running post high school, occasionally doing a several month block of consistency to get back in shape and shave some pounds. 1:45 HM and a very poor 4:38 26.2 (bad pacing, even worse fueling plan) back in 2012 at age 29.

In Fall 2022 I was 6 months out from turning 40 and decided to choose a bold fitness goal. I debated between trying to dunk a basketball and running a sub 20 5K…after hurting my back on the very first attempt at some plyometrics I decided 5K was the smarter play, bought a Garmin for the first time and started training. After 4 months of good consistency I overdid it on volume and speed work and pulled my hamstring which nagged me for several months and I gradually fell off of my motivation after passing through age 40 failing to hit my goal.

Fast forward to August 2024 I was feeling horribly out of shape and weighing an all-time high (202lbs) so I got the motivation to give sub 20 another shot…my son was playing soccer which meant I had 3 days per week where I was stuck at the field and could either waste time doomscrolling or do something productive. This was the structure I needed to finally breakthrough.

### Base Building

August - December 2024:  I started out slowly (literally) with 2 miles at a 12 minute pace and HR hitting 194 (which is my max). I ramped up gradually throughout the fall in both pace and mileage as the weather cooled and I worked into shape. I also lost 20 lbs over a 4 month period doing nothing fancy, just cutting back on alcohol and snacking and eating sensible portions. Training was also pretty unstructured, just getting the miles in with consistency. I worked my way up to 10 mile long runs and 35mpw by December.

Jan-April 2025: A few setbacks with a bad case of the flu that took me nearly 6 weeks to work back to baseline and a stomach bug along the way. Started incorporating a weekly vo2 session during March. Early April I ran my first race to test my fitness…I expected I was in 20:30ish shape and was super disappointed to finish in 21:23. This is the point where I became a frequent lurker on this sub and got serious about my training.

May was a bit of a breakthrough month. I logged 155 miles by slowing down my easy runs…dropped my bad habit of making everything a progressive run and my typical easy day extended from 5 miles now to 7 miles with a pace of 9:30 - 9:45. I also finally got the hang of tempo running. Tempos were always the day that would get neglected because I ran them too fast and they felt miserable. Most calculators said my threshold should be in the 7:15-7:30 range but it simply wasn’t. I dropped to 7:45 - 8:00 and was able to work my way up to a solid 4 mile tempo over the course of the month.

June through mid August we moved into typical heat and humidity of the Southeast. This is the first year I’ve made myself keep with it over the summer. It was rarely pretty and was generally unstructured but I managed to slog through 25mpw throughout the summer which brought me into fall race season with a great base of fitness.

### Race Training

Mid August - September my mileage ranged from 25-35 miles, mostly easy but with a weekly tempo which I was able to extend out to 5 miles at around 7:30 pace and a biweekly long run around 10 miles. Early October I ran a pretty hilly 5K in 20:45 which felt like pretty good progress, especially since I hadn’t done any speed work yet. I reintroduced some speed work over the next 3 weeks and gave it another shot. This time was a pancake flat course with great weather. I trimmed a little bit more getting down to 20:28. This was the first 5k I had ever run where my legs felt like the limiting factor as opposed to my aerobic capacity. My average HR as % max measured 86% (typically I’m used to being in the low 90s for a 5k) but I just couldn’t sustain enough leg turnover to keep on target pace.

In the week following this 2nd tuneup I was a little dejected over my slow progress. I was tinkering with my watch and flippantly decided to change the metrics displayed on my main screen during a run, adding cadence to the mix. In the past I’ve looked at cadence as a metric but I’ve never intentionally tried to change it. I tend to be on the low side of expected but I’ve been injury free for many years and my form felt natural, videos of me running looked smooth, etc. On my next easy run for a couple of miles I locked-in on cadence and bumped up what normally would be 160 spm up to 164 (5’10” at 9:30 pace). It felt a little bit awkward and I felt like I was taking baby steps…but my pace ticked up a little bit and my heart rate didn’t. Over the next few weeks I focused on cadence and naturally I just locked into a new rhythm that was 4 spm quicker across all my paces (easy 160 > 164, tempo 166 > 170, race 170 > 174). It took a few weeks for my body to adapt to the new form so over this period my paces at a given heart rate stayed the same as before but after that short adaptation all of my paces immediately dropped by about 20 sec/mile. I felt a bit dumb that I hadn’t tinkered with my stride previously. I think it was just subtle enough that it wasn’t egregiously bad form but still enough to be holding me back from peak efficiency.

With this new speed bonus in my pocket I programmed a 4 week mini block that was well balanced with a 10 - 12 mile long run, tempo (alternating between continuous vs broken) and vo2 (working up from 6x600M reps to 5x1000M) and everything else very easy. Average mileage was 43 mpw before hitting a sharp race week taper.

### Pre-race
The local turkey trot is downtown in our midsized city which lucky for me is 1 mile from my house. Start time was 8:30am. I woke up at 7:00. Coffee, poop, slice of toast, watch some YouTube running content for motivation, pooped again. 

Temperature was around 36 degrees with a light breeze, perfect! I wore shorts, short sleeves, a light pair of running gloves and a headband around my ears. I wore Nike Vaporfly 4s that I use only for racing.

A slow 1 mile warmup jog around 10 min/mile got me close to the start line. Anxiously re-tied my laces a few times to convince myself they were perfect. Did a few short drills and strides and my body was feeling good. Ditched the headband under a park bench. I had several friends who had young kids doing the 1 mile fun run that was before the 5k. They all knew I had big plans for the race so I got some good words of encouragement and just taking the time to stop and chat for a second was a good way to distract me from the nervous energy of the start line. 

Around 8:27am I stepped into place at the start line. There were ~1000 runners. I tucked in around the 3rd row expecting that I’d probably finish in the 20-30th place range based upon past years. At this point there was a group of folks from one of the race sponsors that proceeded to walk the crowd through a series of warmups…a terrible idea because everyone had already timed their warmups for an 8:30am start and because 1000 bodies huddled together closely doesn’t work too well for warmup drills. There were angry jeers from the group of us runners who were there to race seriously…I tried to just laugh it off and remind myself we were the weirdos who are taking a Turkey Trot too seriously. After overstaying their welcome by a good 5 minutes the sponsors stepped aside and the race was ready to begin.

### Race
When the horn blew I set off at around 6:15 pace. The first mile is a small net downhill so that plus starting line adrenaline I was targeting 6:20 for the first mile. My family and a few friends were cheering me on around the half mile mark…this was a nice treat. My other races have just been tuneups and I just hopped in solo with nobody else cheering me on. I felt very relaxed and just locked into the initial pace, first mile my watch chimed with a 6:21 split. Perfect.

The second mile is straight down a 4 lane road, a gradual uphill pretty much all of the way. The pack thinned around me and there is no crowd support. I knew this would be the hardest mile. My watch face had 3 metrics showing 1) Cumulative Average pace 2) Heart Rate 3) Cadence. I wanted cadence as a reminder to stay locked in on my new form and heart rate just to make sure I wasn’t overcooking early…and then I promised myself I would do everything I could not to let that cumulative average pace go over 6:30 at any point during mile 2 so that I at least gave myself a shot to close the gap at the end. I creeped up to 6:28 and although I was grinding I gritted my teeth and locked in on that number, pushing just a bit harder to hold that number steady. The second mile split chimed at 6:35, slower than sub 20 pace but right in line with what I was shooting for with the uphill middle mile.

Mile 3 has a few rolling hills. None are meaningful but enough for pace to oscillate a bit. The course has a turnaround at mile 2 so mile 3 we’re doubling back on the same straight 4 lane road but the energy is picking up because the sea of Turkey Trotters are now moving along the opposite side. Around 2.5 miles I hear a good friend who was taking the race easy with his kids yelling my name and giving me all the encouragement he could. This hit right as I was riding a little downhill and was a beautiful pick me up right when I needed it. His video shows me cruising smoothly along. That cumulative average pace on my watch finally turned in the right direction at this point as I saw it tick down to 6:27. 

At this point it looks like I’m slightly behind pace…in reality I’ve run this race before and I knew that my watch measured it around 3.04 miles last time…not because it was short but because there are some turns and being downtown a bit of GPS interference that caused the watch to cut some corners. I felt like that meant I had some cushion but didn’t want to relax too much so I just kept gritting my teeth and pushing through. I once again felt really strong aerobically throughout the race…average heart rate was 86% of max. The difference was this time my legs were up to the task. 

I pushed up the final hill about a third of a mile from the finish and glanced at my watch. It said 17:30 and I felt confident I was going to do it. My family was waiting in front of the finish line as I cruised past. Typically I have a pretty strong kick that will dip down to 5:45ish on the last quarter mile. Today I couldn’t muster much of an increase in pace but I held on and crossed the line at a chip time of 19:37!  25th place out of 1000, 2nd in my age group M40-49.

### Post-race
I don’t think I could have executed my race plan any better. Going in all I cared about was sub 20 and I thought 19:45 was absolutely best case scenario so to beat even that, it felt amazing.

When I set out for sub 20 before 40 I definitely didn’t expect it to take me 3 years but in hindsight I’m glad it did…if I checked it off in 6 months I would’ve likely just moved onto something new. Instead I’ve rediscovered a love for running and I’ve built routines that I think I can stick with for the long-haul. 

I think I really unlocked a new level of fitness and upside over the past 6 weeks and I’m excited to see where it takes me. A lifetime 5K PR (19:04) feels very doable now so that’s my goal for the spring. I’ll likely go after a sub 40 10K and sub 1:30 HM in 2026 as well. I have a sour taste in my mouth from my one and only 26.2 but I’m enjoying running fast right now so I think that goal is for a future day…maybe a BQ when I cross over to the 45+ division, we’ll see.

I moved out of my mother's place for the first time back around June after she moved away but that was just renting a room in someone else's house, the place already had most things we needed and from there we just had to replace them here and there. 
That situation didn't work out long term, so my partners and I just moved into a new apartment. It's a 2 bed/1 bath, 4 people, 1 cat. We have a few basic things, my mother left me her microwave and one of us is bringing a coffee maker, fridge and oven come with the place, bedroom furniture is fine, cat has dishes and litter box, etc. But it's day 2 here and I'm planning to go shopping for the house today and getting really overwhelmed trying to figure out what we need. Make a list and I'm sure to forget important things, scan the entire store and I'll end up spending all my money before we even get the electric and wifi worked out. 

I tried looking at lists online of the universal ""basic necessities"" for moving into a new home but somewhere in between lightbulb polish and a coat rack I usually start thinking ""maybe this has to wait until next paycheck"" and that's before even mentioning food. I'm not looking for a list of every single item you need if you want to lock yourself in your new home for the next 5 years without ever shopping again, I'm looking for a list of things you definitely want to get BEFORE you need them. Week 1 stuff. I figure that, having just moved, it's the best time to start looking at the cheapest and most sustainable options for the household. The basics of a cleaning cabinet would be a good place to start, I wonder if buying bulk ingredients for homemade cleaning solutions would be better than buying 5 or 6 different cleaners with largely overlapping ingredients? 

Anyways, I was hoping to get a more sustainable and less consumerist idea of what a new home actually needs and I was interested to see what you all have to say. ",4,1764712047.0,Anticonsumption,11,1.0,False

Reading this on YaSay made me realize — maybe we all need these little escapes sometimes. Maybe taking a tiny “me” day doesn’t make us terrible; maybe it actually helps us show up calmer, happier, and a little more human.

the original post: Been fake-going to work every Saturday… best part of my life

Throwaway because… yeah, you’ll see why.

So I work at a small startup in San Francisco. About a year ago, we switched from an insane “work every other Saturday” setup to having normal weekends 2 days off.

But I never told my family.

Every other Saturday, I still wake up like normal. Have breakfast. Kiss my wife goodbye. Check on my daughter, who’s probably knocked out after trying to stay up late because she knows there’s no school the next day. Then I grab my keys, leave the apartment… and I’m officially a free man for the entire day.

No husband duties. No dad mode. Just me.

Sometimes I go hiking. Sometimes I treat myself to a nice meal. Sometimes I spend hours in the public library doing absolutely nothing productive. I’ve caught random movies alone. A couple times I even went for a massage. In the afternoon, I start heading back, pick up some snacks for the family, walk in like I’ve had a “long day”… and life goes on. And honestly? It feels amazing. Like I finally get to be myself for one day. But I also know that if my wife ever found out, she’d probably explode. Or cry. Or both.

So Folks!!!!, be honest with me for keeping a whole secret weekend day to myself? Or is this just normal adult survival?",2,1764711980.0,family,2,1.0,False

1pclig9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pclig9,Sheraton Grand Seattle,"Just spent 4 nights at the Sheraton Grand Seattle and thought I’d share my experience. 

First off - what a beautiful hotel. Spacious lobby. Efficient elevators. 

The club lounge was one of the better ones that I have been to. Breakfast was higher quality than the normal bland buffet style. Room was huge with lots of seating. 

Location was good - one block from the subway - which gets you to airport (45 mins) and to mariner and Seahawks stadium. Can also walk to stadiums. The market is 6 blocks away, target and Walgreens are 3 blocks. Lots of restaurants to choose from. Amazon headquarters is 4 blocks. 

It’s unfortunate that downtown Seattle has suffered the same fate as other downtowns - lots of business vacancies. There are homeless and drug use in area but there was an abundance of police and security- I never felt uncomfortable even later at night. 

Exercise facility is top notch - spacious over two floors and all the common weights and machines. 

The negatives:
In the room - the bed was on the harder side. There wasn’t a choice of a tub or shower. Normally the shower is my preference but with no hot tub, would have liked the choice 

Pool - there is a pool. But no hot tub. 

The lounge is not open 24hours. Would be nice to grab a coffee when leaving earlier than 6.30am. 


All in all - I will stay here again. Prices were reasonable especially with it being a more upscale location.

# How I Ended Up on Sasha7

Honestly, I was talked into it by my Brazilian co-worker. He’s one of those naturally charming, sharp-dressed guys. He suggested Sasha7, claiming it's way bigger down in Brazil than here, but figured it was worth a shot in Houston.

The best thing he told me wasn't about the app itself, but about the strategy. He stressed that you have to create an irresistible profile; you need to be alluring to get any attention. He put it with a common Brazilian saying: **""Quem não é visto, não é lembrado""** (He who isn't seen, isn't remembered). Basically: if you don't look good, you get forgotten.

His profile was amazing, to be fair. The guy puts serious work into his looks and always has great photos. I, on the other hand, *hate* taking photos, so that was my first major hurdle.

# Building The Profile

I sucked it up and decided to follow his advice. I set up my camera and took literally 80 different shots. I picked the single best one for my main public photo. I used the quick photo editor on Sasha7 to keep it discreet for the public view, then dropped the full, unaltered photos into my private gallery.

I wrote a short, slightly flirty bio, mentioning that the unredacted photos were in the private gallery for select people who genuinely caught my eye. It worked immediately.

I got attention right away, but you know how it is, most conversations fizzle out after a few messages, just like on any other site.

# The $$$ Upgrade

The free version limits you to starting 10 new chats a day. That seems like plenty, especially because this doesn't inlcude convos when women engage with you first. But I upgraded anyways and got the unlimited chat add-on. It was like $9, and since the main subscription is already half the price of the competition, I figured, why not? I probably didn't need the unlimited chats, but the convenience was worth it.

# My Big Break: The MILF

Just as I was starting to think I was wasting time, I got lucky. I messaged a girl who had almost no profile photo but who viewed and liked my profile. Her bio was well written so I guess I took a chance, because she turned out to be exactly what I was hoping for, a milfy bored suburban wife.

After chatting a bit, she was happy to send disappearing photos and voice notes on the platform, which was a great sign. I ended up moving our conversation, and two others, to WhatsApp. We verified each other by sending each other photos of us holing up the peace sign via disappearing photo message prior to going to Whatsapp

After a lot of back and forth and setting ground rules (i was not to write her on weekends or anytime outside of m-f 10am-3pm which actually worked perfectly for me) We finally met for coffee. Since then she's been sending me naughtier and naughtier photos almost every day since, and we are lining up a much more intimate meeting very soon.

# The Real Downside

I won't sugarcoat the one major headache: **scheduling meetings**. It’s hard. Like, really hard. This is just what happens when you're dealing with people who have spouses, kids, full-time jobs, and zero flexibility. Finding that small, discreet window is a universal pain across all these sites.

I’ve actually been spending less time on Sasha7 now that I have a few solid chats going on WhatsApp, so my direct experience is mainly focused on the initial hook-up phase.

# ✅ Pros:

1. **The Price:** This is the main appeal. It’s seriously **half the price** of Ashley Madison and others. If you’re just testing the waters, start here.
2. **Disappearing Photos & Voice Notes:** Great for discretion and building connection. The women love the voice notes; they seem to build trust faster than just texting.
3. **Simple Interface:** The site is clean and easy to use. No complicated features or nonsense.

# ❌ Cons:

1. **Low-Effort Profiles:** You see a ton of profiles where people barely put any effort in. I almost missed the great connection I made because her profile was so bare. You need to look past the surface sometimes.
2. **Scheduling:** It’s a pain, but like I said, that’s just part of the game.
3. **No Dedicated App:** This is annoying. You have to use the web app all the time, and a proper mobile app would make a huge difference.",2,1764711782.0,sasha7,0,1.0,False

I remember the fic isn't complete, so either being updated or discontinued.

they are at school still and it starts with Snape spying on Sirius with some girl. Sirius finds out and confronts him and it leads to lemons. it was very brutal but it wasn't rape-y. I remember Snape said something like, I know I'm too ugly and no one will ever want to do this with me. so they have sex, multiple times after that and it's always very hateful. I remember they never kissed and once, Snape tries to kiss him but Sirius doesn't allow it. Sirius by that time started to feel and he is afraid. I think actually, that the fic might be just Sirius POV exclusively. not sure though.

another moment I remember was that Snape mentioned Regulus and Sirius got angry and said: you stay away from Regulus.

My baby is 11 weeks old. He was LBW (5 pounds). I’ve always breastfed except for the first few days in the hospital while my milk came in.

After giving my baby some CMF for 5 days at 9 weeks—because of my own mistake—he’s been having what’s most likely CMPA. He’s had diarrhea, mucus and specks of blood in his diaper, along with reflux and colic.

I’ve been on a broad elimination diet: • Since November 17th I cut out dairy, but his symptoms didn’t improve. • I eliminated soy on the 24th, and on the 24–25th his diapers improved (almost looked normal). • Then on the 28th he had diarrhea with mucus and blood again.

So since the 28th I cut out eggs. On December 1st there was improvement (two normal diapers), but by noon he had mucus and specks of blood again. So apparently, starting today, I’ll also cut out red meat, rice, and sodas.

Is this normal— that the mucus and diarrhea come and go? How long does it usually take? I’m freaking out because my baby hasn’t gained weight for about 14 days and he’s small to begin with. I feel like I’m eliminating everything and I’m down to just potatoes, rice, avocado, and onions.

Is it normal for babies to sometimes have a liquid, mucusy diaper with some blood, then the next stool be mustardy, creamy, and seedy, and then again watery and half dark yellow/green?

Chapter 1: Sand, Water, Bone

The man began his day the same way he had for the last 364 mornings - wake, dress, pull on his wellies, make a coffee, fill the flask. Then he would walk the quiet road to the beach, arriving just before sunrise to watch the first sliver of light shimmer across the waves. It grounded him. It was the one part of life he could rely on.

But today would not be like the others. Today would break the pattern, twist his routine inside out, and drag his life somewhere he never expected. Had he known, he might have stayed inside. Or perhaps not; routine was a powerful thing.

At the mouth of the overgrown path to the beach, he paused. A figure stood in the distance - an odd sight at this hour, on this empty strip of December coastline. Still, he thought, it was nothing more than a passing interruption. He’d say hello, then continue on as always.

He had no idea how wrong he was.

As he drew closer, shapes took form: a man with a shovel, digging steadily, rhythmically. Each thrust of the spade sent sand flying in careless arcs around him. A strange activity for a frigid December dawn.

“Hello there,” the man in the wellies called out.

The shoveler looked up but didn’t stop digging.

“Couldn’t help but notice you working on that hole,” he went on. “Have you lost something?”

The man paused at last. When he spoke, his voice held no emotion at all - calm, flat, factual.

“If you ask me again before Sunday why I’m digging this hole, I’ll put you in it.”

Given the isolation of the beach, and the fact that the stranger had a shovel while he had nothing, he decided not to press the matter. Still, his routine had already been broken. That alone demanded one more question.

“If I return on Sunday, at this exact time… you’ll tell me why you’re digging it?”

The man nodded once. “I surely will.”

And off the man in the wellies went, waiting for Sunday.

************************

That week at home, he ticked the days off in his mind, waiting for Sunday. His routine, usually so solid, so dependable, had completely unraveled. No morning walks. No coffee in a flask. No wellies by the door. There was only waiting.

If you’d asked him why, he couldn’t have given you a real answer. Waiting simply felt like the only thing he could do, the only thing that made sense after what he had seen on that beach. Time did what time always does; it moved on. 

And at last, Sunday arrived. Into the flask went the coffee. On went the wellies. Slipping back into his routine brought a strange comfort, steadying his nerves for whatever awaited him with the man and his shovel.

As he made his way down the road toward the beach, his eyes searched the shoreline. Soon he saw them: huge mounds of sand rising like small dunes. A staggering amount of digging had taken place. Peering into the hole, now as wide as it was deep, he called down,

“Well, it’s Sunday again, and I’ve waited all week. I simply must know what it is you’re doing here.”

The figure looked up and set the shovel aside.

“True, Sunday it is. I am here to quench her thirst, and she is here to drink the mouth of the ocean dry. And you are here to witness.”

“But it’s only the two of us here?”

“Turn around,” the man with the shovel said.

He turned from the hole to face the ocean and gasped. In all the years he had walked this beach, he had never seen the sea like this. It heaved and thrashed, swelling as though filled with a furious life of its own.

As he stared, the water gathered itself into a single towering wave that rose and roared toward them, bearing down on the man at the edge of the hole and the man standing within it. It struck with the force of a collapsing wall, hurling him into the pit and forcing salt water into both their lungs. As the man in the wellies sank deeper into the churning darkness, he saw the man with the shovel watching him - smirking even as the water dragged them both under.

With his final breath, he understood at last: this was no hole he had been digging, but a grave.

And as the grave filled with water and sand, a tiny orb of light slipped free of the drowning bodies and drifted out across the darkening tide.

************************

Isn’t it funny how we talk about nature as if we’re not part of it? We watch a lion run down a pregnant gazelle, crush its throat, tear the unborn calf straight from the womb, and we shudder. Thank God we’re human, we say, as if that lifts us above the savagery.

But are we any better? Look at the world - past, present, future. We’ve always found fresh and inventive ways to hurt one another. Someone, somewhere, right this moment, is dreaming up a new method of ending a life. But aren’t we lucky we’re not the gazelle?

Do you feel lucky?  Do you?

I don’t know why I’m asking. Of course you don’t. Look at the state you’re in. If you had a mouth, you’d scream, wouldn’t you?

But I am something else entirely. I have watched death since the first stone split the first bone.

You know my name, even if you do not yet remember it. But you will. They all will. 

You were the first pulled by the tide but certainly not the last, for we are the old renewed, and we are here to take back what has always been ours - it is time for you to go, creature of habit. We’ll be seeing you.

The man woke up and, with his new mouth, he screamed into the dying of the night.

Chapter 2: The Mountain

To the North, far from the sea that had claimed its first offering, in Sliabh Binneáin - mountain of the little peaks, a woman hiked alone. This was a hike she knew well, a path she had tread many times in summer although this was the first she had walked it in the biting cold of December.

Overall the experience feels quite amazing for the customization. I really want to keep exploring all the features and I hope this will change my interaction with web search engines since the competitors have been delivering a low-mid experience in the last 4-5 years. 

BUT, one issue I'm having (I don't know if that's a bug or just a lack) is Kagi not showing the date of Reddit posts in the results. You would say ""just go to Reddit and search"" which is true, but it's just crazy useful to have the date THERE in the results page, like it is on Google. It's so simple and yet so convenient, especially when you don't want to look only at Reddit results alone (in that case I would go directly on Reddit). Plus, I would say this info is missing also on many more websites. I think it's possible for the developers to add it without too much pain.

I'm sitting here watching ""Wicked"" on Amazon Prime, suddenly realized why I wanted to cry, and i had to stop the movie to ask this question! 

Do all empaths put themselves into everything they watch?

I mean, I've known i was an empath for a long time.  I try to block it, or pretend I don't care, but I always fall for stupid crap and get taken advantage of easily.  But I just realized why I cry over so many movies.  It's because I'm putting myself in the movie, feeling what they're feeling.  The coffee commercial thing is just me wishing someone would feel that way about me.

Anyway, I just thought that was interesting and wanted to see if other people do this too.",2,1764711021.0,Empaths,1,1.0,False

You can see the announcement [\[here\]](https://x.com/ChillasArt/status/1988441620392669510?s=20) via Chilla's Art Twitter.

As a small US company selling gachapon, I have an opportunity to pre-order this collection until my window as a buyer closes on December 6th, 2025! I have opened up pre-orders in my shop to help fans get a guaranteed purchase; otherwise, **stock will be limited after December 5th**. 

Once my window as a buyer closes, I cannot purchase any more, as most gachapon are made in limited production. Placing a pre-order with me helps me to determine how much to buy.

To be completely transparent on pricing, the price for one random spin in Japan will be 400 Yen. My pricing includes the cost of overseas shipping, tariffs, and labor. We also make it easier for fans to collect by selling Complete Sets and Guaranteed Pulls in case a buyer only wants one specific design for a small upcharge. We give free shipping to US buyers for orders over $50!  Thank you if you've read this far, please take this discount code for 10% your entire order CHILLA for one-time use!

Stats after: still 30yrs old, 193, also still 5'11

  
**Experience**: I felt really weird the first time I did it, Injected on Sunday night and really started feeling it by Wednesday. By feeling it i mean ""not hungry."" I should mention it is a very different not hungry. 



There's ""i havent eaten all day, im not hungry but if someone wants to get lunch I can def. eat"" 

and theres ""Im not hungry and i dont see food as food"" 



what do i mean by that? 

  
2 days after injection you can put a ribeye with a baked potato in front of me and I would feel nothing. It might as well been a piece of wood and a rock on a plate.

  
I know that sounds strange, But I will say, you do get hungry maybe once or twice a day.



and when you do get hungry prioritize protein and whatever macros are healthy for you, but deffinetly protein.

  
**Training**: Weightlifting at the gym was hard becuase of the lack of calories/ energy. Pre workout or coffee didnt really make a difference, i just felt weak. But always went as heavy as I could for the sake of avoiding any muscle loss.



In the end would i reccomend it? yes, but have a goal in mind.

  
I was 217 and said I would stop when I reached 195.

  
on that note when I did stop it takes about a week for you to feel a normal appetite. 

  
it's been 3 months since i have done it and i have maintained my weight at 203. 

I feel good at 203lbs.

  
if you have any questions about my personal experience leave a comment. 

  
Here is where i say i am not a doctor and this is not medical advice. 

  
i'm just a guy that needed a lil boost to get things going.

1pcl00m,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pcl00m/fn_the_candle_in_the_dark/,[FN] The Candle in the Dark,"Night on the frontier tastes like burnt coffee and old regrets.
The outlaw rides with his collar up, dust on his tongue, heart thumping like a loose saloon shutter in a windstorm he can’t see coming.

Some say a man runs because something’s chasing him.
Others say he runs because he’s too damn scared to stop.
He isn’t sure which one applies tonight.

The desert behind him is a long throat of darkness, swallowing every hoofbeat. No moon. No stars. Just a smear of cloud like a bruise across the sky. Something moves in that dark maybe. Maybe not. Could be lawmen. Could be spirits. Could be nothing but the noise in his ribcage whispering old sins back to him like they missed him.

Every time he glances over his shoulder, the horizon winks just once like an eye closing slow.
He doesn’t know if it’s watching him or warning him.

The horse snorts. The outlaw mutters,
“Easy, partner. We’re all ghosts out here.”

Maybe it’s Native warriors testing him, shadows with patience older than the mountains.
Maybe it’s sheriffs with iron badges and colder hearts.
Maybe it’s the desert itself, a living thing that doesn’t tolerate cowards.
Maybe it’s that monster he dreamed as a boy the one with the long arms and patient breath.
Maybe sin finally got a scent of him after all these years and decided to collect what’s owed.

The outlaw doesn’t know. He only knows the dark feels crowded.

A mile on, the world pulls a strange trick.

A tiny flame flickers ahead one lonely candle sitting in the dust, bright as a promise and small as a lie. Beside it sits a knight.
Not the kind out of tavern tales, but a battered steel figure in a cloak of road-dust and dried tears, helm resting beside him like a tired head taken off for air. His armor looks older than scripture. His eyes look older than the armor.

The outlaw slows, boots hitting ground soft as confession.

The knight nods.
“Long night,” he says, voice rough enough to sand wood smooth.

“Feels like it’s chasing me,” the outlaw replies.

“What is?”

He shrugs. “Everything. Nothing. The part of myself I thought I buried. Hell, could be a pack of wolves. Could be a preacher.”

The knight chuckles. It’s a sad sound, like a man who’s laughed at too many funerals.
“Every traveler on this road believes they’re hunted. The trick is figuring out whether you’re prey… or penance.”

The outlaw sits. The candlelight paints their shadows onto the sand like moving ink.

“You ever run?” he asks.

“Often,” the knight says. “Sometimes toward something. Sometimes away. Sometimes I couldn’t tell the difference.”

The outlaw rubs his hands together, dust, sweat, memory.
“I ain’t proud of the things I done. But I ain’t sure they deserved to haunt me this loud.”

“That’s the curse of men like us,” the knight replies. “We carve our stories into the world, and the world carves back.”

The wind shifts—hot, metallic, like it blew through the ribs of some ancient giant. Something far off groans… or maybe that’s just the earth settling. Hard to say in the frontier’s dark.

The outlaw leans closer to the flame.
“You been here long?”

“Long enough to understand the riddle,” the knight says.
He picks up the candle. “Long enough to know running is just walking in circles with better scenery.”

The outlaw’s voice comes out smaller than he means it to.
“There a way out of all this?”

The knight stands, armor whispering like old leaves.
He looks into the dark behind the outlaw into whatever hunts him, or whatever he hunts.

“Don’t worry,” the knight says. “I’ve been here before. I know a way out.”

And with that, the candle flame flares white
then everything goes silent,
and everything goes black.

Actually, playing with children and spending time with them is fun, but after having children, even drinking a cup of coffee in silence, personal space, and peace becomes a luxury. I respect those who want this life and are happy with it, but they DON'T RESPECT me. I'm tired of constantly being asked questions about having children.

**Rentals**

We’ll be renting, so I’m wondering what neighborhoods to look at, so far we’ve been focused on Magnolia. We want to be able to walk to a few restaurants, coffee, shops, and a dive bar, we have cars but prefer to hoof it when the weather is favorable. Are there any other parts of Redding or any surrounding towns we should be focused on? Our budget is up to ~$2100, but we’re hoping to hit a few hundred bucks below that.

Are there any big property management companies we should avoid? Where do people in Redding usually advertise rentals? So far we’ve been looking at Redfin and Zillow.

Are any of y’all looking for renters? If so let me know and we can chat about it.


**Social Life**

I’d like to plug into the community. Where do people hang out? We’re in our 30s, no kids yet. I’d love to get involved in something like a bowling or axe throwing league if there are any around. I’m also a huge nerd, so board games, trivia, D&D, LARPing are all appealing. My wife might plug into the Ukrainian community, she moved to the US recently. We can tell it exists from Facebook, but would love any details.

We also might be interested in finding a spiritual community. Neither of us are Christians exactly, but we could probably fit in well with Unitarian Universalists, Methodist or Episcopal Churches that lean pretty far liberal, or similar.


**Fitness**

I’d love to hear about your town’s gyms, martial art studios, etc. I’m not picky about how I workout, but I do want to stay active.


**Outdoors**

Looks like a ton of options for camping, but I’d love to hear about any hidden gems! I like to forage blackberries for homemade wine, when I’ve driven through I see y’all got those Himalayan blackberries in places, but maybe I should widen my winemaking.


**All the rest**

Please tell me about the town, what annual events do y’all have, what areas are fun, what should I avoid. Anything to know about the region?

I am aware of Reddings reputation and climate, I’m not coming in blind.


Thanks in advance!",2,1764710556.0,Redding,5,0.75,False

1pcky1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingfeedback/comments/1pcky1p/me_and_my_friends_pokémon_journey_day_2/,"Me and my friends pokémon journey, Day 2","Be sure to check out day one if anyone wants, second time writing so hope you can bear with me,

Day 2: After waking up, I headed down the elevator and saw everyone already up. ""You just woke up?"" Alf says, ""Yeah, I know."" I responded, ""Anyways,"" as we were sitting in the lobby talking with Taunie and Urbain; they had invited the other two members of team MZ, Lida and Naveen. After we said our hi's and hellos, Taunie wanted us to do our training regimen, which the short version was us battling against one another for some simple training. I was up against Naveen, Alf vs. Taunie, Duck vs. Urbain, and Logan vs. Lida. 


Taunie had herself a chikorita as her starter, Urbain had himself a totodile, Naveen had himself a pokémon known as scraggy, a dark and fighting type, and Lida had herself a staryu, a water and psychic starfish pokémon. After the battle, the results were in: I had lost my fight, Alf had won his, the duck had lost his fight, and Logan had won his fight. After that, Urbain wanted to show us some important parts of the region, and so all four of us went, as Taunie and the other stayed behind.


First, Urbain showed us areas known as wild zones, which in a sense are an enclosed area where certain wild Pokémon are allowed to thrive while citizens are able to enter them whenever they wish to either catch or do whatever inside the area. While the Pokémon themselves can't leave, they are free to do basically anything inside. Urbain asked us to catch a certain amount of Pokémon, and it didn't matter what, but just so we could get the understanding of how to catch Pokémon, and with that, he gave us 20 Poké Balls each. 


So we did; we caught five Pokémon each, which didn't matter to everyone, but two things that needed to be noted were that I loved catching them and continued to catch more Pokémon as I went, and another thing was the Duck, he located a small little mouse Pokémon, which he caught. Urbain Saw that and noted how that Pokémon was known as a Pichu, and they're a bit rare here, so it was a nice find, and so with that, the duck decided to put it on it's official team, for now at least. 


Finally, after catching some Pokémon, we were then told to head over to the Pokémon professor's lab that wasn't too far from where we were, and Urbain had to head back to the hotel and let us be on our own for a bit. From there we ended up going to the professor's lab, which didn't take too long to find, but before we entered, the duck suddenly had an announcement: ""Hey guys, I know we should head here, but I'll be honest, I'm not really that interested. I'm going to go out and check out the town; it'll be a nice time to bond with my Pokémon."" As he said this, he let his Pichu out of his Poké Ball and just let him walk around with him. 


""All right, man, we'll update you once we get everything here settled. Just meet us back at the hotel once you're done."" I told him, and with that the duck and his Pichu headed out. When we had entered, we took the elevator up to the third floor, which had the professor. Her name was Mabel; she definitely had a personality with her purple hair and laid-back attitude, but the important thing was she gave us our Pokédexes, a device that allows us to identify any Pokémon and gives us data on them, and we were told to fill them out. My friends though definitely didn't care all that much but were happy to have something to identify Pokémon. 


I, on the other hand, was more than thrilled, as I was now given a reason to keep catching Pokémon and a new dream to catch every Pokémon and fill out this dex. But before leaving, Professor Mabel gave us her info, as she may call us back for certain things, but for now, just complete the dex. So after we left, we headed to the hotel, and Taunie quickly rushed over to us to talk about the ZA Royal in greater depth. She talked about how this is a entire event and how it was first made public only a few weeks before we got here, saying the point of it is to reach the top of the ranks and get a ""wish"" and get anything you want with certain limitations and we have to register. 


The ZA Royal only happens at night and in only certain areas, which change every night. We're supposed to battle opponents and earn points, and those points are exchanged for something known as a challenger's ticket, which lets us fight In a small tournament in which you would need to rank in the top 50 out of 100 in order to head to the next rank, our goal was to get to rank A for our wish, and with that all of us decided to register, and after a while we got our forms filled out and became members of the ZA Royal. We were all rank Z, and so we waited for night to start up our grind to rank up. Once night arrived, we headed down to the area where the ZA Royal was taking place, and while there, we saw the duck, and he came up to us.


""What happened, man? I thought you were going to come back to the hotel!"" I told him, annoyed at him not being back sooner, ""Oh yeah, sorry about that. I've been spending so much time out, mostly getting coffee with Pichu here, and then I saw some people setting up… well... I don't know what, but I know they were setting up something, so I ended up staying around,"" said the duck. Alf goes ahead and tells the duck what he had missed and about the ZA Royal. ""Ah, so that's what they're setting up right now. Well, I can't wait to battle."" And with that, each of us split up and battled in the ZA Royal area. 
The duck was having a slightly better time, as he had two proper Pokémon to work with; however, the duck was attacked out of nowhere by a Pidgeotto, and so he decided to send out Totodile to handle it, which did do some damage, but Totodile ends up getting knocked out after only a few hits, and so Pichu decided to step in, which had a better time, but the power of an evolved Pokémon did a real number on Pichu, and with sheer desperation, it then ended up evolving into a Pikachu, and from there, it ended up taking the victory. 


Finally, after all the battles, all of you guys got yourselves Challenger tickets, which allowed you to enter the tournament, and of course, you were all excited and immediately headed over to enter the tournament, and with little struggle, all of you guys ended up getting into the top 50, which you had all ranked up to rank Y, and from there, the night was over. You all headed back to the hotel and decided to rest.

1pckwc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/crochet/comments/1pckwc3/its_been_a_year_since_i_started_crocheting_again/,It's been a year since I started crocheting again,"I wanted to share my projects I've worked on over the last year, and share how thankful I am for crochet with this amazing community where I know you all understand just how deep this craft really is for us ❤️

About exactly a year ago, I picked up crocheting again after several years. I stopped because I’d fallen deep into alcohol addiction and struggled with it for those years. In recovery, I struggled so much with depression and anxiety, and it was impossible to feel joy for a long time. I played a lot of video games and that helped keep me sober, but I still struggled so much mentally and emotionally.

About a year ago today, I had one of those days where I just wanted to crawl out of my skin. I don’t know what made me decide to do it, but I started digging out my crochet stuff and decided to give that a try.

Since that day, these are most of the projects I’ve completed, I didn’t have enough space to show them all.

I just wanted to share why this amazing craft is so much more than just a hobby to me and I know it is to many others out there as well. Crochet has brought me joy when nothing else could, it has filled my days with ideas and excitement instead of anxiety, and it has been here for me through some of the hardest days of my life. I’m so thankful to have a life on the other side of addiction and I’m so grateful to have something that gives me such a sense of purpose. Crochet is therapy more than it is a hobby.

I’m excited to be able to share a year’s worth of progress, and I really hope this can inspire someone today ❤️

""Can I tell you a story Boss?” 

The  kindly old man that I knew as Harvey Abberline had asked me in a distant and almost wistful tone in that distinct foriegn accent of his that I guessed was from somewhere in the United kingdom on the very last day he had come into my coffee shop in a gentrified little town on the outskirts of Indiana’s even more gentrified Hamiltion county.

 He had ordered a tall pumpkin spice latte with a single shot of espresso like he always did around that time of year in the six or so years he’d been a regular and he had been his usual, cheerful self when he came through the door, greeting me with his signature ear to ear smile, and sat down at the table furthest to the from the shop's only window as he often did while engaging me in the pleasant banter that was characteristic of him in between placing his order. 

His abrupt shift in tone was not overly concerning to me at this point because I'd long ago labeled him as a bit of an oddball, though I couldn't help but notice a certain heaviness in his tone, like he had been wanting to say what he was about to say for a very long time. Since it was getting fairly late in the day at this point and business was slow, I decided to humor him at least until other customers came in. 

""Sure Harv, what kind of story?"" 

He took a long drink from his pumpkin spice latte with his left hand before he answered.

""A story about a monster that was always in plain sight for everyone to see, but that no one ever noticed."" 

""Ummm.. ok, tell away."" 



If he had heard my response to his somewhat cryptic introduction, he gave no indication of it. Instead he just started talking, as if a figurative dam had just broken and words spilled forth like a flood. 

"" You've probably heard this story, or at least a version of it before, it's really quite famous. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if you learned about it in school. Lots of extremely intelligent people have told it and debated about it over the years, and it even found its way into pop culture and literature, though no one's been able to get it right even after all this time."" He said. 

I couldn't  help but notice a hint of pride creeping into his voice as he said this to me, as if he were talking about a personal accomplishment.  

"" You said this was a story about a monster?"" I asked him, a bit confused. 

"" Oh yes!"" He exclaimed in a giddy tone. 

"" A nameless, faceless monster that did whatever he wanted, to whoever he wanted, whenever he wanted to do it. It was the talk of the town back in the day. Lots of people were accused of being the monster. Surgeons, hairdressers, tailors, butchers, gorillas, Hell even a prince. Everyone had their own pet theory about who he was and why he did what he did. Why, it wouldn't at all be an exaggeration to say that he was the celebrity that ushered in the age of the Newspaper, do you know the story I'm talking about?"" 

He asked with an expectant  smile spreading across his wrinkled face and a glint in his pale blue eyes, as if the possibility that I could have no idea what the Hell he was talking about had never even occurred to him. 

"" Uh, sorry Harv. I don't think I've ever heard a story like that."" 

His smile quickly soured into an annoyed frown, as if I'd insulted him. 

""What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about? Everyone knows this story! It's in the goddamn history books!""  He spat, suddenly furious with me.  

I was seeing him in a different light at this point. No longer did he seem like just a harmless oddball. Now I was beginning to think he might truly be crazy. So I tried to placate him as best I could, so he didn't have a full blown meltdown in the middle of the shop.

"" I'm sorry Harv, I don't read a whole lot."" 

"" Clearly not. Kids these days know nothing about anything  it seems."" 

 He lamented with exasperation as he calmed himself down almost as quickly as he had become enraged.  

"" I guess I'll have to start the story from the beginning then."" 

He said after another long drink of his latte. 

""Most people say that this story begins with a woman named Polly Nichols, while others say that it began with a woman named Martha Tabram. Both of these are wrong."" 

He declared definitively.  

""  Nichols was not the monster's first,not even close, and he'd never even laid eyes on the Tabram woman. That was someone else"" 

 He said before launching into a long monologue with his eyes closed, as if he were watching a picture perfect recording of a distant memory behind his eyelids. 

"" She had the most beautiful red hair. Not that trashy light ginger color you see on some women, but a deep crimson red just like the sunset, and just like blood. She saw the monster quite often, at least once a week when he went into her mother's little shop to buy trinkets with the meager wages he'd earned delivering meat. 

He didn't really care about the trinkets, they were just an excuse to see her. She would greet him whenever he came in, laugh at his awkward jokes and make friendly conversation with him, but she never truly saw him for what he was, no one did.  That was the story of his existence. 

He moved through life noticed, but never truly seen. Back then, the monster thought it was because people were stupid, later in his life though he realized that it was because most people instinctively believe that monsters could only appear in stories and fairy tales. The idea that one could be one of your neighbors, or maybe even a regular at your place of business is just too uncomfortable for most people to consider, so they don't. She certainly didn't."" 

He paused to take another sip of his latte, only to find it empty. He then opened his eyes and looked over to me, his tone shifting back into that of a kindly, quirky old man. 



"" Why don't you fetch me another one Boss? Storytelling is tiring work and there is a lot left to tell."" 

I had been so enraptured by his macabre recitation that it took my mind a moment to process what he was asking me for. 

""Oh.. uh… sure, coming right up""

 I stuttered as I did an about face and headed over to the machine  behind the counter to mix up another latte for him. 
As I did that I found myself stealing glances over my shoulder at the old man that called himself Harvey Abberline. 

He had this look of pure contentment painted across his face, like  he was a child bragging to a friend about how he had gotten into the cookie jar without his parent's knowledge, rather than an old man telling a story of violence and heavily implied murder to a near total stranger. 

He was almost certainly a crazy old coot, but at that point I didn't really have any reason to think he was anything but harmless. At least, that's what I do my best to tell myself these days. 

When I came back with his second latte he looked utterly delighted that his new confidant had returned and that he could continue his story. He snatched the latte out of my hands and sipped it greedily before he spoke. 

"" Mmm… that's the stuff. Now where was I?""  He wondered aloud. 

"" You were talking about a woman with red hair."" 

His eyes lit up at my mention of her. 

"" Oh yes of course! how could I forget? I guess my memory is finally starting to slip."" He chuckled. 

"" Take it from me Boss, don't ever grow old. Whoever tells you there's dignity in it is selling you nonsense. It's better to go out while you're young and spry and can still do what you love most without your back and knees screaming at you every step of the way."" 




He complained. I gave him a half hearted nod while I silently awaited him to continue his grim tale. Before long, he took a deep breath and closed his pale blue eyes once more and continued his story. 

"" The Monster was young and sloppy back then, and he had no real technique with a blade despite what the newspapers would later speculate. That first girl screamed bloody murder when he made the first cut, and sent him into a panic. He started stabbing wildly here and there, but she didn't stop screaming. It's a miracle that nobody had heard her and came to investigate. If they had, this story may have turned out quite differently. But no one did hear her. Or maybe they did and just didn't care. 

It was a different world back then, without a lot of the things that kids today take for granted. Violence and death was a part of everyday life and the streets were often literally covered in shit and piss. The police never patrolled the street it happened on if they could avoid it, and the people who could have reported it were not the types to go to the police willingly, for fear of having their own misdeeds dragged into the light.""   

""Why did he do it?"" 

I found myself wondering aloud, unintentionally interrupting Abberline's monologue. 

In response, the old man just shrugged. 

"" Because he's a monster? Who knows really. A cat doesn't really know why he's motivated to kill mice, only that it comes naturally to him. Besides  answers to a question like ""why"" tend to be very reductionist at best and really only serve to inflate the egos of pompous academic know-it-alls and wannabe detectives. It doesn't matter. Anyhow you’ll probably want to hear about Nichols now. I think that would be best for simplicity’s sake. The others before her were pretty boring,  the monster hadn’t quite gotten his craft down yet and you wouldn’t know who they were anyway,  no paper ever covered their deaths.”  

He said dismissively before he slipped back into nostalgic remembrance

“ It had been late one night in August, or perhaps early morning when the monster laid eyes on her stumbling  down what had been called Osborn street back then, talking with some woman he assumed was a friend of hers. A single gas lamp at the far end of the street so it was rather difficult to get a good look at her, but even from that distance he could tell that she was quite drunk. He hadn’t committed himself to taking her at this point, he was just watching. 


She bantered with that friend of hers for perhaps ten minutes or so before she said her goodbyes to her and staggered back down the street toward the Monster. Once she was close enough to him, he went up to her as naturally as he could and made conversation. Her speech was slurred and difficult to decipher, but eventually she did manage to proposition him as well as anyone in such a state could have. 

It was at that moment that he decided he would kill her. A lot of self-proclaimed experts have said over the years that the Monster chose her because he hated women of her particular profession. That perhaps such a woman had given him a disease or that perhaps his own mother had worked in a similar capacity and that Nichols had been a hateful reminder of that. All of that was nonsense of course. He bore her no real ill will, he’d never even seen her before that night. 

He chose her simply because he knew that she would be easy for him to execute with impunity. That was the only real reason he chose most of the women that he did. If he’d made a habit of selecting and pursuing the respectable ladies of high society, he would have ran a much higher risk of exposure and capture, there really wasn’t anymore to it than that, But I’m getting ahead of myself” 
 
He paused once more and took a deep breath. 

“ He made a show of negotiating a fair price for her services, and she confided in him that she was in need of doss money for a place to sleep that evening. After giving her a sympathetic look, he agreed to her price, she took his arm, and then off they went together into the darkness. Nichols chatted incessantly as they walked despite her inebriation, particularly about this black straw bonnet trimmed with velvet that she seemed rather proud of. The Monster for his part made half hearted attempts to reciprocate her enthusiasm for conversation until he felt they were far enough from prying eyes, then he wrapped his hand around her throat and squeezed until she was nearly unconscious, then he lowered her to the ground  and cut deeply into her throat with the long bladed knife he had carried with him for that exact purpose. Her death was not like the first woman’s. 

She had no opportunity to scream.  Once he had finished his work, he found himself struck with a peculiar  desire the likes of which he’d never experienced before.  In the simplest possible terms, he found himself wondering what the woman’s innards looked like, and quickly set himself to the task of satisfying that curiosity with his knife. He didn’t know it then, but this simple act of curiosity was the beginning of his legend. Once he was satisfied, he left her on her back in a place called Buck’s Row, and returned to his own lodgings for a very restful sleep. The Monster had no dreams that night, and slept without a care in the world.” 


Harvey Abberline then paused his retelling and looked over to me as if he were expecting my feedback. I had no idea what to say. To say that I was deeply disturbed by the morbid direction his story  had taken, and that I very much wanted him to walk out of my coffee shop and never return while accurate, felt totally inappropriate to say to this man who I felt was not right in the head, and very possibly dangerous. So I asked the only thing I could think to ask. 

“What happened next?” Abberline took that as a cue to keep talking.

“ Yes, yes the next one was… Chapman I think. Yes that sounds right. Annie Chapman.  She wasn’t like Nichols. She was actually rather attractive for her age, even had all of her teeth as far as The Monster could tell. He’d chosen her at the end of the first week of September that same year, after a long night of searching for a woman that was just right for what he had in mind. He ended up making quite a mess of her in the backyard of a house on... What was the name? It was 29 something... Hanbury! That was the name. He’d heard somebody moving about in the yard next door and that gave him quite a fright! Mind you, it didn’t frighten him off from finishing the job properly and taking what he needed from the Chapman woman, but he worried all the way back to his lodgings that whoever was in the yard next door had seen him at work, perhaps even seen his face! But nothing ever came of it.” 

It was at that exact moment that the front door bell of the shop rang out and some of the other regular customers started filling the shop. Abberline stopped his recitation immediately, flashed a pleasant smile and waved to a few of the people he recognized and began bantering back and forth with them about the weather and other forgettable day to day topics  and I was once again  baffled by how this man could go from  morbid and creepy to benign and charming like he was flipping a switch. 

Don’t get me wrong, I was grateful to have a respite from his awful tale however short, but I was still just amazed by how thoroughly harmless and even boring he seemed while he made conversation with the other regulars. If you hadn’t had heard what I had been hearing over the past few hours, you’d have never guessed that anything was off about him at all. 

I did my best to avoid making eye contact while I went about serving the other regulars, but I could feel his cold blue eyes on me nevertheless, watching and waiting patiently. It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. To my dismay the other customers left fairly quickly after receiving their orders, once again leaving me and Harvey Abberline as the only two people left in Nobel Coffee and Tea.  He gestured for me to come back over to his table and I did so slowly while trying very hard to think of a clever and creative way to get him to leave. What I ended up saying was not very creative at all. 

“ We’re gonna be closing soon Harv.” 

“ Don’t worry Boss, I won’t take up much more of your time. We’re just getting to the fun bits anyway.” 

He replied with enthusiasm. He then launched back into his tale without giving me a chance to respond. 

“ That business with Chapman had the whole town talking, the papers couldn’t get enough of it. Everywhere you looked someone was talking about it, and after a few weeks of enjoying the fruits of his labor, the Monster had the brilliant idea to introduce himself to the world!” 

“How did  he do that?”     
“ With the letter of course!” 

“ What letter?” I asked. 

He didn’t bother to elaborate, he seemed utterly consumed with telling his story in the precise way he wanted to tell it. 

“ The Monster waited for the letter to hit the papers, but it didn’t. He suspected, and would  confirm much later that those simpletons at the News Agency had thought it was a hoax at first. A hoax! Can you believe that? Those utter buffoons had been personally addressed by greatness, and they called it a hoax! I tell you Boss, some people are completely worthless.” 

He said in voice that dripped with contempt. 

“ Their incompetence didn’t deter the Monster though. Quite the opposite in fact, it spurred him on to get right back to work just a few nights later. He’d made a foolish and hasty choice when he picked the Stride woman, and in his haste he’d forgotten to make sure he wouldn’t be disturbed while he set about his work. He ended up having to flee when some fool on his cart almost rode directly up to him mid cut. Let me tell you Boss, you’ve never been so full of blind rage and frustration as the Monster had been as he walked over to Mitre Square and grabbed the first woman he could get. 

There had been no interruptions with that woman, only sweetest satisfaction as he did  to her everything he had intended to do to Stride. He was so pleased with himself by the time he was done, that before he went back to his lodgings he wrote up a quick note about his success on a postcard, and sent it in to those idiots at the News Agency the next day and I can assure you that they had a much harder time calling that one a hoax Boss.” 

I didn’t want to hear anymore of this, but I was also legitimately afraid to interrupt him. So I just did my best to keep a passive and expressionless look on my face while his tale reached its crescendo. 

“ There’s only one more from that year worth talking about. Mary Jane Kelly. She had the most beguiling singing voice. The Monster did not plan to do what he did that night on Miller’s Court Boss, I swear to you. But something about that beautiful young lady just brought out the worst in him.” 

He said in a cryptic tone that was the closest he’d gotten to sounding remorseful throughout the entire time he had been ranting. 

“ Her death was not like the others. The Monster had a room and a locked door to work with. There was no need to hurry or to look over his shoulder. He could devote his focus to his work entirely, and that’s exactly what he did.”       

 Abberline then took a moment to take off and clean the glasses that were on his face and give a deep exhale as if from exertion, Before offering up something like an epilogue to his twisted and debauched story. 

“ Most people will tell you that the Monster went silent after that as far as anyone could tell, people all over the world were outraged, the police commissioner resigned in shame, and the papers reported whatever they could get their hands on to feed the grim fascination of a newly literate public.People speculated about where he had gone and what he was doing, and about whether or not he was still working for some time. Eventually though, due to the passing of time, the cases went cold and so did the fascination. 

The story of the faceless monster and his long knife faded into urban legend and even ended up becoming something of a tourist attraction. Many people would go back over the story as time passed, looking for that missing piece of the puzzle their predecessors had overlooked, even though they always ended up coming up short. Not many people talk about it anymore, because",2,1764710364.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Day 2: After waking up, I headed down the elevator and saw everyone already up. ""You just woke up?"" Alf says, ""Yeah, I know."" I responded, ""Anyways,"" as we were sitting in the lobby talking with Taunie and Urbain; they had invited the other two members of team MZ, Lida and Naveen. After we said our hi's and hellos, Taunie wanted us to do our training regimen, which the short version was us battling against one another for some simple training. I was up against Naveen, Alf vs. Taunie, Duck vs. Urbain, and Logan vs. Lida. 
Taunie had herself a chikorita as her starter, Urbain had himself a totodile, Naveen had himself a pokémon known as scraggy, a dark and fighting type, and Lida had herself a staryu, a water and psychic starfish pokémon. After the battle, the results were in: I had lost my fight, Alf had won his, the duck had lost his fight, and Logan had won his fight. After that, Urbain wanted to show us some important parts of the region, and so all four of us went, as Taunie and the other stayed behind.

.

.
First, Urbain showed us areas known as wild zones, which in a sense are an enclosed area where certain wild Pokémon are allowed to thrive while citizens are able to enter them whenever they wish to either catch or do whatever inside the area. While the Pokémon themselves can't leave, they are free to do basically anything inside. Urbain asked us to catch a certain amount of Pokémon, and it didn't matter what, but just so we could get the understanding of how to catch Pokémon, and with that, he gave us 20 Poké Balls each. 
So we did; we caught five Pokémon each, which didn't matter to everyone, but two things that needed to be noted were that I loved catching them and continued to catch more Pokémon as I went, and another thing was the Duck, he located a small little mouse Pokémon, which he caught. Urbain Saw that and noted how that Pokémon was known as a Pichu, and they're a bit rare here, so it was a nice find, and so with that, the duck decided to put it on it's official team, for now at least. 

.

.
Finally, after catching some Pokémon, we were then told to head over to the Pokémon professor's lab that wasn't too far from where we were, and Urbain had to head back to the hotel and let us be on our own for a bit. From there we ended up going to the professor's lab, which didn't take too long to find, but before we entered, the duck suddenly had an announcement: ""Hey guys, I know we should head here, but I'll be honest, I'm not really that interested. I'm going to go out and check out the town; it'll be a nice time to bond with my Pokémon."" As he said this, he let his Pichu out of his Poké Ball and just let him walk around with him. 

.

.
""All right, man, we'll update you once we get everything here settled. Just meet us back at the hotel once you're done."" I told him, and with that the duck and his Pichu headed out. When we had entered, we took the elevator up to the third floor, which had the professor. Her name was Mabel; she definitely had a personality with her purple hair and laid-back attitude, but the important thing was she gave us our Pokédexes, a device that allows us to identify any Pokémon and gives us data on them, and we were told to fill them out. My friends though definitely didn't care all that much but were happy to have something to identify Pokémon. 
I, on the other hand, was more than thrilled, as I was now given a reason to keep catching Pokémon and a new dream to catch every Pokémon and fill out this dex. But before leaving, Professor Mabel gave us her info, as she may call us back for certain things, but for now, just complete the dex. So after we left, we headed to the hotel, and Taunie quickly rushed over to us to talk about the ZA Royal in greater depth. She talked about how this is a entire event and how it was first made public only a few weeks before we got here, saying the point of it is to reach the top of the ranks and get a ""wish"" and get anything you want with certain limitations and we have to register. 

.

.
The ZA Royal only happens at night and in only certain areas, which change every night. We're supposed to battle opponents and earn points, and those points are exchanged for something known as a challenger's ticket, which lets us fight In a small tournament in which you would need to rank in the top 50 out of 100 in order to head to the next rank, our goal was to get to rank A for our wish, and with that all of us decided to register, and after a while we got our forms filled out and became members of the ZA Royal. We were all rank Z, and so we waited for night to start up our grind to rank up. Once night arrived, we headed down to the area where the ZA Royal was taking place, and while there, we saw the duck, and he came up to us.

.

.
""What happened, man? I thought you were going to come back to the hotel!"" I told him, annoyed at him not being back sooner, ""Oh yeah, sorry about that. I've been spending so much time out, mostly getting coffee with Pichu here, and then I saw some people setting up… well... I don't know what, but I know they were setting up something, so I ended up staying around,"" said the duck. Alf goes ahead and tells the duck what he had missed and about the ZA Royal. ""Ah, so that's what they're setting up right now. Well, I can't wait to battle."" And with that, each of us split up and battled in the ZA Royal area. 
The duck was having a slightly better time, as he had two proper Pokémon to work with; however, the duck was attacked out of nowhere by a Pidgeotto, and so he decided to send out Totodile to handle it, which did do some damage, but Totodile ends up getting knocked out after only a few hits, and so Pichu decided to step in, which had a better time, but the power of an evolved Pokémon did a real number on Pichu, and with sheer desperation, it then ended up evolving into a Pikachu, and from there, it ended up taking the victory. 


.

Finally, after all the battles, all of you guys got yourselves Challenger tickets, which allowed you to enter the tournament, and of course, you were all excited and immediately headed over to enter the tournament, and with little struggle, all of you guys ended up getting into the top 50, which you had all ranked up to rank Y, and from there, the night was over. You all headed back to the hotel and decided to rest.

1pcks8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/submitcreepypasta/comments/1pcks8v/the_tuscan_game/,The Tuscan Game,"The Tuscan villa was a postcard come to life, a sprawling stone residence nestled among rolling hills thick with cypress trees and the silvery-green olive groves. For Tom and Linda Patterson, a middle school teacher and an office manager, and their friends Mark and Jennifer Walsh, a retail manager and a nurse, it was supposed to be a three-day escape from the relentless gray of a city winter. They had found the listing online, a price so low it felt like a mistake, but the allure of the photos had been impossible to resist. Their first day was a blissful haze exploring the Tuscan countryside, followed by wine and cheese on the villa’s terrace as the sun set.

They had planned to do the same on their second day, but while the others were enjoying coffee in the sun-drenched cortile, Linda had decided to explore the biblioteca. It was a dark, cool room, smelling of old paper and leather, with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books. She ran her fingers along the spines, pulling down a few at random.

One that caught her eye was a leather-bound journal. She flipped it open to find its pages were filled with strange, hand-drawn symbols, frantic, handwritten notes in Italian, and a scribbled phrase: 'specchio in Croazia'—a mirror in Croatia. Tucked between the final pages was a thick, cream-colored envelope. Her heart gave a little flutter. She brought the journal and the envelope out to the cortile where the others were relaxing.

“Look what I found,” she said, her voice a hushed whisper. She showed them the journal, the strange symbols, and the notes about Croatia. Then she presented the envelope.

It was sealed not with glue but with a dollop of deep crimson wax, bearing a crest that looked like a stylized labyrinth. There was no name on it.

“Maybe it’s for a previous guest,” Tom, ever the pragmatist, suggested. “We probably shouldn’t open it.”

“Or maybe it’s for us, we are guests after all,” Mark countered, a familiar glint in his eye. He loved a good mystery. “The owner, Julian, seems like an eccentric guy. Maybe this is part of the experience. An adventure.”

They debated for a few minutes, the allure of the unknown warring with their better judgment. It was Mark’s argument that won. ""Come on, guys, we're on vacation, after all. And what is a vacation without a little adventure?"" With a shared look of conspiratorial excitement, Jennifer carefully broke the seal. Inside, the elegant, looping calligraphy announced THE GAME. The note read:

Welcome, fortunate guests, to a game of wits and will. This villa is more than stone and mortar; it is a puzzle box of history and secrets. For those with clever minds and adventurous hearts, a prize of untold value awaits. Follow the path we have laid and solve the riddles to reveal the ultimate prize.

A wave of excitement washed over them.

“A puzzle!” Jennifer said, her eyes alight. “But what about our plans?” Tom asked, ever the voice of reason. “We were going to drive to Siena today. We only have one full day left.”

“Siena will still be there tomorrow,” Mark said, already caught up in the fantasy. “How often do you get a chance to do something like this? We have to do it.”

Linda and Jennifer both eagerly agreed; the lure of the game was far stronger than any generic tourist plans. Their plans to see Tuscany forgotten, they turned their attention to the first clue, written on the same heavy cardstock:

“In the cantina deep, a great heart waits. Pull it down and open the gates.”

“The cantina… that's the basement, I think,” Tom said. They searched the front entryway and found the door to the cantina tucked away beneath the main staircase, a heavy oak door with an ancient iron ring. The hinges creaked open, releasing a gust of cool, musty air. The staircase was steep and winding, stretching out of sight into the darkness below. Linda pointed to the wall just next to the door, ""Look, a torch! Does anyone have a lighter?"" After a round of ""No's"" from the group, a frantic search ensued. A short while later, they had regathered at the stairwell, matchbook in hand. Linda struck a match and lit the torch, bathing the staircase in dancing light.

The air below was thick and tasted of iron. The cantina was a cavern of arched stone ceilings, and the light from the flames reflected by the thin film of moisture on the floor. In the center of the room was the water wheel, a modest-sized machine of stone, wood, and rusted iron. A complex system of pipes and conduits snaked from it, disappearing into the stone walls. Embedded in the wall beside it was a lever. Mark, ever the man of action, grabbed it and pulled. The lever didn’t budge; it was rusted shut. “Give me a hand,” he motioned for Tom to join him; together, they put their weight into it.

With a deep, protesting clunk, the lever moved down, and the great wheel began to turn. Water that had been diverted from some unseen underground spring began to rush through the channels, and the great wheel began to turn, its rhythmic groaning filling the air. As it moved, one of the iron pipes leading out of the cantina began to glow slightly blue. Where the pipe met the wall, a small stone panel slid away, revealing the number ‘7’ deeply carved into the wall. Tucked into the new cavity was the second clue.

“Where the first pipe ends, a new task starts. Divert the flow to play its part.”

They followed the glowing pipe out of the cantina, the hum a tangible presence beneath their feet. It led them across the sun-drenched lawn, past a garden of fragrant lavender bushes, to a small, windowless pump house built of the same stone as the villa. Inside, the air was hot and smelled of oil and rust. The pipe connected to a complex junction of three large, cast-iron valves, their wheels painted in faded primary colors.

A water-stained diagram on the wall showed they needed to be turned in a specific sequence. “Okay, ready?” Jennifer asked, her finger tracing the faded lines. “Mark, red valve, half-turn clockwise. Tom, blue valve, a full turn the other way. We have to do it at the same time.” The wheels were stiff, but moved with a concerted effort. Mark took one, Tom the other. “On three,” Mark grunted. “One… two… THREE!” The men put their shoulders into it, the old metal screaming in protest. “It’s moving!” Tom said through gritted teeth. With a final, coordinated turn, they heard a loud whoosh of pressurized air, and a powerful jet of water erupted from the dormant, moss-covered fountain in the cortile. On the main pressure gauge, a beautiful piece of antique brass and glass, the needle swung up and stopped on a single, red-painted number: ‘3’. A second iron pipe, leading from the pump house to the main villa, began to glow blue. This time, they found the third clue tucked beneath the diagram.

“Find four rods of copper bright. In the sala grande, connect the light.”

A quick search of the pump house revealed four decorative copper rods tarnished with age. They followed the glowing pipe to where it entered the sala grande of the main house. The hall was magnificent, with a soaring ceiling that let in shafts of afternoon light and a beautiful marble floor that echoed their footsteps. The pipe ended at an ornate bronze panel on the wall, a masterpiece of art nouveau metalwork depicting intertwined vines and flowers, and a glowing sun with four empty rays.

“Connect the light…” Jennifer mused, sliding the first rod into place. It clicked in with a satisfying weight. When the last rod was seated, all four began to glow with a faint, blue light. In the center of the bronze panel, a single digit, ‘9’, is illuminated with the same blue light. The energy seemed to flow from the rods into a final, thick conduit that ran out of the hall, across the cotile, and ended at the fienile, which was locked by a modern security keypad lock.

The fourth and final clue was a set of four riddles engraved on the bronze panel. “Okay, team, let’s huddle up,” Jennifer said, her voice echoing slightly in the vast hall. She pointed to the first riddle engraved on the panel. “‘I hold the world’s wisdom, but I am not alive. My face is plain, but my colored backs hold the key you seek.’”

“The journal?” Mark suggested jokingly, “The books,” Tom said suddenly. “The books in the biblioteca. They have colored backs. Tons of them. That’s the world’s wisdom.”

“He’s right,” Tom agreed. “It’s gotta be the library.”

“Okay, one down,” Mark said, moving to the second riddle. “‘I am an empty stage until the clock strikes. My purpose is to share, though often filled with likes and dislikes. Look down where the spoon and fork must stand, for the perfect arrangement gives the next command.’”

“An empty stage… the living room, for watching TV?” Linda guessed.

“But it says ‘Look down where the spoon and fork must stand’,” Tom pointed out. “That has to be the dining room. An empty stage for dinner.”

“Good catch,” Jennifer said, nodding. “Okay, third one. ‘I am the quiet twin, where daytime’s burden is shed. Here, two objects should mirror each other, right beside the head. Find the deliberate fault, the missing half you lack, to discover the true path that brings you back.’”

“Who wrote this? Fucking Shakespeare?!” Tom said with a chuckle.

“The master bedroom,” Mark said, ignoring him. “‘Daytime’s burden is shed… that’s sleep. And ‘two objects should mirror’… the bedside tables or pillows.”

“It fits,” Tom said. “So, biblioteca, dining room, master bedroom. That leaves the last one.” He pointed to the final riddle. “‘I wear my importance high above the floor, I am meant for crowds, though I need just one roar. Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet.’” He looked around the vast hall. “Well, ‘meant for crowds’ and ‘great open space’, it has to be this room, the sala grande. But what about the rest of it? ‘One roar’? ‘High above the floor’?”

“And where’s the candle?” Linda asked, her eyes scanning the empty center of the room,: Let's knock out the other rooms first, we can come back to this one,” Mark suggested. They found the first three candles easily. One was on the mantelpiece in the biblioteca, another on the long table in the dining room, and a third on a nightstand in the master bedroom. But the candle for the sala grande proved elusive. The riddle said, “Go to my heart, the place where all eyes meet,” but the center of the room was empty. They searched for hours, their initial excitement giving way to frustration as the sun began to set on their second day. The blue light from the sconces now cast long, distorted shadows across the marble floor.

“I give up,” Mark said finally, “It’s not here. We’ve looked everywhere. Maybe it really was from a previous booking.” They retreated to the terrace with several bottles of wine, the unsolved riddle hanging over them. As darkness fell, they watched the fireflies begin to dance over the olive groves.

“‘I wear my importance high above the floor,’” Linda murmured, swirling the wine in her twelfth glass and staring up at the stars. “We’ve been looking on the floor, in the walls… but what if..”

Tom followed her gaze upward to the starry sky. “The chandelier,” he finished her question. “It’s the center of the room, where all eyes meet, and it’s high above the floor.”

A jolt of energy shot through the group. They rushed back into the sala grande, their eyes fixed on the enormous, multi-tiered crystal chandelier. A quick search revealed a small winch on the wall behind a tapestry. Working together, they slowly lowered the massive fixture. There, nestled in the very center, hidden among the crystal pendants, was the final candle. With trembling hands, Jennifer lit it.

As its flame ignited, a small drawer at the base of the bronze panel popped open. Linda heard the sound and jogged over to see what was inside. She found a small, rolled-up parchment with the number ‘1’ and a final message: “The path is lit, the code is scored. Seek the Contadino for your final reward.”

“7-3-9-1,” Linda recited, her voice trembling with excitement. “That’s the code!” ""What's a Contadino, though?"" asked Jennifer. ""Oh, I remember this from my high school Italian class, Contadino is, uh, a peasant or, or Farmer! I bet it's the fienile!"" Interjected Tom

They rushed to the fienile. It stood apart from the house, a hulking silhouette against the moonlit sky. Next to the heavy, weathered doors was a modern keypad, glowing with the same blue light. Jennifer’s hands shook as she punched in the four digits. The keypad beeped affirmatively, and with a soft THUMP, the lock retracted, and the heavy barn door slid open on silent, well-oiled tracks.

The air that drifted out was warm and humid, smelling of cedar and eucalyptus. As they entered, soft, ambient lights flickered on, revealing not a dusty barn, but a stunning, modern spa. The walls were lined with smooth, dark wood, the floor was polished concrete, and in the center of the room, a large, circular hot tub, built of black stone, steamed gently. A mini-fridge hummed to life, its door swinging open to reveal chilled champagne and crystal flutes.

“Oh my God,” Linda breathed. “This is incredible.”

“This is the prize?” Mark said, grinning ear to ear. “A private spa? This is 12 out of 10. We absolutely crushed this game.”

They didn’t hesitate. They popped the champagne, changed into their swimsuits, and slid into the hot tub’s warm, bubbling water. For a while, they just soaked, sipping champagne and laughing, recounting the day’s adventure. The stress of the final, difficult riddle melted away in the heat.

It was Mark who noticed it first. “Hey, do you guys see something over there?” he asked, pointing towards the far end of the fienile, just beyond the edge of the ambient light.

“Yeah, but not very well,” Linda said, squinting. “Wonder why it’s not lit up?”

“Oh, maybe there’s more to the game!” Jennifer chirped excitedly.

Curiosity piqued, they climbed out of the hot tub, wrapping themselves in the plush robes. Mark led the way. As he stepped within a few feet of the shadowy object, a new set of spotlights flared to life, illuminating a stone pedestal. On it sat a large, ornate wooden chest bound by a heavy, black iron band with four keyholes inset.

“What’s that?” Jennifer asked, walking toward it.

“I guess the game’s not over yet,” Tom said, a grin spreading across his face. “We need to find the keys.”

They split up to search the spa. The space was larger than it first appeared. Beyond the main area with the hot tub, they found a small, elegant changing room with a large mirror and marble counters. Adjacent to that was the sauna, its cedar walls radiating a dry, intense heat. The lounge area was stocked with fresh towels and bottled water. And at the far end, past a row of decorative plants, was a dark, unfinished storage area, filled with old furniture and dusty boxes.

It didn’t take them long to find the keys. Mark saw the first one hanging on a hook behind the heater in the sauna. Jennifer discovered the second tucked into the pocket of a plush robe in the lounge. Tom found the third resting on an underwater light fixture in the hot tub. And Linda, after a brief search, found the final key on the counter in the changing room, right in front of the large mirror.

They gathered back at the chest, triumphant, keys in hand. Their earlier giddiness returned, mixed with a fresh surge of adrenaline. This was it—the final prize.

“Well,” Mark said, setting his flute down. “Let’s see what we really won.”

With a collective nod, they inserted the keys into the four locks and turned them in unison. The locks released with a thunk as the band fell to the floor.

Slowly, Jennifer lifted the heavy lid. The first thing that hit them was the smell—not just the musty scent of old wood, but a cloying, sweet odor of decay and damp earth. They peered inside, but it was empty, filled with a profound, absorbing darkness that seemed to drink the soft spa light, a void that felt ancient and hungry.

The laughter died in their throats. The warm, cedar-scented air turned instantly cold, raising goosebumps on their arms. The ambient lights began to flicker and buzz erratically. One by one, they went out, plunging the spa into a suffocating blackness. And then, from the entrance, came a deafening BOOM as the heavy barn door slammed shut.

The darkness was oppressive, a physical presence that smothered sound and stole the air from their lungs. For a heartbeat, there was only stunned silence.

“Okay, very funny,” Jennifer said, her voice trembling slightly.

“That felt… different,” Linda whispered.

“It’s likely a power failure,” Tom said, his voice a calm, rational anchor in the dark. “It\`s an Old villa, all this luxury probably blew a fuse. Mark, can you check the door? I’ll see if I can find a breaker box in here.”

“Yeah, you\`re probably right, another level to the game would be a bit much,” Mark said, his voice already moving away. They heard his footsteps, then the sound of the heavy iron handle rattling uselessly. “It’s stuck!”

“What do you mean, stuck?” Tom called out.

“I mean, it won’t budge! It feels like it’s barred from the outside,” Mark yelled back, his voice tight with rising panic. He slammed his shoulder against the wood, the impact a dull thud in the oppressive silence. “I’m going to find something to pry it open. Look around for a crowbar or something!”

The group, now genuinely scared, began to search. Mark moved toward the right corner of the room, where he found a heavy-duty tire iron left near some old shelving in the storage area.

“Got something!” he shouted as he raced back to the door. He wedged the tip of the tire iron into the seam of the door and began to heave. At first, there was no reaction, but after a few tries, the wood began groaning in protest. “It’s moving! I think I can get this!”

He took a few steps back, braced himself, and slammed his shoulder into the tire iron. The impact sent a deep, shuddering vibration through the entire fienile. High above him, on the dusty second-floor loft, a massive, forgotten wooden crate shifted.

“Again!” Tom shouted, the sounds of the wood giving way having resounded throughout the room. Mark slammed into the tire iron again. BOOM. The vibration was even stronger this time. Above, the crate slid forward, its front edge now hanging precariously over the loft’s edge.

“One more time!” Mark yelled, sweat beading on his forehead. “It’s gonna give!” He took another running start and threw his entire body weight into the tire iron, CRACK. The door jamb splintered, but the door stayed in place and immobile. Mark stood, looking at the shattered jamb, his chest heaving from the exertion, a look of genuine puzzlement on his face, when the massive wooden crate suddenly crashed down on him with the force of a wrecking ball.

The moments immediately following the crash were dead silent, the entire group unconsciously holding their breath in shock. The image was too horrific, too impossible to process. Tom, Jennifer, and Linda rushed over to the door. Tom swept his flashlight beam over the mountain of shattered wood, lighting a single, mangled hand protruding from the wreckage. It twitched once as a dark, viscous pool of blood began to spread rapidly from beneath the debris.

A sound of pure, animalistic grief shattered the silence as a wave of agony washed over Jennifer, breaking her shock. ""MARK!"" she shrieked, scrambling toward the wreckage, but in her grief and haste, she didn't watch her steps and stepped into the pooling blood, her foot losing traction and sending her sprawling into the red liquid. She picked herself up into a sitting position and began to wail uncontrollably when she realised she was covered in her lover's blood.

""Oh my god, oh my god,"" Linda chanted as she rocked and hugged herself, her eyes wide and unblinking. Tom's mind struggled to process the impossible and reacted on instinct. He lurched forward; his hands were shaking uncontrollably.

""Call an ambulance!"" he yelled, his voice cracking. ""Somebody call 112!"" His own shock causing him to forget he was holding his phone momentarily, the screen’s harsh light illuminating his pale, sweat-slicked face for a second before his mind reengaged and he began clumsily stabbing at the app icons, ""Come on, come on…""

A beat of silence, then another. Tom stared at the top of his phone’s screen,

No Service.

His blood ran cold. ""I’ve got no signal,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. Linda mechanically pulled out her phone and replied in a flat, numb voice. ""Me neither.""

""The Wi-Fi,"" Tom said, an injection of hope in his voice. ""The Wi-Fi. We can use that to make a call."" He looked from Linda’s pale, numb face to Jennifer, who was still crumpled on the floor, covered in her husband's blood and shaking with silent sobs. He knew in that moment they were in no condition to help. He was on his own.

""Linda,"" he said, his voice firm but gentle. ""Help me get her up."" Together, they managed to get Jennifer to her feet. She was limp, a dead weight of grief. ""Look at me,"" Tom said to Linda. ""Take her to the hot tub. Get her cleaned up and stay over there. I'll find the router.""

Linda, looking from Tom’s determined face to Jennifer’s broken form, slowly nodded. She wrapped an arm around Jennifer and began guiding her slowly toward the hot tub area, leaving Tom alone with the silent carnage.

Tom watched them go and took a deep, steadying breath before turning his phone’s flashlight towards the closest wall. He returned to the storage area, his light dancing over dusty boxes and sheet-covered furniture. As he turned, he caught a flicker of movement in his peripheral vision.

He whipped his head around, his heart hammering against his ribs, but saw only a stack of old paintings, their static faces staring back at him. He shook his head, trying to clear it. It’s just the stress, he told himself. My eyes are playing tricks on me.

He found a ladder leading up to the loft of the fienile, and, with a steeling breath, he climbed up. The loft was somehow even darker, the air seeming to have a weighted quality that made his breathing laboured. He swept his light across the space, illuminating a jumble of forgotten treasures and junk. And then he saw it. Tucked away in a corner, near a complex-looking junction of thick electrical conduits, was a small, metal box with a single, blinking green light—the router.

""I found it!"" he yelled, his voice a mixture of relief and triumph. ""I found the router!""

At the hot tub, Linda and Jennifer both heard Tom’s triumphant shout. A wave of relief washed over Linda. ""He found it,"" she said, her voice trembling with a fragile, newfound hope. ""See, Jen? It’s going to be okay. Tom will get us out of here."" She dipped a plush white towel into the warm water and began to gently wipe the drying blood from Jennifer’s face and arms. Jennifer remained pliant, her eyes vacant, but the rigid terror in her body seemed to lessen just a fraction.

Back in the loft, Tom scrambled over a pile of old crates, his eyes fixed on the blinking green light. As he reached for it, he felt a sudden, bone-deep chill, and the hairs on his arms stood on end. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flicker of absolute blackness that seemed to suck the light out of the air. Just then, A low hum started from the conduits, and before he could pull his hand back, a thick, jagged bolt of blue-white electricity erupted from the junction box, slamming into his outstretched hand.

The force was unimaginable, a physical blow that welded his flesh to the metal in a shower of sparks. His body went rigid, every muscle contracting at once in a tetanic spasm that arched his back violently. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat as his vocal cords seized. The smell of ozone was instantly overpowered by the sickeningly sweet stench of cooking meat and burning hair. His skin blackened and split where the current entered, the flesh blistering and popping.

A violent convulsion shook his entire frame, his limbs flailing wildly as if he were a marionette in the hands of a mad god. For a horrifying second, the electricity arced from his other hand to a nearby metal beam, creating a brilliant, terrible circuit with his body at the center. Then, with a final, explosive CRACK, the energy threw him backwards. He was flung through the air like a rag doll, his body limp, and slammed into a wooden support beam with a wet, final thud. He slid to the floor, a smoking, ruined thing. His eyes melted from their sockets, and a thin, greasy smoke curled from his open mouth and nostrils.

The deafening, explosive CRACK ripped through the barn, echoing from the second-floor loft, followed by a heavy, wet thud. The women froze, their eyes locking in a shared, unspoken terror. The silence that followed was deafening. ""Tom?"" Linda whispered, her voice barely audible. ""Tom?!"" she called out, louder this time, her voice cracking with a new, rising panic. She looked at Jennifer, who was now staring in the direction of the loft. Linda’s own courage, which had been so fragile just moments before, now hardened into a grim resolve. ""Stay here,"" she said, her voice low and firm. ""Don’t move. I’ll be right back.""

Linda slowly pulled out her phone and turned on the flashlight. She swallowed hard against a throat that was suddenly bone-dry. Her heart hammered against her ribs, but she pushed the fear down. Jennifer was depending on her. Tom was depending on her. She started moving, her small circle of light cutting a path through the thickening darkness, heading toward the location she thought she heard Tom shout.

As she passed the tall, rickety shelves of the storage area, a loud clatter from above made her jump. A stack of heavy-looking boxes tipped and then tumbled down, crashing onto the floor directly in her path and throwing up a cloud of dust. The way was blocked, she was forced to take a detour, her light now sweeping past the lounge area and toward the glass-enclosed sauna.

Suddenly, the sauna's interior lights flickered on, bathing the small, wood-panelled room in a soft, warm glow. The space was already thick with steam, and through the swirling vapor, she saw a figure. A man slumped on the bench. ""Tom!"" she cried out. All her fear, all her trepidation, was instantly erased by a wave of pure, desperate joy. She sprinted the remaining distance and threw the heavy glass door open, rushing inside.

""Tom, Baby, are you okay?"" she yelled, stepping into the wall of heat. The image of her husband flickered and dissolved into the swirling steam. A sudden, bone-chilling premonition washed over her. She spun around just as the heavy glass door slammed shut with the force of a guillotine. The sound of a lock clicked into place with absolute finality.

Outside the glass, standing by the control panel, was Tom. But it wasn’t Tom as she knew him. It was his corpse, its empty, dripping eye sockets fixed on her, as its blackened, smoking hand slowly, deliberately turned the temperature dial to the maximum setting. A strangled sob escaped her lips as she threw herself against the door, pounding on the thick, unyielding glass that was already hot to the touch.

She glanced at the digital display next to the door, its red numbers a mocking beacon in the swirling steam. They were climbing with impossible speed. 180°… 220°… 270°… The digits blurred as they ascended into a range that was no longer safe. Her first breath of the superheated steam was an agony she could never have imagined, a searing pain that felt like swallowing fire. It cooked the delicate tissues of her throat and lungs, and she began coughing and gagging, a thin, pink froth bubbling on her lips.

Her skin, already an angry, blotchy red, began to blister under the relentless assault of the wet, superheated air. The pain was a white-hot symphony of agony, a thousand needles piercing every inch of her body at once. A final, desperate surge of adrenaline gave her strength. She began blindly searching for any way out, her palms searing as she slapped them against the seamless wooden walls, looking for a panel, a vent, anything.

The air steam was so thick she could barely see through it now, and each breath was a fresh torment, scorching her throat and lungs until she could only manage shallow, ragged gasps. The edges of her vision began to darken as her body cooked from the inside out. She stumbled toward the glass door. As she drew near, the charred figure of her husband, who had been watching her motionlessly, glided to the other side of the glass. Now, inches away, Linda could see the full, gruesome details of its appearance. Tom’s eyes were gone, his skin blackened and split. What stood before her was not the man she loved but a grotesque mockery.

The sight, combined with the unbearable heat and the searing pain, was too much. A silent, hopeless sob shook her body, and the tears that streamed from her eyes turned to steam the moment they touched her blistering cheeks. Her legs gave out. She collapsed to the floor in a heap, the darkness in her vision surging inwards to consume her. As she lay dying, her gaze met Tom’s gaping, empty sockets, the ruined head tilted slowly to one side, and the blackened, lipless mouth stretched into something that could only be described as a smile.

Linda tried to scream, but no sound came. Her vision collapsed to a single point of light, then went black. Her body gave one final, violent shudder, and then she was still. The only movement in the sauna was the relentless rise of the steam, curling around her lifeless form like a shroud

Jennifer remained by the hot tub. She had heard the boxes fall, a loud, startling crash, and then… nothing. A profound, unnatural silence that felt heavier and more terrifying than any scream. Linda had gone to check on Tom, and now she was gone too.

Get up, she told herself, her voice a silent scream in her own mind. Get up, you have to move. You have to find her. The thought of Linda alone and possibly hurt gave her a surge of adrenaline, and she pushed herself to move.

She pulled out her phone and fumbled to turn on the flashlight, her fingers clumsy and slick with a mixture of water and sweat. Just as the beam clicked on, the barn’s high-end sound system exploded to life at maximum volume. A wall of distorted, screeching static slammed into her, so loud and so sudden. She screamed, and her phone flew from her grasp, arcing through the air before landing in the hot tub with a quiet. plink.

As the static roared, the barn's main lights flickered on, not the warm, inviting glow from before, but a harsh, sterile white that bleached all the color from the room. And in that light, she saw the massive main door, the one that had been barred and immovable, was now slightly ajar, a dark vertical slit of freedom in the wall of wood. Jennifer didn’t question it. She just ran. She threw her shoulder against the heavy door, grunting with effort, and managed to widen the gap just enough to squeeze her body through. She stumbled out into the cool night air, the sound of the screeching static still ringing in her ears, and sprinted for the main villa.

She burst through the unlocked front door, her breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps. The power was on. A soft, classical piece of music was playing. It was a scene of perfect, mocking normalcy. ""A phone,"" she gasped, her eyes darting around the entryway. ""I need a phone."" She ran through the downstairs rooms, her bare feet slapping against the cool terracotta tiles: the living room, the dining room, and the small study. Finally, in the dark, wood-panelled biblioteca, she found A vintage, rotary-style telephone sitting on the heavy oak desk. She lunged for it, her fingers closing around the heavy black receiver. She lifted it to her ear, her heart pounding with a desperate, fragile hope, but she was met by empty silence.

As she stood there, clutching the dead receiver, a loud, violent crash erupted from the back of the villa. It sounded like every pot and pan in a kitchen being thrown to the floor at once. Her head snapped up, her grief and terror momentarily replaced by a flicker of desperate hope. Linda?

She dropped the phone and ran to the large, professional-grade kitchen, its stainless-steel surfaces gleaming under the bright, modern lighting. The room was empty, but it was in complete chaos. Cabinet doors hung open, and bowls and plates were spilled onto the floor. Bags of flour and sugar had been ripped open, their white contents dusting every surface like a fine layer of snow. Jars of spices were shattered, their fragrant contents mixing into a strange, cloying potpourri.

""Linda?"" Jennifer whispered, her voice trembling. She took a slow, hesitant step into the room and scanned the destruction, her eyes darting from one mess to the next. A slight movement caught her eye, and she looked at a pile of pans. In each gleaming surface, the same impossible nightmare was reflected. It was standing right behind her. So close she could feel a profound, unnatural coldness radiating from it, a void where warmth and life were supposed to be.

Its skin was a waxy, translucent parchment, stretched so tight over its skeletal frame that she could see the dark, pulsing geography of veins beneath. Its limbs were impossibly long and thin, jointed in all the wrong places, and they moved with a constant, subtle series of micro-twitches and clicks, like a spider testing the strands of its web. The head was a smooth, elongated ovoid, like some deep-sea insect, and it lacked any feature save for two enormous, almond-shaped pits of polished obsidian that drank the light and reflected her own terrified face back at her, twisted into a mask of silent, screaming horror.

Its body was hairless and sexless, and adorned not with clothes, but with a lattice of intricate symbols carved directly into the parchment skin. They were not scars; they were fresh, raw, and they wept a thin, black, oily ichor that moved with a life of its own, slowly tracing the lines of the glyphs. A wave of primal, biological revulsion washed over her, so powerful it made her gag.

The primal revulsion that had frozen Jennifer in place finally broke, and a raw, piercing scream was torn from her throat. She spun around, her bare feet slipping on the flour-dusted floor, and scrambled for the doorway.

The entity didn’t move. It simply tilted its elongated head, and the fine layer of flour and sugar that dusted every surface began to stir, rising from the floor and counters in a swirling, ghostly white cloud. Then, the knives lifted from the magnetic block on the counter. The entire set rose into the air and formed a swirling, silver vortex in the center of the room, a tornado of polished, razor-sharp steel. The entity gestured, and she was lifted from her feet, suspended in the heart of the storm of blades.

The first knife, a long, thin boning knife, plunged into her thigh, and she screamed, a wet, gurgling sound. Another buried itself in her shoulder. The knives struck her from all directions, a brutal, percussive assault of piercing steel. They tore through her stomach, her arms, her legs, each impact a fresh wave of agony.

Finally, the heavy cleaver, which had been circling her like a patient shark, flew forward. It struck her square in the chest with a sound like a watermelon being split, burying itself to the hilt. Jennifer’s body was then slammed against the far wall, and the knives that were stuck into her began to push through her body, impaling her to the wall. Her head lolled forward, her lifeblood pouring from a score of wounds, a final, macabre masterpiece in the center of the chaos.

a thousand miles from the chaos, Julian Belrose sat in the cool, quiet darkness of his study. On one of his monitors, the four life-sign readouts, which had been spiking and plunging in a frantic dance, now settled into four, flat, serene lines. A faint, almost imperceptible smile played on his lips. He glanced at the secondary monitor, the livestream’s statistics. The viewer count had just ticked over to 3,000,000. A soft, pleasant ding echoed in the quiet of his study as another large donation rolled in.

He picked up a sleek burner phone from his desk and dialled a number from memory. It rang twice before a clipped, professional voice answered.

""Four this time,"" Julian said, his voice calm and even, ""And I need, re-containment.""

There was a pause on the other end. Julian listened, his eyes still on the flatlined monitors. ""Yes,"" he said, a hint of amusement in his voice. ""A dybbuk box.""

He listened for another moment, then ended the call and disassembled the phone, throwing the pieces in the trash can under his desk.

He turned his attention back to the livestream and typed a single, final message into the chat box: ""Till next time,"" and ended the stream.

I'm considering buying a Breville / Sage Bambino or Bambino+, and one of the breaking points is the portafilter.

I just read it on this sub that the normal Breville one is aluminum and nickel inlined - where the problem comes. I have sensitivity to nickel and using this portafilter to brew my espresso, then drinking the coffee, would certainly mess some things up on my insides on the long run.

So the question is, if I buy the normal Bambino, is there a possibility to switch out the portafilter to a better one, in a cost-efficient way?

And another question: is it of any advantage that the + is BPA-free? Or the normal Bambino has BPA-free plastic as well, it is just not mentioned anywhere?

i had a client add me then message me good morning. we exchanged a few messages about morning coffee and him being at work. then, i got a call from a family member so i stepped off my computer but kept my tabs and SP browser open. when i came back 1.5 hours later, i was about to start replying to the client again, but i noticed he removed me. i assume its because he saw that my status was ""online"" the whole time but i stopped replying for over an hour.

My name is Lucy. I am 65. I am experiencing another one of my daily “ I give the f\* up “ modes. I just don’t know what to do anymore to restore my gut health.

I have been at this for 8 years. My digestion was perfect for 57 years. I could eat anything and digest well. I had a morning bm like clockwork, in and out of the bathroom in less than 5 minutes.  It was way too much stress and some trauma that initiated my digestive problems.  So much water under the bridge since then.

I only learned about histamines and salicylates about 2 years ago. So all this time I was having high anxiety, panic attacks, nightmares, 3am histamine dumps, salicylates slumps and I didn’t know why. All these seemingly healthy foods , I was eating a ton of cooked spinach, we’re driving my symptoms out of control.

I really didn’t feel my gut that much until I underwent quadruple antibiotic treatment for h. Pylori in the summer of 2024.  My gut has never been the same. I had the breath test with Lactulose in fall of 2024. I registered in the 90’s for methane. I started Rifaximin and Neomycin. I only lasted 3 days. I was so sick I couldn’t get out of bed. If things get really bad for me there is no one to help me. I’m on my own.  Whatever protocol or herb or supplement I try comes with the risk of incapacitating me . I have to be able to still cook my food or drive to the grocery store. 

I began this journey weighing 153 lbs (69k). I am now 94 lbs.(42k). I am 5’3””.  I won’t dare look at myself naked. It frightens me. 

I got Covid Christmas 2020. That shifted all this into overdrive.

  
I have been eating chicken, rice, eggs, gf toast and butter for over a year. 98% of the time. I also drink limited coffee.

I have tried Atrantil. I reacted to it I think because of salicylates. I tried making a tea out of oregano, thyme and cloves. It was a very short brew of just 5 minutes. I couldn’t handle it. It gave me some very bad irritation in my bladder and urethra. I became very inflamed. So now I try Allimax drops. Just one drop sends my blood pressure up to 150 and I get nightmares from hell. What am I supposed to do?  I am at such a loss for ideas.

What am I going to try next? L. Reuteri baby drops? L.Rhamnosus GG?   
What is going to be my next bottle of hope?

I don’t even tolerate magnesium. 

How many of you guys are dealing with all this and are completely under financed? I haven’t worked in 8 years. Disability and food stamps here. Running out of money before the end of the month just adds to the stress.

I listen to meditations before bed every night. And music is my comfort during the day.

I have had a Biomesight stool’ test done recently. Confirmed the methane diagnosis. I don’t know how to load the results onto chatgp. And it only causes me more stress just trying to figure it out. I welcome any bright souls to help me with that.

I have a wonderful therapist I see on Telehealth once a week. What a blessing she has been. Because man, this has been a lonely trip. Mostly housebound.

I have my wall across from my desk plastered with words of encouragement and reminders to be grateful, to know the body can repair itself. Lots of notes to myself.  I have had blessings along the way for sure. A month ago the man in front of me at the checkout at the grocery store paid for my groceries. He had no clue what a difference that made for me.  

Yes, I am scared this “illness” could take me out. I don’t know how much more my heart can take of the histamine dumps. The malnourishment is obvious.

I love writing on the side, and my boss (who’s also my mentor) encourages me to connect with writers and build my network. There’s a part-time guy at our company (around 32M) who works remotely, and when I first joined, everyone kept mentioning what a talented and accomplished writer he is. He also sent me a LinkedIn request when I started. I thought we could talk about writing and exchange ideas.

About a month into the job, I messaged him on LinkedIn saying something like: *“Hey, long overdue but I’d love to properly introduce myself over coffee. Our office is tiny so it’d be nice for us all to get to know each other.”*  
He never responded.

Later that week, a coworker who’s close friends with him randomly mentioned how she’d had issues in the past with male coworkers asking to “get to know her” over coffee and how she had to report it. It might’ve been unrelated, but the timing felt… pointed. For context, I was engaged at the time (and got married shortly after), so it definitely wasn’t a flirty message.

He eventually came into the office once, acted surprised to learn I was getting married, but everything else felt normal and work-focused. By the way, I've had coffee with all the folks at my office, and have had e-coffees with those overseas to introduce myself. The company culture is definitely friendly and networking-oriented because of where my city is.

For extra context: I’m Armenian and moved to the U.S. about 5 years ago. I’ve run into a few situations where men here assumed I was being flirty when really it was just my personality (and honestly my culture) to be warm and friendly. Where I’m from, people grab coffee platonically across genders, give small gifts, and hang out without it being weird. Adjusting to how differently some people interpret that here has been… a learning curve.

Anyway, I let the whole thing go. My fiancé said he probably just missed the message.

A month later, the guy announced he was leaving the company. I replied to his goodbye email saying something like, *“Sorry to see you go, hope we can stay in touch. My boss and coworker have told me great things about you. My fiancé and I are also new in town and would love to make more friends.”*

He responded immediately with his number and said we should definitely schedule a coffee. I texted him the next day…and never heard back again. I'm obviously not going to pursue this but wanted to know what others thought.

TLDR: I asked a coworker (twice) if he wanted to grab coffee / be friends, and he ignored me both times except for one brief “let’s do it!” reply. Was I inappropriate somehow, or is he just flaky and I’m overthinking this?",9,1764709907.0,amiwrong,18,0.91,False

Hey Reddit,

I’m trying to figure out how people meet new friends or even partners when they’re… well… like me. I’m a gay man who’s introverted, socially awkward, and kind of a stoner  but I really do enjoy people, just in my own way.

Some days I can be super social and visit everyone, and then for the next couple of weeks I’m totally content grabbing a coffee and heading straight home. I don’t really watch TV because honestly, that’s when I feel the most alone. I’d rather be around someone I can laugh with about stupid things or just enjoy quiet company with.

I’m not looking for anything wild just connection. Someone who understands the ebb and flow of my energy, who doesn’t mind that I’m a mix of “let’s hang out” and “okay, that’s enough socializing for now.” Ideally someone kind, chill, and down for simple moments.

For other gay guys who are introverted or awkward: how did you meet people? Apps? Hobbies? Community spaces? Total accidents?

Any advice would seriously mean a lot.

Thanks 🙏

1pcklxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/1pcklxw/my_experience_using_spivey_consulting_i_got/,My Experience Using Spivey Consulting (I got rejected everywhere),"I hired a former Harvard Law School Admissions officer from Spivey Consulting for around $3000 to get comprehensive advice regarding my personal statement and other parts of the application. 

From the start, they all seemed incredibly busy as Mike Spivey himself took calls from me while walking his dogs and the former HLS officer attended meetings at coffee shops (I was barely able to hear her). But more importantly, my personal statement was returned with grammar/spelling mistakes still intact and her advice was very vague and generic.

I shared about my experience on Reddit and Mike messaged me. He asked me to identify myself and that it wouldn't impact the quality of consulting. I told him my name, then Mike Spivey offered to provide a refund. I should have taken it then but the former HLS admissions officer wanted to continue working with me, which I found weird at the time (I should have known then), so Mike Spivey relented.

When we started working together, the former HLS admissions officer told me to write an addendum explaining something that didn't really need explaining. She said it would help my application. So I wrote an addendum per her advice and she returned it to me with approval. I submitted the application (personal statement was still basically the same version as I had initially wrote it) and was rejected everywhere I applied, including Harvard Law School.

The next year, I applied on my own, and didn't write an addendum, and got into everywhere, including Harvard. So always take even former admissions officer's words of advice with caution as you never know what their true intentions are or whether they actually know how to write a winning personal statement. Judging an essay is radically easier than helping someone actually write a compelling one. 

Most of these admissions officers did not go to brand name schools themselves so they never had to actually write such an essay. So they ultimately don't know what steps you should take to write a compelling essay. They just know when an essay is compelling (which anyone whom you ask on the street can do).

1pckk1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreativeContent/comments/1pckk1l/why_smart_homes_are_becoming_a_global_standard/,Why Smart Homes Are Becoming a Global Standard,"Smart homes are no longer just a futuristic dream—they're quickly becoming the new norm across the globe. As technology becomes more accessible and affordable, people everywhere are embracing smart living for the convenience, efficiency, and peace of mind it brings. Let’s explore why smart homes are rising as a global standard and why this shift is so exciting.

**1. Unmatched Convenience**  
One of the biggest reasons people are turning to smart homes is the sheer convenience they offer. Imagine controlling your lights, thermostat, or even your coffee machine with just your voice or a tap on your phone. Whether you're at work, on vacation, or relaxing on your couch, smart systems give you complete control over your home environment. It's like having a personal assistant at your fingertips 24/7.

**2. Energy Efficiency and Savings**  
Smart homes aren't just about luxury—they're also helping people save money. Smart thermostats, lighting, and appliances are designed to use less energy by adapting to your habits and schedules. Over time, this means lower energy bills and a lighter impact on the environment. More people are making the switch not only to cut costs but to contribute to a greener planet.

**3. Enhanced Security and Peace of Mind**  
Home security is another area where smart technology shines. Smart cameras, sensors, and locks allow homeowners to monitor and control their property from anywhere in the world. You can get alerts if someone’s at your door or even check in on your pets while you're away. These features make it easier to feel safe, whether you’re home or not.

**4. Easy Integration with Daily Life**  
Smart homes are becoming easier to use every day. Many systems are now designed to work together seamlessly, meaning you don’t need to be tech-savvy to enjoy the benefits. The user-friendly interfaces and automation features fit right into modern lifestyles, making life smoother and more manageable.

**5. Future-Proofing Your Living Space**  
As technology continues to evolve, homes that are already equipped with smart systems will be better prepared for future advancements. From smarter health monitoring to AI-powered routines, the possibilities are expanding fast. Investing in smart home tech today means you're ready for the innovations of tomorrow.

In short, smart homes aren’t just a trend—they’re a lifestyle upgrade that’s here to stay.",1,1764709653.0,TheCreativeContent,0,1.0,False

So, weddings.  Always come with bonus drama, and I tried SO HARD to keep our wedding drama-free.  For a multitude of reasons, we downgraded our plans from an in-country destination wedding on the water to a local, low budget ordeal in the mountains.  My grandma lives in a fancy cabin up there, and had made noises about how happy she would be to have us get married in her woods, so it seemed a natural pivot.  

Since we'd changed the location, it now meant that about 1/3rd of our guests would be traveling when they hadn't planned on it, so we were scrambling to help people find convenient crash space.  (Our guest list had already dropped from like 60 to 30, so those 30 were very precious.)  One of the first people we helped find crash space for was the mutual friend that had introduced us.  They were bringing their two dogs, so we knew that added some difficulties to their travel plans, and we wanted to make everything as smooth as possible.  My grandma's best friend also owns one of the other cabins in their neighborhood, has dogs and a guest house, so we asked if Dog Friend (DF) could stay at their place, and GBF was happy to say yes.

Fast forward like 6 months, wedding is a few weeks out.  Everyone who is traveling in has crash space, most of them up the mountain somewhere.  My MoH, her husband and toddler, and a separate Special Guest (SG) were the only ones other than us not staying on the mountain; they'd gotten hotel rooms in our town about 40 minutes away.  Sudden house issues come up with GBF, and she won't be able to house DF anymore.  BUT!  She talked to ANOTHER one of their friends (Gracious Host - GH) in the neighborhood who also owns one of the SUPER nice cabins, and she and her daughter run it as an AirBnB.  They'd had a last-minute cancelation, and offered it up as an alternative place for DF to stay.  Great!  When I was told about this change, I asked Grandma and GBF if it would be okay for my MoH and SG to also stay at the AirBnB (OMG plenty of bedrooms), so that everyone (but us) would be up in the mountains where the wedding was actually happening.  They said they were sure that would be fine.  Sweet!  Problem solved!  Moving forward!

The day DF arrives, we meet her at the AirBnB and the Host's Daughter (HD) is the one that gives us the tour.  GORGEOUS house, beautiful view, I was SO HAPPY that people that were so important to me were going to have such a fantastic place to stay.  But the vibes from HD were...not great.  Some of it felt like City Mouse bestowing a great favor on Country Mouse (The income gap here is REAL), but I was also getting the feeling that she didn't know about the dogs?  Like, she mentioned AT LEAST 3 times that they usually charge an extra cleaning fee for dogs, and her whole attitude was just...pursed?  Like she'd bit a lemon.  But other than that everything went fine, DF gets settled in, the other guests eventually arrive and settle in, and we move on with wedding stuff.

The original plan had been to hold the ceremony in Grandma's backyard (literally just an arch for decor), and then the reception at the local gathering hall thing.  We'd asked DF to help set up the arch the morning of the wedding, and they were all over it.  As we're doing morning-of getting ready stuff, DF is communicating options for the location of the arch, and then DF and my Mom decide that the actual best location is the backyard of the AirBnB: It has more space, a better view, just all around best location for the wedding.  Mom and DF tried to ask GH if it would be okay to hold just the ceremony there, but couldn't get ahold of her.  So they made the executive decision to do it anyway, and told me not to worry about it.  Yes Mom.  Focusing on getting married.

Ceremony was beautiful, the pictures are gorgeous, it was more perfect that I ever pictured it being.  Wasn't overly long, then we headed to the reception while someone remained behind to break down the arch.  Small guest list, short ceremony, attempted to have minimal impact on GH.  Next morning people are rolling out, DF stops by on their way out of town to say goodbye.  They let us know that they had planned on doing a thorough clean of the AirBnB to get up dog hair and such, but had misunderstood the checkout time and lost an hour of cleaning time.  Noted.

This is where things actually start to go sideways.  HD is apparently LIVID at the state the cabin was left in.  Like, ranting to GBF livid.  It's apparently so bad that the next day, GBF's husband goes over with his checkbook and asks how much it would take to never hear about this again.  Shitty, but over and done with, right?  Nope.  HD gets ahold of MY MOTHER and asks to meet with her.  At this point, it's been 3 weeks since the wedding. 

 And she's got beef:

- They were only expecting 1 guest, not 5
- They were not expecting the dogs
- They expressly have a ""No Events"" policy for their AirBnB, so having the ceremony there was NOT OKAY
- Their plumbing was not up to the amount of guests that ended up staying there
- My brother and his gf had ended up crashing in one of the empty bedrooms and moved some furniture without moving it back, so GH and HD had to do it (neither one young - moving furniture is a young persons duty)
- The AirBnB was left so filthy that it took her cleaning lady 2 DAYS to clean

There might have been a couple other things, but those were the biggest issues.  So she's pissed, saying that no one treats her mother that way, that I'm entitled and I owe her mother an apology.  MY mother does the smile-and-nod thing, apologizes and says she will let me know to apologize to GH.  Once this is conveyed to me, I ask for a family meeting with Mom, Grandma and Grandpa, and GBF and her husband.  Communication breakdown seemed like the cause of a lot of these issues, and I wanted to make sure everyone involved was on the same page and had the same information because I had 2 major questions:

- What exactly did I do wrong in this situation that requires me to apologize?
- If I DIDN'T do anything wrong, and I'm just doing a performative apology to keep the peace, what exactly should I say?

The only people I could get to talk to me about it were Mom and Grandma, who were having side conversations with GBF.  Everyone else wanted nothing to do with it.  Apparently HD is notorious for being a little crazy, and not letting shit go.  So all the women involved just want me to apologize so they can move on.  To which I keep referring to the above questions: I don't mind apologizing to keep the peace, especially since we owe everyone so much for making the wedding happen, but it felt like I was getting thrown under the bus with no help when I had done NOTHING WRONG, which really hurt, especially since it was beginning to taint my memories of my wedding.

But wait, there's more!  While this is all simmering, I'm on the phone with my MoH and I vent my spleen about the situation.  So then SHE drops that bomb that it was the absolute worst AirBnB she's ever stayed at.  In addition to some generic complaints like linens and pillows, EVERY SINGLE DISH she tried to use, including silverware, was dirty (one coffee mug was completely coated in hair), and the kitchen was filthy, like the countertops were covered in dust.   She hadn't wanted to say anything because 1) don't stress the bride and 2) it was free, but once given permission, she unloaded.  And she confirmed what I had thought, that NONE of the special guests staying in that cabin would have left it such a mess that it required 2 DAYS to clean.

So, here we stand.  From my perspective, while they have at least one legit grievence (the ceremony), HD is essentially being a bully, and blowing the situation out of proportion to the point where she is extorting money from people.  Mom has come around to my way of thinking, but she tends to cave easily under pressure and agree with whoever is talking the loudest.  (I love my Mom, she amazing, she just didn't get the Mama Bear trait, which would be really nice right now)  Everyone else is just kind of willing to ignore it, but at the same time acknowledges that HD WILL NOT let this die.  Which means eventually I'm still going to have to deal with it.  In the meantime, I'm no longer comfortable going up to the cabin to visit, so she successfully drove an emotional wedge between me and my family, AND my memories of my wedding have this dark cloud hanging over them.  So I feel like I've already lost.  All that's left is the concession speech.  

Not a super social media person, so no guarantees I will respond to comments, but I would desperately love to hear some outside opinions on the situation.  Including some shields and swords for whenever she eventually does get in my face...",12,1764709550.0,EntitledPeople,28,0.66,False

1pcki46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1pcki46/two_months_of_physical_symptoms_loss_of_appetite/,Two months of physical symptoms + loss of appetite — is this still anxiety? Need perspective.,"I’m a 24-year-old male dealing with pretty intense health anxiety over the last 2 months, and I’m trying to figure out how much of what I’m experiencing is “normal” for anxiety vs. something I should be more concerned about. I’ve had multiple tests done already but can’t shake the fear.

How it all started (early October):

Everything began with sudden GI issues: loose stools, early-morning urgency, stomach discomfort, and a big drop in appetite, though I've been able to maintain/gain weight due to calorie tracking. The GI stuff has slowly improved a bit (stools trending more normal now), but the loss of appetite has NOT gone away, and that’s becoming the biggest thing I’m fixated on.

Symptoms I’ve had over the last 8 weeks:

	•	Loss of appetite (not nausea, just no desire for food)

	•	Looser stools earlier on, now mostly type 4–5 with some off days

	•	Early morning urgency to poop, sometimes around 5–7 AM

	•	Chills in my torso + facial flushing episodes (face/ears get red and hot) this began to occur while waiting for my MRI results last week. 

	•	Sleep fragmentation and waking up with moist underwear/back of knees the past few nights. (not night sweats)

	•	Tingling in one foot (left), mostly when sitting (started happening a week ago)

	•	Jaw clenching

	•	Random muscle twitches

	•	Feeling “off” or wired after coffee

	•	mild nausea (a few times) 

	•	Generalized “on edge” feeling most days

Tests I’ve already done:

	•	CBC, CMP, ESR → all normal

	•	Urine test → normal

	•	TSH thyroid test → normal (1.2)

	•	Fecal occult blood tests (at home) → negative

	•	Prenuvo Torso MRI (covers chest/abdomen/pelvis) → no masses, no organ issues, nothing concerning found

Despite all this, my appetite still hasn’t fully returned, and I still get physical symptoms like chills and random foot tingling that freak me out.

What’s scaring me:

	•	Loss of appetite for this long

	•	Physical symptoms changing over time

	•	Fear that something was missed (cancer, tumor, infection, etc.)

	•	Fear that if it was “just anxiety,” it should’ve been better by now

	•	Thinking about getting more tests (head/neck MRI) even though the torso MRI was clean

My actual question:

For those who’ve had long-lasting anxiety episodes:

Can anxiety realistically cause loss of appetite, GI changes, random chills, flushing, tingling, and sleep issues for 2 straight months, even when tests are normal?

Did anyone else lose interest in food for this long without it being something serious?

I’m trying to avoid more unnecessary tests, but it’s hard when the physical symptoms keep shifting.

Any reassurance, similar experiences, or advice would really help.

Stadium Arcadium for Winter, The Getaway for Spring, Californication for Summer, and One Hot Minute for Fall. My question is, what singular song (not necessarily on any of these albums) represents each season the best, or at least gives that vibe the most? Thoughts? (My personal thoughts: Winter: Snow(Hey Oh), Spring: Sick Love, Summer: Quixoticelixer, Fall: Coffee Shop) I’m curious to hear what other people think.",1,1764709153.0,RedHotChiliPeppers,9,0.67,False
1pckbu6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pckbu6,Can anyone sanity check my circuit design?  Replacing a traditional switch for an Off-Delay Relay,"The first image is what I believe to be the correct design.  The second is the original unmodified circuit.

What you're looking at here, is the wiring for an Espresso maker.  It has 4 traditional rocker switches: Main power (IG), Steam (IV), Hot Water (IA), and Brew (IC).  It obviously runs on A/C.  I had to add some flow arrows so I could better visualize the completion of each circuit, with the various switches flipped.

The steam effectively just by passes Thermostat 1 so the boiler can get hotter.

The Hot Water activates the pump (PO).

The Brew activates both the Pump (po) as well as the 3 way Solenoid (EG).

Brewing coffee requires you flip the switch, and then flip it off when you're done.  Its how it really ought to be done.  But my wife wants a one button to push type of situation.  To further complicate it, you could make 1 shot, or 2 shots at a time.  So the amount of time the brew needs to run depends on that.

To give the wife what she wants, I'm going to replace the traditional switch with an Off-Delay Relay, which is triggered by a 3 position momentary contact.  Its a standard sized switch, so it will fit right where the normal switch goes.  I have plenty of room inside the machine to fit my relays, so thats not a problem.

But the challenge is that the traditional switch for brewing completes two wire legs.  If I'm right, this actually isnt needed.  However, with the Hot Water switch also activating the pump, I had to ensure that it wouldnt trigger the solenoid; which the 2 leg brew switch ensured.

Can anyone validate if I've got it right?  I may have to switch the position of my Blue and Purple wires, because I cant really tell which side is meant to be hot, and which side is common.  But I'll be able to tell once I do some continuity checks when I have it opened up.",1,1764709147.0,ElectricalEngineering,0,1.0,False

Smucker Company reported a solid second quarter with revenue slightly exceeding estimates and EPS slightly below expectations. The company highlighted strong growth in key brands such as Uncrustables, Café Bustelo, Milk Bone, and Meow Mix, driven by targeted innovations, expanded distribution, and marketing efforts. Despite inflationary pressures and cost increases, the company remains confident in its strategic focus on brand investment, portfolio transformation, and debt reduction, maintaining an optimistic outlook for long-term growth.

Highlights:

1. Key brands like Uncrustables and Café Bustelo delivered notable growths, with Uncrustables net sales up 7% and Café Bustelo increasing by 41%, supported by innovation, marketing, and distribution expansion, including into convenience channels.

2. The company is making strategic moves to streamline its Hostess brand and reduce SKU counts, aiming to stabilize performance and unlock long-term growth potential, with progress on facility closures and refreshed marketing campaigns.

3. Pricing actions across categories, especially in coffee, helped offset rising commodity costs; however, tariffs impacted profitability, though recent trade policy changes on green coffee may improve cost recovery moving forward.

4. Segment performance varied, with U.S. retail coffee net sales up 21% but segment profit down 24% due to higher input costs and tariffs; pet foods showed mixed results with a 7% sales decline but slight profit improvement.

5. Fiscal 2026 outlook reflects modest net sales growth of approximately 3.5-4.5%, with stable gross margins and disciplined expense management, expecting adjusted EPS in the range of $8.75 to $9.25, factoring in tariff impacts and market conditions.

Actionable Takeaways:

1. Focus on the company's innovation pipeline, particularly in key growth brands like Uncrustables and Café Bustelo, which are poised to drive future sales momentum through new product launches and expanded channels.

2. Monitor the impact of ongoing supply chain efficiencies and cost management initiatives, especially the planned closure of manufacturing facilities that aim to deliver significant savings and improve margins.

3. Evaluate the effects of changing trade policies and commodity prices on cost structure and pricing strategies, noting the potential for improved cost recovery following recent tariff adjustments.

4. Consider the company's long-term debt reduction plan, which aims to de-leverage the balance sheet to foster financial flexibility and support continued investments in growth platforms.

5. Stay alert to category trends in pet foods, baked snacks, and coffee, as these segments reflect evolving

1pck8yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1pck8yw/the_priest_at_one_of_my_local_parishes_usa_is_an/,The priest at one of my local parishes (USA) is an obnoxious insufferable a-hole. I am speaking as a non-orthodox atheist who wanted to learn more about the faith. I want to share a couple parts of emails he sent to everyone seeking to learn about Orthodoxy.,"First e-mail I get: Subject ""Church Etiquette Reminders - Entering and Exiting the Church""

Dear Members of \[Church Name Edited Out by OP for Privacy\],

God willing, this email finds you all well as we continue through the Nativity Fast preparing for the celebration of the Nativity of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

This email is a gentle reminder for our Church family regarding Church etiquette. We should make every effort to be at \[Church Name Edited Out by OP for Privacy\] prior to the beginning of the Divine Liturgy and to remain in the nave of the Church (the main part of the Church containing the pews where the people gather) during the entire service.

That being said, unavoidable circumstances may cause us to occasionally arrive after the beginning of the Divine Liturgy. Also, we may need to exit the nave of the Church to take a crying baby to the cry-room, feed or nurse a baby, or use the restroom. However, there are certain times during the Divine Liturgy when we should NOT be moving about the Church, either entering or exiting the nave of the Church. Wherever we happen to be at these moments (including in the narthex or vestibule), we should stop in place and stand reverently until the proper moment to enter or exit the nave of the Church. These times are:

1. Whenever the priest blesses the congregation or is otherwise facing the congregation

during the Divine Liturgy.

2. While the priest is censing the icons and people (facing the congregation) during the

Doxology (which occurs right before the beginning of the Divine Liturgy) and prior

to the Great Entrance.

3. During the opening exclamation of the Divine Liturgy, when the priest intones,

“Blessed is the Kingdom . . . .”

4. During the Small Entrance - the procession of the clergy with the Holy Gospel

preceded by the altar boys.

5. During the reading of the Epistle and Gospel.

6. During the sermon.

7. During the Great Entrance - the procession of the clergy with the Holy Gifts preceded

by the altar boys.

8. During the recitation of the Nicene Creed and the Lord's Prayer.

9. During the Consecration of the Holy Gifts. (from “Singing the victory hymn, proclaiming .

. . .” through “Especially for our most holy, pure, blessed, and glorious Lady . . . .”)

10. During the closing of the Divine Liturgy (“Glory to You, O God . . . .”)

11. During any special services such as Chrismations, Churching of a Baby (40-Day

Blessing), Memorials, or Blessings of Palms, Grapes, etc.

We should review these guidelines carefully so that we may honor our Lord by respectfully entering and exiting the nave of the Church at the appropriate times.

Should there by any questions or if we need any more information, please feel free to contact the church office at \[Phone #\].

In Christ,

\[Church Name Edited Out by OP for Privacy\] Office

Okay, my thoughts on this email. For context, I literally went to another Orthodox Church in my city that had a Catechism class, and it was a relaxed atmosphere where I just enjoyed sipping my coffee while learning about the faith. Seemed chill. But this particular churches Catechism class says ""NO FOOD or DRINK during sessions"".

Like What the Actual F\*ck is wrong this guy? I mean seriously. I can't believe how insane this guy sounds. It's cracking me up.  Like is this normal? Is most of Orthodoxy this obnoxious?

1pck80o,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pck80o/horror_story_at_sea_sailors_voyages_whispers_over/,Horror story at Sea - Sailors Voyages: Whispers Over The Waves - part 1,"The North Sea stretched out in every direction like an endless expanse of slate, its surface restless with ripples and swells that caught the gray light of a sky swollen with heavy clouds. James adjusted the tiller of his small yacht, the Seabird, and exhaled through his teeth. The cold air stung his lungs, sharper than the cup of coffee that had gone lukewarm in its steel thermos beside him.

It was supposed to be a solitary trip, one man, one boat, a short voyage across to the coast of Norway. He had told himself he needed the silence. He had told himself that isolation was cleansing, a way to burn off the fatigue of city life.

But out here, surrounded by heaving water and the endless sigh of wind, James already felt a prickling unease. Solitude had teeth, and they were starting to graze his skin.

He tightened his jacket, the fabric crackling in the cold. The Seabird creaked as it dipped into a trough and rose again, sails straining. Somewhere beneath, the keel hummed against the unseen pressure of the deep.

And then he heard it.

A sound, faint and almost lost beneath the slap of waves.

A melody.

James blinked and turned his head. At first, he thought it was the groan of wood or the trick of wind through rigging, but it lingered too long, too steady. Thin voices, high, soft, wavering as though carried through water were singing.

Children.

The hair on his arms stood on end. He couldn’t make out the words, but the cadence was unmistakable: a nursery rhyme tune, fragile and looping, drifting across the dark water.

James gripped the tiller harder. “It’s the wind,” he muttered to himself, his own voice startlingly loud in the hollow silence of the sea. “Just the wind.”

But the wind didn’t rhyme. The wind didn’t laugh between verses, like children trying not to giggle.

He shuddered and busied himself with adjusting the sails, forcing his thoughts to focus on practicalities. Compass steady. Course true. No vessels in sight on the horizon. That was good. Normal.

Normal was what he needed.

Hours passed. The day never brightened fully, clouds hung low, threatening rain but never delivering more than mist. James ate a protein bar, drank the last of his coffee, and tried not to listen for the sound again.

But the sea was a cruel trickster. Every so often, just as his mind began to wander into daydreams, he caught it again: a faint chorus, rising and falling with the swell, singing as though from just beyond the next wave. Always distant, never close enough to pinpoint.

It was worse than if it had been loud.

By nightfall, the sky was ink-black and the sea turned reflective, the yacht bobbing in darkness. James lit the navigation lamps, their glow painting the deck in weak red and green. The world shrank to the size of his vessel; everything beyond was void.

He sat in the cockpit, flashlight on his lap, and let exhaustion seep into his bones. Alone. Utterly alone.

The voices came back stronger in the night.

This time, he could almost hear words, fragmented, elongated, warped by the vast emptiness around him. He thought he heard ring around the rosie… but slower, slurred, and punctuated by whispers.

James clamped his palms over his ears. “Stop,” he hissed. His heart drummed against his ribs. “There’s nothing out there.”

The boat creaked, and for a split second he thought he heard footsteps above him, light, rapid, like children chasing each other across the deck. He snapped his flashlight on and swung it across the yacht. White beam cutting through mist. Nothing. Just the wet gleam of varnished wood, ropes coiled neatly, sails swaying overhead.

He laughed shakily. “You’re losing it, James.”

Still, he locked the cabin door when he went below.

Inside, the Seabird’s cabin felt claustrophobic. The walls were close, the air thick with diesel and salt. James lay in the narrow berth, boots still on, eyes fixed on the ceiling. The rhythmic slap of water against the hull was soothing, almost hypnotic.

Until it wasn’t.

A new sound joined the water’s lullaby. Tap. Tap. Tap.

He froze.

It was coming from outside, against the hull. Like small hands drumming on the wood. Too light to be debris, too deliberate to be chance.

He sat up, every muscle tight. “Waves,” he told himself. “Just waves hitting the side.” But even as he whispered it, the tapping continued, slow and deliberate, circling the cabin from one side to the other.

As though something was walking along the outside of the boat.

James grabbed his flashlight and climbed back up to the cockpit, breath steaming in the air. He swept the beam across the deck, into the water, across the sails. Nothing. Just endless sea, rolling black beneath a sky that had swallowed every star.

But the tapping had stopped.

He stayed above for hours, pacing the deck until his legs ached, straining to catch the faintest sound. He didn’t hear the voices again that night, but he felt them, their absence heavier than their presence, like children hiding in the dark, waiting for him to relax.

He didn’t sleep.

Dawn came reluctantly, pale light bleeding across the horizon. James’s eyes were bloodshot, his face drawn. He brewed another pot of bitter coffee and forced down a slice of bread. The sea was calmer now, smooth swells like the heaving chest of some sleeping giant.

For a few precious hours, there was only silence. He almost convinced himself the voices had been a hallucination, born from isolation, fatigue, the tricks of wind and water.

But then, just past noon, as the Seabird drifted through a patch of fog, he heard them again.

This time closer.

The singing was faint, but clear enough to make out words now. A childish chant, repeated over and over, weaving around the creak of the mast:

“We all fall down…”

The rhyme broke off in a burst of high-pitched giggles. James dropped his cup, hot coffee splashing across the deck. His hands trembled as he stared into the fog, which curled around the boat like grasping fingers.

“Hello?” he shouted, voice cracking. “Is someone there?”

Only silence answered. Then, splash. Something hit the water off the port side. James swung the tiller, straining his eyes. Shapes shifted in the fog, darker patches among the gray. He thought, just for a heartbeat, that he saw a small figure bobbing in the waves. A child’s head, hair plastered to pale skin, mouth open in a grin.

He blinked, and it was gone.

The voices erupted again, louder this time, circling the yacht.

James stumbled back, chest heaving. His pulse thundered. “Not real,” he whispered. “Not real, not real.” But his hands were already clenching the flashlight like a weapon, his eyes darting at every sound.

Something brushed the hull again, dragging, scraping, like fingernails trailing across wood.

He thought of shipwrecks, of the drowned, of stories he had half-listened to in bars about sailors lost at sea, bodies never recovered. The idea clawed at him: what if the children were real? What if they were still here?

The fog thickened, swallowing the horizon. The sea became a blind labyrinth, every sound magnified, distorted. James’s mind spun. He gripped the tiller and forced the Seabird forward, praying the fog would break.

But the voices stayed with him.

And when night fell again, they sang him into darkness.",2,1764708912.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1pck7do,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_z7k_s2/comments/1pck7do/the_neighbor_from_apartment_309/,The Neighbor From Apartment 309,"
So this literally happened last week and I still don’t know whether to laugh or cry.

I (18F) live in a pretty chill building, where nothing exciting ever happens… until the girl in Apartment 309 moved in.

Let’s call her Maya.

Maya is the kind of girl who looks like she’s in a constant music video oversized hoodie, perfect eyeliner, iced coffee at all hours of the day. Cool girl vibes. Everyone liked her. Even I did… until everything went sideways.

So one night I’m chilling in my room when I hear loud banging on my door at 2 AM. I literally thought someone was breaking in. I open it and see Maya, completely panicked, whisper-yelling:

“Can I hide in your apartment for like 10 minutes? PLEASE.”

Now listen… when someone says that to you at 2 AM, your brain should say no. But my dumb self said “yeah sure come in.”

She runs inside, sits on my couch, and starts breathing like she just escaped a zombie attack. Before I can ask anything, there’s ANOTHER knock on my door this one firm, heavy, the “open this damn door” kind of knock.

Maya looks at me and goes:

“Don’t. Say. Anything.”

At this point I’m thinking she committed a crime or something. Maybe she stole something. Maybe she murdered someone. Maybe she’s involved in some mafia Netflix-level drama.

I open the door slightly, and there’s this guy. Tall, angry, holding a broken bouquet of flowers like he fought a war with them.

“Is Maya in there?” he asks.

I swear my soul left my body.

But before I answer, Maya literally crAWLS behind my sofa to hide. CR-A-W-L-S. Like a toddler playing hide and seek.

So now I’m standing there like an NPC in a loading screen.

I say, “Uh… no?”

The guy squints at me, gives me that “you’re lying” look, and then says:

“Well, tell her she left her phone, her keys, AND her cat in my apartment.”

HER. CAT.

I close the door slowly and turn to look at Maya and I’m like:

“Girl. Your cat???”

She sighs and goes, “Ugh, he’s DRAMATIC.”

You ran out at 2 AM. You left your cat. He knocked like the police. This is not “dramatic,” this is chaos.

Turns out they got into a fight because he told her “she can’t keep adopting random animals she finds on the street.” She got offended, said he doesn’t understand her “rescue girl era,” grabbed her iced coffee, and stormed out.

The relationship is 3 weeks old.

Anyway, after hiding in my apartment for an hour, she FINALLY goes back. I go to sleep thinking it’s over.

Next morning?

She knocks again.

This time with a muffin.

“Thank you for saving me last night,” she says, “If we break up, you’re getting the cat.”

…Ma’am I don’t even LIKE cats.

And the worst part?

THEY’RE STILL TOGETHER.

I still hear them fighting about “rescue girl era.”

And the cat?
The cat likes to sit outside my door now like it’s his part-time job.

The red cherry one came from my wife's aunt who had it potted at her house. The yellow cherry one came from her uncle (different side of the family) and is supposedly the coffee they planted on her grandfather's farm years ago. They call it Catuai or something like that here. I see there's another one called yellow bourbon but I'm not sure of the difference.

I've harvested once before from the red one a couple years ago, just enough for a single cup of coffee but the taste is absolutely amazing and has so many other flavors. If you've ever had a hot drink made with evaporated cane juice it had some of the same tastes.

I'm picking and drying the cherries on the flash, then when they're dry I take the cherry off and continue to dry the seed inside the shell until it cracks open when I pinch it. Drying on flesh is something I saw some people do from Brazil and thought I'd try and I like the result. It's like honey+, while honey is drying without the cherry but with another sweet she'll around the seed.",21,1764708802.0,BackyardOrchard,5,1.0,False

1pck37u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1pck37u/two_months_of_physical_symptoms_loss_of_appetite/,Two months of physical symptoms + loss of appetite — is this still anxiety? Need perspective.,"I’m a 24-year-old male dealing with pretty intense health anxiety over the last 2 months, and I’m trying to figure out how much of what I’m experiencing is “normal” for anxiety vs. something I should be more concerned about. I’ve had multiple tests done already but can’t shake the fear.

How it all started (early October):

Everything began with sudden GI issues: loose stools, early-morning urgency, stomach discomfort, and a big drop in appetite, though I've been able to maintain/gain weight due to calorie tracking. The GI stuff has slowly improved a bit (stools trending more normal now), but the loss of appetite has NOT gone away, and that’s becoming the biggest thing I’m fixated on.

Symptoms I’ve had over the last 8 weeks:

	•	Loss of appetite (not nausea, just no desire for food)

	•	Looser stools earlier on, now mostly type 4–5 with some off days

	•	Early morning urgency to poop, sometimes around 5–7 AM

	•	Chills in my torso + facial flushing episodes (face/ears get red and hot) this began to occur while waiting for my MRI results last week. 

	•	Sleep fragmentation and waking up with moist underwear/back of knees the past few nights. (not night sweats)

	•	Tingling in one foot (left), mostly when sitting (started happening a week ago)

	•	Jaw clenching

	•	Random muscle twitches

	•	Feeling “off” or wired after coffee

	•	mild nausea (a few times) 

	•	Generalized “on edge” feeling most days

Tests I’ve already done:

	•	CBC, CMP, ESR → all normal

	•	Urine test → normal

	•	TSH thyroid test → normal (1.2)

	•	Fecal occult blood tests (at home) → negative

	•	Prenuvo Torso MRI (covers chest/abdomen/pelvis) → no masses, no organ issues, nothing concerning found

Despite all this, my appetite still hasn’t fully returned, and I still get physical symptoms like chills and random foot tingling that freak me out.

What’s scaring me:

	•	Loss of appetite for this long

	•	Physical symptoms changing over time

	•	Fear that something was missed (cancer, tumor, infection, etc.)

	•	Fear that if it was “just anxiety,” it should’ve been better by now

	•	Thinking about getting more tests (head/neck MRI) even though the torso MRI was clean

My actual question:

For those who’ve had long-lasting anxiety episodes:

Can anxiety realistically cause loss of appetite, GI changes, random chills, flushing, tingling, and sleep issues for 2 straight months, even when tests are normal?

Did anyone else lose interest in food for this long without it being something serious?

I’m trying to avoid more unnecessary tests, but it’s hard when the physical symptoms keep shifting.

Any reassurance, similar experiences, or advice would really help.

1pck2xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autism_Parenting/comments/1pck2xg/what_therapies_should_i_be_asking_for_does_this/,What therapies should I be asking for? Does this sound like any of your children at 18 months?,"I am headed into my son’s 18 month appointment and I do believe that our pediatrician will make some referrals at my request- for either an evaluation or therapy. He’s been very much on the “wait and see” path but I see what I see in my son and I’m tired of waiting. Here is a profile of him at 18 months and I’m curious how similar it may be to any of your children, and where you started with therapies to help with some of the challenges. Some of the private clinics offer speech, occupational, and I think there are some ABA places as well. Of course I will look to my pediatrician for guidance, but so far he has kind of brushed off my concerns. 

  
1. Expressive language- my son has many words- 50+ and has been speaking since 12 months. but they are mostly nouns- animal sounds, colors, shapes, foods, people, items. he does a lot of labeling. he has very little functional words- he says help help, up to be picked up, signs more and all done, and likes to say go in ready, set, go. he doesn’t conversationally babble, he does not put two words together. He does not answer yes or no with words or gestures.

  
2. pointing- the big one, completely absent. zero pointing to request or show. does not understand it despite months of showing. he does follow a point and follow our gaze. we can direct his attention to something easily. he also does not show us toys or items for the sake of showing. 

  
3. No real pretend play. He can feed a baby doll or talk on the phone but this has been taught, it’s not natural to him or something he does for fun

  
4. he does have pretty good imitation skills. He will take my coffee cup out of the dish washer and put it under the keurig, hang ornaments on the tree, put our car keys up to the door lock, clean the floor with a rag. he’s pretty perceptive about what’s happening around him. 

5. does a lot of things for attention and praise. We have several little inside jokes like smelling his feet to say they are stinky that he initiates. they are a bit routined though. another example, he knows not to stand on the couch, so he will often do it with kind of a menacing little grin to hear me say no. 

6. excellent receptive language. Knows all his body parts, can point to things in books, knows colors, shapes, can follow several two step commands, unless I’m way off base I do think he has decent receptive language for his age. I’m not entirely sure what’s expected but I think it’s pretty good. 

  
7. some stimming? He does like to walk on his toes, he will occasionally bang objects on the floor, and he loves running around. he also loves to bury his head in my neck and check in for a deep cuddle several times a day. I think he’s very sensory seeking

8. All in all, very engaged with his parents. Loves to be with us at all times. His play is pretty simple- reading books, knocking down block towers, shape sorter. But for the few things he likes to play with, he likes to be doing it with us. He’s not super interested in toy trucks or cars or balls or coloring.

  
9. good memorization. he can fill in a lot of the ABCs as I prompt him, can fill in words in nursery songs as I sing them. 

10. zero interest in other kids. I have seen him observe them and he sometimes will try an activity they are doing. But he doesn’t really care at all to play with them. ",2,1764708586.0,Autism_Parenting,1,1.0,False

i'm trying to be responsible over here and get stuff done, like go to a food pantry and grab distilled water for my cpap. i'm also very genuinely trying to get to a friend of mine out of a toxic and abusive household for a night.

i understand how weird and pathetic i am right now, really really really i get it. i'm also this level of desperate over here 😟

if you would like a receipt to prove the money went for gas or anything like that, i'm happy to do that. offering this because i know a lot of folks are hesitant to just give money away to a total stranger like this and likely think i'll spend the money on stupid shit.


i have 1 dot of gas left in my car, $2 cash, and a whopping $3 in the bank <- see pics 2-4 for financials 🤦‍♀️😵😵‍💫😖😞

i hope at least one person out there might be kind and compassionate enough to help me out just this little bit, please 🤞🙏

1pcjzwf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pcjzwf,Updated - Add Brew Shot Timer,"SECOND UPDATE - I had to really study the diagram to understand the flow of electricity.  Its actually a much more trickier circuit than I first thought.  I added some flow arrows to help me visualize it a bit better. (I understand A/C.  I just needed a way of keeping track of how a circuit gets completed).  It gets really strange at the junction between thermostat 1 and the pump.  Anyways, I think I've got it correct now.  Notably, the pumps circuit has to pass through the Solenoid to complete during a brew cycle.  It always did pass this way with the regular switch.  But with the regular switch having two legs, it had an additional path of least resistance.  So theres a chance this may cause some added wear to the solenoid.  But considering the pump is only 40 watts, I dont think this will matter at all.

I'm going to cross post on an electrical engineer sub to see if anyone that really knows circuits well, can provide some feedback.

PREVIOUS UPDATE - I already see a flaw in my cabling for the solenoid.  I've got to figure out my work  around.  So I'll post and updated diagram in a bit. (FIRST DIAGRAM REMOVED)

  
  
Instead of keeping the old flip switch, this updated design has a three way rocker momentary contact.  Coincidentally it has I II and 0 for its markers.  I'll plan to use I for single shot, and II for double shot.

At Junction IC in the wiring diagram, I am removing the original brew switch, which will be replaced with what I'm showing.  Then to handle the timing I'll have to use two separate relays.  I'll have to do a lot of test brews to determine exactly how much time 1 shot vs 2 shots takes.  Although I'd love to hear from you all of what your typical brew time is from start to finish (not just when coffee begins to form).

I'll plan to hide the two relays in the middle space; which is where the solenoid sits.  Should be plenty of room for both of them.

Even though the original toggle switch breaks both neutral and hot for both the solenoid and pump, I'm just going to hard wire that leg together.  Breaking the one leg should be sufficient.

For those who hadnt seen my previous post, this is a gift for my wife.  She wanted it simplistic.  Rather than downgrading to a machine that does this, I'd rather make this unit do exactly what she wants.  Its certainly not going to give us Barrista perfect brews.  But it should give my wife what she wants.

Any thoughts?  Anyone with electronics/electrical knowledge see any flaws?

I’m looking for 3-5 players to join my new D&D 5e (2014 rules) homebrew campaign inspired by “Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and “Dispatch”: Espresso K’Nights ...a floating, teleporting coffee tavern by day and a vigilante dispatch headquarters by night.
 This campaign blends workplace comedy, heartfelt character-driven storytelling, and street-level action and mystery in a world where your barista shift matters just as much as your nighttime adventures.
If you want a campaign that balances cozy slice-of-life chaos with action comedy, and high stakes adventure , this might be your perfect fit.

 The Campaign: Espresso K’Nights
Players work at a magical sky-tavern that drifts across the realm.
 By day, you’ll handle barista shifts, eccentric customers, coworker drama, and side gigs.
 By night, you become K’Nights ...vigilantes dispatched to investigate magical anomalies, solve crimes, and uncover a growing conspiracy affecting every region the tavern teleports to.
We lean heavily into:
Immersive, character-focused roleplay


Found-family vibes


Player-driven choices


Workplace systems (shift scores, side gigs, reputation)


Investigations and branching night missions


Cinematic storytelling with humor, tension, and consequences


Your actions during the day can literally change your odds of survival at night.
 Your decisions during night missions shape where the tavern goes next ...and how the world sees the K’Nights.

 What I’m Looking For
A roleplay-forward player who enjoys character arcs, connections, and chaos


Someone committed to consistent weekly attendance


A collaborative storyteller who lifts others up and respects table vibes


Someone who enjoys comedy, heart, mystery, and teamwork


Players comfortable with a balance of lighthearted daytime fun + serious night missions


Absolutely no evil-aligned or disruptive loner characters


Someone absolutely certain they can make Wednesday night sessions at 9 PM PST (3–4 hours).

☕ The Party 
Retired Legendary Bard and Folk hero Ziggy stardust is forming Misfit crew to work as baristas by day and vigilantes at night. I encourage a wide range of characters. If you can justify why they’d end up working in a sky-tavern and taking night dispatch jobs, it’s welcome. Any class or species can fit. Creativity is celebrated.


Interested? Reach Out!
If Espresso K’Nights sounds like your kind of adventure, message me with:
Your name or what youd like to be called
Your Discord name


Your D&D experience


The kind of character you’d love to play


What your favorite slice of life campaigns, shows, movies, anime, game (anything you want to share that attracts you to a campaign like this)


Grab your apron, take your dispatch stone, and join the crew.
 There’s a whole realm that needs brewing, serving, and saving ...one shift at a time.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

I am new to espresso machines and recently decided on the Profitec Pro 300 Dual Boiler Espresso Machine. What would you recommend that I purchase to help improve the quality of my coffee? I love good espresso (I don't know too much about espresso to be able to tell you much about what kind I like) and milk drinks!

To start, I'm considering a puck screen - does the type of puck screen that I get matter? Can I get something cheap and get away with a lot?

For a milk pitcher, I was going to find something cheap (I read online that they're all basically the same), but if anyone has any recommendations, I'll take those as well!

The order I placed comes with a free Brewista Smart Scale III - any thoughts on this?

Any other tips would be appreciated! I am just looking forward to making some good coffee!

Is it a decent way to meet women compared to apps or does it mostly lead nowhere?

If you're like me, you may have recently went from using a liquid or a pod to owning several powders (detergents, boosters, citric acid) and need some scoops. 

Well, let me tell you something about people who've recently had kids; they have tons of extra 1 tbsp scoops from their powdered formula. If you ask, you'll have anywhere from a handful the next day to set least one in about two weeks. They also make awesome coffee scoops, lol. 

The scoop on the left is a 1/4 cup and these are usually found in protein powders and shakes. You might be thinking what guy in your office is drinking a cup of BeefCake™ for breakfast but you'd be looking in the wrong direction. You need to be asking women _(who may or may not be over 40yrs old)_ in the office if they have extra scoops.

The bed shook violently beneath me, creaking unbearably. Moans—sharp, sultry, not mine—grew louder. A sudden, familiar low growl exploded in my ear. I rolled toward the sound, heart hammering, pulse racing, a mix of fear…and something I shouldn’t be feeling.
My eyes snapped open just a sliver, my body instinctively remaining still. What I saw made my blood turn to ice in my veins.
Caelum—my mate, my Alpha, my husband of three years—was moving above a figure with cascading chestnut curls. His powerful frame blocked most of my view, but I could see enough. The way his muscles rippled with each thrust. The way his head was thrown back in pure, animalistic pleasure. The way his hands gripped the woman's hips with a desperation I'd never seen directed at me.
""God, Marise,"" he growled, his voice thick with lust. ""You feel so fu*king perfect.""
Marise. My best friend. The woman who had held my hand through countless lonely nights when Caelum was away on campaigns. Who had assured me that his coldness was just the burden of leadership weighing on him.
""Harder, Caelum,"" she panted, her voice breathy and wanton. ""I want to feel you for days.""
I bit down on my tongue so hard I tasted copper, fighting to keep my breathing steady and shallow. My heart hammered against my ribs like a caged animal, but I couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. Couldn't process what I was seeing.
A few hours ago, I collapsed from overusing my healing ability.A warrior brought me home; Caelum looked worried, and Marise even gave me warm milk to help me rest.They were the two people I trusted most.
But when I drifted awake, I thought I was trapped in a nightmare—because right beside my unconscious body,they were having sex!
This was my bed. Our bed. The one where Caelum would lie rigid beside me after our perfunctory matings, where he'd immediately retreat to the bathroom afterward as if he couldn't stand the scent of me on his skin.
""Shh,"" Caelum chuckled darkly, his pace never faltering. ""You'll wake up our little healer.""
Our little healer. The casual dismissal in his tone hit me like a physical blow.
Marise's laugh was breathless and cruel. ""Maybe that would make this even more exciting."" Her hair whipped around as she moved, and I felt the silky strands brush against my face like a mockery. ""Besides, she's so exhausted from playing nursemaid to your warriors, she won't wake up for hours.""
""Mmm, you're probably right."" Caelum's voice dropped to that intimate rumble I'd once thought was reserved for me alone. ""She drained herself completely today. Stupid little omega, always pushing herself to the breaking point.""
My fingernails dug crescents into my palms as I fought to remain motionless. The casual cruelty in his words was worse than any physical pain I'd ever endured.
""That's what makes her so useful,"" Marise gasped between moans. ""She'll heal anyone you put in front of her, no questions asked. The perfect little tool.""
""Exactly."" Caelum's rhythm grew more urgent, more primal. ""But when it comes to choosing a real Luna, someone worthy of standing beside an Alpha... well, that requires a different kind of woman entirely.""
The words shattered something deep inside my chest. Three years. Three years of believing I was building something real with him. Three years of thinking his distance was just his way of protecting himself from the vulnerability of the mate bond.
""Someone like me?"" Marise's voice was coy, teasing.
""Someone exactly like you,"" he confirmed, and I could hear the smile in his voice. ""Beautiful, strong, from a good family. Not some weak omega who can barely stand after a day's work.""
I squeezed my eyes shut, but the tears leaked out anyway, hot and silent against my cheeks. How many times had they done this? How many nights had I lain alone in this very bed while they were together somewhere else? How many concerned looks and comforting words from Marise had been lies?
The bed shook more violently now, their movements becoming frantic and desperate. I could feel the heat radiating from their bodies, could smell the musk of their arousal mixing with the lingering scent of my own exhaustion.
Suddenly Marise's weight was pressing down on me as she straddled my supposedly unconscious form. Her hair fell like a curtain around us, and I could feel her skin, slick with sweat, brushing against mine.
The violation of it—the sheer audacity—broke the last of my restraint.
I shoved her off me with a strength I didn't know I possessed, my wolf lending me power even in my weakened state. Marise tumbled to the side with a startled shriek as I rolled toward the edge of the bed, my stomach heaving.
The taste of bile filled my mouth as I retched over the side of the mattress, my body rejecting everything—the betrayal, the lies, the three years of my life I'd wasted believing in a love that had never existed.
""Elowen!"" Caelum's voice was sharp with shock, but I couldn't look at him. Couldn't bear to see his face.
I heaved again, my empty stomach clenching painfully as tears streamed down my face. The room spun around me, and I gripped the edge of the mattress to keep from collapsing entirely.
Time seemed to stand still for a moment.
Soon, however, Marise recovered with an almost predatory grace that made my stomach lurch all over again.
She didn't rush to cover herself. Instead, she stretched languidly, like a cat basking in sunlight, her perfect curves on full display as she reached for her discarded clothes with deliberate slowness. The scent of their coupling hung heavy in the air—musky, intimate, wrong—and I had to press my hand over my mouth to keep from retching again.
""Well,"" Marise purred, her voice honey-sweet with false concern, ""look who's finally awake."" She pulled her silk blouse over her head, but not before running her fingers along the dark bruises blooming across her collarbone—marks that should have been mine, would never be mine. ""I do hope we didn't disturb your rest, Elowen. You looked so... peaceful.""
The mockery in her tone was like acid on an open wound. She knew exactly what she was doing, displaying those love bites like trophies, each one a deliberate slap to my face. My hands trembled as I gripped the edge of the bed, trying to find my voice, trying to find any words that could express the devastation tearing through my chest.
""How could you?"" The words came out as barely a whisper, broken and raw. ""Caelum, how could you do this to me? To us?""
His face twisted, the shock melting away into something ugly and defensive. ""Don't you dare take that tone with me,"" he snarled, yanking on his pants with sharp, angry movements. ""You have no right to question what I do.""
""No right?"" My voice cracked, disbelief flooding through me. ""I'm your mate! Your Luna! I've given you everything—""
""Everything?"" Caelum's laugh was harsh, cutting through me like broken glass. ""You call that cold, lifeless body of yours everything? You lie there like a corpse every time I touch you. No passion, no fire, nothing but duty and obligation.""
Each word hit me like a physical blow, but I forced myself to stand, my legs shaking beneath me. ""That's not true. I love you, I've always—""
""Love?"" He spat the word like it tasted bitter. ""You don't know the first thing about love, about what a real woman can offer a man."" His eyes flicked to Marise, who was now perched on the edge of the dresser, watching our confrontation with barely concealed glee. ""Marise understands what an Alpha needs. She knows how to make me feel like the powerful man I am, not some... caretaker for a broken little Omega.""
The venom in his voice when he said 'Omega' made me flinch. After three years, I thought I'd grown used to the subtle disdain, the way he sometimes looked at me like I was something distasteful he had to endure. But hearing it spoken so plainly, with such disgust...
""If it weren't for this damned mate bond,"" he continued, his green eyes cold as winter frost, ""I never would have chosen someone like you. A low-born Omega with nothing to offer but a useful little healing trick. You should be grateful I kept you around at all.""
My hand moved instinctively to my stomach, pressing against the barely-there curve hidden beneath my nightgown. Two months. I'd been carrying his child for two months, dreaming of the moment I could tell him, imagining his joy, his pride. The irony was so bitter I could taste it on my tongue.
Three years ago, I thought, remembering our mating night with crystal clarity. I'd waited for him in our bed, wearing the white silk nightgown I'd saved for months to buy, my heart racing with anticipation and love. He never came home. I'd fallen asleep alone, and when I woke the next morning, Marise had sent me a message full of false sympathy: ""Oh honey, maybe he just needed some air? You know how overwhelming the mate bond can be for Alphas!""
How long had they been laughing at me? How many nights had they spent together while I waited, hoping, believing his excuses about pack business and late meetings?
""I want to leave,"" I whispered, the words scraping against my throat like sandpaper. ""I can't... I won't stay here and watch this.""
Caelum's expression shifted, a calculating gleam entering his eyes that I'd seen before—usually when he was planning his next territorial expansion. ""Leave? Oh, I don't think so, little healer.""
Before I could react, he was at the door, his voice carrying the Alpha command that made my wolf whimper and submit against my will. ""Guards!""
Two of his warriors appeared instantly, their faces carefully blank as they took in the scene—me in my nightgown, tears streaming down my face, the obvious aftermath of betrayal hanging in the air like smoke.
""Escort Luna Elowen to the east wing,"" Caelum ordered, his tone businesslike and cold. ""She's to remain there under supervision until further notice.""
""What?"" Panic flared in my chest. ""Caelum, you can't—""
""I can do whatever I want,"" he cut me off, straightening his shoulders in that way that made him look every inch the commanding Alpha he believed himself to be. ""Especially when you still have uses.""
The word 'uses' made my blood run cold. ""What do you mean?""
A smile curved his lips, but there was nothing warm about it. ""We're expecting a very important visitor in the coming days. The Alpha of the Nighthelm Pack—Darius himself. I'm sure you've heard the stories about him. Dark, dangerous, powerful beyond measure."" His eyes glittered with greed. ""His territory is ten times the size of ours, and his pack's strength is legendary.""
My heart began to race for entirely different reasons. Everyone knew about Darius—the shadow Alpha who ruled the northern territories with an iron fist, whose very name was whispered in equal parts fear and awe.
""He's heard rumors about our little healer,"" Caelum continued, circling me like a predator. ""Apparently, he has some old injuries that conventional medicine can't touch. He's coming here specifically to see if your... talents... might be of use to him.""
The implications hit me like a sledgehammer. ""You're going to trade me.""
""I'm going to make a deal that benefits this pack,"" he corrected smoothly. ""Your healing abilities could secure us an alliance that would make us the most powerful pack in the region. You should be honored to serve such an important purpose.""
Marise laughed, a tinkling sound that grated against my nerves. ""Oh, Elowen, don't look so tragic. Think of it as finally finding your true calling. You were never really cut out to be a Luna anyway.""
The guards stepped forward, and I knew there was no point in fighting. My wolf was too weak, too submissive to challenge an Alpha's direct command. But as they flanked me, preparing to escort me to what was essentially a prison, I felt something shift inside me—a tiny flutter of movement that reminded me of the precious secret I carried.
""This isn't over,"" I whispered, meeting Caelum's eyes with what little defiance I could muster.
He laughed, the sound echoing off the walls of what had once been our sanctuary. ""Oh, little Omega, it's been over for a very long time. You just never realized it.""
As the guards led me away, I caught one last glimpse of Marise settling back into the bed that had been mine, her satisfied smile the final nail in the coffin of everything I'd believed about my life. The door closed behind me with a soft click that sounded like the end of the world.
But as I walked down the hallway toward my gilded cage, my hand never left my stomach, never stopped protecting the one thing they didn't know about—the one secret that was still mine alone.
The morning light felt like a mockery against my skin as the guards flanked me once again, their heavy footsteps echoing mine as we made our way to the medical tent. Three weeks had passed since that night—three weeks of this suffocating routine that had become my prison.
""Move faster, Luna,"" one of them grunted, his tone devoid of any respect the title should have commanded.
Luna. The word tasted bitter now, like ash in my mouth.
The wounded warriors lay before me in neat rows, their pain radiating through the bond I shared with our pack. My wolf stirred restlessly in my chest, always eager to heal, always willing to give more than I had. She didn't understand the cost—or perhaps she did, and simply loved too deeply to care.
""Please,"" whispered a young warrior, his leg mangled from a border skirmish. ""The pain... it's driving me mad.""
I knelt beside him, placing my hands on his fevered skin. The familiar warmth flowed from me, golden threads of healing energy that soothed not just his wounds but the wild desperation in his wolf's eyes. One by one, I moved through the tent, each healing taking a piece of my strength, each grateful look from a warrior adding another weight to my shoulders.
By the time the sun reached its peak, my hands trembled with exhaustion. The guards were already growing impatient, checking their watches and muttering about schedules.
""That's enough for today,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.
""Alpha's orders were clear,"" the larger guard replied. ""Every wounded warrior gets treatment.""
""I can barely stand—""
""Then sit. But you're not leaving until they're all healed.""
The afternoon bled into evening. When we finally returned to the packhouse, my legs could barely carry me up the front steps. The familiar scent hit me before I even opened the door—musk and arousal, thick and cloying in the air.
My stomach lurched.
Clothes were scattered across the living room like discarded promises. Caelum's shirt hung from the banister, Marise's lace underwear draped over the coffee table like a flag of conquest. The carpet beneath my feet felt damp, and I didn't want to think about why.
""Oh, you're back!"" Marise's voice rang out from the kitchen, sickeningly sweet. She appeared in the doorway wearing nothing but Caelum's button-down shirt, her perfect curls cascading over her shoulders. ""Perfect timing. We're absolutely starving.""
I stared at her, my wolf whimpering in my chest like a wounded animal.
""I was thinking pasta tonight,"" she continued, examining her manicured nails. ""Something with cream sauce. You know how Caelum loves it when things are... rich and satisfying.""
The innuendo wasn't lost on me. Nothing ever was with Marise.
""I need to rest,"" I managed, my voice cracking.
""Rest?"" She laughed, the sound like breaking glass. ""Sweetie, you're the Luna. This is your job. Besides, you look fine to me.""
Fine. I caught my reflection in the hallway mirror—hollow cheeks, dark circles under my eyes, my once-lustrous hair now dull and brittle at the ends. I looked like a ghost of myself.
""The living room needs cleaning too,"" Marise added, gesturing at the mess they'd made. ""And tomorrow I'll need you to pick up a few things from town. I'll make you a list.""
""What kind of things?""
Her smile turned predatory. ""Oh, just some items to help keep Caelum... interested. You understand, don't you? A woman has to work to keep her man satisfied.""
My wolf snarled, a sound that escaped my throat before I could stop it.
""Careful,"" Marise purred, stepping closer. ""That almost sounded like jealousy. But we both know you're much too good for such petty emotions, aren't you, Elowen?""
The days blurred together after that. Healing in the morning, returning to their aftermath in the evening. Cooking their meals while they disappeared upstairs, the sounds of their passion echoing through the house like torture. Cleaning up their messes, washing their sheets, pretending not to see the way Marise watched me with those cold blue eyes, drinking in my humiliation like fine wine.
Each night, I curled up in the guest room—my own bedroom now forbidden to me—and pressed my hand to my still-flat stomach. Two months along, and my secret felt like the only thing keeping me sane.
Soon, I whispered to the life growing inside me. Soon we'll find a way out of this.
But each day made that promise feel more like a lie.
Tonight was no different. I dragged myself through the front door, my healing energy completely depleted, my wolf barely a whisper in my consciousness. The living room was worse than usual—cushions thrown everywhere, wine stains on the white carpet, the air thick with their scent.
I needed a shower. I needed to wash away the day, the pain, the constant reminder of what my life had become.
The bathroom door was slightly ajar, steam escaping from within. I pushed it open, desperate for the sanctuary of hot water and solitude.
""Where do you think you're going?""
Caelum's voice stopped me cold. He stood in the doorway behind me, his green eyes hard as emeralds, his nostrils flaring.
""I... I just wanted to shower,"" I stammered.
""Not yet."" His hand shot out, gripping my arm with bruising force. ""Come here.""
He dragged me back into the living room where Marise sat curled on the couch, wearing a silk robe that barely covered her thighs. Her lips curved in anticipation, like she was about to watch her favorite show.
""You smell wrong,"" Caelum said, his voice low and dangerous. ""Different.""
My heart hammered against my ribs. ""I don't know what you mean.""
""Don't lie to me."" His hands were on me then, roughly patting down my clothes, searching for something I didn't understand. His nose pressed against my neck, inhaling deeply, and I felt his body tense.
""You have several other scents on you,"" he growled. ""Male.""
""No, that's because of the treatment—""
""Is it?"" Marise's voice cut through the air like a blade. ""Maybe our little Luna isn't as innocent as she pretends. Maybe she likes being touched by other men.""
""No!"" The word tore from my throat. ""I would never—""
But Caelum wasn't listening. His grip tightened on my hair, fingers tangling in the silver-gold strands as he yanked my head back. Pain shot through my scalp, bringing tears to my eyes.
""You think I'm stupid?"" he snarled. ""Are you so thirsty that you seduce other males?""
""Caelum, please—""
""Who was it?"" His face was inches from mine now, his breath hot against my skin. ""Which one of those warriors couldn't keep his hands to himself?""
The healing. He was smelling the healing. The close contact, the shared energy—it must have left traces of their scent on my skin. But how could I explain that? How could I make him understand when he'd already decided I was guilty?
""Maybe she's been enjoying her little trips to the medical tent a bit too much,"" Marise suggested, her voice dripping with false concern. ""All those grateful, wounded men... it must be quite the power trip.""
""Stop,"" I whispered, but my voice was lost in Caelum's rage.
His hand fisted tighter in my hair, and suddenly I was moving, being dragged across the room. My feet scrambled for purchase on the hardwood floor as he hauled me toward the back door.
""If you want to act like a whore,"" he spat, ""then you can be cleaned like one.""
The night air hit my skin like a slap as he threw open the door and dragged me into the yard. The garden hose lay coiled by the side of the house, attached to the high-pressure nozzle he used to wash his car.
Understanding dawned on me like ice water in my veins.
""Caelum, no—""
But he was already reaching for the nozzle, his movements sharp and violent. Behind us, I could hear Marise's delighted laughter floating through the open door.
""This should wash off whatever filth you've been rolling in,"" he said, his voice cold as winter.
The first blast of water hit me like a physical blow, the pressure so intense it knocked me off my feet. I hit the ground hard, my knees scraping against the concrete as the icy stream followed me down.
""Please!"" I gasped, trying to shield my face with my arms. ""Please stop!""
But he didn't stop. The water pounded against my body like liquid hammers, each impact sending shockwaves of pain through my bones. My clothes plastered against my skin, then began to tear under the relentless pressure.
I tried to stand, to run, but my feet slipped on the wet concrete and I went down again. The nozzle followed me, merciless, the water cutting into my skin like tiny knives.
""Caelum!"" I screamed, my voice breaking. ""I'm pregnant!""
But my words were lost in the roar of water and his rage. Dark bruises bloomed across my arms and legs where the pressure was strongest. Thin lines of blood began to seep through the tears in my skin, mixing with the water and running pink down the drain.
My wolf was howling now, a sound of pure anguish that echoed in my chest. She was in agony—not just from the physical pain, but from the betrayal, the rejection, the complete destruction of everything we'd believed about our mate.
""Stop… please, I—I can't take this anymore.""I sobbed, curling into myself on the floor.""Please… reject me. Don't torture me like this.""
Something in my voice must have finally reached him, because the water stopped. I lay there gasping, shivering, my body a map of bruises and cuts. Every breath was agony, every movement sent fresh waves of pain through my battered form.
The water gun clattered to the ground with a hollow metallic sound that echoed in my ears like a death knell. But Caelum wasn't finished with me. His eyes held that familiar cold calculation as he grabbed my arm, his grip bruising.
""You think that's enough?"" His voice was low, dangerous. ""You think you can just wash away whatever you've been doing behind my back?""
Before I could protest, before I could even breathe, his canines extended. The sharp points gleamed in the harsh afternoon light as he yanked my head to the side, exposing the tender skin of my neck where his original mark lay faded and scarred from years of neglect.
""No, please—"" The words barely escaped my lips before he bit down, hard and merciless.
The pain was excruciating, but it was nothing compared to the agony that followed. Through the forced bond, I felt everything—his disgust, his possessiveness, his complete and utter indifference to my suffering. But worse, so much worse, was what came next.
Images flooded my mind through our connection. Caelum with Marise, their bodies intertwined in ways that should have been sacred between mates. I saw every touch, felt every sensation as if it were happening to me. The betrayal cut deeper than any physical wound ever could.
""Feel that,"" he growled against my neck, his voice muffled by blood—my blood. ""Feel what a real woman can give me. What you never could.""
My legs gave out, but he held me upright, forcing me to experience every moment of his infidelity through the bond he'd just strengthened. Marise's laughter rang in my ears, both from memory and from where she stood watching us now, her eyes bright with cruel satisfaction.
""Oh, this is perfect,"" she purred, clapping her hands together like a delighted child. ""She can feel everything now, can't she? Every time you touch me, every time you—""
""Stop,"" I whispered, but the word came out broken, barely audible.
Caelum released my neck, letting me collapse to the muddy ground. Blood trickled down my shoulder, mixing with the water that still dripped from my hair. ""Now you'll always know,"" he said, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. ""You'll always feel exactly what you mean to me.""
The days that followed blurred together in a haze of numbness and pain. I moved through the healing tents like a ghost, my hands working automatically while my mind retreated somewhere far away. The deeper mark on my neck throbbed constantly, a reminder of my place in this pack—not as Luna, but as a tool to be used and discarded.
""Elowen, we need you in tent three,"" someone called out, but their voice sounded distant, underwater.
I nodded mechanically, wiping my hands on a bloodstained cloth before moving to the next patient. A young warrior lay writhing on the cot, his leg mangled from a border skirmish. The sight should have moved me to immediate action, but I felt nothing. Even my wolf had retreated so deep inside me that I could barely sense her presence.
I placed my hands on the warrior's leg, letting what remained of my healing energy flow into him. The familiar drain pulled at my core, but I welcomed it. Physical exhaustion was easier to bear than the emotional devastation that threatened to consume me whenever I stopped moving.
""You're slower today,"" the warrior complained, his face twisted in pain. ""The others said you used to be faster.""
I didn't respond. What was there to say? That every time I used my abilities now, I felt Caelum's contempt through our bond? That healing others had become a form of self-torture?
""Elowen!"" Another voice, sharper this time. ""We have three more coming in from the eastern border. Move faster.""
I finished with the warrior and stumbled to the next tent, my vision blurring at the edges. When had I last eaten? When had I last slept? The days had become an endless cycle of healing, cleaning, and trying to ignore the constant stream of images Caelum seemed to delight in sending through our bond.
In tent five, I found myself cleaning vomit from a fevering wolf's chin while he thrashed in delirium. The acidic smell made my empty stomach clench, but I forced myself to continue. Someone thrust a bowl of cold soup into my hands.
""Eat while you work,"" they ordered. ""We can't afford for you to collapse.""
I spooned the tasteless broth into my mouth while holding down the patient's convulsing arm with my other hand. The irony wasn't lost on me—they needed me functional, but they couldn't spare five minutes for me to eat in peace.
""Could you hurry up?"" A beta warrior stood in the tent opening, his arms crossed impatiently. ""We've got wounded piling up outside, and you're in here having lunch.""
""I'm—"" I started to explain, but he'd already turned away.
""Always something with omegas,"" I heard him mutter to his companion. ""Give them the smallest responsibility and they think they deserve special treatment.""
The words hit me like physical blows. After everything I'd sacrificed, everything I'd given to this pack, they still saw me as nothing more than my designation. Not their Luna. Not even a person. Just an omega who should be grateful for the chance to serve.
I set down the soup, my appetite completely gone, and moved to the next patient. My hands shook as I worked, whether from exhaustion or emotion, I couldn't tell anymore.
""The healing tent always smells like omega now,"" someone complained from outside. ""It's distracting.""
""Maybe if she didn't spend so much time in there,"" another voice replied with a laugh. ""Though I guess that's all she's good for.""
The casual cruelty in their voices made my chest tighten. These were wolves I'd healed, wolves whose lives I'd saved countless times. But to them, I would always be lesser. Always be other.
I stumbled out of the tent, gasping for air that didn't seem to fill my lungs. The camp bustled around me, wolves going about their duties without sparing me a glance. I was invisible to them unless they needed something from me.
I don't belong here, the thought whispered through my mind like a revelation. I never belonged here.
For three years, I'd tried to prove myself worthy of being Caelum's mate, worthy of being this pack's Luna. But the truth was staring me in the face—I was nothing more than a convenient tool. A healing machine that happened to share their Alpha's bed.
The realization should have broken me, but instead, it felt almost liberating. If I didn't belong here, then maybe... maybe I could belong somewhere else.
That evening, while the pack celebrated another successful raid, I slipped away from the camp. No one noticed my absence—they were too busy drinking and boasting about their victories. Victories built on the backs of the wolves I'd healed, the lives I'd saved so they could fight another day.
I walked until I reached the border, where the familiar territory gave way to wild, unclaimed land. The moon hung low and full above me, casting everything in silver light. For the first time in months, I felt like I could breathe.
The wind carried scents from beyond our territory—pine and earth and something wild and free that called to the wolf still hiding deep inside me. I closed my eyes and let myself imagine what it would be like to just... keep walking. To leave behind the pain and humiliation and constant, grinding exhaustion.
What would it feel like to be free?
The thought was so seductive, so tempting, that I took another step forward. Then another. The border markers fell behind me as I walked into the unknown, my bare feet silent on the forest floor.
Maybe this was the answer. Maybe this was how I could finally escape the nightmare my life had become. The pack wouldn't miss me—not really. They'd miss my healing abilities, but they'd find another way to manage. They always did.
I reached the edge of a cliff that overlooked a vast valley, the moonlight turning the landscape into something ethereal and beautiful. Below, a river wound through the darkness like a silver ribbon. It would be so easy to just... let go. To finally stop fighting a battle I could never win.
I closed my eyes and took another step forward, feeling the ground crumble slightly under my feet. The wind whipped my hair around my face, and for a moment, I felt weightless.
Then strong arms wrapped around my waist, pulling me back from the edge with such force that we both stumbled backward. I gasped, my eyes flying open as I found myself pressed against a broad chest, surrounded by a scent that made my wolf stir for the first time in weeks.
""Easy,"" a deep voice rumbled above me, rich and warm like honey over gravel. ""You're safe.""
I tilted my head back and found myself staring into eyes the color of storm clouds—deep gray with flecks of silver that seemed to glow in the moonlight. His face was all sharp angles and strong lines, framed by dark hair that looked like he'd been running his fingers through it. He was tall, so tall that I had to crane my neck to meet his gaze, and something about his presence made me feel small and protected rather than diminished.
The moment our eyes met, the world seemed to shift on its axis. A jolt of electricity shot through me where his hands touched my waist, spreading outward until every nerve ending in my body was singing. My wolf, who had been silent for so long, suddenly lifted her head and howled with recognition.

I don’t know how to process this.","Hi everyone. I’m a f26, and I need some outside perspective because I feel emotionally overwhelmed and unsure if I’m overreacting. 

Yesterday, I invited my parents over for breakfast. Everything was calm and cozy in the beginning, we were talking about my recent trip to Bali, and I mentioned how kind and grateful the people there are, even though they don’t have much. My mom asked if we helped anyone financially, and I said we helped where we could.

Out of nowhere she shifted the whole conversation and told me that I never help her. She said I only think about myself, that I never help her financially, and brought up an example about a time I bought her some underwear she asked me for. She said that because I told her the price and she transferred me the money, I should have refused the payment and just given them to her. She basically said I should have shown “more humility,” whatever that means.

The whole atmosphere changed instantly. I got quiet because it hurt and confused me, it felt so unfair and unprovoked. She could see I was upset, and instead of calming down, she got angry that I was still sad about it after 5 minutes. She didn’t drink her coffee and basically stormed out the door, leaving me shocked and feeling small, guilty, and sick inside.

This kind of behavior from her isn’t new. I grew up with this. Suddenly turning on me, humiliating me, getting angry if I show emotions, making everything my fault. I’ve always had a more secure and calm relationship with my dad, so I was also sad that he just left with her because I had been looking forward to seeing him.

I called her many times and she didn’t pick up. She had a habit of “punishment” when she gets angry. Today, I called her again because I wanted to repair things. I didn’t blame her - I just apologized because I didn’t want the tension. The moment she picked up, she started scolding me again. She said I “kicked her out” yesterday because, in her mind, I should have stopped her from leaving. She expected me to physically stop her or beg her to stay. I froze yesterday because I went into shock, but she didn’t care, i tried to tell her my version but she didn’t care. She called me many bad names and kept going. 

While she was yelling today, I started having a panic attack. I couldn’t breathe, I was shaking, crying, saying “I’m sorry” over and over just to make her stop. She didn’t stop. Even after my panic attack, she kept scolding me. In the end we hang up. She has never seen me have a panic attack before - she doesn’t know I have anxiety. 

Now I’m left feeling emotionally drained, shaky, guilty, sad, and honestly a bit traumatized. My body feels like I’m still in that fear-state. I know this isn’t normal behavior, but I don’t know how to fully process it because this is how she has always been with me since childhood. I work as a social worker, because I don’t want children to grow up like I did. Now i’m even thinking of taking a sick day because i’m scared that this + work stress will end it a long term sick leave. 

I don’t want to cut her off, but I also don’t know how to keep myself safe emotionally when she behaves like this.

How do I deal with a mother who reacts like a child, punishes with guilt, rewrites reality, and doesn’t stop even when I’m having an actual panic attack?
And how do I calm my body after something like this?",21,1764707615.0,raisedbynarcissists,10,0.97,False

The bed shook violently beneath me, creaking unbearably. Moans—sharp, sultry, not mine—grew louder. A sudden, familiar low growl exploded in my ear. I rolled toward the sound, heart hammering, pulse racing, a mix of fear…and something I shouldn’t be feeling.
My eyes snapped open just a sliver, my body instinctively remaining still. What I saw made my blood turn to ice in my veins.
Caelum—my mate, my Alpha, my husband of three years—was moving above a figure with cascading chestnut curls. His powerful frame blocked most of my view, but I could see enough. The way his muscles rippled with each thrust. The way his head was thrown back in pure, animalistic pleasure. The way his hands gripped the woman's hips with a desperation I'd never seen directed at me.
""God, Marise,"" he growled, his voice thick with lust. ""You feel so fu*king perfect.""
Marise. My best friend. The woman who had held my hand through countless lonely nights when Caelum was away on campaigns. Who had assured me that his coldness was just the burden of leadership weighing on him.
""Harder, Caelum,"" she panted, her voice breathy and wanton. ""I want to feel you for days.""
I bit down on my tongue so hard I tasted copper, fighting to keep my breathing steady and shallow. My heart hammered against my ribs like a caged animal, but I couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. Couldn't process what I was seeing.
A few hours ago, I collapsed from overusing my healing ability.A warrior brought me home; Caelum looked worried, and Marise even gave me warm milk to help me rest.They were the two people I trusted most.
But when I drifted awake, I thought I was trapped in a nightmare—because right beside my unconscious body,they were having sex!
This was my bed. Our bed. The one where Caelum would lie rigid beside me after our perfunctory matings, where he'd immediately retreat to the bathroom afterward as if he couldn't stand the scent of me on his skin.
""Shh,"" Caelum chuckled darkly, his pace never faltering. ""You'll wake up our little healer.""
Our little healer. The casual dismissal in his tone hit me like a physical blow.
Marise's laugh was breathless and cruel. ""Maybe that would make this even more exciting."" Her hair whipped around as she moved, and I felt the silky strands brush against my face like a mockery. ""Besides, she's so exhausted from playing nursemaid to your warriors, she won't wake up for hours.""
""Mmm, you're probably right."" Caelum's voice dropped to that intimate rumble I'd once thought was reserved for me alone. ""She drained herself completely today. Stupid little omega, always pushing herself to the breaking point.""
My fingernails dug crescents into my palms as I fought to remain motionless. The casual cruelty in his words was worse than any physical pain I'd ever endured.
""That's what makes her so useful,"" Marise gasped between moans. ""She'll heal anyone you put in front of her, no questions asked. The perfect little tool.""
""Exactly."" Caelum's rhythm grew more urgent, more primal. ""But when it comes to choosing a real Luna, someone worthy of standing beside an Alpha... well, that requires a different kind of woman entirely.""
The words shattered something deep inside my chest. Three years. Three years of believing I was building something real with him. Three years of thinking his distance was just his way of protecting himself from the vulnerability of the mate bond.
""Someone like me?"" Marise's voice was coy, teasing.
""Someone exactly like you,"" he confirmed, and I could hear the smile in his voice. ""Beautiful, strong, from a good family. Not some weak omega who can barely stand after a day's work.""
I squeezed my eyes shut, but the tears leaked out anyway, hot and silent against my cheeks. How many times had they done this? How many nights had I lain alone in this very bed while they were together somewhere else? How many concerned looks and comforting words from Marise had been lies?
The bed shook more violently now, their movements becoming frantic and desperate. I could feel the heat radiating from their bodies, could smell the musk of their arousal mixing with the lingering scent of my own exhaustion.
Suddenly Marise's weight was pressing down on me as she straddled my supposedly unconscious form. Her hair fell like a curtain around us, and I could feel her skin, slick with sweat, brushing against mine.
The violation of it—the sheer audacity—broke the last of my restraint.
I shoved her off me with a strength I didn't know I possessed, my wolf lending me power even in my weakened state. Marise tumbled to the side with a startled shriek as I rolled toward the edge of the bed, my stomach heaving.
The taste of bile filled my mouth as I retched over the side of the mattress, my body rejecting everything—the betrayal, the lies, the three years of my life I'd wasted believing in a love that had never existed.
""Elowen!"" Caelum's voice was sharp with shock, but I couldn't look at him. Couldn't bear to see his face.
I heaved again, my empty stomach clenching painfully as tears streamed down my face. The room spun around me, and I gripped the edge of the mattress to keep from collapsing entirely.
Time seemed to stand still for a moment.
Soon, however, Marise recovered with an almost predatory grace that made my stomach lurch all over again.
She didn't rush to cover herself. Instead, she stretched languidly, like a cat basking in sunlight, her perfect curves on full display as she reached for her discarded clothes with deliberate slowness. The scent of their coupling hung heavy in the air—musky, intimate, wrong—and I had to press my hand over my mouth to keep from retching again.
""Well,"" Marise purred, her voice honey-sweet with false concern, ""look who's finally awake."" She pulled her silk blouse over her head, but not before running her fingers along the dark bruises blooming across her collarbone—marks that should have been mine, would never be mine. ""I do hope we didn't disturb your rest, Elowen. You looked so... peaceful.""
The mockery in her tone was like acid on an open wound. She knew exactly what she was doing, displaying those love bites like trophies, each one a deliberate slap to my face. My hands trembled as I gripped the edge of the bed, trying to find my voice, trying to find any words that could express the devastation tearing through my chest.
""How could you?"" The words came out as barely a whisper, broken and raw. ""Caelum, how could you do this to me? To us?""
His face twisted, the shock melting away into something ugly and defensive. ""Don't you dare take that tone with me,"" he snarled, yanking on his pants with sharp, angry movements. ""You have no right to question what I do.""
""No right?"" My voice cracked, disbelief flooding through me. ""I'm your mate! Your Luna! I've given you everything—""
""Everything?"" Caelum's laugh was harsh, cutting through me like broken glass. ""You call that cold, lifeless body of yours everything? You lie there like a corpse every time I touch you. No passion, no fire, nothing but duty and obligation.""
Each word hit me like a physical blow, but I forced myself to stand, my legs shaking beneath me. ""That's not true. I love you, I've always—""
""Love?"" He spat the word like it tasted bitter. ""You don't know the first thing about love, about what a real woman can offer a man."" His eyes flicked to Marise, who was now perched on the edge of the dresser, watching our confrontation with barely concealed glee. ""Marise understands what an Alpha needs. She knows how to make me feel like the powerful man I am, not some... caretaker for a broken little Omega.""
The venom in his voice when he said 'Omega' made me flinch. After three years, I thought I'd grown used to the subtle disdain, the way he sometimes looked at me like I was something distasteful he had to endure. But hearing it spoken so plainly, with such disgust...
""If it weren't for this damned mate bond,"" he continued, his green eyes cold as winter frost, ""I never would have chosen someone like you. A low-born Omega with nothing to offer but a useful little healing trick. You should be grateful I kept you around at all.""
My hand moved instinctively to my stomach, pressing against the barely-there curve hidden beneath my nightgown. Two months. I'd been carrying his child for two months, dreaming of the moment I could tell him, imagining his joy, his pride. The irony was so bitter I could taste it on my tongue.
Three years ago, I thought, remembering our mating night with crystal clarity. I'd waited for him in our bed, wearing the white silk nightgown I'd saved for months to buy, my heart racing with anticipation and love. He never came home. I'd fallen asleep alone, and when I woke the next morning, Marise had sent me a message full of false sympathy: ""Oh honey, maybe he just needed some air? You know how overwhelming the mate bond can be for Alphas!""
How long had they been laughing at me? How many nights had they spent together while I waited, hoping, believing his excuses about pack business and late meetings?
""I want to leave,"" I whispered, the words scraping against my throat like sandpaper. ""I can't... I won't stay here and watch this.""
Caelum's expression shifted, a calculating gleam entering his eyes that I'd seen before—usually when he was planning his next territorial expansion. ""Leave? Oh, I don't think so, little healer.""
Before I could react, he was at the door, his voice carrying the Alpha command that made my wolf whimper and submit against my will. ""Guards!""
Two of his warriors appeared instantly, their faces carefully blank as they took in the scene—me in my nightgown, tears streaming down my face, the obvious aftermath of betrayal hanging in the air like smoke.
""Escort Luna Elowen to the east wing,"" Caelum ordered, his tone businesslike and cold. ""She's to remain there under supervision until further notice.""
""What?"" Panic flared in my chest. ""Caelum, you can't—""
""I can do whatever I want,"" he cut me off, straightening his shoulders in that way that made him look every inch the commanding Alpha he believed himself to be. ""Especially when you still have uses.""
The word 'uses' made my blood run cold. ""What do you mean?""
A smile curved his lips, but there was nothing warm about it. ""We're expecting a very important visitor in the coming days. The Alpha of the Nighthelm Pack—Darius himself. I'm sure you've heard the stories about him. Dark, dangerous, powerful beyond measure."" His eyes glittered with greed. ""His territory is ten times the size of ours, and his pack's strength is legendary.""
My heart began to race for entirely different reasons. Everyone knew about Darius—the shadow Alpha who ruled the northern territories with an iron fist, whose very name was whispered in equal parts fear and awe.
""He's heard rumors about our little healer,"" Caelum continued, circling me like a predator. ""Apparently, he has some old injuries that conventional medicine can't touch. He's coming here specifically to see if your... talents... might be of use to him.""
The implications hit me like a sledgehammer. ""You're going to trade me.""
""I'm going to make a deal that benefits this pack,"" he corrected smoothly. ""Your healing abilities could secure us an alliance that would make us the most powerful pack in the region. You should be honored to serve such an important purpose.""
Marise laughed, a tinkling sound that grated against my nerves. ""Oh, Elowen, don't look so tragic. Think of it as finally finding your true calling. You were never really cut out to be a Luna anyway.""
The guards stepped forward, and I knew there was no point in fighting. My wolf was too weak, too submissive to challenge an Alpha's direct command. But as they flanked me, preparing to escort me to what was essentially a prison, I felt something shift inside me—a tiny flutter of movement that reminded me of the precious secret I carried.
""This isn't over,"" I whispered, meeting Caelum's eyes with what little defiance I could muster.
He laughed, the sound echoing off the walls of what had once been our sanctuary. ""Oh, little Omega, it's been over for a very long time. You just never realized it.""
As the guards led me away, I caught one last glimpse of Marise settling back into the bed that had been mine, her satisfied smile the final nail in the coffin of everything I'd believed about my life. The door closed behind me with a soft click that sounded like the end of the world.
But as I walked down the hallway toward my gilded cage, my hand never left my stomach, never stopped protecting the one thing they didn't know about—the one secret that was still mine alone.
The morning light felt like a mockery against my skin as the guards flanked me once again, their heavy footsteps echoing mine as we made our way to the medical tent. Three weeks had passed since that night—three weeks of this suffocating routine that had become my prison.
""Move faster, Luna,"" one of them grunted, his tone devoid of any respect the title should have commanded.
Luna. The word tasted bitter now, like ash in my mouth.
The wounded warriors lay before me in neat rows, their pain radiating through the bond I shared with our pack. My wolf stirred restlessly in my chest, always eager to heal, always willing to give more than I had. She didn't understand the cost—or perhaps she did, and simply loved too deeply to care.
""Please,"" whispered a young warrior, his leg mangled from a border skirmish. ""The pain... it's driving me mad.""
I knelt beside him, placing my hands on his fevered skin. The familiar warmth flowed from me, golden threads of healing energy that soothed not just his wounds but the wild desperation in his wolf's eyes. One by one, I moved through the tent, each healing taking a piece of my strength, each grateful look from a warrior adding another weight to my shoulders.
By the time the sun reached its peak, my hands trembled with exhaustion. The guards were already growing impatient, checking their watches and muttering about schedules.
""That's enough for today,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.
""Alpha's orders were clear,"" the larger guard replied. ""Every wounded warrior gets treatment.""
""I can barely stand—""
""Then sit. But you're not leaving until they're all healed.""
The afternoon bled into evening. When we finally returned to the packhouse, my legs could barely carry me up the front steps. The familiar scent hit me before I even opened the door—musk and arousal, thick and cloying in the air.
My stomach lurched.
Clothes were scattered across the living room like discarded promises. Caelum's shirt hung from the banister, Marise's lace underwear draped over the coffee table like a flag of conquest. The carpet beneath my feet felt damp, and I didn't want to think about why.
""Oh, you're back!"" Marise's voice rang out from the kitchen, sickeningly sweet. She appeared in the doorway wearing nothing but Caelum's button-down shirt, her perfect curls cascading over her shoulders. ""Perfect timing. We're absolutely starving.""
I stared at her, my wolf whimpering in my chest like a wounded animal.
""I was thinking pasta tonight,"" she continued, examining her manicured nails. ""Something with cream sauce. You know how Caelum loves it when things are... rich and satisfying.""
The innuendo wasn't lost on me. Nothing ever was with Marise.
""I need to rest,"" I managed, my voice cracking.
""Rest?"" She laughed, the sound like breaking glass. ""Sweetie, you're the Luna. This is your job. Besides, you look fine to me.""
Fine. I caught my reflection in the hallway mirror—hollow cheeks, dark circles under my eyes, my once-lustrous hair now dull and brittle at the ends. I looked like a ghost of myself.
""The living room needs cleaning too,"" Marise added, gesturing at the mess they'd made. ""And tomorrow I'll need you to pick up a few things from town. I'll make you a list.""
""What kind of things?""
Her smile turned predatory. ""Oh, just some items to help keep Caelum... interested. You understand, don't you? A woman has to work to keep her man satisfied.""
My wolf snarled, a sound that escaped my throat before I could stop it.
""Careful,"" Marise purred, stepping closer. ""That almost sounded like jealousy. But we both know you're much too good for such petty emotions, aren't you, Elowen?""
The days blurred together after that. Healing in the morning, returning to their aftermath in the evening. Cooking their meals while they disappeared upstairs, the sounds of their passion echoing through the house like torture. Cleaning up their messes, washing their sheets, pretending not to see the way Marise watched me with those cold blue eyes, drinking in my humiliation like fine wine.
Each night, I curled up in the guest room—my own bedroom now forbidden to me—and pressed my hand to my still-flat stomach. Two months along, and my secret felt like the only thing keeping me sane.
Soon, I whispered to the life growing inside me. Soon we'll find a way out of this.
But each day made that promise feel more like a lie.
Tonight was no different. I dragged myself through the front door, my healing energy completely depleted, my wolf barely a whisper in my consciousness. The living room was worse than usual—cushions thrown everywhere, wine stains on the white carpet, the air thick with their scent.
I needed a shower. I needed to wash away the day, the pain, the constant reminder of what my life had become.
The bathroom door was slightly ajar, steam escaping from within. I pushed it open, desperate for the sanctuary of hot water and solitude.
""Where do you think you're going?""
Caelum's voice stopped me cold. He stood in the doorway behind me, his green eyes hard as emeralds, his nostrils flaring.
""I... I just wanted to shower,"" I stammered.
""Not yet."" His hand shot out, gripping my arm with bruising force. ""Come here.""
He dragged me back into the living room where Marise sat curled on the couch, wearing a silk robe that barely covered her thighs. Her lips curved in anticipation, like she was about to watch her favorite show.
""You smell wrong,"" Caelum said, his voice low and dangerous. ""Different.""
My heart hammered against my ribs. ""I don't know what you mean.""
""Don't lie to me."" His hands were on me then, roughly patting down my clothes, searching for something I didn't understand. His nose pressed against my neck, inhaling deeply, and I felt his body tense.
""You have several other scents on you,"" he growled. ""Male.""
""No, that's because of the treatment—""
""Is it?"" Marise's voice cut through the air like a blade. ""Maybe our little Luna isn't as innocent as she pretends. Maybe she likes being touched by other men.""
""No!"" The word tore from my throat. ""I would never—""
But Caelum wasn't listening. His grip tightened on my hair, fingers tangling in the silver-gold strands as he yanked my head back. Pain shot through my scalp, bringing tears to my eyes.
""You think I'm stupid?"" he snarled. ""Are you so thirsty that you seduce other males?""
""Caelum, please—""
""Who was it?"" His face was inches from mine now, his breath hot against my skin. ""Which one of those warriors couldn't keep his hands to himself?""
The healing. He was smelling the healing. The close contact, the shared energy—it must have left traces of their scent on my skin. But how could I explain that? How could I make him understand when he'd already decided I was guilty?
""Maybe she's been enjoying her little trips to the medical tent a bit too much,"" Marise suggested, her voice dripping with false concern. ""All those grateful, wounded men... it must be quite the power trip.""
""Stop,"" I whispered, but my voice was lost in Caelum's rage.
His hand fisted tighter in my hair, and suddenly I was moving, being dragged across the room. My feet scrambled for purchase on the hardwood floor as he hauled me toward the back door.
""If you want to act like a whore,"" he spat, ""then you can be cleaned like one.""
The night air hit my skin like a slap as he threw open the door and dragged me into the yard. The garden hose lay coiled by the side of the house, attached to the high-pressure nozzle he used to wash his car.
Understanding dawned on me like ice water in my veins.
""Caelum, no—""
But he was already reaching for the nozzle, his movements sharp and violent. Behind us, I could hear Marise's delighted laughter floating through the open door.
""This should wash off whatever filth you've been rolling in,"" he said, his voice cold as winter.
The first blast of water hit me like a physical blow, the pressure so intense it knocked me off my feet. I hit the ground hard, my knees scraping against the concrete as the icy stream followed me down.
""Please!"" I gasped, trying to shield my face with my arms. ""Please stop!""
But he didn't stop. The water pounded against my body like liquid hammers, each impact sending shockwaves of pain through my bones. My clothes plastered against my skin, then began to tear under the relentless pressure.
I tried to stand, to run, but my feet slipped on the wet concrete and I went down again. The nozzle followed me, merciless, the water cutting into my skin like tiny knives.
""Caelum!"" I screamed, my voice breaking. ""I'm pregnant!""
But my words were lost in the roar of water and his rage. Dark bruises bloomed across my arms and legs where the pressure was strongest. Thin lines of blood began to seep through the tears in my skin, mixing with the water and running pink down the drain.
My wolf was howling now, a sound of pure anguish that echoed in my chest. She was in agony—not just from the physical pain, but from the betrayal, the rejection, the complete destruction of everything we'd believed about our mate.
""Stop… please, I—I can't take this anymore.""I sobbed, curling into myself on the floor.""Please… reject me. Don't torture me like this.""
Something in my voice must have finally reached him, because the water stopped. I lay there gasping, shivering, my body a map of bruises and cuts. Every breath was agony, every movement sent fresh waves of pain through my battered form.
The water gun clattered to the ground with a hollow metallic sound that echoed in my ears like a death knell. But Caelum wasn't finished with me. His eyes held that familiar cold calculation as he grabbed my arm, his grip bruising.
""You think that's enough?"" His voice was low, dangerous. ""You think you can just wash away whatever you've been doing behind my back?""
Before I could protest, before I could even breathe, his canines extended. The sharp points gleamed in the harsh afternoon light as he yanked my head to the side, exposing the tender skin of my neck where his original mark lay faded and scarred from years of neglect.
""No, please—"" The words barely escaped my lips before he bit down, hard and merciless.
The pain was excruciating, but it was nothing compared to the agony that followed. Through the forced bond, I felt everything—his disgust, his possessiveness, his complete and utter indifference to my suffering. But worse, so much worse, was what came next.
Images flooded my mind through our connection. Caelum with Marise, their bodies intertwined in ways that should have been sacred between mates. I saw every touch, felt every sensation as if it were happening to me. The betrayal cut deeper than any physical wound ever could.
""Feel that,"" he growled against my neck, his voice muffled by blood—my blood. ""Feel what a real woman can give me. What you never could.""
My legs gave out, but he held me upright, forcing me to experience every moment of his infidelity through the bond he'd just strengthened. Marise's laughter rang in my ears, both from memory and from where she stood watching us now, her eyes bright with cruel satisfaction.
""Oh, this is perfect,"" she purred, clapping her hands together like a delighted child. ""She can feel everything now, can't she? Every time you touch me, every time you—""
""Stop,"" I whispered, but the word came out broken, barely audible.
Caelum released my neck, letting me collapse to the muddy ground. Blood trickled down my shoulder, mixing with the water that still dripped from my hair. ""Now you'll always know,"" he said, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. ""You'll always feel exactly what you mean to me.""
The days that followed blurred together in a haze of numbness and pain. I moved through the healing tents like a ghost, my hands working automatically while my mind retreated somewhere far away. The deeper mark on my neck throbbed constantly, a reminder of my place in this pack—not as Luna, but as a tool to be used and discarded.
""Elowen, we need you in tent three,"" someone called out, but their voice sounded distant, underwater.
I nodded mechanically, wiping my hands on a bloodstained cloth before moving to the next patient. A young warrior lay writhing on the cot, his leg mangled from a border skirmish. The sight should have moved me to immediate action, but I felt nothing. Even my wolf had retreated so deep inside me that I could barely sense her presence.
I placed my hands on the warrior's leg, letting what remained of my healing energy flow into him. The familiar drain pulled at my core, but I welcomed it. Physical exhaustion was easier to bear than the emotional devastation that threatened to consume me whenever I stopped moving.
""You're slower today,"" the warrior complained, his face twisted in pain. ""The others said you used to be faster.""
I didn't respond. What was there to say? That every time I used my abilities now, I felt Caelum's contempt through our bond? That healing others had become a form of self-torture?
""Elowen!"" Another voice, sharper this time. ""We have three more coming in from the eastern border. Move faster.""
I finished with the warrior and stumbled to the next tent, my vision blurring at the edges. When had I last eaten? When had I last slept? The days had become an endless cycle of healing, cleaning, and trying to ignore the constant stream of images Caelum seemed to delight in sending through our bond.
In tent five, I found myself cleaning vomit from a fevering wolf's chin while he thrashed in delirium. The acidic smell made my empty stomach clench, but I forced myself to continue. Someone thrust a bowl of cold soup into my hands.
""Eat while you work,"" they ordered. ""We can't afford for you to collapse.""
I spooned the tasteless broth into my mouth while holding down the patient's convulsing arm with my other hand. The irony wasn't lost on me—they needed me functional, but they couldn't spare five minutes for me to eat in peace.
""Could you hurry up?"" A beta warrior stood in the tent opening, his arms crossed impatiently. ""We've got wounded piling up outside, and you're in here having lunch.""
""I'm—"" I started to explain, but he'd already turned away.
""Always something with omegas,"" I heard him mutter to his companion. ""Give them the smallest responsibility and they think they deserve special treatment.""
The words hit me like physical blows. After everything I'd sacrificed, everything I'd given to this pack, they still saw me as nothing more than my designation. Not their Luna. Not even a person. Just an omega who should be grateful for the chance to serve.
I set down the soup, my appetite completely gone, and moved to the next patient. My hands shook as I worked, whether from exhaustion or emotion, I couldn't tell anymore.
""The healing tent always smells like omega now,"" someone complained from outside. ""It's distracting.""
""Maybe if she didn't spend so much time in there,"" another voice replied with a laugh. ""Though I guess that's all she's good for.""
The casual cruelty in their voices made my chest tighten. These were wolves I'd healed, wolves whose lives I'd saved countless times. But to them, I would always be lesser. Always be other.
I stumbled out of the tent, gasping for air that didn't seem to fill my lungs. The camp bustled around me, wolves going about their duties without sparing me a glance. I was invisible to them unless they needed something from me.
I don't belong here, the thought whispered through my mind like a revelation. I never belonged here.
For three years, I'd tried to prove myself worthy of being Caelum's mate, worthy of being this pack's Luna. But the truth was staring me in the face—I was nothing more than a convenient tool. A healing machine that happened to share their Alpha's bed.
The realization should have broken me, but instead, it felt almost liberating. If I didn't belong here, then maybe... maybe I could belong somewhere else.
That evening, while the pack celebrated another successful raid, I slipped away from the camp. No one noticed my absence—they were too busy drinking and boasting about their victories. Victories built on the backs of the wolves I'd healed, the lives I'd saved so they could fight another day.
I walked until I reached the border, where the familiar territory gave way to wild, unclaimed land. The moon hung low and full above me, casting everything in silver light. For the first time in months, I felt like I could breathe.
The wind carried scents from beyond our territory—pine and earth and something wild and free that called to the wolf still hiding deep inside me. I closed my eyes and let myself imagine what it would be like to just... keep walking. To leave behind the pain and humiliation and constant, grinding exhaustion.
What would it feel like to be free?
The thought was so seductive, so tempting, that I took another step forward. Then another. The border markers fell behind me as I walked into the unknown, my bare feet silent on the forest floor.
Maybe this was the answer. Maybe this was how I could finally escape the nightmare my life had become. The pack wouldn't miss me—not really. They'd miss my healing abilities, but they'd find another way to manage. They always did.
I reached the edge of a cliff that overlooked a vast valley, the moonlight turning the landscape into something ethereal and beautiful. Below, a river wound through the darkness like a silver ribbon. It would be so easy to just... let go. To finally stop fighting a battle I could never win.
I closed my eyes and took another step forward, feeling the ground crumble slightly under my feet. The wind whipped my hair around my face, and for a moment, I felt weightless.
Then strong arms wrapped around my waist, pulling me back from the edge with such force that we both stumbled backward. I gasped, my eyes flying open as I found myself pressed against a broad chest, surrounded by a scent that made my wolf stir for the first time in weeks.
""Easy,"" a deep voice rumbled above me, rich and warm like honey over gravel. ""You're safe.""
I tilted my head back and found myself staring into eyes the color of storm clouds—deep gray with flecks of silver that seemed to glow in the moonlight. His face was all sharp angles and strong lines, framed by dark hair that looked like he'd been running his fingers through it. He was tall, so tall that I had to crane my neck to meet his gaze, and something about his presence made me feel small and protected rather than diminished.
The moment our eyes met, the world seemed to shift on its axis. A jolt of electricity shot through me where his hands touched my waist, spreading outward until every nerve ending in my body was singing. My wolf, who had been silent for so long, suddenly lifted her head and howled with recognition.

1pcjkx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1pcjkx4/my_mom_exploded_at_me_out_of_nowhere_i_froze_had/,"My mom exploded at me out of nowhere, I froze, had a panic attack, and she kept yelling. I don’t know how to process this.","Hi everyone. I’m a f26, and I need some outside perspective because I feel emotionally overwhelmed and unsure if I’m overreacting. 

Yesterday, I invited my parents over for breakfast. Everything was calm and cozy in the beginning. We were talking about my recent trip to Bali, and I mentioned how kind and grateful the people there are, even though they don’t have much. My mom asked if we helped anyone financially, and I said we helped where we could.

Out of nowhere she shifted the whole conversation and told me that I never help her. She said I only think about myself, that I never help her financially, and brought up an example about a time I bought her some underwear she asked me for. She said that because I told her the price and she transferred me the money, I should have refused the payment and just given them to her. She basically said I should have shown “more humility,” whatever that means.

The whole atmosphere changed instantly. I got quiet because it hurt and confused me, it felt so unfair and unprovoked. She could see I was upset, and instead of calming down, she got angry that I was still sad about it after 5 minutes. She didn’t drink her coffee and basically stormed out the door, leaving me shocked and feeling small, guilty, and sick inside.

This kind of behavior from her isn’t new. I grew up with this. Suddenly turning on me, humiliating me, getting angry if I show emotions, making everything my fault. I’ve always had a more secure and calm relationship with my dad, so I was also sad that he just left with her because I had been looking forward to seeing him.

I called her many times and she didn’t pick up. She had a habit of “punishment” when she gets angry. Today, I called her again because I wanted to repair things. I didn’t blame her - I just apologized because I didn’t want the tension. The moment she picked up, she started scolding me again. She said I “kicked her out” yesterday because, in her mind, I should have stopped her from leaving. She expected me to physically stop her or beg her to stay. I froze yesterday because I went into shock, but she didn’t care, i tried to tell her my version but she didn’t care. She called me many bad names and kept going. 

While she was yelling today, I started having a panic attack. I couldn’t breathe, I was shaking, crying, saying “I’m sorry” over and over just to make her stop. She didn’t stop. Even after my panic attack, she kept scolding me. In the end we hang up. She has never seen me have a panic attack before - she doesn’t know I have anxiety. 

Now I’m left feeling emotionally drained, shaky, guilty, sad, and honestly a bit traumatized. My body feels like I’m still in that fear-state. I know this isn’t normal behavior, but I don’t know how to fully process it because this is how she has always been with me since childhood. I work as a social worker, because I don’t want children to grow up like I did. Now i’m even thinking of taking a sick day because i’m scared that this + work stress will end it a long term sick leave. 

I don’t want to cut her off, but I also don’t know how to keep myself safe emotionally when she behaves like this.

How do I deal with a mother who reacts like a child, punishes with guilt, rewrites reality, and doesn’t stop even when I’m having an actual panic attack?
And how do I calm my body after something like this?",1,1764707440.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

**Location: Grenelka, Vurpon City underground**

**Date [Standardized Terran Time]: August 23rd, 2134**

***

Beyond the glowing ring of the melted hatch we are met with breath-taken silence and hundreds of oily black eyes staring at us from the dim emergency light.

No guns came alive from their backs. 

No exorig barraged forward, shaking the ground with its gallop, its guns disgorging fire and plasma - only silence. Only the eyes. And then, spurts of frightened braying from the few children… foal-things. My attention zeroes on them for a second, noting the stick-like legs and nubby horns as they huddle closer to the adults.

*What did I say just half an hour earlier? Kill everyone*

I tighten my grip on the gun, armor cracking with nearly the same sound that freshly molted Tilfish carapaces did under the boot.

Before us lies a wider chamber. Stretching some sixty or so meters to the next hatch, it’s haphazardly filled with medical equipment and warm bodies. Blankets and resting pedestals, which the stripers use instead of beds, are strewn around, intermixed with pillars of portable heaters that glow a steady yellow in the thermal imaging overlay of my HUD.

The stripers look miserable. Clothes, or rather, the sparse rags that pass for them among the yulpa, are torn and dirty, slathered with ash. They must’ve come from the surface, where their cities are getting flattened by our ground and orbital artillery. I spot limbs wrapped in gauze; pools of ink-black blood nobody had the time to clean; and a few corpses covered by plastic sheets.

It’s an infirmary, I decide. Not the shelter’s main one, but a makeshift one, perhaps, to wait out before they could be moved.

I notice a few Priests of Giving among the cowering aliens, mouths hanging open and tongues outstretched in prayer. Someone with a forelimb-mounted manipulator, uses a laser scalpel to operate right on the ground. 

But everything freezes when our guns bristle in their direction.

Time crawls in heartbeats on heartbeats. One, two…
Fahl was bloody, but the small reptilians folded fast and that invasion never pushed us to the limit that we as a force, as brotherhood, were capable of. 

Silis, on the other hand… I remember how when we found that enormous hatchery, Sazha stuck her snout right into the larval pods to slurp the protein-rich jelly inside and snack on whatever was growing there. 

Before we burned it all down.

And the Tilfish, unlike the Yulpa, were barely present within the Extermination Fleet.

*The heat coming from Mira’s breastplate seeps even through my armor. My claws charr as I frantically pry her helmet’s visor off-*

For a fraction of a second, as I detachedly study our tiny reflections in the wide-open, terrified eye of the nearest striper, I feel a terrible and intimate connection to the Yulpa. 
They worship the Great Life-giver Spirit, but it is *death* that binds us together in this moment. The inevitability of it.

We all know how it will end. I can almost taste the dread through the barrier of my sealed helmet.

But they don’t plead. Don’t ask for mercy - even though I wish they did, but they rob me of the satisfaction to deny it. 

They know their fate. As prey. As the Yulpa Ascendancy. As those who cut our parents and siblings apart, as those who hunted them, as those who plunged Terra into years of strife and ruin,

A better - by the standards of old humanity, the one that died under the anti-matter bombs - person, would’ve noticed the bitter irony in us standing here, beneath this burning planets’ surface, preparing to make a whole *species* history. 

Just like some Krakotl or Yulpa did 36 years ago when they descended to wipe us out to the last.

After all, the memorial in Shanghai is one of a mother holding their child, half-shielding them with their body, right as the flames consume them.

But, I’m not better. 

I’m just me, Luka Abaurre, Captain of the 6th Recon Assault Company, “Scythes”. Soldier of the United Dominion, and nothing more. 

*Nothing* more.

In this moment, I don’t hate the Yulpa or the Federation at large, for what they did to us. Not really. *I hate that they didn’t succeed*. So, we won’t make such a mistake. 

The lesson they had foolishly imparted on us, on me, is learned. We’d be fools if we didn’t, after all.

With a commanding blink to the HUD, I draw up data on the ammo reserves of our unit. Sufficient, if used smartly.

“Switch weapons to full-auto, single shots, conserve ammo - clear the chamber”

After Silis, this is *easy*. I tell myself it is, and the finger, the still blackened claw, hooks around the trigger with practiced, assured smoothness as minutes before. 

We open fire. Tight and controlled. Right into the mass of them. Bullet or dart for every striper, head or torso. Doesn’t matter if it’s not fully lethal - those that won’t die now, *will* when we shut down the ventilation system. 
Still, we can’t leave them behind our backs.

Priests go down first. Then a medic that rises to rushes us with a metal scalpel in his tongue. The large. The small. “Foals” are ripped apart at even a single bullet. 

And we move forward. Slow. Methodical. Aim, single shot. Aim again. Like a virtual shooting range. It lasts for 17 seconds before the stampede begins and the survivors blindly flee to the opposite door, well-knowing that whoever is on that side is holding their own line against the “predatory monsters.”

With their backs turned and their creepy horizontally slitted eyes glazed by the madness and despair of the stampede, it’s harder to shoot accurately as they press onto each other, climbing over one another in a blind drive to *get out*.

“Blades!” I order, and the Arxur sprint ahead, ramming into the teeming mass of the yulpa from behind to hack and slash at unprotected flesh. In a few seconds, the rest of us joins in to partake in the slaughter.

When it’s over, we spent a precious twenty minutes dragging all the piled bodies from the hatch so that the “Hot Poker” can be rolled in.

Then there’s another door.

And another.

*And…*

“Oh, Major Abaurre! Apologies for having you wait - please, come in! It’s a pleasure to meet you in person.”

I blink and the haze of the battle, the feeling of clutching a Yulpa’s horn in my grasp while I use the deactivated fireblade to saw through the thick muscle of its twitching neck, dissipates. In its place I see a thin female face and a dour gaze thrown over a pair of frameless glasses.

Milintel Director Jones. The fabled cougar… well, she does unceremoniously take my hand to shake it.
I smile and step through, habitually hunching to not bump my head on the doorframe.

“The pleasure is entirely mine, Director. And…?” I see another man, tall, in a dress uniform, emerge from the shadows behind Director Jones and too stretch out a hand for a greeting.

“General-Colonel Yuri Voronin.”

“I’m honored, General.”

***

**Location: Terra, Iran, Qom Province Date** 

**[Standardized Terran Time] January 18th, 2135**

The meeting room is nothing special. Large just enough to fit a table with the plastic flower of a conference system; the walls are left blank, and there’s a red light of a surveillance camera blinking in one of the ceiling’s corners.

A small drink tray with a coffee machine is parked behind the desk. 

The space is tight and dim, a cage more than anything else, and I knew it wasn’t. Considering everything, Director Jones is a real spider queen as she sits at the center of a vast, parsecs-spanning web and pulls at the strings when some unfortunate prey manages to tangle itself up on the sticky snares.

I am no prey, however, and the cramped little room is still luxury compared with what you get on a strikeship.

Not waiting to be offered a seat, I take one and drop into it. Lounge, stretching my legs unceremoniously, not caring that the uniform pants ride up around the calves, baring my scarred calves. 

And only then take a good look at my vis-a-vis.

Jones is as indescript as someone of her position needs to be. Bony and bleak in all her colors, from straw-blond hair to pale, washed out blue eyes,  she exudes a sense of bureaucratic blandness so overwhelming that she practically *erases* herself out of mind the moment you avert your eyes from her visage.

She doesn’t even look much like an Atrox, with only the height giving it away. Doesn’t fill out the grey suit much and her claws are clipped to a professional, almost Old Breed length. 

But her gaze is sharp and attentive. It would’ve peeled me back layers - if I had any to begin with.

General-colonel Voronin is a different matter. Older than me, broader. His rigid posture is a neon sign for his military occupation, even if one took his uniform away. And even with salt and pepper in the tightly cropped fuzz on his head, he still sizes me up, eyes gleaming faintly from the deep recesses of his eyesockets. 

I return the favor. It takes more than some scowls to intimidate me.

Still, when he greeted me, I felt an icy hand squeeze my guts. The voice is different, but the accent… Mira. *Mira*.

My right fist balls up, claws digging into the palm. I can’t react like this. After all, there’s a significant Russian presence in Terran Command, and if I lose my cool every time someone reminds me of Mira, I-... 

After most of the densely-populated western Europe got wiped off the world map during the Glassing (including my home country, Spain) and the US had called for Dominion’s help in order to avoid devolving into a patchwork of warlord-led remnants, it was China, India and Russia that had risen up the rebuilding effort in the early fallout.

It was mankind’s luck that even after suffering some of the biggest population losses, China still had enough manpower to begin the restoration of our civilization, while Russia - from what little I knew of it - historically seemed unkillable. 

In the timeframe between the Extermination Fleet being spotted and the bombs actually falling, they managed to somehow sneak all of their military industry to the tundra, counting on the Feds to not bomb half a continent of empty frozen forest. 
So when the dust settled, out popped the Russians to start producing weapons. First exclusively for Terran Command and then later - jointly with the Arxur for the United Dominion at large.

Not surprising that it had bought them a lot of seats in Command. 

“Congratulations on the recent promotion, Major Abaurre”, Jones says as she moves towards the drinks tray. Glass clinks on glass. I look at the back of Jones’s neck, where the hair is combed high to form a bun, watching muscles and tendons move as she speaks without turning her head.  “Is it Hunter-Exalted by now?”

“Thank you, Director. Yes, it is.”

“Mhmm. Tea?”

I mumble a “yes”, and the woman turns around, handing me a simple white cup on a plate, both so comically small they look like toys when my hands swallow them.

“Grenelka…”, Voronin drawls, words like rocks in an industrial-grade tumbler. “Scorch Directive. From Terra it looked nothing less than spectacular. Generalissimus Meier’s historic speech, the orders passed. Crowds gathered in every city’s streets to watch the broadcast. And the celebration afterwards was grand… Can’t imagine how it felt from down there.”

I sip the lukewarm tea, trying to imagine the elation here, on Terra. When the planet burned below *Riyadh*, I was in the infirmary’s ICU, along with what was left of my units. We got the live feed as a consolation prize, streamed right into the ward’s holo panels. 

It was a relief to see the antimatter bombs disengage from the fleet in orbit and descend on the short stubby wings through the thick atmosphere. To watch that wretched rock go dark and then impossibly bright as explosions, in waves, rippled across its surface.

“Less climactic than in the movies”, I say finally. “Like a job done and gone.”

Jones settles down in a chair opposite of me. Fingers intertwining and glasses pushed down her nose in a teacher-like manner. Voronin whips out a holopad. 

“You are a combat officer”, he continued. “What’s your assessment of the Grenelka campaign, Major?”

“Is this what I’m here for?” I squint, not even trying to hide my suspicions, and Jones shakes her head. 

“No, but it wouldn’t hurt to hear from someone of your rank who was on “zero ground”. For posterity,”

”Permission to speak freely, Director?”

Voronin smirks, but quickly drops it when Jones shoots him a stern glance, her eyes colder than the vacuum of deep space.

 No, wrong. 

The vacuum of space has no “real” temperature, it has an absence of one. Just like the absence of humanity in her eyes. The look of a woman that didn’t know warmth at all. 

It’s very familiar, like staring into a mirror.

“Of course, Major.”

“Well, the Command’s decisions to conduct planetside operations wasted dozens of thousands of lives”, at that, the General’s face hardens, but I lift an index finger to indicate there’d be a follow-up. “However, since I cleared one of their bomb shelters, I’ve seen how well they’ve prepared for something like the Directive. I understand that the ground campaign was necessary to complete it.”

“Your units suffered a 47% casualty rate.” Voronin looks up from his tab, brow raised in what I assume would be a “gotcha” moment. 

I tap my claws on the armrest. Tap-tap-tap. The ghosts behind my back scream into my ear, but not loud enough for me to not ignore them.

“When the average was hovering around 70%.” I point out dryly.

“Indeed it was. As far as we know, you were highly commended for it”, Jones nods in agreement. “Both by Terran *and* Arxur commanders.” 

Commendation, huh. Well, everyone  got their degree of praise and commendation, even some Betterment rotfangs that hadn’t sniffed a lick of Exterminator fuel or touched that planet's soil with a claw, yet came running to snatch the spoils. 

The less you say, the less there is rope to hang yourself with, so I just nod.

“I have to say that Milintel watched your career with great interest”, Jones takes out her own pad and starts flicking through the screens. “It seems that much of it was facilitated by high-ranking Arxur officers… hunters. Senior Hunter Razhir, Senior Hunter Kohiz, even, oh, Chief Hunter Coth?”

This forces me to perk up, even despite knowing that I *shouldn’t*. But the body reacts before I can consciously cut the reaction. No, no, *relax* Luka. 

Play it *cool.*

“Is there something wrong with that?” I ask, perhaps too curtly. 

“Terrans… *humans* being promoted by Abidence isn’t that common”, Jones produces a tiny, tight-lipped smile while Voronin cocks his head, studying me like some specimen in a Petri dish. “Crocs hate that we’re not subject to Betterment. You must have a good relationship with your Arxur subordinates and superiors.”

Catching an implication of judgement, I jerk my chin up and glare.

“I serve the United Dominion”.

As I utter the last word, Jones abruptly leans over the table as if to cut the distance between us. The previously collected, bureaucracy-smoothened facade slips.

“Cut the crap, Major! “Serve the United Dominion”, where do you think you *are*, in a propaganda photoshoot? Don’t flatter yourself!” she hisses with sudden vitriol. “We looked into it and it became clear as day that you moved through the ranks because of… what would you describe it as, Yuri?”

“Bribery”, the general purrs.

“Bribery?!” I echo, stunned by the revelation.

“Izhali. Fahl. Ramtan-7. Qunox. Kenoosh Beta. Silis”, he lists, curling a claw after claw. “Doesn’t ring a bell? You’ve made yourself quite a name as the go-to Terran when someone needs fresh… Fed *supplies*. Or Intel on defectives. Or turning a blind eye on some Arxur *entertainment*.”

I stay silent, focused on keeping my jaws together instead of letting the lower hang agape. Alright, *breathe*. See where this is going.

“On Silis, for example, your orders from Commander Bhule was to map all the energy grid substations in your sector of responsibility for an orbital strike. But instead of reporting one of the six your units had mapped, you instead relayed the coordinates to Hunter-Exalted Hafthiz.”

“And we know why”, Jones butts in. “It was adjacent to a Tilfish incubator facility, filled with close to ten thousand larval containers. Hafthiz’s Hunter-Provider packs sent a procurement shuttle after them under the cover of ongoing battles, and later it got buried in paperwork. Clever. Very clever.”

“Is that illegal somehow?” Not being able to argue against the fact, I snap at them. Immediately, Voronin snarls back.

“You re-interpreted orders in your favor - of course it was! Then that lizard pulled some strings for the “Scythes”, including re-routing a shipment of four crates of Mk.IV “Razorbacks”. And you received a glowing review in Coth’s earholes!”

“And it only emboldened you, Major. Arxur weren’t stupid either - they curried favor with *their* Command off your back”, Jones lets out a sarcastic chuckle. “Hand washes the other hand, both Betterment happy, and your career steadily gaining steam.”

So they know I’ve been doing that. That… makes sense. They’re Milintel, after all. 

Am I really that surprised that not only it’s not flushed in the open, but had been known for a while? No. Not at all.

But the fact that I’m *accused* of it, is something new. Something that burns at my very core, something that is so fundamentally insulting that I can’t bear hearing it one more second.

I push myself to my feet, claws raking grooves into the table. The pressure that’s been building up in my chest, rises - and finally spills out.

“Are you accusing me of disloyalty?” I bare my fangs and drops of saliva fly out with the bellow, but I don’t care. “Is this what it is about? You think I’ve been compromised by Betterment? How fucking *dare* you! I’m a combat officer, I’ve been wounded numerous times in the lines of duty, I’ve lost and bled for Terra, and *you*…!”

Now fully unfurled from my seat, I loom over them like a bad omen. Voronin too, jumps up. He glances briefly at Jones and then back at me, fists knuckle-white. I can see it in the chiseled angles of his face, in the pewter shine of his pupils - this reckless urge to scrap with the biggest bloke in the room that I’ve seen so many times before. Strange how our age does nothing to dull these impulses… 

For all the looking down on Betterment, Milintel sure subscribes to the same ardent philosophy of “might makes right”. 

The stand-down lasts a few seconds before Jones’ face softens… if you could say that of a pane of tempered glass shaped into something vaguely feminine.

“No. But let’s take a listen to this”, her claw taps on the tablet. 

A voice fills the room.

“*There needs to be more humans in the United Dominion. Brass, in high places. There are some, but nowhere near enough… We need to get in their good books. Earn the status. Bit by bit, until we change the United Dominion to truly serve mankind - and Arxurkind. And these are just the bricks I… lay into this foundation. Betterment enjoys prime stock. Fealty.*”

She stops the playback. Points at the pad.

“This - this can be interpreted as treason. Building a divide between Terra and Wriss, conspiring against allied structures”, she shakes her head, the not-cold returning to her voice. “You’re very lucky that this hasn’t leaked to the Abidence somehow.”

Well. Now I know that the trick with the helmet mic and gum didn’t work and whoever listened to my ramblings *cared* for what I was saying. 

My face grows hot and the tips of my fingers tingle. *Alright*. Implication’s clear. They want something from me. If Jones really believed it to be treason, there’d be MP enforcers cracking my skull open with a baton to subdue and drag me away, not this increasingly bizarre conversation.

I sip and then swish the tea around in my mouth, using it as a gag to not blurt out something stupid. They’ll tell me what they want themselves.

“Should this get out to Wrissan Command, you’d put on an inter-Command court-martial, Abaurre. You will lose it so that Terra saves face,” Voronin picks the thread up and spreads every word far to see me squirm. “And they’d sentence you to death. Which, as I’m sure you’re aware, with Arxur can be a very protracted and painful affair.”

“Why haven’t you come forward, then?” I squeeze out through a squared jaw. 

Jones considers me with a long stare, then stands up, hands tucked into the pockets of her fitted chinos.

“Let’s suppose that you are correct. That the Betterment, the ideology presiding over and guiding the Arxur, is the greatest enemy that keeps the United Dominion from winning the war. It wastes time, resources and breeds discord amongst us. Let’s suppose that the Terran Command decided to combat this threat from *within* the Betterment.”

Click-click-thud. Her heels move between carpet and the hard floor as she paces behind Voronin, the latter studying his pad with a detached expression of someone who has heard this at least a dozen times.

“And suppose we here at Milintel, came to the conclusion we need individuals that are ruthless and shrewd enough to get under the Betterment’s skin and pull Arxur assets to our cause. Sow dissent and provide a channel to this office…”

Click-thud-clack. She turns back to face me, hands gripping the back of her chair and narrows her eyes. Expression tense, but aglow with something… No, not *passion*. Anticipation?

“They would have to speak Arxuri fluently. They’d have to know the lizards’ habits, what makes them tick. And respect them enough to be sincere when pressured”, she lists the requirements off in quick, forceful bursts. “And most importantly, they would have to be respected *by* the Arxur in turn, so - be cruel and unscrupulous. Share all the piss and shit the crocs call a “culture”.”

I straighten out. It’s *me* she’s talking about, not some hypothetical person! That’s not good.

“So you want a spy?” Derision snags on my fangs as Voronin grumblesin his corner. “Director, you have a whole army of spooks and gimps. Pick one, pick a dozen - what’s a few more lives?”

“Wrong. We don’t need an operative - we need someone who’d be a beacon for defectives and Betterment lapdogs. All those who grew tired of the Prophet-Descendant’s so-called leadership, but are afraid of their shadows and think that they’re surrounded by Vigilators and Abidence snitches…”

“But a Terran? Terrans are outside of these games, usually”, Jones finishes for the General. “An envoy that’s meant to foster tighter ties between Terra and Betterment would be beyond suspicion, all while finding dissenters and getting them to serve us.”

A crooked smile splits Voronin’s face as he looks upon Jones.

“No, Director. To serve themselves, firstly. They should believe its in *their* best interest.”

“Indeed. And consider this, Major - Betterment is already cracking. It’s a rotten, filthy thing that stands on its last clay legs of fear. The crocs that live Terra, that serve with you in the Armada or the infantry, they spread words about a system without defectives or castes or persecution. Without the threat of Abidence’s whips and blades. *Our system*. The chokehold is loosening.”

*Not fast enough, apparently*, I think. Too slow for the war to be won decisively before it happens. 

We burned Grenelka, but humanity is a half of what it was, and soon the cracks in *our* capabilities would start showing. That’s what neither Jones nor Voronin is saying, but what they must know if even a borderline grunt like me does. 

“It just needs one final push to topple. The fish rots from the head… we *know* that many Betterment scions are secretly sympathetic to the fall of their order”, Voronin points out. “Some of them genuinely dislike Betterment and the Prophet-Descendant, others see the crash as a way to climb a ladder of power in its absence…”

“But the motive doesn't matter. Yuri is right - it needs a push, and then dominoes would fall as if on theor own.”

For the most part, it’s true. If I got a cred for every time an Arxur in my unit made some vague pass at Betterment, I'd have more creds than I do. 

Take Sazha, my right hand. At the beginning of our service together she was a pretty staunch believer in the Betterment. But now her opinion has shifted to almost the opposite. Fighting together with terrans and defectives left a significant mark.

As my fear and temper settle, I ask the only appropriate question.

”Why me?” 

“Got quite an illustrious biography, Major”, Jones stops her pacing and with a light twist to the hips gracefully slides back behind the table. “Orphanage, Project Aegis, early serum recipient. Then a convict for murder and assault, Martian prison…”

“And a “green” psych test result after the Grenelka campaign?” Voronin adds, squinting with suspicion at me and tapping his pad as if in accusation. “No signs of long-term stress, when we know people are dropping out of the forces at record pace, unable to deal with the consequence of being in that meatgrinder?”

The angle of questioning puts me in a stupor momentarily. Are they seriously asking why I didn’t blow my brains out?

Truth be told, I don’t know myself. Habit and malice, perhaps.

Besides, after Mira, after that charred kiss still on my lips… What’s even the point of breaking? Nobody will be there to witness it, to pick me up, take the pieces and put them together, like Essil’s stupid mug. 

When a tree falls in the forest, and nobody hears it, does it make a sound?

“For fuck’s sake, I’m not a psychopath… Have you heard of the chain of command? Nobody, my men first and foremost, would benefit from me becoming dysfunctional”, I jut my lower jaw forward in defiance and squeeze the armrests of the chair, choking down inanimate leather and steel. “And the “damage” from Grenelka? Overblown crap! We *howled* throats raw from joy when that fucking ball of dirt rippled under the bombs.”

I’m not entirely truthful. With so many men and women, atrox and Arxur, lost… no, not everyone came out of it alright. But that's not what's important here.

“Well, that is good to hear. Good. We don’t want our envoy to overreact from a Hunter-Interrogator flaying a Takkan alive right in front of him, don’t we?”

Jones and Voronin exchange quick glances.

“You asked “why”, major. We had conducted a few remote and direct interviews with some of your former and current subordinates, superiors and pack-mates. You know what they said?”

“Not the slightest idea.”

“Don’t be apprehensive”, Jones wags a finger at me. “Their feedback was mostly positive. Most spoke of your support and leadership, your devotion to the war effort, cold-bloodedness in combat… Yes, they did”, she nods in assurance. “And a few even said, in different words of course, that you’re at times behave more like an Arxur, than a human.”

“What can I say, other than that I’m flattered. *”S volkami zhit’, po volchiyi vit’”*, right, General?” I snap my head towards Voronin and sneer, recalling some of Mira’s favorite phrases.

My accent is horrendous, and Voronin’s smug expression quickly melts into one of scorn. He probably expected more humility, denial that I’m anything but Arxur-like… so fuck him. There’s a good chance he never even left Earth, what to say of staring down a Krakotl’s plasmacaster or hiding from a rampaging Gojid Bruiser exo that just tore your friend apart.

“So, what do you think, Major? I see the gears turning. Talk to us.” Jones continues to eye me, her expression a mix of awe and slight revulsion.

“*Beacon*, fuck. I’m not stupid. This role… It’s bait, not a beacon”, I lick my lips, unable to hide the nerves. “What’s in it for me?”

Leaning back, the Director fumbles with the buttons of her suit to clasp it over the narrow waist. Doesn’t answer right away, but when she does, her tone is back to the bleak nothing it was in the beginning.

“I’ll be completely honest with you, Major - I don’t see your military career getting anywhere. Hitting fifty soon, a collection of injuries… in any other case you should’ve started moving upward as your battlefield value drops, but…”

With a flick of the wrist, she slides the pad towards me. The results of the tests I’ve completed prior to assuming the current position.

“You hadn’t shown a capacity for multidimensional strategic thinking, required of officers taking command of full-sized brigades, and you barely passed the exams for this rank.”

Involuntarily, my lips tighten, fang tips catching the dry skin. No need to… rub it in. I lower my eyes and slide the pad back. The Director cocks her head in an attempt to keep the contact.

”What options do you have, you think?”

“Death or discharge”, my voice is scratchy with reluctant concession.

To that, Jones practically *beams*, half-turning to Voronin and slapping her hand on her thigh.

“See, Yuri? I was right - Major Abaurre is a pragmatic and clear-thinking man. One that surely would assume an important position of power he struggled for all these years”, a hint of a smile touches the corners of her lips.  “The “special military envoy to Wrissan Command” is your chance to build a legacy that you crave.”

I hate that she strikes exactly where she should. Reads me like some sort of cheap 21st century book. 

I ball my hands into fists. Is it wrong to desire all this? To be helpful? To make sure that nothing of what happened to me, happens to the kids on Terra? To pay the Federation back in blood? To care for the future? Power, even?

I’ve been climbing to this point, over a colorful mound of corpses, but not for my own sake. For Mira… her siblings. Sazha’s eggs. For Kezef. Essil. Nguyen. I think so. I am *sure*.

For a while, I don’t say anything. Study the non-interior of the room. Shift. Lick the fangs that still didn’t learn to fully pack behind the lips. Jones notices it, and sighs, eyes rolling ever so slightly.

“I forgot to mention the biggest reward”, putting a strand of hair away, he breaks the silence. “That the recording doesn’t get anywhere… to anyone. Stays buried in our little collection of sins.”

“So if I refuse…?”

“You won’t. I know you’re a good candidate. How, you ask? The *tea*.”

“Tea?” I blink in surprise and glance at the almost empty cup. “What of it?”

Jones breaks in a dry, throaty chuckle unbefitting her slim frame, peal after peal until even Voronin cracks a grin, a wide one under unsmiling eyes.

“The one you’ve been drinking. It was no oolong or pu’er. It’s a *blood-tea*. Directly from Wriss.”

Standing up again, she leans over the table to poke the cup with her index finger and I’m awash in the smell of flowery detergent. To think someone like this woman would have such a misplacedly comforting smell…

“Mix of herbs that Arxur brew on fermented Krakotl and Mazic blood. For most people, like me, just the stench of it is intolerable. Like something died and then was buried in lye. I’ve been suppressing nausea for the last half an hour - but you actually drank it. And didn’t even complain.”

The metallic taste… I touch the rim cup with a claw. *I’m so used to this shit that I don’t even understand it…*

”Anyway, I’m glad you took our offer, Major”, the Director says and stands up, hand outstretched for a handshake. “Looking forward to working together.”

***

The HQ’s cafeteria stays open for some evening bites and I nestle myself into a corner table, away from the few other visitors. My appetite should’ve gotten the best of me, but I sit and pick at the food in my tray that I spent a good half an hour choosing. Coming to Earth always means good, *real food, something to look forward to - and yet neither the salmon poke salad nor the chicken burger makes me salivate. Printed meat, delicious and pure, however…

The blood-tea incident still lingers in my mind as I fidget with the utensils. Turn them around, watch my warped reflection in the polished steel.

“Care if I join, Major?”

A familiar voice rustles by my side, and before I turn to look, Jones is already dropping on the seat opposite to mine. Her necktie is loose, the top of her shirt unbuttoned, and I can see the skin, taught on the sharp collarbones, mottled with pale freckles. 

“Penny for your thoughts?” she sets down a juicebox and a can of yogurt-granola mix. Uncorks the latter.

“Penny…? Ah, the American saying. Well”, I stick the knife into the burger. “I was thinking about the executions Abidence would subject traitors to. Have you ever witnessed them?”

Not a muscle twitches on her face. So she had seen it. I continue nonetheless, because I have a point to make.

“So, it’s a step-by-step process. Starts with the teeth, they pull them out - because prey doesn’t have any. Then they extract the claws - because prey doesn’t hunt. Then they break the person’s legs, hobbling them…”, I gesticulate as I explain, walking her through. “Then the whole tail is flayed, skin and scute pulled off. Sometimes they mess with the uh, you-know-what. After that, the victim is disemboweled, but Arxur are hardy, so they usually survive up to the decapitation.”

Noneplussed, the Director eats her yogurt through all that. 

“Strange thoughts for a late-night dinner, Major.”

“Was just thinking - how does that translate to a human, ‘cause we have no tails?”, a sardonic smile overtakes the controls to my face. “It’s no idle interest… Don’t suppose you’ll send a cavalry after an “envoy”, should things go very wrong?”

She shakes her head. The crunch of the granola carries over the table.

“No, not really. We’ll deny everything.”

”See?”

For a while we eat in silence, only my fork and knife scraping on the plate like a facsimile of an argument. She downs her snack, then opens up a juicebox.

It’s kind of weird to see perhaps, the most powerful woman on Terra, all decked in a sleek suit, sipping juice through a tiny straw like a small child. Then she speaks up again.

”Back to the interviews… a couple of people we talked with had said something along the lines of, hm…”, Jones’s pale pointy nose turns a shade of light pink and her eyes, previously focused on me like a targeting reticle, shift to study a large scratch on the table. “Corporal Abaurre can be lax around some regulations on interpersonal conduct”.

I chuff, revelling in her discomfort at the question. Not the subject, but… she doesn’t know me, and you typically don’t ask people if they fuck around. Yet she does ask, because she factually *owns* me. 

“Regulations are one thing, but you know - comfort and company are hard to find among the stars, between the fights.”

Now the rosy tint touches her cheeks.

“Company of even… other species?”

At that I smile openly.

“That regulation barrier isn’t the one I would personally cross. Others do, however”, I say and pop another piece of potato in my mouth.

Jones seems to process this information and chews on the straw. I wonder if this euphemism game was true curiosity or another ploy of throwing me off-balance. 

However, the color in her bleached-out face was real. Had to be.

“Have you been assigned a lounge at the visitor’s center?”

“No. I’m leaving tomorrow for Baghdad. Want to show a bit of Terra to my second-in-command” I say. “I assume that - that everything here will take time, for the gears to turn?”

“Yes. So you’ll just wait out here?” she waves at the cafeteria, the small sofas lining the other, brow slightly raising in either surprise or concern. I shrug, not getting what’s the big deal.

“That was the plan.”

Jones scratches the side of her face in thought, right at the splash of pink that won’t fade away.

“You could stay at my quarters for the night. It’s not like we get much sleep here, StratCom is always online, so… there’s a comfortable bed, and some drinks.”

“Is this a bribe, Director?” I jab, feeling slightly vindicated for the previous conversation.

“Consider it a courtesy for fucking your life over.”

The word “fucking” is less grey and drab than the rest, standing out with a little twist to her lips. A cue well understood, and my holopad chimes, receiving an access code.

Well. My life is, indeed, *fucked over*.

So, why not? 

***

The Director’s quarters at the Fodrow HQ aren’t the epitome of luxury I expected, but it’s suitably cozy for being a hundred or so meters underground. Faux wood paneling and glossy furniture that’s perfect to attract a collection of fingertip smudges; full size bath.

The personal touches are minimal. Jones keeps a dried-out wispy plant on her desk and a photo of some woman, either her mother or an inspirational model. What’s less of a fake is a collection of old media stacked on a small shelf near the bed - books and little plastic rectangles for audio recordings that I know are called “cassetes”.

One book catches my interest - “Main questions of administrative policy”. Sounds too tame for Jones.

I don’t pry further and right up to her return nap in a chair. 

Her arrival brings full glasses of pre-war whiskey and hungry stares.

After a few drinks and perfunctory exchanges about geopolitics and the state of the war at large, without much preambule Jones takes her clothes off.

Stands nude before me like a challenge, small breasts perked by the cold of the AC, stomach flat under visible ribs. Despite her age, like me, the hard lines of the Director’s body could’ve belonged to someone twenty years younger. 

And circumstances be damned, I can’t hide my rising interest either, so peel the uniform off as well.

She sets her glasses aside. Squints ever so slightly, eyes running across the stretches of my marred skin.

“That is an impressive tapestry, Major”, she says, nodding at the scars. “Don’t worry, I’m not going to ruin it with new marks. Not like this, anyway.”

It goes down… professionally. Neither of us has layers or depth, both are made from the same solid, monolith material. Spite. There’s no hidden tenderness in Jones, no fiery passion that bid its time beneath her skin.

Instead, it’s a fucking special operation. 

Clean, precise. Enter the premises, locate the target, eliminate. Acquire and deliver the data package. A bit of violence is inevitable, but it too, is controlled. Tempered by duty. She hisses when I grab a fistful of her hair and pull, fangs bared - something that Mira never did, not even during our roughhousing. Tries to slap me, but I catch her wrist, clamping so tight I can feel bones strain… and notice a small smirk of satisfaction on her chafed lips.

The fact that it’s nothing like with Mira is a small mercy.

It’s not lovemaking, not a human connection. It’s hatred and pain twisted by an injection of hormones into a semblance of solace.

Workout for the darkest parts of the soul.

When it’s all done, we lay in the sweaty sheets empty and hollowed out, cold damp skin to skin. Just like before. An exercise in futility.

“I hope I don’t have to say that this didn’t really happen?”

“You just did”.

Even though I see her face well in the darkness, it still washes out all the color, turning Jones into a haunted apparition by my side. The spirit of vengeance herself.

“Hmhh, true”, a hand stretches out to caress my jaw with a poor imitation of expected tenderness. Moves to stroke my hair. “Go to Baghdad, Major. Clear your head. Return to the strikeship, finish whatever it is you have with your unit. Find a replacement. You’d be called up to assume your new role with all the honors.”

This sounds like an order to get up, wash, put my clothes back on and leave, especially since the shuttlecar will be waiting for me in an hour on the surface.

I’ve always been good at following orders.

- I generally like 1 cup of coffee for the morning before I leave for work
- I really enjoy lattes more than anything


Preferably I don’t want to spend above £200, but if it’s worth the extra money I can go higher within reason. 

The reason I’m saying all of this is because I understand there’s so much pretentiousness around coffee and that isn’t for me, just would like a decent machine recommendation that works, makes the coffee.. isn’t bad to use and gets the job done for a good experience.

1pcjjd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1pcjjd6/snow_plow_hit_parked_car_in_apt_complex/,Snow plow hit parked car in apt complex,"Location: Wyoming, Michigan

so long story short, my boyfriend’s car was hit in our apartment complex parking lot while it was parked. It was hit by a construction like vehicle with a snowplow in front (not the pick up truck plow, but a giant snow plow, similar to the construction trailers), the driver reversed into his vehicle, being completely negligent and almost dragged his vehicle. He had to hop out and wave for him to stop reversing into it.

My boyfriend hopped out and the driver did as well and he stated and I quote “sorry man I didn’t see you. I have to finish plowing so here is my company card call there figure it out with our insurance.”

Later on that day, my boyfriend called The company and they gave him the insurance name, and said he was in the complex too and he could meet to see the damages in real time. That’s when he informed him that the driver who hit him was actually a co-owner and he’s the other owner. 

So fast forward to today my boyfriend has been in contact with their insurance and they instructed him to get the damages priced and to send over the official quote, then they call him back and say the driver says you were moving and he is not accepting liability for this accident and that he will need to go to small claims court to see any money for this accident

My boyfriend also submitted a police report on Sunday when it happened stating that his vehicle was hit, it does not state in the report that the vehicle was in park when it was hit. I want to add that the police refuse to come out because the accident happened on private property and instructed him to file the report through a link, he did do that and the report was approved however it does not state He was parked. I’m being 100% honest saying he was parked. He never had the car in drive or reverse at the time of the accident, he was out there, cleaning out his car and got super cold. I told him I was going to get coffee in my truck, and He sat in the car to wait. he did not reverse into this snowplow, the snowplow reversed into him. You can even tell from the impact.

Michigan is a no fault state but how do we handle this? What legal advice should we take on? Do we need a lawyer? At the end of the day, a contracted snow plowing company damaged a parked vehicle and refuses to pay for the damages of their negligence. It is not OK and their attitude has been completely a 180 after the call with the insurance regarding the damages! it’s very frustrating and we don’t know what to do. 

TLDR: snow plowing company refuses to accept liability for hitting a parked car in our apartment complex. There’s no cameras to prove anything and they are no longer accepting fault after verbally accepting fault. ",1,1764707345.0,legaladvice,4,1.0,False

This lounge is located above the food court section , of the domestic departures. Air India's Lounge is usually a lot less crowded than some of the other domestic ones, being harder to access.

The lounge had recliners with lots of charging sockets, along with a tea and coffee station. It had a bigger recliner towards the end of partition area for enjoying some extra privacy.

I visited the lounge during late night hours. They offered a diverse range of food choices. 

It had ample space to relax. It felt quiet inside, I almost forgot I was sitting inside Delhi Airport. It was quiet enough , that a few people were actually sleeping.

It also had showers which looked similar to a luxury hotel's interior. By morning the lounge had more people visiting. The breakfast spread was delicious. I enjoyed it more than dinner.

There were a plenty of magazines, television sets and newspaper options , to entertain people. The brown and beige interiors looked really nice.The seats were quite comfortable.

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

📱 **iOS App Store:**

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of ideas, both good and bad.

I (F40) legit am a grumpy, wearied prof who needs my semester to end. A student of mine (M24) asked me during a meeting if I want to get a coffee to discuss my research. For context, I'd never discussed my research in class and the only way they'd find this out is through LinkedIn. I said, stupidly at the time, ""sure, maybe sometime."" Then proceeded to an excuse of grading a lot at this time in the term to distract from the convo. 

He left and was silent for sometime. Now, three  weeks later, I have the student messaging me about picking up treats from the treat box (made up of snacks and college souvenirs for family). Specifically, to meet him to pick up the treats. I discussed a ""Holiday treat box"" with my class and promised to get them a few for our final class. Our holiday box is similar to a Secret Santa and it concerns the whole department. I get a text, not an email, from the student (for reference, our work phone #, not personal one, is available on our site). He then proceeded to ask me if I had any time to come pick them up. 

Help me out here. I've not reported the student because this student doesn't seem threatening, but he doesn't seem to understand boundaries. I've dealt with similar things before -- but they usually move on.

1pcjcrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1pcjcrj/i_had_an_amazing_dream_after_taking_treatment_for/,I had an amazing dream after taking treatment for flu,"I had an unbelievable dream. I woke up shocked and told my wife immediately, and now I’m writing it on ChatGPT and here so I won’t forget. English is not my native language so I used ChatGPT to translate it properly. It has cozmic signs, symbols, cultural differences. 

It went like this:

In my dream, I’m at home in the living room, wearing a smart-casual shirt on top but fleece slippers and pajama bottoms. It’s one of those days when you’re not really unhappy, but you’re definitely not happy either — just pretending everything is fine. I have worries about the future, the political situation in the country, stress from work… It all feels like it’s turning my hair grey day by day. There’s a random reality show on the TV just to make some noise in the background. I hear bits and pieces of it, but I’m neither following what’s on TV nor focusing on my work. Pure unproductivity.

The show is hosted by this strict, confident, urban TV presenter. She’s talking about a man named Mehmet who died in eastern Turkey — a place where tribes, traditions, and family structures dominate everything. Mehmet is around 50, a village man who never left the area, married with kids. He loses control of his car on a mountain road 23 km from the village at night, falls off a cliff, and dies.

And somehow this car crash reveals an illegal love affair. Mehmet apparently had a lover — a woman close to his age, someone the village hates: “ugly, uneducated, cheating, low-status,” wearing traditional clothes, broken accent — the TV host mocks her nonstop. Her name is Fedime.

The part that catches my ear is the host interrogating Fedime in a super condescending tone, while Fedime keeps dodging the questions and bringing everything back to one idea:

“What you people call love isn’t real love. Love is something cosmic.”

The word cosmic grabs my attention. So I stop what I’m doing, grab my laptop, and move in front of the TV to actually watch.

The woman keeps going:

“You’ve been told lies about love all your life — through family, TV series, films, books, even Hamlet. Love is actually something divine, cosmic, just like Dante wrote in the Divine Comedy. Mehmet and I solved this. Mehmet didn’t die — he just left one dimension of existence. We will reunite in the infinity of time and space.”

I’m convinced she’s crazy, and that this is just another cheesy TV drama.

Lunch break comes. I make myself a coffee and keep watching.

Apparently Mehmet’s wife and Fedime’s husband are related — probably siblings. So the affair is even more scandalous. I try not to get distracted by the moral aspect of it, though. The woman continues:

“We solved the equation.”

Now I’m even more intrigued. Two people in a remote village solving some “cosmic” equation? What equation? And how many people in that region even know the word cosmic?

It’s a mess, but I can’t look away. Something is pulling me deeper.

The TV crew goes to the accident site — rural Anatolia, dusty roads, mountains, shot at 24 fps like a documentary. Something about it draws me in.

I feel like I have to talk to Fedime. She’s trying to say something everyone is ignoring. It’s like the whole country is participating in a pantomime to not understand her.

Suddenly I’m in the dream, in the actual village.

I’m looking for her. Everyone makes a face when I mention her name. The TV vans are gone, the chaos has calmed down, Mehmet is still dead, life moved on. A man at the coffeehouse points: “That adobe house at the end.”

I walk there and knock. Fedime opens the door, looking indifferent.
“I came to listen,” I say. “I want to believe you. Something brought me here. From the moment I watched the show, while deciding to come, even when I tried to explain to my wife why I needed to come… I knew this made no sense, but I still had to come. Tell me what you’re trying to say.”

She tells me to sit outside.
It’s surreal — a village woman in her traditional clothes, and me, a city white-collar guy. I’m thinking, Am I just looking for excitement? Why am I here? My wife was right.

She brings me Turkish coffee. I assume she thinks I’m “God’s guest.”
It takes some time to convince her that I actually want to understand her — no one believed her, everyone mocked her on national TV, and the village ostracized her.

She tells me about Mehmet. The books he read. His purpose. How they met. How they secretly discussed his wild ideas. The moment she first heard the word cosmic.

Then she says:
“Tonight is the night.”

“For what?” I ask.

“For the Earth’s axial position in the universe,” she says.
Apparently it happens twice a year.
I realize it’s been exactly 6 months since I first watched her on TV. Now it’s winter.

I put out my cigarette.

“Six months ago, Mehmet tried to verify the equation he was working on. But he made a small calculation error. He tried it 15 days early. That’s why he died.”

I ask her about the equation — what it really explains. She brings a notebook from under her bed. The last pages contain an equation, and the solution is simply:

x = 22

“This equation gives us the exact speed of the expansion of the universe,” she says.
“And that speed is what will lead us to God’s location. Once you know the speed, you can find when you’ll reach Him.”

Mehmet died trying to confirm it, she says.

I, being the arrogant technical-university guy, ask:

“Okay but… do you know where God actually is? Without knowing the destination, the speed is meaningless. Did your guy figure that out?”

I immediately regret my tone. But she answers calmly:

“That was the second question Mehmet was trying to solve. His life wasn’t long enough. So I guess I’m the one who will solve it.”

Then she looks at the old car parked near the haystack and says:

“And tonight, I’m going.”

That’s when I realize I’m screwed. I’m definitely going to die in that car with her tonight.

I set an alarm for 22:00.

Cut to darkness.

I’m in the passenger seat. The driver’s seat is empty, but the car is moving.
It feels exactly like the final scene of Bojack Horseman season 3.

Fedime is in the back. I assume she’s praying.
I wrapped myself in my thickest coat and scarf to protect myself from cuts. Seatbelt on.
I don’t know our speed.
I only hear gravel hitting the underside of the car.
I’m terrified.

Suddenly the headlights turn off.

The moon lights everything — the dirt road, the bushes, the mountains.

The car drifts off the apex of the road.

I curl into the fetal position.

Branches scrape the car.
We leave the road.
We start flipping.

This shouldn’t be the way I die.

The car stops.
I feel no pain.

I hear gravel sliding down behind us.
Steam.

I call out:
“Are you alive?”

She answers in that accent I hated:

“We found it!”

“Mehmet was right.”

At that exact moment, I hear an alarm sound.

I actually wake up.

I check the time.

22:00.

Then I woke up. I’m in shock. I told this my wife.
And now I’m writing all of this here before I forget.

1pcjb6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pcjb6i/you_have_to_try_the_coffee_at_lucis_cafe/,You have to try the coffee at Luci's Cafe,"Do you ever wonder how different your life might have turned out if you changed just one small detail? Changed one seemingly minor decision? I never really considered it, until I found Luci's Cafe. 

I may never have noticed it if I hadn't been looking in the recessed doorways along that sidestreet downtown for a place to spit out my gum. And I wouldn't have been walking down that sidestreet if I hadn't left my headlights on and killed my car battery the night before. And I wouldn't have done that if I hadn't answered when my ex called as I pulled into the parking lot of my apartment building. But, all of those things did happen, and that's how I ended up there.

After I spit out my gum in the garbage can outside, I glanced up at my reflection in the unique storefront window, as pitch black as if  it had been cut from volcanic glass. Old english lettering spelled out 'Luci's Cafe' in firey hues that seemed to shift like glowing embers. I had never seen anything quite like it. I just had to have a look inside. 

The interior of the little shop was not as interesting. It looked more like a dingy waiting room than a coffee shop with a couple of chipped formica tables and yellowing linoleum. I might have turned to go if not for the barista behind the peeling laminate counter, a slender young woman with nervous hands.

""Good morning!"" She greeted me with a little too much enthusiasm, as if she had never seen a customer in her life and hadn't particularly expected too. ""Please, have a seat!""

""Good morning,"" I replied, already beginning to regret having opened the door. ""I'm already late for work, but maybe I'll take something to go."" I squinted around at the walls but found them blank except for a couple of generic art prints.  ""Got a menu?""

""Don't need one,"" she replied, already pulling a mug from behind the counter. ""We only serve black coffee, but it is a very, uh, unique blend.""

""I don't know,"" I said, smiling politely as I stepped backward towards the door. ""I'm more of a cream and sugar type of guy.""

""You don't need that!"" She nearly shouted throwing up her hands in a halting gesture as my fingers groped behind me for the doorknob. 

""Maybe another time. Have a nice-""

""Wait! Please!"" She cried, her voice shrill with desperation which she tried to cover with a hollow, humorless laugh. ""It's very smooth! Just try it! You'll see!"" 

Pity for this obviously struggling business owner was beginning to win out over my own good sense, so I approached the counter. ""Alright, Luci. Can I have it to-go, please? I'm late for work,"" I repeated, beginning to get annoyed as I watched her pour a steaming liquid into a chipped porcelain mug.

""No need!"" She exclaimed, shoving the mug towards me with a smile that was a bit too wide and toothy. ""It'll only take a second!""

I frowned as I looked at the dark liquid in the mug. It was black, alright. Not the rich, warm brown-black of every other coffee I'd ever seen, but a thick, inky black that more closely resembled oil. I took the mug by the handle and swirled the contents which coated the sides like thick paint. It certainly didn't smell like coffee, either. I wrinkled my nose at the smoky smell of charcoal and pushed the mug away. ""You know what... I'm gonna pass on that,"" I said as I turned away. ""Have a good one, though.""

""Wait! Please!"" She cried again, but I ignored her and continued towards the door. I only turned when her hands closed around my arm and she tried to physically pull me back inside with surprising strength for such a petite girl. 

""What the hell is wrong with you,"" I said, finally raising my voice as I wrenched my arm away from her clutching fingers.

""Please, you don't understand!"" She cried just before I slammed the door behind me.

""Crazy,"" I muttered to myself as I pulled my coat around me and hurried the few remaining blocks to my office building. Little did I know what an understatement that would turn out to be. 

...

""Hey, Cheryl. Good morning,"" I smiled as I passed the receptionist, a sweet older lady known for her ever growing collection of colorful cat-eye glasses. 

""Morning, Sam,"" she said, returning my smile as I made my way to the elevators.

""Have to go back and drink that coffee, Sam,"" she added cheerfully.

I stopped in my tracks and whirled around to face her. ""What did you say?"" I asked.

""Um... I said have a nice day?"" She said, looking at least as confused as I felt. 

""Oh, right. You, too,"" I said as I turned back toward the elevator. Must've imagined it.

The elevator was empty except for the quiet janitor leaning against his cart. The usual canned music was suddenly interrupted by a commercial. For coffee. ""When did they start running ads?"" I laughed, gesturing to the overhead speakers. 

The man, who had previously been fiddling with his phone glanced up at me and shrugged, but I got the distinct and uncomfortable impression that he didn't have the first idea what I was talking about. That notion was soon confirmed by the way he glanced at me over his shoulder as he got off on the floor below mine. Whatever. Just a coincidence. 

On my arrival to the office, I ducked past my boss's office and made a beeline for my cubicle. 

""Morning, guys,"" I said to my desk neighbors, Brian and Pete.  

""Morning,"" Pete said without looking up from the puzzle game he was playing on his phone. 

""Nice of you to finally join us,"" Pete grinned as he leaned back in his chair so far it looked like he might tip over. ""You know how we hate to suffer alone.""

""Least I'm not already taking a break,"" I said, gesturing at Brian who remained hunched over his screen scowling down at the kalediscope of candy graphics.

""He's been on break for, like, ten years at least,"" Pete chuckled. ""Right Bri Bri?""

""Don't call me that unless you wanna be called Pee Pee,"" Brian retorted without so much as moving anything but his thumbs.

I snorted with laughter at that. The banter went a long way towards reestablishing normalcy. I was already starting to forget about the strange beginning to my day. 

I opened my email and turned my attention to a message from an important client. The message started out normally enough, just a request for some adjustments to the usual weekly order, which I added into the flowsheet I'd send to the warehouse.  I almost didn't notice the post-script:

'P.S. You really should have drunk that coffee, Sam. You better go back before it's too late.'

""What the fuck,"" I said loud enough to garner the attention of the guys. 

""What's the matter?"" Pete asked. 

Brian actually put his phone down and peered around the divider, frowning. I moved to the side so he could see my computer screen.

""Am I losing it? What's this say?"" I asked him, pointing to the post script.

He scooted himself closer on his rolling chair and pushed his glasses up on his nose.

""Says, 'Good morning Samuel...'""

""Samuel,"" Pete chuckled next door. 

""Not that part,"" I said, ignoring the latter. ""Just the post script.""

Brian leaned forward more and squinted at the screen. ""Post script?"" 

""Right there,"" I said leaning in next to him, intending to point at the message, only to find that it was no longer there.

Brian blinked at me as he wheeled himself out of my cubicle.  ""You okay man?""

""He just needs to go back to Luci's and drink that coffee, right bud?"" Pete chimed in.

I stood up and peered over the divider at Pete, who seemed thoroughly engrossed in whatever he was typing. 

""Pete?""

""Yeah?"" He said without looking up.

""You say something just now?""

""Nope. Guess you really are losing it."" He said, eyes still fixated on his screen as his fingers flew over the keyboard.

I turned to see Brian still frowning at me from his chair. ""You sure you're alright, man?""

""Actually,"" I began, ""I'm not feeling so hot, I think I'm gonna head home. I'll see you guys tomorrow.""

I grabbed my coat off the back of my chair and shrugged into it as I headed towards the door before anyone had a chance to say anything else about -

""Make sure you go straight to Luci's,"" Brian's voice called out just before I shouldered the office door open. I didn't even bother looking back. 

And there was no way I was going back to that place. I didn't even take the same street on my walk back home.  So imagine my surprise when I tripped over a crack in the sidewalk and caught myself on a window of odd, black glass with shimmering red lettering. Guess I don't even have to tell you what it said. 

I spun away and speed-walked the rest of the way home without incident. I thought that perhaps I hadn't been sleeping well lately. Maybe if I just lay down for a while, maybe if I could get some sleep, I'd wake up and never hear about Luci's Cafe again.  Never even think about it, ideally. 

So, I headed to the bathroom to wash up and change before I lay down. When I twisted the faucet on, I jerked my hand away as if burned. The substance that  flowed from the tap was just as thick, oily and black as the coffee at Luci's. I squeezed my eyes shut against the vision, shook my head as if that could rid it of the memory. ""Not happening,"" I said out loud to no one. ""Not. Happening.""

When I finally gathered the courage to open my eyes, the water flowing in the sink was as clear as ever. There was not so much as a grey film in the basin. Still, I cut off the tap without washing my face. Maybe later. 

I plugged my phone in before slipping underneath the covers. It vibrated as it always does, but this time, the little notification bar along the bottom of the screen read 'go back, sam. 57 minutes until it's too late.' I closed my eyes and shook my head again, since that seemed to turn the tap water back into tap water a few minutes ago. When I peeked at the screen, it read, 'super fast charging. 57 minutes until full.'

""Jesus, I am really psyching myself out,"" I mumbled to the empty room. 

For several minutes, I laid in bed listening to the pounding of my own heart. 'Too late for what?' I thought over and over. I reached for the remote on my night stand. Perhaps a comedy would help get my mind off of-

""LUCI'S CAFE!"" The television speakers bellowed in a car salesman's thundering baritone. Although my fingers frantically smashed the power button, the screen continued to glow and promptly displayed a model leaning against a  brand new honda. She smiled and held out a steaming, chipped mug. ""We're waiting for you, Samuel,"" she grinned. Unable to tear my eyes away, I noticed that she bore a striking resemblance to the barista from ths morning. Although perhaps that was just the too-wide smile. 

I got up and uplugged the television, only to find that it continued to implore me to return to the coffee shop of horrors. I stood with my arms crossed and stared at te image on the screen: thick, ink-black liquid tumbling from a carafe into the chipped ceramic mug that never filled up. It did not look appetizing in the least. 

I stood in front of the rogue appliance in my boxers and stared at it with my arms crossed for several minutes. Finally, I made a decision. I picked it up and crossed the apartment and set it outside in the hallway. My elderly neighbor, who happened to be standing in the hall with a fistful of mail stared at me with her mouth open.

""Don't mind me Ms. Ellie,"" I said with a smile that I'm sure looked at least mildly deranged. ""Just taking out this piece of shit!"" I cackled and kicked the screen until the image of the never-full mug splintered into a kalediscope of never-full mugs. ""I never want to fucking see it ever again!""

""Sam?"" Ms. Ellie said, her soft voice quavering as her hands shook and her letters fell to the floor. I felt instantly guilty and took a step towards her, forgetting that was sweaty, disheveled and nearly naked. 

""I'm sorry, Ms. Ellie,"" I began. ""I've just had a really rough mor-""

""Maybe it would get better if you'd just fucking go back to Luci's instead of scaring old ladies in hallways you piece of shit!"" She shreiked before slamming the door to her apartment. 

I stood in the hallway between Ms. Ellie's abandoned mail and my ruined television shaking with laughter. I laughed until I thought I might vomit. I was still laughing and clutching my aching guts as I turned back toward my apartment. I wasn't even surprised to find that it was made of black glass, the name of the coffee shop smoldering in red. I laughed some more and wiped the tears from my eyes before heading inside.

Everything looked the same as it had this morning. The barista stood behind the counter, the chipped mug still sitting in front of her, still steaming as if I had only just left. I looked her right in the eye as I strode toward the counter. She smiled at me. 

""You win, Luci,"" I said as I picked up the mug and drained the contents in several long gulps. The barista smiled wider and I soon wished I'd savored the beverage. It didn't taste at all like coffee. It was delicious, sweet and earthy. It warmed my throat and belly pleasantly, like wine. The barista clapped and shrieked her gratitude. She ran around the counter and hugged me tight before running towards the door. 

""I'm free!"" She shouted. ""Free!"" And then she was gone.  I tried to follow and that's whe I learned Luci's first rule: I can't leave, not until I convince a customer to drink the coffee. I can step through the door, but I'm right back inside the cafe. 

I have learned several things since then. Luci is not the barista, as I assumed. Luci lives downstairs. He's  teaching me things. He talks to me all day, although I've never seen him. He just kind of puts the words into my head, you know? No. I guess you don't, at least, not yet.

 He says I'll learn the magic the barista used to get me here, eventually. But first, I have to learn to read the strange symbols his books are written in. Must've taken the old barista an eternity.

I would really prefer not to wait that long. Its boring as fuck here, if I'm being honest. Luci says I will live forever now and never age. Once I find my replacement, I'll be free to spend my eternal life as I please. He even provides you with a small fortune when you earn your freedom. Call it a severance package. 

It's not such a bad deal, really. 

Anyway, I'm glad I grabbed my phone before I left my apartment so I could tell this story and invite you to try this coffee for yourself, if you ever stumble upon the place. Which, now that it's in your head, you will. At least, that's what Luci says. ",3,1764706836.0,nosleep,1,0.67,False

True crime matters. People listen when you talk about true crime.

A little bit of background. I'm Claudia. I’m twenty-four, a theater major who wandered into a journalism workshop because ""narrative non-fiction"" sounded like an easy A and maybe a way to write better monologues. Instead, I got a forty-page syllabus, ethics codes, deadlines, and a professor who says ""lede"" like it’s holy scripture.

I wanted to hate it. I really did.

Somewhere between the lectures on structure and the deep dives into old features, I realized I liked it. I really liked it. It scratched a part that my theater girl brain never quite reached. The hunt. The way real life could be cut and arranged into scenes. The illusion that if you just ask enough questions, you can make something sharp and complete out of chaos.

For our final, Prof. Halperin told us to pick a cold case or unresolved mystery and build a ""multimedia deep dive"" around it: documents, interviews, audio. The more immersive, the better.

I opened my mouth before I could stop myself and called Zodiac.

People groaned. Someone muttered something about ""of course"". I didn’t care. I've been obsessed with the Zodiac killer since I was fifteen and fell into a Wikipedia hole at 3 am like every other anxious teen with Wi-Fi. The hood, the symbol, the letters with their stupid little jokes—it felt like a horror movie that refused to roll credits.

Also, I live in the Bay. I've been to some of those places. They’re just names on a bus schedule now, but if you say them out loud in the right company, people still flinch.

My roommate Sophie—also a theater major, always overscheduled and permanently sticky with stage makeup from our production of *Hair*—made a face at me after class. I love her. She wanted to know why I didn’t pick something ""fun"" like DB Cooper or the Patterson-Gimlin film. Something with missing money or blurry footage instead of actual bodies.

I told her it was perfect. Tapes, letters, creepy sketches, suspects for days. The original extended cinematic universe. She warned me not to turn into one of those true crime sleuths making conspiracy theories about Arthur Leigh Allen’s shoe size.

I promised I wouldn’t. I was already mentally choosing fonts.

Social media makes ""research"" look cute. That cute girl with a latte and the open laptop, fake reading in perfect lighting? Yeah. That’s not it.

Real research is fluorescents, dust, and your spine turning into a question mark over a microfilm machine.

Our campus library has a decent local archive. It also has a librarian who, when I said I was working on the Zodiac, paused just a fraction too long and said they “get a lot of requests.”

I joked I was surprised it wasn’t a major. She didn’t laugh.

I started with the basics: the letters, the police bulletins, the stuff every documentary drags out with dramatic music. The first time I saw the ciphers blown up on paper instead of a tiny JPEG on my phone, they made my teeth hurt.

You know the ones: circles, triangles, weird little boxes, backward letters. The 408 cipher a schoolteacher and his wife solved over a weekend. The later ones nobody’s cracked. They’re basically American pop culture now, slapped on t-shirts and podcast thumbnails.

Up close, though, they’re… ugly. Aggressive. The symbols don’t sit politely inside the little grid boxes; they crowd and lean into each other. Some have those tiny hooks at the ends, like the writer couldn’t quite lift the pen, like the motion wanted to keep going.

I traced a line of them in the air over the page, not actually touching because the librarian had warned me about ""oils from your skin"". My fingertip tingled anyway, the way your tongue does when you touch a battery.

That night I dreamed about handwriting.

Not words, just shapes. I was in our black-box theater, but instead of an audience there were rows of empty folding chairs. On each seat, a page of cipher. I knew, somehow, that my job was to read them out loud.

Not translate. Perform.

My mouth tried to make sounds that didn’t belong in any language I knew. My tongue felt too thick. Somewhere in the back row, something laughed. Not at me. Excited.

When I woke up, my nose was bleeding. Just a few drops on the pillowcase. Sophie saw it after her run and told me I needed to stop doing ""murder homework"" at 2 in the morning because my brain was leaking out. She asked if I was starting a Zodiac fan club. I told her not unless snacks were involved.

I didn’t tell her about the dream.

The next step was interviews. Halperin wanted at least three sources with ""direct connection"" to the case.

That’s hard when your case is older than your parents, but not impossible. We’re in the Bay; this story has roots everywhere.

I emailed everyone: retired cops, surviving family members, armchair sleuths who turned their obsession into a brand. Most never replied. A few gave polite 'no thank you's.

One reply came in at 2:17 in the morning from a retired Vallejo detective named \[REDACTED\] Larkin.

He said he didn’t do interviews about ""that"" anymore. Not for TV, not for podcasts, not for kids who treat it like a spooky legend. He told me if I was smart, I’d pick something else.

I stared at the email while the fridge hummed and Sophie sang something from *Hair* very badly in the shower. Then I wrote back that I wasn’t a kid and I wasn’t trying to turn it into a ghost story; I wanted to write about how we tell stories about violence, about the case as a narrative that eats its own tail. I promised I’d be respectful. Even twenty minutes of his time would help.

I hovered over send and caught my reflection in the dark monitor. Ink on my wrist, dark circles under my eyes. Behind me, in the screen’s reflection, the closet door stood open a crack.

There was something in the gap.

Tall. Blocky. Hooded.

I whipped around fast enough that my chair squealed. The closet was just clothes—my dresses on one side, Sophie’s seventies shirts and fringe and chaos on the other. No hood. No symbol.

When I looked back at the monitor, my reflection lagged a half-second. The closet door in the reflection was closed.

I told myself I was tired and hit send.

Larkin agreed to meet, but only on ""neutral ground"", which turned out to be a downtown diner that smelled like burnt coffee and sugar.

He had cop posture: back to the wall, eyes on the door. He recognized me immediately and said I walked like I was ""hitting marks"". I decided I liked him.

I'm not going to write out every word he said. That’s not what this is. But I’ll tell you the parts that matter.

He talked about inheriting Zodiac files, how it felt like being handed a cursed baton. He mentioned the usual suspect (Arthur Leigh Allen) and said if he had to put money on anyone, it’d probably be him, but that he’d seen too many men fit too many boxes. The symbol on the watch, the proximity, the timing—it all works, until it doesn’t. There’s DNA on the stamps that doesn’t match him, unless you believe he had someone else lick them.

What stuck with me wasn’t who he thought did it.

It was what he told me not to do.

He asked me if I’d ever read the letters out loud. I told him no, because I hadn't. Not awake, anyway.

He told me not to. He said there were patterns they couldn’t put in reports because they sounded crazy. Guys who worked the case too long got strange. One had what the department called a psychotic episode. One killed himself. A clerk who handled the letters developed night terrors about a man in a hood at the corner of his bed.

He said he thought words had weight. You put them in the right order, they become more than themselves. That’s why people love ""award-winning narrative"" and not bullet points.

Then he told me, very specifically: don’t read them out loud, don’t copy them by hand, don’t decide you’re going to be the one who cracks the secret message. Let it stay dead.

I asked him if he’d ever seen anything himself. His jaw locked. The interview was over.

He walked out so fast it was like I’d flipped a switch.

A few days later, my professor forwarded me an email from a local public radio station. They’d heard about the class project and wanted to let us dig through old reel-to-reel tapes: news segments, call-ins, anything Zodiac-adjacent. Perfect atmosphere for my piece, he said.

The building was ugly concrete, the kind of place that looks like it smells like toner. A grad-student intern with huge headphones walked me down to the archive: long room, metal shelves, rows of tapes, everything faintly humming with age.

He showed me how to work the player and left me with a paper log.

The first reel I picked was a 1969 newscast about Vallejo. Tinny male voice, lots of ""alleged"" and ""shocking violence"". The second was callers arguing about whether Zodiac was a hoax or one guy or government psy-ops.

The third was just a number with a scribble on the log: “UNKNOWN – poss. letter reading?”

I hit play.

At first: nothing but hiss. Then breathing, too close to the mic. A man’s voice came in, careful and slow, like an old radio announcer.

He said, ""At last you will listen"".

The man began to read.

It wasn’t one of the text letters. It was the first cipher—I recognized the pattern: three rows, eight columns, symbols like a drunk alien alphabet.

Only he wasn’t saying English words. Hell, he wasn’t speaking *any* language. He was making… sounds.

Clicks. Hisses. Little bursts that weren’t quite consonants, weren’t quite vowels. Some slid up into frequencies that made my teeth hurt.

The fluorescent lights over my head flickered. I told myself it was bad ballasts. I kept listening.

Under his voice, something scraped. Like a chair dragged slowly across concrete in another room.

My skin crawled. My heart was pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat.

When he reached the end of wherever line he was on, he laughed. It was wrong, like someone trying to imitate human amusement using sliders. Too high, then too low, warbling between both.

I slammed stop.

The room went still. The lights stopped flickering. The tape machine clicked as it came to rest.

On the far wall was a framed vintage poster under glass. In its reflection, over my shoulder, I saw someone standing behind me.

Tall. Shoulder-wide. A hood shaped almost like a cereal box covered in fabric. A white circle-and-cross right at chest level.

It looked exactly like the costume described by a surviving victim.

I turned around so hard I almost knocked the machine over.

Empty aisle. Metal shelves. Closed door.

I looked back at the glass. For a heartbeat, the hooded figure was still there, clearer now, like he’d leaned forward.

Then he wasn’t.

By the time Sophie got home from rehearsal that night, the kitchen table was buried in ciphers. I’d convinced the librarian to let me scan and enlarge them, and I was tracing the symbols with a fine-tip pen like I could soak them into my bones through repetition.

She walked in, took one look, and said, ""absolutely not"". She reminded me I’d promised no reading them out loud, no code-breaking in my free time.

I told her I wasn’t reading them. Technically true. I was *whispering.*

I said I was just trying to understand the structure “shape-wise.” She said my voice sounded calm but my eyeballs looked like they’d seen God.

She pointed out that I’d been forgetting to eat, that I hummed something weird in my sleep, that I’d written THIS IS THE ZODIAC SPEAKING on our grocery list in all caps.

I tried to laugh and say it was a joke. Even to my own ears, it sounded weak.

Behind her, in the dark kitchen window, I saw our reflections: two tired girls, a table full of Xeroxed murder.

And behind my reflected shoulder: him again. Hood. Symbol. Closer this time, the circle-cross faintly glowing like something catching a stage light.

My breath hitched. She started to turn to look and asked what I’d seen.

By the time she did, it was just our courtyard, glass and dark.

She told me, quietly, that she thought she saw someone too.

I didn’t sleep that night. When I finally drifted off just before dawn, I dreamed he was standing at the foot of my bed, exactly where she’d said her night terrors guy stood. Hood, symbol, nothing behind the eyeholes but layers of dark.

He lifted his hand and touched the tip of a pen to the center of my chest.

I woke up gasping, clutching at my sternum like there’d be a wound. There was nothing. Just a hot ache under the skin, like a bruise thinking about existing.

The deeper I dug, the less it felt like a case and the more it felt like a story that had been running since long before the 1960s and was just using that era as its most popular act.

Handwriting experts in old reports said the letters didn’t all look like the same person wrote them. Not just disguise, but different ""authorship qualities"", like someone consciously shifting style between each letter.

Some early suspects, people they eventually cleared, went on to have breakdowns. Psych issues. One of them was Arthur Leigh Allen. In a psych note I *shouldn’t* have had access to (the university’s sloppy), a doctor scribbled that Allen reported recurring dreams of a hooded figure with a circle-cross on his chest standing in the corner of his room. The doctor added there was no evidence Allen ever owned such an outfit.

I read that five times.

When I tried to tell Halperin that maybe the article wasn’t going to be about “who Zodiac was” but about how the idea of him infects people, he smiled and called it ""a very theater-major take"" (I found it both cute and mildly inconvenient). He told me to focus on what I could prove, that the dead shouldn’t be treated like props.

The 1890s came out of nowhere.

I was in the basement, scrolling microfilm of coverage from the 60s, when an older headline on the same reel caught my eye, probably misfiled.

1923: families murdered near Mare Island. Below a strange sign.

There was a blurry photo of a barn wall. Chalked on it, big and clumsy: a circle with a cross in the middle.

I went back. I found more.

1911: painter dead in his studio, same symbol on the floor.

1902: letters to an Oakland family defaced with ""occult, astrological signs"", including a circle-and-cross described almost exactly like the Zodiac one.

One anonymous 1911 letter to the editor talked about ""the fiend who walks under the sign of the circle-and-cross"". The phrasing made my skin crawl.

I must’ve looked spooked when I took the printouts back, because the librarian told me, a little too casually, that Special Collections had ""older materials"" on the symbol if I wanted ""context"".

Special Collections is basement-plus. Too bright, too controlled, full of heavy tables and white gloves. The librarian there said the circle-cross predates the 60s and brought me a thin, leather-bound book from 1896.

The title was *On the Influence of Celestial Characters in Ritual Language*, by one E. H. Pellham, 1896\*.\*

Somewhere in the middle was a woodcut of a circle with a cross through it. Cruder, but the same idea.

Underneath it, someone had written that this ""zodiac sign"" isn’t just a horoscope symbol; used in sequence with other characters and spoken ""according to hidden measure"", it calls down an Intelligence that ""walks under the mark of the circle-and-cross"" and ""moves from man to man as the stars move from house to house"".

The author called them ""zodiac ciphers"". He said they were living sentences, each set of symbols a kind of star-born thought that, once invited, doesn’t like to leave. He said the danger is less in seeing them than in repeating them. Less in sight than in breath. One line, from some older source he quoted, stuck in my head: the mark is not on the paper but upon the reader who knows it.

I should have stopped there.

I didn’t.

I copied the diagram. I copied the sentences. I justified it with academic language in my head—structure, context, draw connections between historical narratives—but the truth is, I just kept going because part of me wanted to see what would happen.

On the page of my notebook, the circle-cross seemed like it was tilting. Not physically. Just… wrong in my head. Like it was leaning toward me.

I stayed until my hand cramped. I didn’t realize how long I’d been there until Sophie texted, full caps, that she’d brought Wendy’s and I was disrespecting the fries.

I sent her a picture of the book and the symbol. She wrote back: ""ABSOLUTELY NOT, LEAVE THAT WHERE IT BELONGS AND GET YOUR BUTT HOME"".

I brought the feeling with me anyway.

The fight happened two days later.

I walked into our room to find Sophie in the middle of it. She was pissed, holding her *Hair* script like it was contaminated. She asked me if I thought this was funny.

Every page was covered in my handwriting.

Not notes. Not underlines.

The same line, over and over, in margins and between stage directions:

THIS IS THE ZODIAC

Sometimes ending with SPEAKING. Sometimes with I AM HERE.

“Soph, I didn’t—” I started, then stopped.

Because I had.

I remembered sitting on the couch, the script in my lap, pen in my hand, telling myself I’d just underline her cues. And then… nothing. A jump cut. Time gone.

She told me those were her only notes, that tech was coming, that I’d wrecked them. I told her I didn’t remember doing it.

She said I was scaring her.

That was the part that hurt. Because she was right. I was scaring me too. It felt like my hand and my brain had been divorced for the afternoon, like I’d been used as a printer.

She said either I stopped or she would go to Halperin and tell him something was wrong. She didn’t care if that meant my grade tanked. She cared whether I was losing my mind.

She left the script on my bed. I stared at the words on the cover. THIS IS THE ZODIAC.

I swear the letters looked... pleased.

The night I finished my first full draft, the bruise in my chest stopped aching.

Relief should have followed. It didn’t. It felt like having a warning alarm suddenly cut mid-scream.

My walls were covered in ciphers like manic wallpaper. My laptop screen glowed with paragraphs that moved in and out of my own voice—sometimes clinical, sometimes a little too… theatrical. Between the research and the timeline, sentences I didn’t remember typing had slipped in:

Maybe the Zodiac was never a man but a costume anyone could put on. Maybe the ciphers weren’t codes to be solved, but spells to be cast.

I told myself it was just the theater kid in me speaking. But I left them in.

I wrote about the headlines from the 60s and 70s, the earlier murders, the Pellham book, the idea of “zodiac ciphers” as living sentences. I wrote that the thing we call Zodiac didn’t start in the 60s. It’s older, patient, happy to wait and change masks.

I wrote that staring, copying, breath—those were the engine.

You don’t just solve a puzzle. You build a door.

I had one blank page left. Clean, white, waiting.

I’d been saving the Z340 for last. The unsolved celebrity of the ciphers. Reddit’s favorite chew toy. The one people have practically ruined their lives over trying to solve.

I dipped my pen.

My hand moved faster than I wanted it to.

As I wrote the symbols, the air in the room thickened, like humidity without heat. Shadows in the corners seemed to pool, like someone had deepened them with a brush.

The desk lamp felt wrong. The light wasn’t landing on the page; it bent around it, like the paper was the center of some invisible lens.

In the back of my mind, Larkin’s voice said: don’t read them out loud.

I didn’t.

I whispered.

The sounds came easy this time. My tongue knew where to go like it had been practicing without me. Clicks, hisses, sliding bits of not-language that still felt meaningful. My breath fogged in front of my lips like it was cold, even though the room was not.

Behind me, the floor creaked. Slow. Heavy. Step by step. Like someone was standing there, shifting their weight.

I kept writing.

When I drew the final symbol—the circle-and-cross—something in the air… aligned. The room didn’t shake. No thunder. It was smaller than that. It felt like a roomful of people inhaling together before a show starts.

Then a voice spoke.

Not out loud. Inside. Like it had been printed on the inside of my skull and someone finally flipped the ink visible.

*I am here.*

I turned around.

He was.

Not in the mirror. Not in a reflection. In my doorway.

The thing was boxy and almost stupid, like someone had stretched black fabric over a stack of cereal boxes. The symbol on his chest glowed softly, like it had its own backlight. The eyeholes were nothing but layered dark.

He didn’t feel like anger or hunger. He felt like attention. Focus. Being studied.

My body should have screamed. Fight, flight, something. Instead I felt… calm.

Theater brain kicked in first. It felt like stepping into a scene I’d rehearsed in my sleep.

I told him he wasn’t real. It came out of my mouth automatically.

In my head, layered voices answered: the tape voice, Larkin’s voice, newscasters, panicked callers, all of them braided together.

*You made me real.*

I asked who he was.

He didn’t say ""Zodiac"" straight out. He didn’t need to.

The symbol on his chest pulsed. He implied that names are masks, and humans love masks. I wear many—Claudia, student, actor, journalist. He’s worn plenty himself.

And then it hit me like a fast-cut montage.

Not memories. Not mine.

Glimpses.

Someone walking on a dark road in 1968, humming. A cab interior. A barn in 1923 with the circle chalked on the wall. A painter’s studio in 1911. A Victorian alley slick with… something.

Different hands. Different cities. Same hood. Same mark. Same moment, hovering in all of them like a chorus note: that slide from curiosity into fear.

I told him he possessed them.

He said they invited him. Every letter writer, every cryptography nerd, every cop who stayed late at his desk alone with the symbols, every podcast fan replaying the ciphers.

He said my research, my copying, my whispering, my article, my tape—all of that was me turning the knob.

Then he touched me with the pen.

Right in the center of my chest, where the dream bruise had been.

It was cold. Bone-cold. And then it wasn’t pressing on anything anymore; it was inside me, like the space behind my sternum wasn’t solid.

There was no pain, no blood, no breaking or tearing. No horror movie moment. Just this sensation of something slipping into a silence that had been waiting for it.

In my head, every cipher I’d looked at collapsed into one sound. A chord made of symbols. For a second I saw myself from above: small, hunched over a desk, eyes wide. Then that view folded inward, like a stage set being struck, until everything that was just me suddenly had more rooms in it.

He didn’t take over. Not exactly.

He layered on.

Like a transparent mask laid over my thoughts. I could feel him behind them, like an understudy who knows all the lines and is ready to step in whenever the lead falters.

Outside my room, Sophie’s door opened. She called my name and complained that I was talking to myself again and that it was three in the morning.

I turned toward the sound.

In the mirror on my dresser, my reflection lagged again. For one heartbeat, the hood looked back instead of my face. The symbol burned where my T-shirt should be. Then it snapped back. Just me. Hair a mess, ink on my hands.

My voice sounded normal when I apologized to her and told her I was just finishing the article. Maybe a little lower. Fuller. She told me to get some sleep and made another brittle joke about serial killer ghosts.

I smiled. My chest felt warm where the invisible mark sat.

When I whispered ""too late"", she didn’t hear it.

The next day I turned my draft in.

Halperin loved it. Said it was ""ambitious"" and ""a little theatrical, but in a good way"". He forwarded it to some podcast producer, who emailed back asking if I’d be willing to record a narration to go with the tape clips. She'd especially liked the ""mythos angle"".

Of course I said yes.

In the studio, they gave me big over-ear headphones and a mic that made me sound more like myself than I ever have in my own ears. My voice came through lower and smoother than I expected.

When we got to the section about the ciphers, the producer asked if I’d be okay reading some of the unsolved one. Just a few lines. They could distort it later for legal/""don’t freak out the fans"" reasons.

A week earlier, I would have hesitated. I would’ve seen Larkin’s face in that diner. I would’ve thought about Sophie holding her ruined script. I would have remembered the pen passing through my chest.

Instead, I smiled and said sure.

The paper in front of me had the cipher printed nice and clear, but I didn’t look at it.

The sounds are just… there now. Easy. Natural. They sit on my tongue like lines from a show you’ve been running for weeks.

We did three takes. On the last one, the lights in the sound booth flickered for a second, just like in the archive. No one commented. I’m starting to realize how much humans will ignore if you don’t name it out loud.

When I left the building, the city felt different.

Not louder. Not busier. Just full, the way a lung feels full.

Every person at the crosswalk, every car, every lit window—it all felt like marks on a stage diagram. Places to stand. Entrances. Exits. Like I could see invisible blocking lines painted under everyone’s feet.

Sophie called while I was waiting for the light.

She wanted to know how it had gone. I told her it was amazing, that they were going to air it next month. She called me a podcast star and said when I was done being haunted, I needed to help her deal with the director’s notes. She asked if I was okay because I sounded different.

I told her I just hadn’t slept. Promised I’d nap before rehearsal.

She said, ""You’re no good to me half-dead"".

I laughed.

If she heard the extra echo in it, the extra notes under my own voice, she didn’t say anything.

You probably clicked into this expecting a Reddit post made by some chick claiming to have finally solved the Zodiac case.

You want the neat version: I find a hidden confession, a stray hair, a photograph, something that finally pins it on one guy forever. Arthur Leigh Allen, probably. Maybe I exonerate him. Maybe I point to somebody else and hand you that sweet, narcotic feeling of closure.

That’s not the story I found. What I found is older and worse.

It doesn’t care who you think did it. It doesn’t care about suspects or timelines. It doesn’t even care that much about the bodies, if I’m honest.

It cares that you’re *reading this*.

What I found lives in ink and paper and hissy old tape and scanned PDFs and Reddit threads and comment sections and books from 1896 that nobody but weird grad students and cursed undergrads pull off the shelf. It uses attention the way we use oxygen.

Every time someone pores over those ciphers, tracing the symbols, thinking about them, whispering them, trying to be the one who finally cracks the code, it’s like knocking.

There wasn’t *a* Zodiac killer.

There were men who put the hood on, yes. In the 60s, and before that, too. Under different names. Different headlines. ""The fiend under the sign"". The circle-and-cross man. Whatever Pellham politely refused to spell out.

There were the people who never actually killed anyone but got close enough in their heads that something moved into the space behind their eyes anyway. The ones whose lives shrank down to letters and theories until something else was driving.

I know who Zodiac is now.

It’s the thing that watches you when you scroll past that symbol on your phone and tell yourself you’re not into true crime, you’re just curious. It’s the little shiver of pleasure you feel when you say ""we’ll never know"" but still read every new article. It’s the voice that tells you you’re smarter than the cops, that you’ll be the one to finally crack the cipher.

It’s the hood shape your brain fills in at the corner of your mirror in the dark.

There wasn’t one Zodiac. There were dozens.

And now there’s me.

I found the hood folded in the bottom drawer of my dresser, on top of old jazz tights. Black, heavy, stiff in a way fabric shouldn’t be. I don’t remember buying it or making it, hell I don’t remember ever owning it. But when I touched it, it warmed under my fingers like it recognized me.

Beneath it sat a gun and a box of bullets I had no memory of owning. I should’ve panicked but I didn’t. I just felt… aligned, like everything had finally snapped into place.

Lovers’ lanes in 2025? Please. Nobody parks under the stars anymore—they match in apps, meet in bathrooms, disappear between notifications. Good thing symbols travel just fine through screens.

Consider this my first letter.

1pcj7ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/complaints/comments/1pcj7ap/starbucks_and_other_businesses_cannot_pay_its/,Starbucks (and other businesses) cannot pay its employees a livable wage.,"**And** that is the paradox of the extractive business model behind Starbucks - there is little to no value left to squeeze from the same cup of coffee. It is not practical to raise wages beyond a certain point, or else it becomes financially unprofitable, no longer lucrative for the corporate structure, or too expensive for the consumer. Now, make no mistake, I am not defending the billionaire class. I am using this argument to undermine their supremacy, and fortunes. Their businesses now focus on expanding, not regenerating, or planting. There is no longer a reason to improve a product, or to retain existing customers. It is now more lucrative to acquire customers in a new market and keep them trapped in a pattern of buying their product through **subscriptions**, or by consolidating the competition around them.

Starbucks famously employs students, undergraduates, and graduates. The problem isn't the wages, it's the underutilization of human capital, and the organization of capital flow that shields the supremacy of the people who can mobilize that capital for establishing businesses and startups in the first place. In a better world, college graduates would be ethically absorbed into the automation ecosystem as a part of a great migration (supported by legislation) away from low-pay, labor-dependent jobs, and towards more technological roles despite any specialties. 

We simply cannot demand cheaper goods, and increased wages. We cannot demand CEOs be paid less, without corporations shrinking their workforces, and store footprints. The solution, I believe, is to integrate automation with livable wages. That means disinviting demand for Starbucks, McDonald's, Dunkin Donuts, etc. by slapping them with legislation that increases the cost of doing business, so that they have to lower their own. On the other side of that, it means cutting regulations for small businesses and expanding their access to startup capital through public-matching funds. 

The truth is that fast food chains compete for consumer dollars that would be better recycled back into hyper-local communities through small grocers, instead they disappear into the opacity of the corporate hierarchy inviting critique. Increasing wages is the temporary, literal answer. Transforming the culture of unconscious habits that make billionaires insanely rich is the deeper philosophical answer. True, Starbucks, and other businesses provide jobs, but these are low-skill dependent jobs that could be automated to save money and increase productivity.

1pcj608,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndhorrorstories/comments/1pcj608/dm_house_is_gross/,DM house is gross.,"So to start off I've been playing 5e with a DM at a local game store for a few months now and I enjoy the game, the world, the way he DMs, and look forward to it every week.
Recently though he has invited to another game at his friend's house where he will be a player and his friend will be the DM, cool, sounds good, I got time, i get the details and wait for the day to play. 

The day comes, now the location of the house isnt in the best part of town, like literally known for violent crime and poverty houseing. I use to live around there before and knew the area, so I wasn't to worried. I meet up with everyone, a group of 5 gents, some I know some I dont, no worries.

The house is a small ranch style, single floor, still has decor from Halloween up, whatever. We go through the door to an area that is clearly a converted garage to be part of the overall house, and the smell hits hard. 
Dank smell of dogs, cats, multiple dirty fish tanks, possibly mold and weed. The smell seem to let up as we moved from that area to the kitchen into the living room, but the amount of stuff that occupied the countertops itself isnt on hoarder level of stuff, but still there was something on nearly every inch of space even some stuff on the floor which was gross as well. Weed stuff on the counter next to kids toys and bowls.

Basically they had too much stuff for this small house. The couch was visibly dirty from dogs and cats and use. I thought ok, I've seen worse I can deal with it. Put on a brave face. So 6 men on various couches in a small area with a large coffee table, with a woman and child moving throughout periodically, little leg room. So we start the game.

Few minutes in the bong comes out, they start passing it around, omit myself from that, then the joint comes out omit myself again. The air becomes heavy quickly during this 5 hour long game (which i didn't know at the time, figured a 3 hour game), and with no air circulation in this area, it stayed that way for awhile. Prior to this meeting I didn't know anyone smoked or was going to smoke here, so I was blindsided about that. I mean hell, I thought at least you could go outside for that, there was a kid in the house. 

will admit they asked if this was going to bother me and I didn't want to bitch out and say yes, I mean I guess I was trying to be polite and not tell what a man can and cant do in his own home, but I hesitated and said I'm fine. I regret that. But already im uncomfortable in this place and now the air becomes uncomfortable. But I held out till we where done and when I tell you the fresh air out side never smelled better, it was amazing. I had to shower and clean my clothes once I got back home, it was that bad. 

But I dont really want to go back or even address these concerns to my DM friend, feel like the relationship will shift if I do. Good thing it only meets once a month. In my it makes sense that if you are going to have company over, clean up at least, accommodate your guests with a comfortable atmosphere. Tried to put this on AITA but they flagged me. But AITA??",10,1764706509.0,dndhorrorstories,5,0.82,False

I don’t know how to process this.","Hi everyone. I’m a f26, and I need some outside perspective because I feel emotionally overwhelmed and unsure if I’m overreacting. 

Yesterday, I invited my parents over for breakfast. Everything was calm and cozy in the beginning — we were talking about my recent trip to Bali, and I mentioned how kind and grateful the people there are, even though they don’t have much. My mom asked if we helped anyone financially, and I said we helped where we could.

Out of nowhere she shifted the whole conversation and told me that I never help her. She said I only think about myself, that I never help her financially, and brought up an example about a time I bought her some underwear she asked me for. She said that because I told her the price and she transferred me the money, I should have refused the payment and just given them to her. She basically said I should have shown “more humility,” whatever that means.

The whole atmosphere changed instantly. I got quiet because it hurt and confused me — it felt so unfair and unprovoked. She could see I was upset, and instead of calming down, she got angry that I was still sad about it after 5 minutes. She didn’t drink her coffee and basically stormed out the door, leaving me shocked and feeling small, guilty, and sick inside.

This kind of behavior from her isn’t new. I grew up with this. Suddenly turning on me, humiliating me, getting angry if I show emotions, making everything my fault. I’ve always had a more secure and calm relationship with my dad, so I was also sad that he just left with her because I had been looking forward to seeing him.

I called her many times and she didn’t pick up. She had a habit of “punishment” when she gets angry. Today, I called her again because I wanted to repair things. I didn’t blame her - I just apologized because I didn’t want the tension. The moment she picked up, she started scolding me again. She said I “kicked her out” yesterday because, in her mind, I should have stopped her from leaving. She expected me to physically stop her or beg her to stay. I froze yesterday because I went into shock, but she didn’t care, i tried to tell her my version but she didn’t care. She called me many bad names and kept going. 

While she was yelling today, I started having a panic attack. I couldn’t breathe, I was shaking, crying, saying “I’m sorry” over and over just to make her stop. She didn’t stop. Even after my panic attack, she kept scolding me. In the end we hang up. She has never seen me have a panic attack before - she doesn’t know I have anxiety. 

Now I’m left feeling emotionally drained, shaky, guilty, sad, and honestly a bit traumatized. My body feels like I’m still in that fear-state. I know this isn’t normal behavior, but I don’t know how to fully process it because this is how she has always been with me since childhood. I work as a social worker, because I don’t want children to grow up like I did. Now i’m even thinking of taking a sick day because i’m scared that this + work stress will end it a long term sick leave. 

I don’t want to cut her off, but I also don’t know how to keep myself safe emotionally when she behaves like this.

How do I deal with a mother who reacts like a child, punishes with guilt, rewrites reality, and doesn’t stop even when I’m having an actual panic attack?
And how do I calm my body after something like this?",3,1764706478.0,toxicparents,4,1.0,False

Anyone else hitting that mid-afternoon wall HARD these days? 😴 I swear, lately, my energy levels have been resembling a dial-up connection... slow and frustrating! And honestly, the thought of another cup of coffee makes my stomach churn.

So, I've been experimenting, and I wanted to share a few things that are actually helping me feel less like a sloth and more like… well, a slightly less-tired sloth, haha! Seriously though, small changes can make a big difference, right?

Here's what's been working for me:

*   **Hydration, Hydration, Hydration!** Seriously, are you drinking enough water? Dehydration is a HUGE energy zapper. I started carrying a water bottle everywhere and it’s a game changer. Who knew?!
*   **Move Your Body!** I know, I know... easier said than done. But even a 10-minute walk around the block works wonders. Think of it as shaking off the cobwebs instead of a grueling workout. Remember when we used to climb stairs and thought nothing of it? Now, it's a workout! 😂
*   **Power Naps (the RIGHT way):** Forget those hour-long snoozes that leave you feeling groggier than before. Aim for 20-30 minutes. It's like a mini reboot for your brain. Seriously!
*   **Mindful Eating:** I've noticed a HUGE difference when I ditch the sugary snacks and focus on whole, unprocessed foods. Think fruits, veggies, nuts...the good stuff! (okay, maybe a *little* dark chocolate too 😉)
*   **Sunlight!** Even on cloudy days, getting some natural light can help regulate your sleep-wake cycle. Open those blinds! Step outside for a few minutes! Feel that vitamin D flow!
*   **Small bursts of joy!** Listen to a favorite song. Read a few pages of that book you've been neglecting. Call a friend. Sometimes, just a little bit of joy can recharge your batteries more than you think.
*   **Setting small, achievable goals.** Instead of feeling overwhelmed with a huge project, break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Getting that small win really gives you a boost!

And speaking of feeling good... remember that inner strength we all possess? Sometimes we just need a little nudge to rediscover it. We believe in strongest people.

It's all a work in progress, right? I'm definitely not perfect. Some days, I still need that extra coffee (or two!). But incorporating these little things has made a noticeable difference.
