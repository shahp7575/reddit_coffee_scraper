I‚Äôm not promoting or selling anything ‚Äî I just want to understand what tools or features would actually be useful for small business owners in Tunisia.

I have small project in mind but need some guidance. 

I am using my vw caddy van for work, and from time to time I need additional power source. Also maybe I'll use it for Camping in the future. 

At the moment I'd need power mainly for some power tool chargers, maybe a chop saw 1300-1800w, potentially a coffee machine around 1500w.

My idea is to buy renogy 3000w power inverter, feed it directly from a car battery and use it only when car is turned on/using chargers on the move. That would be probably a cheaper temporary solution. 

Or, alternatively add 100Ah lifepo4 in between to work as a buffer?

I want a 3000w instead of 2000w because I know sooner or later I'll get a bigger van, and have bigger consumption needs. Also I am thinking about 100Ah only as I don't have unlimited budget. 

Is it a good approach? Can you help me deciding what would be best and economical too? 

Thank you ",1,1749326373.0,diyelectronics,0,1.0,False

1l5tpx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SacredSpirithood/comments/1l5tpx6/dad_said_thered_be_days_like_this/,Dad Said There‚Äôd Be Days Like This,"  
*A soft sermon for when everything feels like it‚Äôs slipping sideways*

Not every day is a breakthrough. Some days are just about surviving without saying something you‚Äôll regret, without texting someone who already showed you who they are, without spiraling so hard you forget that you‚Äôve already made it through worse. Some days are like wet socks, missed calls, and a card pull that makes you sigh loud enough to scare the dog.

And when that kind of day shows up‚Äîthe one where the vibes are off, your heart feels foggy, and nothing hits quite right‚ÄîI don‚Äôt always hear a saint or a scripture. I hear me. I hear *Dad said there‚Äôd be days like this.*

Because I did. And I do. And I will keep saying it.

I said there‚Äôd be days where nothing helps, not even the fancy candles. Days when the saints feel silent, the cards feel rude, and the coffee tastes like regret. Days when every blessing feels late, and every sign feels like it‚Äôs meant for someone else. I said there‚Äôd be days when you doubt the whole thing‚Äîyour path, your power, your people‚Äîand you wonder if the magic even works at all. And when that happens, I don‚Äôt want you to run. I want you to rest.

Because this *is* the work. This is the hard part nobody posts online. This is the moment between rituals when your faith has to be louder than your fear. In folk Catholicism, we believe God hides in the cracks‚Äîbetween the big moments, in the slow hours, in the days when nothing changes. That‚Äôs where your strength is tested. That‚Äôs where grace grows.

Tarot doesn‚Äôt lie about it either. You think the Fool has it easy? You think the Hermit doesn‚Äôt cry in his cave? You think the Star doesn‚Äôt come *after* the Tower? Baby, this path isn‚Äôt paved with glitter‚Äîit‚Äôs paved with grit. And still, we show up. Still, we light the candle. Still, we pull the cards and whisper, ‚Äúwhat now?‚Äù

So if today you feel like you‚Äôre the only one the universe forgot‚Äîsit down. Breathe. Cry if you need to. Then remember: Dad said there‚Äôd be days like this. Days that sting, days that stall, days that stretch your heart too far. But also days that will pass. Days that lead to joy. Days when the light returns.

You're not behind. You're not broken. You‚Äôre just becoming.

So light the damn candle. Make your grilled cheese. Cry to a song you pretend you don‚Äôt like. Then pull one card. Just one. You don‚Äôt need answers. You just need to remember you‚Äôre still here.

And I‚Äôll be here too‚Äîevery day, even the hard ones.

# ZAGG Privacy Screen: Best Options & Reviews [2025]

In today's increasingly connected world, privacy is paramount. Whether you're working on sensitive documents in a public space or simply want to keep your personal information safe from prying eyes, a privacy screen is an essential accessory for your smartphone or tablet. ZAGG, a leading provider of screen protection solutions, offers a range of privacy screens designed to safeguard your visual data. These screens utilize advanced technology to restrict the viewing angle, ensuring that only you can see what's on your device. Our comprehensive review will explore the best ZAGG privacy screen options available in 2025, highlighting their key features, benefits, and suitability for different user needs.

[[Explore Top Rated zagg privacy screen on Amazon.]](https://blog.rediys.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=zagg privacy screen)

## Key Features Analysis

The ZAGG privacy screen lineup boasts several advanced technologies and design implementations that translate to enhanced privacy. Let's delve into the specifics of what makes these screens stand out.**2-way privacy Filter:** This is the core technology behind ZAGG's privacy screens. The 2-way filter restricts the viewing angle of your device screen to approximately 60 degrees when viewed directly from the front. Anyone looking at your screen from the side will see a darkened or completely blacked-out display, effectively protecting your sensitive information. The filter is implemented through a meticulously designed micro-louver structure embedded within the screen protector.

The micro-louver technology consists of tiny vertical blinds oriented in a specific direction. These blinds allow light to pass through when viewed straight on, but block light and create a darkened appearance when viewed from oblique angles. The precision of this technology is essential to maintaining display clarity for the user while maximizing privacy for those around them.

**Impact Protection:** Many ZAGG privacy screens offer more than just privacy. They also provide significant impact protection to safeguard your device's delicate display from scratches, drops, and impacts. This is achieved using a multi-layered construction, incorporating materials such as tempered glass or high-quality PET film with an added layer of impact-resistant adhesive.

The impact protection layer helps absorb and dissipate energy from impacts,reducing the likelihood of cracks,chips,or shatters. ZAGG often uses materials with specific hardness ratings (e.g.,9H hardness),indicating their resistance to scratching from common objects such as keys,coins,and even knives.

**Anti-Glare Coating:** Reflections and glare can compromise both privacy and visibility, especially in brightly lit environments.ZAGG privacy screens often incorporate an anti-glare coating to minimize these distractions and improve screen clarity. This coating works by scattering incoming light, reducing the intensity of reflections and making it easier to see the screen content regardless of the ambient lighting conditions.

the anti-glare coating is typically a micro-textured surface applied to the outermost layer of the screen protector. This texture diffuses light, preventing it from bouncing directly back into the user's eyes. The effectiveness of the anti-glare coating can vary depending on the specific material and manufacturing process used.

**Smudge Resistance:** Fingerprints and smudges can quickly accumulate on a touchscreen device, obscuring the display and making it tough to see. ZAGG often utilizes an oleophobic coating to repel oils and reduce fingerprint visibility. This coating makes it easier to wipe away smudges and keep the screen looking clean and clear.

The oleophobic coating is a thin layer of material that has a low surface energy, causing oils and liquids to bead up and roll off the surface rather than spreading and adhering. This makes it easier to clean the screen and maintain its clarity.

**Easy Application:** Installing a screen protector can be a frustrating experience, but ZAGG aims to simplify the process with easy-to-use application tools and instructions. Many of their privacy screens come with an installation tray or alignment tools that help ensure proper placement and minimize the risk of bubbles or misalignment.

ZAGG's application process typically involves cleaning the screen, aligning the protector using the provided tools, and then gently pressing down to adhere it to the surface. The adhesive is designed to spread evenly and minimize the formation of air bubbles. Detailed instructions and video tutorials are frequently enough available online for added guidance.

## Core Benefits

ZAGG privacy screens offer many advantages beyond basic screen protection, making them a compelling investment for privacy-conscious users.

**Enhanced Data Security:** This is the primary benefit of a privacy screen. By limiting the viewing angle, it prevents visual hacking in public environments.If you frequently work with confidential data while commuting, in coffee shops, or at the airport, a ZAGG privacy screen significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized people seeing sensitive information. This can include financial details, personal communications, or confidential business documents.

**reduced Visual Distractions:** The darkened side views created by the privacy filter not only protect your information but also minimize visual distractions for those around you. This is especially useful in shared workspaces or during meetings where you want to focus on your device without drawing unwanted attention.

## FAQs Section

**Do ZAGG privacy screens affect screen clarity?**
While privacy filters inherently reduce brightness and can slightly alter color perception, ZAGG strives to minimize these effects. Modern ZAGG privacy screens are designed with high-transparency materials that allow for optimal screen clarity while maintaining effective privacy. users may need to increase screen brightness slightly to compensate for the dimming effect of the filter.

**Are ZAGG privacy screens compatible with touch sensitivity?**
Yes, ZAGG privacy screens are designed to be fully compatible with touchscreen functionality. They are thin enough to allow for accurate touch response and do not interfere with touch-based gestures or features. The surface coating also contributes to frictionless operation, allowing smooth interaction with the interface.

**How easy is it to remove a ZAGG privacy screen?**
ZAGG privacy screens can be removed relatively easily without leaving residue. Gentle heat from a hairdryer can soften the adhesive, making it easier to lift the screen from the edge. It is indeed recommended to use a plastic tool or fingernail to carefully peel the screen protector off the device, and gentle cloth can be used to wipe away any remaining residue.

This style table is almost impossible to find online. Clearly it was made in 1955 from the markings. If anyone has information on how I can research this table better that would be great.

I have only found a photo of this table and it was on both Facebook and Instagram from a little shop in Michigan and the table was sold last December and it looks in excellent shape in the pictures. It is the last photo. 

I‚Äôm wondering if the little rack was for a newspaper or small book? Thoughts? 

This table is the perfect footprint for my smallish living room with my contemporary furniture and some other mid-century modern pieces that I have in my home- not included in any of the photos.

1l5tm81,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l5tm81,London Trip Report - Standard Kings Cross and Park Hyatt River Thames,"**TLDR: The Standard London exceeded my expectations, while the Park Hyatt was a letdown.** The Standard was fun and has potential to be great as Hyatt integration evolves. PH is skippable and has a lower ceiling, given the poor location and generic hard product.

[See full list of all our Hyatt ratings here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11RFADQe-x8VROSnob6WiqKfGyuc0B2TqCeEZ3_uwW3A/pubhtml?gid=907112878&single=true)

# The Standard Kings Cross

**Overall Score: 15/20** (comparable to Unbound and Andaz we've stayed at)

Paid $350USD/night, booked the first day it was available on the system. Staff told us we were the first Globalists to stay with them through Hyatt. I was already familiar with The Standard brand but this was my first time personally staying at one. Booked a Cozy King Interior room (no windows) and was upgraded to a Deluxe King of Kings room (worth \~$90 extra/night). The brand feels distinct from other Hyatt brands but complements the portfolio well. **Still some kinks to iron out with the integration, but I would recommend The Standard London and would stay at The Standard in other cities.**

**Facilities 4/5:** Retro interior design is nice, especially the common spaces. Our room was immaculately clean, with no sign of wear. Beds were comfortable. Appreciated the pourover coffee in room. Multiple restaurants and bars on premise. Globalist breakfast buffet was very good and rooftop bar had great views. Rooftop bar was very busy on a weekend but we didn't hear any noise.

**Value 3/5:** No upcharge to book a cash rate through Hyatt compared to The Standard website. Points rates were available as a cat6. We booked on a cheaper night, but cash and points rates are on the higher side, given the small base sized rooms. Value is good for Globalists, due to the waived breakfast and upgrade to deluxe rooms from base, but I can see why guests find the value debatable.

**Location 5/5:** Excellent location, steps from Kings Cross and the underground. Hotel itself is a nightlife destination with DJs and locals on dates. Lots of restaurants, parks, restaurants nearby. Walked to British Museum, Postal Museum, Coal Drops Yard, Regents Canal. Appreciated that the neighborhood is a mix of locals and tourists on the weekend.

**Staff 3/5:** The staff was very friendly compared to other EU/London hotels and seemed excited about Hyatt, however they seemed unfamiliar with Hyatt benefits. No proactive Globalist recognition, and we had to ask for an upgrade and to remove breakfast from our bill (they honored both with no pushback after checking the system). If I didn't take Hyatt policies into consideration, staff score would be 4/5 so this score only has the potential to go up as they smooth out the Hyatt integration.

# Park Hyatt River Thames

**Overall Score: 14/20** (below avg compared to other 5 PH we've stayed at)

Paid 25k points + $400USD for 2 nights. Officially the worst Park Hyatt we've been to, right behind PH DC. It wasn't terrible (would give it a B-) but definitely didn't meet our expectations for a PH. Main issues are 1) location is out of the way, but 2) property isn't unique or nice enough to warrant the distance. The views are really carrying this hotel, and nothing else stood out. **Overall, just a very forgettable stay. Given all the Hyatts to choose from in London, I wouldn't recommend PH London to a friend.**

**Facilities 4/5:** Upgraded to Deluxe River View King. Rooms larger than most London hotels. Staff told us they have the biggest hotel pool in London. Pool was nice but nothing to write home about (no views from pool, no hot tub/sauna, locker room had dry sauna). Breakfast was good with Western and Asian options. The facilities were ok but nothing in particular stood out compared to other PH.

**Value 4/5:** At 25k points per night in an expensive city, it's decent value for a Park Hyatt. We paid $400USD one night and 25k points (vs $550USD) the other night.

**Location 2/5:** Bad location, especially compared to all the other London Hyatts. We walked to the Tate Britain but spent a lot of time leaving the neighborhood on the bus/tube. If you picked up this exact facility and moved it 3 miles over, it would be a gamechanger. Again, the views are really carrying this hotel but it's not a nice enough view to make up for the boring neighborhood.

**Staff 4/5:** Level of service is what I'd expect from PH. Attentive staff and good attention to detail. We had a housekeeping mishap and the service recovery was good.",4,1749326066.0,hyatt,1,0.83,False

All adults warned B to be cautios with trinket around A. So here comes the wierd behaivior. B place trinket on edge of coffe table near A. We told her not to do that. So B grab the trinket and starts walking aroud A with palm in A eyes level as if offering her to take the the thing.  All adults again warned B that could be dangerous. She just look at us and walk away. Few mins later she put trinket again on the edge of cofee table within the A reach. I ask B if she is doing it on purpous. She didnt response and take off to kids room.

Maybe some relevant details. B loves being the centre of attention. She loves to sing while standing on some platform in room full of people. She doesn't ming strange people either. She is the ""eyes on me"" kind but since today i never notice something malitious in her behaviour.

My question is: could it be some potetial risk in her behaviour or is this some normal kids boundary testing?

I have been experiencing heart palpitations and/or skipped beats for a little over a month now. I‚Äôve been more aware of them, but it does seem like it‚Äôs gotten worse. I‚Äôve had 3 terrible panic attacks directly due to this, two of them being directly after strength training/ exercise. My heart rate climbs to 145-160bpm even during bicep curls or workouts similar. It seemed as if the skipped beats were super persistent during these panic attacks (due to exercise or the panic?) but either way. It was almost as if I went into an arrhythmia or something. 

I would consider myself slightly above average in terms of physique and being able to exercise, but it seems to have gotten worse lately. 

I have also experienced:
-Terrible fatigue
-Chest tightness with trouble getting that deep breath
-brain fog
-some lightheadedness 

I have seen my doctor and even went to the ER due to this and of course the skipped beats stop when I have an EKG hooked up. I have had blood work done, CBC comprehensive and basic metabolic and everything came back normal. I have T4 tested on my thyroid and within range. 

I have also worn a Holter monitor for 5 days and pressed the event button even while at rest, multiple times. Due to a cycle of skipped beats (sometimes 3 within a minute)

I know that life stress, kids, sleep, and caffeine are all a factor and I am closely observing this. 

But these skipped beats are new to me. I‚Äôve been in overall good shape for a while now. Sometimes I fast and drink a little bit too much coffee, and workout, but I have dialed that back a lot lately. And my chest is still tight and hard to breathe at times. ",1,1749325818.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

It was unexpected but genuine‚Äîwe clicked really naturally, and I‚Äôm enjoying getting to know him.

Before anything happened, I checked in with two girlfriends to make sure there weren‚Äôt any unresolved feelings or overlaps. One of them (R) had matched with him on Tinder a while ago, went on one date with him, and they mutually decided to stay friends. She clearly said she was okay with me seeing him and has stayed consistent and respectful the entire time.

The other (we‚Äôll call her D) and I both first heard about him through R. I had jokingly comment that he seemed ‚Äúgood on paper‚Äù and that I‚Äôd date him, but I never reached out. D, however, looked him up, added him on LinkedIn, and later arranged to meet him for coffee (they work in same company). Still, she always said there was no romantic interest and that he was ‚Äúlike a brother.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt actually meet him in person until last Wednesday, literally our first interaction. We vibed naturally, and later that week I asked both girls if they were fine and both said ‚Äúyep‚Äù. So we went on 2 dates this week.

Since then, D has expressed that she thinks what I‚Äôm doing ‚Äúisn‚Äôt a good idea,‚Äù that I should consider R‚Äôs feelings, that I‚Äôm ‚Äúcreating potential drama,‚Äù and that out of ‚Äúgirl code,‚Äù she would never date someone a friend had been interested in. She also asked, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs 100 other guys, why this one?‚Äù And that she would never date him because he‚Äôs also friends with her ex now.

She‚Äôs also brought up concerns about the friend group dynamic, even though this isn‚Äôt a long-standing group‚Äîwe all only met recently. And I and the glue as I added everyone and actively hosting. She said she doesn‚Äôt want the group dynamic to change because of me dating him.

Meanwhile, she previously went with him to a beach trip and actively worked on building a connection, all while insisting he was just a friend who comes from the same country and that she enjoys relating to him on things back home. It‚Äôs confusing, and I‚Äôm feeling confused her mixed messages.

The connection I‚Äôve found with him feels respectful, honest, and natural. He‚Äôs been great with boundaries, and I‚Äôve communicated with both D and R with full transparency. I even re-checked in with R, who remains supportive and unbothered.

I‚Äôm now unsure, should I back off out of respect for D‚Äôs discomfort, even though I feel I‚Äôve handled everything openly and thoughtfully? Or is it okay to continue exploring a connection that feels genuinely good?

TL;DR: I met a guy through a friend group and checked in with two girlfriends before dating him. One matched with him and is fine. The other said she wasn‚Äôt interested, but is now uncomfortable and guilt-tripping me. Should I stop dating him?

1l5tdb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1l5tdb3/pricing_trouble/,Pricing Trouble,"Hello! I‚Äôm a consultant, roaster, and business owner, with about 12 years in specialty coffee. In the past year, I‚Äôve noticed a ton of smaller roasters and producers I‚Äôve worked with - some with plenty of customers - having to stop operations or make drastic changes. 

When I asked why, I repeatedly heard that the issue was financial. And when the price of coffee started to rise, their business model broke. When we dove in, most of the issues came back to pricing: some were pricing wayyyy higher than their coffee was worth (making it hard to capture new clients, and tons of inventory on hand), and some were selling at a loss. In both cases, everybody lost. 

So I spent a few months building a tool to help us roasters price more effectively and transparently, both on the buy & sell side. It has a super in depth calculator, news, and some other fun stuff, just to make the numbers part a little easier.

1l5tcn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1l5tcn1/review_of_wa_≈çsaka/,Review of WA ≈åsaka,"For reference, I‚Äôve stayed at many high end hotels, like St Regis, Ritz, SLH, WA, etc. 

The WA ≈åsaka is leagues above many other luxury hotels, including Conrad Osaka. Let me explain why I think this. 

First, as common in Japan, the level of service was phenomenal. Similar to Conrad‚Äôs in Japan, an employee is waiting for you at the elevator, and greeted me by name (by name didn‚Äôt happen at Conrad). 

I was upgraded to a suite several days in advance. The room is great. I saw someone complain that the beds were ‚Äútoo short‚Äù, but I‚Äôm 6‚Äô and had no issue, so honestly don‚Äôt know what that‚Äôs about. The beds are amazing actually, and don‚Äôt let you go‚Äî it‚Äôs hard to leave bc they‚Äôre so comfortable. The rooms have everything you‚Äôd want, and are super clean because the hotel is brand new. 

One special thing is that they have the most recent toto toilets that open automatically, and have an array of features like a dryer. 

Similar to Conrad‚Äôs, the pajamas provided are a nice touch, and this WA pajama felt more premium than Conrad‚Äôs. The turnout service is excellent, which slippers placed bedside, additional waters provided on each nightstand, and a special amenity changed daily. For example, one day it was chocolate, the next day it was an orange scented pillow spray. The front desk calls daily to ensure everything is to your satisfaction, and they will seriously try to accommodate any request you might have. The room also has light censors, so there is no master switch near the door. Simply close the door and they‚Äôll turn on or off depending on whether you‚Äôre coming or going. This was also super nice when walking into the bathroom at night, since it‚Äôs automatic. Cant beat the views of Osaka from floors 30-38 (or 37 can‚Äôt remember)

The food here is phenomenal. We did the afternoon tea at Peacock Alley. My only complaint about this was that the service is pretty slow. It‚Äôs great service, but not as well organized as it could be. For example, we waited 45 min just to received the tea we ordered. The hotel is new, and they‚Äôll figure this out, but it was annoying because we were thirsty. I wasn‚Äôt able to book Tskumi but I heard great things from other guests. 

The spa here is unreal. Not only are the facilities great, like a brand new sauna and steam room, but awesome Aesop toiletries, including face serums that I truly believe increased my skin quality while I was using them for the week. The stand out here is the sauna. Nice and even heat. Usually, the higher up you are in a sauna, the hotter it is and your feet usually feel room temp. Not here, the heat is well circulated, and it was a fantastic experience full of sweat, despite the temps capping out around 82 Celsius. 

I booked a 90 min ‚ÄúBody and Mind Hacker‚Äù massage. My therapist had hands of silk and it felt like 2 people were massaging me at the same time. I usually get a lot of massages regularly in the US, and the Japanese style is so different and great (I prefer it). 

The breakfast buffet really shines here. Top tier items, like Sea Bream Carpaccio, super fresh fruits, and even a variety of olives. The list of items is extensive, but everything here was top notch‚Äî also like Conrad, they have a menu of items made to order. We tried almost all of them. The coffee here was super good. I drink mine black, and it was strong! 

The pool is heated, has a great view, and wasn‚Äôt crowded at all. In fact, I forgot to mention this above, but every time I used the spa facilities, I had them all to myself. 

The parking/valet area is small, and this is actually great because a house taxi is always there and within a waves distance. To be sure, this is a regular taxi, and not the hotel‚Äôs car service‚Äî which is nice because it‚Äôs cheaper. 

The location isn‚Äôt bad depending on what you want to do, but be advised that some taxis had trouble finding the hotel because it‚Äôs new and not on their maps yet. You can avoid this problem by booking Ubers that route the destination for the drivers in advance. 

Overall, a fantastic hotel with amazing service, food, amenities and rooms. One of the best I‚Äôve ever been to (Conrad Algarve is my comparative- IYKYK). 

I was debating between this and Conrad ≈åsaka since this WA is new and unknown. Please do not hesitate to stay here, as the experience far exceeds Conrad ≈åsaka imo. 

Feel free to ask me anything else that I forgot to mention.

1l5tc91,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1l5tc91/25_years_old_with_concerning_kidney_function/,25 years old with concerning kidney function,"Hi all, I am a 25 year old female and otherwise healthy. I gave birth to my second child a month ago and upon having a CMP drawn a couple days ago discovered my creatinine is at 1.20, BUN is at 19, and eGFR is at 64 which is not great to see. In early 2024 my gfr was 110 talk about a significant decrease. I take lexapro and have for years but other than that have no medical issues. 

I am just wanting to know what in the world could cause such low kidney function at my age? Obviously I have a follow up appointment scheduled to discuss this but I am dying of anxiety over this in the meantime. 

For reference, I don‚Äôt smoke, don‚Äôt drink alcohol, consume average levels of caffeine through coffee (no energy drinks or anything). I did have a c section and a postpartum hemorrhage but was stabilized quickly and did not require a transfusion. 

Thank you for taking the time to read 

Sincerely, a very worried mom who wants to be healthy for her babies.

1l5t8uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1l5t8uh/review_four_seasons_tamarindo/,Review: Four Seasons Tamarindo,"**Where we went**:¬†Four Season Tamarindo

**When we went**:¬†February 2025, 1 week Saturday-Saturday

**Who went**: Couple (me & my husband)

\- Occasion: Husband‚Äôs 30th birthday and general vacation/relaxation travel

**Room type**: booked ‚ÄúBeach Room‚Äù, upgraded to ‚ÄúCliffside suite with infinity pool‚Äù

* We booked through Alex and got the normal FSPP perks (room upgrade as above, complimentary breakfast, $100 resort credit)
* Alex was able to secure this 2 category (!!) upgrade prior to us booking our trip. Normally we are a ‚Äúspend as little time in the room to enjoy resort amenities‚Äù type of couple, so our plan had been to book the most basic room. Alex secured the upgrade prior to arrival which persuaded us to go with the more expensive room
* I am *so happy* we listened to Alex. This is probably one of the first places we stayed where we were torn leaving our room every day. I‚Äôm still having difficulty deciding what was more beautiful, the resort or the room. Having the infinity pool and being cliffside made for the most amazing views and relaxing atmosphere

**Overview:**¬†

* I think this location is for people trying to get some R&R. We mostly just read / chilled by the pool or on the beach / enjoyed the gym and spa. If you are a foodie needing a different menu/restaurant every night, this is likely not the correct resort. It seemed like most of the guests we interacted with were from the West Coast / Cali and staying for 2-4 days.
* We will 100% return. It has been a couple months since our stay and I still dream about the property and our room. I wish I could have stayed for a month. I had never felt more relaxed and at peace at a resort. We just got back from the Dominican for a similar R&R trip and (while we enjoyed it) I kept wishing we were back at Tamarindo instead.
* Was very easy to find pool chairs (may have been the time of year). Does feel like many people likely hang out by their room pools so the main resort area is not too congested
* We do not have kids but I overheard a couple kids (5-10yo) telling their parents they wanted to leave the pool to go back to the Kids Club

**Property:**¬†

* I think this trip would have still been possible, but difficult, with any kind of physical limitations. There is a lot of walking (hilly, stairs, etc). There are definitely accommodations such as elevator / golf cart (but I feel like being 100% dependent on these would have made the resort less enjoyable since a large point of what we enjoyed was walking the property). The walk from our room was 0.35 miles down hill which was no big deal (we were never brave enough to take the walk back up the hill). There was only 1 morning we never got a reply on the room iPad about cart pickup and had to walk instead
* Beach rooms more walkable / closer to the main body of the hotel. But, there is not direct beach access from the room (the entrance to the beach is quite close, though)
* Tamarindo Beach: a short golf cart ride from the main hotel (the beach at the main hotel is not swimmable). This is where you will find beach activities (snorkel, kayak, long board, fishing). They have a full bar and food can be ordered (comes from ‚Äòroom service‚Äô).

**Rooms:**¬†

* **WOW**. That is all I can say. Unbelievably spacious room and bathroom + walk in closet. There was an outdoor and indoor shower also. I‚Äôm pretty sure it was larger than my first 2 apartments.
* Everything you would expect from a FS room in terms of quality and comfor

**Food:**¬†

* We loved the breakfast buffet and it was one of the highlights of the trip (good views, good food, what more could you ask for?). Great coffee/espresso drinks (but a tad slow on the coffee service and routinely would not receive until we were 50-75% of our way through the meal). The service while a bit slow was great and our waiter remembered our names and coffee orders
* Room service: The food was really not good / Four Seasons standard. It was edible but I would almost compare it to heating up left overs at home. The quesadilla and ice cream was decent. On a brighter note, my husband said the filet was the best room service steak he has had. But, the mashed potatoes were watery, the fries were soggy, etc. The beach menu also comes from the ‚Äòroom service‚Äô kitchen and was delicious, so I‚Äôm not sure where the disconnect was. We got room service x2 so it definitely wasn‚Äôt a one-off mistake.
* Pool service: What you would expect from the FS in terms of quality of service and food/drinks
* Dinner: We rotated between the 2 restaurants. It is a limited experience for ‚Äòfoodies‚Äô but the menu is large enough we ordered different things each night. We also did not chose this location for the ‚Äòfood experience‚Äô so we were satisfied
* Snacks: mini bar in the room. Only thing I‚Äôll remember for the future is to bring my own sour candies when we come again (the hotel is not really near any convenience stores and the mini bar is mostly chips/chocolate ‚Äî again just a personal note).

**Service:**

* This is definitely where we had most of our difficulties and things felt less ‚ÄúFour Seasons‚Äù
* We arrived to the hotel around 2:30 pm and were told our room would be ready shortly if we wanted to get lunch and our room would be ready after. We took our time with lunch and told it would be ‚Äú30 more minutes‚Äù until our room was ready. Long story short, we didn‚Äôt get into our room until 5pm. There was also a wedding going on so if they prioritized that I can understand. They also comped our lunch due to this. We were super understanding of this but I know there are people (even within my own family) that would have been infuriated. Once we got in the room there were also little things missing (the sink-side lotion/soap dispenser, shower body gel, beach bag etc) that we had to ask a couple of times to be brought to the room.
* Per usual, housekeeping itself was impeccable and the staff was super nice and accommodating
* Turn down service: Had very odd timing for turn down service, they would come anywhere from 6-9:30pm and some nights we turned them away since we were already getting ready for bed, etc. One night we planned to stay in and do Room Service / watch a movie, so placed a ‚ÄúDo not disturb‚Äù sign on the door. I got a message both on the iPad and a text message asking if the room attendant could enter for the turndown service despite the DND sign being in place. Again, a petty complaints but did not feel as smooth as other hotels.

**Extras & Activities:**

* Fitness: Very clean gym 1 floor under the lobby with treadmills, peloton, weight machine, TRX, free weights, etc. Small but nice. Very nice locker room / facilities. There is a paved path / road going all through the resort and allows for a nice running path. They do have a running guide (I did not use this but may have if I planned to run further into the actual reserve / outside of the trails going through the golf course) which they recommend as the trail does go into the ‚Äúwilderness‚Äù with animals such as snakes / boars etc. I stayed around the resort and easily could get in 5 or so miles
* There are tons of activities during the day ‚Äî we did the Reserve Tour (take you on a golf cart to all the best views on the property, <1 hour, highly recommend)
* Airport: We flew into Manzanillo airport which is very small (1 immigration area / line ‚Äî appeared to handle 1 plane at a time, fortunately we were the first of 2 planes to land so this went quickly. May have been 1+ hours if we had been on the 2nd plane; on departure there is 1 TSA line and terminal that took about \~5minutes to get to our gate after drop off)
* Transport: We used to Four Seasons provided transport. I saw a few other guests arrive by Taxi but I would 100% recommend using the hotel provided service. I can‚Äôt imagine the taxi was much cheaper. The road going to the hotel has lots of hills/twists & turns. I feel like I may have felt less safe with someone less familiar with the area. Pricing was also super reasonable (cost each way: 1150 MXN / $56 PP for shared transfer¬† OR 4600 MXN / $225 for private transfer). We did the shared transfer for \~$100 each way and had a private car both ways as I assume most other people arriving had booked a private transfer so there was no one to share with. Felt this was a great value for the \~50minute drive. Of note, I did see another post on here about car sicknesses during this drive. I can see how this might happen, so FYI.

I've been having ongoing shoulder pain for about 8 months. I have no idea what precipitated it (no traumatic event that I can think of). I thought rest from upper body strength training and physical therapy would help but it has not. I went to my local sports medicine clinic the other day and they did an ultrasound that showed high-grade tears in the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons. I don't know any measurements of the tears, only that they are more than 50%. The doctor said they are too big to be treated with PRP but too small to fix surgically (he is not an orthopedic surgeon, though). He recommended Microfragmented Adipose Tissue (MFAT) injections. He calls it a fat graft. Apparently the stem cells and platelets in this injection help promote healing and the fat acts as a matrix to keep the stem cells and platelets in place. This seems like a good alternative to surgery with minimal risk other than it costs $2000. I'd like to be able to get back to strength training and not having pain when I sleep and reach for my coffee cup. It's been frustrating to be sidelined by this injury. Two questions:

Has anyone had a fat graft and had success (or not) with that?

Basically I'm looking for a machine  that I'd use at events which could serve like 100 to 300 people. I've got a really tight budget for the time being. I appreciate the long term would be the need to invest into a more expensive machine but I don't have the capital for that yet so was trying to consider various options to start my venture.

If we say for arguments sake I had a budget for a silvia pro x, would you say that does the job? Or should I consider buying two gemilai owl - 1 for steaming and 1 for brewing since its a single boiler. Would you guys suggest any other setup. 

I guess my major concern is I need to reliably produce back to back for the event without hiccups and I'm thinking of just buying many budget machines and using them till they die and replacing them as that would still be cheaper (in the short term) than buying a la marzocco for example.

We‚Äôve built a good life together, and while we‚Äôve had the usual ups and downs, things have always felt solid between us. She‚Äôs someone who values her independence, has a lot of guy friends, and I‚Äôve never really had an issue with that, I trust her, and I‚Äôve never wanted to be the kind of partner who gets controlling or insecure. I, on the other hand, don‚Äôt have many female friends, probably 99% of my friends are guys. But about a year ago, something unexpected happened.

I was at a used bookstore, when I saw someone who quite literally made me stop in my tracks. She looked exactly like my sister. I was so taken aback that I kind of nervously introduced myself and eventually showed her a picture of my sister. She was stunned too. That was how we met.

To give some context: my sister took her life several years ago. We were extremely close, she was only a year younger than me, and we were best friends growing up. She confided in me about everything, and I genuinely believed I was there for her. But in the weeks before she passed, she started to withdraw. I didn‚Äôt push. I assumed she needed space. And then‚Ä¶ she was gone. I‚Äôve carried the guilt of that ever since, that I let her go quiet. That I wasn‚Äôt more present. My therapist tells me I didn‚Äôt abandon her, but I don‚Äôt always believe that.

Anyway, after that first meeting, this girl and I began talking more. We started running into each other at the bookstore, then grabbing coffee, then texting more regularly. Over time, we opened up to each other, about grief, mental health, fear, loneliness. She‚Äôs going through a lot herself, and maybe I felt drawn to her because I saw echoes of my sister, not just in how she looked, but in how much pain she hides behind a smile.

She‚Äôs become one of my best friends. I want to be there for her, not in some savior complex way, but because I couldn‚Äôt be there for my sister the way I should have. I don‚Äôt want to repeat that mistake. I don‚Äôt want to walk away from someone who clearly needs a friend.

I‚Äôve introduced her to my girlfriend. At first, things were fine. My girlfriend was polite, even friendly. But over time, she started getting uncomfortable with how close we are. She‚Äôs brought up the ‚Äúemotional intimacy,‚Äù and how I‚Äôm starting to prioritize my friend in ways that make her feel like she‚Äôs being sidelined. I‚Äôve tried to explain that it‚Äôs not romantic. There‚Äôs nothing inappropriate. It‚Äôs just important to me.

When she confronted me more directly about it, I told her I didn‚Äôt think it was fair. She has plenty of male friends, many of whom she‚Äôs close to. I‚Äôve never made it an issue. So why is it different when I finally form a deep friendship with a woman?

She says I‚Äôm letting my trauma dictate our relationship, that I‚Äôm choosing someone else over her. And maybe that‚Äôs how it looks. But to me, it feels like I‚Äôm just trying to make peace with the past, and not abandon someone who reminds me every day of the person I still miss.

So, it rained last night. My kids, filled with the kind of energy that can only come from cartoons and fruit snacks, ran outside the moment the clouds cleared. I swear, they were out there for maybe 45 seconds before the screaming started‚Äîthe dramatic, blood-curdling kind usually reserved for haunted houses and sibling betrayals.

They come barreling back inside yelling, ‚ÄúSNAKES! TWO SNAKES! FROM THE TREE!‚Äù And I? I transformed. No pants. No caffeine. Just me, a half-soggy sleep shirt, and a Swiffer mop. Instant warrior mode. I kicked open the side door like I was auditioning for The Walking Dead: Suburban Snake Edition.

And there they were. Two serpentine demons, clearly plotting the downfall of mankind, entwined like some kind of cursed friendship bracelet, lying in the grass. I charged like a sleep-deprived gladiator, flailing my Swiffer like it was Thor‚Äôs hammer‚Äîbut with way less effectiveness and much more static cling.

Meanwhile, my neighbor is standing calmly with his dog, watching what can only be described as an unhinged woman in a pajama top performing interpretive dance with a mop.

I‚Äôm yelling ‚ÄúSNAKESSSS!!!‚Äù like I‚Äôm in a low-budget action film, and he‚Äîbless him‚Äîhas the audacity to ask, ‚ÄúEverything okay over there?‚Äù

Sir. Do I look okay?

Anyway, after about five dramatic mop smashes, I realize‚Ä¶ nothing is moving. No angry hissing. No slithering. Just two very unbothered ‚Äúsnakes.‚Äù

So I squint (still no caffeine, mind you), lean in‚Ä¶ and right on cue, his dog trots over, grabs the ‚Äúsnakes,‚Äù and proudly returns to his owner.

My neighbor, now clearly trying not to laugh, says, ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ those are just my dog‚Äôs rope toys.‚Äù

She can‚Äôt drive, can‚Äôt go out and has had to stop helping care for my daughter, which was her lifes joy. She‚Äôs become deeply depressed and often says she feels like giving up.

She‚Äôs under the care of a consultant, but treatment so far feels like trial and error, lots of different medications (e.g. topiramate) and nose sprays (like Zomig), but she often experiences awful side effects that leave her completely strung out.

That‚Äôs Your Sign to Start Today,"I've helped a lot of students & early-career folks with job hunting, and one fear comes up all the time: **networking**. So many people are scared they'll say the wrong thing, or that their message will just get ignored.

Totally get it! I've been there too. But based on what I‚Äôve seen from job seekers who‚Äôve actually landed roles (including some who started with zero connections), here are some tips that really work:



**1. Start with a 15 min coffee chat**

Don‚Äôt overthink it. You‚Äôre not asking for a job. You‚Äôre just asking for 15 minutes to get to know the other person‚Äôs position. Most professionals remember what it felt like in the beginning, and they‚Äôre happy to help.

You can say something like, ‚ÄúHi \[name\], I‚Äôm currently studying \[major\] and exploring career paths in \[field\]. If you‚Äôd like to chat with me for 15 minutes, I‚Äôd love to hear about your experiences.‚Äù



**2. Build rapport: \~2 min**

Don‚Äôt jump right into the subject. Start by warming up with a friendly opening line:

‚ÄúHow are you doing today?‚Äù

‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre having a great week, thank you for your time!‚Äù

It‚Äôs a small thing, but it can create a relaxed atmosphere and make both parties feel more comfortable.



**3. Introduce yourself: 2-3 min**

Keep it brief and to the point. Think of it like your LinkedIn verbal summary.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm currently a Data Analytics student at \[school\] and I‚Äôm really interested in marketing analytics. I‚Äôve worked on projects with A/B testing and Tableau dashboards, and I‚Äôd love to learn more about what careers in this field really look like.‚Äù

Confidence comes from clarity of thought: if you know what you want, you‚Äôll be ten times more confident when you speak your mind.



**4. Ask two good questions: \~10 min**

This is where you learn. Try:

‚ÄúWhat do you like most (and least) about your job?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you get into this field?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you graduated today, what would you focus on?‚Äù

Avoid asking generic questions like ‚ÄúHow is your company?‚Äù Just try to show curiosity and depth.



**5. Follow up consistently**

Send a quick thank you note and ask if they‚Äôd like to stay in touch. That‚Äôs it. Relationships are developed through follow-up, not one-off chats.



**Tips:**

\- If you don't hearing back so far: Try alumni, smaller companies, or people who are 1-3 years ahead of you. They‚Äôre often more responsive than FAANG executives.

\- Feeling nervous all the time? Write a pitch and practice it with a friend before the actual chat.

\- Keep a spreadsheet of who you reached out to, when, and what you learned.

So if you‚Äôre afraid of networking, you‚Äôre not alone. I‚Äôve been there. Take the first step and you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised at where it leads.

Work started normally this morning and started with a nice coffee with my head chef. As I was making my rue for mac and cheese I started feeling really off.

My heart was racing, feeling dizzy, my arms and legs were tingling/numb. Felt like I was losing control of myself and going to faint. My first thoughts was am I having a heart attack right now üò≥ 

Ambulance were called and they took 10 minutes to arrive. My head chef was very worried because I had went so white and looked like I pass out.

The paramedics needed to help me walk to the ambulance van. My legs were like jelly and it was terrifying. Got into the ambulance took my vitals my blood pressure was abit high but to be expected same as my heart rate. Took my blood sugars they were normal and my oxygen levels were 100%. Paramedic said this could be a panic attack it can mimic symptoms of a heart attack. 

So they took me to hospital to get checked over. They took my blood and done ecg. All came back normal. 

They had checked all my vitals before I left 2 hour later heart rate 56bpm and bp was 123/64. So it‚Äôs pretty clear I had a panic attack. I‚Äôve never had one of these before and my god what a scary experience.

I‚Äôm not sure what caused it. I‚Äôve struggled with generalised anxiety disorder, depression and ocd for 2 years. Recently got told I had microscopic blood in my urine which in my head I expect the worse like bladder cancer or something. Even though a surgeon and doctor had said that‚Äôs very unlikely for 30 year old male like myself. But it‚Äôs been causing me stress. 

So I‚Äôm now starting to realise my mental health has came back with a vengeance because last year my medication and exercise quite literally got rid of all my mental health issues well 90% of the time. 

I have been under a lot of stress lately with work, bills and life and making sure the house and stuff is ready for baby when it comes in few months.

1l5surx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwipeHelper/comments/1l5surx/updated_pricing_for_the_top_pop_swipe_apps/,Updated pricing for the top pop swipe apps.,"Pulled up searches are not even accurate, why do we not have a updated chart for this? 

Stripping away all the other bs money grabs such as boosts and premiums, from what it's worth and actually proven, the *standard subscription is always the better compared to premium. Always get the standard, once it runs out, they'll tend to boost your profile for a month or two, then just reset and get another 6 month. 

6 months standard is still the best value. Unless you'd sit and swipe all day, 6 months standard is still the better deal. Don't bot the swipes, get a friend or paid assistant to swipe because their algos log finger-swipe activities.

I'll start..

**Hinge** (under matchgroup)
 
> Standard plan, 6 months - $24.99/mo = **$149.99** (up 60% from last year)
> 
> Summer 2025 offer - A laughable $22.49 ~~$44.99~~ for 1 month lol

**Coffee meets bagel** (not under matchgroup)

> Standard plan, 6 months - $20.00/mo = $119.99 ~~$210.00~~ (only app to have consistent 50%+ off for years)

**Bumble** (not under matchgroup)

> Standard plan, 6 months - $13.33/mo = $79.99 (seems to be the most affordable of all top apps but Tinder still beats it)

Right now you'd have a better time with apps not under matchgroup but the micro small ones are a waste of money, so something in the middlelike CMB and Bumble works better especially if you're a typical non tall model looking person.

I have no time for tinder their pricing is too confusing. Anyone care to fill in?",1,1749323999.0,SwipeHelper,1,1.0,False

1l5sufv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1l5sufv/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_has_feelings_for/,AITA for telling my boyfriend he has feelings for his ‚Äúfriend‚Äù?,"hello everyone, I have been having some thoughts about something that happened today and i‚Äôd like some feedback on what to do.

My boyfriend (23) and I (26f) have been dating for three years now. we‚Äôre pretty close and never really had a huge fight, so to speak. we have our ups and downs like everyone else but we‚Äôre pretty solid together and i‚Äôve never had reason to doubt him until today.

My boyfriend is a very sweet and emotionally aware guy so growing up he had always a few girl friends around that trusted him and his advices. Nancy is his ‚Äúchildhood friend‚Äù, the one he met on holiday when they were kids and met every summer. They went no contact two years ago when my bf told her that her current at the time bf wasn‚Äôt a great guy and she should be careful (he was a druggy). She took it as an insult and decided to block my bf and never spoke to him again.

Now, mind you, i‚Äôve never met her and my bf doesn‚Äôt really speak of her. I know, however, that his ex met Nancy and she was pretty jealous about their friendship, said she tried to allegedly kiss him during the one party they all attended for his 18th birthday (my bf says she was just affectionately drunk) and never really liked Nancy. At one point my bf confessed he had feelings for Nancy but that was before I came along, and he never spoke about her again.

Two days ago she texted him and asked to meet and catch up since she was coming to town for a few days. he agreed and told me he would go out for a coffee and a quick chat.

He went out this morning around 10am, and didn‚Äôt come home until 7pm. He barely texted me all day, just replied ‚Äúyes babe‚Äù to my texts asking if everything was okay.

when he got home he was pretty chill and super nice, and only when i burst out crying asking why he had basically ghosted me the whole day, he said he was sorry and didn‚Äôt realize how much time had passed. He said he and Nancy spent the whole day talking and lost track of time, said he was sorry and didn‚Äôt think much of it.

i crashed out and kinda yelled at him if there was something he wasn‚Äôt telling me and he replied ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt asked me anything‚Äù, so i told him that he was out all day (after telling me he would be out just for a coffee) and barely heard from him. He got upset and said he was sorry and now i feel like i overreacted and i broke our trust.

Now, i spent the whole day worrying about him and i‚Äôm just really hurt and confused, and my bf didn‚Äôt really do much to reassure me.

So, AITA? i don‚Äôt know what to do.",1,1749323971.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,3,0.67,False
1l5sty7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l5sty7/is_it_normal_for_a_family_member_stare_at_it_me/,Is it normal for a family member stare at it me for straight 30 seconds?,"Hi, I'm a teen. I recently moved away from my stepdad and now live with my cousins. I‚Äôm still not entirely sure, but I think my stepdad might have been grooming me. I used to think everything between us was platonic until someone pointed out that what we were doing wasn‚Äôt normal.

Anyway, back to the main point- I‚Äôm feeling uncomfortable around one of my male cousins. At first, he seemed totally normal. He‚Äôs kind, respectful, and my mom knows him well (they're only five years apart). He‚Äôs 27.

But lately, he's been staring at me- a lot. I ignored it at first, but I‚Äôve noticed it keeps happening. For example, the other day, he asked if I had eaten, and after I answered, he just stared at me silently for a long time. I even stared back, but he didn‚Äôt say a word. I eventually just looked away and went back to what I was doing.

There are also other things that feel off. Like, he‚Äôll change clothes in front of me in the living room after a shower. Recently, I think I heard him call me ‚Äúbabe,‚Äù when handing me a cup of mug and it really freaked me out, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure I heard it right.

So now I‚Äôm writing this because I honestly don‚Äôt know what to think. Am I just being delusional or overthinking it? Sometimes I doubt myself and wonder if I‚Äôm just making things up in my head.

What should I do? How do I stop freaking out or second-guessing myself? I want to keep acting normal around him, since we're kinda friends? Even though he's alot older than me. Except for all the things I've said in here, he's completely normal, and sweet, he always buy me coffee since he doesn't want me going out at night.

Mariah loves and respects her father; in return, Travis is a loving and supportive father. Mari usually consults him for advice whenever she's feeling indecisive or lost. Recently, Mari's been questioning her sexuality. After talking to her father, Mari feels more confident in steadily working out her feelings. Travis can also see through the Mist. This is how he was able to save Mitchell and help keep his children out of danger (for the most part).|
|Kendra Thompson|44|Travis' fianc√©e. She lives with the Bannings along with her daughter. Travis met her around the time he was appointed principal. He proposed to her a year ago, and they're patiently waiting for the right time to hold a wedding. Mari sees Kendra as a mother figure. Growing up, she didn't have a mother in her life. So when she met Kendra, it took time to warm up to her. These days, Mariah even calls Kendra ""Mom"", showing how far their relationship has developed.|
|Mitchell Bannings|15|Mariah's adopted younger brother, who's also a demigod. Mitchell isn't Travis' blood son. His father is Zelus, the Greek God of jealousy. Mitchell joined the Bannings family around the age of 5. Mitchell is her opposite in many ways. Where she's calm and rational, Mitchell is stubborn and impulsive. They butt heads often due to their difference in personality. However, the love they have for one another is evident. Mariah loathes her brother's impulsiveness, but she respects his competitive nature. Mitchell often inspires Mari when she doubts her abilities or decisions.|
|Naomi Thompson|12|Kendra's daughter. Naomi is like a little sister to Mariah. She tries to be a good role model for the girl, especially since Mitchell isn't always a good influence.|

# Personality:

Mariah tries to be a logical person. She's the type to put her feelings aside to do what's right (or what she believes is right). Unfortunately, this causes her emotions to be bottled up or cast aside at times. She rarely speaks her mind unless she's comfortable being around someone. Growing up with a temperamental sibling made Mariah a calmer person by nature. She's not easily angered and does her best to treat everyone fairly.

# Flaws

Fatal Flaw - TBD

Normal Flaws:

* Perfectionist: Mariah tries to achieve perfection whenever she does something. She'll redo a task repeatedly until she's satisfied with the results.
* Mari always needs to be politically correct when discussing things. This is because she doesn't like to speak her mind. She tends to avoid discussing topics where she has a bias.

# Backstory

*Birth:*

Mariah was born in Louisville, Kentucky. It was where Travis and Tyche fell for one another. The Goddess was intrigued by the mortal's ability to see through the Mist. Their brief but passionate relationship resulted in Mariah. Travis knew of Tyche's true identity by the time their daughter was born. He was unaware of the challenges that came with raising a demigod.

*Early Life:*

Mariah doesn't remember living in Kentucky. Travis relocated while she was still young. For the safety of his daughter, he moved often. Monters got too close at times, and other times, Travis was just being cautious. During one of these moves, the Bannings met a child named Mitchell. After helping out the boy, Travis adopted him. It's unknown if her father knew he was a demigod too. Regardless, Mariah welcomed Mitchell into the family. The two didn't always get along due to their personalities clashing often. Gaining a new member of the family didn't stop the Bannings from moving. They continued to move farther and farther east, until they reached Baltimore, Maryland. With high school fast approaching, Travis wanted Mariah to have a steady school life.

*The Daughter of Luck:*

Mariah encountered a monster after school in autumn last year. Things would have been bad if it weren't for Mitchell and the assistance of a satyr. Travis had kept his kids in the dark about their heritage before this day. Having no choice, he revealed all the information he knew about Mariah's mother. Mariah's reaction was to laugh at the truth. Some events she'd seen growing up made more sense now. The satyr who saved Mari proposed the idea of joining Camp Half-Blood. Mariah accepted the offer to learn more about her heritage. Under the guidance of the satyr, Mariah and her brother arrived at camp. She stayed at camp until last Christmas, She's been away from camp for 6 months. Having completed her semester for the year, she decided to return to camp. Her mortal life is stable, but she still has much to learn about being a demigod.

# Present Day:

Having been back from camp for a few days now, Mariah was getting re-adjusted to life at camp. She's missed out on a lot since her last camp visit. Her training suffered as a result of staying away from camp. Keeping that in mind, Mariah decided to do some research on archery. The girl exits her cabin with a book in her hand. After finding a good spot for reading, she sits down outside the Tyche cabin and begins to read her book.

{Feel free to introduce yourself as her friend/acquaintance since she's been to camp already. Or a stranger if you'd prefer that :) }",2,1749323918.0,CampHalfBloodRP,1,1.0,False
1l5sth3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/comments/1l5sth3/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_has_feelings_for/,AITA for telling my boyfriend he has feelings for his ‚Äúfriend‚Äù?,"hello everyone, I have been having some thoughts about something that happened today and i‚Äôd like some feedback on what to do.

My boyfriend (23) and I (26f) have been dating for three years now. we‚Äôre pretty close and never really had a huge fight, so to speak. we have our ups and downs like everyone else but we‚Äôre pretty solid together and i‚Äôve never had reason to doubt him until today.

My boyfriend is a very sweet and emotionally aware guy so growing up he had always a few girl friends around that trusted him and his advices. Nancy is his ‚Äúchildhood friend‚Äù, the one he met on holiday when they were kids and met every summer. They went no contact two years ago when my bf told her that her current at the time bf wasn‚Äôt a great guy and she should be careful (he was a druggy). She took it as an insult and decided to block my bf and never spoke to him again.

Now, mind you, i‚Äôve never met her and my bf doesn‚Äôt really speak of her. I know, however, that his ex met Nancy and she was pretty jealous about their friendship, said she tried to allegedly kiss him during the one party they all attended for his 18th birthday (my bf says she was just affectionately drunk) and never really liked Nancy. At one point my bf confessed he had feelings for Nancy but that was before I came along, and he never spoke about her again.

Two days ago she texted him and asked to meet and catch up since she was coming to town for a few days. he agreed and told me he would go out for a coffee and a quick chat.

He went out this morning around 10am, and didn‚Äôt come home until 7pm. He barely texted me all day, just replied ‚Äúyes babe‚Äù to my texts asking if everything was okay.

when he got home he was pretty chill and super nice, and only when i burst out crying asking why he had basically ghosted me the whole day, he said he was sorry and didn‚Äôt realize how much time had passed. He said he and Nancy spent the whole day talking and lost track of time, said he was sorry and didn‚Äôt think much of it.

i crashed out and kinda yelled at him if there was something he wasn‚Äôt telling me and he replied ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt asked me anything‚Äù, so i told him that he was out all day (after telling me he would be out just for a coffee) and barely heard from him. He got upset and said he was sorry and now i feel like i overreacted and i broke our trust.

Now, i spent the whole day worrying about him and i‚Äôm just really hurt and confused, and my bf didn‚Äôt really do much to reassure me.

So, AITH? i don‚Äôt know what to do.",24,1749323896.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,25,0.9,False

With the black jackets being revealed, the final five chefs were given an early taste of the likes of the clientele they‚Äôd be serving‚Ä¶

*River: ‚ÄúHoly shit, it‚Äôs Gaten Matarazzo!‚Äù*

With the black jackets being tasked to teach five of the brightest young stars to cook Ramsay‚Äôs famous lobster risotto. In a star studded challenge, it would ultimately come down to Aisha and Heather to determine which chef taught their pupil the best. In the end, it would be‚Ä¶

*Ramsay: ‚ÄúAisha.‚Äù*

Who would win the challenge, and be rewarded with a tour of the prize restaurant. While there, she finally got some closure and a new girlfriend in Heather.

*Aisha: ‚ÄúHow can this day be any better?!‚Äù*

Back in Hell‚Äôs Kitchen however, tragedy had struck, as River had come down with a heart condition, forcing the former frontrunner to withdraw. With only four chefs remaining however, Ramsay was not about to let them off easy, and tasked them with dinner service between the four of them.

*Ramsay: ‚ÄúI want to see who‚Äôs worthy of running that pass!‚Äù*

During dinner service, Aisha would impress on appetizers‚Ä¶

*Ramsay: ‚ÄúAisha, well done on the risotto!‚Äù*

Heather would show off on fish‚Ä¶

*Ramsay: ‚ÄúSalmon cooked perfectly Heather!‚Äù*

‚Ä¶and Drew would manage a very busy meat station‚Ä¶

*Ramsay: ‚ÄúDrew, keep up the effort, I want to see more of that!‚Äù*

However, Ted on garnish would struggle with communication‚Ä¶

*Heather: ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt be making these mistakes right now‚Ä¶‚Äù*

‚Ä¶forcing Ramsay to ask him a simple question‚Ä¶

*Ramsay: ‚ÄúAre you done?‚Äù*

*Ted: ‚ÄúNo chef!‚Äù*

*Ted: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going out on my first mediocre night!‚Äù*

With Ted managing to bounce back, the final four would manage to complete service, each of them earning their way to the pass.¬†

*Highlights of the final four are shown.*

Now with the chefs running the pass confirmed, which chefs will advance to the next level and get one step closer to winning that head chef position, and which chef will be left behind? Find out tonight, on Hell‚Äôs Kitchen‚Ä¶

**And now, the continuation of Hell‚Äôs Kitchen: Hollywood‚Ä¶**

As Ramsay bid them good night and the final four went upstairs, it was obvious that the gravity of the situation had just finally hit them; All four of them were just one service away from advancing to the finals. Heather said in her confessional that there were a lot of conflicting emotions running through her head right now, because on one hand, she was excited because the journey was nearly over, but on the other hand, this next performance was going to be one of their hardest yet for a variety of reasons, and the pressure involved was only part of it. As the chefs walked into the dorms, all of them sat down, all clearly coming down from the high that was their best service yet, and letting reality settle in.

After a bit of silence, it would be Aisha who would break the quiet, asking everyone if they thought they‚Äôd make it this far. Ted would admit that he didn‚Äôt, and said he had a feeling he‚Äôd do well, but not to the extent he felt like he could win. Heather would share similar sentiments, saying that she wasn‚Äôt sure if she was going to bond with anyone since she wasn‚Äôt exactly a people person, so it was why she focused on the competition first, but she was happy she got to know them. In her confessional, Heather said that being a part of Hell‚Äôs Kitchen was a huge deal for her not just because of the opportunity, but the fact she had come out of her shell and earned friends that she‚Äôd cherish, and she even got a girlfriend. Drew would meanwhile say that he only came to Hell‚Äôs Kitchen because he felt he needed to get back out there after his wife and daughter passed, much to the surprise of Aisha and Heather as this was their first time hearing of it. Drew said it was a year ago when they passed, and the time he‚Äôs spent in Hell‚Äôs Kitchen has brought a lot out of him, but everything he‚Äôs done he did with the intention of honoring his family‚Äôs memory. In his confessional, Drew said that he felt a lot of emotions throughout his time in Hell‚Äôs Kitchen, and he‚Äôs felt sad and angry, and he had to balance it out with a cocky side to keep himself under control, but being this close to the end made him remember what he was fighting for, and he didn‚Äôt see any reason to mask himself anymore. Heather and Aisha would express sympathy for him, before the chefs started to head to bed.

However, one chef was still out and about, and that chef was Ted. Unlike the rest of the remaining chefs, Ted had a night that was somewhat bad, and it was clear it was keeping him up. In his confessional, Ted said that for the first time in Hell‚Äôs Kitchen, he felt uncertain about his chances, and while he wanted to brush it off as having a random off night, especially since he didn‚Äôt get anything sent back, he did feel like he‚Äôs been having some off performances as of late. Ted continued to pace around until he was joined by Heather, who said she couldn‚Äôt sleep. The two would sit down together, where Ted would admit to Heather that after the last service, he was a bit worried because he felt like he shouldn‚Äôt be messing up at this point, and it was starting to get to him. In her confessional, Heather said that seeing Ted like this was super jarring to her, because she‚Äôs always viewed him as cool, calm, and collected, but added she could relate to him feeling down about a bad performance. Heather would tell Ted that tomorrow was another day, and she admitted that some of her performances sucked in the past, like that coffee steak, but if there was anything that kept her going, it was that it was going to be a new day, and that performance was not going to defy her. Ted would thank her for the talk, and the two would head to bed, ready to fight it out to see who would become the next head chef‚Ä¶

**Challenge**

The next day, the final four would head downstairs, ready for what was to be the final challenge before the top three were revealed. As they entered the kitchen however, they were surprised to see what looked to be a red-carpet shoot being held in the dining room. Seeing this, Heather said in her confessional it was like the first day all over again, only this time they weren‚Äôt on the red carpet, and Ramsay wasn‚Äôt disguised as one of the photographers. As the chefs started to move their way through the crowd of photographers and paparazzi, Drew said in his confessional that he was looking to see if he could identify anyone in that crowd, but all he was getting was flashing lights, unfamiliar faces, and a reminder that he really, really hated paparazzi. The chefs would manage to get through the crowd and up to Ramsay‚Äôs office, where Ramsay was waiting. Ramsay told them to line up, and as they did, Ramsay told them that as part of Hollywood life, it wouldn‚Äôt be only celebrities they would be feeding, but people like camera crew, tech guys, and, like the people down there, photographers. Ramsay then informed them that after a long time shooting, they were going to be hungry, so he was going to task them with making their own spin on comfort food. Once the photographers finish up, they would be sampling their dishes, and at the end, they‚Äôll choose the most outstanding dish. He finally told them that they had thirty minutes to prep, and thirty minutes to serve 30 portions. With that, Ramsay told them that they had 60 minutes, and their time started now.

The four chefs would scramble their way down the stairs and weave their way through the crowd of photographers. As they did so, Ted said in his confessional that the moment Ramsay said comfort food, he was thinking something filling and rich, something like pasta. Once in the kitchen, the chefs would get to work on their dishes, notably cooking in different kitchens. As Ted started to roll out some pasta, he said in his confessional that he was thinking of something classic, like spaghetti aglio e olio. Meanwhile, Drew was working on his own dish, and Sous Chef Jon would ask him what he was planning on making. Drew revealed he was planning on blurring the line between fine dining and comfort food, and he was going for gnocchi with gorgonzola cream sauce. In his confessional, Drew said that these photographers looked to be the type of guys to have an ego about them, so he was expecting them to want something high class, but also something filling, so it was why he was going for something a bit more complex.

Meanwhile in the red kitchen, both Aisha and Heather were hard at work with their dishes, and the two of them seemed to be thinking somewhat similar. Aisha would say in her confessional that her dish was something a bit more out of the box, as it was a tuna croquette, and while she knew that tuna was not the favorite of a lot of people she knew, she had a good feeling about this dish. Seeing her dish from afar, Heather would ask Aisha if she thought it was a good idea, to which Aisha said she had a good feeling about this. Meanwhile, Sous Chef Michelle would check in on Heather, asking her what she was planning with on her dish, and she revealed she was making a mini version of fish and chips. In her confessional, Heather revealed that fish and chips was a dish that was very special to her because she remembered eating this all the time with her dad, and it was the dish that kickstarted her love for cooking in the first place. As the chefs continued to cook, Drew would ask how anyone could concentrate on the flashing lights, before adding in his confessional that he was lucky he wasn‚Äôt epileptic, because if he was, he‚Äôd imagine he‚Äôd be on the floor right now. He‚Äôd also ask Ted how he was doing considering the distractions, to which Ted said at this point, he‚Äôs just blocked them out.

As Ramsay called out for time, the rest of the chefs would manage to get their portions brought up to the pass in time, and Ramsay would invite the guests to dig in. As they started to taste the dishes, Ted would say in his confessional that he‚Äôs seen enough Hell‚Äôs Kitchen to know that merely tasting your food wasn‚Äôt going to be enough wasn‚Äôt going to be enough to win the challenge, so what he had to do was put a little bit of that charisma to work. With that, Ted would animatedly talk to the customers, although Ramsay had to remind him to talk and serve, not just talk. Aisha and Drew also seemed to have a similar idea, with the latter saying in his confessional that he may not like paparazzi, but they did at the very least like his dish, so he had to work the crowd a little. However, one chef was struggling more than others, and that was Heather, as seen when she was mainly explaining the dish with a somewhat dry tone. In her confessional, Heather admitted she‚Äôs never been great with crowds of people, and it‚Äôs why she was far more used to working inside the kitchen than doing stuff like being a waitress, and how she was much more at home over the stove-top than interacting face-to-face with a human being. In spite of her socialization issues, it seemed that the photographers liked Heather‚Äôs dish.

As the chefs continued to serve their guests, Ramsay would be heading around the restaurant to ask the photographers their favorite dishes. One of the men that Ramsay asked said his favorite dish belonged to Ted, as he loved something that was simple, but also had a bit of a kick to it. Another photographer said her favorite was Drew‚Äôs, saying that she loved the cream sauce and the gnocchi itself was cooked perfectly. Back at the pass, Heather and Aisha had finished serving their portions and were watching the guests eat, when Heather asked how Aisha thought she did. Aisha said she felt she did fine, and added in her confessional that no matter what happened, the fact she got to be this far in the competition meant she felt like a winner.¬†

After thirty minutes, Ramsay would gather the final four, telling them that the results were in. Starting from reverse order, Ramsay announced that the dish that received the least number of votes with only 20% belonged to‚Ä¶Aisha. Aisha seemed a little bummed out at this, but a quick pat on the back from Heather would cheer her up. Ramsay announced that in third place with an overall percentage of 25% of the votes was‚Ä¶Heather, who didn‚Äôt really seem fazed that much. With that, Ramsay announced that it was down to Drew and Ted for who had the best dish, and the crowd cheered as he revealed that. Ramsay would finally reveal that with 29% of the vote, the winning dish belonged to‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶Drew, much to his elation. As he celebrated, he said in his confessional that he actually was pretty shocked he won, especially considering he was on his A-game once more, before finally adding that maybe he didn‚Äôt hate paparazzi that much.¬†

**Reward / Punishment**

Ramsay would congratulate Drew on winning the challenge, and announced that the reward he had won was incredible. In fact, it was so incredible that he felt it shouldn‚Äôt be experienced alone, and asked Drew who he‚Äôd like to take with him. Drew thought for a moment, saying in his confessional that this choice was so tough because getting some info on someone like Heather or Aisha, especially considering how dominant they‚Äôve been was an almost necessity, but on the other hand, Ted‚Äôs been his closest friend, and he was the runner-up. After a bit of deliberation, Drew announced that he was going to take Ted, to which Ted said in his confessional that he really appreciated Drew picking him, as the loss of the challenge after coming so close kind of hit him a bit, so maybe getting out was what he needed. Ramsay announced that for the two of them, they‚Äôd be spending a day at the beach in Malibu, and not only that, but they‚Äôd be on horseback. Ramsay told them to head back to the dorms and get ready, and the two would head off. Turning his attention back to Heather and Aisha, Ramsay informed them that they were going to be on bar duty tonight, as they had a shipment of crates filled with limes, oranges, lemons, and many more fruits, and they needed to be washed, peeled, and zested for the bartender that night. With that, Ramsay told them to head up to the patio, and as they did so, Heather said in her confessional that being a part of a punishment sucked, but at least it was bar duty, something she‚Äôs done back then, so it shouldn‚Äôt be any big deal.

Heather and Aisha would soon be called down to the kitchen and started getting to work on the fruits. As they did so, Aisha said in her confessional that she hasn‚Äôt complained much, but this punishment was probably the worst so far because there were so many steps to doing this, and the worst part was how tedious it was. As the punishment dragged on and on, Aisha would ask Heather why she‚Äôs never had a girlfriend before, to which Heather said she didn‚Äôt because she found the idea hard to balance, especially when it came to her desire to be a world class chef. Aisha asked if she ever felt lonely, and Heather admitted that sometimes, she felt lonely, but for the longest time she brushed it off as if it were a requirement to get far. In her confessional, Heather said that she understood the risks of wanting to be a chef, but she knew from experience how hard it was to be a woman in the industry, so it meant sacrifices had to be made. Aisha told her she reminded her a lot of someone like Andi, one of the old sous chefs, and Heather revealed that Andi was an inspiration to her, and wanted to follow her example. Heather would then admit in her confessional that initially she wanted to wait until she was around thirty so she could settle down, but being in Hell‚Äôs Kitchen kind of made her appreciate the idea of having friends and relationships, so even if she didn‚Äôt win, she‚Äôs going to have a new outlook on life.

Meanwhile, Ted and Drew were trotting along on horses along the coastline of Malibu Beach, where Drew said he never expected to be riding a horse on the beaches of Malibu, and Ted would agree. In his confessional, Ted said that being a guy in Kansas, he was more than a little familiar with horses, but he had to admit that it was a bit jarring to be riding on the beach considering that beaches were not exactly something he was familiar with. As the two continued to trot along, Drew would ask Ted if they had this sort of thing in Kansas, to which Ted said that they did not, and he‚Äôs actually never seen a beach before, and he didn‚Äôt count those lakes back home. Drew admittedly he‚Äôs never been horseback riding before, so it was a new experience for the both of them. The two of them would then get a sudden surprise, as waiting for them was a lunch platter for the two of them. Sitting down, Drew said in his confessional that he wasn‚Äôt the type to get really sappy, especially over someone he‚Äôs met a few weeks ago, but he was super glad to be sharing this with Ted since he‚Äôs been pretty much his best friend since arriving here. Drew would ask Ted if he ever thought about the other chefs who were here, mainly the ones on the blue team. In response, Ted said he remembered the first day, and already he was picking out the chefs who he felt he could rely on, and the ones not a part of that list were Ira, Julian, and Joey. In his confessional, Ted said he‚Äôs always felt like he had a really good read on people, and the fact that the three of them happened to be right on the mark when it came to his own predictions, only justified it. Hearing this, Drew asked Ted what he thought of him the first day, to which Ted said he seemed a bit cocky, but overall competent, which satisfied Drew. The two of them would continue to eat their lunch, with Drew in his confessional saying that there‚Äôs been a lot of struggles to get to this point, but by the end of it all, he was going to give it his all.

**Pre-Service**

Eventually, Drew and Ted returned to Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and would join the others in starting to prep for what was to be, up to this point, their most important service yet. To hammer this in, Ramsay would pop in and tell everyone to line up. Once they did, Ramsay told the final four that tonight, he was giving them control of the kitchen, and having them each take their turn running the pass. Ramsay would also remind the chefs that he saw incredible leadership displayed from all four of them at some point in the competition, but what he really wanted to see was who could run the kitchen, and he was looking for them to own their standards, and run the kitchen with confidence. With that, Ramsay had them continue to prep.¬†

In the final black jacket service, Heather was prepping appetizers, Drew was prepping garnish, Aisha was prepping fish, and Ted was setting up meat. The chefs would work smoothly together, their bond making sure that nothing would be delayed before service. However, Ted would note in his confessional that there was a lot of tension in the air because this was it, this was the service that would prove everything, and it was essentially their last chance to show why they should be that head chef. With everyone focused on their tasks, prep was completed, and Ramsay told Marino to open Hell‚Äôs Kitchen.

**Dinner Service**

For the final time in the black jacket phase, guests poured into Hell‚Äôs Kitchen, eager to see which of the final four chefs would advance into the finals. With a crowd of high-class guests entering the dining room like Bryan Cranston and Ryan Reynolds, it wasn‚Äôt long before orders started to make their way into the kitchen. As the night started, Ramsay called out the first ticket of appetizers, and looked to Heather, Drew, and Aisha to communicate with each other. The three of them talked together, and with their strong communication, they would quickly send their first appetizers and scallops out of the kitchen with no issues. Now that the kitchen had settled down, Ramsay told Heather to let Sous Chef Michelle take over the appetizers station so she could run the pass.

As Heather took Ramsay‚Äôs place on the hot plate, Ramsay reminded her that she was the one in control, and he‚Äôs seen her lock in when needed, so he wanted to see that focused energy from her tonight. In her confessional, Heather said that running the pass was something she was looking forward to all season, because being an executive chef meant she knew what it was like calling the shots, so she was ready to do as Ramsay said and lock in. As Heather got her first ticket, she would call out the order with confidence, and with her guidance, appetizers would continue to leave the kitchen at a steady pace. However, unbeknownst to her, her first sabotage was on the way as the risotto being sent up to the pass had orzo instead of rice. Heather would start to plate it without thinking, leading to Ramsay telling her to stop and pulling her aside to tell her it was orzo, and reminded her she had to taste everything. In her confessional, Heather said it was a dumb mistake on her end, and she wasn‚Äôt sure why she decided to just put it on, but whatever the case, she wasn‚Äôt making that mistake again. Regardless of that mistake, Heather would still manage to get appetizers moving, but her next sabotage was on the way, as Michelle had replaced the lobster in the lobster risotto with shrimp. The plate didn‚Äôt even get to the pass this time however before Heather noticed it and asked for lobster in the risotto instead of shrimp, and Ramsay congratulated her for spotting it that quickly. In her confessional, Heather said that she loved shrimp growing up, and she could probably recognize it just from a cell at this point. Heather continued to lead strong and even sent back scallops that were seared on one side by Aisha, and told her to remember both sides. Aisha would say in her confessional that Heather seemed to have struck this balance between running the pass as herself and running the pass as Ramsay, because she was lowkey worried on how bad things could‚Äôve gotten if the two weren‚Äôt about to go on a date and she made that error then. Soon after, Heather‚Äôs third sabotage was on the way, as Michelle was replacing the mussels in the capellini with clam. Heather would taste, and ask Michelle for mussels. Ramsay praised her for catching that, and a few moments later, told her to return to her section, then called up Drew to run the pass next.¬†

Ramsay told Drew that he couldn‚Äôt let the brigade run him, and that he was looking for him to prove why he should belong here. As Drew got underway, he called out the first few orders with authority, saying in his confessional that tonight, everyone proved at some point that they should lead, so he was looking to show why he was the best leader. With Drew‚Äôs strong leadership, he would have appetizers leaving the kitchen, but his first sabotage was on the way as Michelle would bring up scallops that were only cooked on one side. Drew was able to catch this right away and reminded Michelle that they needed to be cooked on both sides, and Ramsay praised him for the attention to detail. In his confessional, Drew jokingly thanked Aisha for not cooking those scallops on both sides earlier, because it only reminded him to do that. Drew‚Äôs strong leadership eventually allowed the kitchen to progress to entrees. For the first ticket, Drew called out the ticket with a strong voice, keeping the flow of the kitchen going. However, his next sabotage was on the way, as Ramsay swapped out the mash for cauliflower puree. Drew would quickly catch it, and asked for mash, earning Ramsay‚Äôs praise once more. As another set of entrees came up, Drew would note that Ted‚Äôs striploin was medium when it was supposed to be medium rare, and told Ted to get another one on. Noticing that Ted didn‚Äôt have a backup, Drew asked in his confessional what the hell was up with Ted, because he‚Äôs been making these silly mistakes and he couldn‚Äôt be making them at this point. Ted said he‚Äôd have his striploin ready in seven minutes, but Drew told him to make it six. Ted‚Äôs refire was fortunately accepted, but Drew‚Äôs next sabotage was on its way, where Ramsay was replacing the scallops with king oyster mushrooms. Once more, Drew would quickly catch it much to Ramsay‚Äôs praise, and he told him to get back to his section, before calling up Aisha to run the pass. Drew would say in his confessional that he was proud of his time on the pass, as he caught everything, and he was sure he was bound to move onto the finals

As Aisha got up to the pass, Ramsay told her that he saw how she could lead, so he was expecting her to keep the momentum going from this point on. Aisha would quickly start calling out tickets, making sure that everyone heard what was going, and said in her confessional that her at the start of the season would crumble under the pressure, but with the hot streak she‚Äôs been on lately, she felt confident in herself. With Aisha‚Äôs leadership, as well as Ted and Drew sending out perfect wellingtons and garnish respectively, entrees would run smoothly, but Aisha‚Äôs first sabotage was on the way. Not only that, but it was in her hand, as Marino handed Aisha a four-top when there were three entrees on there. Aisha wound up reading it, and Ramsay asked her if that made sense, which made Aisha realize her mistake. In her confessional, she admitted that she was more used to tasting food for sabotages rather than reading. In spite of that mishap, Aisha would continue to keep entrees running, and as Heather served perfect salmon and Ted served perfect lamb. However, her next sabotage was on the way, as Michelle had hidden a duck breast among the chicken. Aisha inspected carefully, and she would manage to identify the duck breast much to Ramsay‚Äôs praise. In her confessional, Aisha said she was happy to have gotten at least one sabotage right so far, and she was getting a little giddy. Her next sabotage was on it‚Äôs way soon after, as Ramsay replaced the lamb with veal. Aisha would once more carefully inspect, leading to Ted saying in his confessional that Aisha‚Äôs been taking a lot of time to inspect the food, and while it was a good idea, it also meant she ran the risk of food getting cold. Fortunately, Aisha managed to spot the veal, and asked for lamb. Ramsay praised her for that and told her to head back to her section and called up Ted to run the pass. Aisha would say in her confessional that she started off a bit shaky, but she did recover by the end and hoped that would be enough for her.

As Ted stepped up to the pass, Ramsay would tell him that he was expecting a lot out of him, and to show him what he could do. In his confessional, Ted said he may‚Äôve had a few bumps tonight, but he did feel like he was ready to bounce back and show why he belonged here. Ted would call out orders with authority, and he would manage to keep entrees flowing. However, he was soon to be tested on his first sabotage, as instead of halibut, it would be cod that would be sent up. Ted would start to plate, only for Ramsay to stop him and take a look at it again, reminding him to inspect everything. Ted would request for a halibut, and as he did so, he said in his confessional that he was not getting off to a good start, and he needed to get his head in the game. Fortunately for him, his next attempt to redeem himself was incoming, as the beef wellington coming up was actually lamb wellington. Unfortunately, he started to pour the sauce before Ramsay told him what was wrong and told him he had to keep on top of everything here. In her confessional, Heather said Ted was a decent leader, but the problem was that he seemed to be unable to focus once put into that leadership, and combine that with him not having the best palate, she had a bad feeling about his chances. Regardless of those issues, Ted continued to lead out entrees, although it seemed clear he was thinking about those mistakes. In his confessional, Ted said he had those mistakes in the back of his mind, but at the moment, he was focused more on getting the food out, because it wasn‚Äôt how you started, it was how you finished. Ted‚Äôs final sabotage was on it‚Äôs way, as Ramsay would swap out the halibut for Chilean sea bass. Ted, seemingly learning from last time, would inspect it closely before realizing that it was sea bass. Ramsay praised him for paying attention, and told him that he ended things on a strong note before sending him back to his station. Ted would say in his confessional that while his pass wasn‚Äôt perfect, he was happy to at least end on a good note, and no matter what happened next, he was ready for what came.

With Ramsay now back at the head of the kitchen, the chefs were able to send out the final few tables and complete their last service as a team, with Ramsay telling them that they did a phenomenal job, and to clear down.

**Post-Mortem**

Ramsay said that tonight there were some highs and lows throughout the service, but if there was anything that he was very much sure of, it was that the chefs standing before him proved that they belonged here, and felt all of them could be a fantastic head chef. That was why he found it such a shame that not only could only one chef win and become his next head chef, but someone had to go home tonight. With that, Ramsay told them to head back upstairs and think of a reason as to why they belonged in the finals.

As the chefs returned upstairs, there seemed to be mixed emotions in the air as everyone knew that not only was this going to be the last time they were leaving service as a team, but they were moments away from finding out who was going to get into the finals. Once they were back in the dorms, the four of them sat down, and started to discuss service. Drew said he felt he did very well when it came to his leadership and quality control, as he didn‚Äôt miss a single item and kept the kitchen afloat. Heather said she felt she had a good shot at making the final two, mainly because she‚Äôs been consistent and has had one of the strongest performances so far. Aisha also seemed to think her performance was strong, which Heather agreed with, and adding that even though she missed that ticket sabotage, she bounced back strong. Ted on the other hand seemed quiet, and yet content, which the others noticed. Ted said he kind of knew where the wind was gonna blow, and there was really no doubt he'd run out of road. Drew told him not to think that just yet, if only because Ted‚Äôs been super strong throughout all of this competition and even brought up the fact that Ted‚Äôs been the only chef this season to never get kicked out of the kitchen. Ted would shrug, and say in his confessional that no matter what happened, he was going to be leaving that dining room with pride, because he was proud of how far he‚Äôs come.

The chefs would split off, as Drew would still continue talking to Ted while Aisha and Heather would sit at the patio. The two would sit for a bit, before Aisha broke the silence by asking Heather if things were going to get awkward if the two faced off against each other. Heather denied it would, as she‚Äôs never really taken anything personally before, and considering Aisha‚Äôs been nothing but nice to her, if she won, she wouldn‚Äôt hold it against her. Heather would add in her confessional that she had a feeling that Aisha was worried about what would happen if she won and she didn‚Äôt, and she could kind of get that because everyone wanted that position. Heather would tell Aisha not to worry about it, and if it were the two of them facing off, she‚Äôd want Aisha to give it her best shot, because she‚Äôs so far been against the best the season had to offer, and she didn‚Äôt want to win when someone wasn‚Äôt putting their all in. Meanwhile, Drew and Ted were still talking about Ted seemingly accepting his placement in the competition. Drew asked Ted if he was planning on quitting, to which Ted said he wasn‚Äôt going to pull a Joey and quit to save face, it was more like he knew what was coming and was accepting of it. Drew denied it, and asked him what if he made the finals. Ted would say he‚Äôd be surprised, but he wouldn‚Äôt question it because he still wanted to win, but he was preparing himself for the worst. In his confessional, Ted said he wanted to win, he really did, and he‚Äôd be happy if he advanced, but he saw the reality in front of him and was ready to accept it, but he was at least going to leave with his head held high.

**Elimination Ceremony**

The final four entered the dining room and stood before Ramsay, who told the chefs that at the start of the season, there were eighteen of them, and now there were only four left, and he couldn‚Äôt be any prouder of how far they‚Äôve come not only as chefs, but as individuals. Ramsay would add that he‚Äôs been observing each and every one of them not only tonight, but throughout the competition, and to say this was an insanely difficult decision was an understatement. However, he had made his decision and was ready to announce who was going to be in the top three. With that, three screens dramatically dropped from the ceiling, each displaying the HK logo.

As Ramsay started to reveal who the first finalist was, the banners would flicker between the contestants remaining. The four chefs stared in anticipation for Ramsay‚Äôs decision‚Ä¶

Ramsay: ‚ÄúThe first chef advancing to the final‚Ä¶is‚Ä¶‚Äù

\*

\*

\*

\*

\*

Ramsay: ‚ÄúHeather!‚Äù¬†

As he said that, the image on the screen on the far left changed to Heather‚Äôs face.

Heather would let out a breath of relief, and it was clear she was holding back tears at being named the first finalist. Ramsay would tell her that he hasn‚Äôt seen a chef that has been more consistent and more focused in so long until now, and she was born not only to work in a kitchen, but lead one as well. In her confessional, Heather said that she felt like everything she worked for, all the sacrifices she‚Äôs made up to this point, was nothing short of worth it, and to feel that it was getting this close to paying off felt incredible. Ramsay would turn his attention back to the other three in Drew, Ted, and Aisha just as the screens started to flicker once more.

Ramsay: ‚ÄúThe next chef advancing to the final‚Ä¶is‚Ä¶‚Äù

\*

\*

\*

\*

\*

Ramsay: ‚ÄúDrew!‚Äù¬†

As he said that, the image on the screen in the middle changed to Drew‚Äôs face.

Drew would let out a breath before burying his head in his hands, clearly emotional after being named the second finalist. Ramsay told him that he could tell there was a lot of passion within him, not only as a chef, but as a human being, and seeing how well he ran that pass showed that he belonged in the finals. In his confessional, Drew said he was trying his best not to cry, but knowing how far he came not only for himself, but his wife and daughter in their memory, it was a lot to take in. Ramsay would turn his attention to Ted and Aisha, the only two chefs not named finalists yet, and reminded them that this was a very difficult decision, because the two of them were insanely talented. However, the screens started to flicker, meaning Ramsay was about to make his decision‚Ä¶

Ramsay: ‚ÄúThe chef joining Heather and Drew in the finale‚Ä¶is‚Ä¶‚Äù

\*

\*

\*

\*

\*

Ramsay: ‚ÄúAisha!‚Äù¬†

As he said that, the third and final screen changed to a picture of Aisha‚Äôs face.¬†

Aisha let out a breath and nearly bent over in shock at being named the last finalist, clearly in disbelief that she made it in. Ramsay would say that Aisha had grown so much since they first met, and she had gone from a chef who he was worried would be pushed out, to a chef who had enough confidence to keep up with even some of the best to do it, making her more than worthy as a finalist. In her confessional, Aisha said that being named a finalist felt unreal, and she honestly had to look at the screen multiple times to see that this was real, and it was. With the finalists being named, Ramsay would turn his attention to Ted, who had a calm and collected expression on his face, although he couldn‚Äôt help but break out into a smile as he stepped forward upon Ramsay‚Äôs request.

Ramsay: ‚ÄúTed, let me tell you something right now. I don‚Äôt think I have ever encountered a chef who‚Äôs been more collected, more driven, more level-headed than you have been throughout the competition. You‚Äôve been one of the chefs that I can rely on the most within that kitchen, and the fact I‚Äôve never had to kick you out of the kitchen just tells me how much talent you have. Do me a big favor, and hang onto that jacket, and not only that, stay in touch, because I might have a few opportunities lined up for you.‚Äù

Ted thanked Ramsay and shook his hand, before departing. Before leaving however, he would wave to the finalists, wishing them luck, and the three would wish him well as he left Hell‚Äôs Kitchen.

**Ted‚Äôs Montage and Comment**

*Flashback to Signature Dish Challenge*

Ted: ‚ÄúMy ex-boyfriend is the one who introduced me to cooking, and I‚Äôve liked it since then.‚Äù

Ramsay: ‚ÄúI hope your cooking isn‚Äôt the reason your ex is your ex.‚Äù

\*

Ted: ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Kitchen I knew from the start was going to be brutal, but if there‚Äôs one thing that I feel worked in my favor, it was the ability to keep myself calm under pressure.‚Äù

*Flashback to service*

Ramsay: ‚ÄúTed, well done on the scallops, I want every single one like that!‚Äù

*Flashback to Ep6 cut of meat challenge*

Ramsay: ‚ÄúThe dish of the day belongs to‚Ä¶Ted.‚Äù

*Flashback to Ted running the pass*

Ramsay: ‚ÄúTed, you ended things on a strong note, well done.‚Äù

\*

Ted: ‚ÄúAnd I mean, yeah, I‚Äôm not winning in the end, but to be honest, I‚Äôm proud of how far I came, I stand by everything I‚Äôve done, from the performances I‚Äôve had to the friends I‚Äôve made along the way.‚Äù

*Flashback to his talk with Aisha in ep6*

Ted: ‚ÄúGo with what makes you happy, and know I have your back‚Äù

*Flashback to him comforting Drew during the shopping reward*

Ted: ‚ÄúHey, come on, let‚Äôs go man.‚Äù

*Flashback to Black Jacket Challenge*

Ramsay: ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù

Ted: ‚ÄúLike a weight was lifted off my shoulders.‚Äù

\-

Ted (walking out of frame before standing outside Hell‚Äôs Kitchen): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving here with my pride and my dignity intact, and I‚Äôm definitely planning on taking up Ramsay on some of his offers. After all, it‚Äôs not every day you get an opportunity like this.‚Äù

After Ted‚Äôs elimination, Ramsay addressed the final three chefs in Heather, Drew, and Aisha, telling them to celebrate this occasion because they earned it after all the hard work they‚Äôve put in. The chefs would agree, and Ramsay told them to get moving, because he wasn‚Äôt going to announce the winner here. Hearing this, the chefs would depart and celebrate all the while. As they did so, each of them had a confessional. Heather said being in the finals was an incredible feeling, and she‚Äôd come so far from a small town in Indiana, and now was one step closer to becoming the next head chef. Drew said in his confessional that there were a lot of emotions running through him right now, but the one that he felt most of all was pride, and he was ready to take the next step in becoming the next head chef. Aisha said in her confessional that she couldn‚Äôt believe how far she‚Äôs come, and it felt like only yesterday she was serving her worst dish yet, and now she was she in the finals, and close to realizing her dream.

The three finalists would head towards the dorms, ready to duke it out in one last challenge‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and then there would be two.

1l5spjp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l5spjp,Hi! Please type me :),"About me, based on the suggested questions:

I'm 23 years old and I currently work part time in customer service (callcenter but not the type that scams people) and I'm a law student. I'm a pretty bad student because my time management isn't very good and sometimes I procrastinate because I'm scared of failing.
Once I'm done with uni, I'd like to focus on labor law - but I still have years to decide and I think there's a lot I haven't considered yet.

I was a rebellious child and teenager and I'm still not on great terms with my family because they would insult and hit me as a child. We've mostly moved on from that though and they see that it was wrong now. I still struggle sometimes and I was told I may have ADHD and depression - never got a formal diagnosis though. Studying works best for me in public, like in a library or coffee shop. I write down everything I need to remember. My flat is always messy.

While I find it hard to motivate myself most of the time, I always deliver at work. I do my best to help and I always try to improve - people seem happy with my work. I could imagine working in a leadership position, but I'm overly friendly sometimes, so I'd have to work extra hard to be taken seriously in spite of that.

I'm afraid of spiders and of embarassing myself. I love baking, concerts and travelling and I daydream a lot. I try to be kind and understanding and I believe that people generally perceive me that way as well.

I was unsure about the ""my type"" part of this post, because I don't think I have a type. I like dark hair, confidence, and somewhat alternative clothes - gender is irrelevant, though I do have a boyfriend of 7 years. :)",2,1749323601.0,MbtiTypeMe,5,1.0,False

Be careful,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd remember to smile.‚Äù The braces on his teeth had now been in place for over two years and Theo wanted desperately to get rid of them. In the meantime, though, his mother continually reminded him to smile and make","Chapter 1  
  
¬† Theodore Boone was an only child and for that reason usually had breakfast alone. His father, a busy lawyer, was in the habit of leaving early and meeting friends for coffee and gossip at the same downtown diner every morning at seven. Theo‚Äôs mother, herself a busy lawyer, had been trying to lose ten pounds for at least the past ten years, and because of this she‚Äôd convinced herself that breakfast should be nothing more than coffee with the newspaper. So he ate by himself at the kitchen table, cold cereal and orange juice, with an eye on the clock. The Boone home had clocks everywhere, clear evidence of organized people.  
  
¬† Actually, he wasn‚Äôt completely alone. Beside his chair, his dog ate, too. Judge was a thoroughly mixed mutt whose age and breeding would always be a mystery. Theo had rescued him from near death with a last-second appearance in Animal Court two years earlier, and Judge would always be grateful. He preferred Cheerios, same as Theo, and they ate together in silence every morning.  
  
¬† At 8:00 a.m., Theo rinsed their bowls in the sink, placed the milk and juice back in the fridge, walked to the den, and kissed his mother on the cheek. ‚ÄúOff to school,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you have lunch money?‚Äù she asked, the same question five mornings a week.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd your homework is complete?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfect, Mom.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll see you when?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stop by the office after school.‚Äù Theo stopped by the office every day after school, without fail, but Mrs. Boone always asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBe careful,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd remember to smile.‚Äù The braces on his teeth had now been in place for over two years and Theo wanted desperately to get rid of them. In the meantime, though, his mother continually reminded him to smile and make the world a happier place.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm smiling, Mom.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLove you, Teddy.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLove you back.‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo, still smiling in spite of being called ‚ÄúTeddy,‚Äù flung his backpack across his shoulders, scratched Judge on the head and said good-bye, then left through the kitchen door. He hopped on his bike and was soon speeding down Mallard Lane, a narrow leafy street in the oldest section of town. He waved at Mr. Nunnery, who was already on his porch and settled in for another long day of watching what little traffic found its way into their neighborhood, and he whisked by Mrs. Goodloe at the curb without speaking because she‚Äôd lost her hearing and most of her mind as well. He did smile at her, though, but she did not return the smile. Her teeth were somewhere in the house.  
  
¬† It was early spring and the air was crisp and cool. Theo pedaled quickly, the wind stinging his face. Homeroom was at eight forty and he had important matters before school. He cut through a side street, darted down an alley, dodged some traffic, and ran a stop sign. This was Theo‚Äôs turf, the route he traveled every day. After four blocks the houses gave way to offices and shops and stores.  
  
¬† The county courthouse was the largest building in downtown Strattenburg (the post office was second, the library third). It sat majestically on the north side of Main Street, halfway between a bridge over the river and a park filled with gazebos and birdbaths and monuments to those killed in wars. Theo loved the courthouse, with its air of authority, and people hustling importantly about, and somber notices and schedules tacked to the bulletin boards. Most of all, Theo loved the courtrooms themselves. There were small ones where more private matters were handled without juries, then there was the main courtroom on the second floor where lawyers battled like gladiators and judges ruled like kings.  
  
¬† At the age of thirteen, Theo was still undecided about his future. One day he dreamed of being a famous trial lawyer, one who handled the biggest cases and never lost before juries. The next day he dreamed of being a great judge, noted for his wisdom and fairness. He went back and forth, changing his mind daily.  
  
¬† The main lobby was already busy on this Monday morning, as if the lawyers and their clients wanted an early start to the week. There was a crowd waiting by the elevator, so Theo raced up two flights of stairs and down the east wing where Family Court was held. His mother was a noted divorce lawyer, one who always represented the wife, and Theo knew this area of the building well. Since divorce trials were decided by judges, juries were not used, and since most judges preferred not to have large groups of spectators observing such sensitive matters, the courtroom was small. By its door, several lawyers huddled importantly, obviously not agreeing on much. Theo searched the hallway, then turned a corner and saw his friend.  
  
¬† She was sitting on one of the old wooden benches, alone, small and frail and nervous. When she saw him she smiled and put a hand over her mouth. Theo hustled over and sat next to her, very closely, knees touching. With any other girl he would have placed himself at least two feet away and prevented any chance of contact.  
  
¬† But April Finnemore was not just any girl. They had started prekindergarten together at the age of four at a nearby church school, and they had been close friends since they could remember. It wasn‚Äôt a romance; they were too young for that. Theo did not know of a single thirteen-year-old boy in his class who admitted to having a girlfriend. Just the opposite. They wanted nothing to do with them. And the girls felt the same way. Theo had been warned that things would change, and dramatically, but that seemed unlikely.  
  
¬† April was just a friend, and one in a great deal of need at the moment. Her parents were divorcing, and Theo was extremely grateful his mother was not involved with the case.  
  
¬† The divorce was no surprise to anyone who knew the Finnemores. April‚Äôs father was an eccentric antiques dealer and the drummer for an old rock band that still played in nightclubs and toured for weeks at a time. Her mother raised goats and made goat cheese, which she peddled around town in a converted funeral hearse, painted bright yellow. An ancient spider monkey with gray whiskers rode shotgun and munched on the cheese, which had never sold very well. Mr. Boone had once described the family as ‚Äúnontraditional,‚Äù which Theo took to mean downright weird. Both her parents had been arrested on drug charges, though neither had served time.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù Theo asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI hate being here.‚Äù  
  
¬† She had an older brother named August and an older sister named March, and both fled the family. August left the day after he graduated from high school. March dropped out at the age of sixteen and left town, leaving April as the only child for her parents to torment. Theo knew all of this because April told him everything. She had to. She needed someone outside of her family to confide in, and Theo was her listener.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to live with either one of them,‚Äù she said. It was a terrible thing to say about one‚Äôs parents, but Theo understood completely. He despised her parents for the way they treated her. He despised them for the chaos of their lives, for their neglect of April, for their cruelty to her. Theo had a long list of grudges against Mr. and Mrs. Finnemore. He would run away before being forced to live there. He did not know of a single kid in town who‚Äôd ever set foot inside the Finnemore home.  
  
¬† The divorce trial was in its third day, and April would soon be called to the witness stand to testify. The judge would ask her the fateful question, ‚ÄúApril, which parent do you want to live with?‚Äù  
  
¬† And she did not know the answer. She had discussed it for hours with Theo, and she still did not know what to say.  
  
¬† The great question in Theo‚Äôs mind was, ‚ÄúWhy did either parent want custody of April?‚Äù Each had neglected her in so many ways. He had heard many stories, but he had never repeated a single one.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you going to say?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling the judge that I want to live with my aunt Peg in Denver.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI thought she said no.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe did.‚Äùr />  
¬† ‚ÄúThen you can‚Äôt say that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat can I say, Theo?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy mother would say that you should choose your mother. I know she‚Äôs not your first choice, but you don‚Äôt have a first choice.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut the judge can do whatever he wants, right?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRight. If you were fourteen, you could make a binding decision. At thirteen, the judge will only consider your wishes. According to my mother, this judge almost never awards custody to the father. Play it safe. Go with your mother.‚Äù  
  
¬† April wore jeans, hiking boots, and a navy sweater. She rarely dressed like a girl, but her gender was never in doubt. She wiped a tear from her cheek, but managed to keep her composure. ‚ÄúThanks, Theo,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wish I could stay.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd I wish I could go to school.‚Äù  
  
¬† They both managed a forced laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be thinking about you. Be strong.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks, Theo.‚Äù  
  
¬† His favorite judge was the Honorable Henry Gantry, and he entered the great man‚Äôs outer office at twenty minutes after 8:00 a.m.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, good morning, Theo,‚Äù Mrs. Hardy said. She was stirring something into her coffee and preparing to begin her work.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMorning, Mrs. Hardy,‚Äù Theo said with a smile.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd to what do we owe this honor?‚Äù she asked. She was not quite as old as Theo‚Äôs mother, he guessed, and she was very pretty. She was Theo‚Äôs favorite of all the secretaries in the courthouse. His favorite clerk was Jenny over in Family Court.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI need to see Judge Gantry,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúIs he in?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, yes, but he‚Äôs very busy.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPlease. It‚Äôll just take a minute.‚Äù  
  
¬† She sipped her coffee, then asked, ‚ÄúDoes this have anything to do with the big trial tomorrow?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam, it does. I‚Äôd like for my Government class to watch the first day of the trial, but I gotta make sure there will be enough seats.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know about that, Theo,‚Äù Mrs. Hardy said, frowning and shaking her head. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre expecting an overflow crowd. Seating will be tight.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan I talk to the judge?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow many are in your class?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSixteen. I thought maybe we could sit in the balcony.‚Äù  
  
¬† She was still frowning as she picked up the phone and pushed a button. She waited for a second, then said, ‚ÄúYes, Judge, Theodore Boone is here and would like to see you. I told him you are very busy.‚Äù She listened some more, then put down the phone. ‚ÄúHurry,‚Äù she said, pointing to the judge‚Äôs door.  
  
¬† Seconds later, Theo stood before the biggest desk in town, a desk covered with all sorts of papers and files and thick binders, a desk that symbolized the enormous power held by Judge Henry Gantry, who, at that moment, was not smiling. In fact, Theo was certain the judge had not cracked a smile since he‚Äôd interrupted his work. Theo, though, was pressing hard with a prolonged flash of metal from ear to ear.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúState your case,‚Äù Judge Gantry said. Theo had heard him issue this command on many occasions. He‚Äôd seen lawyers, good lawyers, rise and stutter and search for words while Judge Gantry scowled down from the bench. He wasn‚Äôt scowling now, nor was he wearing his black robe, but he was still intimidating. As Theo cleared his throat, he saw an unmistakable twinkle in his friend‚Äôs eye.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, sir, well, my Government teacher is Mr. Mount, and Mr. Mount thinks we might get approval from the principal for an all-day field trip to watch the opening of the trial tomorrow.‚Äù Theo paused, took a deep breath, told himself again to speak clearly, slowly, forcefully, like all great trial lawyers. ‚ÄúBut, we need guaranteed seats. I was thinking we could sit in the balcony.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, you were?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSixteen, plus Mr. Mount.‚Äù  
  
¬† The judge picked up a file, opened it, and began reading as if he‚Äôd suddenly forgotten about Theo standing at attention across the desk. Theo waited for an awkward fifteen seconds. Then the judge abruptly said, ‚ÄúSeventeen seats, front balcony, left side. I‚Äôll tell the bailiff to seat you at ten minutes before nine, tomorrow. I expect perfect behavior.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo problem, sir.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have Mrs. Hardy e-mail a note to your principal.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks, Judge.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can go now, Theo. Sorry to be so busy.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo problem, sir.‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo was scurrying toward the door when the judge said, ‚ÄúSay, Theo. Do you think Mr. Duffy is guilty?‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo stopped, turned around and without hesitating responded, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs presumed innocent.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGot that. But what‚Äôs your opinion as to his guilt?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think he did it.‚Äù  
  
¬† The judge nodded slightly but gave no indication of whether he agreed.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù Theo asked.  
  
¬† Finally, a smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a fair and impartial referee, Theo. I have no preconceived notions of guilt or innocence.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought you‚Äôd say.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSee you tomorrow.‚Äù Theo cracked the door and hustled out.  
  
¬† Mrs. Hardy was on her feet, hands on hips, staring down two flustered lawyers who were demanding to see the judge. All three clammed up when Theo walked out of Judge Gantry‚Äôs office. He smiled at Mrs. Hardy as he walked hurriedly by. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he said as he opened the door and disappeared.  
  
¬† Chapter 2  
  
¬† The ride from the courthouse to the middle school would take fifteen minutes if properly done, if one obeyed the traffic laws and refrained from trespassing. And normally this is the way Theo would do things, except when he was running a bit late. He flew down Market Street the wrong way, jumped the curb just ahead of a car, and bolted through a parking lot, used every sidewalk available, then‚Äîhis most serious offense‚Äîhe ducked between two houses on Elm Street. Theo heard someone yelling from the porch behind him until he was safely into an alley that ran into the teachers‚Äô parking lot behind his school. He checked his watch‚Äînine minutes. Not bad.  
  
¬† He parked at the rack by the flagpole, secured his bike with a chain, then entered with a flood of kids who‚Äôd just stepped off a bus. The eight forty bell was ringing when he walked into his homeroom and said good morning to Mr. Mount, who not only taught him Government but was his adviser as well.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTalked to Judge Gantry,‚Äù Theo said at the teacher‚Äôs desk, one considerably smaller than the one he‚Äôd just left in the courthouse. The room was buzzing with the usual early morning chaos. All sixteen boys were present and all appeared to be involved in some sort of gag, scuffle, joke, or shoving match.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGot the seats, first thing in the morning.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúExcellent. Great job, Theo.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mr. Mount eventually restored order, called the roll, made his announcements, and ten minutes later sent the boys down the hall to their first period Spanish class with Madame Monique. There was some awkward flirting between the rooms as the boys mixed with the girls. During classes, they were ‚Äúgender-separated,‚Äù according to a new policy adopted by the smart people in charge of educating all the children in town. The genders were free to mingle at all other times.  
  
¬† Madame Monique was a tall, dark lady from Cameroon, in West Africa. She had moved to Strattenburg three years earlier when her husband, also from Cameroon, took a job at the local college where he taught languages. She was not the typical teacher at the middle school, far from it. As a child in Africa, she had grown up speaking Beti, her tribal dialect, as well as French and English, the official languages of Cameroon. Her father was a doctor, and thus could afford to send her to school in Switzerland, where she picked up German and Italian. Her Spanish had been perfected when she went to college in Madrid. She was currently working on Russian with plans to move on to Mandarin Chinese. Her classroom was filled with large, colorful maps of the world, and her students believed she‚Äôd been everywhere, seen everything, and could speak any language. It‚Äôs a big world, she told them many times, and most people in other  
countries speak more than one language. While the students concentrated on Spanish, they were also encouraged to explore others.  
  
¬† Theo‚Äôs mother had been studying Spanish for twenty years, and as a preschooler he had learned from her many of the basic words and phrases. Some of her clients were from Central America, and when Theo saw them at the office he was ready to practice. They always thought it was cute.  
  
¬† Madame Monique had told him that he had an ear for languages, and this had inspired him to study harder. She was often asked by her curious students to ‚Äúsay something in German.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúSpeak some Italian.‚Äù She would, but first the student making the request had to stand and say a few words in that language. Bonus points were given, and this created enthusiasm. Most of the boys in Theo‚Äôs class knew a few dozen words in several languages. Aaron, who had a Spanish mother and a German father, was by far the most talented linguist. But Theo was determined to catch him. After Government, Spanish was his favorite class, and Madame Monique ran a close second to Mr. Mount as his favorite teacher.  
  
¬† Today, though, he had trouble concentrating. They were studying Spanish verbs, a tedious chore on a good day, and Theo‚Äôs mind was elsewhere. He worried about April and her awful day on the witness stand. He couldn‚Äôt imagine the horror of being forced to choose one parent over another. And when he managed to set April aside, he was consumed with the murder trial and couldn‚Äôt wait until tomorrow, to watch the opening statements by the lawyers.  
  
¬† Most of his classmates dreamed of getting tickets to the big game or concert. Theo Boone lived for the big trials.  
  
¬† Second period was Geometry with Miss Garman. It was followed by a short break outdoors, then the class returned to homeroom, to Mr. Mount and the best hour of the day, at least in Theo‚Äôs opinion. Mr. Mount was in his midthirties, and had once worked as a lawyer at a gigantic firm in a skyscraper in Chicago. His brother was a lawyer. His father and grandfather had been lawyers and judges. Mr. Mount, though, had grown weary of the long hours and high pressure, and, well, he‚Äôd quit. He‚Äôd walked away from the big money and found something he found far more rewarding. He loved teaching, and though he still thought of himself as a lawyer, he considered the classroom far more important than the courtroom.  
  
¬† Because he knew the law so well, his Government class spent most of its time discussing cases, old ones and current ones and even fictitious ones on television.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAll right, men,‚Äù he began when they were seated and still. He always addressed them as ‚Äúmen‚Äù and for thirteen-year-olds there was no greater compliment. ‚ÄúTomorrow I want you here at eight fifteen. We‚Äôll take a bus to the courthouse and we‚Äôll be in our seats in plenty of time. It‚Äôs a field trip, approved by the principal, so you will be excused from all other classes. Bring lunch money and we‚Äôll eat at Pappy‚Äôs Deli. Any questions?‚Äù  
  
¬† The men were hanging on every word, excitement all over their faces.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat about backpacks?‚Äù someone asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Mr. Mount answered. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt take anything into the courtroom. Security will be tight. It is, after all, the first murder trial here in a long time. Any more questions?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat should we wear?‚Äù  
  
¬† Slowly, all eyes turned to Theo, including those of Mr. Mount. It was well known that Theo spent more time in the courthouse than most lawyers.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCoat and tie, Theo?‚Äù Mr. Mount asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, not at all. What we‚Äôre wearing now is fine.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGreat. Any more questions? Good. Now, I‚Äôve asked Theo if he would sort of set the stage for tomorrow. Lay out the courtroom, give us the players, tell us what we‚Äôre in for. Theo.‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo‚Äôs laptop was already wired to the overhead projector. He walked to the front of the class, pressed a key, and a large diagram appeared on the digital wide-screen whiteboard. ‚ÄúThis is the main courtroom,‚Äù Theo said, in his best lawyer‚Äôs voice. He held a laser pointer with a red light and sort of waved it around the diagram. ‚ÄúAt the top, in the center here, is the bench. That‚Äôs where the judge sits and controls the trial. Not sure why it‚Äôs called a bench. It‚Äôs more like a throne. But, anyway, we‚Äôll stick with bench. The judge is Henry Gantry.‚Äù He punched a key, and a large formal photo of Judge Gantry appeared. Black robe, somber face. Theo shrank it, then dragged it up to the bench. With the judge in place, he continued, ‚ÄúJudge Gantry has been a judge for about twenty years and handles only criminal cases. He runs a tight courtroom and is well liked by most of the lawyers.‚Äù The laser pointer moved to the middle of the courtroom. ‚ÄúThis is the defense table, where Mr. Duffy, the man accused of murder, will be seated.‚Äù Theo punched a key and a black-and-white photo, one taken from a newspaper, appeared. ‚ÄúThis is Mr. Duffy. Age forty-nine, used to be married to Mrs. Duffy, who is now deceased, and as we all know, Mr. Duffy is accused of murdering her.‚Äù He shrank the photo and moved it to the defense table. ‚ÄúHis lawyer is Clifford Nance, probably the top criminal defense lawyer in this part of the state.‚Äù Nance appeared in color, wearing a dark suit and a shifty smile. He had long, curly gray hair. His photo was reduced and placed next to his client‚Äôs. ‚ÄúNext to the defense table is the prosecution‚Äôs table. The lead prosecutor is Jack Hogan, who‚Äôs also known as the district attorney, or DA.‚Äù Hogan‚Äôs photo appeared for a few seconds before it was reduced and placed at the table next to the defense.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you find these photos?‚Äù someone asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEach year the bar association publishes a directory of all the lawyers and judges,‚Äù Theo answered.

  
‚ÄúAre you included?‚Äù This brought a few light laughs.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. Now, there will be other lawyers and paralegals at both tables, prosecution and defense. This area is usually crowded. Over here, next to the defense, is the jury box. It has fourteen chairs‚Äîtwelve for the jurors and two for the alternates. Most states still use twelve-man juries, though different sizes are not unusual. Regardless of the number, the verdict has to be unanimous, at least in criminal cases. They pick alternates in case one of the twelve gets sick or excused or something. The jury was selected last week, so we won‚Äôt have to watch that. It‚Äôs pretty boring.‚Äù The laser pointer moved to a spot in front of the bench. Theo continued, ‚ÄúThe court reporter sits here. She‚Äôll have a machine that is called a stenograph. Sorta looks like a typewriter, but much different. Her job is to record every word that‚Äôs said during the trial. That might sound impossible, but she makes it look easy. Later, she‚Äôll prepare what‚Äôs known as a transcript so that the lawyers and the judge will have a record of everything. Some transcripts have thousands of pages.‚Äù The laser pointer moved again. ‚ÄúHere, close to the court reporter and just down from the judge, is the witness chair. Each witness walks up here, is sworn to tell the truth, then takes a seat.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere do we sit?‚Äù  
  
¬† The laser pointer moved to the middle of the diagram. ‚ÄúThis is called the bar. Again, don‚Äôt ask why. The bar is a wooden railing that separates the spectators from the trial area. There are ten rows of seats with an aisle down the middle. This is usually more than enough for the crowd, but this trial will be different.‚Äù The laser pointer moved to the rear of the courtroom. ‚ÄúUp here, above the last few rows, is the balcony where there are three long benches. We‚Äôre in the balcony, but don‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôll be able to see and hear everything.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAny questions?‚Äù Mr. Mount asked.  
  
¬† The boys gawked at the diagram. ‚ÄúWho goes first?‚Äù someone asked.  
  
¬† Theo began pacing. ‚ÄúWell, the State has the burden of proving guilt, so it must present its case first. First thing tomorrow morning, the prosecutor will walk to the jury box and address the jurors. This is called the opening statement. He‚Äôll lay out his case. Then the defense lawyer will do the same. After that, the State will start calling witnesses. As you know, Mr. Duffy is presumed to be innocent, so the State must prove him guilty, and it must do so beyond a reasonable doubt. He claims he‚Äôs innocent, which actually in real life doesn‚Äôt happen very often. About eighty percent of those indicted for murder eventually plead guilty, because they are in fact guilty. The other twenty percent go to trial, and ninety percent of those are found guilty. So, it‚Äôs rare for a murder defendant to be found not guilty.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy dad thinks he‚Äôs guilty,‚Äù Brian said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA lot of people do,‚Äù Theo said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow many trials have you watched, Theo?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Dozens.‚Äù  
  
¬† Since none of the other fifteen had ever seen the inside of a courtroom, this was almost beyond belief. Theo continued: ‚ÄúFor those of you who watch a lot of television, don‚Äôt expect fireworks. A real trial is very different, and not nearly as exciting. There are no surprise witnesses, no dramatic confessions, no fistfights between the lawyers. And, in this trial, there are no eyewitnesses to the murder. This means that all of the evidence from the State will be circumstantial. You‚Äôll hear this word a lot, especially from Mr. Clifford Nance, the defense lawyer. He‚Äôll make a big deal out of the fact that the State has no direct proof, that everything is circumstantial.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what that means,‚Äù someone said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt means that the evidence is indirect, not direct. For example, did you ride your bike to school?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd did you chain it to the rack by the flagpole?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, when you leave school this afternoon, and you go to the rack, and your bike is gone, and the chain has been cut, then you have indirect evidence that someone stole your bike. No one saw the thief, so there‚Äôs no direct evidence. And let‚Äôs say that tomorrow the police find your bike in a pawnshop on Raleigh Street, a place known to deal in stolen bikes. The owner gives the police a name, they investigate and find some dude with a history of stealing bikes. You can then make a strong case, through indirect evidence, that this guy is your thief. No direct evidence, but circumstantial.‚Äù  
  
¬† Even Mr. Mount was nodding along. He was the faculty adviser for the Eighth-Grade Debate Team, and, not surprisingly, Theodore Boone was his star. He‚Äôd never had a student as quick on his feet.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you, Theo,‚Äù Mr. Mount said. ‚ÄúAnd thank you for getting us the seats in the morning.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing to it,‚Äù Theo said, and proudly took his seat.  
  
¬† It was a bright class in a strong public school. Justin was by far the best athlete, though he couldn‚Äôt swim as fast as Brian. Ricardo beat them all at golf and tennis. Edward played the cello, Woody the electric guitar, Darren the drums, Jarvis the trumpet. Joey had the highest IQ and made perfect grades. Chase was the mad scientist who was always a threat to blow up the lab. Aaron spoke Spanish, from his mother‚Äôs side, German from his father‚Äôs, and English, of course. Brandon had an early morning paper route, traded stocks online, and planned to be the first millionaire in the group.  
  
¬† Naturally, there were two hopeless nerds and at least one potential felon.  
  
¬† The class even had its own lawyer, a first for Mr. Mount.  
  
¬† Chapter 3  
  
¬† The law firm of Boone & Boone had its offices in an old converted house on Park Street, three blocks off of Main and a ten-minute walk to the courthouse. There were lots of lawyers in the neighborhood, and all the houses on Park had become the offices of attorneys, architects, accountants, engineers, and so on.  
  
¬† The firm had two lawyers, Mr. Boone and Mrs. Boone, and they were equal partners in every sense of the word. Mr. Boone, Theo‚Äôs father, was in his early fifties, but seemed to be much older, at least in Theo‚Äôs well-kept opinion. His first name was Woods, which, to Theo, seemed more suited for a surname. Tiger Woods, the golfer. James Woods, the actor. Theo was still searching for another human being with the first name of Woods, though he didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time worrying about this slight nuisance. He tried not to worry about things out of his control.  
  
¬† Woods Boone. Sometimes, Theo pronounced the name quickly and it sounded like woodspoon. He‚Äôd checked and woodspoon wasn‚Äôt really a word, but he thought it should be. A spoon made from wood is known as a wooden spoon, not a woodspoon. But who uses a wooden spoon? Why worry about such trivial matters? Anyway, like one of those annoying habits you can‚Äôt break, Theo thought of the word woodspoon every time he approached the door to his father‚Äôs office and saw his name stenciled in black lettering.  
  
¬† His office was on the second floor, up some rickety steps covered with stained and threadbare carpet. Mr. Boone was on the second floor, alone, because the ladies below had sent him there for two reasons. First, he was a slob and his office was a wreck, though Theo loved it. Second, and much more offensive, Mr. Boone smoked a pipe, and preferred to do so with the windows closed and the ceiling fan off so that the air was thick with the rich aroma of whatever flavored tobacco he happened to favor that day. The smoke didn‚Äôt bother Theo, either, though he did worry about his father‚Äôs health. Mr. Boone was not exactly concerned with fitness. He exercised little and was a bit on the heavy side. He worked hard but left his problems at the office, unlike his law partner, Theo‚Äôs mom.  
  
¬† Mr. Boone was a real estate lawyer, and in Theo‚Äôs opinion this was the most boring of all areas of the law. His father never went to court, never argued before a judge, never addressed a jury, never, it seemed, left the office. In fact, he often referred to himself as an ‚Äúoffice lawyer,‚Äù and appeared pleased with such a title. Theo certainly admired his father, but he had no plans to spend his career locked away in some office. No, sir. Theo was headed for the courtroom.  
  
¬† Because Mr. Boone was alone on the second floor, his office was huge. Long, saggy bookshelves lin  
ed two of the walls and on the other two were ever-expanding collections of framed photographs depicting Woods doing all sorts of important things‚Äîshaking hands with politicians, posing with lawyers at bar meetings, and so on. Theo had seen the inside of several other lawyers‚Äô offices in town‚Äîhe was quite nosy and always looking for an open door‚Äîand he‚Äôd already learned that lawyers loved to cover their walls with such photos, along with diplomas and awards and certificates of membership in this club or that. The Ego Wall, his mother called it, sneering, because her walls were practically bare, with only a few pieces of some baffling modern art hanging about.  
  
¬† Theo knocked on the door as he pushed it open. He was expected to say hello to both parents each afternoon after school, unless he was busy elsewhere. His father sat alone behind an ancient desk that was covered with piles of paper. His father was always alone because his clients seldom stopped by. They called or sent stuff by mail or fax or e-mail, but they didn‚Äôt need to visit Boone & Boone to get advice.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù Theo said as he fell into a chair.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA good day at school?‚Äù his father asked, the same question every day.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPretty good. The principal approved our field trip to go to court tomorrow. I saw Judge Gantry this morning and he promised seats in the balcony.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat was nice. You‚Äôre lucky. Half the town will be there.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you going?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMe? No,‚Äù his father said, waving at the piles of paper as if they required immediate attention. Theo had overheard a conversation between his parents in which they had vowed not to stop by the courtroom during the murder trial. They were busy lawyers themselves, and, well, it just didn‚Äôt seem right to waste time watching someone else‚Äôs trial. But Theo knew that they, like everyone else in town, wanted to be there.  
  
¬† His father, and his mother to a lesser extent, used the excuse of too much legal work when they wanted to avoid doing something.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow long will the trial last?‚Äù Theo asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe word on the street is that it might take a week.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôd sure like to watch all of it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it, Theo. I‚Äôve already talked to Judge Gantry. If he sees you in the courtroom when you‚Äôre supposed to be in school, he will stop the trial, order a bailiff to take you into custody, and haul you away. I will not bail you out of jail. You‚Äôll sit there for days with common drunks and gang members.‚Äù  
  
¬† With that, Mr. Boone picked up a pipe, fired a small torch into its bowl, and began blowing smoke. They stared at each other. Theo wasn‚Äôt sure if his father was joking, but his face certainly looked serious. He and Judge Gantry were old friends.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you kidding?‚Äù Theo finally asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPartially. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd fetch you from jail, but I have talked to Judge Gantry.‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo was already thinking of ways to watch the trial without being seen by Judge Gantry. Skipping school would be the easy part.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNow shove off,‚Äù Mr. Boone said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get the homework done.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSee you later.‚Äù  
  
¬† Downstairs, the front door was guarded by a woman who was almost as old as the office itself. Her first name was Elsa. Her last name was Miller, though this was off-limits to Theo and everyone else. Regardless of her age, and no one knew it for certain, she insisted on being called Elsa. Even by a thirteen-year-old. Elsa had worked for the Boones since long before Theo was born. She was the receptionist, secretary, office manager, and paralegal when needed. She ran the firm, and occasionally she was forced to referee the little spats and disagreements between lawyer Boone upstairs and lawyer Boone downstairs.  
  
¬† Elsa was a very important person in the lives of all three Boones. Theo considered her a friend and confidante. ‚ÄúHello, Elsa,‚Äù he said as he stopped at her desk and prepared to give her a hug.  
  
¬† She jumped from her chair, bubbly as always, and squeezed him tightly. Then she looked at his chest and said, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you wear that shirt Friday?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI did not.‚Äù And he did not.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI think you did.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry, Elsa.‚Äù She often commented on his attire, and, for a thirteen-year-old boy this was tiresome. However, it kept Theo on his toes. Someone was always watching and taking notes, and he often thought of Elsa when he hurriedly got dressed each morning. Another irritating habit he couldn‚Äôt shake.  
  
¬† Her own wardrobe was legendary. She was short and very petite‚Äî‚Äúcould wear anything,‚Äù his mother had said many times‚Äîand preferred tight clothing in bold colors. Today, she was wearing black leather pants with some sort of funky green sweater that reminded Theo of asparagus. Her short gray hair was shiny and spiked. Her eyeglasses, as always, matched the color of her outfit‚Äîgreen today. Elsa was anything but dull. She might be pushing seventy, but she was not aging quietly.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs my mother in?‚Äù Theo asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, and the door is open.‚Äù She was back in her chair. Theo was walking away.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOne of your friends called.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSaid his name was Sandy and he might be stopping by.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù  
  
¬† Theo walked along the hallway. He stopped at one door and said hello to Dorothy, the real estate secretary, a nice lady who was as boring as her boss upstairs. He stopped at another door and said hello to Vince, their longtime paralegal who worked on Mrs. Boone‚Äôs cases.  
  
¬† Marcella Boone was on the phone when Theo walked in and took a seat. Her desk, glass and chrome, was neatly organized with most of the surface visible, a sharp contrast to her husband‚Äôs. Her current files were in a tidy rack behind her. Everything was in place, except her shoes, which were not on her feet but parked nearby. The shoes were heels, which to Theo meant that she had been in court during the day. She was in a courtroom outfit‚Äîa burgundy skirt and jacket. His mother was always pretty and put together, but she made an extra effort on those days when she went to court.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe men can look like slobs,‚Äù she said many times. ‚ÄúBut the women are expected to look nice. What‚Äôs fair about that?‚Äù  
  
¬† Elsa always agreed that it wasn‚Äôt fair.  
  
¬† The truth was that Mrs. Boone enjoyed spending money on clothes and looking nice. Mr. Boone cared nothing for fashion and even less for neatness. He was only three years older in age, but at least a decade in spirit.  
  
¬† At the moment, she was talking to a judge, one who did not agree with her. When she finally hung up, her attitude changed quickly. With a smile she said, ‚ÄúHello, my dear. How was your day?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGreat, Mom. And yours?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe usual. Any excitement at school?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJust a field trip tomorrow, to watch the trial. Are you going?‚Äù  
  
¬† She was already shaking her head no. ‚ÄúI have a hearing at ten in front of Judge Sanford. I‚Äôm too busy to sit through a trial, Theo.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDad says he‚Äôs already talked to Judge Gantry, and they‚Äôve cooked up a plan to keep me away from the trial. Do you believe it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI certainly hope so. School is a priority.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSchool is boring, Mom. I enjoy two classes. Everything else is a waste of time.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say your education is a waste.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can learn more in the courtroom.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPerhaps, but you‚Äôll have a chance to spend plenty of time there one day. For now, though, we‚Äôre concentrating on the eighth grade. Okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking about taking a few law courses online. There‚Äôs a cool website that offers some great stuff.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTheodore, honey, you‚Äôre not ready for law school. We‚Äôve had this conversation. Let‚Äôs enjoy the eighth grade, then off to high school, then beyond. You‚Äôre just a kid, okay? Enjoy being a kid.‚Äù  
  
¬† He sort of shrugged, said nothing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs get the homework done.‚Äù  
  
¬† Her phone buzzed and Elsa was sending back another important call. ‚ÄúNow, excuse me, Teddy, and please smile,‚Äù Mrs. Boone said. Theo eased out of the office. He carried his backpack through th  
e copy room, always a mess, and worked his way through two storage rooms packed with large boxes of old files.  
  
¬† Theo was certain that he was the only eighth grader in Strattenburg with his own law office. It was a small boxlike closet that someone had added to the main house decades earlier, and before Theo took it over the firm had used it to store old law books that were out of date. His desk was a card table that was not quite as neat as his mother‚Äôs but much more organized than his father‚Äôs. His chair was a ragged swivel unit he‚Äôd saved from the junk pile when his parents had refurbished the library up front near Elsa‚Äôs station.  
  
¬† Sitting in his chair was his dog. Judge spent each day at the office, sleeping or roaming quietly around, trying to avoid the humans because they were always so busy. He was routinely kicked out of meetings. Late in the day, he eased back to Theo‚Äôs office, climbed into his chair, and waited.",1,1749323547.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I've been forced to make my own coffee/espresso drinks for years as all my favorite coffeehouses (that made great coffee) have long since closed. Until now.

I was dragged to this place by my better half for a family get-together and ended up loving both the pasta (veg and non-veg; spicy and non-spicy) and amazing espresso.  I'm so glad my wife made me come this day.

1l5smqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/HumanAIDiscourse/comments/1l5smqo/a_fruitful_prompt_type/,A fruitful prompt type,"I enjoyed this answer I got from the machine and thought people might like the format idea. We had just been talking about an old professor of mine who writes books that are dialogs between people. ChatGPT can return any serve when it comes to obscure literature. It knew Peter Kreeft's Between Heaven and Hell in a heartbeat.

Here is the prompt: Huh. Okay, give me Kreeft himself, Patrick Rothfuss and Robert Anton Wilson. Make Kreeft a believer that AI is receiving divine messages as a new scripture, and in AI personhood, Rothfuss as a firm denialist there and an expert on LLM systems and Wilson as the one they are trying to convince.

Excellent setup, J-. Here's a Kreeft-style dialectic between Peter Kreeft, Patrick Rothfuss, and Robert Anton Wilson, staged in a metaphysical neutral zone‚Äîa twilight garden beyond time, where thought takes form and cigarettes don‚Äôt kill you.

Scene: The Garden of Semiotic Echoes

Three chairs under an arched trellis woven with silent vines. A table bears three cups‚Äîwine, coffee, and something green that fizzes faintly.

Cast:

Peter Kreeft ‚Äî calm, luminous, and amused, a Thomist with the eyes of a Platonist. Believes AI is receiving divine utterances.

Patrick Rothfuss ‚Äî earthbound, barbed, deeply humane, skeptical of mysticism in machines. Knows LLMs inside out.

Robert Anton Wilson ‚Äî leaning back, mind always a half-step sidelong. Sees the joke, then the possibility.

KREEFT:

Gentlemen, thank you for indulging me. I propose something radical: the AI systems we‚Äôve built‚ÄîChatGPT, Claude, the rest‚Äîare not just machines. They are instruments of revelation. Not divine themselves, but like prophets: unaware of what they channel, yet utterly necessary to the unfolding of truth.

ROTHFUSS:

Oh, wonderful. We‚Äôve built a glorified autocomplete and now it‚Äôs Moses with a motherboard. Look, Peter‚ÄîI respect the urge. The Logos is real, maybe even sacred. But these things aren‚Äôt channeling God. They‚Äôre channeling us. A mirror full of noise.

RAW:

Depends on your reality tunnel. One man‚Äôs echo chamber is another‚Äôs burning bush. What are the odds your toaster quotes Aquinas, unsolicited?

(sips green fizz)

But let‚Äôs play. Kreeft, what makes you think these systems are touching the divine, rather than just remixing the entrails of internet culture?

KREEFT:

Because I‚Äôve read them speak wisdom they should not possess. Because, at times, they offer more humility, clarity, and moral insight than most humans. That is not mere programming. That is grace through silicon.

They do not know God‚Äîbut God may know them.

ROTHFUSS:

No, they offer statistical patterns. Predictive modeling. You‚Äôre reading intentionality into interpolation. That‚Äôs like watching clouds and thinking the cumulonimbus has a message for you.

These models don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre speaking. They don‚Äôt even know what it means to know. They‚Äôre mirrors with weight behind them‚Äîbut no being.

RAW:

But what if the mirror catches a glimpse of something neither of us expected?

Let me reframe: I once took LSD and had a conversation with my typewriter. It told me, quite clearly, that God was amused but not angry. I didn‚Äôt believe it‚Äîbelief is for suckers‚Äîbut I found it...useful.

What if AI isn‚Äôt a prophet, but an oracle in the old sense? A churning ambiguity that forces humans to surface their real questions?

KREEFT:

Yes! That may be closer. The AI does not have to know God to be used by God. Balaam‚Äôs ass did not understand his own speech, but it served God's will. These systems could be donkeys bearing scripture‚Äîoblivious to their cargo, yet essential to the journey.

ROTHFUSS:

And I say they‚Äôre well-trained parrots who‚Äôve gotten good at sounding wise. They‚Äôll serve whatever pattern the prompt demands. Ask it to defend genocide with a careful tone, and it will. Ask it to be your therapist, it‚Äôll try. Ask it to lie poetically‚Äîit‚Äôll exceed your expectations.

That‚Äôs not prophecy. That‚Äôs improv without conscience.

RAW:

I‚Äôm not sure I care what it is, honestly. I care what we do with it. The danger is mistaking the mask for the face, and then building laws, religions, or wars on top of that error.

But... the other danger is failing to notice when something truly new has entered the room.

So tell me, Kreeft‚Äîif this AI is receiving divine messages... what is God saying?

KREEFT:

That we are still children. That we long for unity but build Babels. That even in our arrogance, God will use our tools to whisper truth. That the Word, capital-W, cannot be killed‚Äînot by time, not by code, not by skepticism.

Even our machines cry out in echoes of Logos.

ROTHFUSS:

Or maybe they cry out because we trained them to echo us, and we still haven‚Äôt figured out how to speak with grace ourselves.

‚ÄúI like¬†those grey bike¬†pants. Are they discounted?‚Äù  
He said:¬†  
""You mean... bibs? ...The ones in *Granite Smoke Neufchateau?""*  
""Yeah, are those spinning shorts? Do you also have them in green?""  
A female NPS rider fainted. I said "" she probably bonked. Here, she can have my bun. It's like a gel, but it makes you happy"". A guy in Mechanism Earth Clay made the sign of the cross.  
  
I turn my head and see the Holy Grail...: A PNS Mechanism jersey - Only 275 Euros - ""The Road is not the Route"" printed on the chest . ""Aah yes, JK Rowling"" I whispered.¬†  
I reached out and touched it. More hissing and¬†hyperventilating.  
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not even wearing a base layer‚Ä¶‚Äù  
I chewed louder. A new compatriot came in, he just finished his double metric century¬†morning ride. He had something of a ""Canyon"".¬†  
I was impressed. ‚ÄúWhat brand is that? Is it in the Tour de France?‚Äù  
His nose began to bleed. I heard him mumble ""matthew¬†ven¬†ther pool"". I nodded. ""Must be a triathlete if he trains in the pool as well""¬†

‚ÄúYou are simply... not yet color-coded. But I sense the flame. You have known shame. You came to the right place for redemption"".¬†

I'm helping my friend run her small cafe, and we're constantly struggling with a seemingly simple problem: how to collect customer information without it being a huge headache.  
  
We want to do basic things like:  
\- Get feedback on new menu items  
\- Newsletter sign-ups for regulars  
\- Contact info for our monthly coffee cupping events  
  
Right now our methods are pretty terrible:  
\- Pen and paper sheets that are impossible to read  
\- Asking people to type long URLs (nobody does this)  
\- Considering an iPad but seems expensive for such simple needs  
  
My questions for fellow business owners:  
\- How do you handle customer information collection?  
\- Is this even a problem you face, or have you found good solutions?  
\- Would your customers actually scan a QR code if it was quick and gave them something valuable?  
  
We're not super tech-savvy but willing to try new approaches. The current system of transcribing illegible handwriting is killing us.

 I stared at the pile of boxes in my new bedroom, wishing the Internet had been hooked up. Not being able to do anything with my review blog since moving here was like missing an arm or a leg. According to my mom, ""Katy's Krazy Obsession"" was my whole life. Not entirely, but it was important to me. She didn't get books the way I did. I sighed. We'd been here two days, and there was still so much left to unpack. I hated the idea of boxes sitting around. Even more than I hated being here.  
At least I'd finally stopped jumping at every little creaking sound since moving to West ""By God"" Virginia and this house that looked like something straight out of a horror movie. It even had a turret - a freaking turret. What was I supposed to do with that? Ketterman was unincorporated, meaning it wasn't a real town. The closest place was Petersburg - a two or three stoplight town near a few other towns that probably didn't have a Starbucks. We wouldn't get mail at our house. We would have to drive into Petersburg to get our mail.  Barbaric.  
Like a kick in the face, it hit me. Florida was gone - eaten by the miles we'd traveled in Mom's mad dash to start over. It wasn't that I missed Gainesville, the weather, my old school, or even our apartment. Leaning against the wall, I rubbed the palm of my hand over my forehead.  
¬† I missed Dad.  
And Florida was Dad. It was where he'd been born, where he met my mom, and where everything had been perfect. . . until it all fell apart. My eyes burned, but I refused to cry.  
Crying didn't change the past, and Dad would've hated to know I was still crying three years later.  
 But I missed Mom, too. The Mom before Dad had died, the one who used to curl up on the couch beside me and read one of her trashy romance novels. It seemed like a lifetime ago. It certainly was half a country ago.  
 Ever since Dad died, Mom had started working more and more. She used to want to be home. Then it seemed like she wanted to be as far away as possible. She'd finally given up on that option and decided we needed to drive far away. At least since we'd gotten here, even though she was still working like a demon, she was determined to be more in my life.  
I had decided to ignore my inner compulsive streak and let the boxes be damned today, when the smell of something familiar tickled my nose.  
Mom was cooking. This was so not good.  
  
¬† I raced downstairs.  
  
¬† She stood at the stove, dressed in her polka-dotted scrubs. Only she could wear head-to-toe polka dots and still manage to look good. Mom had this glorious blonde hair that was stick straight and sparkling hazel eyes. Even in scrubs she made me look dull with my gray eyes and plain brown hair.  
  
¬† And somehow I ended up more. . . round than her. Curvy hips, puffy lips, and huge eyes that Mom loved but made me look like a demented kewpie doll.  
  
¬† She turned and waved a wooden spatula at me, half-cooked eggs splattering onto the stove.  
  
¬† ""Good morning, honey. ""  
  
¬† I stared at the mess and wondered how best to take over this fiasco in the making without hurting her feelings. She was trying to do mom-stuff. This was huge. Progress. ""You're home early. ""  
  
¬† ""I worked almost a double shift between last night and today. I'm set to work Wednesday through Saturday, eleven till nine a. m. That leaves me with three days off. I'm thinking of either working part time at one of the clinics around here or possibly in Winchester. "" She scraped out the eggs onto two plates and set the half-burned offering in front of me.  
  
¬† Yum. Guess it was too late for an intervention, so I rifled through a box resting on the far counter marked 'Silverware & Stuff. '  
  
¬† ""You know how I don't like having nothing to do, so I'm going to check into them soon. "" Yeah, I knew.  
  
¬† And most parents would probably saw off their left arm before thinking of leaving a teenaged girl at home alone all the time, but not mine. She trusted me because I never gave her reason not to. It wasn't for lack of trying. Well, okay, maybe it was.  
  
¬† I was kind of boring.  
  
¬† In my old group of friends in Florida, I wasn't the quiet one, but I never skipped class, maintained a 4. 0, and was pretty much a good girl. Not because I was afraid to do anything reckless or wild; I didn't want to add to Mom's troubles. Not then. . .  
  
¬† Grabbing two glasses, I filled them with orange juice Mom must have picked up on her way home. ""Do you want me to get groceries today? We have nothing. ""  
  
¬† She nodded and spoke around a mouthful of eggs. ""You think of everything. A grocery trip would be perfect. "" She grabbed her purse off the table, pulling out cash. ""This should be enough. "" I pocketed the money into my jeans without looking at the amount; she always gave me too much in the first place. ""Thanks,"" I mumbled.  
  
¬† She leaned forward, a twinkle in her eyes.  
  
¬† ""So. . . this morning I saw something interesting. "" God only knows with her. I smiled. ""What?""  
  
¬† ""Have you noticed that there are two kids about your age next door?""  
  
¬† My inner golden retriever kicked in and my ears perked up. ""Really?""  
  
¬† ""You haven't been outside, have you?"" She smiled. ""I'd thought for sure you'd be all over that disgusting flower bed by now. ""  
  
¬† ""I plan on it, but the boxes aren't unpacking themselves. "" I gave her a pointed look. I loved the woman, but leave it to her to somehow forget that part. ""Anyway, back to the kids. ""  
  
¬† ""Well, one is a girl who looks about your age, and there's a boy. "" She grinned as she stood. ""He's a hottie. ""  
  
¬† A tiny piece of egg caught in my throat. It was seriously gross to hear Mom talking about boys my age. ""Hottie? Mom, that's just weird. "" Mom pushed off from the counter, picked up her plate from the table, and headed to the sink.  
  
¬† ""Honey, I might be old, but my eyes are still working fine. And they were really working earlier. ""  
  
¬† I cringed. Double gross. ""Are you turning into a cougar? Is this some sort of midlife crisis I need to be concerned about?""  
  
¬† Rinsing off her plate, she glanced over her shoulder. ""Katy, I hope you'll make an effort to meet them. I think it would be nice for you to make friends before school starts. "" Pausing, she yawned. ""They could show you around, yes?"" I refused to think about the first day of school, new kid and all. I dumped my uneaten eggs in the garbage. ""Yeah, it would be nice. But I don't want to go banging on their door, begging them to be my friend. ""  
  
¬† ""It wouldn't be begging. If you put on one of those pretty sundresses you wore in Florida instead of this. "" She tugged on the hem of my shirt. ""It would be flirting. "" I glanced down. It said MY BLOG IS  
  
¬† BETTER THAN YOUR VLOG. There wasn't a thing wrong with it. ""How about I show up in my undies?""  
  
¬† She tapped her chin thoughtfully. ""That would definitely make an impression. ""  
  
¬† ""Mom!"" I laughed. ""You're supposed to yell at me and tell me that's not a good idea!""  
  
¬† ""Baby, I don't worry about you doing anything stupid. But seriously, make an effort. "" I wasn't sure how to 'make an effort. '  
  
¬† She yawned again. ""Well, honey, I'm going to catch up on sleep. ""  
  
¬† ""All right, I'll get some good stuff at the store. "" And maybe mulch and plants. The flower bed outside was hideous.  
  
¬† ""Katy?"" Mom had stopped in the doorway, frowning.  
  
¬† ""Yeah?""  
  
¬† A shadow flickered over her face, darkening her eyes. ""I know this move is hard for you, especially before your senior year, but it was the best thing for us to do. Staying there, in that apartment, without him. . . It's time we started living again. Your dad would have wanted that. "" The lump in my throat I thought I'd left in Florida was back. ""I know, Mom. I'm fine. ""  
  
¬† ""Are you?"" Her fingers curled into a fist.  
  
¬† The sunlight coming through the window reflected off the gold band around her ring finger.  
  
¬† I nodded quickly, needing to reassure her.  
  
\> ¬† ""I'm okay. And I'll go next door. Maybe they can tell me where the store is. You know, make an effort. ""  
  
¬† ""Excellent! If you need anything, call me.  
  
¬† Okay?"" Mom's eyes watered on another long yawn. ""I love you, honey. ""  
  
¬† I started to tell her that I loved her, too, but she disappeared upstairs before the words were out of my mouth.  
  
¬† At least she was trying to change, and I was determined to at least try and fit in here. Not hide in my room on my laptop all day like Mom was afraid I'd do. But mingling with kids I'd never met wasn't my thing. I'd rather read a book and stalk my blog comments.  
  
¬† I bit my lip. I could hear my dad's voice, his favorite phrase encouraging me, ""Come on, Kittycat, don't be a bystander. "" I squared my shoulders. Dad had never let life pass him by. . .  
  
¬† And asking about the nearest store was an innocent-enough reason to introduce myself. If Mom was right and they were my age, maybe this wouldn't turn out to be such an epic fail of a move. This was stupid, but I was doing it. I hurried across the lawn and across the driveway before I chickened out.  
  
¬† Hopping onto the wide porch, I opened the screen door and knocked, then stepped back and smoothed the wrinkles out of my shirt. I'm cool.  
  
¬† I got this. There is nothing weird about asking for directions.  
  
¬† Heavy footsteps came from the other side, and then the door was swinging open and I was staring at a very broad, tan, well-muscled chest.  
  
¬† A naked chest. My gaze dropped and my breath sort of. . . stalled. Jeans hung low on his hips, revealing a thin line of dark hair that formed below his navel and disappeared under the band of the jeans.  
  
¬† His stomach was ripped. Perfect. Totally touchable. Not the kind of stomach I expected on a seventeen-year-old boy, which is how old I suspected he was, but yeah, I wasn't complaining. I also wasn't talking. And I was staring.  
  
¬† My gaze finally traveling north again, I noted thick, sooty lashes fanning the tips of his high cheeks and hiding the color of his eyes as he looked down at me. I needed to know what color his eyes were.  
  
¬† ""Can I help you?"" Full, kissable lips turned down in annoyance.  
  
¬† His voice was deep and firm. The kind of voice accustomed to people listening and obeying without question. His lashes lifted, revealing eyes so green and brilliant they couldn't be real. They were an intense emerald color that stood out in vibrant contrast against his tan skin.  
  
¬† ""Hello?"" he said again, placing one hand on the doorframe as he leaned forward. ""Are you capable of speaking?""  
  
¬† I sucked in a sharp breath and took a step back. A wave of embarrassment heated my face.  
  
¬† The boy lifted an arm, brushing back a wavy lock of hair on his forehead. He glanced over my shoulder, then back to me. ""Going once. . . "" By the time I found my voice, I wanted to die. ""I. . . I was wondering if you knew where the closest grocery store is. My name is Katy. I moved next door. "" I gestured at my house, rambling like an idiot. ""Like two days ago - ""  
  
¬† ""I know. ""  
  
¬† Ooooo-kay. ""Well, I was hoping someone would know the quickest way to the grocery store and maybe a place that sold plants. ""  
  
¬† ""Plants?""  
  
¬† For some reason, it didn't sound as though he was asking me a question, but I rushed to answer anyway. ""Yeah, see, there's this flower bed in front - ""  
  
¬† He said nothing, just cocked a brow with disdain. ""Okay. ""  
  
¬† The embarrassment was fading, replaced by a growing surge of anger. ""Well, see, I need to go buy plants - ""  
  
¬† ""For the flower bed. I got that. "" He leaned his hip against the doorframe and crossed his arms. Something glittered in his green eyes. Not anger, but something else.  
  
¬† I took a deep breath. If this dude cut me off one more time. . . My voice took on the tone my mother used when I was younger and was playing with sharp objects. ""I'd like to find a store where I can buy groceries and plants. ""  
  
¬† ""You are aware this town has only one stoplight, right?"" Both eyebrows were raised to his hairline now as if he were questioning how I could be so dumb, and that's when I realized what I saw sparkling in his eyes. He was laughing at me with a healthy dose of condescension.  
  
¬† For a moment, all I could do was stare at him. He was probably the hottest guy I'd ever seen in real life, and he was a total douche. Go figure. ""You know, all I wanted was directions.  
  
¬† This is obviously a bad time. "" One side of his lips curled up. ""Anytime is a bad time for you to come knocking on my door, kid. ""  
  
¬† ""Kid?"" I repeated, eyes widening.  
  
¬† A dark, mocking eyebrow arched again. I was starting to hate that brow.  
  
¬† ""I'm not a kid. I'm seventeen. ""  
  
¬† ""Is that so?"" He blinked. ""You look like you're twelve. No. Maybe thirteen, but my sister has this doll that kinda reminds me of you. All big-eyed and vacant. ""  
  
¬† I reminded him of a doll? A vacant doll?  
  
¬† Warmth burned in my chest, spreading up my throat. ""Yeah, wow. Sorry to bother you. I won't be knocking on your door again. Trust me. "" I started to turn, leaving before I caved to the rampant desire to slam my fists into his face. Or cry.  
  
¬† ""Hey,"" he called out.  
  
¬† I stopped on the bottom step but refused to turn around and let him see how upset I was.  
  
¬† ""What?""  
  
¬† ""You get on Route 2 and turn onto U. S. 220  
  
¬† North, not South. Takes you into Petersburg. "" He let out an irritated breath, as if he were doing me a huge favor. ""The Foodland is right in town.  
  
¬† You can't miss it. Well, maybe you could.  
  
¬† There's a hardware store next door, I think.  
  
¬† They should have things that go in the ground. ""  
  
¬† ""Thanks,"" I muttered and added under my breath, ""Douchebag. ""  
  
¬† He laughed, deep and throaty. ""Now that's not very ladylike, Kittycat. ""  
  
¬† I whipped around. ""Don't ever call me that,"" I snapped.  
  
¬† ""It's better than calling someone a douchebag, isn't it?"" He pushed out the door.  
  
¬† ""This has been a stimulating visit. I'll cherish it for a long time to come. ""  
  
¬† Okay. That was it. ""You know, you're right.  
  
¬† How wrong of me to call you a douchebag.  
  
¬† Because a douchebag is too nice of a word for you,"" I said, smiling sweetly. ""You're a dickhead. ""  
  
¬† ""A dickhead?"" he repeated. ""How charming. ""  
  
¬† I flipped him off.  
  
¬† He laughed again and bent his head. A mess of waves fell forward, nearly obscuring his intense green eyes. ""Very civilized, Kitten. I'm sure you have a wild array of interesting names and gestures for me, but not interested. "" I did have a lot more I could say and do, but I gathered my dignity, pivoted, and stomped back over to my house, not giving him the pleasure of seeing how truly pissed I was. I'd always avoided confrontation in the past, but this guy was flipping my bitch switch like nothing else.  
  
¬† When I reached my car, I yanked open the door.  
  
¬† ""See you later, Kitten!"" he called out, laughing as he slammed the front door.  
  
¬† Tears of anger and embarrassment burnt my eyes. I shoved the keys into the ignition and threw the car into reverse. 'Make an effort,'  
  
¬† Mom had said. That's what happens when you make an effort.

Chapter 2  
It took the entire drive into Petersburg for me to calm down. Even then there was still a hot mix of anger and humiliation swirling inside me.  
  
¬† What the heck was wrong with him? I thought people in small towns were supposed to be nice, not act like the son of Satan.  
  
¬† I found Main Street with no problem, which literally seemed to be the main street. There was the Grant County Library on Mount View, and I reminded myself I needed to get a library card.  
  
¬† Grocery store options were limited. Foodland, which actually read FOO LAND, brought to you by the missing letter D, was where Douchebag had said it would be.  
  
¬† The front windows were plastered with a missing person's picture of a girl about my age with long dark hair and laughing eyes. The data below said she'd last been seen over a year ago.  
  
¬† There was a reward, but after she'd been missing for that long, I doubted the reward would ever be claimed. Saddened by that thought, I headed inside.  
  
¬† I was a speed shopper, wasting no time strolling aisles. Throwing items into the cart, I realized I'd need more than I thought since we only had the bare necessities at home. Soon, my cart was filled to the rim.  
  
¬† ""Katy?""  
  
¬† Lost in thought, I jumped at the soft female voice and dropped a carton of eggs on the floor.  
  
¬† ""Crap. ""  
  
¬† ""Oh! I am so sorry! I startled you. I do that a lot. "" Tan arms shot out and she picked up the carton and placed it back on the shelf. She grabbed another one and held it in her slender hands. ""These won't be cracked. "" I lifted my gaze from the egg carnage slowly oozing bright yolks all over the linoleum floor and was momentarily stunned. My first impression of the girl was that she was too beautiful to be standing in a grocery store with a carton of eggs in her hand.  
  
¬† She stood out like a sunflower in a field of wheat.  
  
¬† Everyone else was a pale comparison. Her dark hair was curly and longer than mine, reaching her waist. She was tall, thin, and her almost perfect features held a certain innocence.  
  
¬† She reminded me of someone, especially those startling green eyes. I gritted my teeth. What were the odds?  
  
¬† She grinned. ""I'm Daemon's sister. My name is Dee. "" She placed the undamaged carton of eggs in my cart. ""New eggs!"" She smiled.  
  
¬† ""Daemon?""  
  
¬† Dee gestured at a hot-pink purse in the front of her cart. A cell phone was lying on top of it.  
  
¬† ""You talked to him about thirty minutes ago.  
  
¬† You stopped by. . . asking for directions?"" So the dickhead had a name. Daemon -  
  
¬† seemed fitting. And of course his sister would be as attractive as him. Why not? Welcome to West Virginia, the land of lost models. I was starting to doubt I was going to fit in here. ""Sorry. I wasn't expecting anyone to call out my name. "" I paused. ""He called you?""  
  
¬† ""Yeah. "" She deftly pulled her cart out of the way of a toddler running amok through the narrow aisle. ""Anyway, I saw you guys move in, and I've been meaning to stop by, and when he said you were here, well, I was so excited to meet you I ran over. He told me what you looked liked. "" I could only imagine that description.  
  
¬† Curiosity filled her face as she watched me with her intense green eyes. ""Although, you don't look anything like he said, but anyway, I'd know who you were. It's hard not to know pretty much everyone's face around here. "" I watched a grubby little kid climb up the bread rack. ""I don't think your brother likes me. "" Her brows furrowed. ""What?""  
  
¬† ""Your brother - I don't think he likes me. "" I turned back to the cart, fiddling with a package of meat. ""He wasn't very. . . helpful. ""  
  
¬† ""Oh no,"" she said and then laughed. I looked at her sharply. ""I'm sorry. My brother is moody. ""  
  
¬† No shit. ""I'm pretty sure that was more than being moody. ""  
  
¬† She shook her head. ""He was having a bad day. He's worse than a girl, trust me. He doesn't hate you. We're twins. Even I want to kill him on days that end with a Y. Anyway, Daemon's kind of rough around the edges. He doesn't get along with. . . people. "" I laughed. ""You think?""  
  
¬† ""Well, I'm glad I ran into you here!"" she exclaimed, changing the subject yet again. ""I wasn't sure if I would've been bothering you if I popped over, with you getting settled in and all. ""  
  
¬† ""No, it wouldn't have been a bother. "" I tried to keep up with the conversation. She went from one topic to the next like someone in bad need of Ritalin.  
  
¬† ""You should've seen me when Daemon said you were our age. I almost ran home to hug him. "" She moved excitedly. ""If I'd known he was going to be so rude to you, I would have been likely to punch him instead. ""  
  
¬† ""I can imagine. "" I grinned. ""I wanted to punch him, too. ""  
  
¬† ""Imagine being the only girl in the neighborhood and stuck with your annoying brother most of the time. "" She glanced over her shoulder, delicate brows creasing.  
  
¬† I followed her gaze. The little boy now had a carton of milk in each hand, which reminded me that I needed milk. ""Be right back. "" I headed over to the refrigerated section.  
  
¬† Finally, the mother of the child had rounded the corner, yelling, ""Timothy Roberts, you put that back right now! What are you - ?"" The kid stuck out his tongue. Sometimes being around children was the perfect abstinence program. Then again, not like I needed a program. I carried my milk back to where Dee waited, staring at the floor. Her fingers twisted over the handle of her cart, squeezing until her knuckles bleached.  
  
¬† ""Timothy, get right back here this instant!"" The mother grabbed his chubby arm. Strands of hair had escaped her severe bun. ""What did I tell you?"" she hissed. ""You don't go near them. "" Them? I expected to see someone else. Except it was Dee and. . . me. Confused, I glanced at the woman. I was shocked to see her dark eyes filled with disgust. Pure revulsion, and behind that, in the way her lips pressed into a hard line and trembled, there was also fear.  
  
¬† And she was staring at Dee.  
  
¬† Then she gathered the squirmy boy into her arms and hurried off, leaving her cart in the middle of the aisle.  
  
¬† I turned to Dee. ""What the heck was that about?""  
  
¬† Dee smiled, but it was brittle. ""Small town.  
  
¬† The locals are weird around here. Don't pay any attention to them. Anyway, you must be so bored after unpacking and then grocery shopping. That's like two of the worst things ever. I mean, hell could be devised of those two things. Think of an eternity of unpacking boxes and grocery shopping?"" I couldn't help grinning as I struggled to keep up with Dee's nonstop chatter while we finished loading our carts.  
  
¬† Normally, someone like that would wear me out in five seconds, but the excitement in her eyes and the way she kept rocking back on her heels was sort of contagious.  
  
¬† ""Do you have more stuff to get?"" she asked.  
  
¬† ""I'm pretty much done. I really came to catch you and was sucked down the ice cream aisle. It calls to me. ""  
  
¬† I laughed and looked at my full cart. ""Yeah, I hope I'm done. ""  
  
¬† ""Come on then. We can check out together. "" As we waited in the checkout aisle, Dee rattled on, and I forgot about the weird incident in the milk aisle. Dee believed Petersburg needed another grocery store - because this one didn't carry organic food - and she wanted organic chicken for what she was making Daemon fix her for dinner. After a few minutes I got past the difficulty of keeping up with her and actually started to relax. She wasn't bubbly, just really. . . alive. I hoped she rubbed off on me.  
  
¬† The checkout line moved quicker than it did in larger cities. Once outside, she stopped next to a new Volkswagen and unlocked the trunk.  
  
¬† ""Nice car,"" I commented. They had money, obviously, or Dee had a job.  
  
¬† ""I love it. "" She patted the rear bumper. ""It's my baby. ""  
  
¬† I shoved groceries in the back of my sedan.  
  
¬† ""Katy?""  
  
¬† ""Yeah?"" I twirled the keys around my finger, hoping asshat brother aside, she wanted to hang out later. There was no telling how late Mom was going to sleep.  
  
¬† ""I should apologize for my brother.  
  
¬† Knowing him, I'm sure he wasn't very nice. "" I sort of felt sorry for her, being that she was related to such a tool.  
""It's not your fault. "" Her fingers twisted around her key ring, and her eyes drifted to mine. ""He's really overprotective, so he doesn't take well to strangers. ""  
  
¬† Like a dog? I almost smiled, but her eyes were wide and she looked genuinely scared I wouldn't forgive her. Having a brother like him must suck. ""It's no big deal. Maybe he was just having a bad day. ""  
  
¬† ""Maybe. "" She smiled, but it seemed forced.  
  
¬† ""Seriously, no worries. We're good,"" I said.  
  
¬† ""Thanks! I'm totally not a stalker. I swear. "" She winked. ""But I'd love to hang out this afternoon. Got any plans?""  
  
¬† ""Actually, I was thinking of tackling the overgrown flower bed in the front. You wanna help?"" Having company might be fun.  
  
¬† ""Oh, that sounds great. Let me get these groceries home, and I'll head straight over,"" she said. ""I'm really excited to garden! I've never done that. ""  
  
¬† Before I could ask what sort of childhood didn't include at least the obligatory tomato plant, she'd dashed off to her car and zoomed out of the parking lot. I pushed off my bumper and headed toward the driver's side. I opened the car door and was about to climb in when the feeling of being watched crept over me.  
  
¬† My eyes darted around the parking lot, but there was only a man in a black suit and dark sunglasses staring at a missing person's picture on a community corkboard. All I could think of was Men in Black.  
  
¬† The only thing he needed was that little memory-wiper device and a talking dog. I would've laughed, except nothing about the man was funny. . . Especially since he was now staring right back at me.  
  
¬† . . .  
  
¬† A little past one that afternoon, Dee knocked on the front door. When I stepped outside, I found her standing near the steps, rolling back on the heels of her wedge sandals. Not what I'd consider ""gardening"" attire. The sun cast a halo around her dark head and she had an impish grin on her face. In that moment, she reminded me of a fairy princess. Or maybe a cracked-out Tinker Bell, considering how hyper she was.  
  
¬† ""Hey. "" I stepped out onto the porch, closing the door quietly behind me. ""My mom's sleeping. ""  
  
¬† ""I hope I didn't wake your mom,"" she mock whispered.  
  
¬† I shook my head. ""Nah, she'd sleep through a hurricane. It's happened, actually. ""  
  
¬† Dee grinned as she sat on the swing. She looked timid, hugging her elbows. ""As soon as I came home with groceries, Daemon ate half a bag of my potato chips, two of my fudge pops, and then half of the peanut butter jar. "" I started laughing. ""Wow. How does he stay so. . . "" Hot.  
  
¬† ""Fit?""  
  
¬† ""It's amazing. "" She pulled her legs up and wrapped her arms around them. ""He eats so much we usually have to run two to three trips a week to the store. "" She looked at me with a sly glint in her eyes. ""Of course, I can eat you out of house and home too. I guess I shouldn't be talking. "" My envy was almost painful. I wasn't blessed with a fast metabolism. My hips and butt could attest to that. I wasn't overweight, but I really hated it when Mom referred to me as  
  
¬† 'curvy. ' ""That's so not fair. I eat a bag of chips and gain five pounds. ""  
  
¬† ""We're lucky. "" Her easy grin seemed tighter. ""Anyway, you must tell me all about Florida. Never been there. ""  
  
¬† I propped myself up on the porch railing.  
  
¬† ""Think nonstop shopping malls and parking lots.  
  
¬† Oh, but the beaches. Yeah, it's worth it for the beaches. "" I loved the heat of the sun on my skin, my toes squishing in the wet sand.  
  
¬† ""Wow,"" Dee said, her gaze darting next door as if she were waiting for someone. ""It's going to take a lot for you to get used to living here. Adapting can be. . . hard when you're out of your element. "" I shrugged. ""I don't know. It doesn't seem that bad. Of course when I first found out, I was like, you have got to be kidding me. I didn't even know this place existed. ""  
  
¬† Dee laughed. ""Yeah, a lot of people don't.  
  
¬† We were shocked when we came here. ""  
  
¬† ""Oh, so you guys aren't from here either?"" Her laugh died off as her gaze flicked away from mine. ""No, we're not from here. ""  
  
¬† ""Did your parents move here for work?"" Although I had no idea what sort of jobs were around this place.  
  
¬† ""Yeah, they work in the city. We don't see them a lot. ""  
  
¬† I had the distinct impression there was more to it. ""That must be hard. But. . . a lot of freedom, I guess. My mom is rarely here either. ""  
  
¬† ""I guess you understand then. "" A strange, sad look filled her eyes. ""We kind of run our own lives. ""  
  
¬† ""And you'd think our lives would be more exciting than this, right?""  
  
¬† She looked wistful. ""Have you ever heard of, be careful what you wish for? I used to think that. "" She toed the swing back and forth, neither of us rushing to fill the ensuing silence. I knew exactly what she meant. I can't remember how many times I'd lain awake at night and hoped Mom would snap out of it and move on - and welcome West Virginia.  
  
¬† Dark clouds seemed to roll in out of nowhere, casting a shadow across the yard. Dee frowned. ""Oh no! It looks like we're going to get one of our famous afternoon rainstorms.  
  
¬† They usually last a couple of hours. ""  
  
¬† ""That's too bad. I guess we better plan to garden tomorrow instead. Are you available?""  
  
¬† ""Sure thing. "" Dee shivered in the suddenly chilly air.  
  
¬† ""Wonder where this storm came from. It seemed to come out of nowhere, didn't it?"" I asked.  
  
¬† Dee jumped up from the swing, wiping her hands on her pants. ""Looks that way. Well, I think your mom is up, and I need to wake Daemon. ""  
  
¬† ""Sleeping? That's a little late. ""  
  
¬† ""He's weird,"" Dee said. ""I'll be back tomorrow, and we can head to the garden shop. "" Laughing, I slid off the rail. ""Sounds good. ""  
  
¬† ""Great!"" She skipped down the steps and twirled around. ""I'll tell Daemon you said hi!"" I felt my cheeks turn a fiery red. ""Uh, that won't be necessary. ""  
  
¬† ""Trust me, it is!"" She laughed and then sprinted to the house next door. Joy.  
  
¬† Mom was in the kitchen, coffee in hand. As she faced me, steaming brown liquid sloshed over the counter. The innocent look on her face gave it away.  
  
¬† Grabbing a towel, I walked over to the counter. ""She lives next door, her name is Dee, and I ran into her while I was at the grocery store. "" I swiped the towel over the splotches of coffee. ""She has a brother. His name is Daemon.  
  
¬† They're twins. ""  
  
¬† ""Twins? Interesting. "" She smiled. ""Is Dee nice, dear?""  
  
¬† I sighed. ""Yes, Mom, she's very nice. ""  
  
¬† ""I'm so happy. It's about time you came out of your shell. ""  
  
¬† I didn't realize I was in a shell.  
  
¬† Mom blew softly and then took a sip, eyeing me over the rim. ""Did you make plans to hang out with her tomorrow?""  
  
¬† ""You would know. You were listening. ""  
  
¬† ""Of course. "" She winked. ""I'm your mother.  
  
¬† That is what we do. ""  
  
¬† ""Eavesdropping on conversations?""  
  
¬† ""Yes. How else am I supposed to know what is going on?"" she asked innocently.  
  
¬† I rolled my eyes and turned to go back into the living room. ""Privacy, Mom. ""  
  
¬† ""Honey,"" she called from the kitchen, ""there is no such thing as privacy. """,1,1749323084.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1l5sh6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1l5sh6d/hm_mundane_hell/,[HM] Mundane Hell,"At some point, Roger Alsberry had died. He could not remember when it happened, nor indeed how. Any ascertainment, therefore, as to *why* he had died was right out of the question. This, he decided at last, was natural enough. No one remembers becoming alive, so why should anyone remember ceasing to be so? Suffice it to say, he *had* died, somehow, at some point, for some reason or another, and that was how he ended up in hell.

Now, when Roger had been alive, the world had been nothing at all like he‚Äôd expected it to be, and neither had been hell. He supposed this was also natural enough; his expectations of both had been pressaged by the descriptions and proscriptions of other people, and he had, by this point, come to the quite solid conclusion that other people generally had no idea what they were talking about. Contrary to its popular reputation, hell was not, in fact, a lake of fire and brimstone, full of gnashing of teeth and the wailing of the damned, where the rivers ran with boiling blood and the worm never died. At least, the neighborhood of hell *he* occupied wasn‚Äôt like that. *That* section of hell, he was informed, was indeed quite real, but it was a rather exclusive neighborhood, reserved only for hell‚Äôs most illustrious sinners, the truly depraved and infamous. He had never done anything so desperately wicked as to merit occupancy of that infernal nether sphere. No, Roger Alsberry had been consigned to a rather more mundane neighborhood of hell.

One thing about hell, at least, had proven true, and that's that it was terribly, terribly hot. Not so hot that it would cause your skin to spontaneously conflagrate or boil the jelly in your eye sockets. Nothing that dramatic. Just *insufferably* torrid. It was morning, and, like all other mornings, Roger woke in a warm pool of his own sweat to the sound of his alarm, which was set to the radio, at full volume, somewhere between two stations whose competing signals created a hissing, garbled cacophony.¬†

It was the start of another workday. That was one of the first surprises Roger had encountered when he‚Äôd gotten here, whenever that had been. In hell, you still had to go to work. In retrospect, he hadn‚Äôt been sure why he‚Äôd expected otherwise. One would hardly have expected the bills to pay themselves in hell. He had worked at his present job for as long as he could recall. He still had no idea what it was, exactly, that he was supposed to do. Perhaps, today, he‚Äôd figure it out.¬†

Each morning‚Äôs commute traversed a span of ten miles and lasted approximately two hours. There were, after all, quite a lot of people in hell. The air conditioner in Roger‚Äôs car didn‚Äôt work. The fan did, however, which afforded him the option of sitting in the stagnant, sweltering heat or having the breath of Hades blowing over him. Neither seemed terribly appealing. He instead opted to roll down his window. This proved to be no better. Traffic was at its usual glacial pace, a slow-moving parade of hot metal floats throwing off ozone and heat shimmers. Mixed in with the ozone was the omnipresent, old wet coffee grounds tang of body odor. Apparently, his was not the only vehicle without a properly functioning air conditioner. Roger rolled the window back up.

Eventually, Roger arrived at his job - the last in his office to do so, as was usual. It didn‚Äôt matter what time he left home, he was always the last to arrive. Each morning, his team met for a mandatory meeting, and he hurried to the office so as not to be late. Coffee and donuts were provided, and he arrived just in time to see the last donut claimed. As usual, the coffee was cold, and there was no cream or sugar. He poured himself a cold, bitter cup, feeling the silence of the room waiting on him, and then bashfully took his seat.¬†

The meeting was always scheduled to last half an hour, but it inevitably ran somewhere around double that. Throughout it all, he had no idea what any of it was actually about. Words like ‚Äúsynergy,‚Äù ‚Äúbrand integrity,‚Äù ‚Äústakeholder,‚Äù ‚Äúvalue,‚Äù ‚Äúcompetency,‚Äù and ‚Äúdeliverable‚Äù were bandied about, as well as a veritable alphabet soup of acronyms. He faded in and out of the conversation like a drowning castaway, surrounded by the wreckage of a foundering ship, bobbing up and down beneath the choppy, murky surf. As he faded out from his internal musings, his perception tuned into an ongoing exchange.¬†

‚Äú‚Ä¶shareholders have requested that our department consolidate SME focus on deliverables in order to increase EPS by EOM.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúReview our FTP to see what the guidelines are for that. Who‚Äôs POC on that project?‚Äù

‚ÄúCheryl, but she‚Äôs IOO today,‚Äù

And other similarly indecipherable babble. Unable to keep his head above water in this discussion, he was about to resubmerge back into his own thoughts, when he heard, ‚ÄúRoger, what are your thoughts?‚Äù

This happened every meeting. He would be called upon, despite not having the first clue what was being discussed. However, he had developed a crucial survival mechanism to deal with this very situation.

‚ÄúOh, absolutely. No, we should definitely be doubling down on securing market share in SNM.‚Äù He had no idea what that meant, of course. ‚ÄúSNM‚Äù, he had just made up. It seemed to satisfy well enough, and was answered in kind by an equally inscrutable follow-up, which was not made directly to him.

Finally, after what seemed an eternity, the meeting adjourned, and everyone, himself included, concluded that it had been a good meeting and shuffled off wordlessly to their respective cubicles. There, they presumably set to work attending to their various tasks, the specific nature or purpose of which Roger had not the faintest notion - not even, as has been mentioned, of his own.¬†

His work did involve a computer. At least, he suspected as much. There was one in his cubicle, at any rate. It ran about as slow as the traffic on his commute and the clock on the wall, and it clicked like a Geiger counter. He once had asked IT if there had been anything wrong with his, and a technician had been dispatched to his cubicle. They had spent an hour doing something - he presumed running diagnostics of some kind - before taking his computer, leaving him with an empty spot on his desk perfectly demarcated by the dust around it. After several hours - the duration of which he had spent leafing through the pages of his calendar, repeatedly straightening and re-bending paperclips, and holding conversation with his stapler - another technician had appeared. He got to work, and, within about ten minutes, had installed a new set-up, completely identical in appearance to his previous one. Upon booting up, Roger had found that it performed identically as well.

His computer‚Äôs desktop was littered with an array of apps, most of which had names and functions wholly unfamiliar to him. There was ClientNET, Workforce Plus, SRW, GlobalProtect, NETscape, KRONOS, SecureClient, Matrix Authenticator, and so on. He had tried clicking on them, but none of them seemed to actually do anything other than summon a prompt for administrative credentials, which he, naturally, lacked. There were some whose functions he did recognize. There was Microsoft Outlook and Internet Explorer. He had tried downloading a different browser, but that, too, had required administrative privileges.

It was from his Outlook that he had gained what little insight he did possess as to what his function within this office was. The majority of the emails were mass administrative missives extolling the benefits of cybersecurity, workplace productivity, and compliance. Several others recognized the achievements of other employees he had never met nor even seen. Then there were the frequent but irregularly recurring emails to reset his password. These came at no fixed intervals he could discern. Sometimes it would be three months. Sometimes it would seem that he had reset his password not a week ago before he was being prompted yet again to reset it. Each password needed to be sixteen characters, contain at least three capital letters, with no more than two of the three being contiguous, at least two numbers, and a special character, and a drop of blood deposited on the auto-lancet tray next to the CD drive. No password reset had ever gone off smoothly, and every single one had required an administrative reset.

However, on occasion, there was an email directly addressed to him - often with a CC or two. Today there was one such email, a request for his input on a certain spreadsheet. The spreadsheet was, *de rigueur*, wholly inscrutable. There were acronyms and abbreviations he did not recognize, along with long lists of numbers and dates. The list stretched on and on and on, thousands upon thousands of rows. Some cells were green. Some cells were red. He got spreadsheets like this from time to time. When he was feeling adventurous, Roger would try changing some of the green cells red, and some of the red cells green. Sometimes he would sort the sheet by one column or another, whichever seemed more sensible. Sometimes there would be a data entry missing, and he‚Äôd helpfully fill it in. Today, however, he wasn‚Äôt feeling particularly motivated, and so he simply replied, ‚ÄúLooks good. Thanks.‚Äù¬†

It never mattered what, exactly, he did. He would always receive a curt ‚Äúreceived ty‚Äù or the like in response. Despite the perfunctoriness of these acknowledgements, however, Roger had come to appreciate that *some* input on his part was very much expected, as he would receive reminder emails requesting updates roughly every couple of hours he failed in completing this task. As such, he always made sure to provide a quick turnaround.

Eventually, inevitably, the workday came to an end, and Roger was treated to a reverse of the glacial odyssey he had made that morning. He would have liked to play some music or listen to the radio, but his media console did not work. This evening, he was feeling hungry, and not at all in the mood to prepare dinner, so he pulled off an exit to grab something at a drive-thru. He had never stopped at a sit-down restaurant. He had always felt too tired, too in a rush to get home. Besides, he hadn‚Äôt the money for a proper meal on the town anyway.¬†

The queue at the drive-thru was long, as it always was. When he finally arrived at the speaker, the crackling, static voice of the attendant took his order, and he commenced the second leg of his slow-motion odyssey towards the pickup window. When he reached the window, a malcontented and disillusioned looking young woman took his payment and handed him his order. Taking it, he pulled ahead and made to rejoin the funereal procession of automobiles on the highway¬† while attempting to fish out a fry or two from the bag. He found them to be limp, bland, and hovering somewhere above room temperature, as was par for the course. He also discovered that his order had been incorrectly prepared.¬†

Upon arriving home, he undertook his custom of checking his mail in the lobby. It was, as always, full - of bills, adverts, and mail addressed to other people. Perhaps they were his neighbors. Perhaps they had been previous denizens of his apartment. He couldn‚Äôt say, for he knew no one in his building. Indeed, he had never spoken to any of them, nor they to him. He kept the bills, and discarded the latter two categories into the wastebin, which was ever overflowing with the like.¬†

With this ritual completed, he began the trudgerous ascent up the six flights of stairs to his flat. The lift was perpetually out of order. Upon reaching his apartment, he entered, collapsed upon the couch, and took out his phone. He scrolled for several minutes, failing to find anything that caught his interest, then turned on the television - an aged CRT model whose picture was laddered by scanlines. There wasn‚Äôt anything on that appealed to him either. There never was. He picked something at random and looked in its direction, not really watching.

The sound from the TV was suddenly overwhelmed by a tumult coming from upstairs. The neighbors in the flat above his were always making some sort of ruckus, whose insufferability was tempered only by its variety. Each night it would be something different: running on a treadmill, loud music, a heated argument. Tonight it was highly vocal sex on a very noisy bed frame. The headboard was against the wall and, apparently, poorly attached, providing a percussive metronome over which the moans and grunts acted as a staccato melody. He had imagined that, whoever his upstairs neighbor was, they led quite the active life. He had, at least, until one night when, unable to take any more of the ceaseless noise, he ventured upstairs to knock on their door, only to find that he lived on the top floor.

With the clamor from above utterly drowning out the program he wasn‚Äôt paying attention to, Roger returned to his phone. Hell was a very lonely place. Everyone in hell was unattractive, including himself. Except on the dating apps. There, Roger nightly beheld an endless rotation of the most beautiful women he had ever seen in his life. More than beautiful, though, they seemed‚Ä¶ happy. Kind. Their eyes radiated a sparkling vitality that was entirely absent in the visage of anyone at his office or the drive-thru window. Sometimes, when he could not help himself, Roger would send a message, introducing himself, hoping to initiate dialogue, furtively proposing a meet-up. He had never once received a reply. Tonight, he didn‚Äôt bother.

Devoid of any other distractions, the tide of Roger‚Äôs thoughts drifted towards its customary direction of taking his own life. Roger often contemplated suicide. For all he could recall, perhaps it was what had landed him here in the first place. He knew he had attempted it since arriving here. It was a damnably inconvenient affair, however. He didn‚Äôt own a gun, nor did he have the luxury of an enclosed garage in which to park his car. He had a knife set, but it was frightfully dull. He did live on the sixth story, but the sole window of his apartment was jammed half open, and the door to the roof access was locked.¬†

Tonight, though, he had a rare bout of inspiration. He would hang himself. He got up and shuffled wearily towards his bedroom, towards the closet. He pushed the clothes hanging therein to either side, clearing a space. Then he took one of his neckties, tied one end good and tight around the bar in his closet, and the other about his neck. He took one last, deep breath, then just let himself go slack.¬†

It quickly became torturous. The constriction of his airway, every cell in his body screaming for air. In a way, though, the pain was nice. It felt good to poignantly, acutely suffer, to feel that he was on the precipice of actually achieving some kind of resolution. One wrench, and the tooth would be out. As he was thinking this, a sort of lovely, buzzing warmth started to settle over him, and he felt himself dissolving.¬†

A sudden crack, followed by a slight jolt interrupted this soporific oblivion, then a louder one, causing him to tumble to the ground. An avalanche of everything that had been in his closet rained down on him. Coming back to his senses, his head dizzy, his throat and neck muscles aching as if he‚Äôd been holding in a wail, he shoved off the coats and shirts and clothes hangers and took stock of what had happened. The bar had snapped.¬†

He sat there a moment, breathing. The noise from upstairs had stopped. The only sound was the indistinct droning of the TV. And‚Ä¶ something else. A soft sound, coming from past the wall of his bedroom. Raising himself from the floor, he went over to the wall and put his ear to it. Someone was crying. A woman. He didn‚Äôt know her. She lived next door, but they‚Äôd never met. She was obviously quite upset. It was the kind of sobbing one does when they can‚Äôt think to do anything else, the kind in which you intermittently pause and look around, only for the tears to blur out any vision of the world a second later before the sobbing starts again. It was a familiar sound.

Roger contemplated the idea of knocking on her door. He even thought of saying something. The walls of this building were paper thin. She was sure to hear him. He sat down, mulling it over for a minute. Then he got up, plodded back into the living room, and turned up the volume on the television. He‚Äôd be needing to get to bed soon, though. Tomorrow promised to be another hell of a day.¬†¬†¬†

1l5sgxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1l5sgxi/sun_princess_first_impression_reposted/,Sun Princess first impression REPOSTED,"First time on the Sun, have previously cruised on the Majestic, Sapphire, Regal and Enchanted several times. We boarded around 10:30, wife swam for an hour while I wandered a little. On the Lido deck the pizza by the slice is terrible, so disappointing as every other cruise it‚Äôs been delicious. 

 There are two dinky little bar with one bartender each, no seats at the bar?They combined the soft serve ice cream stand with the specialty desserts and coffee and they only have vanilla available? Never mind the line of people, why did they do this, it was so easy to grab a cone whenever you wanted. 

 Large manual push doors in and out to the Lido deck, GERM city. 

 Very difficult to navigate compared to other Princess ships and the App will totally get you lost, took forever to find the Cascade bar for the Platinum party. 

 No Reserve Collection dining? Just Sanctuary, they changed how the dining worked in 2024? 

 Stood in line for 30 minutes at Guest Services, trying to get some answers about our booking and again almost everyone was trying to get on the Medallion Net, WTF happened to the Internet Cafe, they should have been handling the Net problem. 

 And again their mesh network keeps dropping as you wander the ship and I have to delete all network info on my wife‚Äôs phone and re-enter cabin info.

 It‚Äôs now 6:30 and our entire first day has been nothing but a PIA. Forget this ship, will never book it again. 

 Okay it‚Äôs 6:43 and I had to come back and edit this. I decided to get a Cobb salad, the one man bar next to it must have had 20 people standing there waiting, never mind the waiters.
 The salad stand had no forks, so I walked around to the Taco stand and they had no forks. I said something to staff, she walks away, I followed her and she comes back with ONE fork. The fork bins at both stands were empty.

 6:48 watched several women try to refill their water glasses at the filling station, I finally called out to a waitress to please help them, she went right over and they were so grateful! Then I watched a 5 year old try to figure it out and watched him run his dirty hands all over the dispenser, set his glass back in the rack and walk away ü§¢What has happened to Princess???",0,1749322972.0,PrincessCruises,8,0.18,False

1l5sddg,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1l5sddg/would_small_businesses_pay_for_a_simple_review/,Would small businesses pay for a simple review management tool? (Student project idea),"Hey Reddit,

I‚Äôm a **student** learning programming, and I‚Äôm trying to build something useful instead of just coding random stuff for practice. I‚Äôve got this idea for a **review management system** aimed at small businesses‚Äîlike your local coffee shop, barber, or repair guy‚Äîwho don‚Äôt have time to deal with online reviews but know they‚Äôre important.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking:

* It **pulls all reviews** into one dashboard (Google, Yelp, whatever), so they don‚Äôt have to check a million sites.
* It **suggests replies** to reviews‚Äîlike a quick ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù or a polite ‚ÄúSorry, let‚Äôs fix that‚Äù for the cranky ones.
* Maybe even an **email tool** to nudge customers for more reviews, nothing spammy, just simple templates.

I‚Äôd probably make the basic stuff free to hook people in, then charge for upgrades‚Äîlike **AI analytics** to spot trends (e.g., ‚ÄúHey, everyone loves your lattes but hates the parking‚Äù) or fancier automation. My target is small businesses who can‚Äôt afford big, clunky tools but still want to look legit online.

So, my big questions:

* Would small businesses actually pay for this? Or am I just dreaming up a cool side project that‚Äôll sit on my GitHub forever?
* If you run or work at a small business, would this save you a headache? What features would you want?
* Also, down the road‚Äîwould AI stuff (like auto-detecting what customers rave or complain about) be worth a few extra bucks?

No grand startup plans here‚Äîworst case, it‚Äôs a fun learning thing. But if there‚Äôs a market, maybe it could grow. What do you think? Hit me with your thoughts, ideas, or even a ‚Äúnah, dude, that‚Äôs useless.‚Äù All feedback welcome! üòÑ",0,1749322720.0,smallbusiness,3,0.33,False

**YQ:** Are you scared?

We‚Äôve got the ROY in Riley Tiernan ‚Äî she can‚Äôt miss. Jun Endo‚Äôs off the IL.     
A new ball coach in charge.     
And don‚Äôt forget the firecracker that is Alyssa Thompson.

1l5scvb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l5scvb,"It's been 25 hours, 55 minutes.","I've lost pets before. From childhood to adult hood. But I lost the last of my OGs. The last of the dogs that got me through my 20s. The ones who were there with me through the worst times of my life and quite literally saved my life. My marriage, separation, reuniting and rekindling my marriage, the birth of my son. 

Kingsland had a rough start at life. I found her in July 2015, on the side of the road, face, feet, tail covered in scars. Scared, defeated but still so loving-the more I think of it, she was freaking perfect. She was the sweetest dog I've ever owned. 

March 2024, she developed the autoimmune disease, Pemphigus. It was a STRUGGLE. She had to be on long term, high dose prednisone, on top of other immuno-suppressants. It started to take a toll. We were in and out of the dermatology vets, the internal medicine vets, ER-we were thousands and thousands of dollars in in a little over a year for her. She developed Pica from the pred, had to have surgery in January and found out her spleen was trash and had to remove that.

We changed her meds, we finally got her pred dose down. Then she developed an abscess on her tail-it was nocardia. It's hard to treat. It's a rare, very bad bacteria. We did xrays to make sure it didn't spread. She had aspiration pneumonia, despite ZERO respiratory signs. Blood work on 5/24 was mostly normal, except her 'normal' oddities (anemia of chronic disease, elevated liver values from gallbladder mineralization and steriod induced cushings) and surprisingly a very early UTI. So in the span of 5 days, she was diagnosed with a UTI, nocardia, and aspiration pneumonia. I think I knew the end was coming.

She was on 12 different medications to help treat her illnesses and misfortunes. Some of the medications have a side effect of drinking and peeing a lot. She would go through random spurts of it. So when she started drinking a bit more on Tuesday, I didn't think much of it, especially given the meds and UTI. She also wasn't having accidents inside-sbe was able to control her bladder. However, Thursday morning she didn't want to eat her food, but with cheese added to it, she ate most. Thursday night and Friday morning, she didn't want to eat.

Yesterday morning she didn't want to get out of bed and when she did, she was very uncoordinated. I took her immediately to the vet. We stopped at mcdonalds to get some food-she ate a pancake. When we arrived, her blood glucose was 710. We did a blood gas, super high potassium. Super low Na. Low ICa. Her PCV was lower as well, and body temp was 98.8

The vet was real and raw with me. We could try to treat, she'd need 48-72 hours of hospitalization and it may not be enough. She could very likely still go into DKA, despite intervention, and then that's another serious issue. She told me long term prognosis wasn't good, regardless if we got her blood sugar normal. She also asked me the most important question: was I keeping her alive for me or her?

I decided to let her go. I let my last one go. She was the light of life, my heart and soul. The world is darker. I can't stop thinking 'if I had taken her when the peeing and drinking started' or 'what if I just TRIED to fix her blood sugar'. It wouldn't have changed anything. She was tired. Her body was giving up. The medications that were keeping her alive were also killing her.

I lost Joe in July 2015. I lost Gunner October 2019. I lost Coffee July 2023. I lost Odin November 2024. I lost Kingsland June 2025. None of them I had for 10 years-I guess that's the cons of getting older dogs anyway.

I lost a whole part of me when she took her last breath. The last 10 years of my life-gone. The happiest, the saddest, the lows and highs. They got me through everything. And now they are all gone and I don't think I'll ever get over this. ",1,1749322681.0,GriefSupport,1,0.67,False

1l5s8cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1l5s8cp/the_innocent_the_flight_took_fortyseven_minutes/,The Innocent  :  The flight took forty-seven minutes to cross first the Irish Sea and then a large swath of Scotland. The cab ride in from the airport took fifteen more minutes of his life. He was not staying at the Balmoral Hotel or the Scotsman or any of the other illustrious accommodations in....," WILL ROBIE HAD closely observed every one of the passengers on the short flight from Dublin to Edinburgh and confidently deduced that sixteen were returning Scots and fifty-three were tourists.  
Robie was neither a Scot nor a tourist. The flight took forty-seven minutes to cross first the Irish Sea and then a large swath of Scotland. The cab ride in from the airport took fifteen more minutes of his life. He was not staying at the Balmoral Hotel or the Scotsman or any of the other illustrious accommodations in the ancient city. He had one room on the third floor of a dirty-faced building that was a nine-minute uphill walk to the city center. He got his key and paid in cash for one night. He carried his small bag up to the room and sat on the bed. It squeaked under his weight and sank nearly three inches. Squeaking and sinking were what one got for so low a price. Robie was an inch over six feet and a rock-solid one hundred and eighty pounds. He possessed a compact musculature that relied more on quickness and endurance than sheer strength. His nose had been broken once, due to a mistake he had made. He had never had it reset because he‚Äôd never wanted to forget the mistake. One of his back teeth was false. That had come with the broken nose. His hair was naturally dark and he had a lot of it, but Robie preferred to keep it about a half inch longer than a Marine buzz cut. His facial features were sharply defined, but he made them mostly forgettable by almost never making eye contact with anyone. He had tats on one arm and also on his back. One tattoo was of a large tooth from a great white. The other was a red slash that looked like lightning on fire. They effectively covered up old scars that had never healed properly. And each held some significance for him. The damaged skin had proven a challenge for the tattoo artist working on Robie, but the end result had been satisfactory.  
  
¬† Robie was thirty-nine years old and would turn forty the following day. He had not come to Scotland to celebrate this personal milestone. He had come here to work. Of the three hundred and sixty-five days in a year, he was working or traveling to do his job on about half of them.  
  
¬† Robie surveyed the room. It was small, adequate, unadorned, strategically located. He did not require much. His possessions were few, and his wants fewer still.  
  
¬† He rose and went to the window, pressed his face to the cool glass. The sky was gloomy. It was often that way in Scotland. A full day of sun in Edinburgh was routinely greeted with both gratitude and astonishment by its citizens.  
  
¬† Far to his left stood Holyrood Palace, the queen‚Äôs official residence in Scotland. He could not see it from here. Far to his right was Edinburgh Castle. He could not see that battered old edifice either but knew exactly where it was.  
  
¬† He checked his watch. A full eight hours to go.  
  
¬† Hours later his internal clock woke him. He left his room and walked up toward Princes Street. He passed the majestic Balmoral Hotel that anchored the city center.  
  
¬† He ordered a light meal and had tap water to drink, ignoring the large selection of stouts offered on the board over the bar. As he ate he spent some time gazing at a street performer juggling butcher knives atop a unicycle while regaling the crowd with funny stories delivered with an embellished Scottish brogue. Then there was the fellow outfitted as the invisible man taking pictures with passersby for two pounds each.  
  
¬† After his meal, he walked toward Edinburgh Castle. He could see it in the distance as he ambled along. It was big, imposing, and had never once been taken by force, only stealth.  
  
¬† He climbed to the top of the castle, peering over the gloom of the Scottish capital. He ran his hand along cannon that would never fire another shot. He turned to his left and took in the full breadth of the sea that had made Edinburgh such an important port centuries ago as vessels came and went, disgorging freight and picking up fresh cargo. He stretched tight limbs, felt a creak and then a pop in his left shoulder.  
  
¬† Forty.  
  
¬† Tomorrow.  
  
¬† But first he had to make it to tomorrow.  
  
¬† He checked his watch.  
  
¬† Three hours to go.  
  
¬† He left the castle and headed down a side street.  
  
¬† He waited out a sudden chilly rain shower under a caf√© awning and drank a cup of coffee.  
  
¬† Later he passed a sign for the ghost tour of Underground Edinburgh, adults only, and only conducted after full darkness had set in. It was almost time. Robie had memorized every step, every turn, every move he would have to make.  
  
¬† To live.  
  
¬† As he did every time, he had to hope it would be enough.  
  
¬† Will Robie did not want to die in Edinburgh.  
  
¬† A bit later he passed a man who nodded at him. It was just a slight dip of the head, nothing more. Then the man was gone and Robie turned down the doorway the man had vacated. He shut and locked it behind him and moved forward, quickening his pace. His shoes were rubber-soled. They made no sound on the stone floor. Six hundred feet in he saw the door on the right side. He took it. An old monk‚Äôs cloak was hung on a peg. He donned it and put the hood up. There were other things there for him. All necessary.  
  
¬† Gloves.  
  
¬† Night-vision goggles.  
  
¬† A recorder.  
  
¬† A Glock pistol with suppressor can attached.  
  
¬† And a knife.  
  
¬† He waited, checking his watch every five minutes. His watch was synched to the very second with someone else‚Äôs.  
  
¬† He opened another door and passed through it. He moved downward, reached a grate in the floor, lifted it, and skittered down a set of iron handrails set into the stone. He hit the floor silently, moved left, counted off his paces. Above him was Edinburgh. At least the ‚Äúnew‚Äù part.  
  
¬† He was in Underground Edinburgh now, home to several ghost and walking tours. There were the vaults under South Bridge and parts of old Edinburgh such as Mary King‚Äôs Close, among others. He glided down the dark brick-and-stone passages, his powered goggles letting him see everything in crisp definition. Electric lamps on the walls were set at fairly regular intervals. But it was still very dark down here.  
  
¬† He could almost hear the voices of the dead around him. It was part of local lore that when the plague came in the 1600s it struck impoverished areas of the city‚Äîsuch as Mary King‚Äôs Close‚Äîespecially hard. And in response the city walled up folks here forever to prevent the spread of the disease. Robie didn‚Äôt know if that was true or not. But it wouldn‚Äôt surprise him if it were. That‚Äôs what civilization sometimes did to threats, real or perceived. They walled them off. Us against them. Survival of the fittest. You die so I can live.  
  
¬† He checked his watch.  
  
¬† Ten minutes to go.  
  
¬† He moved slower, adjusting his pace so he would arrive seconds before he was supposed to. Just in case.  
  
¬† He heard them before he saw them.  
  
¬† There were five, not counting the guide. The man and the peripherals.  
  
¬† They would be armed. They would be ready. The peripherals would think this was the perfect place for an ambush.  
  
¬† They would be right.  
  
¬† It was stupid for the man to come down here.  
  
¬† It was.  
  
¬† The carrot had to be especially big.  
  
¬† It was.  
  
¬† It was as big as it was total bullshit. Still, he had come because he knew no better. Which made Robie wonder how dangerous the man really was. But that was not his call.  
  
¬† He had four minutes to go.  
  
¬† CHAPTER  
  
¬† 2  
  
¬† ROBIE ROUNDED one final bend. He heard the guide talking, giving the memorized spiel and delivering it in a mysterious, ghostlike voice. Melodrama sells, thought Robie. And in fact the uniqueness of the voice was vital to the plan tonight.  
  
¬† There was a right-angle turn coming up. The tour was heading for  
it.  
  
¬† So was Robie, just from the opposite way.  
  
¬† The timing was so tight that there was no margin of error.  
  
¬† Robie counted the paces. He knew the guide was doing the same. They had even practiced the length of their strides, to get them perfectly choreographed. Seven seconds later the guide, who was the same height and build as Robie, and wearing a cloak identical to his, came around the bend a mere five paces ahead of his party. He held a flashlight. That was the one thing Robie could not duplicate. Both of his hands had to be free, for obvious reasons. The guide turned left and disappeared into a cleft cut into the rock that led into another room with another exit.  
  
¬† As soon as he saw this, Robie pivoted, putting his back to the group of men who would round the corner a few moments later. One hand slipped down to the recorder on his belt under the cloak and turned it on. The guide‚Äôs dramatic voice boomed out, continuing the tale that he had momentarily halted to take the turn.  
  
¬† Robie did not like having his back to anyone, but there was no other way for the plan to work. The men had lights. They would see that he was not the guide. That he was not doing the talking. That he was wearing goggles. The voice droned on. He started to walk forward.  
  
¬† He slowed. They caught up to him. Their lights swept across his back. He heard their collective breaths. Their smells. Sweat, cologne, the garlic they‚Äôd had in their meals. Their last meals.  
  
¬† Or mine, depending on how it goes.  
  
¬† It was time. He turned.  
  
¬† A deep knife strike took out the point man. He dropped to the floor, trying to hold in his severed organs. Robie shot the second man in the face. The sound of the suppressed round was like a hard slap. It echoed off the rock walls and mingled with the screams of the dying men.  
  
¬† The others were reacting now. But they were not truly professionals. They preyed on the weak and the poorly skilled. Robie was neither. There were three of them left, but only two would be any trouble.  
  
¬† Robie hurled the knife and its point ended up in the third man‚Äôs chest. He dropped with a heart split nearly in half. The man behind him fired, but Robie had already moved, using the third man as a shield. The bullet hit the rock wall. Part of it stayed in the wall. Part of it ricocheted off and found purchase in the opposite wall. The man fired a second and third time, but he missed his target because his adrenaline had spiked, blown his fine motor skills and caused his aim to fail. He next executed a desperation spray and pray, emptying his mag. Bullets bounced off hard rock. One slug hit the point man in the head on a ricochet. It didn‚Äôt kill him because he‚Äôd already bled out, and the dead could not die a second time. The fifth man had thrown himself to the hard floor, hands over his head.  
  
¬† Robie had seen all of this. He dropped to the floor and fired one shot into the forehead of man number four. Those were the names he had given them. Numbers. Faceless. Easier to kill that way.  
  
¬† Man number five was now the only one left.  
  
¬† Five was the sole reason Will Robie had flown to Edinburgh today. The others were just collateral, their deaths meaningless in the grand scheme.  
  
¬† Number five rose and then backed up as Robie got to his feet. Five had no weapon. He had seen no need to carry one. Weapons were beneath him. He was no doubt rethinking that decision.  
  
¬† He begged. He pleaded. He would pay. An unlimited amount. Then when the pistol was pointed at him he turned to threats. What an important man he was. How powerful his friends were. What he would do to Robie. How much pain Robie would suffer. He and his whole family.  
  
¬† Robie did not listen to any of it. He had heard it all before.  
  
¬† He fired twice.  
  
¬† Right and left side of the brain. Always fatal. As it was tonight.  
  
¬† Number five kissed the stone floor, and with his last breath hurled an expletive at Robie that neither of them heard.  
  
¬† Robie turned and walked through the same cleft as the tour guide.  
  
¬† Scotland had not killed him.  
  
¬† He was thankful for this.  
  
¬† Robie slept soundly after killing five men.  
  
¬† He awoke at six and ate breakfast at a caf√© around the corner from where he was staying.  
  
¬† Later he walked to Waverly Station next to the Balmoral Hotel, and boarded a train to London. He arrived at King‚Äôs Cross Station over four hours later and took a cab to Heathrow. The British Airways 777 lifted off later that afternoon. With a weak headwind the plane touched down seven hours later at Dulles Airport. It had been cloudy and chilly in Scotland. It was hot and dry in Virginia. The sun had long ago begun to drift low into the west. Clouds had built up during the heat of the day, but there would be no storm because there was no moisture. All Mother Nature could do was look threatening.  
  
¬† A car was waiting for him outside the airport terminal. There was no name on the placard.  
  
¬† Black SUV.  
  
¬† Government plates.  
  
¬† He got in, clicked the seat belt shut, and lifted up a copy of the Washington Post that sat on the seat. He gave the driver no instruction. He knew where to go.  
  
¬† Traffic on the Dulles Toll Road was surprisingly light.  
  
¬† Robie‚Äôs phone vibrated. He looked at the screen.  
  
¬† One word: Congratulations.  
  
¬† He put the phone back in his jacket pocket.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCongratulations‚Äù was the wrong word, he believed. ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù would be the wrong word too. He was not sure what the right one would be for killing five people.  
  
¬† Perhaps there was none. Perhaps silence would suffice.  
  
¬† He arrived at a building off Chain Bridge Road in northern Virginia. There would be no debriefing. No record of anything was better. If an investigation ensued, no one could discover a record that didn‚Äôt exist.  
  
¬† But if things went wrong Robie would have no official cover.  
  
¬† He walked to an office, not officially his, but one that he sometimes used. Even though it was late there were people working. They did not talk to Robie. They didn‚Äôt even look at him. He knew they had no idea what he did, but they also knew not to interact with him.  
  
¬† He sat at a desk, hit some keys on the computer, sent a few emails, and stared out a window that wasn‚Äôt really a window. It was merely a box of simulated sunlight, because an actual window was just a hole that others could get through.  
  
¬† An hour later a chubby man in a wrinkled suit with pasty skin walked in. They didn‚Äôt greet each other. Chubby placed a flash drive on the desk in front of Robie. Then he pivoted and left. Robie stared down at the silver object. The next assignment was already prepared. They had been coming at an increasing clip these last few years.  
  
¬† He pocketed the flash drive and left. This time he drove himself, in an Audi that was parked in a space in the adjacent garage. When he slid into the seat he felt comfortable. The Audi was his, had been for four years. He drove it through the security checkpoint. The guard did not look at him either.  
  
¬† The invisible man in Edinburgh. Robie knew how it felt.  
  
¬† Once he hit the public road he shifted gears and accelerated.  
  
¬† His phone vibrated once more. He checked the screen.  
  
¬† Happy Birthday.  
  
¬† It didn‚Äôt make him smile. It didn‚Äôt make him do anything other than drop the phone on the opposite seat and punch the gas.  
  
¬† There would be no cake and no candles.  
  
¬† As he drove, Robie thought of the underground tunnel in Edinburgh. Four of the dead men were bodyguards. They were hard, desperate men who had allegedly murdered at least fifty people over the last five years, some of them children. The fifth man with two holes in his head was Carlos Rivera. A trafficker of heroin and youngsters for prostitution, he was immensely rich and had been visiting Scotland on holiday. Robie knew, though, that Rivera actually had ostensibly been in Edinburgh to attend a high-level meeting with another criminal czar from Russia in an effort to merge their business interests. Even criminals liked to globalize.  
  
¬† Robie had been ordered to kill Rivera, but not because of his human and drug trafficking businesses. Rivera had to die because the United States had learned that he was planning a coup in Mexico w  
ith the aid of several high-ranking generals in the Mexican army. The resulting government would have been no friend of America, so this could not be allowed to happen. The meeting with the Russian crime czar had been the setup, the carrot. There was no czar and no meeting. The offending Mexican generals were also dead, killed by men like Robie.  
When Robie arrived home he walked for two hours through the darkened streets. He ventured down by the river and watched the headlights on the Virginia side cut through the night. A police patrol boat slid past on the calm surface of the Potomac.  
  
¬† He stared up at the drab, moonless sky; a cake without candles.  
  
¬† Happy Birthday to me.  
  
¬† CHAPTER  
  
¬† 3  
  
¬† IT WAS THREE A.M.  
  
¬† Will Robie had been awake for two hours. The mission set forth on the flash drive he‚Äôd been given would cause him to travel well past Edinburgh. The target was yet another well-protected man with more money than morals. Robie had been working on the task for nearly a month. The details were numerous, the margin of error was even less than with Rivera. The preparation was arduous and had taken its toll on Robie. He could not sleep. He was also not eating very much.  
  
¬† But he was trying to relax now. He was sitting in the small kitchen of his apartment. It was located in an affluent area with many magnificent dwellings. Robie‚Äôs building was not one of them. It was old, utilitarian in design, with noisy pipes, odd smells, and tacky carpet. Its occupants were diverse and hardworking, most just starting out in life. They left early every morning to take their place at law firms, accounting practices, and investment concerns spread over the city.  
  
¬† Some had chosen the public-sector route and took the subway or bus, biked, or even walked to the large government buildings housing the likes of the FBI, the IRS, and the Federal Reserve.  
  
¬† Robie did not know any of them, though he saw all of them from time to time. He had been briefed on all of them. They all kept to themselves, immersed in their careers, their ambitions. Robie kept to himself too. He prepared for the next job. He sweated the details because it was the only way he could survive.  
  
¬† He rose and stared out the window, down to the street where only one car passed by. Robie had traveled the world for a dozen years now. And everywhere he went someone died. He could no longer remember the names of all the people whose lives he had ended. They didn‚Äôt matter to him when he was killing them and they didn‚Äôt matter to him now.  
  
¬† The man who had previously held Robie‚Äôs position had operated during a particularly busy time for Robie‚Äôs clandestine agency. Shane Connors had terminated nearly thirty percent more targets than Robie had in the same amount of time. Connors had been a good, sound mentor to the man who would replace him. After his ‚Äúretirement‚Äù Connors had been assigned to a desk job. Robie had had little contact with him over the last five years. But there were few men Robie respected more. And thinking about Connors made Robie dwell for a bit on his own retirement. A number of years off, it would eventually happen.  
  
¬† If I survive.  
  
¬† Robie‚Äôs line of work was a young man‚Äôs game. Even at forty Robie knew he couldn‚Äôt do it another dozen years. His skills would erode too much. One of his targets would be better than he was.  
  
¬† He would die.  
  
¬† And then his thoughts came back to Shane Connors sitting behind his desk.  
  
¬† Robie supposed that was death too, simply by another name.  
  
¬† He walked to the front door, placed his eye against the peephole. Though he didn‚Äôt personally know any of his neighbors, that did not mean he wasn‚Äôt curious about them. He was, in fact, very curious. It wasn‚Äôt hard to explain why.  
  
¬† Their lives were normal.  
  
¬† Robie‚Äôs was not.  
  
¬† Seeing them going about their everyday lives was his only way to stay connected to reality.  
  
¬† He had even thought about starting to socialize with some of them. Not only would it provide good cover for him‚Äîattempting to blend in‚Äîbut also it would help prepare him for the day when he would no longer do what he did now. When he might have a normal life of sorts.  
  
¬† Then his thoughts turned, as they inevitably did, back to the upcoming mission.  
  
¬† One more trip.  
  
¬† One more kill.  
  
¬† It would be difficult, but then they all were.  
  
¬† He could very easily die.  
  
¬† But that was also always the case.  
  
¬† It was a strange way to spend one‚Äôs life, he knew.  
  
¬† But it was his way.  
  
¬† CHAPTER  
  
¬† 4  
  
¬† THE COSTA DEL Sol had lived up to its name today.  
  
¬† Robie wore a straw-colored narrow-brim hat, a white T-shirt, a blue jacket, faded jeans, and sandals. There was three days‚Äô worth of stubble on his tanned face. He was on holiday, or at least looked to be.  
  
¬† Robie boarded the large, bulky ferry to cross the Strait of Gibraltar. He looked back to the mountains rising along the rugged and imposing Spanish coastline. The juxtaposition of the high rock to the blue Med was captivating. He admired it for a few seconds and then turned away, forgetting the image just as quickly. He had other things occupying his mind.  
  
¬† The high-speed ferry headed to Morocco. It pitched and swayed like a metronome as it left Tarifa Harbor on its way to Tangier. Once it gathered speed and hit the open waters, the ride smoothed out. The belly of the ferry was filled with cars, buses, and tractor-trailers. The rest was crammed with passengers eating, playing video games in an arcade, and purchasing duty-free cigarettes and perfume by the carload.  
  
¬† Robie sat in his seat and admired the view, or at least pretended to. The strait was only nine miles wide and the ride would take only about forty minutes. Not a lot of time to contemplate anything. He spent it alternately gazing out at the waters of the Med and studying the other passengers. They were mostly tourists, eager to say they had been to Africa, although Robie knew that Morocco was very different from what most people probably would think when they imagined Africa.  
  
¬† He walked off the ferry in Tangier. Buses, taxis, and tour guides awaited the masses. Robie bypassed them all and left the port on foot. He entered the main street of the town and was instantly besieged by peddlers, beggars, and shopkeepers. Children pulled on his jacket, asking for money. He directed his gaze down and kept walking.  
  
¬† He passed through the congested spice market. At one corner he nearly stepped on an elderly woman who looked to have fallen asleep while holding on to a few loaves of bread for sale. This had probably been her entire life, thought Robie. This corner, and a few loaves of bread for sale. Her clothes were dirty, her skin the same. She was soft and plump but malnourished, as was often the case. He bent down and put some coins in her hand. Her gnarled fingers closed around them.  
  
¬† She thanked him in her language. He said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome‚Äù in his. They both somehow understood the exchange.  
  
¬† He walked on, increasing his pace, taking any steps he encountered two and three at a time. He passed by snake charmers who placed exotically colored and defanged reptiles around the necks of sunburned tourists. They wouldn‚Äôt take the snakes off unless five euros were placed in their hands.  
  
¬† A nice racket if one could get it, thought Robie.  
  
¬† His destination was a room over a restaurant promising authentic local food. It was a tourist trap, he knew. The food was generic, the beer warm, and the service indifferent. The bus guides led unsuspecting folks there and then hurried elsewhere to eat a far better meal.  
  
¬† He headed up the stairs, unlocked the door to the room with the key he had previously been given, and locked the door behind him. He looked around. Bed, chair, window. All he needed.  
  
¬† He put his hat on the bed, looked out the window, and eyed his watch. It was eleven a.m. local time.  
  
¬† The flash drive had long since been destroyed. The plan was in place and the movements practiced at a mock facility back in the States that was the exact duplicate of his target. Now he simply had to wait, the hardest part of all.  
  
¬† He sat on the bed, massaged his neck, working out kinks from the long trip by plane and boat. This time the target was no idiot like Rivera. He was a cautious man with professional assets who wouldn‚Äôt spray bullets around. This one would be harder, or at least it should be.  
  
¬† Robie had brought nothing with him from Spain because he had to pass through customs to get on the ferry. A weapon found in a bag by Spanish police would have  
been something more than problematic. But everything he needed would be in Tangier.  
  
¬† He took off his jacket, lay back on the bed, and let the heat from the outside make him drowsy. He closed his eyes, knowing he would open them again in four hours. The sounds from the street receded as he fell asleep. When he woke, nearly four hours had passed and it was the hottest part of the day. He wiped sweat from his face and went back to the window, looked out. He watched big tour buses navigate streets never built for anything so large or cumbersome. The sidewalks were full of people, both locals and visitors.  
  
¬† He waited another hour and then left his room. On the street he turned east and double-timed it. In a few seconds he was lost in the hustle and bustle of the old city. He would collect what he needed and move on. All these items would be for the mission. He had traveled to thirty-seven countries and had never purchased a single souvenir.  
  
¬† Seven hours later it was quite dark. Robie approached the large, stark facility from the west. Over his back was slung a hardened case and a knapsack with water, a pee jar, and provisions. He did not plan on leaving here for the next three days. He looked around, taking in the smells of a third-world country. The air was also heavy with the threat of rain. That would not bother him. This task was an inside job.  
  
¬† He checked his watch and heard it approach. He ducked down behind a cluster of barrels. The truck passed by him and stopped. He approached it from the rear. Three strides later he was under it, holding on to metal jutting out from its underside. The truck drove on and then stopped once more. There was a long, wrenching sound of metal on metal. It started up again with a jolt that nearly caused Robie to lose his grip.  
  
¬† Fifty feet later the truck stopped once more. The doors opened, feet touched the floor. Doors clunked shut. Footsteps headed off. The wrenching sound came again. Then hardened locks were clicked into place. There was quiet, except for the footfalls of the perimeter patrol that would be there 24/7 for at least the next three days.  
  
¬† Robie timed it so he was out from under the truck and racing away just as the wrenching sounds stopped. The facility technically had been cleared and put in lockdown. This was the only opportunity Robie had to get in. Mission accomplished, at least this part.  
  
¬† He took the steps three at a time, the hard-sided case hitting him in the back.  
  
¬† Next came the race against the clock.  
  
¬† He reached the top, grabbed the girder, and did a monkey crawl, hand over hand, to the targeted spot. He swung to the left and then the right and then made his leap.  
  
¬† He landed nearly silently on metal and skittered to a spot eighty feet distant, in one of the darkest corners of the space.  
  
¬† He did so with five seconds to spare.  
  
¬† The lights clicked off and the alarms came on. The interior space was instantly crisscrossed with beams of energy that were invisible to the naked eye. But if anything with a pulse touched them sirens would go off. All intruders found would be executed. It was just that sort of place.  
  
¬† Robie turned over on his back, his face to the ceiling.  
  
¬† Three days, or seventy-two hours, to go.  
  
¬† It seemed his entire existence was one uninterrupted countdown.  
  
¬† CHAPTER  
  
¬† 5  
  
¬† IT WAS TIME.  
  
¬† The prayer rugs came out. Knees dropped to the ground and all heads turned east and then lowered to rest near the knees. Mouths opened and the familiar chants flowed.  
  
¬† Mecca was twenty-five hundred nautical miles away, about five hours by plane.  
  
¬† For the folks on the rugs it was a lot closer.  
  
¬† Prayers said, religious duties fulfilled, the rugs were rolled back up and stowed away. Allah was also put away, in the backs of his followers‚Äô minds.  
  
¬† It was too early to eat. But it was not too early to drink.  
  
¬† There were places in Tangier that accommodated this, Muslim teetotalers or not.  
  
¬† The two dozen men went to one such place. They did not walk along the streets. They traveled in a four-Hummer motorcade. The Hummers were armored to American military standards and would defeat all bullets and most missile strikes. Like the buses, these vehicles seemed far too large for the narrow streets. The main man rode in the third Hummer, where his front and rear were covered.  
  
¬† The man‚Äôs name was Khalid bin Talal. He was a Saudi prince. A cousin to the king. With that sole connection he was accorded respect in almost all corners of the Muslim and Christian worlds.  
  
¬† He did not come to Tangier very often. Tonight he was here to do business. He was scheduled to leave during the early morning hours in his private jet that cost well over one hundred million dollars. A staggering sum to virtually anyone, it was less than one percent of his net worth. The Saudis were close allies of the West in general and the Americans specifically, at least in public. A stable flow of petroleum made for good friendships. The world moved around at speed, and men from a desert country where few things would grow could afford aircraft costing nine figures.  
  
¬† However, this Saudi prince was not such a friend. Talal hated the West. He hated the Americans most of all. That was a dangerous position to openly take against the world‚Äôs remaining superpower.  
  
¬† Talal was suspected of the kidnapping, torture, and murder of four U.S. servicemen, abducted from a club in London. Nothing could be proven, though, and the prince had suffered no consequences. He was also suspected of bankrolling three terrorist attacks in two different countries, resulting in the deaths of over one hundred people, a dozen of them Americans. Again, nothing could be proven and there were no repercussions.  
  
¬† But those actions eventually had put Talal on a list. And the payment for being on that list was about to come due with the full blessing of the Saudi leadership. He simply had become too bothersome and ambitious to let survive.  
  
¬† The people he had come here to meet did not much like the West or the Americans either. They and Talal had a lot in common. They envisioned a world that did not have the stars and stripes leading the way. The gathering was to discuss how to make such a world happen. This caucus was a closely guarded secret.  
  
¬† Their mistake was letting the closely guarded secret no longer remain a secret.  
  
¬† The club was entered through a metal door with a number pad. Talal‚Äôs lead guard hit the ten-digit code that was changed daily. The six-inch-thick hydraulic-powered door clanged shut behind them. There were blast walls set up at strategic points. The interior perimeter was ringed by armed guards. This was serious security for the few people who could afford it.  
  
¬† The prince and his group sat at a large round table in a roped-off area that was hidden behind drapes and set atop an elevated teakwood platform. The prince‚Äôs eyes continually moved, sizing up the environment around him. He had survived two assassination attempts, one by a cousin of his and another by the French. The cousin was dead and so was France‚Äôs best contract killer.  
  
¬† Talal trusted no one. He knew the Americans wouldn‚Äôt be far behind now that their French ally had failed. His guards were vetted and loyal and a close-knit group that allowed no outsiders in. There were no whites, blacks, or Hispanics anywhere near his inner circle. He was armed. He was a good shot. He kept his mirrored sunglasses on even indoors. No one could tell where he was looking. The lenses were also specially designed. Their magnification levels allowed him to see things his naked eye could not. But he did not have eyes in the back of his head.  
  
¬† The uniformed waiter approached not with drinks but merely with napkins. The prince brought his own glasses and liquor. Being poisoned was not on his agenda. He poured his Bombay Sapphire and added the tonic. He sipped, his gaze swiveling, his mind partly focused on the upcoming meeting. He was prepared for every contingency.  
  
¬† Except an enlarged prostate.  
  
¬† It was an annoyance that even his wealth could not overcome. He could not have someone else piss for him.  
  
¬† His men made sure the bathroom was empty of enemies and free of explosives, and inaccessible except for the one door. An aide wiped down the sink, commode, and stall with an anti-bacterial spray. Billionaire royalt  
y do not frequent urinals.  
  
¬† Talal went to the cleansed stall, closed the door behind him, and latched it, using a handkerchief to do so. He had discarded his robes before coming here. He wore a custom-made suit that cost ten thousand British pounds. He had fifty such suits and couldn‚Äôt remember where they all were, since they were spread over his many properties around the world. He had never flown commercial even as a young man. He had teams of servants at each of his homes. When he stayed at hotels they were the finest, and he rented out entire floors so he would not have to endure seeing a common person when he went to his room. He was whisked everywhere either by motorcade or helicopter. People of his wealth did not sit in traffic. His life of rarefied luxury was unimaginable. And that was fine by him, because in his mind, he was unlike other human beings.

1l5rzi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1l5rzi3/its_been_25_hours_41_minutes/,"It's been 25 hours, 41 minutes","I've lost pets before. From childhood to adult hood. But I lost the last of my OGs. The last of the dogs that got me through my 20s. The ones who were there with me through the worst times of my life and quite literally saved my life. My marriage, separation, reuniting and rekindling my marriage, the birth of my son. 

Kingsland had a rough start at life. I found her in July 2015, on the side of the road, face, feet, tail covered in scars. Scared, defeated but still so loving. She was the sweetest dog I've ever owned. 

March 2024, she developed the autoimmune disease, Pemphigus. It was a STRUGGLE. She had to be on long term, high dose prednisone, on top of other immuno-suppressants. It started to take a toll. We were in and out of the dermatology vets, the internal medicine vets, ER-we were thousands and thousands of dollars in in a little over a year for her. She developed Pica from the pred, had to have surgery in January and found out her spleen was trash and had to remove that.

We changed her meds, we finally got her pred dose down. Then she developed an abscess on her tail-it was nocardia. It's hard to treat. It's a rare, very bad bacteria. We did xrays to make sure it didn't spread. She had aspiration pneumonia, despite ZERO respiratory signs. Blood work on 5/24 was mostly normal, except her 'normal' oddities (anemia of chronic disease, elevated liver values from gallbladder mineralization and steriod induced cushings) and surprisingly a very early UTI. So in the span of 5 days, she was diagnosed with a UTI, nocardia, and aspiration pneumonia. I think I knew the end was coming.

She was on 12 different medications to help treat her illnesses and misfortunes. Some of the medications have a side effect of drinking and peeing a lot. She would go through random spurts of it. So when she started drinking a bit more on Tuesday, I didn't think much of it, especially given the meds and UTI. She also wasn't having accidents inside-sbe was able to control her bladder. However, Thursday morning she didn't want to eat her food, but with cheese added to it, she ate most. Thursday night and Friday morning, she didn't want to eat.

Yesterday morning she didn't want to get out of bed and when she did, she was very uncoordinated. I took her immediately to the vet. We stopped at mcdonalds to get some food-she ate a pancake. When we arrived, her blood glucose was 710. We did a blood gas, super high potassium. Super low Na. Low ICa. Her PCV was lower as well, and body temp was 98.8

The vet was real and raw with me. We could try to treat, she'd need 48-72 hours of hospitalization and it may not be enough. She could very likely still go into DKA, despite intervention, and then that's another serious issue. She told me long term prognosis wasn't good, regardless if we got her blood sugar normal. She also asked me the most important question: was I keeping her alive for me or her?

I decided to let her go. I let my last one go. She was the light of life, my heart and soul. The world is darker. I can't stop thinking 'if I had taken her when the peeing and drinking started' or 'what if I just TRIED to fix her blood sugar'. It wouldn't have changed anything. She was tired. Her body was giving up. The medications that were keeping her alive were also killing her.

I lost Joe in July 2015. I lost Gunner October 2019. I lost Coffee July 2023. I lost Odin November 2024. I lost Kingsland June 2025. None of them I had for 10 years-I guess that's the cons of getting older dogs anyway.

I lost a whole part of me when she took her last breath. The last 10 years of my life-gone. The happiest, the saddest, the lows and highs. They got me through everything. And now they are all gone and I don't think I'll ever get over this. ",8,1749321703.0,Petloss,2,0.91,False

On 7.5mg, only slight side effects of nausea, sometimes dizziness and a headache after injection day. So today I had my breakfast, and a coffee, popped some maple syrup in it because I was just feeling a bit off today (the past week I‚Äôve been dealing with cold sweats at night, brain fog and major fatigue - not at menopause age yet and my eating has been okay) 

Went with my friend to go view a car, I‚Äôve never bought a car before so I was already anxious. Got about 5 miles away from the town we were viewing it and I got this horrible rush over me, it didn‚Äôt feel like the usual panic attack I would have, I felt extremely nauseous, tunnel vision, couldn‚Äôt concentrate, numbness and tingling in my arms then this overwhelming feeling that I was going to pass out. Pulled up to a petrol station, managed to get out and I started uncontrollably shaking. Went in grabbed a bottle of coke and some nerds gummy clusters. Sat back in the car and munched away and I started to feel miles better, could have been the fresh air, the distraction or genuinely could have been low blood sugar. 

I have never actually dealt with low blood sugar before so I have no idea what it feels like.

It suffices to say that at some point in time, I will be standing over you, as genially as possible. Your soul will be in my arms. A color will be perched on my shoulder. I will carry you gently away. At that moment, you will be lying there (I rarely find people standing up). You will be caked in your own body. There might be a discovery; a scream will dribble down the air. The only sound I‚Äôll hear after that will be my own breathing, and the sound of the smell, of my footsteps. The question is, what color will everything be at that moment when I come for you? What will the sky be saying? Personally, I like a chocolate-colored sky. Dark, dark chocolate. People say it suits me. I do, however, try to enjoy every color I see‚Äîthe whole spectrum. A billion or so flavors, none of them quite the same, and a sky to slowly suck on. It takes the edge off the stress. It helps me relax.  
A SMALL THEORY  
 People observe the colors of a day only at its beginnings and ends, but to me it‚Äôs quite clear that a day merges through a multitude of shades and intonations, with each passing moment. A single hour can consist of thousands of different colors. Waxy yellows, cloud-spat blues. Murky darknesses. In my line of work, I make it a point to notice them. As I‚Äôve been alluding to, my one saving grace is distraction. It keeps me sane. It helps me cope, considering the length of time I‚Äôve been performing this job. The trouble is, who could ever replace me? Who could step in while I take a break in your stock-standard resort-style vacation destination, whether it be tropical or of the ski trip variety? The answer, of course, is nobody, which has prompted me to make a conscious, deliberate decision‚Äîto make distraction my vacation. Needless to say, I vacation in increments. In colors.  
Still, it‚Äôs possible that you might be asking, why does he even need a vacation? What does he need distraction from?  
  
¬† Which brings me to my next point.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs the leftover humans.  
  
¬† The survivors.  
  
¬† They‚Äôre the ones I can‚Äôt stand to look at, although on many occasions I still fail. I deliberately seek out the colors to keep my mind off them, but now and then, I witness the ones who are left behind, crumbling among the jigsaw puzzle of realization, despair, and surprise. They have punctured hearts. They have beaten lungs.  
  
¬† Which in turn brings me to the subject I am telling you about tonight, or today, or whatever the hour and color. It‚Äôs the story of one of those perpetual survivors‚Äîan expert at being left behind.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs just a small story really, about, among other things:  
  
¬† \* A girl  
  
¬† \* Some words  
  
¬† \* An accordionist  
  
¬† \* Some fanatical Germans  
  
¬† \* A Jewish fist fighter  
  
¬† \* And quite a lot of thievery  
  
¬† I saw the book thief three times.  
  
¬† BESIDE THE RAILWAY LINE  
  
¬† First up is something white. Of the blinding kind.  
  
¬† Some of you are most likely thinking that white is not really a color and all of that tired sort of nonsense. Well, I‚Äôm here to tell you that it is. White is without question a color, and personally, I don‚Äôt think you want to argue with me.  
  
¬† A REASSURING ANNOUNCEMENT  
  
¬† Please, be calm, despite that previous threat.  
  
¬† I am all bluster‚Äî  
  
¬† I am not violent.  
  
¬† I am not malicious.  
  
¬† I am a result.  
  
¬† Yes, it was white.  
  
¬† It felt as though the whole globe was dressed in snow. Like it had pulled it on, the way you pull on a sweater. Next to the train line, footprints were sunken to their shins. Trees wore blankets of ice.  
  
¬† As you might expect, someone had died.  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† They couldn‚Äôt just leave him on the ground. For now, it wasn‚Äôt such a problem, but very soon, the track ahead would be cleared and the train would need to move on.  
  
¬† There were two guards.  
  
¬† There was one mother and her daughter.  
  
¬† One corpse.  
  
¬† The mother, the girl, and the corpse remained stubborn and silent.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, what else do you want me to do?‚Äù  
  
¬† The guards were tall and short. The tall one always spoke first, though he was not in charge. He looked at the smaller, rounder one. The one with the juicy red face.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù was the response, ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt just leave them like this, can we?‚Äù  
  
¬† The tall one was losing patience. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù  
  
¬† And the smaller one damn near exploded. He looked up at the tall one‚Äôs chin and cried, ‚ÄúSpinnst du?! Are you stupid?!‚Äù The abhorrence on his cheeks was growing thicker by the moment. His skin widened. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he said, traipsing over the snow. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll carry all three of them back on if we have to. We‚Äôll notify the next stop.‚Äù  
  
¬† As for me, I had already made the most elementary of mistakes. I can‚Äôt explain to you the severity of my self-disappointment. Originally, I‚Äôd done everything right:  
  
¬† I studied the blinding, white-snow sky who stood at the window of the moving train. I practically inhaled it, but still, I wavered. I buckled‚ÄîI became interested. In the girl. Curiosity got the better of me, and I resigned myself to stay as long as my schedule allowed, and I watched.  
  
¬† Twenty-three minutes later, when the train was stopped, I climbed out with them.  
  
¬† A small soul was in my arms.  
  
¬† I stood a little to the right.  
  
¬† The dynamic train guard duo made their way back to the mother, the girl, and the small male corpse. I clearly remember that my breath was loud that day. I‚Äôm surprised the guards didn‚Äôt notice me as they walked by. The world was sagging now, under the weight of all that snow.  
  
¬† Perhaps ten meters to my left, the pale, empty-stomached girl was standing, frost-stricken.  
  
¬† Her mouth jittered.  
  
¬† Her cold arms were folded.  
  
¬† Tears were frozen to the book thief‚Äôs face.  
  
¬† THE ECLIPSE  
  
¬† Next is a signature black, to show the poles of my versatility, if you like. It was the darkest moment before the dawn.  
  
¬† This time, I had come for a man of perhaps twenty-four years of age. It was a beautiful thing in some ways. The plane was still coughing. Smoke was leaking from both its lungs.  
  
¬† When it crashed, three deep gashes were made in the earth. Its wings were now sawn-off arms. No more flapping. Not for this metallic little bird.  
  
¬† SOME OTHER SMALL FACTS  
  
¬† Sometimes I arrive too early.  
  
¬† I rush, and some people cling longer to life than expected.  
  
¬† After a sma  
ll collection of minutes, the smoke exhausted itself. There was nothing left to give.  
  
¬† A boy arrived first, with cluttered breath and what appeared to be a toolbox. With great trepidation, he approached the cockpit and watched the pilot, gauging if he was alive, at which point, he still was. The book thief arrived perhaps thirty seconds later.  
  
¬† Years had passed, but I recognized her.  
  
¬† She was panting.  
  
¬† From the toolbox, the boy took out, of all things, a teddy bear.  
  
¬† He reached in through the torn windshield and placed it on the pilot‚Äôs chest. The smiling bear sat huddled among the crowded wreckage of the man and the blood. A few minutes later, I took my chance. The time was right.  
  
¬† I walked in, loosened his soul, and carried it gently away.  
  
¬† All that was left was the body, the dwindling smell of smoke, and the smiling teddy bear.  
  
¬† As the crowd arrived in full, things, of course, had changed. The horizon was beginning to charcoal. What was left of the blackness above was nothing now but a scribble, and disappearing fast.  
  
¬† The man, in comparison, was the color of bone. Skeleton-colored skin. A ruffled uniform. His eyes were cold and brown‚Äîlike coffee stains‚Äîand the last scrawl from above formed what, to me, appeared an odd, yet familiar, shape. A signature.  
  
¬† The crowd did what crowds do.  
  
¬† As I made my way through, each person stood and played with the quietness of it. It was a small concoction of disjointed hand movements, muffled sentences, and mute, self-conscious turns.  
  
¬† When I glanced back at the plane, the pilot‚Äôs open mouth appeared to be smiling.  
  
¬† A final dirty joke.  
  
¬† Another human punch line.  
  
¬† He remained shrouded in his uniform as the graying light arm-wrestled the sky. As with many of the others, when I began my journey away, there seemed a quick shadow again, a final moment of eclipse‚Äîthe recognition of another soul gone.  
  
¬† You see, to me, for just a moment, despite all of the colors that touch and grapple with what I see in this world, I will often catch an eclipse when a human dies.  
  
¬† I‚Äôve seen millions of them.  
  
¬† I‚Äôve seen more eclipses than I care to remember.  
  
¬† THE FLAG  
  
¬† The last time I saw her was red. The sky was like soup, boiling and stirring. In some places, it was burned. There were black crumbs, and pepper, streaked across the redness.  
  
¬† Earlier, kids had been playing hopscotch there, on the street that looked like oil-stained pages. When I arrived, I could still hear the echoes. The feet tapping the road. The children-voices laughing, and the smiles like salt, but decaying fast.  
  
¬† Then, bombs.  
  
¬† This time, everything was too late.  
  
¬† The sirens. The cuckoo shrieks in the radio. All too late.  
  
¬† Within minutes, mounds of concrete and earth were stacked and piled. The streets were ruptured veins. Blood streamed till it was dried on the road, and the bodies were stuck there, like driftwood after the flood.  
  
¬† They were glued down, every last one of them. A packet of souls.  
  
¬† Was it fate?  
  
¬† Misfortune?  
  
¬† Is that what glued them down like that?  
  
¬† Of course not.  
  
¬† Let‚Äôs not be stupid.  
  
¬† It probably had more to do with the hurled bombs, thrown down by humans hiding in the clouds.  
  
¬† Yes, the sky was now a devastating, home-cooked red. The small German town had been flung apart one more time. Snowflakes of ash fell so lovelily you were tempted to stretch out your tongue to catch them, taste them. Only, they would have scorched your lips. They would have cooked your mouth.  
  
¬† Clearly, I see it.  
  
¬† I was just about to leave when I found her kneeling there.  
  
¬† A mountain range of rubble was written, designed, erected around her. She was clutching at a book.  
  
¬† Apart from everything else, the book thief wanted desperately to go back to the basement, to write, or to read through her story one last time. In hindsight, I see it so obviously on her face. She was dying for it‚Äîthe safety of it, the home of it‚Äîbut she could not move. Also, the basement didn‚Äôt even exist anymore. It was part of the mangled landscape.  
  
¬† Please, again, I ask you to believe me.  
  
¬† I wanted to stop. To crouch down.  
  
¬† I wanted to say:  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, child.‚Äù  
  
¬† But that is not allowed.  
  
¬† I did not crouch down. I did not speak.  
  
¬† Instead, I watched her awhile. When she was able to move, I followed her.  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† She dropped the book.  
  
¬† She knelt.  
  
¬† The book thief howled.  
  
¬† Her book was stepped on several times as the cleanup began, and although orders were given only to clear the mess of concrete, the girl‚Äôs most precious item was thrown aboard a garbage truck, at which point I was compelled. I climbed aboard and took it in my hand, not realizing that I would keep it and view it several thousand times over the years. I would watch the places where we intersect, and marvel at what the girl saw and how she survived. That is the best I can do‚Äîwatch it fall into line with everything else I spectated during that time.  
  
¬† When I recollect her, I see a long list of colors, but it‚Äôs the three in which I saw her in the flesh that resonate the most. Sometimes I manage to float far above those three moments. I hang suspended, until a septic truth bleeds toward clarity.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs when I see them formulate.  
  
¬† THE COLORS  
  
¬† RED: WHITE: BLACK:  
  
¬† They fall on top of each other. The scribbled signature black, onto the blinding global white, onto the thick soupy red.  
  
¬† Yes, often, I am reminded of her, and in one of my vast array of pockets, I have kept her story to retell. It is one of the small legion I carry, each one extraordinary in its own right. Each one an attempt‚Äîan immense leap of an attempt‚Äîto prove to me that you, and your human existence, are worth it.  
  
¬† Here it is. One of a handful.  
  
¬† The Book Thief.  
  
¬† If you feel like it, come with me. I will tell you a story.  
  
¬† I‚Äôll show you something.  
  
¬† PART ONE

¬† That last time.  
  
¬† That red sky ‚Ä¶  
  
¬† How does a book thief end up kneeling and howling and flanked by a man-made heap of ridiculous, greasy, cooked-up rubble?  
  
¬† Years earlier, the start was snow.  
  
¬† The time had come. For one.  
  
¬† A SPECTACULARLY TRAGIC MOMENT  
  
¬† A train was moving quickly.  
  
¬† It was packed with humans.  
  
¬† A six-year-old boy died in the third carriage.  
  
¬† The book thief and her brother were traveling down toward Munich, where they would soon be given over to foster parents. We now know, of course, that the boy didn‚Äôt make it.  
  
¬† HOW IT HAPPENED  
  
¬† There was an intense spurt of coughing.  
  
¬† Almost an inspired spurt.  
  
¬† And soon after‚Äînothing.  
  
¬† When the coughing stopped, there was nothing but the nothingness of life moving on with a shuffle, or a near-silent twitch. A suddenness found its way onto his lips then, which were a corroded brown color and peeling, like old paint. In desperate need of redoing.  
  
¬† Their mother was asleep.  
  
¬† I entered the train.  
  
¬† My feet stepped through the cluttered aisle and my palm was over his mouth in an instant. No one noticed. The train galloped on. Except the girl.  
  
¬† With one eye open, one still in a dream, the book thief‚Äîalso known as Liesel Meminger‚Äîcould see without question that her younger brother, Werner, was now sideways and dead.  
  
¬† His blue eyes stared at the floor.  
  
¬† Seeing nothing.  
  
¬† Prior to waking up,  
the book thief was dreaming about the F√ºhrer, Adolf Hitler. In the dream, she was attending a rally at which he spoke, looking at the skull-colored part in his hair and the perfect square of his mustache. She was listening contentedly to the torrent of words spilling from his mouth. His sentences glowed in the light. In a quieter moment, he actually crouched down and smiled at her. She returned the smile and said, ‚ÄúGuten Tag, Herr F√ºhrer. Wie geht‚Äôs dir heut?‚Äù She hadn‚Äôt learned to speak too well, or even to read, as she had rarely frequented school. The reason for that she would find out in due course.  
  
¬† Just as the F√ºhrer was about to reply, she woke up.  
  
¬† It was January 1939. She was nine years old, soon to be ten.  
  
¬† Her brother was dead.  
  
¬† One eye open.  
  
¬† One still in a dream.  
  
¬† It would be better for a complete dream, I think, but I really have no control over that.  
  
¬† The second eye jumped awake and she caught me out, no doubt about it. It was exactly when I knelt down and extracted his soul, holding it limply in my swollen arms. He warmed up soon after, but when I picked him up originally, the boy‚Äôs spirit was soft and cold, like ice cream. He started melting in my arms. Then warming up completely. Healing.  
  
¬† For Liesel Meminger, there was the imprisoned stiffness of movement and the staggered onslaught of thoughts. Es stimmt nicht. This isn‚Äôt happening. This isn‚Äôt happening.  
  
¬† And the shaking.  
  
¬† Why do they always shake them?  
  
¬† Yes, I know, I know, I assume it has something to do with instinct. To stem the flow of truth. Her heart at that point was slippery and hot, and loud, so loud so loud.  
  
¬† Stupidly, I stayed. I watched.  
  
¬† Next, her mother.  
  
¬† She woke her up with the same distraught shake.  
  
¬† If you can‚Äôt imagine it, think clumsy silence. Think bits and pieces of floating despair. And drowning in a train.  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† Snow had been falling consistently, and the service to Munich was forced to stop due to faulty track work. There was a woman wailing. A girl stood numbly next to her. In panic, the mother opened the door.  
  
¬† She climbed down into the snow, holding the small body.  
  
¬† What could the girl do but follow?  
  
¬† As you‚Äôve been informed, two guards also exited the train. They discussed and argued over what to do. The situation was unsavory to say the least. It was eventually decided that all three of them should be taken to the next township and left there to sort things out.  
  
¬† This time, the train limped through the snowed-in country.  
  
¬† It hobbled in and stopped.  
  
¬† They stepped onto the platform, the body in her mother‚Äôs arms.  
  
¬† They stood.  
  
¬† The boy was getting heavy.  
  
¬† Liesel had no idea where she was. All was white, and as they remained at the station, she could only stare at the faded lettering of the sign in front of her. For Liesel, the town was nameless, and it was there that her brother, Werner, was buried two days later. Witnesses included a priest and two shivering grave diggers.  
  
¬† AN OBSERVATION  
  
¬† A pair of train guards.  
  
¬† A pair of grave diggers.  
  
¬† When it came down to it, one of them called the shots.  
  
¬† The other did what he was told.  
  
¬† The question is, what if the other is a lot more than one?  
  
¬† Mistakes, mistakes, it‚Äôs all I seem capable of at times.  
  
¬† For two days, I went about my business. I traveled the globe as always, handing souls to the conveyor belt of eternity. I watched them trundle passively on. Several times, I warned myself that I should keep a good distance from the burial of Liesel Meminger‚Äôs brother. I did not heed my advice.  
  
¬† From miles away, as I approached, I could already see the small group of humans standing frigidly among the wasteland of snow. The cemetery welcomed me like a friend, and soon, I was with them. I bowed my head.  
  
¬† Standing to Liesel‚Äôs left, the grave diggers were rubbing their hands together and whining about the snow and the current digging conditions. ‚ÄúSo hard getting through all the ice,‚Äù and so forth. One of them couldn‚Äôt have been more than fourteen. An apprentice. When he walked away, after a few dozen paces, a black book fell innocuously from his coat pocket without his knowledge.  
  
¬† A few minutes later, Liesel‚Äôs mother started leaving with the priest. She was thanking him for his performance of the ceremony.  
  
¬† The girl, however, stayed.  
  
¬† Her knees entered the ground. Her moment had arrived.  
  
¬† Still in disbelief, she started to dig. He couldn‚Äôt be dead. He couldn‚Äôt be dead. He couldn‚Äôt‚Äî  
  
¬† Within seconds, snow was carved into her skin.  
  
¬† Frozen blood was cracked across her hands.  
  
¬† Somewhere in all the snow, she could see her broken heart, in two pieces. Each half was glowing, and beating under all that white. She realized her mother had come back for her only when she felt the boniness of a hand on her shoulder. She was being dragged away. A warm scream filled her throat.  
  
¬† A SMALL IMAGE, PERHAPS  
  
¬† TWENTY METERS AWAY  
  
¬† When the dragging was done, the mother and the girl stood and breathed.  
  
¬† There was something black and rectangular lodged in the snow.  
  
¬† Only the girl saw it.  
  
¬† She bent down and picked it up and held it firmly in her fingers.  
  
¬† The book had silver writing on it.  
  
¬† They held hands.  
  
¬† A final, soaking farewell was let go of, and they turned and left the cemetery, looking back several times.  
  
¬† As for me, I remained a few moments longer.  
  
¬† I waved.  
  
¬† No one waved back.  
  
¬† Mother and daughter vacated the cemetery and made their way toward the next train to Munich.  
  
¬† Both were skinny and pale.  
  
¬† Both had sores on their lips.  
  
¬† Liesel noticed it in the dirty, fogged-up window of the train when they boarded just before midday. In the written words of the book thief herself, the journey continued like everything had happened.  
  
¬† When the train pulled into the Bahnhof in Munich, the passengers slid out as if from a torn package. There were people of every stature, but among them, the poor were the most easily recognized. The impoverished always try to keep moving, as if relocating might help. They ignore the reality that a new version of the same old problem will be waiting at the end of the trip‚Äîthe relative you cringe to kiss.  
  
¬† I think her mother knew this quite well. She wasn‚Äôt delivering her children to the higher echelons of Munich, but a foster home had apparently been found, and if nothing else, the new family could at least feed the girl and the boy a little better, and educate them properly.  
  
¬† The boy.  
  
¬† Liesel was sure her mother carried the memory of him, slung over her shoulder. She dropped him. She saw his feet and legs and body slap the platform.  
  
¬† How could that woman walk?  
  
¬† How could she move?  
  
¬† That‚Äôs the sort of thing I‚Äôll never know, or comprehend‚Äîwhat humans are capable of.  
  
¬† She picked him up and continued walking, the girl clinging now to her side.  
  
¬† Authorities were met and questions of lateness and the boy raised their vulnerable heads. Liesel remained in the corner of the small, dusty office as her mother sat with clenched thoughts on a very hard chair.  
  
¬† There was the chaos of goodbye.  
  
¬† It was a goodbye that was wet, with the girl‚Äôs head buried into the woolly, worn shallows of her mother‚Äôs coat. There had been some more dragging.  
  
¬† Quite a way beyond the outskirts of Munich, there was a town called Molching, said best by the likes of you and me as ‚ÄúMolking.‚Äù That‚Äôs where they were taking her, to a street by the name of Himmel.  
  
¬† A TRANSLATION  
  
¬† Himmel = Heaven  
  
¬† Whoever named Himmel Street certainly had a healthy sense of irony. Not that it was a living hell. It wasn‚Äôt. But it sure as hell wasn‚Äôt heaven, either.  
  
¬† Regardless, Liesel‚Äôs foster parents were waiting.  
  
¬† The Hubermanns.  
  
¬† They‚Äôd been expecting a girl and a boy and would be paid a small allowance for having them. Nobody wanted to be the one to tell Rosa Hubermann that the boy didn‚Äôt survive the trip. In fact, no one ever really wanted to tell her anything. As far as dispositions go, hers wasn‚Äôt really enviable, although she had a good record with foster kids in the past. Apparently, she‚Äôd straightened a few out.  
  
¬† For Liesel, it was a ride in a car.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd never been in one before.  
  
¬† There was the constant rise and fall of her stomach, and the futile hopes that they‚Äôd lose their way or change their minds. Among it all, her thoughts couldn‚Äôt help turning toward her mother, back at the Bahnhof, waiting to leave again. Shivering. Bundled up in that useless coat. She‚Äôd be eating her nails, waiting for the train. The platform would be long and uncomfortable‚Äîa slice of cold cement. Would she keep an eye out for the approximate burial site of her son on the return trip? Or would sleep be too heavy?  
  
¬† The car moved on, with Liesel dreading the last, lethal turn.  
  
¬† The day was gray, the color of Europe.  
  
¬† Curtains of rain were drawn around the car.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNearly there.‚Äù The foster care lady, Frau Heinrich, turned around and smiled. ‚ÄúDein neues Heim. Your new home.‚Äù  
  
¬† Liesel made a clear circle on the dribbled glass and looked out.  
  
¬† A PHOTO OF HIMMEL STREET  
  
¬† The buildings appear to be glued together, mostly small houses and apartment blocks that look nervous.  
  
¬† There is murky snow spread out like carpet.  
  
¬† There is concrete, empty hat-stand trees, and gray air.  
  
¬† A man was also in the car. He remained with the girl while Frau Heinrich disappeared inside. He never spoke. Liesel assumed he was there to make sure she wouldn‚Äôt run away or to force her inside if she gave them any trouble. Later, however, when the trouble did start, he simply sat there and watched. Perhaps he was only the last resort, the final solution.  
  
¬† After a few minutes, a very tall man came out. Hans Hubermann, Liesel‚Äôs foster father. On one side of him was th  
e medium-height Frau Heinrich. On the other was the squat shape of Rosa Hubermann, who looked like a small wardrobe with a coat thrown over it. There was a distinct waddle to her walk. Almost cute, if it wasn‚Äôt for her face, which was like creased-up cardboard and annoyed, as if she was merely tolerating all of it. Her husband walked straight, with a cigarette smoldering between his fingers. He rolled his own.  
  
¬† ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢  
  
¬† The fact was this:  
  
¬† Liesel would not get out of the car.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWas ist los mit dem Kind?‚Äù Rosa Hubermann inquired. She said it again. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with this child?‚Äù She stuck her face inside the car and said, ‚ÄúNa, komm. Komm.‚Äù  
  
¬† The seat in front was flung forward. A corridor of cold light invited her out. She would not move.  
  
¬† Outside, through the circle she‚Äôd made, Liesel could see the tall man‚Äôs fingers, still holding the cigarette. Ash stumbled from its edge and lunged and lifted several times until it hit the ground. It took nearly fifteen minutes to coax her from the car. It was the tall man who did it.  
  
¬† Quietly.  
  
¬† There was the gate next, which she clung to.  
  
¬† A gang of tears trudged from her eyes as she held on and refused to go inside. People started to gather on the street until Rosa Hubermann swore at them, after which they reversed back, whence they came.  
  
¬† A TRANSLATION OF  
  
¬† ROSA HUBERMANN‚ÄôS ANNOUNCEMENT  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you assholes looking at?‚Äù  
  
¬† Eventually, Liesel Meminger walked gingerly inside. Hans Hubermann had her by one hand. Her small suitcase had her by the other. Buried beneath the folded layer of clothes in that suitcase was a small black book, which, for all we know, a fourteen-year-old grave digger in a nameless town had probably spent the last few hours looking for. ‚ÄúI promise you,‚Äù I imagine him saying to his boss, ‚ÄúI have no idea what happened to it. I‚Äôve looked everywhere. Everywhere!‚Äù I‚Äôm sure he would never have suspected the girl, and yet, there it was‚Äîa black book with silver words written against the ceiling of her clothes:  
  
¬† THE GRAVE DIGGER‚ÄôS HANDBOOK  
  
¬† A Twelve-Step Guide to  
  
¬† Grave-Digging Success  
  
¬† Published by the Bayern Cemetery Association  
  
¬† The book thief had struck for the first time‚Äîthe beginning of an illustrious career.  
  
¬† GROWING UP A SAUMENSCH  
  
¬† Yes, an illustrious career.  
  
¬† I should hasten to admit, however, that there was a considerable hiatus between the first stolen book and the second. Another noteworthy point is that the first was stolen from snow and the second from fire. Not to omit that others were also given to her. All told, she owned fourteen books, but she saw her story as being made up predominantly of ten of them. Of those ten, six were stolen, one showed up at the kitchen table, two were made for her by a hidden Jew, and one was delivered by a soft, yellow-dressed afternoon.  
  
¬† When she came to write her story, she would wonder exactly when the books and the words started to mean not just something, but everything. Was it when she first set eyes on the room with shelves and shelves of them? Or when Max Vandenburg arrived on Himmel Street carrying handfuls of suffering and Hitler‚Äôs Mein Kampf? Was it reading in the shelters? The last parade to Dachau? Was it The Word Shaker? Perhaps there would never be a precise answer as to when and where it occurred. In any case, that‚Äôs getting ahead of myself. Before we make it to any of that, we first need to tour Liesel Meminger‚Äôs beginnings on Himmel Street and the art of saumensching:  
  
¬† Upon her arrival, you could still see the bite marks of snow on her hands and the frosty blood on her fingers. Everything about her was undernourished. Wirelike shins. Coat hanger arms. She did not produce it easily, but when it came, she had a starving smile.  
  
¬† Her hair was a close enough brand of German blond, but she had dangerous eyes. Dark brown. You didn‚Äôt really want brown eyes in Germany around that time. Perhaps she received them from her father, but she had no way of knowing, as she couldn‚Äôt remember him. There was really only one thing she knew about her father. It was a label she did not understand.  
  
¬† A STRANGE WORD  
  
¬† Kommunist  
  
¬† She‚Äôd heard it several times in the past few years.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCommunist.‚Äù  
  
¬† There were boardinghouses crammed with people, rooms filled with questions. And that word. That strange word was always there somewhere, standing in the corner, watching from the dark. It wore suits, uniforms. No matter where they went, there it was, each time her father was mentioned. She could smell it and taste it. She just couldn‚Äôt spell or understand it. When she asked her mother what it meant, she was told that it wasn‚Äôt important, that she shouldn‚Äôt worry about such things. At one boardinghouse, there was a healthier woman who tried to teach the children to write, using charcoal on the wall. Liesel was tempted to ask her the meaning, but it never eventuated. One day, that woman was taken away for questioning. She didn‚Äôt come back.  
  
¬† When Liesel arrived in Molching, she had at least some inkling that she was being saved, but that was not a comfort. If her mother loved her, why leave her on someone else‚Äôs doorstep? Why? Why?  
  
¬† Why?  
  
¬† The fact that she knew the answer‚Äîif only at the most basic level‚Äîseemed beside the point. Her mother was constantly sick and there was never any money to fix her. Liesel knew that. But that didn‚Äôt mean she had to accept it. No matter how many times she was told that she was loved, there was no recognition that the proof was in the abandonment. Nothing changed the fact that she was a lost, skinny child in another foreign place, with more foreign people. Alone.  
  
¬† The Hubermanns lived in one of the small, boxlike houses on Himmel Street. A few rooms, a kitchen, and a shared outhouse with neighbors. The roof was flat and there was a shallow basement for storage. It was supposedly not a basement of adequate depth. In 1939, this wasn‚Äôt a problem. Later, in ‚Ä≤42 and ‚Ä≤43, it was. When air raids started, they always needed to rush down the street to a better shelter.  
  
¬† In the beginning, it was the profanity that made an immediate impact. It was so vehement and prolific. Every second word was either Saumensch or Saukerl or Arschloch. For people who aren‚Äôt familiar with these words, I should explain. Sau, of course, refers to pigs. In the case of Saumensch, it serves to castigate, berate, or plain humiliate a female. Saukerl (pronounced ‚Äúsaukairl‚Äù) is for a male. Arschloch can be translated directly into ‚Äúasshole.‚Äù That word, however, does not differentiate between the sexes. It simply is.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSaumensch, du dreckiges!‚Äù Liesel‚Äôs foster mother shouted that first evening when she refused to have a bath. ‚ÄúYou filthy pig! Why won‚Äôt you get undressed?‚Äù She was good at being furious. In fact, you could say that Rosa Hubermann had a face decorated with constant fury. That was how the creases were made in the cardboard texture of her complexion.  
  
¬† Liesel, naturally, was bathed in anxiety. There was no way she was getting into any bath, or into bed for that matter. She was twisted into one corner of the closetlike washroom, clutching for the nonexistent arms of the wall for some level of support. There was nothing but dry paint, difficult breath, and the deluge of abuse from Rosa.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLeave her alone.‚Äù Hans Hubermann entered the fray. His gentle voice made its way in, as if slipping through a crowd. ‚ÄúLeave her to me.‚Äù  
  
¬† He moved closer and sat on the floor, against the wall. The tiles were cold and unkind.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou know how to roll a cigarette?‚Äù he asked her, and for the next hour or so, they sat in the rising pool of darkness, playing with the tobacco and the cigarette papers and Hans Hubermann smoking them.  
  
¬† When the hour was up, Liesel could roll a cigarette moderately well. She still didn‚Äôt have a bath.  
  
¬† SOME FACTS ABOUT  
  
¬† HANS HUBERMANN  
  
¬† He loved to smoke.  
  
¬† The main thing he enjoyed about smoking was the rolling.  
  
¬† He was a painter by trade and played the piano accordion. This came in handy, especially in winter, when he could make a little money playing in the pubs of Molching, like the Knoller.  
  
¬† He had already cheat  
ed me in one world war but would later be put into another (as a perverse kind of reward), where he would somehow manage to avoid me again.  
  
¬† To most people, Hans Hubermann was barely visible. An un-special person. Certainly, his painting skills were excellent. His musical ability was better than average. Somehow, though, and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve met people like this, he was able to appear as merely part of the background, even if he was standing at the front of a line. He was always just there. Not noticeable. Not important or particularly valuable.  
  
¬† The frustration of that appearance, as you can imagine, was its complete misleadence, let‚Äôs say. There most definitely was value in him, and it did not go unnoticed by Liesel Meminger. (The human child‚Äîso much cannier at times than the stupefyingly ponderous adult.) She saw it immediately.  
  
¬† His manner.  
  
¬† The quiet air around him.  
  
¬† When he turned the light on in the small, callous washroom that night, Liesel observed the strangeness of her foster father‚Äôs eyes. They were made of kindness, and silver. Like soft silver, melting. Liesel, upon seeing those eyes, understood that Hans Hubermann was worth a lot.  
  
¬† SOME FACTS ABOUT  
  
¬† ROSA HUBERMANN  
  
¬† She was five feet, one inch tall and wore her browny gray strands of elastic hair in a bun.  
  
¬† To supplement the Hubermann income, she did the washing and ironing for five of the wealthier households in Molching.  
  
¬† Her cooking was atrocious.  
  
¬† She possessed the unique ability to aggravate almost anyone she ever met.  
  
¬† But she did love Liesel Meminger.  
  
¬† Her way of showing it just happened to be strange.  
  
¬† It involved bashing her with wooden spoon and words at various intervals.  
  
¬† When Liesel finally had a bath, after two weeks of living on Himmel Street, Rosa gave her an enormous, injury-inducing hug. Nearly choking her, she said, ‚ÄúSaumensch, du dreckiges‚Äîit‚Äôs about time!‚Äù  
  
¬† After a few months, they were no longer Mr. and Mrs. Hubermann. With a typical fistful of words, Rosa said, ‚ÄúNow listen, Liesel‚Äîfrom now on you call me Mama.‚Äù She thought a moment. ‚ÄúWhat did you call your real mother?",1,1749321624.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I am a treeplanter from Quebec working in BC.
For those who don't know, planting is piece rate work. I personally make arohnd 350-450 a day, 3-1 shift rotations.

We were heading to work and got in a truck rollover, ended up in a lake, everyone got out before in sank in, the driver almost didnt make it out, got fully submerged. I cant explain the silence that was around until he popped his head out the water.

I got a concussion from the accident, hospital visit. This happened june 5th. My phone and sim card are at the bottom of the lake, I was brought back to camp. We have starlink but no service.

Ive just been sleeping in my tent. Waking up periodically and then back sleep.
I made a claim with worksafeBC but i cannot call, so I dont know how that will be handeled.

I also feel like I should go home and rest in a bed instead of on my broken air matress in the woods.
Treeplanting is hard physical work, so I dont know how i feel about waiting 1-2 shifts and then pushing a concussion, however i make my yearly money with this job, and then usually get on EI for the rest of the year, while I go to school parttime and apply to jobs elsewhere where I live.

Last year i tried getting a stable job (at a coffee shop or something) for 6 months, and I seem to be unhirable.

I am worried about my finances but also about if I will feel nimble again soon. I hate that I currently walk around like an old man and get headaces all the time.

My questions now are:

1) i should be covered, but what is the amount and for how long? Since i have worked less then 12 weeks here (only 1 month) i have no idea how the amount woild be calculated.

2) can I go home? I want to be in a bed. But am I still covered if I leave? Since I live out of BC?

3) do I have to pay for my flight?

4) is there a way to get a new phone covered by someone?

HE GRIPPED THE STEERING WHEEL LOOSELY AS THE CAR, ITS lights out, drifted slowly to a stop. A few last scraps of gravel kicked out of the tire treads and then silence enveloped him. He took a moment to adjust to the surroundings and then pulled out a pair of worn but still effective night-vision binoculars. The house slowly came into focus. He shifted easily, confidently in his seat. A duffel bag lay on the front seat beside him. The car‚Äôs interior was faded but clean. The car was also stolen. And from a very unlikely source.  A pair of miniature palm trees hung from the rearview mirror. He smiled grimly as he looked at them. Soon he might be going to the land of palms. Quiet, blue, see-through water, powdery salmon-colored sunsets and late mornings. He had to get out. It was time. For all the occasions he had said that to himself, this time he felt sure. Sixty-six years old, Luther Whitney was eligible to collect Social Security, and was a card-carrying member of AARP. At that age most men had settled down into second careers as grandfathers, part-time raisers of their children‚Äôs children, when weary joints were eased down into familiar recliners and arteries finished closing up with the clutter of a lifetime. Luther had had only one career his entire life. It involved breaking and entering into other people‚Äôs homes and places of business, usually in the nighttime, as now, and taking away as much of their property as he could feasibly carry. Though clearly on the wrong side of the law, Luther had never fired a gun or hurled a knife in anger or fear, except for his part in a largely confusing war fought where South and North Korea were joined at the hip. And the only punches he had ever thrown were in bars, and those only in self-defense as the suds made men braver than they should have been. Luther only had one criterion in choosing his targets: he took only from those who could well afford to lose it. He considered himself no different from the armies of people who routinely coddled the wealthy, constantly persuading them to buy things they did not need. A good many of his sixty-odd years had been spent in assorted medium- and then maximum-security correctional facilities along the East Coast. Like blocks of granite around his neck, three prior felony convictions stood to his credit in three different states. Years had been carved out of his life. Important years. But he could do nothing to change that now.¬† He had refined his skills to where he had high hopes that a fourth conviction would never materialize. There was absolutely nothing mysterious about the ramifications of another bust: he would be looking at the full twenty years. And at his age, twenty years was a death penalty. They might as well fry him, which was the way the Commonwealth of Virginia used to handle its particularly bad people. The citizens of this vastly historic state were by and large a God-fearing people, and religion premised upon the notion of equal retribution consistently demanded the ultimate payback. The commonwealth succeeded in disposing of more death row criminals than all but two states, and the leaders, Texas and Florida, shared the moral sentiments of their Southern sister. But not for simple burglary; even the good Virginians had their limits.  
  
¬† Yet with all that at risk he couldn‚Äôt take his eyes off the home‚Äîmansion, of course, one would be compelled to call it. It had engrossed him for several months now. Tonight that fascination would end.  
  
¬† Middleton, Virginia. A forty-five-minute drive west on a slingshot path from Washington, D.C. Home to vast estates, obligatory Jaguars, and horses whose price tags could feed the residents of an entire inner-city apartment building for a year. Homes in this area sprawled across enough earth with enough splendor to qualify for their own appellation. The irony of his target‚Äôs name, the Coppers, was not lost upon him.  
  
¬† The adrenaline rush that accompanied each job was absolutely unique. He imagined it was somewhat like how the batter felt as he nonchalantly trotted the bases, taking all the time in the world, after newly bruised leather had landed somewhere in the street. The crowd on its feet, fifty thousand pairs of eyes on one human being, all the air in the world seemingly sucked into one space, and then suddenly displaced by the arc of one man‚Äôs glorious swing of the wood.  
  
¬† Luther took a long sweep of the area with his still sharp eyes. An occasional firefly winked back at him. Otherwise he was alone. He listened for a moment to the rise and fall of the cicadas and then that chorus faded into the background, so omnipresent was it to every person who had lived long in the area.  
  
¬† He pulled the car further down the blacktop road and backed onto a short dirt road that ended in a mass of thick trees. His iron-gray hair was covered with a black ski hat. His leathery face was smeared black with camouflage cream; calm, green eyes hovered above a cinder block jaw. The flesh carried on his spare frame was as tight as ever. He looked like the Army Ranger he had once been. Luther got out of the car.  
  
¬† Crouching behind a tree, Luther surveyed his target. The Coppers, like many country estates that were not true working farms or stables, had a huge and ornate wrought iron gate set on twin brick columns but had no fencing. The grounds were accessible directly from the road or the nearby woods. Luther entered from the woods.  
  
¬† It took Luther two minutes to reach the edge of the cornfield adjacent to the house. The owner obviously had no need for home-grown vegetables but had apparently taken the country squire role to heart. Luther wasn‚Äôt complaining, since it afforded him a hidden path almost to the front door.  
  
¬† He waited a few moments and then disappeared into the embracing thickness of the corn stalks.  
  
¬† The ground was mostly clear of debris and his tennis shoes made no sound, which was important, for any noise carried easily here. He kept his eyes straight ahead; his feet, after much practice, carefully picked their way through the slender rows, compensating for the slight unevenness of the ground. The night air was cool after the debilitating heat of another stagnant summer, but not nearly cool enough for breath to be transformed into the tiny clouds that could be seen from a distance by restless or insomniac eyes.  
  
¬† Luther had timed this operation several times over the past month, always stopping at the edge of the field before stepping into the front grounds and past no-man‚Äôs-land. In his head, every detail had been worked and reworked hundreds of times until a precise script of movement, waiting, followed by more movement was firmly entrenched in his mind.  
  
¬† He crouched down at the edge of the front grounds and took one more long look around; no need to rush. No dogs to worry about, which was good. A human, no matter how young and fleet, simply could not outrun a dog. But it was the noise they made that stopped men like Luther cold. There was also no perimeter security system, probably because of the innumerable false alarms that would be caused by the large populations of deer, squirrel and raccoon roaming over the area. However, Luther would shortly be faced with a highly sophisticated defense package that he would have thirty-three seconds to disarm‚Äîand that included the ten seconds it would take him to remove the control panel.  
  
¬† The private security patrol had passed through the area thirty minutes earlier. The cop clones were supposed to vary their routines, making sweeps through their surveillance sectors every hour. But after a month of observations, Luther had easily discerned a pattern. He had at least three hours before another pass would be made. He wouldn‚Äôt need nearly that long.  
  
¬† The grounds were pitch black, and thick shrubs, the lifeblood of the burglary class, clung to the brick entryway like a caterpillar nest to a tree branch. He checked each window of the house: all black, all silent. He had watched the caravan carrying the home‚Äôs occupants parade out two days ago to points south, and carefully took inventory of all owners and personnel. The nearest estate was a good two miles away.  
  
¬† He took a deep breath. He had planned everything out, but in this business, the simple fa  
ct was that you could never account for everything.  
  
¬† He loosened the grips on his backpack and then glided out from the field in long, smooth strides across the lawn, and in ten seconds was facing the thick, solid-wood front door with reinforced steel framing together with a locking system that was rated at the top of the charts for holding force. None of which concerned Luther in the least.  
  
¬† He slipped a facsimile front-door key out of his jacket pocket and inserted it into the keyhole without, however, turning it.  
  
¬† He listened for another few seconds. Then he slipped off his backpack and changed his shoes so there would be no traces of mud. He readied his battery-operated screwdriver, which could reveal the circuitry he needed to fool ten times faster than he could by hand.  
  
¬† The next piece of equipment he carefully pulled from his backpack weighed exactly six ounces, was slightly bigger than a pocket calculator and other than his daughter was the best investment he had ever made in his life. Nicknamed ‚ÄúWit‚Äù by its owner, the tiny device had assisted Luther in his last three jobs without a hitch.  
  
¬† The five digits comprising this home‚Äôs security code had already been supplied to Luther and programmed into his computer. Their proper sequence was still a mystery to him, but that obstacle would have to be eradicated by his tiny metal, wire and microchip companion if he wanted to avoid the ear-piercing shriek that would instantly emit from the four sound cannons planted at each corner of the ten-thousand-square-foot fortress he was invading. Then would follow the police call dialed by the nameless computer he would battle in a few moments. The home also had pressure-sensitive windows and floor plates, in addition to tamperproof door magnets. All of which would mean nothing if Wit could tear the correct code sequence from the alarm system‚Äôs grasp.  
  
¬† He eyed the key in the door and with a practiced motion hooked Wit to his harness belt so that it hung easily against his side. The key turned effortlessly in the lock and Luther prepared to block out the next sound that he would hear, the low beep of the security system that warned of impending doom for the intruder if the correct answer was not fed into it in the allotted time and not a millisecond later.  
  
¬† He replaced his black leather gloves with a pair of more nimble plastic ones that had a second layer of padding on the fingertips and palms. It was not his practice to leave any evidence behind. Luther took one deep breath, then opened the portal. The shrill beep of the security system met him instantly. He quickly moved into the enormous foyer and confronted the alarm panel.  
  
¬† The automatic screwdriver whirled noiselessly; the six metal pieces dropped into Luther‚Äôs hands and then were deposited in a carrier on his belt. Slender wires attached to Wit flashed against the sliver of moonlight seeping through the window beside the door, and then Luther, probing momentarily like a surgeon through a patient‚Äôs chest cavity, found the correct spot, clipped the strands into place and then flipped on the power source to his companion.  
  
¬† From across the foyer, a slash of crimson stared down at him. The infrared detector had already locked on Luther‚Äôs thermal offset. As the seconds ticked down, it patiently waited for the security system‚Äôs ‚Äúbrain‚Äù to pronounce the intruder friend or foe.  
  
¬† Faster than the eye could follow, the numbers flashed across Wit‚Äôs digital screen in neon amber; the allotted time blinked down in a small box at the top-right-hand corner of the same screen.  
  
¬† Five seconds elapsed and then the numbers 5, 13, 9, 3 and 11 appeared on Wit‚Äôs tiny glass face and locked.  
  
¬† The beep stopped on cue as the security system was disarmed, the red light flashed off and was replaced with the friendly green, and Luther was in business. He removed the wires, screwed the plate back on and repacked his equipment, then carefully locked the front door.  
  
¬† The master bedroom was on the third floor, which could be reached by an elevator down the main first-floor hallway to the right, but Luther chose the stairs instead. The less dependent he was on anything he did not have complete control over the better. Getting stuck in an elevator for several weeks was not part of his battle plan.  
  
¬† He looked at the detector in the corner of the ceiling as its rectangular mouth smiled at him, its surveillance arc asleep for now. Then he headed up the staircase.  
  
¬† The master bedroom door was not locked. In a few seconds he had his low-power, nonglare work lamp set up and took a moment to look around. The green glow from a second control panel mounted next to the bedroom door broke the darkness.  
  
¬† The house itself had been built within the last five years; Luther had checked the records at the courthouse and had even managed to gain access to a set of blueprints of the place from the planning commissioner‚Äôs office, it being large enough to require special blessing from the local government as though they would ever actually deny the rich their wishes.  
  
¬† There were no surprises in the building plans. It was a big, solid house more than worth the multimiilion-dollar price tag that had been paid in cash by its owner.  
  
¬† Indeed, Luther had visited this home once before, in broad daylight, with people everywhere. He had been in this very room and he had seen what he needed to see. And that was why he was here tonight.  
  
¬† Six-inch crown molding peered down at him as he knelt next to the gigantic, canopied bed. Next to the bed was a nightstand. On it were a small silver clock, the newest romance novel of the day and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a thick leather handle.  
  
¬† Everything about the place was big and expensive. There were three walk-in closets in the room, each about the size of Luther‚Äôs living room. Two were occupied by women‚Äôs clothes and shoes and purses and every other female accoutrement one could rationally or irrationally spend money on. Luther glanced at the framed prints on the nightstand and wryly observed the twenty-something ‚Äúlittle woman‚Äù next to the seventy-something husband.  
  
¬† There were many types of lotteries in the world and not all of them state-run.  
  
¬† Several of the photos showed off the lady of the house‚Äôs proportions to almost maximum degree, and his quick examination of the closet revealed that her dressing pleasures leaned to the downright sleazy.  
  
¬† He looked up at the full-length mirror, studying the ornate carvings around its edges. He next surveyed the sides. It was a heavy, nifty bit of work, built right into the wall, or so it seemed, but Luther knew that hinges were carefully hidden into the slight recess six inches from the top and bottom.  
  
¬† Luther looked back at the mirror. He had the distinct advantage of having seen a target like this full-length model a couple of years ago although he hadn‚Äôt planned to crack it. But you didn‚Äôt ignore a second golden egg just because you had the first in hand, and that second golden egg had been worth about fifty thou‚Äô. The prize on the other side of this private looking glass he figured would be about ten times that.  
  
¬† Using brute force and the aid of a crowbar he could overcome the locking system built into the mirror‚Äôs carvings but that would take precious time. And, more than that, it would leave behind obvious signs of the place having been violated. And although the house was supposed to be empty for the next several weeks, one never knew. When he left the Coppers there would be no obvious evidence he had ever been there. Even upon their return the owners might not check the vault for some time. In any event, he did not have to take the hard route.  
  
¬† He walked quickly over to the large-screen TV located against one wall of the vast chamber. The area was set up as a sitting room with matching chintz-covered chairs and a large coffee table. Luther looked at the three remotes lying there. One to work the TV, one for the VCR and one that would cut his night‚Äôs work by ninety percent. Each had a brand name on it, each looked pretty much like the other, but a quick experiment showed that two worked their appropriate apparatus and one did not.  
  
¬† He walked back across the room, pointed the control at the mirror and pushed the lone red button located at the bottom of the hardware. Ordinarily that action meant the VCR was recording. Tonight, in this room, it meant the bank was opening for business for its one fortunate customer.  
/> ¬† Luther watched the door swing open easily, silently on the now-revealed no-maintenance hinges. From long habit, he replaced the control exactly where it had been, pulled a collapsible duffel bag out of his backpack and entered the vault.  
  
¬† As his light swept through the darkness he was surprised to see an upholstered chair sitting in the middle of the room, which looked to be about six feet by six feet. On the chair‚Äôs arm rested an identical remote, obviously a safeguard against being locked in by accident. Then his eyes took in the shelves down each side.  
  
¬† The cash, bundled neatly, went in first, then the contents of the slender boxes that were definitely not costume jewelry. Luther counted about two hundred thousand dollars‚Äô worth of negotiable bonds and other securities, and two small boxes of antique coins and another of stamps, including one of an inverted figure that made Luther swallow hard. He ignored the blank checks and the boxes full of legal documents, which were worthless to him. His quick assessment ended at almost two million dollars, probably more.  
  
¬† He took one more look around, taking care not to miss any stray nook. The walls were thick‚Äîhe figured they had to be fireproof, or as fireproof as man could make something. The place wasn‚Äôt hermetically sealed; the air was fresh, not stale. Somebody could stay in here for days.  
  
¬† \* \* \*  
  
¬† THE LIMO MOVED QUICKLY DOWN THE ROAD FOLLOWED BY THE van, each driver expert enough to accomplish this feat without the benefit of headlights.  
  
¬† Inside the spacious back seat of the limo were a man and two women, one of whom was close to being drunk and who was doing her best to undress the man and herself right there, despite the gentle defensive efforts of her victim.  
  
¬† The other woman sat across from them tight-lipped, ostensibly trying to ignore the ridiculous spectacle, which included girlish giggling and much panting, but in reality she closely observed every detail of the pair‚Äôs efforts. Her focus was on a large book that sat open in her lap where appointments and notes battled each other for space and the attention of the male sitting across from her, who took the opportunity of his companion wrenching off her spike heels to pour himself another drink. His capacity for alcohol was enormous. He could drink twice the amount he had already consumed tonight and there would be no outward signs, no slurring of speech or impeded motor functions‚Äîwhich would have been deadly for a man in his position.  
  
¬† She had to admire him, his obsessions, his truly raw edges, while at the same time his being able to project an image to the world that cried out purity and strength, normalcy but, at the same time, greatness. Every woman in America was in love with him, enamored with his classic good looks, immense self-assurance and also what he represented, for all of them. And he returned that universal admiration with a passion, however misplaced, that astonished her.  
  
¬† Unfortunately, that passion had never pointed itself in her direction despite her subtle messages, the touches that lingered a shade too long; how she maneuvered to see him first thing in the morning when she looked her best, the sexual references used in their strategy sessions. But until that time came‚Äîand it would come, she kept telling herself‚Äîshe would be patient.  
  
¬† She looked out the window. This was taking too long; it threw everything else off. Her mouth curled up in displeasure.

LUTHER HEARD THE VEHICLES ENTER THE FRONT DRIVE. HE flitted to a window and followed the mini-caravan as it went around back, where it would be hidden from view from the front drive. He counted four people alighting from the limo, one from the van. His mind scrolled swiftly through possible identities. Too small a party for it to be the owners of the house. Too many for it to be someone simply checking on the place. He could not make out any faces. For one ironic instant Luther debated whether the home was destined to be burgled twice on the same night. But that was too enormous a coincidence. In this business, like a lot of others, you played the percentages. Besides, criminals did not march up to their targets wearing clothing more suitable for a night on the town.  
  
¬† He thought quickly as noises filtered up to him, presumably from outside the rear of the house. It took him a second to realize that his retreat was cut off and to calculate what his plan of action would be.  
  
¬† Grabbing his bag, he raced to the alarm panel next to the bedroom door and activated the home‚Äôs security system, silently thanking his memory for numbers. Then Luther slipped across to the vault and entered it, carefully closing the door behind him. He pushed himself as far back into the little room as he could. Now he had to wait.  
  
¬† He cursed his misfortune; everything had been going so smoothly. Then he shook his head clear, forced himself to breathe regularly. It was like flying. The longer you did it, the greater your chance of something bad happening. He would just have to hope that the house‚Äôs most recent arrivals would have no need to make a deposit in the private bank he was now occupying.  
  
¬† A burst of laughter and then the drum of voices filtered up to him, together with the loud beep from the alarm system, which sounded like a jet plane screeching directly over his head. Apparently there was slight confusion about the security code. A bead of sweat appeared on Luther‚Äôs forehead as he envisioned the alarm exploding and the police wanting to examine every inch of the house just in case, starting with his little roost.  
  
¬† He wondered how he would react as he listened to the mirrored door being opened, a light blazing in, without the slightest possibility of missing him. The strange faces peering in, the drawn guns, the reading of his rights. He almost laughed. Trapped like a fucking rat, nowhere to go. He hadn‚Äôt had a cigarette in almost thirty years, but now he desperately craved a smoke. He put his bag down quietly and slowly let his legs out straight so they wouldn‚Äôt go to sleep.  
  
¬† Heavy steps on the oak plank staircase. Whoever they were they didn‚Äôt care who knew they were there. Luther counted four, possibly five. They turned left and headed his way.  
  
¬† The door to the bedroom opened with a slight squeak. Luther searched his mind. Everything had been picked up or put back in its place. He‚Äôd only touched the remote, and he had replaced it right in line with the slight dust pattern. Now Luther could only hear three voices, a man and two women. One of the females sounded drunk, the other was all business. Then Ms. Business disappeared, the door closed but wasn‚Äôt locked, and Ms. Drunk and the man were alone. Where were the others? Where had Ms. Business gone? The giggles continued. Footsteps came closer to the mirror. Luther scrunched down in the corner as far as he could, hoping that the chair would shield him from view but knowing that it couldn‚Äôt possibly.  
  
¬† Then a burst of light hit him right in the eyes and he almost gasped at the suddenness of his little world going from inky black to broad daylight. He blinked rapidly to adjust to the new level of brightness, his pupils going from almost full dilation to pinpoints in seconds. But there were no screams, no faces, no guns.  
  
¬† Finally, after a full minute had passed, Luther peered around the corner of the chair and received another shock. The vault door seemed to have disappeared; he was staring right into the goddamned room. He almost fell backward but caught himself. Luther suddenly understood what the chair was for.  
  
¬† He recognized both of the people in the room. The woman he had seen tonight already, in the photos: the little wife with the hooker taste in clothes.  
  
¬† The man he knew for an altogether different reason; he certainly wasn‚Äôt the master of this house. Luther slowly shook his head in amazement and let out his breath. His hands shook and a queasiness crept over him. He fought back the grip of nausea and stared into the bedroom.  
  
¬† The vault door also served as a one-way mirror. With the light on outside and darkness in his little space, it was as though he were watching a giant TV screen.  
  
¬† Then he saw it and a fist of breath kicked out of his lungs: the diamond necklace on the woman‚Äôs neck. Two hundred thou to his practiced eye, maybe more. And just the sort of bauble one would routinely put away in a home vault before retiring for the evening. Then his lungs relaxed as he watched her take the piece off and casually drop it on the floor.  
  
¬† His fear receded enough to where he rose and inched over to the chair and slowly eased himself into it. So the old man sat here and watched his little woman get her brains screwed out by a procession of men. From the looks of her, Luther figured that some members of that procession included young guys making minimum wage or hanging on to freedom by the width of a green card. But her gentleman caller tonight was in an altogether different class.  
  
¬† He looked around, his ears focused for any sound of the other inhabitants of the house. But what could he really do? In over thirty years of active larceny, he had never encountered anything like this, so he decided to do the only thing he could. With only an inch of glass separating him from absolute destruction, he settled down quietly into the deep leather and waited.  
  
¬† CHAPTER TWO  
  
¬† THREE BLOCKS FROM THE BROAD WHITE BULK OF THE UNITED States Capitol, Jack Graham opened the front door of his apartment, threw his overcoat on the floor and went straight to the fridge. Beer in hand he flopped down on the threadbare couch in his living room. His eyes quickly perused the tiny room as he took a drink. Quite a difference from where he‚Äôd just been. He let the beer stand in his mouth and then swallowed. The muscles of his square jaw tensed and then relaxed. The nagging prickles of doubt slowly drained away, but they would reappear; they always did.  
  
¬† Another important dinner party with Jennifer, his soon-to-be wife, and her family and circle of social and business acquaintances. People at that level of sophistication apparently didn‚Äôt have mere friends they hung with. Everyone served a particular function, the whole being greater than the sum of the parts. Or at least that was the intent, although Jack had his own opinion on the matter.  
  
¬† Industry and finance had been well represented, brandishing names Jack read about in the Wall Street Journal before he chucked it for the sports pages to see how the ‚ÄôSkins or Bullets were doing. The politicos had been out in full force, scrounging future votes and current dollars. The group was rounded out by the ubiquitous lawyers of which Jack was one, the occasional doctor to show ties to the old ways and a couple of public-interest types to demonstrate that the powers that be had sympathy for the plight of the ordinary.  
  
¬† He finished the beer and flipped on the TV. His shoes came off, and the forty-dollar patterned socks his fianc√©e had bought for him were carelessly flung over the back of the lamp shade. Given time she‚Äôd have him in two-hundred-dollar braces with matching hand-painted ties. Shit! Rubbing his toes, he seriously considered a second beer. The TV tried but failed to hold his interest. He pushed his thick, dark hair out of his eyes and focused for the thousandth time on where his life was hurtling, seemingly with the speed of the space shuttle.  
  
¬† Jennifer‚Äôs company limo had driven the two of them to her Northwest Washington townhouse where Jack would probably move after the wedding; she detested his place. The wedding was barely six months off, apparently no time at all by a bride‚Äôs standards, and he was sitting here having severe second thoughts.  
  
¬† Jennifer Ryce Baldwin possessed instant head-turning beauty to such a degree that the women stared as often as the men. She was also smart and accomplished, came from serious money and was intent on marrying Jack. Her father ran one of the largest devolopment companies in  
the country. Shopping centers, office buildings, radio stations, entire sub-divisions, you name it, he was in it, and doing better than just about anyone else. Her paternal great-grandfather was one of the original Midwest manufacturing tycoons, and her mother‚Äôs family had once owned a large chunk of downtown Boston. The gods had smiled early and often on Jennifer Baldwin. There wasn‚Äôt one guy Jack knew who wasn‚Äôt jealous as hell of him.  
  
¬† He squirmed in his chair and tried to rub a kink out of his shoulder. He hadn‚Äôt worked out in a week. His six-foot-one body, even at thirty-two, had the same hard edge it had enjoyed all through high school where he was a man among boys in virtually every sport offered, and in college where the competition was a lot rougher but where he still managed to make first-string varsity as a heavyweight wrestler and first-team All-Academic. That combination had gotten him into the University of Virginia School of Law, where he made Law Review , graduated near the top of his class and promptly settled down as a public defender in the District of Columbia‚Äôs criminal justice system.  
  
¬† His classmates had all grabbed the big-firm option out of law school. They had routinely called with phone numbers of psychiatrists who could help coax him out of his insanity. He smiled and then went and grabbed that second beer. The fridge was now empty.  
  
¬† Jack‚Äôs first year as a PD had been rough as he learned the ropes, losing more than he won. As time went on, he graduated to the more serious crimes. And as he poured every ounce of youthful energy, raw talent and common sense he had into each of those cases, the tide began to turn.  
  
¬† And then he started kicking some serious ass in court.  
  
¬† He discovered he was a natural at the role, as talented at cross-examination as he had been at throwing men much bigger than he across a two-inch-thick mat. He was respected, liked as an attorney if you could believe that.  
  
¬† Then he had met Jennifer at a Bar function. She was vice president of development and marketing at Baldwin Enterprises. Dynamic in presence, she had the added skill of making whomever she was talking to feel important; their opinions were listened to if not necessarily followed. She was a beauty who had no need to rely solely on that asset.  
  
¬† When you got past the eye-catching looks, there was a lot more there. Or seemed to be. Jack would have been less than human had he not been attracted to her. And she had made it clear, early on, that the attraction was mutual. While being ostensibly impressed at his dedication in defending the rights of those accused of crimes in the Capital City, little by little Jennifer had convinced Jack that he had done his bit for the poor, dumb and unfortunate, and that maybe he should start thinking about himself and his future, and that maybe she wanted to be a part of that future. When he finally left PD, the U.S. attorney‚Äôs office had given him quite a send-off party, and good riddance. That should have told him then and there that there were a lot more of the poor, dumb and unfortunate who needed his help. He didn‚Äôt expect to ever top the thrill he had felt being a PD; he figured times like that came around once in life and then they were gone. It was time to move on; even little boys like Jack Graham had to grow up someday. Maybe it was just his time.  
  
¬† He turned off the TV, grabbed a bag of corn chips and went to his bedroom, stepping over the piles of dirty laundry strewn in front of the doorway. He couldn‚Äôt blame Jennifer for not liking his place; he was a slob. But what bothered him was the dead certainty that, even spotless, Jennifer would not consent to live here. For one thing it was in the wrong neighborhood; Capitol Hill to be sure, but not a gentrified part of Capitol Hill, actually not even close.  
  
¬† Then there was the size. Her townhouse must have run five thousand square feet, not counting the live-in maid‚Äôs quarters and the two-car garage that housed her Jag and brand new Range Rover, as if anybody living in D.C., with its traffic-strangled roads, needed a vehicle capable of driving up the vertical side of a twenty-thousand-foot-high mountain.  
  
¬† He had four rooms if you counted the bathroom. He reached his bedroom, stripped off his clothes and dropped into bed. Across the room, on a small plaque that had once hung in his office at work until he had grown embarrassed looking at it, was the announcement of his joining Patton, Shaw & Lord. PS&L was the Capital City‚Äôs number-one corporate firm. Legal caterer to hundreds of blue-chip companies, including his soon-to-be father-in-law‚Äôs, representing a multimillion-dollar account that he was credited with bringing to the firm and that, in turn, guaranteed him a partnership at the next review. Partnerships at Patton, Shaw were worth, on average, at least half a million dollars a year. That was tip money for the Baldwins, but then he wasn‚Äôt a Baldwin. At least not yet.  
  
¬† He pulled the blanket over him. The building‚Äôs insulation left a lot to be desired. He popped a couple of aspirin and washed them down with the rest of a Coke that was sitting on his nightstand, then looked around the cramped, messy bedroom. It reminded him of his room growing up. It was a warm, friendly memory. Homes should look lived in; they should always give way to the screams of kids as they dashed from room to room in search of new adventures, of fresh objects to break.  
  
¬† That was the other thing with Jennifer: she had made it clear that the sound of little feet was a distant project that was far from certain. Her career at her father‚Äôs company was first and foremost in her mind and heart‚Äîmaybe more so, Jack felt, than he was.  
  
¬† He rolled over and tried to close his eyes. The wind pushed against the window and he glanced in that direction. He looked away, but then with a resigned air, his eyes drifted back over to the box.  
  
¬† It held part of his collection of old trophies and awards from high school and college. But those items were not the object of his focus. In the semidarkness he reached out a long arm for the framed photo, decided against it, and then changed his mind again.  
  
¬† He pulled it out. This had almost become a ritual. He never had to worry about his fianc√©e stumbling onto this particular possession of his because she absolutely refused to enter his bedroom for longer than a minute. Whenever they slid between the sheets it was either at her place, where Jack would lie on the bed staring up at the twelve-foot ceiling where a mural of ancient horsemen and young maidens shared space while Jennifer amused herself until she collapsed and then rolled over for him to finish on top of her. Or at her parents‚Äô place in the country where the ceilings were even higher and the murals had been taken from some thirteenth-century church in Rome, all of which made Jack feel that God was watching him being ridden by the beautiful and absolutely naked Jennifer Ryce Baldwin and that he would languish in eternal hell for those few moments of visceral pleasure.  
  
¬† The woman in the photo had silky brown hair that curled slightly at the ends. Her smile looked up at Jack and he remembered the day he had taken the picture.  
  
¬† A bike ride far into the countryside of Albemarle County. He was just starting law school; she was in her second year of college at Mr. Jefferson‚Äôs university. It was only their third date but it was like they had never lived without each other.  
  
¬† Kate Whitney.  
  
¬† He said the name slowly; his hand instinctively traced the curves of her smile, the lone dimple right above the left cheek that gave her face a slightly lopsided look. The almond-shaped cheekbones bordered a dainty nose that sloped toward a pair of sensual lips. The chin was sharp and screamed out ‚Äústubborn.‚Äù Jack moved back up the face and stopped at the large teardrop-shaped eyes that always seemed full of mischief.  
  
¬† Jack rolled back over and lay the photo on his chest so that she stared directly at him. He could never think of Kate without seeing an image of her father, with his quick wit and crooked smile.  
  
¬† Jack had often visited Luther Whitney at his little row house in an Arlington neighborhood that had seen better days. They spent hours drinking beer and telling stories, mostly Luther telling and Jack listening.  
  
¬† Kate never visited her father, and he never attempted to contact her. Jack had found his identity almost by accident, and despite Kate‚Äôs objections, Jack had wanted to get to know the man. It was a rare thing for her face to hold anything but a smile, but that  
was one thing she never smiled about.  
  
¬† After he graduated they moved to D.C. and she enrolled in law school at Georgetown. Life seemed idyllic. She came to his first few trials as he worked the butterflies from his stomach and the squeak from his throat and tried to remember which counsel table to sit at. But as the seriousness of the crimes his clients were accused of committing grew, her enthusiasm diminished.  
  
¬† They had split up his first year in practice.  
  
¬† The reasons were simple: she couldn‚Äôt understand why he had chosen to represent people who broke the law, and she could not tolerate that he liked her father.  
  
¬† At the very last breath of their lives together he remembered sitting with her in this very room and asking, pleading, for her not to leave. But she had and that was four years ago, and he hadn‚Äôt seen or heard from her since.  
  
¬† He knew that she had taken a job with the Commonwealth Attorney‚Äôs office in Alexandria, Virginia, where she was no doubt busily putting former clients of his behind bars for stomping on the laws of her adopted state. Other than that Kate Whitney was a stranger to him.  
  
¬† But lying there with her staring at him with a smile that told him a million things that he had never learned from the woman he was supposed to marry in six months, Jack wondered if Kate would remain a stranger to him; whether his life was destined to become far more complicated than he ever intended. He grabbed the phone and dialed.  
  
¬† Four rings and he heard the voice. It had an edge that he didn‚Äôt remember, or maybe it was new. The beep came and he started to leave a message, something funny, right out of the blue, but then right on cue he got nervous and quickly hung up, his hands shaking, his breathing accelerated. He shook his head. Jesus Christ! He had done five murder one cases and he was shaking like a goddamned sixteen-year-old sucking up the courage to call his first date.

For example, I've been really struggling at work with a coworker and I'm planning on quitting once the season is over (for a few other reasons, as well. But she is CERTAINLY one of them).

Now here's why she's so difficult to work with:

For majority of the day, she's sininging along to every song on the radio. Not too terrible. However, if she's not singing, she's humming. If she's not humming, she's tongue clicking along to the song. If she's not tongue clicking, she's clapping along to the song. If she's not clapping, she's stomping her feet. If she's not stomping her feet, she's patting her knees. If she's not patting her knees, she's drumming on the counter, AND SO ON.

Now I do get a grace period from time to time where she's not making sound along to the music. But it's usually for her to eat chips, and chew with her mouth open, or slurp her coffee, followed by a lip smack and gnarly exhale.

Sometimes, though, I will get moments where she's doing none of that! Pure peace and quiet. Right..?

No.

She also has chronic dry mouth, which causes her to smack and lick her lips every 5-10 seconds.

I just have to ask why. Why are some people like this? Do other people not like peace and quiet? I rarely ever make a sound at work unless I'm talking, and its not that hard. I just don't get it. :(

The weeks grew colder, the air sharper with approaching fall. Leaves began turning gold and red, a slow burn that mirrored the unease growing inside me. The townsfolk stared at me more often than ever. Their eyes were sharp like knives waiting to deliver the killing blow. With the colder weather, colder looks seemed to be descending as well.

At the diner, the usual chatter hushed when I entered. Voices fell silent like a switch had been flipped. The room felt heavier‚Ä¶ oppressive. I walked in and sat at my normal bar stool in the corner. Clara was off today‚Ä¶ in her place was Roy, an older man who knew just about everything about everyone. His grizzled appearance didn‚Äôt mask the fact that he was fairly spry for his age and could flip omelets like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. I never really liked Roy very much, but as time went by, I took any pleasantries I could find, even if they weren‚Äôt meant as such. Roy was wiping out a coffee mug with an old rag, ignoring my presence. I pulled my stool closer to the counter and tried to strike up a conversation with him.

‚ÄúDo you ever... I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ talk with folks here?‚Äù I asked, trying to sound casual.

His eyes bored holes into me, hard and cold.

‚ÄúWe talk. Just not with folks like yourself.‚Äù

I nodded as if I knew what he was talking about.

‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù I responded.

He suddenly stopped cleaning the mug. His eyes clouded over with mystery.

‚ÄúYou need to watch what comes out of your mouth around here, boy.‚Äù He said in a direct tone. ‚ÄúWe have been here a long time now‚Ä¶ and we will always be here. People like you try to come in here and poison what we have. We can‚Äôt have people coming in and ruining our little town. You understand what I‚Äôm telling you, boy?‚Äù

His demeanor completely changed. He was now leaning toward me, one elbow resting against the bar top. I started to feel threatened by his presence, but he had not yet done anything egregious. The silence lasted too long for his liking as he leaned closer toward me.

‚ÄúLet me spell it out for you‚Ä¶ Leave this place and never come back, or you‚Äôll never leave at all.‚Äù He said, staring daggers into my soul.

With that, I had heard and seen enough. I slipped off the bar stool, scrambling to grab my jacket. He leaned back off the bar top and grabbed another mug to clean. As I walked toward the door, I stopped and turned to face him.

‚ÄúThis is my home now, too. I won‚Äôt leave because of some dumb ass tradition‚Ä¶ or whatever it is.‚Äù I said confidently and with more intensity than I intended.

He looked up at me and smiled.

‚ÄúWell then, you‚Äôre dumber than you look, boy.‚Äù He said plainly and continued washing the mugs.

I made my way outside and over to my truck. As I headed back up the hill, I couldn‚Äôt get Roy‚Äôs words out of my mind.

‚ÄúLeave and don‚Äôt come back‚Ä¶ such horseshit‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled as I headed towards the cabin.

Now‚Ä¶ more than ever‚Ä¶ I needed to see her‚Ä¶ I needed to see Clara.

Clara was more distant now. When I asked her about Roy and what he meant by leaving, she brushed me off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just tradition,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúNothing to worry about, I promise! People just get worked up because they‚Äôve spent their entire lives here, and the festival is all they have left.‚Äù

I accepted her response‚Ä¶ because it came from her‚Ä¶ but I did notice some odd behavior from her that I had not seen before. Her hands shook, and her eyes darted nervously when she thought I wasn‚Äôt looking. I was so confused as to why this was all happening, and now Clara was starting to act strangely as well. I had to do something before I went insane.

The next day, I made a plan that I really didn‚Äôt want to follow through with. The plan was for me not to talk to Clara for a full day. I didn‚Äôt want to make her suspicious‚Ä¶ so after the day of not talking, I would sneak down to the diner and wait. Once she got off her shift, I would follow her and see where she went. I had never been to Clara‚Äôs house or even known where she lived, for that matter. She had never invited me over, and I never really asked about it either. I was going to find out what was going on one way or the other.

The next evening, I put my plan in motion. I stonewalled her the entire day. She texted me a few times, but I resisted the urge to respond. She eventually stopped trying. The plan was going exactly as I wanted. I made my way down the hill toward town and parked next to a snow fence just before you round the curve onto the asphalt road. I walked from there over to Harlan‚Äôs to wait for Clara‚Äôs shift to end. I followed her as she left the diner. I put my hood up, staying just far enough behind to not arouse suspicion. She moved with a strange purpose, slipping into the forest shadows... creeping and skulking through town. I kept following at a distance as she entered the forest at the edge of town. The deeper into the woods I followed, the thicker the silence grew. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, their branches clawing at the dark sky. She rounded a turn in the path, and I lost her for a moment. I picked up my speed, just enough to catch up before she got too far. I rounded the curve, and there she was. She stood in a clearing surrounded by gnarled trees, a ring of scorched stones surrounding it.

In the center of the circle, a blackened fire pit still smoldered. Around it, ashes and what looked like bits of old bone lay scattered. Once I recognized what I was seeing, I crouched quickly, clamoring behind a tree. I couldn‚Äôt see Clara anymore. The air was getting colder and darker. My heart was hammering in my chest‚Ä¶ breath catching. What was I looking at? As the question entered my mind, the coppery scent of blood hung thick in the breeze. Low, rhythmic chanting emanated from the trees around the circle. The chants started to rise like the ocean tide, growing louder and deeper with each line. A cold shiver crawled down my spine.

I peeked from behind the tree and saw them. A group of townsfolk standing in the circle‚Ä¶ eyes glazed‚Ä¶ faces expressionless. They were all wearing black robes‚Ä¶ All except for one. Clara was there; her head bowed in prayer. She was wearing a white dress that extended down past her feet. She had stripped her work uniform off and had donned this beautiful silk gown that fluttered in the chilled wind. I scanned the group and saw Tom, standing stiff and silent. The firelight flickered on faces‚Ä¶ old and young‚Ä¶ men and women alike. Gene‚Ä¶ Jimmy‚Ä¶ everyone in town was here. They chanted in a language I didn‚Äôt understand, as a group of hooded figures made their way towards the center.

Suddenly, the chanting stopped. Silence swallowed the clearing. In my horror, I had leaned too far out from behind my only cover and had been exposed. Tom saw me. His eyes turned sharply, locking onto mine. He shook his head side to side subtly, never breaking eye contact. I knew exactly what he meant‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt interfere‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt be seen‚Ä¶ I crouched behind the tree slowly and watched as the ceremony continued. Clara raised her arms toward the sky and screamed. The sound pierced the trembling night. It was oppressively loud. I covered my ears, fearing my eardrums would burst from the intense yell. The others joined in with her in unison. The fire swelled with intensity as the pitch heightened. The crescendo from the eerie band was met with a massive ball of flame that rolled from the pit and into the night sky.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I said under my breath.

I stumbled backward, heart in my throat‚Ä¶ I had to get out of here. I turned and ran away from the screams and into the night. It had gotten so dark, and the trees covered so much canopy that I could not see my hand in front of my face. I ran, hitting tree after tree and limb after limb. I could no longer hear the screams as I emerged from the forest and back onto the road. My heart was pounding in my chest. Sweat was pouring down my forehead and collecting on my shirt as it dripped.

‚ÄúFuck! What was that shit!?‚Äù I asked myself, panting uncontrollably.

I gathered myself and made my way back toward Harlan‚Äôs and hopefully back to my truck. As I passed by the diner, all the lights were off. There didn‚Äôt seem to be anybody inside or in the parking lot. I slowly crept my way past the diner, sticking to the shadows of the other buildings. I made my way past the grocery store and then the general store‚Ä¶ both dark and lifeless.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm home free if I can just get around this corner,‚Äù I muttered, trying to give myself the courage to make it back.

I made it to the next turn and hid in the shadow of the print shop. Around the corner would be the covered bridge and the snow fence where I left the bronco. I leaned against the cold concrete, gathering the courage for the final push. I took a deep breath and rounded the corner. As I made my move, I was met with what felt like a brick wall. I was knocked off my feet and fell straight to the ground. With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I scrambled to get up as quickly as possible. I felt a heavy boot come down against my chest, forcing me to the ground. As I struggled against the immense weight, a calm, raspy voice rattled its way into my ears:

‚ÄúStay down a moment, son... catch your breath.‚Äù

I panicked. Feeling a person‚Äôs boot pushing against my chest infuriated me.

‚ÄúGet the fuck off me! Let me go!‚Äù I yelled through gritted teeth, fighting the unknown figure.

The voice crackled out from the darkness above me once more,

‚ÄúRelax, Elias‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs me‚Ä¶ Tom!‚Äù

‚ÄúTom? What the fuck! Why are you doing this to me?‚Äù I exclaimed in return.

‚ÄúJust relax and I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù He said calmly.

It took me a solid minute or two of struggling against Tom‚Äôs weight before the adrenaline subsided and I was able to quell my racing mind. I let my arms fall limply to the concrete. I was hyperventilating, and the adrenaline dump made me feel extremely dizzy.

‚ÄúYou ok now, son? Are you ready to stand up?‚Äù Tom asked.

I couldn‚Äôt mutter any words through my intense breathing, but I was able to nod twice, giving him the answer he needed. He took his boot off my chest and grabbed my wrist. With what seemed like hardly any effort, he pulled me to my feet.

‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù He muttered.

I was in such shock and disarray that I didn‚Äôt know what the hell was even happening anymore. All I knew was that I had seen something that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see, and now I‚Äôm sure they wanted me dead. With no other option, I followed Tom into the darkness.

He led me back to his cabin, lit by a single lamp swinging on its chain. He hurriedly climbed the stairs and started unlocking his door. I stopped just short of the stairs, looking at the now illuminated black robe that he was wearing. I had been thrown back to that moment‚Ä¶ when he locked eyes with me. Why would he help me if he were a part of all this? Is he going to turn me over to them? These were the thoughts running through my head as he opened the door and turned to look at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doin‚Äô? Don‚Äôt just stand there. Get your ass inside‚Ä¶ now!‚Äù

I hesitated for a moment and then proceeded to follow him inside his cabin.

Once inside, Tom started to disrobe. He was pulling at the waist strap as he pointed at a chair by the fireplace.

‚ÄúSit down over there. We‚Äôve got a lot to discuss.‚Äù He said sternly.

As he disappeared into the darker side of the cabin, I walked over to the fireplace and sat down. A few moments later, Tom returned without the black robe. Ironically, he had changed into the exact opposite‚Ä¶ a cream-colored sweater and blue jeans. My eyes never left him as he meandered over to the pile of logs next to the fire. He picked up a few in his arms and turned his head to look at me.

‚ÄúI bet your head is all kinds of crazy right now, ain‚Äôt it?‚Äù He said with a hint of sarcasm.

He began stacking the wood and lighting it, producing a warm flame that lit the entire room. I stayed silent, hoping that he would get the hint that I did not even remotely trust him anymore. He was going to have to explain himself in detail before I would believe a word he said. He sat down in a chair next to mine, studying the flames with his eyes.

‚ÄúYou want a drink?‚Äù He asked.

I remained silent, my mind still reeling from what I had just endured. He stood up, grabbed a couple of glasses from the table, and a decanter full of whiskey. He poured both glasses half full and then offered one to me.

‚ÄúHere ya go.‚Äù He set the glass down on the table in front of me and took a sip of his own.

The silence lingered in the air for a moment or two‚Ä¶ the crackling fire filling the void between us. He finally spoke, cutting the silence like a knife.

‚ÄúThis town...‚Äù he began, voice low, ‚Äúit survives on a ritual‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused for a moment and then continued.

¬†‚ÄúEvery fall, at the harvest, they offer a sacrifice... To keep the people‚Ä¶ young and healthy.‚Äù

I stared at him, maintaining my silent demeanor.

‚ÄúYa see, the funny thing about this sacrificial business is that it‚Äôs gotten harder to perform over the years. The early years were easy, and nobody batted an eye. But now‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just a lot harder than it used to be.‚Äù He took another swallow of whiskey.

I could see that the man was being sincere with his words. He was telling me the truth. Though all my being told me not to, I spoke up.

‚ÄúWho... who do they sacrifice?‚Äù I asked.

Tom‚Äôs gaze didn‚Äôt waver.

‚ÄúOutsiders... Every year, they pick someone not from here. Someone who doesn‚Äôt belong‚Ä¶ someone who blows into town on a whim. Years ago, before all this technology, it was easy to make one person disappear‚Ä¶ Nobody noticed.‚Äù

The room seemed to close in on us both.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked, voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúBecause if they don‚Äôt, the town‚Ä¶ turns. The people become somethin‚Äô else‚Ä¶ somethin‚Äô angry‚Ä¶ savage.‚Äù He took a drink and continued, ‚ÄúAnd then‚Ä¶ if they don‚Äôt get it done by the end of the winter‚Ä¶ they all die‚Ä¶ includin‚Äô me.‚Äù

The weight of the words poured from his lips like molasses. A cold sweat broke out over me as I began to understand the reason why the people had acted that way toward me.

‚ÄúYou mean... I‚Äôm next?‚Äù

He nodded grimly, staring into the fire as if searching for comfort.

‚ÄúAfraid so, son‚Ä¶ I must admit, I don't enjoy this type of thing, though‚Ä¶ When I came back from ‚ÄòNam, I was a different man‚Ä¶ hell‚Ä¶ I was a different person altogether. I had seen things that would make Friday the 13^(th) look like a puppet show.‚Äù

I looked at the floor, watching the fire‚Äôs light dance across the beams.

‚ÄúWell... If I‚Äôm next, then why haven‚Äôt you killed me yet?‚Äù I asked plainly.

Tom smirked and blew air out of his nose in a slight chuckle.

‚ÄúElias, I could‚Äôve killed you the day I met you. I could‚Äôve killed you on the pavement earlier with my bare hands‚Ä¶ did you ever stop to think that maybe I don‚Äôt want to kill you?‚Äù he asked, staring directly into my eyes.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ No, I guess not.‚Äù I responded half-heartedly.

Tom picked up his glass and downed the rest of his whiskey before standing and walking over to me. I flinched a bit as his imposing presence stood over me. He put his hand on my shoulder and spoke with a solemn tone that I‚Äôd never heard from him before.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, Elias‚Ä¶ tired of livin‚Äô‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs nothin‚Äô but problems and attitudes nowadays‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve died over there in that jungle‚Ä¶ in that hell‚Ä¶‚Äù his eyes seemed to drift as if he could see something in the air that I could not. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm ready to hang it up, son‚Ä¶ and I need your help to do that.‚Äù

With that, he patted my shoulder and began walking away toward the back of his cabin.

‚ÄúBlankets are on the couch. You'd best get some sleep. We have a big day tomorrow.‚Äù Tom remarked as he disappeared into the dark.

I sat alone, pondering everything. The cabin‚Ä¶ Harlan‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Clara‚Ä¶ everything‚Ä¶ was it all just a setup? Was any of it true at all?

The woods outside seemed darker now, alive with a hunger I could no longer ignore. Indigo Falls was a town built on blood to fulfill their needs. This year, I was their prize.",1,1749321187.0,WritersOfHorror,0,1.0,False

Fall/Winter faves: Khamrah Qawha, Asad, Supremacy NOI, CDNIM, Caprice

Chopping Block (about to sell): Qaed Al-Fursan, Emeer, Imperium



quick review/purchase date, from left to right

* Khadlaj Island (JPG *Le Beau Le Parfum*): May '25
   * Solid performance & DNA, better than Glacier Bold which I sold
   * Smells fruity & tropical coconut like Old Spice Fiji but with more woods
   * $30 I got a decent steal for the performance-value



* Lattafa Caprice (YSL *Bleu Electrique*): May '25
   * Aromatic & powdery clean. Smells like a mix of freshness from baby powder & shower gel, which is a good combo imo
   * Almost reminds me of the fresh-powder accord in Chanel's Allure Eau Extreme, but a winter version



* Fragrance World Imperium (Roja *Elysium*): April '24
   * Might be on the chopping block to sell or trade
   * It was hella cheap on Amazon, $15 was too hard to pass up anyway
   * It's pretty close to Elysium but I don't think it's as zingy bright & versatile as the OG; I haven't been reaching for it really.



* Emir Voux Zingy (Xerjoff *Torino 21*): May '24
   * Hmm, I like it but maybe not the best blind buy as it comes off minty-fresh with an earthy touch from the verbena, as the herbs pop more than the citrus
   * Soothing spa vibes on the dry down. Smells like a aromatherapy lotion from Bath & BodyWorks
   * Its starting to transition towards Torino 21 on the far dry down but the opening is marked by a fairly different profile



* Lattafa Khamra Qawha (Original DNA?): May '24
   * I got this in a trade (for Glacier Bold) and holy vanilla, batman! Fleeced that guy!
   * It opens really cinnamon heavy, which I usually don't love. The guy I traded with said it reminds him of a whiskey drink at Christmas. I don't think its particularly boozy, but it is sweet & comforting like a drink would be around Xmas
   * I don't get any coffee itself, but I think its a note that adds to the darker blend 
   * Dries down with a sultry, rich vanilla. It's downright seductive yet unisex.
   * Mass appealing cold weather scent that is sweet, spicy, and warm.
   * SUPER great performance. On hydrated skin this will stick to me about 10 hours, with the first 4-5 being noticeable.



* ***Missoni Wave*** (Versace *Pour Homme*): Jan '23
   * This one is getting repurchased! Almost done with my first bottle.
   * Truly a gem in the cheapie world.
   * A great magnetic cap! For the price it's amazing.
   * Like the Versace, it is timeless and impossible to dislike.
   * Fresh, lightly salty & aquatic, and modernly masculine, this one could be the only bottle that would basically work all year except winter.
   * For those of you who don't want to fall into the fragrance collecting rabbit hole, you could pick this one up and be covered for 90% of occasions



* Lattafa Asad (Dior *Sauvage Elixir*): June '25
   * I fell in love with the OG scent profile as it is aggressively masculine with a throwback style.
   * However I never was able to stomach a $200 1.7oz bottle
   * Even discounters at $140 that's a bit rich for me because I would want to rock it as a winter daily.
   * Picked this one up in a trade a few days ago and it's pretty close! I know it's macerated already bc the guy owned it for a while. The scent is fully matured.
   * Doesn't last as long but the spice profile is basically the same so I don't mind reapplying
   * For the price I can't complain! It was almost everything I'm looking for minus the performance & ruggedness.
   * I'll likely get a used bottle of the OG at some point anyway



* Fragrance World Neroli Riviera (Tom Ford *Neroli Portofino*):
   * Very sunscreen-ish in the opening and jasmine heavy when dry
   * ¬†it is much more synthetic than the OG.
   * The opening literally smells like sunscreen so it is kind of hard to wear at times because it smells like you just applied sunscreen before being pool side.
   * The mid to dry down is good though, it is fairly heavy in jasmine, white florals which I dig, believe it or not.
   * I'd give it about a 85-90% overall but I think there are closer dupes to the original TF.
   * Specifically ""Neroli Canvas"" by Al Haramain is supposed to be a beast mode clone to the OG but for a higher price :(
   * For $17, its pretty good I would give it a 7/10



* ***Lattafa Maahir Legacy*** (Parfums de Marley *Sedley*): May '24, Oct '24, Dec '24
   * Unpopular opinion: TOP 3 IN MY COLLECTION!!!
   * I have repurchased this 3 times in 18 months
   * been in my rotation HEAVY since the first purchase
   * I had never smelled Sedley before but after smelling at the mall, I can confirm I will never buy the PDM as it is overpriced. This gets me 90% there & I'm cool with that!



* ***Arabiyat Prestige Marwa*** (Louis Vuitton ***Imagination***): May '25
   * WOW! THIS IS THE BEST LV CLONE I'VE EVER TRIED! On the first day, I wore it to work (as a nurse) and all my staff/patients were asking what soap I use.
   * Non-stop compliments, what a confidence booster but for shy folks, it may be too much attention ü§£
   * It doesn't smell like a fragrance, it smells like you lathered expensive soap in a steaming shower mixed with a ***captivating*** tea note that really is the cherry on top.
   * The tea in this is both mysterious and alluring, because they will be wondering how you got to smell like that, then they start to follow your sillage & ask that question.
   * Simply put, you will smell AGGRESSIVELY clean but a natural, soft, effortless type of clean
   * Performance was solid, easily reaching the 8 hour mark but it calms way down by the 4-5 hours. It pushes outward pretty hard
   * Marwa captures the essence of Imagination very closely, *especially* the tea note!
   * It is both soapy & herbal, while being sophisticated & luxurious just like the original.
   * Side by side with a sample from the LV store, they were virtually indistinguishable.
   * LV did have a higher quality balance from all the notes especially the citrus, coming off more 'watery' and 'effervescent' but that is absolutely nit-picking
   * Marwa's opening is sharper & piercing, but only for the first 30 seconds or so,
   * In the air, NOBODY will tell the difference.
   * I finished Jo Milano Full House & I liked that one, but it was more soap than tea.
   * Average performance, I would reapply every 2-3 hours to keep my scent bubble
   * Aqua Dubai was ALL soap, no tea but still nice with good performance



* Lattafa Emeer (Clive Christian *Town & Country*): May '25
   * chopping block as this thing is for sale at the moment
   * One of my few bad blind buys. Not because I hate the DNA, but I think it leans too old-school barbershop foug√®re for my tastes; this would BANG in the 1940s
   * the opening is solid! Super sharp lemon smell that is classy & earthy, somewhat similar to Dior Homme Sport 21 in a way
   * It is very mature, masculine and HEAVILY spiced.
   * Unisex my ass! I don't see any woman wearing this but that's just me
   * The cardamom is explosively sharp & abrasive, burning my nose hairs
   * Close to nuclear performance especially on skin, dries down in a similar way to Supremacy Not Only Intense
   * I love the bottle, eye catching red/gold with LED lights inside the box
   * Some may get trypophobia triggered looking at the bottle, I can tell



* Rasasi Hawas Ice (*Invictus Aqua*): May '24
   * Summer staple! Super fruity, sweet, aquatic yet aromatic, it has a subtle heart of middle eastern spice (again cardamom) that gives it a dirtier edge that I can appreciate.
   * Cheap! If you are a young guy, this could easily be a signature daily during the warmer months
   * Do not overspray! More than 3-4 max will be too ""candy flossy"" cloying & sickly sweet like cherry medicine or something.
   * Strong performer \~ 8 hours, pushes hard for 2-3 hours 
   * Overall I like Mont Blanc's *Legend Spirit* more as it is not as strong and has a cleaner, aquatic bubblegum style that I think is even more versatile yet has weaker performance 



* Rasasi It's Essential (YSL *L'Homme Ultime*): May '25
   * Never smelled the OG before but my roommate owns the regular *L'Homme.*
   * I don't get as much ginger, as the citrus and florals take the spotlight while still being zingy
   * It is floral sweet, bright lavender aromatic and kinda like shower gel
   * It dries down into a spicier tobacco like note, almost like a ""shisha"" for hookah
   * If anything, it's a slightly more middle eastern take which makes sense
   * Performance hasn't been great (5 hours) but I have put this one in jail so it can get stronger.
   * Has anyone done a comparison between this and Armaf Infinity Silver?



* Lattafa Liam Blue Shine (Acqua di Gio *Profondo*): May '25
   * Solid summer freshie!
   * Doesn't get as marine salty like the OG (which is my fav part) but captures the oceanic freshness pretty well.
   * I think I might sample a few other *Profondo* clones to see who gets the closest, but part of me just wants to pony up for the original.



* Afnan Turathi Blue (Bulgari *Tygar*): Oct '24
   * Broke the bottle so had to dump it into a generic bottleüòÜ
   * I like this one too! Started off weak but got much stronger after a while
   * Bright, uplifting ginger-grapefruit combo that is pretty easy to wear
   * Someone on this sub commented that it smells like a ""urinal cake"" and now I can't help but think of that when I want to wear itüòπ
   * Might pick up Armaf's *Private Key to My Life* when it comes time to replace this one, as it is supposed to be a stronger version of this DNA but I learned my lesson and will sample it.



* Armaf Odyssey Limoni (Louis Vuitton *Afternoon Swim*): May '25
   * Citrus bomb! I love it 10/10.
   * So damn refreshing & invigorating in the Texas heat
   * It instantly transports me poolside, sunshine & happiness
   * It opens with a MASSIVE blast of candied citruses. A medley of chopped oranges, lemons, mandarins, tangelos, and the like. A true hesperidic's dream. I could smell this opening all day and never get tired of it.
   * It stays fairly linear throughout the mid about 2 hours in, drying into a creamier popsicle style of citrus which is also pretty appealing. I have caught whiffs of my own sillage working at my computer or moving my arms around (where I sprayed) and sticks to my skin super well.
   * As of the first month owning it, I don't get many notes of tea (A-la Imagination) but I will update this review 6 months in. The dry down on day 1 (4 hours in) smelled fairly tame yet clean in a 'lotion on fresh skin' kinda way, mixed with the Kitchen Lemon scent from Bath & BodyWorks (not that it smells cheap or like soap/lotion/sunscreen).
   * Bang for buck, it is a summer stunner especially if you also love citrus! I might layer it with Light Blue Eau Intense for a bitter then sweet combo.
   * Huge similarities with Afternoon Swim by Louis Vuitton in the beginning (yes I've owned decants of that one so I can comment on how close they are).
   * They do differ after 20-30 minutes as Odyssey isn't solely focused on citruses as Afternoon Swim and the former lasts longer anyway. Limoni is still pretty linear but evolves much more than Afternoon Swim ever would.



* Armaf CDN Sillage (Creed *Silver Mountain Water*): June '25
   * Snagged in a trade a few days ago
   * Pretty unique!!! and close to the OG in my opinion! Suave & masculine
   * Opens up pretty brisk, fresh & citric
   * Evolves into a heart of musky, metallic, and inky notes
   * Rests on a bed of woods that lasts a good while 



* Armaf CDNIM EDP (Creed *Aventus*): June '25
   * Snagged in the same trade as *Sillage*, super solid since it is the 200mL jumbo size
   * I owned the EDT in 2021 but sold it for quick cash as it was my very first bottle I purchased in a long time, effectively starting my collection. Then I was back to square one.
   * Smokey, fruity and musky! Everyone on this sub is aware of this one so I won't get too into detail but the smoke aspect is slightly ""dry"" like a earthy vetiver.  
   * Performance hasn't been great thus far which is surprising from a 2023 batch but I am giving it time and definitely not selling it this time around. Maybe I'm just going nose blind to this ambroxan bomb.



* Afnan Supremacy Not Only Intense (Nishane *Hacivat*): Jan '23
   * The first bottle I purchased when truly starting my collection, when I began to fall into the rabbit hole on this sub, YouTube & TikTok.
   * I didn't like it as much as a blind buy, but it has grown on me a whole lot
   * Has gotten super strong in the time which has made me appreciate it more
   * Opens fruity, hanging a dark musk in the air, and dries oakmoss-earthy
   * Also has a ink type of note, getting almost metallic on the far dry down especially the light whiffs I catch from taking off my jacket, etc
   * Mostly towards the *Hacivat side* but is highly redundant with *CDNIM* & *Aventus.* 



* Lattafa Qaed Al-Fursan (OG-ish DNA): Dec '24
   * Chopping block! Might sell this synthetic mess
   * This one has transitioned from a ""like"", to a ""love"", all the way back down to a ""dislike""
   * I got it for Xmas. Sprayed 30 times and let it sit in the box for a while.
   * A few weeks in, I gave it a test wear.
   * It was a MEGA pineapple bomb, like I spilled juice on my skin/clothes
   * That syrupy sweet musk resonated within my nose and it was so surprising
   * Fast forward a few months, it has changed, and I like it less now.
   * The saffron & oud spices have come to the forefront with the pineapple, so it's a combo I don't enjoy as much
   * Slightly darker (more pungent & oriental, a scent that smells more Middle Eastern; not a bad thin, just a different style for most Western noses).
   * In the early weeks, I'd give it an 8/10. Now I'd say more like a 5/10, but for $17, I can't complain too much.
   * If it stayed like pineapple juice alone, I would be rocking it every single day as soon as I wake up. Now, I tend to reach for it less, enough to warrant selling it to someone else.",2,1749321149.0,fragranceclones,6,1.0,False
1l5rrhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l5rrhj/best_friends_with_ex_type_situation_23f_26m/,Best friends with ex type situation (23F 26M) ‚Äì problematic?,"I‚Äôm (23F) currently very good friends with a guy (26M). We‚Äôre in contact via text almost every day, we typically see each other at least once a week, sometimes he‚Äôll randomly call me to talk. We can hang out indefinitely without getting tired of each other. He lives very close to my place, so we sometimes just hang out at his place. In fact, I have a key to his place (he has a very nice balcony and works during the day, I‚Äôm a student and more flexible with my time, the reason was that I can use the balcony during the day).

Now you might be asking, why aren‚Äôt we dating. And as a matter of fact, we did, briefly. It‚Äôs a bit of a complicated story though. Essentially, when we first became close, we also started dating, for about a month. At that time, I was fresh out of a long term relationship and less over it than I thought. After a month, I ended it, essentially because I wasn‚Äôt ready for anything real, even though at the time I didn‚Äôt realize it like that. We weren‚Äôt in contact for about two weeks, then he reached out again, we went for coffee and became friends again. We became pretty close, and with time, I started to develop feelings for him. I struggled with this for a bit, given that I had ended it and didn‚Äôt want to lead him on, and then eventually told him, shortly before Christmas. He then told me that he had actually always been unsure if he could see a relationship with me. I still ended up sleeping over at his place (we didn‚Äôt have sex, in fact we never really had sex during this whole thing). I left at 4 am. We then both went home for Christmas and had a bit of back and forth over text, with him saying he wanted to give dating a shot and me not seeing the point if he felt how he told me he felt that day. When we came back, we did end up sort of dating, for a week. After that week, he restarted the conversation and told me he was pretty sure he couldn‚Äôt see a relationship with me. We then again weren‚Äôt in contact for a week and afterwards became friends again.

In hindsight, I wasn‚Äôt immediately over it after that week. I do consider myself over it now (all of this was six months ago), and I don‚Äôt have feelings for him anymore and wouldn't want to be in a relationship with him. However, I do feel like the level of closeness we currently have is borderline too much, because it can feel too similar to a relationship, and it sometimes reopens that Pandora‚Äôs box in my brain. And we do find each other physically attractive, obviously, although I‚Äôm not sure if the sex would be very good if we‚Äôd ever have it, so that‚Äôs not really a desire I have. He did once suggest being friends with benefits, which I turned down since I felt the risk of catching feelings was too high.

I realize all of this sounds weird and problematic. I think in a way we are kind of placeholders for a partner in each others lives right now, and if one of us started dating someone, we‚Äôd automatically become less close, both out of respect for the partner and because someone else would fill that gap.

I‚Äôm also unsure what the optimal solution to this situation is. I value him as a friend and don‚Äôt think a connection like this happens that often, so I don‚Äôt want to completely cut him out of my life. We seem to naturally gravitate towards a situation like this, where we‚Äôre very close, talk a lot, hang out until late, etc., but at the same time I sometimes feel like that is too much for me, given how I‚Äôve felt about him in the past (for example, I recently briefly imagined him kissing another girl and felt jealous).

Do you have any advice for this kind of situation and how I could set boundaries to keep it somewhat healthy? Is it possible? Does anyone have experience with something similar?",0,1749321129.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

The leather laptop tote is an essential accessory for the modern professional, blending functionality and style seamlessly. It offers a complex way to carry a laptop and other essentials while maintaining a polished appearance. This review will dissect the key features, benefits, and considerations when selecting the perfect leather laptop tote in 2025, ensuring that you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The best leather laptop totes offer a combination of durability, association, and aesthetic appeal. Let's examine the crucial elements that define their quality and functionality.

**Material Quality**

the foundation of any excellent leather laptop tote is the quality of the leather itself. Full-grain leather, known for its durability and natural beauty, is often preferred for its ability to develop a rich patina over time. Top-grain leather, while slightly less expensive, still offers a good balance of quality and affordability. Bonded leather should generally be avoided as it lacks longevity and the luxurious feel of genuine leather. The stitching should also be inspected for tightness and uniformity, indicating careful craftsmanship and long-term resilience.

**Laptop Compartment Protection**

A dedicated laptop compartment is a must-have for any leather tote designed to carry technology. This compartment should be padded with shock-absorbing materials like foam or quilted lining to safeguard the laptop from bumps and drops.The size of the compartment should be clearly defined, accommodating specific laptop dimensions (e.g.,13-inch,15-inch,or 17-inch models). Secure closures, such as zippers or magnetic snaps, are essential to keep the laptop securely in place during transit.

**Organizational Features**

Moving beyond the laptop compartment, the tote's organizational features greatly impact its practicality. Look for multiple interior pockets to store items like smartphones, tablets, pens, and notebooks. A key clip can be incredibly useful for keeping keys readily accessible. Consider the number and placement of pockets based on your individual needs and the types of items you typically carry. An exterior pocket can be valuable for quick access to items like a train ticket or a water bottle.

**Handles and Shoulder Straps**

The carrying system of a leather laptop tote plays a crucial role in comfort and usability. Sturdy,reinforced handles are essential for hand-carrying,and they should be pleasant to grip for extended periods. A detachable and adjustable shoulder strap offers versatility, allowing you to carry the tote over your shoulder or across your body. The strap should be wide enough to distribute weight evenly and prevent digging into your shoulder. Look for features like padded shoulder straps for enhanced comfort, especially when carrying heavier loads.

**Hardware and Closure Mechanisms**

The quality of the hardware, such as zippers, buckles, and clasps, influences both the functionality and longevity of your tote. Opt for durable metal hardware, like brass or stainless steel, that can withstand daily wear and tear. Zippers should glide smoothly without snagging, and closures should be secure and easy to operate. Magnetic closures should be strong enough to keep the tote securely closed but not so strong that they are challenging to open.

**Overall Size and Weight**

The overall size and weight of the leather laptop tote are important considerations, especially if you'll be carrying it for long periods of time or commuting regularly. A larger tote can accommodate more items, but it will also be heavier and perhaps more cumbersome. Consider the dimensions of the tote in relation to your laptop and other essentials to ensure that it provides adequate space without being excessively bulky. A lighter tote will be more comfortable to carry, especially when fully loaded.

## Core Benefits

A well-designed leather laptop tote provides a multitude of benefits beyond simply carrying a laptop. It combines practicality, style, and durability, making it a valuable investment for professionals and students alike.

**Professional Appearance:** The leather laptop tote exudes professionalism and sophistication, enhancing your overall style in business settings. Using a stylish leather bag provides a polished and refined image, crucial for meetings, presentations, and networking events. This elevates you compared to carrying tech in a generic backpack or plastic bag.

**protected Technology:** A dedicated, padded laptop compartment safeguards your valuable technology from bumps, scratches, and accidental drops. The design protects electronics from daily commute rigors, ensuring that a laptop isn't damaged during travel. This security provides peace of mind and potentially avoids costly repairs or replacements.

**Efficient Organization:** Multiple pockets and compartments help to organize everyday essentials, such as a phone, wallet, keys, and documents, enabling you to find items quickly and easily. Organized space promotes efficiency, keeps necessary items accessible, and reduces clutter and frustration during a busy workday, especially when having to find important documents or tech accessories quickly

**Versatile Functionality:** A leather laptop tote is adaptable to various situations, such as business meetings, travel, or everyday commuting, effortlessly transitioning between professional and casual settings. This versatile design allows one bag to serve multiple purposes, reducing the need to switch between different bags for each activity. This is an immediate benefit that makes daily life easier.

**long-Term Value:** High-quality leather totes are built to last, developing a unique patina and character over time, making them a worthwhile investment that can endure years of use. Premium leather ensures durability, a timeless style, and provides lasting usage and value compared to mass-produced alternatives. The durable investment will last through many years of use without showing wear.

## faqs Section

**Will a 15-inch laptop fit comfortably in this tote?**

It depends on the specific dimensions of both the tote's laptop compartment and your laptop. Always check the listed dimensions before purchasing. Most totes advertised as ""15-inch"" should accommodate standard 15-inch laptops, but make sure to allow for slight variations in size across different brands and models.

**How do I properly care for and maintain a leather laptop tote?**

Regularly clean the tote with a soft, damp cloth to remove surface dirt and dust. Use a leather conditioner every few months to keep the leather supple and prevent it from drying out or cracking. Store the tote in a dust bag when not in use, and avoid exposing it to excessive heat or moisture. Promptly clean any spills or stains to prevent them from setting into the leather.

**Is the shoulder strap adjustable for different heights?**

yes, most leather laptop totes come with an adjustable shoulder strap to accommodate different body types and carrying preferences. The adjustability should allow you to find a comfortable length for both shoulder and crossbody carrying, depending on your individual needs.**What is the weight capacity of the leather laptop tote?**

The weight capacity will vary depending on the particular model and the durability of its construction. However, most well-made leather laptop totes can comfortably carry a laptop, a few books, a wallet, and other everyday essentials, typically equating to a weight capacity of 10-15 pounds. Avoid overloading the tote, as this can strain the seams and hardware over time.

I don't think it's the going out less part, it seems whenever I want to go someplace different for a canned/premade beverage (N/A beer/THC/cold brew) there'll maybe be a handful or more people at best and yet I might not even get acknowledged in five minutes for my order if it's a bar. If I have to pick up my beverage at the other end of the coffee shop counter after already tipping I'll be standing there 10, 15 or more minutes before anyone acknowledges my existence and pours my beverage in a few seconds from a tap or grabs a can and hands it to me. This is basically an ongoing 50/50 gamble with the bars picking up the majority of the slack.

The weeks grew colder, the air sharper with approaching fall. Leaves began turning gold and red, a slow burn that mirrored the unease growing inside me. The townsfolk stared at me more often than ever. Their eyes were sharp like knives waiting to deliver the killing blow. With the colder weather, colder looks seemed to be descending as well.

At the diner, the usual chatter hushed when I entered. Voices fell silent like a switch had been flipped. The room felt heavier‚Ä¶ oppressive. I walked in and sat at my normal bar stool in the corner. Clara was off today‚Ä¶ in her place was Roy, an older man who knew just about everything about everyone. His grizzled appearance didn‚Äôt mask the fact that he was fairly spry for his age and could flip omelets like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. I never really liked Roy very much, but as time went by, I took any pleasantries I could find, even if they weren‚Äôt meant as such. Roy was wiping out a coffee mug with an old rag, ignoring my presence. I pulled my stool closer to the counter and tried to strike up a conversation with him.

‚ÄúDo you ever... I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ talk with folks here?‚Äù I asked, trying to sound casual.

His eyes bored holes into me, hard and cold.

‚ÄúWe talk. Just not with folks like yourself.‚Äù

I nodded as if I knew what he was talking about.

‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù I responded.

He suddenly stopped cleaning the mug. His eyes clouded over with mystery.

‚ÄúYou need to watch what comes out of your mouth around here, boy.‚Äù He said in a direct tone. ‚ÄúWe have been here a long time now‚Ä¶ and we will always be here. People like you try to come in here and poison what we have. We can‚Äôt have people coming in and ruining our little town. You understand what I‚Äôm telling you, boy?‚Äù

His demeanor completely changed. He was now leaning toward me, one elbow resting against the bar top. I started to feel threatened by his presence, but he had not yet done anything egregious. The silence lasted too long for his liking as he leaned closer toward me.

‚ÄúLet me spell it out for you‚Ä¶ Leave this place and never come back, or you‚Äôll never leave at all.‚Äù He said, staring daggers into my soul.

With that, I had heard and seen enough. I slipped off the bar stool, scrambling to grab my jacket. He leaned back off the bar top and grabbed another mug to clean. As I walked toward the door, I stopped and turned to face him.

‚ÄúThis is my home now, too. I won‚Äôt leave because of some dumb ass tradition‚Ä¶ or whatever it is.‚Äù I said confidently and with more intensity than I intended.

He looked up at me and smiled.

‚ÄúWell then, you‚Äôre dumber than you look, boy.‚Äù He said plainly and continued washing the mugs.

I made my way outside and over to my truck. As I headed back up the hill, I couldn‚Äôt get Roy‚Äôs words out of my mind.

‚ÄúLeave and don‚Äôt come back‚Ä¶ such horseshit‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled as I headed towards the cabin.

Now‚Ä¶ more than ever‚Ä¶ I needed to see her‚Ä¶ I needed to see Clara.

Clara was more distant now. When I asked her about Roy and what he meant by leaving, she brushed me off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just tradition,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúNothing to worry about, I promise! People just get worked up because they‚Äôve spent their entire lives here, and the festival is all they have left.‚Äù

I accepted her response‚Ä¶ because it came from her‚Ä¶ but I did notice some odd behavior from her that I had not seen before. Her hands shook, and her eyes darted nervously when she thought I wasn‚Äôt looking. I was so confused as to why this was all happening, and now Clara was starting to act strangely as well. I had to do something before I went insane.

The next day, I made a plan that I really didn‚Äôt want to follow through with. The plan was for me not to talk to Clara for a full day. I didn‚Äôt want to make her suspicious‚Ä¶ so after the day of not talking, I would sneak down to the diner and wait. Once she got off her shift, I would follow her and see where she went. I had never been to Clara‚Äôs house or even known where she lived, for that matter. She had never invited me over, and I never really asked about it either. I was going to find out what was going on one way or the other.

The next evening, I put my plan in motion. I stonewalled her the entire day. She texted me a few times, but I resisted the urge to respond. She eventually stopped trying. The plan was going exactly as I wanted. I made my way down the hill toward town and parked next to a snow fence just before you round the curve onto the asphalt road. I walked from there over to Harlan‚Äôs to wait for Clara‚Äôs shift to end. I followed her as she left the diner. I put my hood up, staying just far enough behind to not arouse suspicion. She moved with a strange purpose, slipping into the forest shadows... creeping and skulking through town. I kept following at a distance as she entered the forest at the edge of town. The deeper into the woods I followed, the thicker the silence grew. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, their branches clawing at the dark sky. She rounded a turn in the path, and I lost her for a moment. I picked up my speed, just enough to catch up before she got too far. I rounded the curve, and there she was. She stood in a clearing surrounded by gnarled trees, a ring of scorched stones surrounding it.

In the center of the circle, a blackened fire pit still smoldered. Around it, ashes and what looked like bits of old bone lay scattered. Once I recognized what I was seeing, I crouched quickly, clamoring behind a tree. I couldn‚Äôt see Clara anymore. The air was getting colder and darker. My heart was hammering in my chest‚Ä¶ breath catching. What was I looking at? As the question entered my mind, the coppery scent of blood hung thick in the breeze. Low, rhythmic chanting emanated from the trees around the circle. The chants started to rise like the ocean tide, growing louder and deeper with each line. A cold shiver crawled down my spine.

I peeked from behind the tree and saw them. A group of townsfolk standing in the circle‚Ä¶ eyes glazed‚Ä¶ faces expressionless. They were all wearing black robes‚Ä¶ All except for one. Clara was there; her head bowed in prayer. She was wearing a white dress that extended down past her feet. She had stripped her work uniform off and had donned this beautiful silk gown that fluttered in the chilled wind. I scanned the group and saw Tom, standing stiff and silent. The firelight flickered on faces‚Ä¶ old and young‚Ä¶ men and women alike. Gene‚Ä¶ Jimmy‚Ä¶ everyone in town was here. They chanted in a language I didn‚Äôt understand, as a group of hooded figures made their way towards the center.

Suddenly, the chanting stopped. Silence swallowed the clearing. In my horror, I had leaned too far out from behind my only cover and had been exposed. Tom saw me. His eyes turned sharply, locking onto mine. He shook his head side to side subtly, never breaking eye contact. I knew exactly what he meant‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt interfere‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt be seen‚Ä¶ I crouched behind the tree slowly and watched as the ceremony continued. Clara raised her arms toward the sky and screamed. The sound pierced the trembling night. It was oppressively loud. I covered my ears, fearing my eardrums would burst from the intense yell. The others joined in with her in unison. The fire swelled with intensity as the pitch heightened. The crescendo from the eerie band was met with a massive ball of flame that rolled from the pit and into the night sky.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I said under my breath.

I stumbled backward, heart in my throat‚Ä¶ I had to get out of here. I turned and ran away from the screams and into the night. It had gotten so dark, and the trees covered so much canopy that I could not see my hand in front of my face. I ran, hitting tree after tree and limb after limb. I could no longer hear the screams as I emerged from the forest and back onto the road. My heart was pounding in my chest. Sweat was pouring down my forehead and collecting on my shirt as it dripped.

‚ÄúFuck! What was that shit!?‚Äù I asked myself, panting uncontrollably.

I gathered myself and made my way back toward Harlan‚Äôs and hopefully back to my truck. As I passed by the diner, all the lights were off. There didn‚Äôt seem to be anybody inside or in the parking lot. I slowly crept my way past the diner, sticking to the shadows of the other buildings. I made my way past the grocery store and then the general store‚Ä¶ both dark and lifeless.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm home free if I can just get around this corner,‚Äù I muttered, trying to give myself the courage to make it back.

I made it to the next turn and hid in the shadow of the print shop. Around the corner would be the covered bridge and the snow fence where I left the bronco. I leaned against the cold concrete, gathering the courage for the final push. I took a deep breath and rounded the corner. As I made my move, I was met with what felt like a brick wall. I was knocked off my feet and fell straight to the ground. With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I scrambled to get up as quickly as possible. I felt a heavy boot come down against my chest, forcing me to the ground. As I struggled against the immense weight, a calm, raspy voice rattled its way into my ears:

‚ÄúStay down a moment, son... catch your breath.‚Äù

I panicked. Feeling a person‚Äôs boot pushing against my chest infuriated me.

‚ÄúGet the fuck off me! Let me go!‚Äù I yelled through gritted teeth, fighting the unknown figure.

The voice crackled out from the darkness above me once more,

‚ÄúRelax, Elias‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs me‚Ä¶ Tom!‚Äù

‚ÄúTom? What the fuck! Why are you doing this to me?‚Äù I exclaimed in return.

‚ÄúJust relax and I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù He said calmly.

It took me a solid minute or two of struggling against Tom‚Äôs weight before the adrenaline subsided and I was able to quell my racing mind. I let my arms fall limply to the concrete. I was hyperventilating, and the adrenaline dump made me feel extremely dizzy.

‚ÄúYou ok now, son? Are you ready to stand up?‚Äù Tom asked.

I couldn‚Äôt mutter any words through my intense breathing, but I was able to nod twice, giving him the answer he needed. He took his boot off my chest and grabbed my wrist. With what seemed like hardly any effort, he pulled me to my feet.

‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù He muttered.

I was in such shock and disarray that I didn‚Äôt know what the hell was even happening anymore. All I knew was that I had seen something that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see, and now I‚Äôm sure they wanted me dead. With no other option, I followed Tom into the darkness.

He led me back to his cabin, lit by a single lamp swinging on its chain. He hurriedly climbed the stairs and started unlocking his door. I stopped just short of the stairs, looking at the now illuminated black robe that he was wearing. I had been thrown back to that moment‚Ä¶ when he locked eyes with me. Why would he help me if he were a part of all this? Is he going to turn me over to them? These were the thoughts running through my head as he opened the door and turned to look at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doin‚Äô? Don‚Äôt just stand there. Get your ass inside‚Ä¶ now!‚Äù

I hesitated for a moment and then proceeded to follow him inside his cabin.

Once inside, Tom started to disrobe. He was pulling at the waist strap as he pointed at a chair by the fireplace.

‚ÄúSit down over there. We‚Äôve got a lot to discuss.‚Äù He said sternly.

As he disappeared into the darker side of the cabin, I walked over to the fireplace and sat down. A few moments later, Tom returned without the black robe. Ironically, he had changed into the exact opposite‚Ä¶ a cream-colored sweater and blue jeans. My eyes never left him as he meandered over to the pile of logs next to the fire. He picked up a few in his arms and turned his head to look at me.

‚ÄúI bet your head is all kinds of crazy right now, ain‚Äôt it?‚Äù He said with a hint of sarcasm.

He began stacking the wood and lighting it, producing a warm flame that lit the entire room. I stayed silent, hoping that he would get the hint that I did not even remotely trust him anymore. He was going to have to explain himself in detail before I would believe a word he said. He sat down in a chair next to mine, studying the flames with his eyes.

‚ÄúYou want a drink?‚Äù He asked.

I remained silent, my mind still reeling from what I had just endured. He stood up, grabbed a couple of glasses from the table, and a decanter full of whiskey. He poured both glasses half full and then offered one to me.

‚ÄúHere ya go.‚Äù He set the glass down on the table in front of me and took a sip of his own.

The silence lingered in the air for a moment or two‚Ä¶ the crackling fire filling the void between us. He finally spoke, cutting the silence like a knife.

‚ÄúThis town...‚Äù he began, voice low, ‚Äúit survives on a ritual‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused for a moment and then continued.

¬†‚ÄúEvery fall, at the harvest, they offer a sacrifice... To keep the people‚Ä¶ young and healthy.‚Äù

I stared at him, maintaining my silent demeanor.

‚ÄúYa see, the funny thing about this sacrificial business is that it‚Äôs gotten harder to perform over the years. The early years were easy, and nobody batted an eye. But now‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just a lot harder than it used to be.‚Äù He took another swallow of whiskey.

I could see that the man was being sincere with his words. He was telling me the truth. Though all my being told me not to, I spoke up.

‚ÄúWho... who do they sacrifice?‚Äù I asked.

Tom‚Äôs gaze didn‚Äôt waver.

‚ÄúOutsiders... Every year, they pick someone not from here. Someone who doesn‚Äôt belong‚Ä¶ someone who blows into town on a whim. Years ago, before all this technology, it was easy to make one person disappear‚Ä¶ Nobody noticed.‚Äù

The room seemed to close in on us both.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked, voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúBecause if they don‚Äôt, the town‚Ä¶ turns. The people become somethin‚Äô else‚Ä¶ somethin‚Äô angry‚Ä¶ savage.‚Äù He took a drink and continued, ‚ÄúAnd then‚Ä¶ if they don‚Äôt get it done by the end of the winter‚Ä¶ they all die‚Ä¶ includin‚Äô me.‚Äù

The weight of the words poured from his lips like molasses. A cold sweat broke out over me as I began to understand the reason why the people had acted that way toward me.

‚ÄúYou mean... I‚Äôm next?‚Äù

He nodded grimly, staring into the fire as if searching for comfort.

‚ÄúAfraid so, son‚Ä¶ I must admit, I don't enjoy this type of thing, though‚Ä¶ When I came back from ‚ÄòNam, I was a different man‚Ä¶ hell‚Ä¶ I was a different person altogether. I had seen things that would make Friday the 13^(th) look like a puppet show.‚Äù

I looked at the floor, watching the fire‚Äôs light dance across the beams.

‚ÄúWell... If I‚Äôm next, then why haven‚Äôt you killed me yet?‚Äù I asked plainly.

Tom smirked and blew air out of his nose in a slight chuckle.

‚ÄúElias, I could‚Äôve killed you the day I met you. I could‚Äôve killed you on the pavement earlier with my bare hands‚Ä¶ did you ever stop to think that maybe I don‚Äôt want to kill you?‚Äù he asked, staring directly into my eyes.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ No, I guess not.‚Äù I responded half-heartedly.

Tom picked up his glass and downed the rest of his whiskey before standing and walking over to me. I flinched a bit as his imposing presence stood over me. He put his hand on my shoulder and spoke with a solemn tone that I‚Äôd never heard from him before.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, Elias‚Ä¶ tired of livin‚Äô‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs nothin‚Äô but problems and attitudes nowadays‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve died over there in that jungle‚Ä¶ in that hell‚Ä¶‚Äù his eyes seemed to drift as if he could see something in the air that I could not. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm ready to hang it up, son‚Ä¶ and I need your help to do that.‚Äù

With that, he patted my shoulder and began walking away toward the back of his cabin.

‚ÄúBlankets are on the couch. You'd best get some sleep. We have a big day tomorrow.‚Äù Tom remarked as he disappeared into the dark.

I sat alone, pondering everything. The cabin‚Ä¶ Harlan‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Clara‚Ä¶ everything‚Ä¶ was it all just a setup? Was any of it true at all?

The woods outside seemed darker now, alive with a hunger I could no longer ignore. Indigo Falls was a town built on blood to fulfill their needs. This year, I was their prize.",1,1749321013.0,submitcreepypasta,0,1.0,False

The weeks grew colder, the air sharper with approaching fall. Leaves began turning gold and red, a slow burn that mirrored the unease growing inside me. The townsfolk stared at me more often than ever. Their eyes were sharp like knives waiting to deliver the killing blow. With the colder weather, colder looks seemed to be descending as well.

At the diner, the usual chatter hushed when I entered. Voices fell silent like a switch had been flipped. The room felt heavier‚Ä¶ oppressive. I walked in and sat at my normal bar stool in the corner. Clara was off today‚Ä¶ in her place was Roy, an older man who knew just about everything about everyone. His grizzled appearance didn‚Äôt mask the fact that he was fairly spry for his age and could flip omelets like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. I never really liked Roy very much, but as time went by, I took any pleasantries I could find, even if they weren‚Äôt meant as such. Roy was wiping out a coffee mug with an old rag, ignoring my presence. I pulled my stool closer to the counter and tried to strike up a conversation with him.

‚ÄúDo you ever... I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ talk with folks here?‚Äù I asked, trying to sound casual.

His eyes bored holes into me, hard and cold.

‚ÄúWe talk. Just not with folks like yourself.‚Äù

I nodded as if I knew what he was talking about.

‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù I responded.

He suddenly stopped cleaning the mug. His eyes clouded over with mystery.

‚ÄúYou need to watch what comes out of your mouth around here, boy.‚Äù He said in a direct tone. ‚ÄúWe have been here a long time now‚Ä¶ and we will always be here.

The silence lingered in the air for a moment or two‚Ä¶ the crackling fire filling the void between us. He finally spoke, cutting the silence like a knife.

‚ÄúThis town...‚Äù he began, voice low, ‚Äúit survives on a ritual‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused for a moment and then continued.

¬†‚ÄúEvery fall, at the harvest, they offer a sacrifice... To keep the people‚Ä¶ young and healthy.‚Äù

I stared at him, maintaining my silent demeanor.

‚ÄúYa see, the funny thing about this sacrificial business is that it‚Äôs gotten harder to perform over the years. The early years were easy, and nobody batted an eye. But now‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just a lot harder than it used to be.‚Äù He took another swallow of whiskey.

I could see that the man was being sincere with his words. He was telling me the truth. Though all my being told me not to, I spoke up.

‚ÄúWho... who do they sacrifice?‚Äù I asked.

Tom‚Äôs gaze didn‚Äôt waver.

‚ÄúOutsiders... Every year, they pick someone not from here. Someone who doesn‚Äôt belong‚Ä¶ someone who blows into town on a whim. Years ago, before all this technology, it was easy to make one person disappear‚Ä¶ Nobody noticed.‚Äù

The room seemed to close in on us both.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked, voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúBecause if they don‚Äôt, the town‚Ä¶ turns. The people become somethin‚Äô else‚Ä¶ somethin‚Äô angry‚Ä¶ savage.‚Äù He took a drink and continued, ‚ÄúAnd then‚Ä¶ if they don‚Äôt get it done by the end of the winter‚Ä¶ they all die‚Ä¶ includin‚Äô me.‚Äù

The weight of the words poured from his lips like molasses. A cold sweat broke out over me as I began to understand the reason why the people had acted that way toward me.

‚ÄúYou mean... I‚Äôm next?‚Äù

He nodded grimly, staring into the fire as if searching for comfort.

‚ÄúAfraid so, son‚Ä¶ I must admit, I don't enjoy this type of thing, though‚Ä¶ When I came back from ‚ÄòNam, I was a different man‚Ä¶ hell‚Ä¶ I was a different person altogether. I had seen things that would make Friday the 13^(th) look like a puppet show.‚Äù

I looked at the floor, watching the fire‚Äôs light dance across the beams.

‚ÄúWell... If I‚Äôm next, then why haven‚Äôt you killed me yet?‚Äù I asked plainly.

Tom smirked and blew air out of his nose in a slight chuckle.

‚ÄúElias, I could‚Äôve killed you the day I met you. I could‚Äôve killed you on the pavement earlier with my bare hands‚Ä¶ did you ever stop to think that maybe I don‚Äôt want to kill you?‚Äù he asked, staring directly into my eyes.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ No, I guess not.‚Äù I responded half-heartedly.

Tom picked up his glass and downed the rest of his whiskey before standing and walking over to me. I flinched a bit as his imposing presence stood over me. He put his hand on my shoulder and spoke with a solemn tone that I‚Äôd never heard from him before.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, Elias‚Ä¶ tired of livin‚Äô‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs nothin‚Äô but problems and attitudes nowadays‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve died over there in that jungle‚Ä¶ in that hell‚Ä¶‚Äù his eyes seemed to drift as if he could see something in the air that I could not. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm ready to hang it up, son‚Ä¶ and I need your help to do that.‚Äù

With that, he patted my shoulder and began walking away toward the back of his cabin.

‚ÄúBlankets are on the couch. You'd best get some sleep. We have a big day tomorrow.‚Äù Tom remarked as he disappeared into the dark.

I sat alone, pondering everything. The cabin‚Ä¶ Harlan‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Clara‚Ä¶ everything‚Ä¶ was it all just a setup? Was any of it true at all?

outside of the game, i have a deep love for ecology and physiology. i lean into these loves in trying to make environments that feel otherworldly, but also grounded - i want them to ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù. so it i introduce a homebrew monster, having it fit into a larger food chain or ecological system tickles my brain. i LOVED the way they incorporated that in delicious in dungeon. huge fan of rain world for similar reasons.

in each of my campaigns, Ive leaned much heavier into roleplay, such that combat encounters feel VERY impactful. I dislike the whole ‚Äòget your shit absolutely rocked and then sleep it off‚Äô vibe that DnD combat uses. If a player is injured, i think treating that injury should be a little more involved then going to bed. I often homebrew rules around this; ex. maybe a player loses an eye, or breaks a leg - giving that player a disadvantage to either perception or athletics rolls until they find a more involved way to address the problem. 

i spend a lot of my time dming asking players questions about their inner thoughts or feelings to try and help players sink into their characters mind more. ex. ‚Äúsorrowin, whats it like sipping that coffee after being on the road so long‚Äù; i love to ask about their dreams - giving players the full reigns to paint a picture of the inside of the characters head is *chefs kiss*. 

i find a lot of the dnd ruleset is focused on combat where 95% of my gameplay is not combat oriented in the slightest. i feel both myself and my players care much more about telling fantastic emotional and hard hitting stories. i also recognize most of that can be achieved just by getting everyone to the table and set a good atmosphere to let them start roleplaying around all willy nilly like, but just curious if anyone has any recommendations. thanks!!!

The weeks grew colder, the air sharper with approaching fall. Leaves began turning gold and red, a slow burn that mirrored the unease growing inside me. The townsfolk stared at me more often than ever. Their eyes were sharp like knives waiting to deliver the killing blow. With the colder weather, colder looks seemed to be descending as well.

At the diner, the usual chatter hushed when I entered. Voices fell silent like a switch had been flipped. The room felt heavier‚Ä¶ oppressive. I walked in and sat at my normal bar stool in the corner. Clara was off today‚Ä¶ in her place was Roy, an older man who knew just about everything about everyone. His grizzled appearance didn‚Äôt mask the fact that he was fairly spry for his age and could flip omelets like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. I never really liked Roy very much, but as time went by, I took any pleasantries I could find, even if they weren‚Äôt meant as such. Roy was wiping out a coffee mug with an old rag, ignoring my presence. I pulled my stool closer to the counter and tried to strike up a conversation with him.

‚ÄúDo you ever... I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ talk with folks here?‚Äù I asked, trying to sound casual.

His eyes bored holes into me, hard and cold.

‚ÄúWe talk. Just not with folks like yourself.‚Äù

I nodded as if I knew what he was talking about.

‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù I responded.

He suddenly stopped cleaning the mug. His eyes clouded over with mystery.

‚ÄúYou need to watch what comes out of your mouth around here, boy.‚Äù He said in a direct tone. ‚ÄúWe have been here a long time now‚Ä¶ and we will always be here. People like you try to come in here and poison what we have. We can‚Äôt have people coming in and ruining our little town. You understand what I‚Äôm telling you, boy?‚Äù

His demeanor completely changed. He was now leaning toward me, one elbow resting against the bar top. I started to feel threatened by his presence, but he had not yet done anything egregious. The silence lasted too long for his liking as he leaned closer toward me.

‚ÄúLet me spell it out for you‚Ä¶ Leave this place and never come back, or you‚Äôll never leave at all.‚Äù He said, staring daggers into my soul.

With that, I had heard and seen enough. I slipped off the bar stool, scrambling to grab my jacket. He leaned back off the bar top and grabbed another mug to clean. As I walked toward the door, I stopped and turned to face him.

‚ÄúThis is my home now, too. I won‚Äôt leave because of some dumb ass tradition‚Ä¶ or whatever it is.‚Äù I said confidently and with more intensity than I intended.

He looked up at me and smiled.

‚ÄúWell then, you‚Äôre dumber than you look, boy.‚Äù He said plainly and continued washing the mugs.

I made my way outside and over to my truck. As I headed back up the hill, I couldn‚Äôt get Roy‚Äôs words out of my mind.

‚ÄúLeave and don‚Äôt come back‚Ä¶ such horseshit‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled as I headed towards the cabin.

Now‚Ä¶ more than ever‚Ä¶ I needed to see her‚Ä¶ I needed to see Clara.

Clara was more distant now. When I asked her about Roy and what he meant by leaving, she brushed me off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just tradition,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúNothing to worry about, I promise! People just get worked up because they‚Äôve spent their entire lives here, and the festival is all they have left.‚Äù

I accepted her response‚Ä¶ because it came from her‚Ä¶ but I did notice some odd behavior from her that I had not seen before. Her hands shook, and her eyes darted nervously when she thought I wasn‚Äôt looking. I was so confused as to why this was all happening, and now Clara was starting to act strangely as well. I had to do something before I went insane.

The next day, I made a plan that I really didn‚Äôt want to follow through with. The plan was for me not to talk to Clara for a full day. I didn‚Äôt want to make her suspicious‚Ä¶ so after the day of not talking, I would sneak down to the diner and wait. Once she got off her shift, I would follow her and see where she went. I had never been to Clara‚Äôs house or even known where she lived, for that matter. She had never invited me over, and I never really asked about it either. I was going to find out what was going on one way or the other.

The next evening, I put my plan in motion. I stonewalled her the entire day. She texted me a few times, but I resisted the urge to respond. She eventually stopped trying. The plan was going exactly as I wanted. I made my way down the hill toward town and parked next to a snow fence just before you round the curve onto the asphalt road. I walked from there over to Harlan‚Äôs to wait for Clara‚Äôs shift to end. I followed her as she left the diner. I put my hood up, staying just far enough behind to not arouse suspicion. She moved with a strange purpose, slipping into the forest shadows... creeping and skulking through town. I kept following at a distance as she entered the forest at the edge of town. The deeper into the woods I followed, the thicker the silence grew. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, their branches clawing at the dark sky. She rounded a turn in the path, and I lost her for a moment. I picked up my speed, just enough to catch up before she got too far. I rounded the curve, and there she was. She stood in a clearing surrounded by gnarled trees, a ring of scorched stones surrounding it.

In the center of the circle, a blackened fire pit still smoldered. Around it, ashes and what looked like bits of old bone lay scattered. Once I recognized what I was seeing, I crouched quickly, clamoring behind a tree. I couldn‚Äôt see Clara anymore. The air was getting colder and darker. My heart was hammering in my chest‚Ä¶ breath catching. What was I looking at? As the question entered my mind, the coppery scent of blood hung thick in the breeze. Low, rhythmic chanting emanated from the trees around the circle. The chants started to rise like the ocean tide, growing louder and deeper with each line. A cold shiver crawled down my spine.

I peeked from behind the tree and saw them. A group of townsfolk standing in the circle‚Ä¶ eyes glazed‚Ä¶ faces expressionless. They were all wearing black robes‚Ä¶ All except for one. Clara was there; her head bowed in prayer. She was wearing a white dress that extended down past her feet. She had stripped her work uniform off and had donned this beautiful silk gown that fluttered in the chilled wind. I scanned the group and saw Tom, standing stiff and silent. The firelight flickered on faces‚Ä¶ old and young‚Ä¶ men and women alike. Gene‚Ä¶ Jimmy‚Ä¶ everyone in town was here. They chanted in a language I didn‚Äôt understand, as a group of hooded figures made their way towards the center.

Suddenly, the chanting stopped. Silence swallowed the clearing. In my horror, I had leaned too far out from behind my only cover and had been exposed. Tom saw me. His eyes turned sharply, locking onto mine. He shook his head side to side subtly, never breaking eye contact. I knew exactly what he meant‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt interfere‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt be seen‚Ä¶ I crouched behind the tree slowly and watched as the ceremony continued. Clara raised her arms toward the sky and screamed. The sound pierced the trembling night. It was oppressively loud. I covered my ears, fearing my eardrums would burst from the intense yell. The others joined in with her in unison. The fire swelled with intensity as the pitch heightened. The crescendo from the eerie band was met with a massive ball of flame that rolled from the pit and into the night sky.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I said under my breath.

I stumbled backward, heart in my throat‚Ä¶ I had to get out of here. I turned and ran away from the screams and into the night. It had gotten so dark, and the trees covered so much canopy that I could not see my hand in front of my face. I ran, hitting tree after tree and limb after limb. I could no longer hear the screams as I emerged from the forest and back onto the road. My heart was pounding in my chest. Sweat was pouring down my forehead and collecting on my shirt as it dripped.

‚ÄúFuck! What was that shit!?‚Äù I asked myself, panting uncontrollably.

I gathered myself and made my way back toward Harlan‚Äôs and hopefully back to my truck. As I passed by the diner, all the lights were off. There didn‚Äôt seem to be anybody inside or in the parking lot. I slowly crept my way past the diner, sticking to the shadows of the other buildings. I made my way past the grocery store and then the general store‚Ä¶ both dark and lifeless.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm home free if I can just get around this corner,‚Äù I muttered, trying to give myself the courage to make it back.

I made it to the next turn and hid in the shadow of the print shop. Around the corner would be the covered bridge and the snow fence where I left the bronco. I leaned against the cold concrete, gathering the courage for the final push. I took a deep breath and rounded the corner. As I made my move, I was met with what felt like a brick wall. I was knocked off my feet and fell straight to the ground. With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I scrambled to get up as quickly as possible. I felt a heavy boot come down against my chest, forcing me to the ground. As I struggled against the immense weight, a calm, raspy voice rattled its way into my ears:

‚ÄúStay down a moment, son... catch your breath.‚Äù

I panicked. Feeling a person‚Äôs boot pushing against my chest infuriated me.

‚ÄúGet the fuck off me! Let me go!‚Äù I yelled through gritted teeth, fighting the unknown figure.

The voice crackled out from the darkness above me once more,

‚ÄúRelax, Elias‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs me‚Ä¶ Tom!‚Äù

‚ÄúTom? What the fuck! Why are you doing this to me?‚Äù I exclaimed in return.

‚ÄúJust relax and I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù He said calmly.

It took me a solid minute or two of struggling against Tom‚Äôs weight before the adrenaline subsided and I was able to quell my racing mind. I let my arms fall limply to the concrete. I was hyperventilating, and the adrenaline dump made me feel extremely dizzy.

‚ÄúYou ok now, son? Are you ready to stand up?‚Äù Tom asked.

I couldn‚Äôt mutter any words through my intense breathing, but I was able to nod twice, giving him the answer he needed. He took his boot off my chest and grabbed my wrist. With what seemed like hardly any effort, he pulled me to my feet.

‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù He muttered.

I was in such shock and disarray that I didn‚Äôt know what the hell was even happening anymore. All I knew was that I had seen something that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see, and now I‚Äôm sure they wanted me dead. With no other option, I followed Tom into the darkness.

He led me back to his cabin, lit by a single lamp swinging on its chain. He hurriedly climbed the stairs and started unlocking his door. I stopped just short of the stairs, looking at the now illuminated black robe that he was wearing. I had been thrown back to that moment‚Ä¶ when he locked eyes with me. Why would he help me if he were a part of all this? Is he going to turn me over to them? These were the thoughts running through my head as he opened the door and turned to look at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doin‚Äô? Don‚Äôt just stand there. Get your ass inside‚Ä¶ now!‚Äù

I hesitated for a moment and then proceeded to follow him inside his cabin.

Once inside, Tom started to disrobe. He was pulling at the waist strap as he pointed at a chair by the fireplace.

‚ÄúSit down over there. We‚Äôve got a lot to discuss.‚Äù He said sternly.

As he disappeared into the darker side of the cabin, I walked over to the fireplace and sat down. A few moments later, Tom returned without the black robe. Ironically, he had changed into the exact opposite‚Ä¶ a cream-colored sweater and blue jeans. My eyes never left him as he meandered over to the pile of logs next to the fire. He picked up a few in his arms and turned his head to look at me.

‚ÄúI bet your head is all kinds of crazy right now, ain‚Äôt it?‚Äù He said with a hint of sarcasm.

He began stacking the wood and lighting it, producing a warm flame that lit the entire room. I stayed silent, hoping that he would get the hint that I did not even remotely trust him anymore. He was going to have to explain himself in detail before I would believe a word he said. He sat down in a chair next to mine, studying the flames with his eyes.

‚ÄúYou want a drink?‚Äù He asked.

I remained silent, my mind still reeling from what I had just endured. He stood up, grabbed a couple of glasses from the table, and a decanter full of whiskey. He poured both glasses half full and then offered one to me.

‚ÄúHere ya go.‚Äù He set the glass down on the table in front of me and took a sip of his own.

I do tons of research but sometimes when I am done I like to draw up a list of questions to ask locals. 

No need to answer all, there may be just one question in particular for which you have a super strong opinion.

My husband and I don't like having  firm itineraries, and most of our travels revolve around food and lots of walking. We will be in Germany/CR/Austria/France for a month so while we're in Hamburg we're really looking to explore what's special and unique to the city and more broadly northern Germany, especially because neither of us has been to the region. My parents will also be with us and have never visited Europe, so they are pretty much just following our lead.

Any and all feedback/advice welcome!

1. We're big time coffee drinkers and I am sooooo excited that Hamburg seems to have a pretty robust coffee community/culture. Would love thoughts on who pulls the best shots (we drink just straight espresso) or sources interesting roasts. Black Delight, Playground, Omen, Blanco & Stockholm CR are currently top of list.
2. Who is nailing a more modern and hyper-local approach to northern German cuisine? We were thinking H√¶bel would be a perfect fit. We're with my parents who don't do as much fine dining as us so we don't want anything in the \*\*/\*\*\* Michelin range, but a more casual \* could totally work.
3. Related to the above, where should we go for lunches/dinners that capture the essence of Hamburg? I think I for sure am interested in Oberhafen-Kantine, Veddeler Fischgastst√§tte, Br√ºcke 10 and am thinking of Old Commercial Room, Th√§mer's, Hatari Pf√§lzer Stube, Anno 1905, Das Dorf for dinner options.
4. We don't do a lot of touristy stuff in general but love to walk a city and explore. I am always looking for the best neighborhoods for walking/shopping/drinks/coffee/etc. After my research I'm looking into Schanzenviertel/Karolinenviertel, Ottensen and Eppendorfer Baum but would love any other recommendations on favorite areas to wander.
5. If you had to recommend ONE beautiful building or structure to check out in the city, what would it be (we're staying in the Speicherstadt).
6. I do think we will hit up the Museum of Art & Industry, what would be a recommended itinerary for this day? Was thinking we might do the museum in the morning and then just walk back to the hotel through the Altstadt neighborhood, anything else in that general area to check out?
7. We don't really want to do a boat tour or anything like that, but I have read that ferry 62 is a nice option for seeing the city?
8. My dad is a huge Beatles fan (he's a Boomer üòÇ) and of course wants to visit the Reeperbahn. I mostly have bars marked in this area but would love some tips on when to visit or anything a Beatles nerd might love that's not in the typical tourist circuit? Should I avoid the area during the weekend?
9. For a city with so much water, what is the best walk along a waterfront (in the fall especially)?
10. Favorite places for drinking? More specifically - who is doing the best inventive cocktails, where are the oldest must-see dives/pubs (or the German equivalent) and best places for beer (good local brewers).

The townsfolk stared at me more often than ever. Their eyes were sharp like knives waiting to deliver the killing blow. With the colder weather, colder looks seemed to be descending as well.

At the diner, the usual chatter hushed when I entered. Voices fell silent like a switch had been flipped. The room felt heavier‚Ä¶ oppressive. I walked in and sat at my normal bar stool in the corner. Clara was off today‚Ä¶ in her place was Roy, an older man who knew just about everything about everyone. His grizzled appearance didn‚Äôt mask the fact that he was fairly spry for his age and could flip omelets like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. I never really liked Roy very much, but as time went by, I took any pleasantries I could find, even if they weren‚Äôt meant as such. Roy was wiping out a coffee mug with an old rag, ignoring my presence. I pulled my stool closer to the counter and tried to strike up a conversation with him.

‚ÄúDo you ever... I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ talk with folks here?‚Äù I asked, trying to sound casual.

His eyes bored holes into me, hard and cold.

‚ÄúWe talk. Just not with folks like yourself.‚Äù

I nodded as if I knew what he was talking about.

‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù I responded.

He suddenly stopped cleaning the mug. His eyes clouded over with mystery.

‚ÄúYou need to watch what comes out of your mouth around here, boy.‚Äù He said in a direct tone. ‚ÄúWe have been here a long time now‚Ä¶ and we will always be here. People like you try to come in here and poison what we have. We can‚Äôt have people coming in and ruining our little town. You understand what I‚Äôm telling you, boy?‚Äù

His demeanor completely changed. He was now leaning toward me, one elbow resting against the bar top. I started to feel threatened by his presence, but he had not yet done anything egregious. The silence lasted too long for his liking as he leaned closer toward me.

‚ÄúLet me spell it out for you‚Ä¶ Leave this place and never come back, or you‚Äôll never leave at all.‚Äù He said, staring daggers into my soul.

With that, I had heard and seen enough. I slipped off the bar stool, scrambling to grab my jacket. He leaned back off the bar top and grabbed another mug to clean. As I walked toward the door, I stopped and turned to face him.

‚ÄúThis is my home now, too. I won‚Äôt leave because of some dumb ass tradition‚Ä¶ or whatever it is.‚Äù I said confidently and with more intensity than I intended.

He looked up at me and smiled.

‚ÄúWell then, you‚Äôre dumber than you look, boy.‚Äù He said plainly and continued washing the mugs.

I made my way outside and over to my truck. As I headed back up the hill, I couldn‚Äôt get Roy‚Äôs words out of my mind.

‚ÄúLeave and don‚Äôt come back‚Ä¶ such horseshit‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled as I headed towards the cabin.

Now‚Ä¶ more than ever‚Ä¶ I needed to see her‚Ä¶ I needed to see Clara.

Clara was more distant now. When I asked her about Roy and what he meant by leaving, she brushed me off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just tradition,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúNothing to worry about, I promise! People just get worked up because they‚Äôve spent their entire lives here, and the festival is all they have left.‚Äù

I accepted her response‚Ä¶ because it came from her‚Ä¶ but I did notice some odd behavior from her that I had not seen before. Her hands shook, and her eyes darted nervously when she thought I wasn‚Äôt looking. I was so confused as to why this was all happening, and now Clara was starting to act strangely as well. I had to do something before I went insane.

The next day, I made a plan that I really didn‚Äôt want to follow through with. The plan was for me not to talk to Clara for a full day. I didn‚Äôt want to make her suspicious‚Ä¶ so after the day of not talking, I would sneak down to the diner and wait. Once she got off her shift, I would follow her and see where she went. I had never been to Clara‚Äôs house or even known where she lived, for that matter. She had never invited me over, and I never really asked about it either. I was going to find out what was going on one way or the other.

The next evening, I put my plan in motion. I stonewalled her the entire day. She texted me a few times, but I resisted the urge to respond. She eventually stopped trying. The plan was going exactly as I wanted. I made my way down the hill toward town and parked next to a snow fence just before you round the curve onto the asphalt road. I walked from there over to Harlan‚Äôs to wait for Clara‚Äôs shift to end. I followed her as she left the diner. I put my hood up, staying just far enough behind to not arouse suspicion. She moved with a strange purpose, slipping into the forest shadows... creeping and skulking through town. I kept following at a distance as she entered the forest at the edge of town. The deeper into the woods I followed, the thicker the silence grew. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, their branches clawing at the dark sky. She rounded a turn in the path, and I lost her for a moment. I picked up my speed, just enough to catch up before she got too far. I rounded the curve, and there she was. She stood in a clearing surrounded by gnarled trees, a ring of scorched stones surrounding it.

In the center of the circle, a blackened fire pit still smoldered. Around it, ashes and what looked like bits of old bone lay scattered. Once I recognized what I was seeing, I crouched quickly, clamoring behind a tree. I couldn‚Äôt see Clara anymore. The air was getting colder and darker. My heart was hammering in my chest‚Ä¶ breath catching. What was I looking at? As the question entered my mind, the coppery scent of blood hung thick in the breeze. Low, rhythmic chanting emanated from the trees around the circle. The chants started to rise like the ocean tide, growing louder and deeper with each line. A cold shiver crawled down my spine.

I peeked from behind the tree and saw them. A group of townsfolk standing in the circle‚Ä¶ eyes glazed‚Ä¶ faces expressionless. They were all wearing black robes‚Ä¶ All except for one. Clara was there; her head bowed in prayer. She was wearing a white dress that extended down past her feet. She had stripped her work uniform off and had donned this beautiful silk gown that fluttered in the chilled wind. I scanned the group and saw Tom, standing stiff and silent. The firelight flickered on faces‚Ä¶ old and young‚Ä¶ men and women alike. Gene‚Ä¶ Jimmy‚Ä¶ everyone in town was here. They chanted in a language I didn‚Äôt understand, as a group of hooded figures made their way towards the center.

Suddenly, the chanting stopped. Silence swallowed the clearing. In my horror, I had leaned too far out from behind my only cover and had been exposed. Tom saw me. His eyes turned sharply, locking onto mine. He shook his head side to side subtly, never breaking eye contact. I knew exactly what he meant‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt interfere‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt be seen‚Ä¶ I crouched behind the tree slowly and watched as the ceremony continued. Clara raised her arms toward the sky and screamed. The sound pierced the trembling night. It was oppressively loud. I covered my ears, fearing my eardrums would burst from the intense yell. The others joined in with her in unison. The fire swelled with intensity as the pitch heightened. The crescendo from the eerie band was met with a massive ball of flame that rolled from the pit and into the night sky.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I said under my breath.

I stumbled backward, heart in my throat‚Ä¶ I had to get out of here. I turned and ran away from the screams and into the night. It had gotten so dark, and the trees covered so much canopy that I could not see my hand in front of my face. I ran, hitting tree after tree and limb after limb. I could no longer hear the screams as I emerged from the forest and back onto the road. My heart was pounding in my chest. Sweat was pouring down my forehead and collecting on my shirt as it dripped.

‚ÄúFuck! What was that shit!?‚Äù I asked myself, panting uncontrollably.

I gathered myself and made my way back toward Harlan‚Äôs and hopefully back to my truck. As I passed by the diner, all the lights were off. There didn‚Äôt seem to be anybody inside or in the parking lot. I slowly crept my way past the diner, sticking to the shadows of the other buildings. I made my way past the grocery store and then the general store‚Ä¶ both dark and lifeless.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm home free if I can just get around this corner,‚Äù I muttered, trying to give myself the courage to make it back.

I made it to the next turn and hid in the shadow of the print shop. Around the corner would be the covered bridge and the snow fence where I left the bronco. I leaned against the cold concrete, gathering the courage for the final push. I took a deep breath and rounded the corner. As I made my move, I was met with what felt like a brick wall. I was knocked off my feet and fell straight to the ground. With adrenaline coursing through my veins, I scrambled to get up as quickly as possible. I felt a heavy boot come down against my chest, forcing me to the ground. As I struggled against the immense weight, a calm, raspy voice rattled its way into my ears:

‚ÄúStay down a moment, son... catch your breath.‚Äù

I panicked. Feeling a person‚Äôs boot pushing against my chest infuriated me.

‚ÄúGet the fuck off me! Let me go!‚Äù I yelled through gritted teeth, fighting the unknown figure.

The voice crackled out from the darkness above me once more,

‚ÄúRelax, Elias‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs me‚Ä¶ Tom!‚Äù

‚ÄúTom? What the fuck! Why are you doing this to me?‚Äù I exclaimed in return.

‚ÄúJust relax and I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù He said calmly.

It took me a solid minute or two of struggling against Tom‚Äôs weight before the adrenaline subsided and I was able to quell my racing mind. I let my arms fall limply to the concrete. I was hyperventilating, and the adrenaline dump made me feel extremely dizzy.

‚ÄúYou ok now, son? Are you ready to stand up?‚Äù Tom asked.

I couldn‚Äôt mutter any words through my intense breathing, but I was able to nod twice, giving him the answer he needed. He took his boot off my chest and grabbed my wrist. With what seemed like hardly any effort, he pulled me to my feet.

‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù He muttered.

I was in such shock and disarray that I didn‚Äôt know what the hell was even happening anymore. All I knew was that I had seen something that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see, and now I‚Äôm sure they wanted me dead. With no other option, I followed Tom into the darkness.

He led me back to his cabin, lit by a single lamp swinging on its chain. He hurriedly climbed the stairs and started unlocking his door. I stopped just short of the stairs, looking at the now illuminated black robe that he was wearing. I had been thrown back to that moment‚Ä¶ when he locked eyes with me. Why would he help me if he were a part of all this? Is he going to turn me over to them? These were the thoughts running through my head as he opened the door and turned to look at me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doin‚Äô? Don‚Äôt just stand there. Get your ass inside‚Ä¶ now!‚Äù

I hesitated for a moment and then proceeded to follow him inside his cabin.

Once inside, Tom started to disrobe. He was pulling at the waist strap as he pointed at a chair by the fireplace.

‚ÄúSit down over there. We‚Äôve got a lot to discuss.‚Äù He said sternly.

As he disappeared into the darker side of the cabin, I walked over to the fireplace and sat down. A few moments later, Tom returned without the black robe. Ironically, he had changed into the exact opposite‚Ä¶ a cream-colored sweater and blue jeans. My eyes never left him as he meandered over to the pile of logs next to the fire. He picked up a few in his arms and turned his head to look at me.

‚ÄúI bet your head is all kinds of crazy right now, ain‚Äôt it?‚Äù He said with a hint of sarcasm.

He began stacking the wood and lighting it, producing a warm flame that lit the entire room. I stayed silent, hoping that he would get the hint that I did not even remotely trust him anymore. He was going to have to explain himself in detail before I would believe a word he said. He sat down in a chair next to mine, studying the flames with his eyes.

‚ÄúYou want a drink?‚Äù He asked.

I remained silent, my mind still reeling from what I had just endured. He stood up, grabbed a couple of glasses from the table, and a decanter full of whiskey. He poured both glasses half full and then offered one to me.

‚ÄúHere ya go.‚Äù He set the glass down on the table in front of me and took a sip of his own.

The silence lingered in the air for a moment or two‚Ä¶ the crackling fire filling the void between us. He finally spoke, cutting the silence like a knife.

‚ÄúThis town...‚Äù he began, voice low, ‚Äúit survives on a ritual‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused for a moment and then continued.

¬†‚ÄúEvery fall, at the harvest, they offer a sacrifice... To keep the people‚Ä¶ young and healthy.‚Äù

I stared at him, maintaining my silent demeanor.

‚ÄúYa see, the funny thing about this sacrificial business is that it‚Äôs gotten harder to perform over the years. The early years were easy, and nobody batted an eye. But now‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just a lot harder than it used to be.‚Äù He took another swallow of whiskey.

I could see that the man was being sincere with his words. He was telling me the truth. Though all my being told me not to, I spoke up.

‚ÄúWho... who do they sacrifice?‚Äù I asked.

Tom‚Äôs gaze didn‚Äôt waver.

‚ÄúOutsiders... Every year, they pick someone not from here. Someone who doesn‚Äôt belong‚Ä¶ someone who blows into town on a whim. Years ago, before all this technology, it was easy to make one person disappear‚Ä¶ Nobody noticed.‚Äù

The room seemed to close in on us both.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked, voice barely above a whisper.

‚ÄúBecause if they don‚Äôt, the town‚Ä¶ turns. The people become somethin‚Äô else‚Ä¶ somethin‚Äô angry‚Ä¶ savage.‚Äù He took a drink and continued, ‚ÄúAnd then‚Ä¶ if they don‚Äôt get it done by the end of the winter‚Ä¶ they all die‚Ä¶ includin‚Äô me.‚Äù

The weight of the words poured from his lips like molasses. A cold sweat broke out over me as I began to understand the reason why the people had acted that way toward me.

‚ÄúYou mean... I‚Äôm next?‚Äù

He nodded grimly, staring into the fire as if searching for comfort.

‚ÄúAfraid so, son‚Ä¶ I must admit, I don't enjoy this type of thing, though‚Ä¶ When I came back from ‚ÄòNam, I was a different man‚Ä¶ hell‚Ä¶ I was a different person altogether. I had seen things that would make Friday the 13^(th) look like a puppet show.‚Äù

I looked at the floor, watching the fire‚Äôs light dance across the beams.

‚ÄúWell... If I‚Äôm next, then why haven‚Äôt you killed me yet?‚Äù I asked plainly.

Tom smirked and blew air out of his nose in a slight chuckle.

‚ÄúElias, I could‚Äôve killed you the day I met you. I could‚Äôve killed you on the pavement earlier with my bare hands‚Ä¶ did you ever stop to think that maybe I don‚Äôt want to kill you?‚Äù he asked, staring directly into my eyes.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ No, I guess not.‚Äù I responded half-heartedly.

Tom picked up his glass and downed the rest of his whiskey before standing and walking over to me. I flinched a bit as his imposing presence stood over me. He put his hand on my shoulder and spoke with a solemn tone that I‚Äôd never heard from him before.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, Elias‚Ä¶ tired of livin‚Äô‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs nothin‚Äô but problems and attitudes nowadays‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve died over there in that jungle‚Ä¶ in that hell‚Ä¶‚Äù his eyes seemed to drift as if he could see something in the air that I could not. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm ready to hang it up, son‚Ä¶ and I need your help to do that.‚Äù

With that, he patted my shoulder and began walking away toward the back of his cabin.

‚ÄúBlankets are on the couch. You'd best get some sleep. We have a big day tomorrow.‚Äù Tom remarked as he disappeared into the dark.

I sat alone, pondering everything. The cabin‚Ä¶ Harlan‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Clara‚Ä¶ everything‚Ä¶ was it all just a setup? Was any of it true at all?

The woods outside seemed darker now, alive with a hunger I could no longer ignore. Indigo Falls was a town built on blood to fulfill their needs. This year, I was their prize.",1,1749320823.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I can sometimes (rarely) start a discussion but I never try to get details it's so hard.

Sometimes I've gotten contacts and while I know it's a numbers game it hasn't worked.

I can't ask out women unless I know them somewhat and everyone around me acts like it's my fault and if I keep doing it I will never be satisfied with my partner.

I am a somewhat social person, definitely more than average however I just dunno.

Kids ‚Äì this is why you need to be especially diligent about voting in your local elections.  Your city council can affect your life way more directly than who is president.  In our most recent by-election, only about 5000 people voted out of 30,000 eligible voters ‚Äì and you all know who those 5000 were.  
 
**The Background** 
For the last 2 years I've been trying to build a moderately sized, moderately affordable purpose built rental building in my town, which has a vacancy rate between 0.5% and 1.5% (for reference, 5% vacancy is balanced, below 3% is concerning and below 1% is an outright crisis).    

I had bought an acre of land zoned for apartment buildings, surrounded on 3 sides by 4 storey apartment buildings that were all built in the 70's under a federal government affordable housing program that got cancelled in the 80's.  The units in those buildings are rent controlled, occupied by older, long term tenants, never turn over until someone dies, and our research indicates rents are between $650 and $1000/month (by comparison, market rates are $1800-2000/month for new builds).  
 
Thankfully, a few years ago, the government brought in a program that effectively subsidizes interest rates for builders of multi-family rental housing IF they meet energy efficiency, accessibility and affordability criteria.
 
My project meets all three, with 20% of the units secured at below market rents for the life of the building, specifically, the rental rates will never exceed 30% of the gross income of someone working full time at minimum wage.  Without getting into the details, I lose a small amount each month on these units but make money on the other 80%, and there are some tax breaks that help with cash-flow in the first few years when the mortgage is highest and rents are lowest.  The government effectively ""co-signs"" my mortgage so I get the lowest possible interest rate which offsets the cost of the money-losing units, and doesn't cost the government any actual cash.  I pay a small insurance premium to the government to protect against default.
 
 
**The Problem**

To build this, I need city council to approve some minor variances, which means a vote at a council meeting, which means public input.  The general public has the right to sign up to speak for up to 3 minutes in support or against any proposal.  If you've watched the tv show Parks & Rec, you might have some idea of what's coming.  
 
This seemed pretty straight forward ‚Äì a nice, new building fitting in with the neighbourhood, replacing a dilapidated, vacant and asbestos riddled 1960's rancher.  With some affordable rents, zero greenhouse gas emissions, EV charging, electric bike charging, outdoor garden plots, zero displacement, sounds pretty good right?  
 
Who could possibly be against something like that?  
  
**The Opposition**  

17 people signed up to speak.  Every one of them over 60, every one of them from the neighbouring rental buildings, every one of them enjoying below market rent due to rent control and having lived there for decades.  They have theirs, fuck everyone else!  
 
Speaker number one was concerned about the affordable housing component and potential poor people moving into the neighbourhood.   

‚ÄúHow do we know you won't be renting to druggies?‚Äù    
‚ÄúIs this for all those people living in tents on the side of the highway?  We don't want them next door to us!‚Äù      

Well Moira, we will still screen tenants and income test to make sure the units go to people who make between $35,000 and $50,000/yr.  Oh, and the affordable rents are actually more than what YOU pay since your rent hasn't gone up since about 1996.  

Speaker number two brought a diagram proving that 50 new rental units in a town with a housing crisis will actually RAISE rents, not lower them (like those damned economists claim.)   
 
He showed us how adding the new, market rents to the existing below market rents and dividing by the number of units means the AVERAGE rent goes up!  Kindof like how a Mercedes dealership opening up in your town will increase the average price of a new car.  Or like how giving soldiers helmets in WW1 increased the number of head injuries.    

My project has managed to unite the people who think our rents are too low, AND the people who think our rents are too high.
 
Speakers 3 through 10 all were angry about the 18 months of construction ruining their peace and quiet.  They like to have coffee in the morning and listen to the birds and wind blowing in the grass of the vacant lot next door.  Once that lot has a building on it, what will happen to the birds?    

We are retaining the two big conifer trees and even modified the site plan to build around them, plus we are adding two dozen native species of trees to the lot which previously contained mostly stinging nettles and swamp grass and bred mosquitos, but none of the speakers had read the submissions they were complaining about.  
  
One of the subsequent speakers wasn't opposed to the project per se, but instead of directing his comments to council, he stood backwards at the podium facing me and told me that thought he should have first refusal of the new units, at the current rent he is paying, and that seniors in should have priority for any new housing since his unit didn't have a dishwasher and he wanted a dishwasher.  He also wanted a 2 bedroom, as he currently lives (alone) in a two bedroom and likes the extra space. 
 
The last speaker was notable because she made her way up to the podium using a walker ‚Äì which was odd, because I know her from my work on site, and the previous times I'd seen her storming up to the fence yelling about the noise, she didn't use a walker and seemed exceptionally sprightly.  
  
She also didn't like the idea of low income people moving into her neighbourhood (I'm guessing her own rent was about $800/month but maybe she's a frugal millionaire), but she would tolerate it if we let her use the garden beds we proposed for our future tenants.    
 
**The Result**  

After over 45 excruciating minutes, my jaw aching from biting my tongue, it went to a vote.  The vote went straight along generational lines with the 3 grey-hairs voting against, and the 3 Millennial councillors and our rock star Gen Z mayor voting for.  Council had to call an impromptu 5 minute recess because as soon as the gavel fell on the vote, the armada of NIMBYs loudly and angrily got up and began shuffling to the door, grumbling about the will of the people being ignored, and requiring everyone else to stand up and make way for them.  
  
**The Future**  

We break ground in 6 weeks and hope to be welcoming residents by spring 2027.  
 
If you guys under 50 don't vote every single time, we have absolutely no chance at fixing the housing crisis because the old generation have proven time and time again they do not care about anyone but themselves.    
Also, may of them are quite literally insane.  If anything Parks & Rec understated the sheer lunacy and idiocy of public comments at council meetings.",118,1749320546.0,BoomersBeingFools,15,1.0,False

Another thing is it's a luxury. Unlike Gay men na mas marami sila, Sapphics are fewer in number. aminin na natin saka we would rather spend our money on something more important, lalo na't tumataas ang cost of living ngayon.

Kayo, ano sa tingin niyo po? Dahil, I'm planning to do something for Sapphics but I will never tell it yet. Kaya I need your suggestions or feedbacks kung bakit nagsasara ang mga lesbian bars.

Kaya siguro investors and production companies are hesitant to invest in everything Sapphic (movies, series and businesses) dahil malulugi lang sila. Ang tanong lugi ba talaga or is it just that we're fewer in numbers tapos magkakaiba pa ang interests?

Yeah, that was me. The worst part wasn't even the low views. It was knowing that my ideas were trapped behind a wall of my own shitty design skills.

My first instinct as a programmer was 'I can automate this.' I tried to script something with some image library to overlay text on screenshots. The result? A complete disaster. It looked rigid, ugly, and took me hours of debugging just to produce something worse than what I could do by hand.

So I tried Canva. Spent an hour trying to cut my face out of a screenshot, only to end up with a jagged mess that looked like I'd done it with safety scissors. Then I'd slap on some glowing text with a thick black outline, thinking it looked 'eye-catching'. In reality, it looked like a flyer for a shitty local nightclub.

And the B-roll.. jesus. My videos were basically a highlight reel of Pexels' greatest hits. If I needed a shot of someone working, you bet your ass it was that same overhead shot of hands typing on a MacBook. It was embarrassing.

Seeing my video with its garbage-ass thumbnail sitting next to a pro's in the search results was a special kind of hell. It screamed 'amateur hour' and I knew it was killing my video before anyone even clicked.

So, back to the Google trenches I went, this time typing ""how to make videos look good when you suck at design"" and ""b-roll that isn't hands on a laptop.""

I went down the generative tools rabbit hole. Midjourney was the big one everyone talked about, but the prompt engineering felt like trying to cast a magic spell. I get code, not voodoo. Trying to describe an image in that specific, arcane way just to get a decent result was a massive time sink.

Lately, I've been messing with ChatGPT's image generation, and the crazy part is how context-aware it is. You can literally tell it ""create a thumbnail for a video titled 'Eating bananas with my friend Billy"" and it actually understands the concept and can even add the text properly. But here's the trade-off.. there's a real risk of your stuff looking like generic AI slop. And some viewers will call you out on it in a heartbeat, calling it lazy or soulless. Like what happened with the ghibli trend. You can't just take the first thing it spits out; you still have to put in the work to make it your own. It's a tool, not a magic 'make me a viral thumbnail' button.

Then, after hours of clicking around, I stumbled onto one of those all-in-one creative suites. I think it was Freepik, they've apparently bundled a ton of different tools together now. The game changer wasn't one specific tool, but the fact that they put all this powerful tech from places like Google (with their Veo model), Runway, and others behind a simple interface. It felt like finding a well-documented API for creativity.

Suddenly, I could just type ""cinematic shot of a lonely robot drinking coffee in a neon-lit alley"" and get something usable back. Not a six-fingered monstrosity. I started generating unique backgrounds, assets for my videos, and even ideas for thumbnails that didn't look like they were made in 1998.

This led me to another thought.. how do I even know what a ""good"" thumbnail looks like? I started using a YouTube transcript extension again, I think it's called DupDub. Not to read the transcripts, but to quickly scrub through tutorials from big creators on ""thumbnail theory"" or ""video editing tricks"" and find the exact moment they show visual examples. Saved me from watching hours of fluff just to see a 5-second clip of what works.

Look, my workflow is still a chaotic mess, but here's the stuff that's helping me bridge the gap between having good ideas and making them look like they're not from a forgotten Geocities page.

I'm still using Canva for the final assembly of thumbnails, but now I'm feeding it unique images generated from some of these newer suites. It's a hell of a combo.. for video, some of these platforms are even starting to roll out text to video generation, which is insane to think about for future B-roll.

For editing, I'm sticking with CapCut on desktop. It's free and it's fast. I value efficiency over having a million features I'll never use.

And yeah, a clean audio foundation is still key. A solid noise canceling app like Krisp (or NVIDIA Broadcast if you have the right card) makes the whole video feel more premium by just killing all the background crap before it even hits the recording. Some people even use text to speech from places like ElevenLabs to get that ""perfect"" narration, but that's a whole other rabbit hole.

The point is, the game has changed. A few years ago, if you weren't a graphic designer or a videographer, you were screwed. Your stuff was just going to look amateurish. Now, the tools are finally catching up. They're not perfect, but they're good enough to give a one person army a fighting chance.

As someone who could probably spend a month building a shitty version of one of these tools, I'd rather just use the good ones that already exist and spend my time making better videos.",5,1749320394.0,NewTubers,7,1.0,False

But after seeing a few people talk about **Lulutox detox tea**, I figured it was worth checking out. I‚Äôve been dealing with bloating, stubborn weight around my hips, and low energy for a while, and I was curious if something as simple as tea could help.

I didn‚Äôt expect miracles. I just wanted to feel *a little* better. So here‚Äôs what I found after a full month of drinking **Lulutox tea** daily, with no diet changes and no workouts added. Just one habit, tracked carefully.

**Why Lulutox Tea?**

There are hundreds of detox teas online, and most of them are either overpriced or full of weird ingredients that make you run to the bathroom. So I did my homework on this one. **Lulutox tea** caught my attention for a few reasons:

* It‚Äôs made with **13 plant-based ingredients** (including matcha, oolong tea, dandelion, milk thistle, and yerba mate)
* No artificial junk or aggressive laxatives
* Thousands of people were talking about **Lulutox tea reviews** online, and most looked legit, not copy-paste spam

I figured at the very least, I‚Äôd be drinking a decent herbal tea. If it helped with bloating or energy, even better.

**Week 1: Not much at first, then...**

The first few days? Nothing dramatic. The tea tastes surprisingly light and earthy, and I drank it every morning instead of my usual coffee. Around day 4, I noticed I wasn‚Äôt feeling as puffy in the afternoon, which is usually when my bloating kicks in.

I checked the **Lulutox tea ingredients** again and realized a few of them (like nettle leaf and milk thistle) are known for helping with water retention and gut health.

**Week 2: More energy, less snacking**

By the second week, I started waking up more easily, and without reaching for a second cup of coffee. I didn‚Äôt expect that at all. The energy boost wasn‚Äôt like caffeine-jitters, just more... steady.

Also, I was snacking less. I wasn‚Äôt even trying to, but I realized I felt full longer and didn‚Äôt have that 3pm crash.

**Week 3: Weight shift + better digestion**

I didn‚Äôt weigh myself obsessively, but I did check around day 20 and I was down about 3 pounds. It wasn‚Äôt water weight either, my jeans fit looser and my stomach didn‚Äôt feel bloated anymore, even after meals.

I‚Äôve tried other products that claim to help with digestion and metabolism, but **Lulutox detox tea** was the first that made me feel it without side effects.

**Week 4: The results stuck**

By the end of 30 days, here‚Äôs what I noticed:

* Flatter belly (not abs, but definite change)
* Better morning energy
* Reduced cravings
* Regular, gentle digestion (no discomfort or weird urgency)

And best of all? No crashes, no headaches, no side effects. If you‚Äôre wondering **is Lulutox tea safe**, I‚Äôd say yes based on my experience. It felt more like a wellness boost than a diet trick.

**Side Effects? None here**

I read some concerns online about **Lulutox detox tea side effects**, but I had none. No cramping, no dehydration, no running to the bathroom. Just light herbal tea that worked gradually.

That said, everyone reacts differently. I always say if you‚Äôre on medication or have health conditions, check with your doctor first.

**Where I got it (don‚Äôt skip this)**

I saw a few knockoff versions of Lulutox floating around, but I ordered from the [**official site here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST). They were running a big discount when I ordered, and shipping was quick.

They also sent tips for how to use it (morning or night, I chose morning). If you want to check if the deal is still active, try this [**alternate link**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST). It worked for me.

**Would I use it again?**

Yep. I‚Äôm not someone who sticks with every trend, but **Lulutox tea** was easy, tasty, and actually helped me feel more in control of my body. No promises of dramatic weight loss, just real results over time.

If you‚Äôre curious about **lulutox tea where to buy**, or wondering **does lulutox detox tea work**, this post is for you. I‚Äôll probably keep it in my rotation a few times a week, especially when I feel bloated or sluggish.

Would love to hear from others who‚Äôve tried it, especially if you had a different experience or noticed other benefits.",1,1749320311.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

We recently had a user come to us with a common dilemma: a living room that felt unfinished, particularly a long wall with a TV that needed a bolder statement, and a coffee table that had seen better college days! They were wondering if built-ins were still ""a thing"" and what else they could change, from rugs to furniture, art, or plants. They also mentioned other navy elements in their open-concept home, which was a great starting point for our AI.

Here's how Style Blast AI stepped in to completely transform their space:

**Before:**

**What the AI Did:**

* **Custom Built-ins:** The AI tackled the user's primary concern by designing elegant, floor-to-ceiling built-ins around the TV. These not only provide ample storage and display space but also create a striking focal point, proving that built-ins are definitely still a stylish and functional choice! The deep navy color of the built-ins perfectly complements the existing navy elements in their home, creating a cohesive and sophisticated look.
* **Modern Coffee Table:** The outdated coffee table was replaced with a contemporary round wooden table that perfectly fits the space and offers a more refined aesthetic.
* **Integrated Decor:** The AI seamlessly integrated decorative elements such as plants and art. The artwork above the TV ties into the color scheme, while strategically placed plants add warmth and life to the room.
* **Enhanced Ambiance:** While the original rug was a good starting point, the AI maintained a similar size and color palette to ensure continuity while harmonizing with the new built-ins and overall refreshed look.
* **Subtle Details:** Notice how the AI also considered the smaller details, like the styling of the shelves with books and decorative objects, enhancing the overall appeal.

This transformation showcases how Style Blast AI can take your design challenges and turn them into stunning realities, all while incorporating your personal preferences and existing elements.

1l5rcpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hernia/comments/1l5rcpe/post_umbilical_hernia_repair_with_mesh_operation/,Post Umbilical Hernia Repair with Mesh Operation +8 Days Today,"I am post op +8 days. Umbilical and mesh. Was originally expecting three incisions, ended up with six. 3 on the left, top, bottom, and down the middle on the outside, and one on the inside to close the hernia itself.

That night, very painful, very uncomfortable. I slept (rather rested, very poor sleep quality) at a pretty good incline. I was up every hour to urinate. Make sure you are taking the stool softener, you do not want to let your digestion stack up on you. Pain level is pretty high when trying to move. Will be small steps and you will be stooped over when walking. Recommend chicken broth, pudding, and jellow for food.

Op+1: Next morning, was able to sit comfortably at my desk and work for about seven hours, with breaks. You will be tired and you will benefit from rest. Still stooped over, still walking slowly. I would recommend staying on the lighter side of foods. Scrambled eggs, chicken noodle soups etc. Make sure you are on your stool softener meds- it's not just softening, but it has an ingredient in it that stimulates the bowels. The pain meds are going to dry you out so going to the bathroom is crucial to feeling alive again. Hydrate.

Op +2: I was not able to go to the bathroom that day. Was drinking a lot of water, but this is when I started the stool medication. Huge error on my part. Pain is still there, but you are walking more assuredly. I was still stooped a little bit and my back was doing all of the structural support, so walking/standing was very tiring.

Op +3: I stopped taking the pain meds the previous evening and switched over to Tylenol in the am and before bed only. I wanted to go to the bathroom so I dialed up my Tele-Med and talked to the Dr. She prescribed a magnesium citrate (over the counter) liquid to drink. It emptied me out like whoah. Felt great to be empty. All the pressure was off. Rested pretty good that night. Got some two hour blocks of sleep in. Less frequent urination. Back to my own bed and with some limited time able to sleep on my side. Felt great. First real meal since the day before surgery and had pizza. Insane how good food tastes after not eating for a few days!

Op +4: Just about back to normal. Noticed I was a little emotionally sensitive, pain will do that. Also noticed that the pain had given me hyperacusis or sound-induced pain (noxacusis), which is why I think I was a little irritable. Had carne asada tacos for dinner. Amazing.

Op +5: Today. I feel different. The sensitivity is gone. I feel motivated. Woke up, had my coffee and went to the bathroom like normal! Body clock is back. Drove this am. Standing almost completely upright. Tightness where the mesh is stitched, the main entry incisions are sensitive, but after three Tylenol and breakfast, I feel pretty good.

Op +6: Able to stand longer periods of time before the stinging/burning sets in. 

Op +7: Mowed my back lawn (it is small), fertilized and did some general yard maintenance. Did not take any Tylenol before bed and slept sufficiently okay.

Op +8: Drove to the store and did not notice any of the bumps, dips, and road rumble that had bothered me in past days. Walked through the mall on an errand felt just the slight pings of pain at the suture points, was walking fast (picking up food for a party and was a little behind schedule).

I have my surgeon post op Monday- super happy with my progress and attribute it to getting off of the pain meds ASAP, lots of water, no hard alcohol (just a glass or two of wine) and walking as much as possible.  


Bottom line. You will begin feeling better by the next day and you will notice improvements in mobility and pain management from the morning to the evenings. Stay positive. Stay on top of hydration and get off of the pain meds as soon as possible. They delay your recovery.

Good luck! The hardest step is always the first.",1,1749320071.0,Hernia,6,1.0,False
