1iwx2gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectors/comments/1iwx2gh/should_i_buy_a_projector_in_my_case/,Should I buy a projector in my case?,"Hey! I have a question that I am thinking of for some time now and don't have a clue. Maybe you could give me some advice on that!

When we lived in a flat for few years we watched tv like 2 times a week for 1-2 hours. Now we're living in our house that we moved into a year ago and our watching habits changed a lot. We rarely are watching something on Netflix, maybe once a week or once a two weeks, sometimes once a month even and we do that on MacBook siting on coffee table - so very humble setup :)

Possible new setup:

* BenQ TH671ST short throw
* 110"" rolled screen.

I have this idea of living room not being build around 65 inch black rectangle but we'd like ho have some option to watch sometimes on a bigger screen (for 7-8 years back watch only in the evenings). I have like 200 cm free floor space to the wall where tv could be placed and I thought I could maybe buy a short throw projector like BenQ TH671ST which is from I saw a good quality and a good price (don't want to spend all my money on something I barely would use). I could cast around 110 inch view and display it on a rolled screen hanging in the recessed wall (3,5x2,7 m) that would cover some pictures, paintings or books.

But this idea has few small cons that I identified. There is no real place I could hard mount a projector as:

\- I have 2,7-4,9 m cathedral ceiling with long hanging lamps, vertical mount would need to be around 2,5 meters high to mount a projector to ceiling or 2,5 meters long for horizontal mount to mount it to the wall

\- Electric and audio cable would be visible because there is no way to really hide them on ceiling as I didn't thought about a projector before. Not that this is terrible but better keep them hidden.

So, my idea is, a short throw projector, hidden in the closet and when in use I'd put it on a good tripod. I have a general purpose good quality Sirui Traveler 7C in the house that could do its job. Then I'd just need to take out projector from some closet, put it on stand, level it, hook up with either some chrome cast or MacBook, connect to the outlet and to the stereo speakers (that I am now using for music only), roll down the screen and I'd be good to go for some cinema experience. We'd be sitting around 1,5-2 meters from the projector, 3,3-3,7 meters from the 110 inch screen.

I think doing that like once a week for 1-2 hours or even once every two weeks could be a good compromise not having it mounted constantly where it does not really fits and not having tv on the wall.

Attached a photo and a floor plan where the projector would need to be to cast 110 inch screen. Also please notice screen would not be centered on a wall and bottom of the screen would be 100 cm from the floor as I plan to possibly buy a grand piano in a future that I 102 cm high. But also my closet on this wall is 75 cm height so tv would also hang like 100 cm from the floor.

Yesterday I did a test where I put tripod with the height of 100 cm and it was completely fine for me it wouldn't obstructing anything on the wall so I think that wouldn't be any issue for watching big screen from around 4 meters distance. Also me sitting on the couch put my head on height around 120 cm measuring from the floor. We would watch in the evening but also have external blinds so I wouldn't consider windows any issue.

What do you think guys?

Hi guys. 

So, i really need some advice here it might be long, but i don’t feel like answering that many questions, so theres a fair amount of relevant background info: 

I (f33) have been through a lot these past years and i’ve been through alot of ups and downs regarding men. On top of that, 3 years ago I got sick and during that my confidence took a massive turn for the worse. Im now physically back on track, but still struggle mentally. Im a relatively attractive woman, that looks 10 years younger than i am and have no trouble getting male attention. However, i have never been the one seeking it because im quite shy. 

About 5 years ago i met a man through my work (i work part time in the metal and punk industry in my country as a “hire in” merch girl for a few bands that i know in the scene, through out my country). 
He’s a drummer in a band that i didn’t know at the time. I just saw him and thinking he was fucking beautiful. The night went on and we all had a small afterparty and i got along with him and his band so well that i quickly became a friend of the band and went on tour with them. 

At the time he was 42 and had a girlfriend. 
And honestly he’s one of the greatest guys i’ve ever met. Really caring, warm hearted and openminded on top of being so attractive. 
I developed a bit of a crush on him and what i’ve heard from his band, he had a small crush on me too, but none of us had ever mentioned it. 

He broke it off with his ex last year and i recently got single, too.

A few weeks ago i texted him and was like 
“Hi, im in your city this friday for a concert. Wanna get coffee?” And he told me he was going to the same concert, so we arranged for me to crash at his place and attend the concert together.

All day there was some small flirting back and forth. When we talked he would keep eyecontact and smile whenever i talked. And i blushed a little bit. My face hurt from smiling. 
At the concert he kept looking at two GORGEOUS women. I met them on the toilet and they asked me if he was my boyfriend and i said we were just friends. They told me that he was into me and it was obvious. And honestly i felt bad because i got jealous when he looked at them.. 

The next day on my way home, i sat on the train smiling thinking about the night before. At one point we went through the crowds after getting beers and he held my hand. It felt nice and i felt safe. I wish i would’ve told him in person, but i didn’t feel like i had the courage to tell him about my thought and the feeling of jealousy, so i texted him. He felt the same.. 
he was more like “i just wanna see where it would take us, because im not sure what my feelings are”. He came to my place this friday and we went to hang out with my friends. When we came home he kissed me and one thing led to another and we ended up having sex, but that type of sex where it was intense and passionate. The type of sex you only see in movies. I personally have never tried that before. I have this thing where i laugh during sex when it’s good and.. yeah i laughed and told him why. No deal breaker. He was cool about it! 
I woke up to him holding me close and kissing me. 
He went home because he had to go out with a couple of friends. I ended up not hearing from him for 15 hours. He called me out of the blue and i was really happy. Turned out that he was drunk and ended up going home at 6 in the morning and that he was just asleep. 

He’s playing a big gig this coming up saturday and they hired me as a merch girl a couple of months ago. He lives 4 hours away (we live in a small country, so LD isn’t a problem) and im arriving on friday. So this is kinda a new thing. He knows a lot of people at the gig including his band members who doesn’t know about all of this. I asked him how he expected me to act just in case i started overthinking if he didn’t gave me any attention and he said that he didn’t want us to act any different than we did this weekend. Not even in public. 
He then said that he couldn’t get me out of his head and that he wished he would’ve kissed me more. On top he told me he was confused and overwhelmed because we went from friends to this with a blink of an eye and im now scared we’re moving too fast and i might lose him in the process. We agreed on not having any expectations to this leading into a relationship. We don’t even call it dating. It feels nice not having a plan and just see where it takes us. 

My question is: 
How do i not fuck this up by overthinking? 
Do you have any good advice to keep calm and stay cool based on our story? 

Im pretty sure he likes me too and i feel like, because we’ve known each other for so long, that it’s not even that quick? It feels right. 
But im scared to fall in love with him and him not feeling the same. I kinda hold myself back a bit, in case i would get hurt, and i plan on telling him, but this time in person. We promised to be honest and speak open about our thoughts, but now the obvious is out i feel like i have the courage to tell him face to face. 

So yeah. Give me some advice please, but be nice. Im a sensitive person and this is actually out of my comfort zone.

 

Have a nice day❤️

Then ran the same script in Kitty and noticed it completed in a second, as opposed to possibly hours.

So I made a little function to determine what kind of file is in the active buffer, and if it's a programming language extension it will try to compile and run said file in a new Kitty window! This will ultimately save me a lot of key strokes mucking about between emacs' shells, terminals or external terminals via alt+tab.

  
It's only got support for rust and C with makefiles or just a main file in the absence of a makefile, but the logic is there to be extensible!

  
I have a mild fear that it has already been done, but nonetheless it has been a fun project so far.

  
Let me know if it doesn't work as I'm on macOS while testing this.

**Overview:**

SpotSearch is a location-based app that rewards users for exploring and checking into different places. The app leverages geolocation to encourage users to discover new spots—such as coffee shops, parks, landmarks, or local businesses—and earn rewards just for visiting. You, as the app owner, earn money from ads, while users can make money or earn points by checking in at various locations.

**How it works:**

1. **User Registration:** Users sign up and grant the app access to their location.

2. **Explore & Check-In:** Users can see a map or list of nearby places they can visit and check into (cafes, parks, malls, shops, etc.). Each place has a reward attached (points or money).

3. **Earning Points:** Every time users visit and check in at a location, they earn points. Some locations may offer additional rewards for specific actions, like taking a photo, answering a fun quiz, or posting a review.

4. **Rewards & Redemption:** Points can be redeemed for cash (via PayPal), gift cards, discounts at local businesses, or donated to charities.

5. **Daily & Weekly Challenges:** Users can complete location-based challenges, like visiting 5 different places in a day, or ""spotting"" a specific type of place (e.g., checking into 3 coffee shops). These challenges can reward bonus points.

6. **Leaderboards & Social:** The app can have leaderboards where users compete to visit the most places, with top users winning bigger rewards.

**Monetization for You (App Owner):**

- **Ad Revenue:** 

Display banner or interstitial ads to users as they check in, browse locations, or participate in challenges.

- **Sponsored Locations:** 

Local businesses can sponsor their location to appear with a higher reward or promotion. You can charge them for this visibility and drive traffic to their store.

- **Premium Memberships:** 

Offer a subscription for users to get bonus points, faster rewards, or exclusive locations with high-value rewards.

- **Partnerships:** 

Collaborate with businesses to create exclusive challenges or promotions, where users can earn extra points for visiting certain stores, cafes, or attractions.

**Why it could work:**

- **Encourages Exploration:** 

The app encourages users to discover new places, making it appealing to people who love to explore or travel.

- **Gamification & Social Elements:** 

By adding daily challenges, leaderboards, and social sharing, users will be more engaged and competitive.

- **Wide Appeal:** 

Everyone goes places—whether to work, shop, or socialize—making this app accessible to a wide audience.

- **Local Business Engagement:** 

Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic and visibility, while users earn rewards for visiting them.

With SpotSearch, users can earn rewards just by doing something they already do—going out and exploring different places—while you generate ad revenue from frequent interactions within the app.",1,1740384123.0,app_ideas,0,1.0,False

She has posted videos before of her waking up very, very early to prepare coffee for her husband before he goes to work. And in a lot of her videos, she’s eating hot cheetos, pizza, or take-out. 

I think that her husband has an absolutely horrible way of displaying his concerns for her health and hygiene, and is extremely frustrated with her depressive episodes and lack of effort. She’s posted before about her depression and videos about how she used to look, along with AI pictures of her as a very petite version of herself. It’s clear she has body image issues, and it’s so sad to see her go through this, but I also can see why he would be frustrated. I’m not excusing what he said or did (I think he’s a POS and she should leave him), but I’d be frustrated if I was the sole provider and my partner stayed at home with the child and didn’t make any efforts to take care of themselves, made me run to McDonald’s when I wasn’t working, and posted a lot of sad videos about how miserable they were to be living the life they live. 

She mentioned she gained 100lbs from her depression, but even being 298lbs is not a healthy place to be. She needs loving people in her support group who can pour positivity into her and who are also maybe SAHMs that can go for walks together with their children, and just encourage movement and love.  As someone who has almost ended their life because of their depression, I know getting out of bed and taking care of yourself can be difficult and sometimes impossible. But based off her videos, it seems like she doesn’t have many friends to lean on, and it’s really heart-breaking to see such a sweet soul go through what she’s going through, and have a partner who would spew such poison at the mother of their child. I hope she finds a supportive community of people in real life and not just on the internet, so she can be motivated to focus on her emotional wellbeing and get to a healthy place for her and her daughter. And I hope she finds the strength to leave him, I know that’s not easy. ",1,1740383859.0,InfluencerSnark,0,1.0,False

1iwwtxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1iwwtxf/i_think_i_sometimes_downplay_issues/,I think I sometimes downplay issues.,"This is about my ex-girlfriend from college. I think there are some things which I feel I shouldn't have downplayed, considering the result of it.

One thing, I'm realising now is that how she wouldn't stand me even replying humbly to any other girl. I was the class representatives, so I would get some texts, to which I replied in my natural way(alike to everyone). But she would get upset that I'm talking too nicely to them. 

She wouldn't stand my friendship with any other girl. She would start saying bad things about them, saying ""I know her, I know what kind of girl she is"" and all that. She basically indirectly made me break my friendship with them.

In one case, she was very direct. It was a weekend when she was being busy(although she wasn't doing anything other than routine), so it happened that my other friend's(who was a girl) name came in my frequently contacted list(yeah, she had access to my phone, I had to hers too for that matter) and she put a condition that either I stop talking to that girl or I discontinue (idk what, the relationship Ig) with her. And yeah, ofc I complied.

She had bunch of friends who were guys, she would regularly hangout with them, she had a bestfriend (guy) with whom she would go out to have snacks or coffee. I never(and I think rightfully so) objected or even made any comment to that ever. Except once, when I suggested to her that it's possible he likes her(looking at her bestie's dedication).

And the way she would be when she became angry- Not showing any signs anger, bottling it up all, and stopping to communicate altogether till I had to dig just too much as to what happened. Whenever I would ask her that why does she stops all comunication when she is angry, she used to tell me that she is grown up in that environment, to bottle it up till it subsides automatically in 3-4 days.",1,1740383539.0,rant,0,1.0,False

Even though he’s younger than me, he’s incredibly mature and has never failed to show me how much he love and appreciate me. I actually prayed and manifested for a Man like him and thank God he gave me one.

This weekend, he drove down to see me, so I decided to spoil him and take care of him while he was here. It turned out to be one of the best weekends 🥹 just the two of us staying in, cuddling, snuggling, watching movies. I cooked for him, and he baked cookies for me. Before he left, I made some of his favorite dishes to prepare him for the week, along with a cup of coffee, which he found really sweet.

While I was prepping and cooking our lunch, he kept staring at me with the most adorable look in his eyes and said, “You’re like a superhero chef.” Then, he told me, “No one in my life has ever treated me like this before. I wanna cry.” Hearing that made me want to sob. This man deserves the world. He makes loving him so EASY.

I literally just want to spoil him and give him all the love he deserves. I feel so lucky to be able to do that. Now, as I look back at our videos of us baking together, I can’t help but smile—he’s such a cutie pie. After everything I went through with dating last year, I’m so incredibly grateful to have found such a good man.

1iwwrd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1iwwrd0/help_me_to_not_fuck_this_up/,Help me to not fuck this up..,"Hi guys. 

So, i really need some advice here it might be long, but i don’t feel like answering that many questions, so theres a fair amount of relevant background info: 

I (f33) have been through a lot these past years and i’ve been through alot of ups and downs regarding men. On top of that, 3 years ago I got sick and during that my confidence took a massive turn for the worse. Im now physically back on track, but still struggle mentally. Im a relatively attractive woman, that looks 10 years younger than i am and have no trouble getting male attention. However, i have never been the one seeking it because im quite shy. 

About 5 years ago i met a man through my work (i work part time in the metal and punk industry in my country as a “hire in” merch girl for a few bands that i know in the scene, through out my country). 
He’s a drummer in a band that i didn’t know at the time. I just saw him and thinking he was fucking beautiful. The night went on and we all had a small afterparty and i got along with him and his band so well that i quickly became a friend of the band and went on tour with them. 

At the time he was 42 and had a girlfriend. 
And honestly he’s one of the greatest guys i’ve ever met. Really caring, warm hearted and openminded on top of being so attractive. 
I developed a bit of a crush on him and what i’ve heard from his band, he had a small crush on me too, but none of us had ever mentioned it. 

He broke it off with his ex last year and i recently got single, too.

A few weeks ago i texted him and was like 
“Hi, im in your city this friday for a concert. Wanna get coffee?” And he told me he was going to the same concert, so we arranged for me to crash at his place and attend the concert together.

All day there was some small flirting back and forth. When we talked he would keep eyecontact and smile whenever i talked. And i blushed a little bit. My face hurt from smiling. 
At the concert he kept looking at two GORGEOUS women. I met them on the toilet and they asked me if he was my boyfriend and i said we were just friends. They told me that he was into me and it was obvious. And honestly i felt bad because i got jealous when he looked at them.. 

The next day on my way home, i sat on the train smiling thinking about the night before. At one point we went through the crowds after getting beers and he held my hand. It felt nice and i felt safe. I wish i would’ve told him in person, but i didn’t feel like i had the courage to tell him about my thought and the feeling of jealousy, so i texted him. He felt the same.. 
he was more like “i just wanna see where it would take us, because im not sure what my feelings are”. He came to my place this friday and we went to hang out with my friends. When we came home he kissed me and one thing led to another and we ended up having sex, but that type of sex where it was intense and passionate. The type of sex you only see in movies. I personally have never tried that before. I have this thing where i laugh during sex when it’s good and.. yeah i laughed and told him why. No deal breaker. He was cool about it! 
I woke up to him holding me close and kissing me. 
He went home because he had to go out with a couple of friends. I ended up not hearing from him for 15 hours. He called me out of the blue and i was really happy. Turned out that he was drunk and ended up going home at 6 in the morning and that he was just asleep. 

He’s playing a big gig this coming up saturday and they hired me as a merch girl a couple of months ago. He lives 4 hours away (we live in a small country, so LD isn’t a problem) and im arriving on friday. So this is kinda a new thing. He knows a lot of people at the gig including his band members who doesn’t know about all of this. I asked him how he expected me to act just in case i started overthinking if he didn’t gave me any attention and he said that he didn’t want us to act any different than we did this weekend. Not even in public. 
He then said that he couldn’t get me out of his head and that he wished he would’ve kissed me more. On top he told me he was confused and overwhelmed because we went from friends to this with a blink of an eye and im now scared we’re moving too fast and i might lose him in the process. We agreed on not having any expectations to this leading into a relationship. We don’t even call it dating. It feels nice not having a plan and just see where it takes us. 

My question is: 
How do i not fuck this up by overthinking? 
Do you have any good advice to keep calm and stay cool based on our story? 

Im pretty sure he likes me too and i feel like, because we’ve known each other for so long, that it’s not even that quick? It feels right. 
But im scared to fall in love with him and him not feeling the same. I kinda hold myself back a bit, in case i would get hurt, and i plan on telling him, but this time in person. We promised to be honest and speak open about our thoughts, but now the obvious is out i feel like i have the courage to tell him face to face. 

So yeah. Give me some advice please, but be nice. Im a sensitive person and this is actually out of my comfort zone.

 

Have a nice day❤️

I’m autistic so routines generally scratch an itch for me already. One thing I found frustrating is that all the videos I could find online were mostly done by Americans and the cultural differences were a huge block for me relating - a shirtless run at 5am? As if. Going to a gym that’s actually empty at 6am? If only. I also found a lot of the attitudes to work toxic. 

So I’m curious. Other UK HENRYs, what’s your normal morning routine look like?

Also, are there any gadgets you bought to improve your mornings?

I’ll start on the second one - I bought the Lumie Brazil SAD light and have my coffee next to it every morning. I suffer badly with seasonal depression and annoyingly I’ve found this light therapy really helpful - annoying because the lamp is big and ugly. But yeah that wasn’t crazy expensive (£200) and fitted the bill after I did a bunch of research.

I'm a shift lead for my store and this morning i was scheduled to open the store for inventory. while I was on my way to work my manager text me saying that the only other person coming in at the time called out so i would have to wait for the next person to show up to go into the store due to rule that two people need to be at the store to go in. I texted my manager back just saying ""thanks for the info"". I decided not to just wait in the parking lot wasting gas because I would be using my heater and went to a coffee shop to wait until the next person was in. When I get to work when I was told the next two people were another manager and our newish GM. I go through my shift without a problem until the end. My GM come up to me and tells me I am now suppose to stay later because I didn't work the first hour even though that's out of my control because the other person called out. also he said i wasn't going to get paid for that hour because i didn't work. To my knowledge what my GM said is incorrect. I have been told I would get paid for the first hour and not need to stay an extra hour because I was showing up at the time I was scheduled and its wasting my time just sitting there waiting for the next person. I told him I wasn't going to stay and I should be getting a paid for the first hour. even told him to call the original manager that texted me in the morning. he did and it seem like the original manager told him she believed I am correct so I was able to leave on time and keep my clock in time but going off of how my GM spoke about it, it seemed like no one knows 100% what's correct. 

My question is am I supposed to be paid for that first hour and not expected to stay longer or not?

Ever wonder why you Google “best coffee brand” once, and now every social media app is like, *""Hey, fellow caffeine addict, we got deals for you!""* That’s digital marketing at its finest.

Here’s what we actually do (besides drinking too much coffee):

📌 **SEO** – We fight Google’s algorithm like gladiators, hoping to land on the first page. Because let’s be honest, nobody clicks ""Next Page.""

📌 **PPC Ads** – Imagine paying rent… but to Google and Facebook, so they show your ad instead of your competitor’s.

📌 **Content Marketing** – We write blogs so good that even your grandma would want to read about ""10 Ways to Optimize Your Website.""

📌 **Social Media Marketing** – Where we pretend to be relatable brands and slide into your feed like *""Hey bestie, buy this.""*

📌 **Email Marketing** – Yes, we’re the reason your inbox has 5,672 unread emails. But hey, that one 10% discount email? You *might* open it.

So next time you see an ad for the exact thing you were thinking about, don’t panic. We’re not reading your mind (yet). Just good ol’ marketing magic at work. 🪄✨

I’ve removed everything, washed inside with dish soap and put coffee grounds in it, closed door during the day and left it open over night.. closed again today and it still smells. 

About 1.5 hr ago I’ve scrubbed with lemon, vinegar and baking soda and left the residue there to help soak up smell. It’s still lingering so I’m wondering is it better for me to leave the door open or leave it closed so it can soak up the smell in its contained space? ",2,1740381569.0,CleaningTips,3,1.0,False

I have experience as a lawyer in the states. I also was a solo practitioner and business owner. I didn’t run my business very well because I found out about a month ago that my employee was regularly stealing from me. I was a lawyer for 6 years in the states, doing personal injury defense, insurance fraud investigation, and family law. I also have a background in retail (10 years, 5+ years of retail management). I don’t want to be a solicitor (lawyer) in the UK. It’s expensive to get licensed and I hated the conflict. I dreaded going to work because I felt like opening my email was looking to discover what was going to ruin my day that day. I applied for a project management job with the council here but they said they had someone better qualified. I’ve also applied for HR jobs and personal assistant/admin jobs. But I think I’m going to hear that I’m overqualified for those jobs. In addition to all this, I have bipolar 2 and I’ve not worked since I had a mental breakdown in September, and there’s a lot of PTSD and general anxiety around going back to work/working in general. I’m getting the Sunday scaries on Saturday nights and I don’t even work. Sometimes they develop into panic attacks. I don’t know what I should do, what kind of career I should pursue. I have massive debt from student loans and other debt in the states that I’m declaring bankruptcy on. I don’t feel ready to go back to work but my family’s financial situation is such that I need to to do anything remotely fun on the weekends like go for coffee with friends. We also can’t afford unexpected expenses like when I needed new bras. My husband says he’s okay if I want to wait to return to work but I don’t feel like I can wait, but I’m also still struggling with my mental health. Any advice is appreciated.

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation* ( mega important ) let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while while having a smoke and watching Dutch streamers react too a show called “lang leve de liefde”   .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and think about a million thoughts a second it feels like . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning 🫶🏻)
- a lot of random playlists I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things ( example the weather , how much milk cows produce , songs I wish didn’t exist ?)
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually ( no you don’t have to drink coffee I certainly will ) 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 
-Dutch memes but you won’t get ;) ( what a steal ! ) 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )**

1iww85v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1iww85v/manager_who_i_respected_turned_out_creep/,Manager who I respected turned out creep,"Around 2023, I (26F) worked at a firm for 10-11 months.  Work was good. Office environments was very flexible. We had monthly office dinners. The manager (46-48M) used to invite us to his personal celebration like house warming party, bday party, etc. He was a very caring, kindhearted and humble person. He cared for all the employees like his own children. He is unmarried and childless. He would listen to everyone's woes and try to help everyone. I respected him and was glad to have such a manager. 

Exactly an year ago, due to personal reasons I resigned. I worked on two freelance contacts after resigning with the company, directly with my ex manager, as a consultant. I am yet to be paid for the last contract.  Last week finally the ex manager got funds sanctioned for the project I worked on and the execution has began. He invited me for s celebratory company dinner. But eventually when I reach the venue, turns out four of the colleagues had bailed out. It was just the manager and me. Dinner started very well. Everything was fine. He had got me a big bouquet of flowers. He wore jeans and a tee, and a sports shoe (very unlike him who always wore formals even to company dinners). I sensed something off but not much. 

As dinner progressed, my managers comments started to get creepy. Starting with he mentioned how he was fond of me and appreciated me for my skills and hardwork. Turns out he remembers every minor details about my habits, behaviour, preferences, the way I spoke, like such details that one had to observe very carefully to remember. He said he misses me at work, and I was the light that guided him during his dark times. It was fine until this. 

But eventually the conversation went on like - I got very possessive when you mentioned you would bring some male friend with you for my housewarming party. I just wanted your vibe in the house. I am very possessive and angry when someone interferes in your vibe. I cancelled the housewarming party because you wouldn't come alone.. then I came to this very resturant and ate alone.

2- I want your permission to make you my personal friend. You always keep a wall between us..I only get to see your professional side. I have heard you talk to your friends. You never talk like that to me. And I want to know that part of you more. The one you are with your friends. You don't consider me a friend, but I think we can be great friends.

3 - My friend had his first child. If you feel good, we can go visit him together. I want to introduce you to my best friend and his wife. Just as friends we would go.

4 - you have a different world and I always wanted to be a part of it. You never gave me the permission to be a part of your own unique world. I want to get to know it more 

5 - let's plan a vacation to xyz. Like we would get diff rooms. But you would love that. It's a beautiful place. You will have your privacy and I will get to know you better.

6 - When you are free, come down to the office. I will give everyone off, and then both of us can watch a movie in the conference hall and discuss Project X. 

7 - I know you loved that plant on your desk. And the snacks you stored in the break room. I still have saved it. I stopped having tea or coffee after you left because noone makes it as good as you did. 

8 - Lots of boasting about his earnings. How rich he is. His lifestyle. How much he loves to spend on his friends..and how he doesn't mind spending money on me.

9- I used to send the office vehicle to pick you up but then I noticed some boy dropping you. I didn't ever like it. I hated the sight of him. I wanted him to go away from you. But he would always drop you to work. 

I could have stopped him but then I just wanted to know the whole truth. Because as he kept opening up my perception of him changed. Totally. Glad I found out this way about this man, and thank goodness he didn't hold back and started to talk. Atleast I know his true face and not trust him. I am so glad he never acted on his instincts when I was working with him. And several times we had to work overtime, sometimes alone just with him. Now it made me doubt so much. 

Turns out the bonuses I recieved was never actual bonuses every coworker recieved. It was extra money hoping I would spend more time with him. Everytime we went for field visits, he did it just to get me alone with him. I feel sick to my stomach. I just returned home from dinner have have puked several times. I showered hard. But I still feel his gaze on me. I still feel sick thinking about his intentions. He paid me 3 times salary of other employees (we never discussed compensation at work. It was strictly prohibited and I kept to myself as much as possible at work). And when I asked why, he said because he wanted to compensate me with what I deserved because my presence made him so happy. And whenever I was alone with him he felt blessed. So he thought it was necessary to compensate me for the time I k spent with him. For the way I smiled and made him feel good. I fkng though we were working on projects, checking out quotations whereas the only intention he has was just to have me alone so that he could stare at me. And he mentioned - you have me a very professional smile. You never gave the smile you give your friends. I want you to smile the same way to me 

I  kept firmly rejecting his advances making my intentions very clear. I cut the dinner short and left early. I feel sick to my stomach. The person I had respected and looked upto turned out s creep. A terrible creep. And everytime I was at the office feelings comfortable he was looking at me and having hai thoughts run wild. I haven't been paid for the last contract but I don't even wanna talk or see him. I cut the bouquet into pieces, and stabbed the shit out of it. I have a past of SA and relocated to start fresh. In a new city, new people, new places. I felt so good to have such supportive and respectable company around me. But turns out it was a mirage. It wasn't true. Creeps exist everywhere. I am so tired. I am so fed up. Isn't there a single place I girl can exist. Without being bothered by creeps. Without wondering who might harm her and who might oogle her. Some time just peaceful safe and comfortable. It's been hours since I came back home. And I feel so so so so so sick. There's nothing more I can puke but I still wanna throw up.

1iww7mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1iww7mh/date_na_hindi_mawari/,Date na hindi mawari.,"Hello!! Since 'di naman ako pala post dito, silent reader lang, pero ngayon I'm letting out my frustration here on reddit. 

I'm (21, F) and my ex is (22, M). So, guys ito nga ang kwento. Yung pagka-irita ko ngayon sa ex ko, parang isang tick lang ng bomba, sasabog na talaga. A week ago, we planned to meet after a year without contact with each other, and since magkikita kami, I grab the chance na makuha na yung favorite kong libro na nasa kaniya pa all these years. And Ito nga, days before kami magkita, pinapaalala ko sa kaniya na ibalik na niya sa akin yung libro kasi 'di naman niya binabasa, pinan display lang ata niya sa kwarto niya, then he agreed na ibabalik nga niya. So all set! Ganado na ako kasi shet sa tagal ng panahon, mapapasa akin na ulit yung libro na may sentimental value for me, kasi it is a gift from my lolo. 

And this day came, our plan na mag meet is finally happening. Pero siyempre, in every plan talaga na sineset, 'di maiiwasan na may other challenges. Naka-ready na ako paalis ng bahay, unexpectedly my father went home from work and he decided to eat lunch outside. And 'di naman ako pwede magdahilan kasi once a month lang din naman may ganitong ganap sa family ko kaya I decided to go with them, knowing that my ex is waiting for me sa meeting place namin. I messaged him to wait kasi 'di ko rin inexpect na lalabas kami ng fam. He said ""Take your time"" kaya nakampante naman ako, but annoyingly, 10 mins. pa lang ata nakalipas, he messaged me ""Nasaan ka na?"" and ""Matagal ka pa ba?"" Me naman na pressured what to do with fam and him, tapos siya tanong nang tanong, and I thought he can wait, pero parang hindi pala. Again, he messaged me ""Sana pala sinabi mong magtatagal ka pa, para sana nagpunta muna ako sa ___ to buy pants"" which I ignored and tried to eat my food peacefully. 

After kumain, iniisip ko kung paano ako magpapaalam sa pamilya ko na may dapat akong puntahan. Fortunately, nadaanan namin yung cafe kung saan si ex naghihintay. Nang lumayo kaunti, saka ako nagpa drop at nagdahilan na may kailangan akong bilhin sa isang store, and they don't need to wait for me baka kasi matagalan. 

While walking towards the cafe, I don't know what to react, parang gusto ko na lang atang huwag siyang siputin. But when I saw him, I just rolled my eyes, and straightly walked sa counter to order my drink. He followed me, then he grabbed the menu searching for food. Sabi niya food na lang daw order niya since naka 1 coffee drink na siya, tapos tinatanong pa niya ako kung ano bang gusto kong food, pero siya naman nag decide kung ano yung pagkain na order. Tapos nung magbabayad na, nilabas niya wallet, nilingon ako tapos nagtanong kung meron daw ba akong cash. Nagtaka pa ako and since wala na akong time magtanong kasi nakakahiya naman nasa counter pa kami, naglabas na lang ako ng pera at binayaran ang dapat bayaran. Just what the fuck is happening? 

So like, I paid for the food and my drink. I mean, I don't mind spending my money, but what the? what kind of act was that na pinakita niya? Jeez. So I thought, magtatapos na doon ang kairitahan ko sa kaniya, moments passed then I asked about my book, then he said ""I'm sorry hindi ko nadala"". Right there and then, para na akong ticking bomb. Hindi naman ako ganito ka babaw, pero isa-isa lang sana, mahina ang kalaban. Gusto ko na lang mag cry sa frustration, pero wooooh jusko. 2 days ago na yung pagkikita namin na 'yon, pero lahat ng pangyayari I still can't get over it.   Kabadtrip talaga. And right now, inuunti-unti ko nang i-ghost. Ano pa bang magandang suggestion na gawin sa kaniya? comment down below.

1iww4ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1iww4ev/is_dental_work_mostly_cosmetic/,Is dental work mostly cosmetic?,"I remember seeing a video a while back called “things your dentist won’t tell you.” One of them was that something like 90% of dental work is cosmetic and not really necessary (including fillings for small cavities). That was years ago, and I still think about it. 

I have read that mouthwash doesn’t do much. I’ve read that flossing doesn’t do much. I’ve read that there is no medical need for cleanings twice a year — It just happens to be what most insurance plans pay for so it stuck. I was told I needed braces as a kid. I never got them. My teeth are fine. I have an overbite, but I don’t care. I was told to get my wisdom teeth removed. I never did. I am fine. My wisdom teeth sometimes get infected and inflamed. I take an ibuprofen, and it always clears up in a day or two. I remember asking what happens if I don’t remove my wisdom teeth. The oral surgeon told me I may get an infection. He said I’d need an antibiotic to treat it. I’d rather take an antibiotic than go through the removal process. 

I haven’t been to a dentist since 2020. My appointment got cancelled because of
lock downs, and it broke the habit. I never called back to reschedule. I was always told I had a clean mouth and haven’t had a cavity in like ten years. 

I brush twice a day and floss nightly. I don’t have any major problems with my teeth (aside from the occasional wisdom tooth ache mentioned above) and maybe some staining from coffee. 

I know dental hygiene is important. But if I’m brushing and flossing regularly and have no problems, do I really need to get the cleanings?",1,1740380582.0,askdentists,4,1.0,False

INTP. have a bachelor’s degree. currently in the process of becoming a physical therapist (i take my state board in april!). i’m a huge enjoyer of the pop girlies- sabrina, chappell, NIKI, clairo, etc. and pop culture is kinda my thing. in my spare time i like watching tv shows and reading. i like to hike but haven’t been able to do so in a bit (let’s do a trail 😊). hugeee foodie, i cook but def like to try new things too. wandering in general is fun to me and so is getting coffee/matcha/milk tea, going to concerts, visiting museums. yaper when in the the mood, but i go from 100% to 0% fast. i have very left leaning views and would hope it’s the same for you. not a big fan of organized religion or our government. twitter rat (sometimes lol. loveee collecting trinkets and tchotchkes, my current faves are miffy, loopy and monchhichi. fave movie atm is challengers and fave show is interview with the vampire. was born & raised in the philippines (i’m also a us citizen tho) & i just moved to california in january of 2024 :3

1. **Test It First with Free Tools Start with Google PageSpeed Insights**—it’s free and brutally honest. Plug in your URL, and it’ll flag what’s dragging you down (big images, clunky code, etc.). For the gym, it showed their homepage banner was a 2MB monster—way too heavy. Aim for 70 on mobile
2. **Shrink Those Images** Big pics look great but murder load times. We swapped the gym’s hi-res class photos for compressed versions using free image compressing tools, I used TinyPNG and it's not a promotion. Dropped them to under 200KB each with no visible quality loss. Pro tip: stick to JPGs for photos and PNGs for logos—keeps things lean.
3. **Ditch the Bloat Their site had a flashy theme with tons of animations**—cool, but overkill for a small biz. We pared it back to a simple, clean design (think minimal fonts and fewer widgets). Focus on what matters: clear CTAs like “Book a Class” or “Contact Us.” Less clutter = faster load.
4. **Mobile-First Mindset** Most gym-goers check schedules on their phones. We made sure the buttons were thumb-friendly and the text was readable without zooming. PageSpeed flagged this too—mobile optimization isn’t optional anymore.

It’s not rocket science, but the gym owner said inquiries jumped 13% after the tweak—people weren’t bouncing off a laggy site anymore. You don’t need a dev budget to pull this off; just some elbow grease and the right tools. Happy to answer questions if anyone’s struggling with this!",0,1740380292.0,smallbusiness,1,0.33,False
1iww1js,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1iww1js/adani_east_lounge_experience_at_mumbai_t2/,Adani East Lounge experience at Mumbai T2 International,"Got entry using amex platinum reserve. According to staff there the accepted cards still remain rupay psu and amex only. I have no clue why they don't publish an official list for display. Every person who walks up checks all their cards and staff remains busy in this only. 


The quality is obviously better than the pathetic loyalty lounge ( I have heard it is now closed, not sure about this). Every experience there has been bad and if adani didn't allow entry I usually just go to the gate or Costa coffee. 

The adani east lounge was almost full especially the sofa seats. As you know our country men even the empty seats are covered with bags so you don't actually know if someone is sitting or not. 

The only seating available was the uncomfortable high chairs at the windows. 

The food quality seems to have deteriorated. Every thing I tried was either cold or not tasty. Shades of loyalty lounge food. The coffee machine spat out hot tasteless milky water. 

There was a board saying we can order stuff if needed like any sort of eggs but after trying to hunt down staff who were busy running here to there not paying attention to me I gave up, picked up a couple of bottles of water and headed to Starbucks. 

It is still much better than the erstwhile notorious loyalty lounge but when it initially opened the food and attention was akin to their business class lounge.  Will be testing lounges in Indo china to see how they compare to adani. 

Most indian lounges with cc access I have been to suck. Dehradun was crowded and small. Just entered grabbed a coffee and water and left, no place to sit. Delhi t3 encalm had such a long queue at 3 am that I didn't even bother. Haven't been to 080.

My favorite indian lounge experience has been Adani and Encalm Prive on my business class tickets. Encalm Prive I would say is better than krisflyer Eva and Cathay business lounges which I have been to. It is a class apart. ",5,1740380285.0,CreditCardsIndia,2,1.0,False

1iww08l,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1iww08l/day_11_hoi_an_ancient_town/,Day 11 - Hoi An Ancient Town,"This is Day 11 of 21 days in Vietnam. 

Today it’s off to Hoi An Ancient Town for another day of exploration. This will be the 2nd time visiting since 2015. I wonder how much the town has changed since my last visit. At our hotel entrance, we board a comfy 30 minute shuttle to Hoi An. I’m definitely not sleeping on this ride as the journey will be as scenic as ever driving along the Hai Van Pass.



Along the way, I’m met with the mesmerizing views of the tropical coastline with its dramatic cliff drops and the glimmering ocean. I’ll never get tired of this view. The road is well-paved and winding and honestly looks like a blast to drive. I’ve now seen the Ocean Cloud pass on the train and in a car. The next time I visit central Vietnam, I’ll surely visit the Hai Van Pass by motorbike.



When we arrive in Hoi An, the first thing we do is check into a homestay right outside the town center. Once checked in, each of us is given a bike to explore the Old Town and the countryside. The group then cycles into town in search of some breakfast and coffee. We got to try the famous Madam Khanh’s banh mi sandwich which was delectable. Madam Khanh herself was so warm and hospitable to our whole group. I love banh mi and the grilled meat in the sandwich was juicy. Next, we visited Raw Coco Coffee just a short bike ride away. I decided on the special, ca phe dua or coconut coffee. Coconut coffee was okay to me, I thought it made the coffee more sweeter than it needed to be. 



After fueling up it was now time to visit one of the town’s many tailors, Yaly Couture. I got a suit tailored here when I last visited in 2015 while backpacking Southeast Asia. Having outgrown that suit many moons ago, I decided to get a new one tailored. I chose a charcoal fabric with a dark green silk lining for my suit. Turn around time will be one and a half days. I’ll be shipping the suit back home to Vancouver, Canada with the help of the store. 



With about 30 minutes left before the group gathers at the meeting point, I decided to cruise around town for fun. I admired the centuries old buildings and the Japanese bridge in the town center. I can tell the buildings have been renovated with a fresh batch of paint in recent years. Although it was a nice ride around town, tourism has really gone up in recent years and biking through the crowds of tourists was quite the challenge. 



After arriving at the meeting point, we rode off into the countryside where we’re met with the quiet and serene fields of rice paddies. I see farmers working the fields with their water buffaloes. There’s a nearby river where locals peacefully paddle their basket boats. I can also hear birds chirping while cycling by on the dusty pathways. 



Our destination for the day is Tra Que Vegetable Village, a farm well located between a lagoon and a river. The soil here is fertile and rich, as the farm grows various different kinds of vegetables and spices. We were told that the vegetables here have a unique taste due to the soil being fertilized by seaweed. Pretty cool stuff. The team was given an hour to explore, some decided to give farming a try while others went for a herbal foot bath. I chose the latter for a bit of rest and relaxation.



Following the trip to Tra Que farm, we head back to town to visit the Precious Heritage Museum, an exhibit on the many different ethnic tribes found in Vietnam. The main exhibit was large portraits of the ethnic folks up close and personal. It was cool seeing the detailed faces of the ethnic people along with their colorful costumes and garbs. There were also many traditional clothing and cultural artifacts on display like musical instruments and heirlooms. I got a deeper understanding behind the different tribes, even noticing a few of the ethnic tribes I saw on the Ha Giang Loop.



After about an hour at the exhibit, the group decides to go for dinner. The food in the central region is supposed to be special and unlike every other part of Vietnam. We went for banh khoai, a crispy fried pancake with shrimp, pork and bean sprouts inside, that we wrap up with lettuce and herbs, to then dip in the sweet and tangy fish sauce. It’s crunchy and delicious and I couldn’t help but go for seconds and thirds.



After dinner, the group boards a lantern boat ride on the Thu Bon River. While cruising the riverway, we got to see Old town from a different perspective at night with the beautiful lantern lit buildings. The river is calm so it’s a really relaxing experience and we even got to release flower-shaped lanterns into the water for good luck and fortune. This was a remarkable experience as I felt a sense of spirituality while doing so. It was a great end to the night before heading back to the hotel for an early night’s rest.

1iww050,https://i.redd.it/ouek45gnb1le1.jpeg,yall mind if i just loredump my entire oc's lore rq?,"toon name: rosy
based off of a rosy maple moth
personality; shy and softspoken, but they're hyperaware of any recording devices or camera's pointed at toons that don't consent or enjoy having a camera pointed at them (helps enforce dandy's rule of 'no photo's of astro')
used to be a main, but got hurt and even traumatized, chose to leave mains for safety reasons and 'to stop it from spreading'
uses they/them pronouns, but doesn't mind being called a he every now and then by a trusted toon

looks like:
a rosy maple moth, completely black eyes and a light blue sweater with a star stitched onto the front of it, wears black pants with red socks instead of shoes

likes; astro. their piano (before their ex broke it) gliding (before vee caused them to injure their wings during a quiz show) dandy. their keytar. their nose canceling headphones
dislikes; shrimpo. their old handler. twisteds. vee. maple.
main gimick: keytar melody
what it does: de-aggro any twisted around them for 10 sec, can also be useful for distracting twisted glisten, causing t.glisten to head right for rosy and chill with them. does not work on twisted dandy and twisted maple (lore reasons)
what you need to get them:
aster's failed experiment (if you don't have it from the event you need 100% twisted aster research)
100% twisted maple research
50% twisted rosy research
event: aster's lab panic
event details: 'whoops! looks like someone was messing with aster's experiments while he was gone! help him clean up the mess and return his research to him for unique rewards! (dandy hint: if someone brings aster some coffee aster might let slip something interesting about his research! i'll give ya 20 tapes if you tell me what aster says!'

event rewards (if you don't wanna do the research for rosy):
rosy themselves (if you don't do the research)
rosy's noise canceling headphones (again, if you don't do the research.)
lab assistant skin for rosy (you get this after the event ends regardless just as long as you play at least 3 days otherwise you'll get to keep all your ichor and a small amount extra)  aster's failed experiment
10% moony research (for a good support toon, you can't rlly unlock him until the 'astrology mayhem event' when moony visits gardenview to see how the stars look from earth and miscalculating badly, crashing into the elevator area)

twisted rosy: a stationary twisted, doesn't mind if you stand near them, just don't look at their face. or have vee anywhere near them as that will aggro them.
if on the floor: applies the 'fogged up' area condition if they're alone,causing the entire floor to be covered in fog for 20 seconds, then the fog lifts for 20 sec, then returns, there'll be glowing outlines around your teammates the closer they are to you,but the fog will just not be there if twisted moony is there (t.rosy and t.moony go on a walk together, which can de-aggro rosy if t. moony finds them and let you chat away with them, if normal moony is in your team then they'll have to 'babysit' t.rosy) or if there's a blackout
what to do if you see this twisted: you can walk/sprint/dash past them as long as ur character doesn't look at their face while dashing, or if you're vee. if you aggro t.rosy, break line of sight since they need los to alert another twisted of who they just saw and they have a short attention span.
after breaking los, they'll go back to sitting down, covering their face with their wings.
if t.moony is with them: t.rosy can't see that well since they'll be covering their face so that people don't get hurt from being spotted, but only one hand is covering their face (kinda like twisted astro) and the other hand is holding t. moony's hand as they walk around. sometimes they'll stop walking and sit down on the ground, sometimes blocking off an extractor or a doorway or hiding spot, but if playing as pebble or coal or having them on your team, you can bark to keep them away from specific areas (and as astro if t.rosy and t.moony are sitting you can use your skill to put them to sleep)
trinket: rosy's noise canceling headphones
'they've seen better days'
+10% extraction speed if equipped on any toon
+10% skill cooldown if equipped on astro specifically.

skins
normal: 'soft wakeup call
variant 2: 'aster's assistant'
vintage: 'old but gold'
Christmas: 'it's snowy outside..'
halloween: 'mothman?!'
birthday: 'birthday moth'

dialog with other toons:

if shrimpo is in the elevator:
shrimpo: I HATE HOW QUIET YOU ARE!

rosy: *quietly* and i hate the fact your this close to making it into someone's ramen, shrimpo.

if dandy is in the elevator (shopkeeper dandy will work)
rosy: *quietly* hey dandy...! i'll be trying to play my keytar later, is anyone going to be asleep where i usually play?

dandy: 'probably not! i'd ask astro before you play, though. also what's with you playing it so much nowadays?'

if astro is in the elevator

rosy: *quietly* 'hey astro...! i asked dandy this, but is anyone going to be asleep where i usually play? i'm trying to play my keytar more so i can help calm down twisteds easier' 

astro: 'oh! if i remember right...boxen and goob sometimes fall asleep in your usual spot, waiting for you to show up and play.'

rosy: '..oh..! i didn't know i had an audience..'

astro: *chuckles* ""don't worry, vee hasn't found out you picked up your keytar here recently!""

Also a long read so if you’re not prepared for that, this may not be the post for you. Sorry. 

So here’s the thing. I (32F) have got this MASSIVE crush on a friend (30M) who we’ll call Bob. However, I’m also married. My husband (31M) who we’ll just call Joe, is mentally and emotionally abusive towards me and my child. I already know you’re going to say I should leave, but it is just simply not that cut and dry.

Bob is married to Kim (31F). Bob is planning on leaving Kim, and I am planning on leaving Joe. Bob and I have both been isolated by our spouse, and have been venting to one another for about 2 months now. We will both be leaving our spouses after we tie up a couple of loose ends. 

I have never cheated in a relationship, and I do not plan on cheating, as I have very strong morals. I have not in any way professed my feelings for Bob, and I will not until we are both divorced. As of now the conversation has been merely platonic between Bob and I. 

I work with Bob, and although we work in a very large place, we cross paths often. When I have seen and talked to him in the past, there have been some things that have struck me as potentially having been intended to be flirtatious without being outright advances. He has winked and given me that prolonged eye contact and sly smile before parting ways more than once. He also tells me things like “you’re the only person I can talk to about this”. There’s much more that is similar, but for the sake of privacy, I’ll leave it at those two examples. We have even stayed in contact outside of work and have talked for hours at a time. 

I told myself a long time ago that if this marriage didn’t work out, it would be the end of relationships for me, because of my repeating history of shit luck with relationships, and so that I can focus all of my attention on my child. Because of this, I’ve not allowed myself to so much as even be physically attracted to anyone, and have consistently talked myself out of the idea of ever even accepting if propositioned with something as simple as a coffee date in the future. However, even though he is not my usual type, and I know how wrong it is (which I’m sure some of you guys will remind me of in the comments), there is something about Bob that just sends butterflies in my stomach. I can’t put a finger on it. He may be the exception to my rule. I haven’t felt butterflies since I met my widower as a teenager.

Again, I will NOT cheat. I will NOT make any advances or admit to any of the feelings unless we are both divorced. I’m just curious what you think, because I am driving myself crazy pondering on all of this.

Also we live in California, and both Bob and I have expressed our desires to leave here as soon as possible, and ironically we have the same ideal relocation destination. We also have very similar core values and similar interests and even share a love for the same hobby. I just wonder if Bob may be the first page of the next chapter for me. It feels so weird to say that after having sworn off the possibility or desire for any future relationship after my marriage.

I suppose my question is, do you think it’s possible that he senses this and feels a similar way? Or do you think I’m grasping for straws and overreacting to friendly kindness?",3,1740379789.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False
1iwvvwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendship/comments/1iwvvwq/adult_friendships_are_just_as_hard_as_childhood/,Adult friendships are just as hard as childhood friendships,"Growing up as the only daughter with only brothers, I often felt isolated, with little supervision and guidance. I never really formed close bonds with other girls, and most of my friendships either ended badly or just faded away. I had a rough time fitting in—whether it was being excluded from larger friend groups or not being able to afford the activities others could. One instance that stands out is when I wanted to join the Brownies. My mom bought me a uniform and paid the fee, but after that, she offered no help. At just seven years old, I had to walk to meetings alone and try to manage on my own. Seeing other girls with their parents and friends there, I quickly stopped going.

That sense of being on the outside looking in has followed me through life. Even in cheerleading, where I was part of a team, I didn’t form any lasting connections. I roomed with the coach during camp because all of the other girls had cliques. While I wasn’t unattractive, I didn’t feel like I fit in with the “pretty” girls. I didn't have enough personality to fit in with the ""cool"" girls. I was intelligent but not smart enough to hold a conversation with the ""smart"" girls. The ""normal"" girls just lived their lives and showed no interest in me. 

I rejected the boys who treated me well and sought out the ones who didn’t. Not because I didn't like the normal boys, but because the cute and cool guys would open me up to a social group. Without a close female friend to guide me, I made a lot of poor decisions.

When I met my husband, I wasn’t physically attracted to him, but he was kind, funny, and treated me like I mattered. Over time, I fell in love with how he cherished me, and he became my lifeline. Other than him, I still struggle to form close connections inside and outside my family. Failed friendships have haunted me into adulthood.

At one point, I thought I’d try something new—I started approaching potential friends with honesty, telling them I wasn’t good at making friendships last but wanted to try. The first person I tried this with agreed, and for six months, it felt like we were building something meaningful. Then they started dating someone seriously, and just like that, I was dropped. The reason? Their partner thought we were too close. I was heartbroken, and it felt like another painful reminder that maybe deep connections just weren’t in the cards for me. I tried again. the second person also wanted to be my friend. As we talked more, all they wanted to do was complain about their life and career. I loved it for a while but it was so one-sided that it didn't work out .

My husband has been incredibly supportive through all of this. He sees how much I long for that connection, but every time I try, things just don’t seem to work out. Now, I have a few friends, but we don’t talk often or see each other regularly. When we do spend time together, I’m thrilled, but I always hold back, afraid that if I say the wrong thing, I’ll ruin things. 

I am not good at follow up and anxiety makes me shy away from saying yes when I know I should. Go to a bar? Never! I won't know what to say and I'm not a drinker. Go shopping? I'm game when I'm not broke. Go to a concert? Nope, instant migraine. Have a game night? Sign me up! That is, until I get in my head that I won't be able to leave when I feel ready and as a result hurt your feelings or be miserable. Go out to dinner? I don't enjoy eating out and get bored easily. Not to mention I can't stand the sound of people chewing. Could I meet for coffee? That my friend, I can do. Can we chat while on a drive? I'm in! I love a good conversation that is give and take. If you need to vent and don't want advice, I've got you. But will you listen when I need the same? 

I’ve come to realize that I don’t really know how to form lasting friendships, even after all these years. My marriage is my saving grace—my husband is my best friend—but I still have so much love to give and no idea why I keep failing. I don’t need someone to fix me; I just want someone to accept me as I am, to let me be open and honest without judgment. I’ve tried therapy with a few different therapists, but it felt like they were more interested in prescribing medication than truly listening.

I’m still hoping for that one lasting connection, but I don’t know how to get there. I just want to be understood and to have someone I can text, call and just be heard.  Why does that seem impossible? 

This was heavy on my heart tonight. Since I don't really have anyone to talk to, I thought if share with you. ",1,1740379645.0,friendship,1,1.0,False
1iwvviq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mother-Effective-797/comments/1iwvviq/the_road_to_the_mountaintop/,The Road to The Mountaintop,"There's something about being on the open road that just seems to exemplify the concept of freedom itself. When you're riding down an endless stretch of highway with nothing but your thoughts to keep you company, you feel like you can really think. It's not like the rare quiet moments you get in everyday life, it's more prolonged and profound. Maybe that's why I decided to get in my car and drive three days ago.

I had been going down the highway for a long time, only stopping for gas and bathroom breaks, when I finally decided food was necessary as well. It was the dead of night, so there weren't many options, but I finally found a Waffle House sitting conveniently next to the highway. I headed in, being greeted by warm air and the smell of coffee.

I sat down and waited for the waitress to come over and acknowledge me. She was in her thirties, I think, with long brown hair and a bright smile that cut across the room. She flashed that smile in my direction to let me know she was on her way as she finished up with the elderly couple she was helping. It wasn't long before she was handing me a menu that I didn't need to see.

“Hey there, honey. What are you having?” she asked me, each word seeming to drip sweetness.

“Uh, coffee, please,” I muttered.

I've never been a very social person and when it comes to the art of conversation, I'm not much of a aficionado. Still, she either didn't notice or was too polite to let on that she did.

“That's no problem, I'll have it out in just a moment. So where you headed?” she said while retrieving a cup and a pot of coffee from the counter.

“I'm just headed out west for now,” I replied, not knowing quite how to answer that question.

“I thought you were going to say you were headed out to the Mountain Top,” she laughed.

“There's a mountain out this way?”

“No, not a real mountain, that's just the name of place. They call it The Mountain Top because people go there to talk to God.”

She poured a cup of coffee and I took a long sip before continuing.

“They go there to talk to God?”

“Something like that. I've never been, myself, but people are headed up there all the time.”

“Sounds kind of... crazy, you know?”

“Maybe. But people head up there all the time anyways.”

I looked over at the elderly couple sitting on the other side of the diner.

“What about them? Are they headed to The Mountain Top?”

“Yep. Like I said, every headed down this road is usually going there. You might be one of the first people I've ever seen that isn't,” she said, her big smile starting to unnerve me a little.

“Well, I've never even heard of the place,” I told her, taking another drink of the coffee.

“You have now, sugar. The Mountain Top is just about a day's ride out further west. You'll probably pass it. Lord knows you can't miss all the signs they have pointing it out.”

I shrugged and fell into the silence I had become so accustomed to as of late. Talking felt like it took more energy than it used to, and I wanted to save every bit of it for the road ahead.

I thought that would be the end of it, but she said one more thing to me when I went to pay the check.

“Thanks for dropping in. You should go to The Mountain Top. I think it's where you need to be right now.”

I didn't respond, just gave a shy smile and walked out to my car. The way she had insisted didn't sit right with me. I was more determined than ever to drive right past that place and hoped this would be the last I heard of it.

If only it had been that easy.

I got back in my car and flicked on the radio, hoping something other than droning of my engine and tires would aid in keeping me awake and alert. There wasn't much out here in the way of radio stations, mostly gospel music and a classical station. However, there was one that came through clear of a man who spoke in a low but kindly voice.

“Hey there, all you weary travelers. I'll be taking calls for the next few minutes to answer any questions you may have. Go ahead caller, you're on the air.”

“Hello?” came the elderly voice of a woman.

“Yes mam, go ahead with your question.”

“Yes, I'm headed to The Mountain Top right now and just wanted to know if I needed to bring anything along.”

The radio DJ laughed a little.

“No, all you need is your questions. Questions and a little bit of faith. Go ahead, next caller, you're on.”

The next voice was a young woman.

“Hi, Nate! I was just wondering about the trials, what happens if we fail?”

“Don't worry, we all fail. The only trial that really matters is how determined you are to keep trying. Let's take one more. You're on with Nate, go ahead.”

This last one was a man's voice. He sounded tired.

“Yea, what would you say to a doubter? Like, someone who doesn't want to go to The Mountaintop even though it's calling them?”

Nate sighed heavily through the microphone.

“If they're called, it doesn't matter. They'll end up there one way or another. Okay, that's enough questions for now. Before we go to some music, we have a special message for Moses Pearson.”

I almost slammed on the brakes when I heard my name being spoken over the radio.

“Moses, I know you're listening right now. You need to know that The Mountaintop is calling you. The next few days are going to be pretty intense for you. You got to let go and go with it. You're not meant to get to the place you're going. You're meant to get to The Mountaintop. Happy trails, friend.”

Maybe it was meant for someone else with my same name. There was probably a perfectly reasonable explanation for it, like the waitress calling up the radio after seeing me in the Waffle House. No, that couldn't be it, I'd never told her my name. Regardless, I was certain this was all some kind of trick, an elaborate hoax to play on unsuspecting tourists. Either way, I wasn't going to The Mountaintop.

I kept driving for quite a while after that, maybe two or three hours. My eyes were getting heavy and fatigue was starting to set in. I knew I'd have to pull over to sleep soon, whether I wanted to keep going or not. Thankfully, I saw a sign for a motel rearing over the highway in the distance.

“The Midian Inn, exit in four miles.”

I had been anticipating sleeping in my car that evening, so I was pretty relieved to see another option all the way out here. I pulled off the highway when I reached the exit and drove up the only building for miles around.

There was a sign with the words “Midian Inn” standing next to the little drive way up to the office area. I parked and approached, spying an old man sitting behind a pane of glass at the front area. He had been reading a book as I approached, but put it down when he saw me.

“Good evening, mister,” he greeted me once I was within earshot. “I take it you'll be wanting a room?”

“Yea, I just need one bed. It's just me.”

“We can do that.”

I paid the man and he handed me a key with a tag attached that displayed the room number: 215.

“Okay, check out is at eleven in the morning tomorrow. Make sure to get something to eat when you wake up, it'll be your last chance before doing the first trial.”

“First trial?” I asked, getting a sinking feeling in my stomach as he smiled.

“The first trial of The Mountaintop. That's where you're headed, isn't it?”

“No... I'm just passing through,” I said, swallowing my irritation.

“My apologies, mister. Where are you headed, if you're not going there?”

“I'm headed to Corpus Christi, in Texas. For some reason, my GPS picked this route, so this is the way I'm headed.”

“That's awful strange, but the highway will lead there eventually, if that's where you want to go.”

I was about to turn to walk away, but stopped and asked the question I had been trying to push down the whole time.

“What is The Mountaintop anyways?”

“Depends on who you ask. Some people think they can go there to talk to God, others think that it's a pilgrimage site or something. Over the years, I've arrived at the conclusion that it's different things to different people at different times.”

“You mean you've never been?”

“Oh, I've been a few times, but it was different each time. The first time I went, it was just a section of forest with nothing there but a hot spring. The second time, it was a some kind of church. The last time I went there was to scatter my wife's ashes. It was a graveyard that time. I don't know if they change location every so often or something. The road leading up to it has so many twists and turns that it's hard to remember if it's in the same place or not.”

“Well, I'm not headed that way. I'm just trying to get to Corpus Christi. Still, it does sound interesting.”

The old man smiled and went back to his book, giving me the cue to head to my room. I opened the door and looked around at the hotel room which seemed to have been a snapshot of the early eighties. The décor was dated and the carpet was shaggy, making me feel a little nostalgic as I kicked off my shoes and settled into the bed. I knew sleep would come pretty quickly, so I didn't bother taking a shower. I'd save that for the morning.

That night, I dreamed about my wife. In my dream, she was sitting next to the bed, leaning over me and brushing my hair out of my face. She didn't say anything, just smiled at me reassuringly. She leaned in and kissed my forehead just as I woke up.

I took a shower and got dressed. I was anxious to be back on the road and didn't want to waste any time, so I immediately went to go check out. I walked to the little office area and was surprised to see the same old man that I had checked in with last night. I figured it would have been someone else in the morning, but he was smiling at me as I approached.

“Sleep well?” he asked as I slid him back the key.

“Yea, I think I'm ready to get back on the road now.”

“You still think you're going to Corpus Christi?” he asked, making me feel a little uneasy.

“Yea, that's still my destination,” I answered with a nervous laugh.

“Yea, Jonah thought he was going to go somewhere too. That was before the whale got him,” the old man responded with a smile.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“I mean, you have a good trip, Moses.”

“How do you know my name?” I responded, anger creeping into my voice.

“You've been called,” was the only thing he said, before looking down to his book, which I could see was a copy of Moby Dick.

I probably should have asked more questions in that moment, but instead, I walked away. I was anxious to get away from this place quickly, unable to shake the feeling that I was in some kind of danger. The sooner I saw The Mountaintop disappearing into my rear view, the better.

As the Midian Inn disappeared behind me, I thought about how the old man had learned my name and decided he probably saw my ID in my wallet when I went to pay him last night. Another happenstance that can be completely explained a way with rationality. It's such a shame that I didn't accept that. The whole thing just felt off, like some massive cult was documenting my movements and keeping tabs on me. Either way, it was nothing distance couldn't solve, so I set myself to putting as much distance between myself and all this as I could.

The minutes crept by as the sound of my tires spinning on the road became the only thing I could hear. I had been struggling with the urge to turn on my radio again, simultaneously worried that I'd hear the DJ speaking to me again and curious of what this was all really about. Eventually, I gave in to curiosity and turned the dial.

“This is Nate saying good morning to all you listeners from The Moutaintop! We're going to take some calls before going back to the music. Caller, you're on the air with Nate.”

“Hi, Nate!” came a young lady's voice, bubbly and full of excitement. “I just wanted to say that I just left the Mountaintop and it was amazing! What happens if someone is called there and doesn't go?”

“Good question, mam. It doesn't matter if someone wants to go or not when they're called, they'll end up there one way or another. The Mountaintop isn't something you can just ignore, after all. Next caller, you're on!”

“Hey Nate, what is the Mountaintop anyways?” came the voice of a young man.

“The Mountaintop is something that's hard to explain, but I'll do my best. It's where God touches creation. We're all sinners and we're all lost, but He guides us back to the path, and The Mountaintop is like the part of a compass that faces north. Next caller, go ahead!”

“Hey Nate, I just wanted to send a shout out to Moses! He's on his way to The Mountaintop right now, even though I think he's going to try to run. Do you think you can give him some words of encouragement?”

I recognized that voice. It was the old man from the inn.

“Moses, I know you're listening. You're headed down the highway right now, probably scared and confused. All the answers you need are waiting for you at The Mountaintop. Be not afraid. You know who said that? Gabriel, when he told Mary Jesus was on His way. He told that to Joseph when he feared to take Mary for his wife. He said it to Paul when he feared he'd be shipwrecked. Well, Moses, keep your eyes and ears open, because Gabriel is going to say it to you. Be not afraid.”

As if on cue, I saw a large billboard rising over the road, a plain white rectangle with large black words printed across it.

“Be not afraid.”

I slammed down on the gas, my heart racing. Despite the commandment of the billboard, I don't think I've ever been more terrified in my life.

I sped along, the radio switching for speech to the sounds of smooth jazz. I didn't have an explanation for what was happening, and I didn't try to rationalize it anymore. I just knew I wanted to run as fast as I could to get the hell out here.

It was another hour or two down the road that I saw the large sign telling me that the next exit would lead me to the first trial of The Mountaintop. For some reason, I just knew that if I blew past that exit, I'd be home free. So I pressed down on the accelerator, my car jumping forward as it gained speed. I glanced at the speedometer and saw I was going over a hundred miles an hour. The exit blurred past me and I grinned. I finally felt like I had escaped. That's when I saw something on the road up ahead and slammed on my brakes.

Too late.

I managed to slow my car down, but I still smashed into the thing going about forty miles an hour. It was a miracle I wasn't injured, but my car wasn't so lucky. I climbed out and looked at the front and saw both the front tires has burst and been shredded by the plastic of whatever it was I crashed into. It was something big, a large plastic thing laying in the middle of the highway. I walked around to get a better look at it and almost fainted when I finally realized what I was laying my eyes on.

It was a giant plastic figurine of a whale.

I climbed back into my car and cranked it, momentarily determined to drive it on the shredded tires all the way to the next exit, but it sputtered and didn't turn over. I cursed and climbed back out, pulling out my cellphone and noticing I didn't have any signal in the area. So calling a towtruck wasn't going to work.

I started walking forward eventually, deciding I'd get to the next exit and call from there. The sun beat down from overhead, drawing beads of precious moisture from my brow and burning my skin. It was a hard journey, but I was determined to get to the next exit and stay away from The Mountaintop.

I'd walked for three hours, the sun arcing along and assaulting me every step of the way. As I saw an exit looming in the distance, however, I felt renewed vigor and picked up my pace. That pace slowed to a halt when I saw the sign over the exit.

“The Mountaintop, first trial.”

I didn't understand how it could have been possible, but I was looking at the same exit I had just driven past earlier. If I strained my eyes, I could even make out my car still smashed halfway into the plastic whale in the distance. I thought about triying to walk away again, but thirst won out over my desire to flee. I started walking towards The Mountaintop.

The exit led to a neat little parking lot devoid of cars. I remember getting nervous that there would be no one there, but still took the little dirt road leading into the wooded area ahead. I was thankful for the trees blocking the unforgiving sun as I walked along, giving some respite to my sunburned skin and sweat drenched body. After walking for a few minutes, I spotted a small, squat wooden building ahead. It looked almost like a cross between a log cabin and a convenience store. I arrived at the entrance and pulled open the door, breathing a sigh of relief as I was greeted by the cold air. I had half expected it to be locked.

Inside was even more like a convenience store, with coolers housing drinks and aisles of various goods. However, none of them were familiar to me. There were bags of what I thought were chips labeled “Manna” and bottles of water with brand name “Siloam.” It was all very strange, as was the young black lady behind the counter.

“Congratulations on making it through the first trial!” she greeted me.

“What are you talking about?” I asked, grabbing a bottle of the water and bringing it to the counter.

“You made it through the desert. That's the first trial,” she explained.

I didn't respond, feeling too tired, and pulled out my wallet to pay for the water.

“Oh, you don't need to pay. That's yours,” she said, pushing the bottle towards me.

I looked at her warily, but unscrewed the lid and drank most of it in several greedy gulps. I've never heard of Siloam Water, but I think it was the sweetest water I've ever tasted in my life.

“You ready for the second trial?” she asked, smiling kindly at me.

“Actually, I just need to use your phone and the number for a towing company,” I shot back with an irritated look.

“For your car down the road? It's already been picked up and is getting repaired. It will be back here when you're done. That'll be after you reach The Mountaintop though.”

“I'm not going.”

“Sugar, you don't have a choice. You've been called.”

“Listen here, you crazy bitch, I'm not going to your stupid clubhouse or whatever it is!”

She looked completely unfazed by my outburst, which in turn, made me feel downright terrified.

“Look at you, Moses, so quick to get back on that road. Where you headed anyways? What's at the end of that road for you? You think your wife is waiting for you down in Corpus Christi?”

Her voice was kind and dripping with a tone of sympathy, but her words only served to anger me. Yet, even more than anger, they scared me.

“Shut up...” was all I can manage to say.

“Get yourself on up the road to the second trial. I'm sure they have a phone you can use.”

I started to turn to head out the door, when she whistled to get my attention and I turned back, just in time to catch another bottle of water she tossed at me.

“And while you're at it Moses, maybe watch your mouth?”

I didn't respond and stormed back out the door. The path stretched further along going a little uphill. I downed the rest of the first bottle and threw it on the ground. It seemed ridiculous, but if littering was the best revenge I could muster in this moment, then I'd take it.

I started walking up the hill, looking for the next building or whatever the hell it was. As I walked, I felt my fear and anger ebb away, being too exhausted from everything happening to maintain such heightened emotions. Instead, I allowed myself to sink into a comfortable misery. The wooded area pressed in from all sides, and as I walked, I spotted what looked like a noose hanging from a tree. Then another. Soon, I was wading through a sea of them.

I should of felt afraid by such threatening imagery, but instead, I felt... sadness. More sadness than I could possibly put into words. Towards the end of the path was a ladder heading up a tree to one of the nooses, and I thought hard about climbing it. I walked up and rested a hand against the wooden plank nailed there and closed my eyes.

“Feeling lost, stranger?”

I jumped and looked behind me to see an man with a thick beard looking at me with an amused expression.

“Uh, yea, I'm looking for a phone.”

The man laughed, a cheerful juxtaposition in the midst of the nooses.

“Oh Lord! I don't think you'll find a phone up there!”

“Listen, I just want to get out of here.”

His tone changed from mirth to a hardened seriousness as he eyed me, looking me fully up and down in a way that made me want to squirm.

“No, you want peace.”

I opened my mouth to protest, but found myself unable to speak.

“You want peace and you won't find that up there either,” he said with a wary glance towards the top of the ladder.

“Where would I find it then?” I asked, tears welling in my eyes.

“You already know. You just need to quit running from it.”

I closed my eyes, feeling the tears roll down my cheeks as I sucked in a labored breath.

“I just need to go. I need to get back on the road.”

“You're on it, stranger. You just have to keep walking it.”

I felt a sudden rush of anger and rounded on him to scream. I wanted to scream that he was a moron. I wanted to hit him with all my strength. I wanted to release all the frustration boiling inside me in that moment, but when I opened my eyes and spun around, he was gone.

I looked around, wondering where he had disappeared to, but there was no one there. I did see a path leading deeper into the woods though, and decided to take that.

I walked along, leaving the rope laden trees behind me and pushed forward. I walked for a long time, eventually seeing the trees thin away as I breached a clearing, then almost fell to my knees.

There, in the middle of the clearing, as a hospital bed. I recognized it immediately, having spent enough time beside one. I approached it and collapsed to my knees, burying my face into the linen sheets and stifling a sob.

“You miss her.”

I didn't look up, just froze there. The sheets even smelled like her. I felt a hand touch my shoulder, gently resting there as the female voice continued.

“What do you think she'd say if she knew where you were going.”

“She can't say anything,” I responded, lifting my head up a little. “She's dead.”

“That's not what I asked you, Moses. Stop running from the answer.”

Maybe it was the motherly way she spoke to me, but I just couldn't rouse myself into the anger I had felt earlier. Instead, I answered her question.

“She'd say I was being a fool. That I was being selfish.”

“No, Moses. She'd say that you are loved. And you are.”

I looked up then, seeing a middle aged woman with a face full of mercy. She smiled at me and brushed my hair back the same way my wife used to.

“She'd say she misses you. She'd say you are strong enough to keep going, even if you don't believe it. Most importantly, she'd say she loves you and always will.”

I cried, tears rolling down my cheeks, then buried my head into the sheets that smelled of her again.

“I'm sorry...” I muttered, but when I looked up, the woman was gone. The sun was setting and there was a trail across the clearing that I knew I had to walk. So I got up, my heart still aching, and walked towards it.

I didn't have far to walk. Just a little bit ahead was the top of the hill, stones paving the summit in a neat circle. An old fashioned well stood atop the center, which I approached cautiously. For some reason, the well filled me with a deep sense of foreboding. I was a few feet away from it when a new voice called out to me.

“Don't get too close to it, Moses.”

I turned to see a young man with long hair standing there. He must have been in his mid twenties, his face calm and serene as he strode towards me.

“You know, this well usually isn't here. It's usually in a small town on a midwestern farm, tormenting a family that grows corn there. It's a long story.”

“Why am I here?” I asked, exhausted.

“Because I called you, Moses,” the young man said, pulling a piece of meat from his pocket and tossing it into the well. “We all face monsters in our lives. Some of those monsters are like this well, something tangible and providing an exterior threat. Most of us will never have to deal with anything like that. Most of us will have to battle interior threats, which are far more dangerous. Why are you going to Corpus Christi?”

“If you are who I think you are, then you already know,” I answered, hearing my anger creeping into my voice.

“It doesn't work that way. You need to say it.”

“Why? Why?! So you can chastise me? So you can talk me out of it? So you can use my dead wife as a talking point to change my mind?!” I screamed, my anger finally boiling over.

“No, Moses. So you can hear how horrible it really is.”

I said nothing. I stared at him in fury, as if he were the avatar of all my problems made manifest. Finally, he spoke to me again.

“Say it.”

Finally, I broke.

“I wanted to see the ocean.”

“No, Moses. Say it. Say it!” he shouted the last two words, making me jump.

“I wanted to kill myself. I wanted to swim out into the sea until I couldn't make it back to shore and let the waves take me under.”

“Why would you want that?”

“So I could be with her again. I want to die in the place where I met her. It seemed... fitting.”

“You thought it would be fitting to taint the single most important place of your relationship with her?”

I didn't have an answer for that. I didn't want to admit it, but in that moment, I could hear how horrible it sounded.

“I'm sorry...” I muttered.

“Why are you sorry?” he asked, making me look at the ground in shame.

“I'm... I'm sorry that I wasn't stronger. I'm sorry that I wanted to give up.”

“It's not me you should apologize to. Right now your son is at home with your mother. What do you think he'd do if he lost both his parents, one right after the other?”

The shame burned my eyes, eliciting fresh tears as I fell to my knees.

“Do you understand why I called you here now? It was never about you, Moses. It was about him, your son. He prayed for you. He prayed to see his father again.”

I felt my breath catch in my throat as the young man touched my elbow to get my attention.

“She loves you. He loves you. You are loved. You're about a day's drive from Corpus Christi. When you get there, you know what you should do and what you shouldn't. Do the right thing.”

I looked up at him, feeling all my anger and fear and sadness evaporate as he gazed at me with a serene expression of what I can only describe as forgiveness.

“What's the right thing to do?”

“You already know, Moses,” he whispered, pulling me into an embrace. “Go there and do the right thing.”

I left soon after that, walking my way back down the hill. The hospital bed and the nooses were both gone, but the little convenience store thing was there. I walked inside and saw the same woman as before standing behind the counter. She smiled at me as I entered.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” she said with a sly grin.

“There's no phone up there...” I said dumbly.

“No, but there was a call waiting for you. I hope you listened.”

I nodded walked back out, not knowing what to say. As I stepped out, I saw the empty bottle of water I had tossed on the ground still laying there. I picked it up and threw it away in the little trashcan outside the shop and went on my way.

I saw my car sitting in the parking area as I approached, the only there. It looked as if it had never been damaged at all. I got in and turned the key, seeing that it had been filled with gas as well. Sitting on the passenger seat was an envelope that I opened, pulling out the handwritten note within.

“Your road takes you to the ocean, but it doesn't end there. Unlike the last Moses I met at The Mountaintop, you will see the promised land.”

I drove down to Corpus Christi, traveling through the small Texas towns and admiring the scenery. Oil rigs and rolling pastures lined the road on either side as the air became fresher. I took the turn headed into Corpus Christi and drove until I was parked beside a bay. There's a little gazebo-like structure there with a plaque about General Travis that overlooks the beach. I met my wife there a long time ago. I pulled the crisp air of the sea into my lungs and steeled myself as I opened the urn I had carried along with me. I kissed it, only hesitating for a moment, before turning it upside down and watching as the wind caught the ashes, pulling them out across the water. I stared for a long time, thinking of her face, memorizing every detail. Then, I turned and walked back to my car. I took another deep breath and started the journey back home to my son.

On the way back, I didn't see any signs pointing to The Mountaintop. That didn't surprise me. I had already answered the call. It would be somewhere else now, being what was needed for whoever needed it.

If you're ever riding down the highway and see signs for The Mountaintop, take notice. And if you turn on the radio and hear someone calling you by name to go, be not afraid.

1iwvv02,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1iwvv02/the_road_spoke_to_me_the_road_to_the_mountaintop/,The road spoke to me (The Road to The Mountaintop),"There's something about being on the open road that just seems to exemplify the concept of freedom itself. When you're riding down an endless stretch of highway with nothing but your thoughts to keep you company, you feel like you can really think. It's not like the rare quiet moments you get in everyday life, it's more prolonged and profound. Maybe that's why I decided to get in my car and drive three days ago.

I had been going down the highway for a long time, only stopping for gas and bathroom breaks, when I finally decided food was necessary as well. It was the dead of night, so there weren't many options, but I finally found a Waffle House sitting conveniently next to the highway. I headed in, being greeted by warm air and the smell of coffee.

I sat down and waited for the waitress to come over and acknowledge me. She was in her thirties, I think, with long brown hair and a bright smile that cut across the room. She flashed that smile in my direction to let me know she was on her way as she finished up with the elderly couple she was helping. It wasn't long before she was handing me a menu that I didn't need to see.

“Hey there, honey. What are you having?” she asked me, each word seeming to drip sweetness.

“Uh, coffee, please,” I muttered.

I've never been a very social person and when it comes to the art of conversation, I'm not much of a aficionado. Still, she either didn't notice or was too polite to let on that she did.

“That's no problem, I'll have it out in just a moment. So where you headed?” she said while retrieving a cup and a pot of coffee from the counter.

“I'm just headed out west for now,” I replied, not knowing quite how to answer that question.

“I thought you were going to say you were headed out to the Mountain Top,” she laughed.

“There's a mountain out this way?”

“No, not a real mountain, that's just the name of place. They call it The Mountain Top because people go there to talk to God.”

She poured a cup of coffee and I took a long sip before continuing.

“They go there to talk to God?”

“Something like that. I've never been, myself, but people are headed up there all the time.”

“Sounds kind of... crazy, you know?”

“Maybe. But people head up there all the time anyways.”

I looked over at the elderly couple sitting on the other side of the diner.

“What about them? Are they headed to The Mountain Top?”

“Yep. Like I said, every headed down this road is usually going there. You might be one of the first people I've ever seen that isn't,” she said, her big smile starting to unnerve me a little.

“Well, I've never even heard of the place,” I told her, taking another drink of the coffee.

“You have now, sugar. The Mountain Top is just about a day's ride out further west. You'll probably pass it. Lord knows you can't miss all the signs they have pointing it out.”

I shrugged and fell into the silence I had become so accustomed to as of late. Talking felt like it took more energy than it used to, and I wanted to save every bit of it for the road ahead.

I thought that would be the end of it, but she said one more thing to me when I went to pay the check.

“Thanks for dropping in. You should go to The Mountain Top. I think it's where you need to be right now.”

I didn't respond, just gave a shy smile and walked out to my car. The way she had insisted didn't sit right with me. I was more determined than ever to drive right past that place and hoped this would be the last I heard of it.

If only it had been that easy.

I got back in my car and flicked on the radio, hoping something other than droning of my engine and tires would aid in keeping me awake and alert. There wasn't much out here in the way of radio stations, mostly gospel music and a classical station. However, there was one that came through clear of a man who spoke in a low but kindly voice.

“Hey there, all you weary travelers. I'll be taking calls for the next few minutes to answer any questions you may have. Go ahead caller, you're on the air.”

“Hello?” came the elderly voice of a woman.

“Yes mam, go ahead with your question.”

“Yes, I'm headed to The Mountain Top right now and just wanted to know if I needed to bring anything along.”

The radio DJ laughed a little.

“No, all you need is your questions. Questions and a little bit of faith. Go ahead, next caller, you're on.”

The next voice was a young woman.

“Hi, Nate! I was just wondering about the trials, what happens if we fail?”

“Don't worry, we all fail. The only trial that really matters is how determined you are to keep trying. Let's take one more. You're on with Nate, go ahead.”

This last one was a man's voice. He sounded tired.

“Yea, what would you say to a doubter? Like, someone who doesn't want to go to The Mountaintop even though it's calling them?”

Nate sighed heavily through the microphone.

“If they're called, it doesn't matter. They'll end up there one way or another. Okay, that's enough questions for now. Before we go to some music, we have a special message for Moses Pearson.”

I almost slammed on the brakes when I heard my name being spoken over the radio.

“Moses, I know you're listening right now. You need to know that The Mountaintop is calling you. The next few days are going to be pretty intense for you. You got to let go and go with it. You're not meant to get to the place you're going. You're meant to get to The Mountaintop. Happy trails, friend.”

Maybe it was meant for someone else with my same name. There was probably a perfectly reasonable explanation for it, like the waitress calling up the radio after seeing me in the Waffle House. No, that couldn't be it, I'd never told her my name. Regardless, I was certain this was all some kind of trick, an elaborate hoax to play on unsuspecting tourists. Either way, I wasn't going to The Mountaintop.

I kept driving for quite a while after that, maybe two or three hours. My eyes were getting heavy and fatigue was starting to set in. I knew I'd have to pull over to sleep soon, whether I wanted to keep going or not. Thankfully, I saw a sign for a motel rearing over the highway in the distance.

“The Midian Inn, exit in four miles.”

I had been anticipating sleeping in my car that evening, so I was pretty relieved to see another option all the way out here. I pulled off the highway when I reached the exit and drove up the only building for miles around.

There was a sign with the words “Midian Inn” standing next to the little drive way up to the office area. I parked and approached, spying an old man sitting behind a pane of glass at the front area. He had been reading a book as I approached, but put it down when he saw me.

“Good evening, mister,” he greeted me once I was within earshot. “I take it you'll be wanting a room?”

“Yea, I just need one bed. It's just me.”

“We can do that.”

I paid the man and he handed me a key with a tag attached that displayed the room number: 215.

“Okay, check out is at eleven in the morning tomorrow. Make sure to get something to eat when you wake up, it'll be your last chance before doing the first trial.”

“First trial?” I asked, getting a sinking feeling in my stomach as he smiled.

“The first trial of The Mountaintop. That's where you're headed, isn't it?”

“No... I'm just passing through,” I said, swallowing my irritation.

“My apologies, mister. Where are you headed, if you're not going there?”

“I'm headed to Corpus Christi, in Texas. For some reason, my GPS picked this route, so this is the way I'm headed.”

“That's awful strange, but the highway will lead there eventually, if that's where you want to go.”

I was about to turn to walk away, but stopped and asked the question I had been trying to push down the whole time.

“What is The Mountaintop anyways?”

“Depends on who you ask. Some people think they can go there to talk to God, others think that it's a pilgrimage site or something. Over the years, I've arrived at the conclusion that it's different things to different people at different times.”

“You mean you've never been?”

“Oh, I've been a few times, but it was different each time. The first time I went, it was just a section of forest with nothing there but a hot spring. The second time, it was a some kind of church. The last time I went there was to scatter my wife's ashes. It was a graveyard that time. I don't know if they change location every so often or something. The road leading up to it has so many twists and turns that it's hard to remember if it's in the same place or not.”

“Well, I'm not headed that way. I'm just trying to get to Corpus Christi. Still, it does sound interesting.”

The old man smiled and went back to his book, giving me the cue to head to my room. I opened the door and looked around at the hotel room which seemed to have been a snapshot of the early eighties. The décor was dated and the carpet was shaggy, making me feel a little nostalgic as I kicked off my shoes and settled into the bed. I knew sleep would come pretty quickly, so I didn't bother taking a shower. I'd save that for the morning.

That night, I dreamed about my wife. In my dream, she was sitting next to the bed, leaning over me and brushing my hair out of my face. She didn't say anything, just smiled at me reassuringly. She leaned in and kissed my forehead just as I woke up.

I took a shower and got dressed. I was anxious to be back on the road and didn't want to waste any time, so I immediately went to go check out. I walked to the little office area and was surprised to see the same old man that I had checked in with last night. I figured it would have been someone else in the morning, but he was smiling at me as I approached.

“Sleep well?” he asked as I slid him back the key.

“Yea, I think I'm ready to get back on the road now.”

“You still think you're going to Corpus Christi?” he asked, making me feel a little uneasy.

“Yea, that's still my destination,” I answered with a nervous laugh.

“Yea, Jonah thought he was going to go somewhere too. That was before the whale got him,” the old man responded with a smile.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“I mean, you have a good trip, Moses.”

“How do you know my name?” I responded, anger creeping into my voice.

“You've been called,” was the only thing he said, before looking down to his book, which I could see was a copy of Moby Dick.

I probably should have asked more questions in that moment, but instead, I walked away. I was anxious to get away from this place quickly, unable to shake the feeling that I was in some kind of danger. The sooner I saw The Mountaintop disappearing into my rear view, the better.

As the Midian Inn disappeared behind me, I thought about how the old man had learned my name and decided he probably saw my ID in my wallet when I went to pay him last night. Another happenstance that can be completely explained a way with rationality. It's such a shame that I didn't accept that. The whole thing just felt off, like some massive cult was documenting my movements and keeping tabs on me. Either way, it was nothing distance couldn't solve, so I set myself to putting as much distance between myself and all this as I could.

The minutes crept by as the sound of my tires spinning on the road became the only thing I could hear. I had been struggling with the urge to turn on my radio again, simultaneously worried that I'd hear the DJ speaking to me again and curious of what this was all really about. Eventually, I gave in to curiosity and turned the dial.

“This is Nate saying good morning to all you listeners from The Moutaintop! We're going to take some calls before going back to the music. Caller, you're on the air with Nate.”

“Hi, Nate!” came a young lady's voice, bubbly and full of excitement. “I just wanted to say that I just left the Mountaintop and it was amazing! What happens if someone is called there and doesn't go?”

“Good question, mam. It doesn't matter if someone wants to go or not when they're called, they'll end up there one way or another. The Mountaintop isn't something you can just ignore, after all. Next caller, you're on!”

“Hey Nate, what is the Mountaintop anyways?” came the voice of a young man.

“The Mountaintop is something that's hard to explain, but I'll do my best. It's where God touches creation. We're all sinners and we're all lost, but He guides us back to the path, and The Mountaintop is like the part of a compass that faces north. Next caller, go ahead!”

“Hey Nate, I just wanted to send a shout out to Moses! He's on his way to The Mountaintop right now, even though I think he's going to try to run. Do you think you can give him some words of encouragement?”

I recognized that voice. It was the old man from the inn.

“Moses, I know you're listening. You're headed down the highway right now, probably scared and confused. All the answers you need are waiting for you at The Mountaintop. Be not afraid. You know who said that? Gabriel, when he told Mary Jesus was on His way. He told that to Joseph when he feared to take Mary for his wife. He said it to Paul when he feared he'd be shipwrecked. Well, Moses, keep your eyes and ears open, because Gabriel is going to say it to you. Be not afraid.”

As if on cue, I saw a large billboard rising over the road, a plain white rectangle with large black words printed across it.

“Be not afraid.”

I slammed down on the gas, my heart racing. Despite the commandment of the billboard, I don't think I've ever been more terrified in my life.

I sped along, the radio switching for speech to the sounds of smooth jazz. I didn't have an explanation for what was happening, and I didn't try to rationalize it anymore. I just knew I wanted to run as fast as I could to get the hell out here.

It was another hour or two down the road that I saw the large sign telling me that the next exit would lead me to the first trial of The Mountaintop. For some reason, I just knew that if I blew past that exit, I'd be home free. So I pressed down on the accelerator, my car jumping forward as it gained speed. I glanced at the speedometer and saw I was going over a hundred miles an hour. The exit blurred past me and I grinned. I finally felt like I had escaped. That's when I saw something on the road up ahead and slammed on my brakes.

Too late.

I managed to slow my car down, but I still smashed into the thing going about forty miles an hour. It was a miracle I wasn't injured, but my car wasn't so lucky. I climbed out and looked at the front and saw both the front tires has burst and been shredded by the plastic of whatever it was I crashed into. It was something big, a large plastic thing laying in the middle of the highway. I walked around to get a better look at it and almost fainted when I finally realized what I was laying my eyes on.

It was a giant plastic figurine of a whale.

I climbed back into my car and cranked it, momentarily determined to drive it on the shredded tires all the way to the next exit, but it sputtered and didn't turn over. I cursed and climbed back out, pulling out my cellphone and noticing I didn't have any signal in the area. So calling a towtruck wasn't going to work.

I started walking forward eventually, deciding I'd get to the next exit and call from there. The sun beat down from overhead, drawing beads of precious moisture from my brow and burning my skin. It was a hard journey, but I was determined to get to the next exit and stay away from The Mountaintop.

I'd walked for three hours, the sun arcing along and assaulting me every step of the way. As I saw an exit looming in the distance, however, I felt renewed vigor and picked up my pace. That pace slowed to a halt when I saw the sign over the exit.

“The Mountaintop, first trial.”

I didn't understand how it could have been possible, but I was looking at the same exit I had just driven past earlier. If I strained my eyes, I could even make out my car still smashed halfway into the plastic whale in the distance. I thought about triying to walk away again, but thirst won out over my desire to flee. I started walking towards The Mountaintop.

The exit led to a neat little parking lot devoid of cars. I remember getting nervous that there would be no one there, but still took the little dirt road leading into the wooded area ahead. I was thankful for the trees blocking the unforgiving sun as I walked along, giving some respite to my sunburned skin and sweat drenched body. After walking for a few minutes, I spotted a small, squat wooden building ahead. It looked almost like a cross between a log cabin and a convenience store. I arrived at the entrance and pulled open the door, breathing a sigh of relief as I was greeted by the cold air. I had half expected it to be locked.

Inside was even more like a convenience store, with coolers housing drinks and aisles of various goods. However, none of them were familiar to me. There were bags of what I thought were chips labeled “Manna” and bottles of water with brand name “Siloam.” It was all very strange, as was the young black lady behind the counter.

“Congratulations on making it through the first trial!” she greeted me.

“What are you talking about?” I asked, grabbing a bottle of the water and bringing it to the counter.

“You made it through the desert. That's the first trial,” she explained.

I didn't respond, feeling too tired, and pulled out my wallet to pay for the water.

“Oh, you don't need to pay. That's yours,” she said, pushing the bottle towards me.

I looked at her warily, but unscrewed the lid and drank most of it in several greedy gulps. I've never heard of Siloam Water, but I think it was the sweetest water I've ever tasted in my life.

“You ready for the second trial?” she asked, smiling kindly at me.

“Actually, I just need to use your phone and the number for a towing company,” I shot back with an irritated look.

“For your car down the road? It's already been picked up and is getting repaired. It will be back here when you're done. That'll be after you reach The Mountaintop though.”

“I'm not going.”

“Sugar, you don't have a choice. You've been called.”

“Listen here, you crazy bitch, I'm not going to your stupid clubhouse or whatever it is!”

She looked completely unfazed by my outburst, which in turn, made me feel downright terrified.

“Look at you, Moses, so quick to get back on that road. Where you headed anyways? What's at the end of that road for you? You think your wife is waiting for you down in Corpus Christi?”

Her voice was kind and dripping with a tone of sympathy, but her words only served to anger me. Yet, even more than anger, they scared me.

“Shut up...” was all I can manage to say.

“Get yourself on up the road to the second trial. I'm sure they have a phone you can use.”

I started to turn to head out the door, when she whistled to get my attention and I turned back, just in time to catch another bottle of water she tossed at me.

“And while you're at it Moses, maybe watch your mouth?”

I didn't respond and stormed back out the door. The path stretched further along going a little uphill. I downed the rest of the first bottle and threw it on the ground. It seemed ridiculous, but if littering was the best revenge I could muster in this moment, then I'd take it.

I started walking up the hill, looking for the next building or whatever the hell it was. As I walked, I felt my fear and anger ebb away, being too exhausted from everything happening to maintain such heightened emotions. Instead, I allowed myself to sink into a comfortable misery. The wooded area pressed in from all sides, and as I walked, I spotted what looked like a noose hanging from a tree. Then another. Soon, I was wading through a sea of them.

I should of felt afraid by such threatening imagery, but instead, I felt... sadness. More sadness than I could possibly put into words. Towards the end of the path was a ladder heading up a tree to one of the nooses, and I thought hard about climbing it. I walked up and rested a hand against the wooden plank nailed there and closed my eyes.

“Feeling lost, stranger?”

I jumped and looked behind me to see an man with a thick beard looking at me with an amused expression.

“Uh, yea, I'm looking for a phone.”

The man laughed, a cheerful juxtaposition in the midst of the nooses.

“Oh Lord! I don't think you'll find a phone up there!”

“Listen, I just want to get out of here.”

His tone changed from mirth to a hardened seriousness as he eyed me, looking me fully up and down in a way that made me want to squirm.

“No, you want peace.”

I opened my mouth to protest, but found myself unable to speak.

“You want peace and you won't find that up there either,” he said with a wary glance towards the top of the ladder.

“Where would I find it then?” I asked, tears welling in my eyes.

“You already know. You just need to quit running from it.”

I closed my eyes, feeling the tears roll down my cheeks as I sucked in a labored breath.

“I just need to go. I need to get back on the road.”

“You're on it, stranger. You just have to keep walking it.”

I felt a sudden rush of anger and rounded on him to scream. I wanted to scream that he was a moron. I wanted to hit him with all my strength. I wanted to release all the frustration boiling inside me in that moment, but when I opened my eyes and spun around, he was gone.

I looked around, wondering where he had disappeared to, but there was no one there. I did see a path leading deeper into the woods though, and decided to take that.

I walked along, leaving the rope laden trees behind me and pushed forward. I walked for a long time, eventually seeing the trees thin away as I breached a clearing, then almost fell to my knees.

There, in the middle of the clearing, as a hospital bed. I recognized it immediately, having spent enough time beside one. I approached it and collapsed to my knees, burying my face into the linen sheets and stifling a sob.

“You miss her.”

I didn't look up, just froze there. The sheets even smelled like her. I felt a hand touch my shoulder, gently resting there as the female voice continued.

“What do you think she'd say if she knew where you were going.”

“She can't say anything,” I responded, lifting my head up a little. “She's dead.”

“That's not what I asked you, Moses. Stop running from the answer.”

Maybe it was the motherly way she spoke to me, but I just couldn't rouse myself into the anger I had felt earlier. Instead, I answered her question.

“She'd say I was being a fool. That I was being selfish.”

“No, Moses. She'd say that you are loved. And you are.”

I looked up then, seeing a middle aged woman with a face full of mercy. She smiled at me and brushed my hair back the same way my wife used to.

“She'd say she misses you. She'd say you are strong enough to keep going, even if you don't believe it. Most importantly, she'd say she loves you and always will.”

I cried, tears rolling down my cheeks, then buried my head into the sheets that smelled of her again.

“I'm sorry...” I muttered, but when I looked up, the woman was gone. The sun was setting and there was a trail across the clearing that I knew I had to walk. So I got up, my heart still aching, and walked towards it.

I didn't have far to walk. Just a little bit ahead was the top of the hill, stones paving the summit in a neat circle. An old fashioned well stood atop the center, which I approached cautiously. For some reason, the well filled me with a deep sense of foreboding. I was a few feet away from it when a new voice called out to me.

“Don't get too close to it, Moses.”

I turned to see a young man with long hair standing there. He must have been in his mid twenties, his face calm and serene as he strode towards me.

“You know, this well usually isn't here. It's usually in a small town on a midwestern farm, tormenting a family that grows corn there. It's a long story.”

“Why am I here?” I asked, exhausted.

“Because I called you, Moses,” the young man said, pulling a piece of meat from his pocket and tossing it into the well. “We all face monsters in our lives. Some of those monsters are like this well, something tangible and providing an exterior threat. Most of us will never have to deal with anything like that. Most of us will have to battle interior threats, which are far more dangerous. Why are you going to Corpus Christi?”

“If you are who I think you are, then you already know,” I answered, hearing my anger creeping into my voice.

“It doesn't work that way. You need to say it.”

“Why? Why?! So you can chastise me? So you can talk me out of it? So you can use my dead wife as a talking point to change my mind?!” I screamed, my anger finally boiling over.

“No, Moses. So you can hear how horrible it really is.”

I said nothing. I stared at him in fury, as if he were the avatar of all my problems made manifest. Finally, he spoke to me again.

“Say it.”

Finally, I broke.

“I wanted to see the ocean.”

“No, Moses. Say it. Say it!” he shouted the last two words, making me jump.

“I wanted to kill myself. I wanted to swim out into the sea until I couldn't make it back to shore and let the waves take me under.”

“Why would you want that?”

“So I could be with her again. I want to die in the place where I met her. It seemed... fitting.”

“You thought it would be fitting to taint the single most important place of your relationship with her?”

I didn't have an answer for that. I didn't want to admit it, but in that moment, I could hear how horrible it sounded.

“I'm sorry...” I muttered.

“Why are you sorry?” he asked, making me look at the ground in shame.

“I'm... I'm sorry that I wasn't stronger. I'm sorry that I wanted to give up.”

“It's not me you should apologize to. Right now your son is at home with your mother. What do you think he'd do if he lost both his parents, one right after the other?”

The shame burned my eyes, eliciting fresh tears as I fell to my knees.

“Do you understand why I called you here now? It was never about you, Moses. It was about him, your son. He prayed for you. He prayed to see his father again.”

I felt my breath catch in my throat as the young man touched my elbow to get my attention.

“She loves you. He loves you. You are loved. You're about a day's drive from Corpus Christi. When you get there, you know what you should do and what you shouldn't. Do the right thing.”

I looked up at him, feeling all my anger and fear and sadness evaporate as he gazed at me with a serene expression of what I can only describe as forgiveness.

“What's the right thing to do?”

“You already know, Moses,” he whispered, pulling me into an embrace. “Go there and do the right thing.”

I left soon after that, walking my way back down the hill. The hospital bed and the nooses were both gone, but the little convenience store thing was there. I walked inside and saw the same woman as before standing behind the counter. She smiled at me as I entered.

“Did you find what you were looking for?” she said with a sly grin.

“There's no phone up there...” I said dumbly.

“No, but there was a call waiting for you. I hope you listened.”

I nodded walked back out, not knowing what to say. As I stepped out, I saw the empty bottle of water I had tossed on the ground still laying there. I picked it up and threw it away in the little trashcan outside the shop and went on my way.

I saw my car sitting in the parking area as I approached, the only there. It looked as if it had never been damaged at all. I got in and turned the key, seeing that it had been filled with gas as well. Sitting on the passenger seat was an envelope that I opened, pulling out the handwritten note within.

“Your road takes you to the ocean, but it doesn't end there. Unlike the last Moses I met at The Mountaintop, you will see the promised land.”

I drove down to Corpus Christi, traveling through the small Texas towns and admiring the scenery. Oil rigs and rolling pastures lined the road on either side as the air became fresher. I took the turn headed into Corpus Christi and drove until I was parked beside a bay. There's a little gazebo-like structure there with a plaque about General Travis that overlooks the beach. I met my wife there a long time ago. I pulled the crisp air of the sea into my lungs and steeled myself as I opened the urn I had carried along with me. I kissed it, only hesitating for a moment, before turning it upside down and watching as the wind caught the ashes, pulling them out across the water. I stared for a long time, thinking of her face, memorizing every detail. Then, I turned and walked back to my car. I took another deep breath and started the journey back home to my son.

On the way back, I didn't see any signs pointing to The Mountaintop. That didn't surprise me. I had already answered the call. It would be somewhere else now, being what was needed for whoever needed it.

If you're ever riding down the highway and see signs for The Mountaintop, take notice. And if you turn on the radio and hear someone calling you by name to go, be not afraid.

1iwvu2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kafka/comments/1iwvu2d/joe_k_part_7/,Joe K - Part 7,"Over the following weeks, the potential repercussions of K's actions, and the actions of others on his behalf, made him so nervous and paranoid he became a virtual prisoner in his own flat. He'd already told Clean Knows that he wouldn't be available for a while, for unspecified health reasons, so the only time he ventured outside was to pick up books from the public library, where he successfully avoided the temptation to google himself. After the embarrassing episode at Broker's house, they'd agreed that the waters were far too choppy for a newbie to start surfing in. Even so, he barely made it back to his flat, breathing heavily and on the verge of a panic attack, convinced that everyone was looking at him. Everywhere he looked, he'd see them all on their mobile phones, texting each other in an invisible conversation all about him, that he wasn't involved in. And then there were those CCTV cameras - why were they always pointing at him? He imagined there was one guy operating all the cameras, one all-seeing eye whose only job was to observe his every movement, like he was Patrick McGoohan in the 1960's television show, *The Prisoner*.

To re-establish his foothold in reality, he tried, as if it would make any difference, to weigh up the pros and cons of the two approaches to his case - Broker or Ohm? journalist or lawyer? tennis or football? Was he really just a tool of statistical manipulation? What kind of exposure and attention did Broker's plan threaten to unleash on him? Would aligning himself with a xenophobic politician make his father turn in his grave? Would aligning himself with a gynophobic lawyer make his mother turn in her grave? Would maligning a homophobic - and possibly transphobic - policeman make K turn in his grave? Was he actually offended though, really? He wished he could talk to Katie about all this but she hadn't been around since he'd offended her on the night of his arrest. When he'd found his battered old copy of *Gravity's Rainbow* on his doorstep he'd taken it as an act of forgiveness and reconciliation, but now it seemed like a 760-page long line under their relationship. Whatever that relationship was, he'd blown it, and there was nobody else he could talk to - Chief Inspector Dee was right, he had no friends. He used to have friends, in his youth, but they'd all drifted away. They'd got married, started families, started careers and got new, more appropriate, friends. He hadn't put up a fight, he understood that normal people needed normal relationships with other normal people, especially if they wanted to raise a family, so he settled for a series of casual acquaintances and slowly metamorphosed into a 'virtual nonentity.'

When he finally made the call, the Yorkshireman answered and moaned for fifteen minutes about potholes, VAR and the price of tomato soup. K hung up. Ten minutes later, Zephyr phoned back and they arranged to meet at the Black Bottom. ""I don't want any trouble from you,"" the proprietress calmly and matter-of-factly warned Zephyr in a warm Irish accent, as he walked in, scanned the room and found K sat alone in the Charles Mingus Booth.

""A grilled cheese sandwich and a Coke, when you're ready, Ma,"" he said, removing his hood and treating her warning like a form of address he'd become used to, perhaps even expected. He walked over and took a seat opposite K, who was trying, and failing, to spot any family resemblance. For a start, she still had all her teeth. She was a big, buxom woman with beautiful red hair and brown eyes. He was a small, thin man with dirty brown hair and red eyes. Her long dress and folk jewellery gave her a rural look that was the antithesis of Zephyr's urban underworld appearance. As it turned out, they were no relation. ""Everyone 'round here knows Ma,"" he explained. ""Where are you from, anyway?""

""'Round here.""

""And you've never been in the Bottom?""

""That's funny, Ohm asked me the same thing. I've been in here a few times over the years, but I do seem to be becoming a bit of regular these days."" Under Zephyr's interrogation of who, where and when, it turned out that K vaguely remembered Ulysses Rheaney as the leader of a motley crew of wannabe revolutionaries - including his father - back in the 1980s, plotting the inevitable rise of socialism, perhaps at the very same table his daughter was now serving his new companion a grilled cheese sandwich and a can of Coke.

""Socialism,"" scoffed Zephyr.

""Not a fan, then?""

""It's a great idea, but They'll never let it happen. I mean, if They were going to scrap capitalism, They'd have done it after the tulip crisis in the seventeenth century. It was pretty obvious, even then, that whole idea was severely flawed, but, once you've got an economy that creates more wealth for the already wealthy at the expense of everyone else, nobody with the power to change it is ever going to have the will to do so, are they? Nowadays, the invisible hand is so busy wanking itself to death, I doubt They could stop it, even if They did suddenly grow a conscience. Wherever there's money to be made, money's being made - you've got the military-industrial complex, medical capitalism, disaster capitalism, surveillance capitalism. Soon, everyone of us will be tracked everywhere we go and a credit system will control our behaviour. Criticise the state and you'll get less credit, report someone else for criticising the state and you'll get more credit. Lose credit and you'll lose access to public services, employment opportunities, healthcare, childcare, leisure facilities, dating opportunities. They're already doing this in China and they're the fastest growing economy in the world - do you think the rest of the world is going to let China win? Of course, the real problem is that this is all short-term thinking - the capitalist system is functionally incapable of dealing with the long-term, that's why the economy keeps crashing. Some form of international socialism is the only way to even begin to seriously tackle something like climate change, for example. But, like I said, They'll never let it happen. Do you know why the first world war started?""

""I'm aware that the answer typically revolves around the geopolitical climate in Europe at the time, the various alliances..."" Serving at a nearby table, Ma was giving K a ""please don't encourage him"" look.

""Meaningless agreements that nobody took seriously at the time and never would have been used to justify the actions that were taken.""

""Well, after more than a century of scholarly debate, I guess it will always remain an unresolved question."" This time, Ma's look said - ""Nice try, you'll have to do better than that.""

""Sometimes a question remains unresolved because the answer that's staring you right in the fucking face is too unacceptable to deal with, so let's cut through all the bullshit and deal with it.""

""Hey!"" Ma interjected, in a admonishing tone that suited her matriarchal epithet, making K aware of just how loud and animated the young man had suddenly become. Zephyr apologised and took a hungry bite from his grilled cheese sandwich. He leaned a little closer to K and lowered his voice to conspiratorial half-whisper.

""Picture the scene - it's Western Europe in early twentieth century and, inspired by the age of enlightenment, the ruling classes have come to see themselves as great social reformers. They've got it into their heads that an educated workforce is a more efficient workforce, so they've decided to teach a generation of poor people to read and write. This turns out to be a big mistake. If they can read, they can read Marx and Engels, if they can write, they can write about socialism and anarchism. All over Europe, angry young men are demanding equality...""

""And women - don't forget the suffragettes.""

""The suffragettes were a bunch of sexual repressed rich women who wanted revenge on their limp-dicked husbands. Do you really think poor women were marching in the streets, demanding the right to work down a coal mine for sixteen hours a day and die of lung cancer when they're 25? The real problem, for the deep state, wasn't women throwing themselves in front of horses, it was men - *and* women - throwing bombs at the rich and powerful. It was the age of assassination and things were getting out of hand, too many leaders were getting killed and revolution was in the air. What could they do? pacification? - cinema and television and pop music were still decades away. When Archduke Ferdinand got assassinated it was the final straw. Three cousins had a family meeting - the Emperor of Britannia, the King of Germany and the Tzar of Russia. One question - how do we stop all these angry young men trying to kill us? One answer - we get them to kill each other.""

""If that's true, it didn't quite work out, did it? They still had a revolution in Russia, and Germany ended up with the Third Reich.""

""That's because Britannia double-crossed Germany and made a new deal with the power-hungry Amerikans. They inadvertently hastened the communist takeover of Russia, then let Hitler take over Germany to stop the same thing happening there. Britannia always plays the long game, they're the real thousand-year Reich. Their deep state is the deepest state there is - apart from the Vatican, of course. Russia, China, France, they've all had revolutions, but even when Britannia chopped King Charles' head off, they still left all the real power structures in place.""

""You should write this down.""

""I did, in a paper I wrote at university, with evidence and citations and all that shit. A week later I was kicked off the course for 'smoking a joint'. So, how's your case going?"" K told him about his arrest and interrogation. He was too ashamed to mention the whole ""giant insect in a dress"" thing and left out all the Broker stuff for fear of it getting back to Ohm. ""I wouldn't stress about it too much,"" advised Zephyr. ""Old Foster will get you out of this, he's the best.""

""I just wish I knew what it was I'm supposed to have done wrong.""

""Well, that's obvious - you're a nihilist,"" said Zephyr, using a burp as an exclamation point.

""Why does everyone keep saying that? And, even if it's true, it doesn't make me dangerous.""

""It does to Them. To Them it's the scariest thing there is - much scarier than a terrorist. They can label a terrorist, They can understand a terrorist, They can fight a terrorist, and, when the time is right, They can use a terrorist. But a nihilist is an unknown quantity, and there's nothing more scary than the unknown.""

""So what do They want? to get to know me? Why don't They just buy me a pint?""

""They don't want to know you, They want to control you, like They want to control everyone else, like They always have. But now they have the technology to do so, and they have the most lucrative commodity on the market right where They want them - an entire generation of living dollar-bills sleepwalking into a totalitarian nightmare. People will soon be queuing up to have microchips implanted in their brains until everyone's telepathically linked together with no individual thoughts of their own. But They're making a big mistake. Heidegger said, 'In its essence, technology is something that man does not control', and he was right.""

""He was also a boozy beggar.""

""He was also a fucking Nazi, but that's not the point.""

""What *is* the point?""

""Aren't you listening? - control. They're controlling people through the information they upload onto the internet, through their mobile phones and computers and all the other so-called smart technology They're forcing on everyone. But you don't have a any of that, and that's probably why They arrested you - because the more They know about the majority the more afraid They become of the minority that They don't know anything about. Your arrest proves that the clampdown on free, private citizens has already started. I'll have to upload some content on this.""

""Upload? But...""

""I guarantee your anonymity.""

""It's a bit late for that, I'm just surprised you have a computer.""

""I don't - I only ever use public computers in lots of different locations. I cover my tracks and try to stay in the shadows. It's still risky, but people have a right to know the truth. I do all the big ones - AI, secret societies, secret agendas, symbolism, hidden messages, JFK, 9/11, false flags, fake shootings, fake wars, fake viruses, chem trails..."" K started to tune out. That's what happens if you try to make friends, he thought, you end up having coffee with a fucking cocoa bean - and I came out to try and feel *less* paranoid. He wished he'd invited the Yorkshireman out now. At least the rising price of groceries was something he could relate to. Which brands have been poisoned with chemical castration agents, not so much.

K caught Ma's eye at a nearby table and rolled his own. The looked she returned was full of sympathy and empathy, but it also said - ""Sorry, love, I've done all I can, you're on your own now, you're just going to have to ride this one out."" In fairness, it looked like she had her own situation to deal with. The woman opposite her was visibly upset and unloading whatever troubles she had onto the patient, understanding shoulders of the coffee house proprietress. You don't get that kind of service in a Culo Nero. K reluctantly took his gaze away from Ma and tuned back into whatever lecture was being delivered by his latest casual acquaintance. ""...seen proof that he was created by the CIA and Facebook. I mean think about it, it's the only explanation. Sure, there's been commercially manufactured pop music since the 1950s, I get that. Sure, capitalism has swallowed all the great creative, cultural movements of the twentieth century - rock 'n' roll, punk, hip hop... all of it - and shat out bland, repetitive, consumerist, soul-destroying shite over the masses. But this is on a whole other level. How can someone *so* talentless and *so* ugly and *so* uncharismatic become one of the biggest selling musical acts in history. It *has* to be an experiment in brainwashing - let's take the worst busker we can find on the street and see how popular we can make him. And all they did was post a few videos, create a load of fake profiles of teenagers saying how great he is and let human nature do the rest. What do teenagers want more than anything?... Popularity, of course. They don't want to miss out on the latest big thing and they want everyone to know that they get it, that they're in with the in crowd. The experiment worked, so They ran with it, and it became more successful than They ever imagined. The really scary thing, now They know how easily They can manipulate young minds, is what are They going to do next? what have They already started doing? After MK-Ultra and all the other failed experiments They did in the sixties and seventies, They've finally got the 'perfect drug' They've been waiting for - social media."" Zephyr finally had to stop to let out a big burp and K didn't want to miss the opportunity to change the subject.

""How's your case going?""

""I've got a trial date.""

""Do you think you'll win?""

""Ha! The house always wins, didn't anyone ever tell you that? You expose a satanic paedophile ring and they come and arrest *you* \- what a world! Old Foster will work his magic though - a bit of community service, maybe a small fine that'll pay for itself in online revenue - and before you know it, I'll be back in the shadows fighting for truth and justice - someone's got to do it."" Shit, thought K, this guy actually thinks he's a superhero. Shit, thought K, this guy actually has my phone number. Whatever future plans Zephyr had for saving the world, he wasn't feeling heroic enough to pick up his share of the tab, siting issues with his benefit payments. ""Have you seen all the pointless, stressful shit they make you do? all for a measly pittance you can't afford to live on, anyway - it drives you mental. And then they've got the fucking nerve to offer you mental health services to help with you cope with the problems they've fucking caused in the first place. Shit, if they just gave you the money instead of spending it on the pointless shit and the mental health services they'd probably save a fortune.""

Walking back home, K felt more paranoid than ever, mainly regarding Zephyr. Although seeing someone that confused and self-deluded had made him appreciate just how relatively normal he was, he might also have placed himself in more real danger than could possibly be caused by a simple legal misunderstanding. There was no telling what kind of potential threat was posed by someone as unhinged as that, especially if he happened to stumbled across all the stuff people were saying about him on the internet. By the time he'd got to Malevich Square, he'd promised himself two things. First, he'd stay away from Zephyr and any other crazies his unusual case might attract. Second, he'd keep a close watch on his own mental state, eschew his anxiety, double down on his pragmatism and allow the future to come to him.",1,1740379434.0,Kafka,0,1.0,False

Protein milk has gained significant popularity among health enthusiasts and those looking to enhance their nutritional intake. This specialized beverage is enriched with protein, making it an ideal choice for athletes, bodybuilders, and anyone aiming to maintain a balanced diet. The protein content in these milk products can come from various sources, including whey, casein, or plant-based proteins, catering to diverse dietary preferences.

One of the key benefits of protein milk is its ability to support muscle recovery and growth. The amino acids present in the protein help repair muscle tissues after intense workouts, reducing recovery time and promoting muscle development. Incorporating protein milk into your post-workout routine can enhance your athletic performance and overall fitness.

Another advantage of protein milk is its satiety factor. With its higher protein content compared to regular milk, it can help you feel fuller for longer, which may aid in weight management. Those looking to lose or maintain weight can benefit from including protein milk in their diet, as it helps curb cravings and prevents overeating.

Moreover, protein milk is versatile and can be consumed in various ways. Whether mixed into smoothies, added to coffee, or enjoyed as a standalone drink, its rich taste and creamy texture make it an appealing option. Additionally, many brands offer flavored varieties, such as chocolate or vanilla, enriching the experience for consumers.

For individuals with dietary restrictions, protein milk alternatives are readily available. Plant-based options, such as almond, soy, or pea protein milk, provide similar nutritional benefits without the lactose found in traditional dairy products. This ensures that everyone can enjoy the benefits of protein milk, regardless of dietary preferences.

Incorporating protein milk into your daily routine can lead to improved energy levels, better muscle recovery, and enhanced overall health. As you explore the choices available, consider how this nutrient-rich beverage can support your personal health goals.

1iwvqa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iwvqa6/breville_bambino_is_outputting_water_too_fast/,Breville Bambino is outputting water too fast [Breville Bambino],"My bambino is producing too much water from the group head too fast, not the portafilter. The shot will be on a good pace to produce 38-40g of espresso in 30s from 18gs of coffee in, but then just shut off around 25 seconds and below my desired extraction weight. There will also be a pool of water on top of the puck, but the puck is nice and compact. This all started after I descaled and cleaned the machine one day without an issue before. 

If I run the machine w/o a portafilter or grounds, it will complete a cycle in 20 seconds. Before the issue while pulling a shot, a full cycle would take about 35-40 seconds, and never stop before producing my desired output (I usually pull the shot out at my desired output and let the machine finish into the drip tray). 

So I am thinking this issue has something to do with not enough pressure/resistance going back to the group head. Not enough is allowing the group head to let water flow too quickly. I am just not sure how to resolve this as I said the extractions have been on a good pace, with grinding finer producing over extracted slow shots. 

I am using a DF54 with quality beans, so that is not the issue. I also had no issues with these beans before doing the cleaning descale cycle.

[$2,000]","So I haven’t pulled a shot in over 20 years and after reading through this community’s posts for the last month, I can tell I may never have pulled a proper shot. I was a bartenderista at a Steakhouse in Portland Oregon. What’s funny is that the first Stumptown was opened across the street and it opened my eyes to what coffee could taste like. I could pull shots anytime behind the bar but I would pay for Stumptown any chance I could get. 

Fast forward to being a middle-aged man who’s Nespresso has finally taken a dump and I’m excited to look forward to coffee again and learning the craft that was more of a burden when I was young and behind a busy bar. I’ve always been an early adopter and coupled with the fact that i have limited space for a “whole damn setup” I decided to order the Meraki, which seems a workflow that I can handle and hopefully a machine that will last at least a few years till I decide how much deeper to go..

I’ve been getting impatient and had decided to cancel my order and go a more traditional route of proven grinder and proven machine but I emailed Meraki and they assured delivery within 3 weeks…. What the heck should I do?  I am willing to take the risk of the Meraki for the potential that it is a great machine but I can probably get a decent setup for $1800 and have it next week… I can’t stop thinking about pulling shots and it’s this communities fault..",3,1740378154.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

i'm thinking about why she ran away   
1) she was uncomfortable? (But everything was going just fine? and I didn't even specify it was a date)  
2) she's not into me (Ok not to be like. egoistic. but i was VERY nice and i'm not ugly!!)  
3) she's straight (this might be a problem...)  
4) she had no idea what was going on  
IF it's (2) or (3) i won't push i just wanna clear up any misunderstandings and go back to pining from a distance until i get over her!! but i haven't gotten any chance to see her since like friday!!
