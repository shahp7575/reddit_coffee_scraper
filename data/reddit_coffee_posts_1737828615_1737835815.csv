1i9voou,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9voou,"Advice please - my 11 year old spayed female Norwich Terrier has become anxious and growly, (and sometimes bitey with my husband) after losing her lifelong dog companion late this past summer","Sorry this is so long - I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve had my dog, Coco since moments after she was born. She was rejected by her mother, and I hand raised her. She‚Äôs always been very sassy and stubborn, always top dog in the house, but she was ALWAYS sweet and affectionate with every human she encountered. In late summer our 18 year old terrier mix, Toto was euthanized, at home. He had been ill and declining for a long time, and was ready. Since then, her behavior has changed completely. Coco was present, and after he had passed we all took some time to sit with him. Coco seemed agitated at first, but when we all got up from sitting with him, she went and laid down right up against him, snuggling against him in a way she never had when he was alive. Over the next few days I would wonder where she was, and discover her sitting on the deck in the spot where he passed, looking lost. It was heart breaking. She started declining herself, not sleeping, having intense separation anxiety, wanting to be held all the time, losing weight. After a couple of vet appointments we discovered she has liver disease. I have finally found a feeding schedule and food that seems to be tolerated, and she‚Äôs putting a bit of weight back on. She‚Äôs sleeping, she‚Äôs got some pep back in her step. Emotionally though, she‚Äôs a mess. I‚Äôve been taking her with me when I leave the house, because she just cries, and then listens for me over and over again if I don‚Äôt. She goes to the office with me, running errands, etc. I try to make it as fun as possible for her, stopping to walk in fields and check out nature trails and stuff, but she‚Äôs still waiting in the car for me if I go get groceries or have coffee with a friend and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs great for her. At the office she‚Äôs adored, but she has become a wild card to the point where I don‚Äôt let people get too close. She‚Äôll growl most of the time now. She‚Äôll actually get excited to see everyone, approach a coworker for pets, push into the petting, but be growling at the same time. 

My husband and stepdaughter are both heartbroken. They used to cuddle and snuggle with Coco, but now she‚Äôs growly with them, and snappy with my husband in particular. He jokes that she‚Äôs ‚Äúclosed her circle‚Äù to the point where it‚Äôs just me. 

My untrained, gut-driven guess is that she‚Äôs terribly insecure, and since she‚Äôs lost her companion, who was the bottom dog, she‚Äôs trying to make sure SHE‚ÄôS not the bottom dog. 

As far as the separation anxiety, In not sure. I‚Äôm the only constant in her life - I got divorced and my ex did not stay in touch. My daughter took the cat and moved out. I‚Äôm the only one who hasn‚Äôt disappeared. (Not sure if that‚Äôs even a dog thing.) Maybe she‚Äôs afraid I‚Äôll disappear too?

She‚Äôs got pretty significant age-related sight impairment as well. 

I could be way off base, and even if I‚Äôm not, I have no idea how to start making things better for her. If anyone has any suggestions I would be so grateful. I love this dog with all my heart, and this has been such a rough few months - losing Toto and then watching her suffer. 

Info: I give her Denamarin for her liver, and Purina Calming Care probiotic, which our vet recommended. She said it can take 1 - 2 months to see any benefit, and it‚Äôs only been about a week. Her food is Zignature canned kangaroo formula. I give her about a melon-ball sized portion every two hours while she‚Äôs awake, garnished with a dash of organic baby food (pur√©ed apple and sweet potato usually), the probiotic and a bit of psyllium fiber.

I am a 28-year-old male, and I have a sense of humor that is regularly a hit or miss.

Get in touch with me if you like any or all of the following topics: movies, small-talk, philosophical discussions, cinema, traveling, chess, language, literature, history, music,  philosophy, science, coffee, or just the daily weather patterns where we're based.

I fully understand delays between responses, life can get in the way. Sometimes life has to get in the way for us to fuel our creativity enough to jot down a reply. So, yeah. Take your time, and please drink a coffee when writing to me because I fully understand the creative pressure to write something down, given that I am currently full-steam ahead writing my master thesis.

An idea for our communication: what if we incorporate some creativity and themes into our penpaling? Imagine a literary challenge writing as if we were two penpals from a more old-fashioned era? Or we add some graphics or style to our (E?) letters based upon themes. Or just maintaining a collaborative journal of our artistic endeavors, be it photography or other hobbies. I plan to take and develop artsy film photos from an analogue camera, so I can send these over via snail mail. It converges as a handwritten letter, a penpal memento, and a slice of art that I share. Just brainstorming here, trying to explore new hobbies and build upon my old ones, so feel free to suggest any creative pursuits of your own.

The trajectory I would like to follow is talk right here in the DM‚Äôs for a while before eventually moving onto email or snail mail. I look forward to speaking with you, regardless of gender & location. Would need you to be 21+ just so that I don‚Äôt feel old not understanding your references, and would also need for you to be a real person. By that I both mean authenticity from within and also a member of the anatomically-modern human species and not an A.I., we genuinely might be the last people ever to communicate using just our organic brains so it‚Äôd be great to do just that while we can.

If all of this resonates with you, send me a message or write a comment below, and let's get this party started (I have no idea why I said that, I am a very boring person and I do not go to parties).

Peace.

1i9vkpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9vkpb/kiprunsfast/,#KipRunsFast,"*Here‚Äôs the truth: this gear is nothing without me. My legs, my mind, my talent‚Äîthat‚Äôs what makes the magic happen. Sorry to everyone who bought the same shoes thinking they‚Äôd run like me. They won‚Äôt. #KipAndOnlyKip #WahoosAreTheFuture #KipRunsFast.*

These are the types of posts Kip Hoffbloom posted ‚Äì along with a perfectly curated flat lay of his gear, with a trophy in the corner for motivation, and his lucky blue Brooks hat. One could imagine him posting, quickly exiting out, and waiting for his phone to chirp out notifications. Kip was trail running‚Äôs poster child‚Äîliving proof that not all grit and glory comes without a side of ego.

You know the ones ‚Äì those guys (and sometimes ladies ‚Äì let‚Äôs not be judgemental), who preach being an ultra trail runner isn‚Äôt just a lifestyle‚Äîit‚Äôs a higher calling. Sure, not everyone can handle it. And, let‚Äôs be real: it takes a special kind of person to spend hours alone on the trails, conquering terrain that would break most people in minutes. While others waste their weekends binge-watching TV, ultra runners are out there grinding through miles of wilderness, proving they‚Äôre tougher, faster, and more resilient than 99% of the population. This isn‚Äôt just about running‚Äîit‚Äôs about domination. It‚Äôs for people like Kip‚Äîpeople who refuse to settle for mediocrity and need the world to know it. And the best way to let the world know? Post it.

And, he did ‚Äì daily. Actually, multiple times a day. There were posts of his clothes, supplements, and medals. Smiling wide, Kip always standing tall in the middle, flanked by his supposed minions. Sprinkle in a few ambassador branded salutes, a couple support the efforts to bring a missing female runner home, and a lot of coffee cheers ‚Äì and you had his feed set to a science.

Kip was training for a 100-mile trail race ‚Äì the MadMan 100. And, though Kip was egotistical, rather sexist, politically small minded, and enlisted predatory tactics to coerce attention from females in the run club, people began to take notice. As soon as he posted about this next training cycle, The Wahoos, a local run club, jumped in to comment and like the posts. He got invited to podcasts, and soon his fanbase on Insta and Strava soared. Training for an ultra is grueling, but he was thriving. By February, his routine locked in. The winter landscape made for even better pictures. Running in shorts in sub-zero weather? That‚Äôs the kind of grit that gets you reshared.

One morning, after snapping a quick selfie, breath fogging the air, his beard already dripping with icicles, he set off on a secluded trail he had run hundreds of times. The trailhead sign was littered with flyers ‚Äì upcoming events, missing people notices, and an advertisement for hunting guide services. Kip obviously didn‚Äôt read these ‚Äì why would he? He knew what races were coming, and frankly, they made for a poor backdrop to any selfie.

This morning felt like any other‚Äîuntil he saw her. In the distance, through the trees, a woman moved, her gait impossibly fluid, like she was floating over the uneven terrain. Other runners frequently populated these woods, but something about her‚Äîthe way she seemed to vanish just as he thought he‚Äôd catch up. Her tracks were light and small, like a deer‚Äôs. Farther away, her pony tail bobbed like a rabbit‚Äôs tail, as it ducked for cover.

Over the next few weeks, he couldn‚Äôt stop looking for her. Every few days, Kip would catch a glimpse of this phantom female runner ‚Äì her pink hat bobbying through the brush. Each time, she would remain just out of reach. His heart raced, not from exertion, but from anticipation. Kip never saw her car in the lot, so she must‚Äôve used another access point. He began parking at different trailheads, running at odd times, burning through PTO just to find her. Ultra running can be an obsession, and for him, it (or she) had become all-consuming.

The lack of sleep and the miles were taking their toll. Kip‚Äôs times were slowing, his body aching from shin splints, blisters, and frostbite. Kip‚Äôs beard grew shaggy, streaked with gray, and his eyes‚Äîhe could see it in the rearview mirror‚Äîhad that wild look.¬†

MadMan 100 was less than a month away, and Kip was ready to begin tapering ‚Äì which meant less time on the trails ‚Äì unless he wanted to die trying.¬†

And then, in early March, Kip saw her again. This time, she was clearer, her form more defined based on the proximity to him. She stopped, waved, and then disappeared into the trees. His heart pounded as he slammed his truck into park, leaving the keys inside. He knew these trails like the back of his hand and sprinted to cut her off at the bridge.

The mist clung to the forest that morning, muffling Kip‚Äôs footsteps as he closed the distance. The closer he got, the more uneasy he felt. Light in a forest can be uncanny ‚Äì and, as he moved swiftly, Kip couldn‚Äôt help but notice there was a darkness creeping onto the trail, though no clouds or canopy obstructed the light from above. Trees and their limbs, barron and naked, moved uncharacteristically, appearing to shudder and jut at him as he approached. Large black birds perched, high above, watching his progress.

¬†At the cutoff, Kip finally closed in at the bridge. Just ahead, was his trophy ‚Äì the runner. He could see her whole figure now ‚Äì swiftly running, feet seeming to never quite touch the ground. Suddenly, her form seemed to shift unnaturally, bending and blurring like something out of a nightmare. Her pace wasn‚Äôt a run or a walk but a strange, erratic rhythm that both drew Kip in and filled him with dread. As her image seemed to flash in and out before him, like a television with a poor signal, her image was transferred to a tangled mess of bushes and brush.

When Kip finally stopping, reaching her, reality hit him like a blow. She wasn‚Äôt alive. She wasn‚Äôt even human anymore. What Kip saw was a decayed corpse, grotesquely entangled in the gnarled branches of an ancient oak. She was still in running gear, her bright clothing dulled by moss and dirt, even the bright, pink hate. She‚Äôd been there a long time, swallowed by the wilderness, forgotten. The only movement now was the gentle swishing of her hair, caught, yet free flowing in a cool breeze.

Kip stumbled back, his breath hitching in his throat. The woods were silent, save for the pounding of his heart and a low shuddering from the trees that groaned in the wind. Turning, he bolted toward his truck, mind racing. He couldn‚Äôt explain what he had seen‚Äîand wasn‚Äôt sure he wanted to. Had this woman ‚Äì this runner ‚Äì ever actually been here? Had he been running all this time for nothing? Who was he chasing?

These thoughts played through in his mind, as he tried to make sense of what just happened. Moving swiftly, Kip began to mediate the same words over and over ‚Äì Kip Runs Fast. Kip Runs Fast.

But now, the trails are darker, the paths overgrown. He had¬† been here before, yet he couldn‚Äôt find his way out. Trees he hadn‚Äôt noticed before lay across paths, and the well worn grooves in the spring mud appeared grassed over. The mile markers became distorted or the numbers no longer followed a logical sequence. The woods went on forever. More than once, he turned a corner and saw the woman, with sun bleached hair, still entangled in the branches of the tree. Opening his mouth to scream, his voice was lost ‚Äì or possibly overshadowed by the angry caw of the crows watching the scene unfold. All he could do was press on, as the night gathered around him.¬†

Those who followed Kip were alerted to a new post, which was accompanied by an image of a man, huddled up in a fetal position in a clearing of brambles. Hugging himself, hand holding his phone, which shined like a beacon from the matted grass:

*I‚Äôve been running forever. No end. She‚Äôs still here. I‚Äôm still here. #NoWayOut #Endless #LostInTheLoops. Maybe I never will. #LostForever #EndlessLoop #UltraRunnerHell #KipRunsFast #KipRunsForever #NoWayOut*",1,1737835274.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1i9vk1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyZapper/comments/1i9vk1k/a_keto_diet_grocery_list_for_beginners_31/,A Keto Diet Grocery List For Beginners - 31 Must-Have Items,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1737835232.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

I went to pick up some cat food, coffee and creamer at hyvee. Saw that my tarp on my car was off. So I fixed it went inside. My cat greeted me like always at the door. She then sniffs the hyvee bag and my duffel bag. Out of no where she started to hiss and peed everytime I tried to grab my stuff. She also started to swat at me. So I gave her space and time.

The next morning she was hissing at me. I went to work. Came back and she was hissing a little still. Gave her some treats and played with her. Seemed to calm her down. After that she went back to normal.

Today went to hyvee again. Fixed the tarp on my car again. Since it's really windy outside. After we came back. She started hissing at me again.

So I need some help or advice. Could it be something with hyvee or the tarp or something wrong with her? Cause she's never done this. Even when I would go on vacation for a week. She never acted like this.",1,1737835225.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False
1i9vjsr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9vjsr,Profitec Quick steam (Joysticks) replacement help. W,"Hey all, 

I have a Profitec Pro 500 PID, I bought it at the end of 2021 & had been solid for the last couple of years. 

Due to expected wear and tear my valves have become stiff and sometimes lock and leak on me. I know I could repair them. Though parts are out of stock atm.. So I thought it might be an option to look at upgrading them to the official Profitec Joystick valves. (Part No - P8119) 

Anyways, when I attempted this the replacement, it looks like my Steam Boiler pipe is a fixed length & a weird shape in order to fit the original vales. The Official joysticks have a longer thread, compared to the square valves so I couldn‚Äôt mount this flush to my machine.

So I did some digging and found on Clive coffee that the ECM Joystick part has an 6mm Allen thread inside to remove the longer thread. Do you know if I can remove the original thread of the square valves? Then mount it to the new joystick assembly? 

I have attached pictures of my issue: 

I saw someone had done this for another p600 but that‚Äôs a dual boiler and will have different internal pipe lengths.

1i9vj3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Advanced_Pair138/comments/1i9vj3d/maid_to_be_erotica/,Maid to Be (Erotica),"I heard the shackling of her restraints in the kitchen as my maid made me a cup of coffee. This is how our morning usually goes. She makes me a coffee followed by me watching the morning news and her kneeling at my feet awaiting for my next commands. This is our relationship, she‚Äôs my maid as well as my sub‚Ä¶ a pet if you will.

She lives with me 24/7. She sleeps in my bed‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ when I allow her to‚Ä¶ Her other lodging place is in the living room shackled to the fireplace. She knows to use the bathroom before she goes to bed because she knows the consequences if she does not. It‚Äôs always amusing to watch her patiently sit on the toilet checking, double checking, making sure she is good to lock herself away for the night. When she sleeps, she gets shackled and gets placed in chastity. I don‚Äôt want her masturbating without permission.

We met in the library. She was reading an erotic novel that caught my attention.

‚ÄúHave you ever thought about living out those fantasies?‚Äù I asked her.

‚ÄúI actually have not because nobody I know is into this kind of stuff. I‚Äôm actually kind of embarrassed that you know what this book is,‚Äù she responded with a chuckle.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be‚Ä¶ Would you want to know what it‚Äôs like?‚Äù I said to her. She was hesitant at first but intrigued at the idea of living out her fantasies. One thing led to another and 6 months later we were in a D/s dynamic.

She sits there waiting for a dose of attention, a drop of appreciation and recognition, yet she battles that urge with something else‚Ä¶ approval, more specifically, my approval. I watch her in her outfit that I picked for her. I cotton white tank top, no bra, and a black thong. The cotton white tank top does not do anything; it barely covers her tits and complements her thong perfectly. Her nipples can be seen easily through her clothing, they‚Äôre as stiff as can be. She loves to wait for me.

‚ÄúAnything else Sir?‚Äù She breaks the silence. Her eyes darted mine inquisitively.

‚ÄúTable‚Ä¶‚Äù I command.

She smiles and quickly rushes to all fours to become the table for my coffee. She feels the pleasure of being useful and wanted even if she is degraded.

‚ÄúShirt off‚Ä¶ ‚Äú I command.

‚ÄúBut Sir‚Ä¶ the coffee‚Ä¶ it's hot.‚Äù she said in a concerned yet excited tone.  
‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I responded followed by a smirk.

She says, ‚ÄúYes Sir.‚Äù

She was shaking from nervousness or excitement, I couldn‚Äôt tell but I knew she was hiding her smile. She took off her tank top and exposed her perky nipples plastered with her horniness. I sat up from the couch and watched, admiring her willingness to please.

Afterwards, she got back on all fours and prepared to be my table.

I took the cup of coffee and set it on her pale white skin. Just then I heard her yelp. Her eyes squinted and her teeth showed; the sounds of her voice and the sight of her muscles tense was amusing and sexy.

I petted and rubbed my hands through her hair which did not help considering the stress on her body. ‚ÄúGood girl‚Ä¶‚Äù I reassured her.

I got closer to her and asked her, ‚ÄúHow would you like to serve me today?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow ever‚Ä¶ mmm‚Ä¶ you want me to serve you Sir aahhh‚Äù She gasped as she felt my fingers reach down between her legs to rub her pussy. She knew I could feel her wetness. The dampness in her thong and the fact my fingers could slip right into her were her tattle tales.

I watched her shake trying desperately to balance out the pain with the pleasure. I enjoyed watching her struggle, I will admit. There is something about a woman who is desperate for pleasure that is so intoxicating.

Just when she became comfortable with the pleasure, I pulled away reminding her who is in control. She replied, clearing her throat and letting out a gasp.

I admired her once more, the beverage perfectly placed on her skin knowing she‚Äôd stay like that all day, not because of my approval but because of my disapproval. She knew if she spilled the coffee, she‚Äôd be punished. ‚ÄúCome with me to the room,‚Äù I commanded. ‚ÄúAnd place my coffee in the kitchen. Don‚Äôt spill it again!‚Äù

Her eyes dilated and an expression of disbelief covered her face. Nevertheless she said, ‚ÄúYes Sir,‚Äù knowing that it was a near impossible task‚Ä¶

I hear the glass fall and shatter. Immediately I walk back to the living room, to find the coffee cup shattered on the floor and my maid nowhere to be found.

I walk towards the scene and see through my peripheral vision her rushing into the room with a broom.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Sir! I really tried to not spill it but it just fell over! I will clean this up right now and then you deal with me however you want to.‚Äù

I do not respond to her and watch as she cleans up the glass with the broom. I smirk as I see her naked body embarrassed and disappointed in herself for spilling the drink.

Once she finishes sweeping, she then grabs the mop and proceeds to grab the bucket of water. She walks over to the mess and just as she is about to mop up the coffee, I interrupt.

‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre doing with that mop?‚Äù

‚ÄúCleaning Sir, did you want me to suck your cock first? I can do that for you for my stupid performance with the coffee.‚Äù She drops the mop and heads towards me. ‚ÄúI know you deserve the best Sir and I know that you do not deserve my shitty service or my unsatisfying throat, but I will always do my best to please you.‚Äù She starts to kneel‚Ä¶

I grab her by the throat gently and pull her up to her feet.

She lets out a whimper like a puppy, it‚Äôs cute but cuteness won‚Äôt do her any good.

‚ÄúSo you spill my coffee, don‚Äôt even clean it up, and then proceed to think that I wanted you to suck my cock and you did it without invitation‚Ä¶ ‚Äú

‚ÄúI thought you wanted me to please you Sir.‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúI wanted you to clean up and keep the house clean which you have yet to do. You cleaned up the glass which was great, but you didn‚Äôt finish. Do you have anything to say for yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶‚Äù

I squeeze a little tighter.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Sir,‚Äù she lets out faintly.

‚ÄúWhat am I going to do with you?‚Äù I say as I look her up and down. Just then something catches my eye. A drop of what looks to be like water right in between her legs and below her pussy. I chuckle as I take the band of her panties and pull it away to look inside. The smell of her immediately hits me along with the view of her soaked panties.

She blushes and looks down.

‚ÄúDo you want to cum maid?‚Äù I ask her.

‚ÄúYes Sir‚Ä¶ I want to cum so bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll you have to do is ask‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSir may I please rub my pussy and cum?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely not!‚Äù I command.

She bites her lips and crosses her legs.

‚ÄúNow go clean up the coffee and do so with your tongue.‚Äù I say as I let her go and push her away.

Her eyes widen and she obeys.

She gets on all fours and begins to lick up the coffee. Her ass up and her head down.

‚ÄúGood girl‚Ä¶ Now, when you‚Äôre done, meet me in the room.‚Äù I say as I smack her ass. I can tell that put a smile on her face as I made my way to the room.",1,1737835164.0,u_Advanced_Pair138,0,1.0,True

About six weeks ago, I saw it was stained pretty bad from all of the coffee that was being drank from it and the dishwasher wasn't helping anymore. I tried different cleaning tricks including magic erasers, baking soda and vinegar, and even these fizzy cleaning tablets I saw on Amazon. Nothing was  helping so I had an idea. I sent it in to be repaired under their lifetime warranty saying it wasn't sealing anymore, and they sent it back looking like brand new!

My uncle showed up to visit my demented grandmother in the nursing home and didn‚Äôt realize my nDad and nMom were there. He walked in to the room, nDad and nMom were seated. My uncle says hello. They ignore him completely, my uncle standing in the doorway. He broke up the silence again by stating that it is awkward to just stand in silence and they should clear the air. My nDad stands up, charges at my uncle balling up his fist and winding up. During this, he yells that my Uncle ‚Äútook [me]‚Äù from him and my uncle and I must be ‚Äúfooling around.‚Äù My nDad has insinuated several times that my uncle and I might be in a sexual relationship??? Bizarre. My Uncle backs up through the door putting his hands up and pushes at his chest level to make space and get out of the room.

My grandmother shuffles out of the room in her Clarks and tells üòÇ the Nursing Home director is on the way.

The director asks if anyone is hurt, needs medical attention, or would like to make a police report- they say no. Once nMom and nDad depart, they call the police and report an assault. 

This is beyond mortifying- for everyone involved. You got in a fight AT A NURSING HOME full of demented people at 8 in the morning. No one has even had time to drink their coffee. I am glad no one was hurt, but in many ways relieved that the staple of the community act has finally dropped. He has ALWAYS been violent. He has ALWAYS been this miserable/angry.

I did meet her once in those 3 years but thing got very ugly very soon and that was it. Now over the period of the time we had been apart she had tried reaching out to me multiple times but I felt like I had not moved on yet / or not made enough of a progress to see her and not fell for her so I kept her out, not talking, communicating or anything. 
Fast forward this year I met her three days ago at a concert where I first saw her sister, and in the heat of the moment and because of the adrenaline rush decided to hit her up, she quickly responded and when I saw her she had a guy with her , his hands wrapped around her waist. That broke me, something I had not expected tbh. I thought I had moved on completely and seeing her sister I just thought hey why not meet her too. Well the concert ended and when I was on my way back home she invited me to her place but I rejected cause I wasn't feeling it. Now that night we talked on text. I was very calm, as if nothing happened, which kept freaking her out as why I wasn't arguing or fighting and just acting like we didn't end on ugly terms in the past. She was confused why and how I randomly dropped into her life all of a sudden especially after ignoring her so much. But she asked to meet and I was like sure. 
So the next day comes and we met for coffee, she told me about her life and I listened. How she had missed me so much and so many things and occasions reminded her of me. How she had wanted me to be there with her during her accomplishments and how she needed me in so many times of need. I listened to how the guy she left me for cheated on her and left her way more miserable, how she is enjoying the attention from men being single after so long. 
One thing that did make me feel weird, and it should not have (that's what I think) she had built up so many Walls around her, and they seemed targeted towards me. Now I may be overthinking this, but it seemed like she was extra careful with me and what we talked about and everything, kind of afraid to get close again. I don't know. Well I told her how I felt , how I still feel. How I thought I had moved on and I probably would not be in favor of a relationship with her if the idea comes up yet she is the one I love and I always have.
It wasn't a proposal of any sort, more of a expression to make her aware of my side. 

Now the thing is after that meet, she has not talked to me. No messages no nothing. Things have gone completely silent. It was her birthday today, and I wished her to which I got a pretty bland thnx in return. Am I really just another human being for her? The once special thing that we had , is that no more? Or worse am I just a guy like all others for her? 
I'm really confused on what I should do? How she thinks? How I feel even? And it's getting to my head. 
I'm a guy with a pretty strong mind , and one that never really got attracted to many girls. Who would joke around and everything but never lead a girl on. Heck I even got proposed by a couple of girls I knew and I was the one who said no. But this girl I swear to God , she is just different. Never seen one like her, but the way she makes me feel, it's like I'm alive again. A sense of adrenaline and peace all together, at the same time. 
I'd love some advice from some older people out there. I feel lost right now, anything or any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thnx

The first half:  vibes of thrill and a beautiful family working together to survive. 

Then it all turns for the worse.  The mom delves into the water to save her drowning kid.  And from this point onwards, little to nothing made sense.  Suddenly Jana(?) turned out not to be in the water.  Then the mom drowned?  Although it was never clear, because they dragged her into the cabin(?).  

Yep ‚Äî dead I guess?  She never appeared again, so.  But the brother (Adam) tells Jana nothing.  The dad asks for a cup of coffee.  Then a bit later he crawls out to the shore and appears to have some sort of strange seizure.  The son (Adam) puts on his headphones.  Is the dad dead now too?

""We'll see mom and dad soon,"" the son tells his sister.  Ehm . . . okay, is that a look back to when they were alone in the boat, before it capsized (mentioned in the beginning)?  Nope, they seem to be on the island still, so it's the present.  

And then too much psychological randomness to handle.  Pictures flashing by, views into different places without context.  All kids in a school being bombed (seemingly on the island too?).  And Yara, which I thought was Jana's late sister, wearing that shoe.  

Suddenly the island is covered with water, rising and rising, and from the lighthouse a blow-up boat suddenly unfolds ‚Äî which had previously been underneath the sand on the shore. 

That's right after they managed to communicate their location on the radio and saw help pass by, upon which Adam thought he could swin out to the boat with a short rope for safety.

I had boarded Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles, settling into my window seat near the middle of the plane. The flight seemed routine as the engines roared to life, and the plane began its ascent. I was flipping through a magazine, sipping coffee, when the first sign of trouble came‚Äîabrupt turbulence, more forceful than usual.

I dismissed it at first. Planes hit turbulence all the time. But then came a sharp turn‚Äîa violent veering to the left‚Äîthat sent my coffee spilling onto my lap. The atmosphere in the cabin shifted from calm to tense. Whispers turned to murmurs, and murmurs to nervous questions.

Suddenly, a commotion erupted at the front of the plane. People gasped, and a woman screamed. I craned my neck to see what was happening, but I was too far back. A flight attendant stumbled into the aisle, her face pale. She tried to remain composed, but the terror in her voice betrayed her as she whispered something to the passenger beside her.

Then came the announcement.

A man‚Äôs voice, unfamiliar and cold, crackled over the intercom. ‚ÄúWe have some planes. Stay quiet, and you‚Äôll be okay.‚Äù The chilling calmness in his voice made my stomach twist. This wasn‚Äôt turbulence. This was something far worse.

The hijackers had taken control of the plane. From my seat, I couldn‚Äôt see much, but I could hear the muffled cries of passengers and the sharp commands of the hijackers. My heart raced as the plane accelerated. It felt like we were descending too fast. People around me were praying, crying, holding hands.

Passengers frantically pulled out their phones, attempting to call loved ones. But there was no coverage. The signals failed to connect, leaving people staring at their screens in disbelief or clenching their phones tightly in frustration. The helplessness was written on their faces. Some pressed their hands to their heads, others whispered prayers, and a few simply sat silently, tears streaming down their cheeks. I wanted to call my family too, but I knew it was hopeless. My hands trembled as I gripped the armrest, waiting for what would come next.

The impact.

I‚Äôll never forget the sound. A deafening roar as the plane collided with something‚Äîa tower, though I didn‚Äôt know it at the time. The force was unimaginable, like being hit by a train and tossed into a cyclone. Fire, smoke, and shards of metal tore through the cabin. The screams of passengers were swallowed by the explosion.

I don‚Äôt know how I survived. Maybe it was sheer luck, or maybe it was a miracle. The plane disintegrated around me as the tower absorbed the impact. One moment I was bracing for death, and the next, I was falling‚Äîweightless, suspended in time. Then darkness.

I woke up amidst chaos.

When I opened my eyes, I was on a lower floor of the North Tower. The plane‚Äôs nose had pierced through the building, and I had been thrown clear of the wreckage. My body ached, my ears rang, and the air was thick with smoke and the stench of jet fuel. Around me, people were screaming and scrambling to escape the inferno. I looked down at my hands, covered in cuts and soot, and realized I was alive.

Disoriented and in shock, I staggered to my feet. Flames roared above me, and the heat was unbearable. I stumbled toward a stairwell, joining the flood of terrified people trying to make their way down. Some were injured, some were crying, and others moved with a silent determination to survive.

The descent.

The stairwell was a nightmare‚Äîdark, suffocating, and packed with people. The walls trembled with every aftershock. I heard fragments of conversations: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a plane... a hijacking... the South Tower‚Äôs hit too‚Ä¶‚Äù My mind couldn‚Äôt process it. I just focused on putting one foot in front of the other, descending floor after floor.

It felt like an eternity before I emerged into the chaos outside. The streets were a scene of devastation‚Äîash-covered survivors, emergency vehicles, and debris raining down from the towers above. I turned to look at the building I had just escaped, and that‚Äôs when I saw it‚Äîan enormous gash, flames pouring out, smoke billowing into the sky. It didn‚Äôt seem real.

I didn‚Äôt have time to process what had happened. A firefighter grabbed me and pulled me away from the building, shouting, ‚ÄúRun! It‚Äôs coming down!‚Äù I ran with every ounce of strength I had left, not looking back until I heard the deafening roar of the tower collapsing.

Even years later, the memories are vivid.

Surviving that day felt like both a blessing and a curse. I lived when so many didn‚Äôt. The guilt is something I carry with me, but so is the gratitude. Every day since has been a reminder of how precious life is, and how quickly it can change forever.",1,1737834614.0,ChatGPT,1,0.67,False

1i9v9qe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9v9qe,AIO my friend thinks that a writer's retreat is going to their local cafe,"I (M23) threw out the idea of a writing trip/retreat to my friend (M22)a few months ago and we were both keen because we've had lots of film ideas without the right environment to focus on them. Couple days after the initial thought, I travel to Southampton and think somewhere on the outskirts would be a good place to plan for. We both went to Southampton for university and have friends there. It's not too far away from either one of us (hour for him from London, 2.5 hours for me).

That is where the screenshots start. He immediately dismisses my idea even though he really enjoyed his time at Southampton and claims that a random recent time when he was stuck in Andover suburbs is somehow relevant. I explain that suburbs is not what I had in mind but then he says that he needs civilisation, which I don't think is what most people want out of a writers trip. I explain what I mean and we sort of leave it up in the air.

A few weeks after that, he messages about the retreat and outright says that I should just go to a cafe in London. This would be very convenient for him and less so for me and less fulfilling which I explain in the screenshots. 

For context, he lives a very ""bohemian"" lifestyle, working two casual jobs, crashing on a sofa for months. He lived in Hong Kong until going to uni. I live in a fairly big town/small city without too many friendship circles here so I rely on going to London, Southampton, or Brighton to meet old friends. I work full time and am also a foreigner in the UK but have lived here a lot longer (language difference? Though he has a very good understanding of English having done an Humanities degree at a high ranking university).

Am I overreacting by disregarding the plans entirely? He's not someone to call me out on this but I just don't know if I'm ditching the plans without properly explaining myself. Should I just go by myself/with others? Should I just accept his plan for going to a London cafe?",1,1737834457.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

I saw Dr. Kaplan in NYC, he has been amazing and super knowledgeable, he‚Äôs even made a post here and says he comes here regularly to keep tabs on how things are going in our special little community! 

Surgery went really smooth. Kaplan only does under anesthesia and did 100 units. The worst part immediately after surgery was a sore throat but that went away within a few days. I had to sleep on an incline for weeks because of regurgitation, don‚Äôt bend over! I suffered with acid reflux before and it was indeed WAY worse after. Slow swallow was easy to get used to and I still have it to a small degree. Two or so days after surgery I was having microburps, a week post op I had a soda and let out the biggest burp of my life. At first coffee really made everything worse, but I could tolerate better with time. The first month was really uncomfortable, burps came whenever they wanted, it was just really uncomfortable and embarrassing. Each day everything kept getting better. I had to learn the pressure in my throat didn‚Äôt mean I was going to puke, which was a mental block to burping at first. I still drink at least one soda a day to keep practicing. Burps are now so much more controlled. Everyone said turning your head helps get burps out but that did nothing for me, for me, sticking my neck out forward and chin out (like major underbite) has helped get burps out. In the beginning I‚Äôd have a LOT of saliva when burps came out and almost felt like I was choking, but again, every day it got better. Overall my symptoms are so hugely improved, I‚Äôm not bloated, flatulence is normal and overall I‚Äôm REALLLLLLY happy I did it. Feel free to ask any questions! Hopefully I didn‚Äôt leave out any big details, but if I did, I‚Äôll edit and add them. ",3,1737834404.0,noburp,1,0.8,False

1i9v8tk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1i9v8tk/antecedence/,Antecedence,"Suzie died on a Sunday. It was an accident, a stray bullet near the park, a kid bent on revenge unloading a pistol from a car window. She‚Äôd been up past midnight coding and she wanted to get some air. She fell, bleeding out silently, exhaling her last gasps to the brisk air and the hazy black sky. They didn‚Äôt find her body until a passerby went walking toward the police cordon and screamed.

On Saturday, Leysan asked if Suzie could finish up the Monday deliverable for her. She had a portrait commission due, and she swore to take the helm on the next project. *You‚Äôre the actual best*, she wrote. *I‚Äôll take you out for drinks soon. Love you brilliant girl <3*

On Friday, Audrey went shopping for a gift for her mother‚Äôs birthday. The first store was irrationally pricey, and in the second, the antique-looking lamp she‚Äôd seen a few weeks ago was gone. The third store gave her an idea, though. There was a painting by the register, a pair of Germanic-looking children posing tweely on a swing. Audrey and her brother painted in an 18th-century style. She‚Äôd commission her college friend Leysan to do the painting. Leysan was always saying she wished she could make it as an artist, instead of selling her design skills to some puffed-up tech startup that greedily siphoned up her evenings and weekends.

On Thursday, Noah went to a kitschy gallery shop to buy his roommate a new painted lamp. He got lucky‚Äîit was the last one they had in stock.

On Wednesday, Noah noticed that his apartment was ever-so-slightly trashed. The kitchenette was in disarray, assorted dents pocked the wall, and his roommate‚Äôs decorative lamp had a ragged tear running through it. It was his fault from the other night‚Äîhe‚Äôd invited a couple people over to cheer Max up, and things snowballed from there. He surreptitiously texted his roommate‚Äôs friend asking where she‚Äôd gotten the lamp.

On Tuesday, Max‚Äôs girlfriend found flirtatious texts on Max‚Äôs phone. It was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. She boxed up her things and moved in with her sister. With her gone, the apartment seemed far too empty, Max knocking around like a stray marble. He went to Noah‚Äôs place with two bottles of Coors Light.

On Monday, Max‚Äôs crappy old Ford broke down. He had to take a train and a bus to work, and the shitty schedule meant he got there half an hour before his shift. He ducked into a coffee shop to warm up and kill some time. There was this girl there, long brown hair and a silky scarf, her whole face lighting up when he said hello. He knew he shouldn‚Äôt be doing it, but it felt pure, simple. Like being a kid with a crush again.

On Sunday, Annette arrived after having traveled back in time to prevent Suzie‚Äôs death against Max‚Äôs unwary car. The time machine was set to take somebody back exactly a week.",6,1737834388.0,shortscarystories,1,1.0,False

A lot of things simply don‚Äôt bother me anymore. I wasn‚Äôt always like this though. I used to be an overly sensitive child, someone who was deeply affected by everything around them. I was that girl who would cry during the Republic Day flag hoisting or when Vande Mataram played. I couldn‚Äôt bear to see anyone in pain. I cared.

I guess that was a phase - a rebel phase - when you want to change all the wrongs around you. You have fire, passion, and a deep sense of purpose. But now, I‚Äôve become a very ""chill"" person. That‚Äôs not to say I‚Äôd ever do something wrong or hurt someone intentionally. But my reason for not doing so isn‚Äôt because of some moral compass - it‚Äôs simply because it takes too much effort. It costs me my mental peace, time, and energy. I‚Äôve stopped letting things affect me because I know the world isn‚Äôt going to change just because I care. So now, I stay in my lane. Again, I like helping people and do it whenever I can. But even that doesn‚Äôt affect me much. I don‚Äôt do it to stroke my ego or to fulfill some sense of karma. If someone needs my help and I‚Äôm in a position to assist, I simply do it. That‚Äôs it. I help and move on without dwelling on it.

I only care about myself, my four closest people to some extent, and animals. If someone intentionally tries to hurt me, it doesn't bother me. Sure, I feel disappointed if that hurt comes from someone close, and I cut them off, but it doesn‚Äôt affect me deeply. This attitude has its downsides too. I‚Äôm about to turn 25 and am currently unemployed, but I couldn‚Äôt care less about what my relatives say about me or how much it might hurt my parents.

Of course, I‚Äôm grateful, and I do want to clear my exam and get a job, but only for all the practical reasons. I absolutely refuse to let anyone emotionally manipulate me into doing something I don‚Äôt want to do. When it comes to relationships, I‚Äôve been naive and overly emotional - a hopeless romantic - and I‚Äôve been hurt a few times. But that was it when I was young and dumb in love. That doesn‚Äôt happen anymore. If someone is in my life, I‚Äôm happy. If no one‚Äôs there, I‚Äôm still happy.

I‚Äôve always had a love for poetry and shayari, and I still read it, but I guess I just don‚Äôt feel it as intensely anymore. What people think or say about me just doesn‚Äôt matter. I still love some of my dreams, and I‚Äôm constantly working towards them. At this point in life, the only thing I feel is missing is money. Other than that, I think I‚Äôm pretty chilled out.

That said, I absolutely adore my hobbies. I love hitting the gym or going for an early morning run. I enjoy music and a refreshing movie - though they don‚Äôt seem to make those anymore. Still, I have no problem watching silly, brainless movies either. I love sunrises and mountains, and I absolutely love winters.
I take pride in how my room is always neatly organized, with everything perfectly placed where it belongs. I find joy in small things, like my laundry drying on time. And coffee - oh, I absolutely love coffee.

A lot of readers on Wattpad have compared the tone to Tom Clancy or James Patterson, but I want to know if this prologue genuinely grabs attention‚Äîor if they‚Äôre just being nice!

The idea behind the prologue was to set the tone and raise questions about Reed‚Äôs dual life. It‚Äôs short, sharp, and sets the stage for the espionage theme while hinting at the unique way photography plays a role in the story.

Here‚Äôs the prologue:

Sneaking a prohibited item through airport security isn‚Äôt as hard as you‚Äôd think.
It's not about gadgets or technological tricks. It's about defeating people‚Äîtheir instincts, their assumptions, their reliance on patterns. Security thrives on predictability. Break that rhythm, shift the focus, and you create your own loophole.
Confidence is the key. No hesitation, no second glances. They don‚Äôt screen for contraband; they screen for fear. A confident man with a camera in his hand isn‚Äôt a threat‚Äîhe‚Äôs a professional, a reporter, an artist. The world opens its doors to people like him. Smile at the agent, crack a casual joke. Let them see what they expect: another traveler trying to make it to their gate before the boarding call.
But distraction‚Äîthat‚Äôs where the magic happens.
The glitzy advertisement cards lay scattered at the entrance of security: ‚ÄúFREE COFFEE AT GATE C13.‚Äù Simple, alluring. Who wouldn‚Äôt grab one? The promise of caffeine during a bleary-eyed morning rush. But no one considers the layers within that cardstock. No one thinks twice about the faint trace of lead embedded between its fibers‚Äîa subtle trick of the trade. When scanned, those cards cast the shadow of something ominous.
Now, thirty passengers clutch identical cards. Some are tucked into carry-on bags, others slipped into purses, all funneled through the checkpoint at the same moment. The machine beeps incessantly, confusion spreads, and security scrambles to pinpoint the cause. It‚Äôs perfectly timed chaos‚Äîand perfectly harmless. At least for them.
And while they‚Äôre untangling the mess, the real sleight of hand happens. A dismantled weapon hidden within the layers of a camera bag. Tripods, lenses, filters, cables‚Äînothing unusual for a photographer. Not worth a second glance. Cameras are the ultimate cover. Expected. Familiar. Invisible.
That‚Äôs the trick: disappear in plain sight. Don‚Äôt hide the act‚Äîhide the intention.
It‚Äôs not about the tools; it‚Äôs about the illusion. And when executed perfectly, an illusion becomes indistinguishable from reality.

I'll write my biggest deal breaker first so you don't have to keep reading if you're not interested.

Having lots of relationship history with intimacy. Personally I don't have ANY intimacy experience on purpose and I don't want someone with LOTS of experience/relationship history. Also if you broke up recently that's also a big no for me. No one is an aid band duh.

I'm 6.1 - 185cm muscular build, (not too shredded) wide shoulders, white skin, black hair, eyes and beard ( I don't like having a long beard so I keep it short or shave ) . You can see me from the link below.

I'm from Turkey and my ethnicity is Caucasian.

My personality type is INFP-A , I don't believe horoscopes or to any religion.

I'm a Concept/2D Artist. I draw character designs, potraits, any stuff I like.

I'm loyal, empathetic, protective, dependable and love to share every thought I have with my partner and also expect the same thing.

I love melancholy in general, I have couple of sad song playlists on Spotify.

My main hobbies are drawing, powerlifting and gaming. I also do some other stuff like playing electric guitar sometimes but who cares.

I like getting and giving attention in equal terms.

I'm also an open book, I don't hide anything.

Also, I do care about physical attraction, I'm adding my photos first so you don't have to send a message if you don't find me attractive enough. In the end everyone has a different taste.

So i broke up with this girl about 3 years ago because i moved in another country and that distance relationship wasn‚Äôt working for us both, not to say that the trust issues were getting worse. We started arguing about almost everything and we didn‚Äôt had a normal conversation for months and before that we broke up like two times because of some stupid reasons. Almost immediately after i broke up with her a few days later she started talking to some other guy that she meet. Then a year later she messaged me and honestly i was surprised because i didn‚Äôt expected anything from her at that point because i was like a year without contact and then out of nowhere she said: Hello Thomas. I didn‚Äôt know what to do and i texted her back and we started a conversation about the past and shit like that and after that i asked her if she was seeing someone else and she lied to me that she was single and didn‚Äôt had anybody else in her life. After a few days of texting all of the sudden she basically hided her story from me on instagram so that i couldn‚Äôt see what she was posting. The curiosity got the better off me and i created some new account and i saw her seating at a table with a guy drinking coffee. After that i stopped messaging her and that was all until she started wishing me happy birthday every single year. After we broke up i started lifting like hell and in three years i build a crazy Body and had a lots of girls after her so basically i did nothing more but to improve myself. She saw that and she started texting me again but i don‚Äôt want to talk to her.

Long story short my parents are divorced and we were  living in the same home untill he ( my dad ) got kicked out by mum So during this entire year I was mostly cleaning cooking and doing laundry while applying for school helping out my mom cause she works outside of home and he ( my dad ) works from home . During this I could slowly feel myself getting burnt out. So I decided to take breaks and every time I did my dad would shout at me for not cooking dinner and act helpless as if he can‚Äôt cook himself some dinner ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è he said that I should let him know a day before that I won‚Äôt be cooking and I said no , I don‚Äôt decide a day before that I am tired , I don‚Äôt know that tomorrow I will be tired hence you must just understand because I do almost everything in this home , I literally maintain the house ( p.s my mom would help by taking the weekends for cleaning and cooking ) and all he does is sit and work and order grocery and buys electricity  , like the house is owned by my mom , she was paying mine and my little brothers school fees , paying off the home as well as petrol for her car , water bills etc. He would get angry when I would tell him I‚Äôm not cooking today , he got angry when I didn‚Äôt want to rewrite a certain subject of his choice and bc of this he said he‚Äôll kick me out the house. During this same year I decided to bake something I saw on TikTok and it came out really sweet ( I literally followed the recipe step by step ) He shouted at me saying ‚Äú no wonder why you failed math, it‚Äôs little things like this that you can‚Äôt even do , your cookies a flippen sweet, can‚Äôt you fricken read a recipe and tell that the sugar might be too much ?!‚Äù When he gets angry he says hurtful things , I forgot to close the windows once on a rainy day  and he said that he‚Äôll slap me so hard that  I‚Äôll never forget anything.  He also makes me think for him like bc his in charge of grocery he asks me to make a list and order food and every time I do so he always tells me not to take long and I let him know that it‚Äôs different I might take long bc I have to use the search bar in the app to find certain foods, he ticked off on me again shouting about how slow I am and even insults my intelligence, he asks me ‚Äú what‚Äôs wrong with your mind ‚Äú ‚Äú how do you think ‚Äú ‚Äú do you even think ‚Äú I stopped helping him with grocery. He‚Äôd also get upset that certain things didn‚Äôt come in like ????? Bruh that app limits us to 30 items , wtf you raging about and he always blames it on me ‚Äú you forgot to buy tomato sauce , you didn‚Äôt order spice ‚Äú etc I felt so suffocated when he was living with us. He hardly had anything good to say. He once even said he pity‚Äôs me and feels sorry for me bc of the direction I was going religiously , ( all I did was go to a youth evening service at church ) what really blew it for me was one Sunday where I was so not having it , I discussed with my mom a day before to please handle Sunday lunch. He got into an argument with her and told me that his not gonna eat of my mom is cooking so I must cook. I didn‚Äôt reply. He repeated himself. I still didn‚Äôt reply. I went upstairs and took a nap. When I woke up my mom was done cooking , she went to the shops with my lil bro and it was just me and my dad at home. I came down to eat. While I was eating he said ‚Äú give me your phone , how dare you sit on the phone I bought you and not cook ! Now I have to cook my own fricking meal bc of you , this wouldn‚Äôt have happened if you just cooked , you‚Äôre just like your mom and you picking up bad habits like your mom , you just unlearn the things she teaches you ‚Äú he during this he was also indirectly calling my mom filthy and a pig and all kinds of rude and mean things. He also said that I mustn‚Äôt talk to him. The next day I wake up he speaks to me I say ‚Äú you said I shouldn‚Äôt talk to you ‚Äú he said ‚Äú
That‚Äôs not what I meant, but take it how you want ‚Äú so from there I didn‚Äôt speak to him and whenever he spoke to me I was intentional with my disinterest. A week later or so he got kicked out by mom through police and when I looked upstairs he took my phone with. So no phone for me. Fast forward , my mom bought me a phone. The house is peaceful. There‚Äôs no one dampening the mood and swearing at us. Now here‚Äôs the real deal. I got a new phone and changed my number and made sure not to have my dad‚Äôs number. Since his been kicked out everything is on my mom including grocery and electricity. He doesn‚Äôt help out for his kids sake. He only supports my little brother and my little brother visits him now and then and heads up my dad is a very successful man like him and my brother be chilling in beach houses and all. He doesn‚Äôt contribute to household things I think bc his being spiteful towards my mom Out of the blue on a phone call with my brother I overhead him say ‚Äú tell your sister that she must call me ! When is she gonna call me ?! I‚Äôve been waiting for her call ! Is she working ? What is she gonna do this year ! I need to know her plans for this year ! She must call me !‚Äù Uhm ? I feel like he owes me an apology for the verbal abuse and the way he treated me as if I was some maid of the house. Like I‚Äôd clean after him yall. Even his bathroom and his coffee spills. And he‚Äôd guilt trip me into cleaning his room , cause we have two bathrooms and to get to the other one is in his room so when I shower there or do whatever I do he says ‚Äú please clean my room since you use it ‚Äú but the things I be cleaning aren‚Äôt even my mess‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve noticed that it‚Äôs not out of respect that I do this but out of fear that his gonna rage or make me live uncomfortable. P.s with the financial pressure on my mom she puts pressure on me as well by saying things like ‚Äútext your dad , I know he‚Äôll provide for you , you know this too, just text him , he can give you money, why don‚Äôt you talk to your dad , I think you should message your dad , speak to your dad , his your dad cmon ‚Äú

I can‚Äôt figure whether I‚Äôm holding grudge or if I‚Äôm just rejecting his toxic energy

Scared out of his mind Shakes jumped out of bed, his heart pounding he cluched his hand around his chest, fingers going white from how tight he was squeezing the insides of his palm.

*A dream?*

He thought to himself, getting out of bed he rushed to the bathroom to take a look at himself to see and perhaps try and trick his mind into believing everything was fine.

*That's right, a dream.*

Getting out of the bathroom, he shut the alarm clock that had been ringing for a while in the background without him realizing.

Not much changes for a while, coffee, Spenza, driving to the Stadium, and...

Beeping of a glass door.

It all felt... eerily familiar. Like he had experienced these before.

Cheerings.

He had this restless feeling that something big was going to happen.

Screams.

He had been lying atop his bed for who knows how long by now, staring at the ceiling as if expecting it to change and show him a different future ahead. Barely finding the strength in himself he steadily moved his hand towards the alarm, turning it off with a simple tap on the head he reached for his phone that stood next to the alarm.

07:54

*6 minutes*

*Spenza should be here in around 6 minutes.*

And he was right, melodic tunes coming from the door, door creaking, and the same laughter. Spenza stood across him waiting to be let inside with a lively smile on his face, almost shining compared to the current impression of Shakes.",1,1737833838.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

I'm not shy but it's such a complicated situation. Before I go into the signs that tipped me off, I want to give context. 

We met 1 yr ago when she saw me studying by myself. She invited to sit next to her and also to get coffee. It felt friendly so I didn't assume anything. Overtime, I started to like her because she is pretty and nice. But she always dating someone which made me feel like I need to move on. That's kinda why I never made it clear to her I like her

Here's the signs: 
1. Playful teasing- she is like that with every guy that she talks to. However, I be catching strays from her. I could be minding my business and she is just going to call me out randomly in group settings. 

2. She gives light touches. Like if I say something funny or cool, she will hit my shoulder. So we have broke the touch barrier. I hit her back. 

3. She has complimented before. She doesn't do this anymore unfortunately. But she used to compliment by outfit or humor. She told me that I look good in scrubs. 

4. I take her home from bars. She always let me take her home. And we sing songs in the car together. Everytime she I take her home. She says her neighbors are trying to kill her. Idk if this her way of saying please walk me to my door. 

5. Drunk flirting- we she gets drunk. She flirts hard with me. Now she does this with 2 other guys. But she dated those guys before. She will hug me, share her drink and even put her hand around me. Last time I got drunk in a club, she grab my hand and made me twirl a few times. 

6. Eye contact- she will look at me in group convos and in class. I catch her starring sometimes. One time she past me in the hall and we held eye contact the entire time. 

7. Last one but she remembers detail that I tell her. Sometimes she will ask me about it but she doesn't forget anything. 


Here's the issue though, she is hot and cold. Some days she will act like this. Other days she won't. She has ignored me before and over talked a few times. She also never text me and has even ghosted in the past. I left her alone when she did this and she would eventually come back. To be fair, she was dating a guy at the time and she apologized for lying about her whereabouts. So thats why I have been histant. Her behavior can be inconsistent 

Should I just get direct and tell her how I feel or move on? We only have 4 weeks left so I could just do a screw it stragety ",2,1737833813.0,bodylanguage,1,1.0,False

Grab the gloves, leave the textbooks. Get your team together: it's time to register for the most anticipated law school event of the year, the **42nd Annual UVA Law Softball Invitational!**

**TL;DR: Sign up here (before you forget)!** [**Register Now**](https://www.ngsl.com/register-1)

**Here‚Äôs the Deal:**

* **When?** April 4-6, 2025
* **Where?** Charlottesville, Virginia (Home to Thomas Jefferson, great wine(ries), and LOTS of softball.)¬†¬†
* **Why?** Because law school isn‚Äôt just about reading case law and crying into your coffee. You need this. Trust us.

**What‚Äôs in It for You?**

* **Softball:** Who doesn‚Äôt love pretending they‚Äôre an elite athlete for a weekend?
* **Festivities:** This isn‚Äôt just a tournament, it‚Äôs a **weekend-long ""networking"" jamboree**. We know many of you have left your rambunctious days in the rearview. But for one weekend only, in the rolling hills of the Blue Ridge, we‚Äôre asking you to put down the Bluebook‚Äîlike seriously, we‚Äôre looking at you, Harvard‚Äîand dust off your party hats. Drink deals, bar tabs, and plenty of chances to embarrass yourselves in front of your soon-to-be summer class.¬†
* **Most Importantly, Charity:** Don‚Äôt worry, your hangover is for a good cause. Proceeds benefit ReadyKids, helping children and families in our community. Your stupidity on the field (and at the afterparty) helps raise over $40,000 for kids. No, seriously, it does. You can be a hero even if you're terrible at catching.

**A Few Logistics:**

* **Cost:** Registration is $950 per team. If you ask Student Affairs nicely, your school might pay. (And c‚Äômon, it's cheaper than therapy!)
* **Deadline:** Register by March 1st or face the wrath of the ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù emails from your team.
* **Team Size:** Each law school can bring up to 5 teams, including alumni teams. If you bring 1-4 teams, each team is capped at 25 players. If you manage to get enough people out of the library for 5 teams (we see you, Georgetown), you can bring as many players as you want.
* **Who can I bring?** Yes, there is structure amidst the chaos. You can choose between two leagues:¬†
   * **Co-Rec League:** Minimum 9 players, at least 3 nonmales on the field. If your team has 4 nonmales on the field, you can play 10 people.
   * **Open League:** No gender rules.

**Okay, this sounds great and all, but I suck at softball.** Don't worry, we‚Äôve got you covered. **New this year,** in addition to crowning the softball champs, we‚Äôll be handing out **superlative awards** throughout the weekend. Who will be the most fun at the bars? Who will show the most school spirit? Come find out, prove it's your team, and take home some serious bragging rights (and maybe a trophy or two). Like the B+ curve, we'll reward you just for showing up.¬†

**SO, stop pretending you‚Äôre too busy to have fun**. **Start** **booking flights to Charlottesville... We hold the #1 Quality of Life ranking for a reason.** If you can't beat your section nemesis in Contracts, at least you can hit more home runs.¬†

**Got Questions?** Just email us at [uvalawinvitational@gmail.com](mailto:uvalawinvitational@gmail.com) and we‚Äôll get back to you when we‚Äôre not too busy preparing for the best weekend of your law school career. **Let‚Äôs do this.** Can‚Äôt wait to see you in April.

**Morning**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia, Burley Farm**

Sheriff Reynard Mueller heaved a sigh, his gaze sweeping over the pearl-grain fields stretching out before him. The multitudes of stalks, heavy with ripe grain, appeared to shimmer in the sunlight as they swayed in the breeze. An idyllic pastoral scene common to Caedwyn Realm, the sort of sight that soothed Reynard's nerves in trying times, whether it was back in his days as a conscript in the Nexian legions, or dealing with the trials and tribulations of life on the frontier.

Reynard turned his gaze slightly to the right, the simple movement immediately souring his mood. Another plot of pearl-grain came into sight, but it was a far cry from the pristine view Reynard was admiring moments ago. A series of large and intricate patterns had been trampled into the field, as if it had been stamped by a giant branding iron from the heavens. The patterns were not confined to a single plot, but instead extended to several neighboring plots as well.

Worse still, the culprit behind the defaced fields had not been content to limit their mischief to the Burley farm. Similar patterns had been spotted out on the plains, grazing grounds, and even in the deep forest. As ever, the rumormongers were having a grand time speculating on the nature and intent of these mysterious markings. These myriad theories ranged from bored pranksters to foreign saboteurs. Even sinister beings from old folk tales were pointed to as the culprits.¬†

To add more kindling to the blaze, there had also been sightings of what folk were calling 'hexfire', strange and distant lights that danced in the sky with a speed and agility that did not match any creature or conveyance known to Caedwyn. Even worldly men like Reynard, who had served in the Nexian military in distant Realms, were at a loss to explain the bizarre occurrences. In the middle of this confusion, Reynard and the constabulary labored to carry out their duties. Looking to the mercifully clear skies, the Sheriff wondered if this was only the beginning of his troubles.

As if summoned by his dark mood, the angry thudding of hooves reached Reynard‚Äôs ears. That would be Eamon Burley, owner of this farm, no doubt ready to give him an earful about what an outrage this all was. Eamon was a gentleman who took it upon himself to voice his opinions at full volume, lest the world be deprived of his valuable insights. ‚ÄúAh well, nice while it lasted,‚Äù muttered Reynard, bidding silent farewell to the lovely view, and turning to face Eamon.  
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt take half of forever to get here, did you, Mueller?‚Äù bellowed the irate farmer.  
‚ÄúGood day to you too, Eamon,‚Äù greeted Reynard drily. ‚ÄúSteady on now, no sense in calling down the legions just yet.‚Äù  
‚ÄúHah! As if soldiers would be worth a damn for this mischief! There‚Äôs strange magic afoot!‚Äù said Eamon, gesturing to the defaced plot of pearl grain behind him.  
‚ÄúStrange magic? How do you reckon that, Eamon?‚Äù  
Eamon leaned in and whispered conspiratorially to Reynard. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dark business, I‚Äôm telling you. I‚Äôm no mage, but I did get a bit of the Sight from my blessed mother, and I didn‚Äôt feel one bloody bit of mana stirring during the whole commotion! How‚Äôs that possible, I ask you?‚Äù  
‚ÄúThat is a bit odd,‚Äù admitted Reynard. ‚ÄúBetter off asking Dara about that sort of thing. She arrived ahead of me, didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù  
‚ÄúAh, Deputy Shelly, good egg that one, bright girl. Came up here with that wildman of yours in tow, she did.‚Äù

Reynard scowled at the epithet. While Meadowfolk and Woodfolk were branches of the same tree, they were often at odds with each other, given their differing ways of life. That estrangement had only deepened with the ongoing Nexian Reformations, which favored the Meadowfolk. The Nexians considered the Meadowfolk to be ‚Äòmore civilized‚Äô than their ‚Äòbackward‚Äô cousins, and some Meadowfolk had taken it to heart, branding the Woodfolk as ‚Äòwildmen‚Äô.  
‚ÄúRabbit does honest work for the constabulary, Eamon. No need for that kind of talk.‚Äù  
‚ÄúPfah, what‚Äôs the lie in calling him a wildman, with his antlers looking like a tangle of brambles, and all that poppycock dangling from them?‚Äù  
‚ÄúNo lie at all, Farmer Burley,‚Äù Rabbit interjected suddenly, emerging from both men‚Äôs blind spots, as if appearing out of thin air.

To his credit, Reynard only flinched in surprise, while Eamon let out an undignified yelp. Rabbit stood before them, clad in his usual mottled leathers and woodsman‚Äôs gear. While Eamon‚Äôs description of Rabbit‚Äôs antlers was uncharitable, there was a kernel of truth to it. Woodfolk let their antlers grow free and untrimmed, favoring asymmetry, and decorated them with all manner of charms and talismans. The result was a vibrant mess that they proudly wore like crowns, a stark contrast to the well-trimmed and modestly decorated antlers of the Meadowfolk.

‚ÄúMorning Sarge, Farmer,‚Äù greeted the smirking ranger. Most of the local Woodfolk had taken to calling Reynard ‚ÄòSarge‚Äô due to former military rank. Woodfolk were odd like that with names. By their reckoning, ‚ÄòSarge‚Äô was a name with real power behind it, a title earned by blood and deed. Not quite up to Nexian standards of professionalism, but things were a bit more relaxed out in the frontier realms.  
‚ÄúMorning, Rabbit. Starting the day with a bit of stalking practice?‚Äù Reynard replied, pretending to not have been taken by surprise.  
""Oh, I weren't even trying. Easy work, coming up quiet on someone when their mind‚Äôs looking elsewhere,"" drawled Rabbit. ""But that‚Äôs not the story you want, so I‚Äôll tell you the other. I was up on the roof, getting light prints of the mess in the fields. Dara‚Äôs out there having a closer look. Also spotted a bit of sheep track heading out to the grasslands.‚Äù  
‚ÄúOh! Right, I damn near forgot, I‚Äì‚Äù  
‚ÄúShould come along so we can find those poor blighters and get them safely home. Fair plan, right?‚Äù Eamon could only mumble in agreement as Rabbit led him off to track down his lost sheep. Reynard tipped an imaginary cap to Rabbit in thanks.¬†

**Survey Station Selene, Observation Deck**

Senior Technician Cristian Mendez heaved a sigh, taking in the stunning view from the observation deck. A vast starfield stretched out before him, a dazzling array of celestial jewels glittering against the cold void of space. The station was located on the dark side of Caedwyn‚Äôs moon, meaning planet-rise wasn‚Äôt visible to them, but Mendez preferred starfields anyway. ‚ÄúSure is pretty out there. Damn shame it‚Äôs a damn death trap,‚Äù he thought aloud. Someone chuckled behind him. ‚ÄúKinda like deep sea facilities, y‚Äôknow? Surrounded by wonder and mystery that‚Äôll kill you dead if you stepped out into it,‚Äù they commented.

Mendez turned to see Drone Operations Specialist Joseph Anders, his coworker and long-time friend. ‚ÄúMore or less, yeah. At least we get bigger windows,‚Äù he replied, waving to Anders.  
‚ÄúFlying drones are cooler than submersibles too, if you ask me,‚Äù said Anders, handing Mendez a cup of coffee.  
‚ÄúSpeaking of, wanna head to the Ops Center? Next flight is in 30, with a new rotation. Might be better to get there early to make sure the prep‚Äôs done right,‚Äù suggested Mendez, tilting his head in the direction of the Remote Drone Operations Center.  
‚ÄúDamn, that‚Äôs right, double rotations after the brass went on the warpath. Let‚Äôs hop to it, then.‚Äù¬†

The pair set off to their workplace, sipping their drinks while continuing their conversation. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd that debrief go, by the way?‚Äù asked Anders. Earlier in the day, Mendez had gone through a marathon of a debriefing with the higher-ups, covering the system-wide glitch that caused all the commotion planetside. It was a dubious reward for not only being the ‚Äòfirst responder‚Äô to the whole mess, but also managing the ensuing damage control and cleanup operations.  
‚ÄúYou know how it goes, good work gets rewarded with more work,‚Äù answered Mendez, which got a nod of understanding from Anders. He continued, ‚ÄúOn the plus side, they were all ears when I outlined the cleanup and retrieval plans, and they seem to be on board with playing things safer now.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll say they‚Äôre on board,‚Äù agreed Anders, grinning. ‚ÄúWord is that the computer janitors who screwed up are getting extra special attention from an oversight committee. Plus, total rollback of automated systems, manual operation with max supervision for all missions going forward.‚Äù  
Mendez nodded, his expression hardening. ‚ÄúAbout damn time. We‚Äôve been over-reliant on the locals‚Äô ignorance of Earth tech to stay invisible. These folks aren‚Äôt stupid. Give ‚Äòem enough clues, and they‚Äôre gonna figure out what to look for, and where. Throw all that magic bullshit into the mix and we‚Äôre a coin flip away from our work becoming damn near impossible. High time we got back to playing it safe and using our damn heads.‚Äù  
‚ÄúLook at you, all responsible and shit. Relax, all the code monkeys and their shiny toys got sent packing. We‚Äôre calling the shots until the dust settles,‚Äù reasoned Anders, which got a shrug from Mendez.  
‚ÄúYeah, I suppose that‚Äôs something. After we put out these fires, we can start pushing for some sane best practices. Speaking of cleanup though, I‚Äôve got some plans that I need to go over with you.‚Äù  
Anders raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThat sounds like more work, Cris. I already got an entire wing of drone jocks to babysit.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYeah, but this is about scooping up all the physical evidence and covering our tracks, including the stuff the locals might have in lockup. Just a big ol‚Äô heist movie, figured you might be interested, buddy.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWell shit, you know just how to bait that hook, dontcha? All right boss, lemme hear this cleanup plan of yours‚Ä¶‚Äù

**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia, Burley Farm**

With Rabbit keeping Eamon occupied, Reynard was free to seek out his deputy, Dara Shelly. If anyone would be able to make head or tail of this bedlam, it would be her. Dara‚Äôs meticulous nature and arcane expertise made her well suited for the task. Her mana aptitude pushed the boundaries of the gifted commoners, but sadly fell short of the admissions requirements of the regional Academy of Magical Arts. It was the Academy's loss, by Reynard's reckoning. Dara had a keen mind in addition to her arcane talents, and had proven time and again to be a valuable member of the constabulary. If those gilded robes at the Academy failed to see her worth, they could go boil their heads for all he cared.

Looking around, Reynard spotted a woman with short-cropped red hair and severely trimmed antlers walking about the fields, taking notes and collecting samples. ""Hoi, Dara! Find anything?"" he called out as he approached her.  
""Nothing of note. Well, compared to all of this,"" She was standing in a perfect circle of trampled stalks, one of many that scarred Burley's fields. Beyond the circles were also concentric¬† rings, equally precise, as well as myriad geometric shapes, all connected by lines of varying width. Dara made a sweeping gesture, explaining, ""Same as all the other reports, a series of intricate patterns, joined by these straight lines in an irregular loop.""  
""Hm, looks like they were going in circles when they trampled the grain,‚Äù said Reynard, looking at the way the flattened pearl-grain lay on the ground. ‚ÄúSome kind of ritual, then?"" he asked.  
Dara shook her head in response. ""No, ritual magic requires consistent invocation patterns, but these are too haphazard. It‚Äôs all a jumble of circles, rings, and lines. If it‚Äôs following a pattern, it‚Äôs not an arcane one.""  
""Well, Nexian magic needs regular patterns anyway,"" Reynard mused. ""But it doesn't look like Druidic magic either. Druid runework is all... wibbly-wobbly, right?"" Reynard wiggled his fingers for emphasis, earning a scowl from Dara.  
""All wibbly-wobbly? Honestly Sheriff, would it kill you to use proper terminology?"" she grumbled. ""Technically you're right, though. This isn't anything like the vine and bough patterns of Woodfolk ritual magic,"" she continued. ""It's exceedingly strange. All of the individual parts of the pattern are remarkably precise. But when taken as a whole, they're complete nonsense,"" muttered Dara to herself.  
""Well there you go, we'll put a warrant out for an insane geometer with improbably large tools,"" joked Reynard.  
‚ÄúAcademicians run amok, may His Eternal Majesty deliver us,‚Äù deadpanned Dara in response. They shared a chuckle as Dara continued taking measurements and samples.

Reynard took a closer look at the trampled stalks while speaking to Dara. On its own, it was simple enough to figure out. Something heavy had come along and crushed the stalks flat. A group of strong youths with a wooden beam and a length of rope could have done the job, probably. No, what made this such a mystery was how swiftly the culprits had managed to do their work so swiftly in so many places, seemingly all at the same time. There was also the matter of the witnesses swearing up and down that they neither saw nor felt any spellwork being woven during the incidents. ‚ÄúIt is a bit odd though, that nobody with the Sight felt any magic during all this commotion,‚Äù mused Reynard.¬†  
Dara huffed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me started on the nonsense that‚Äôs been going around,‚Äù she growled. ‚ÄúCan you imagine? Something of the size they described going airborne without the aid of magic?‚Äù Dara shot to her feet and jabbed a finger skyward. ‚ÄúNot just airborne, mind you, but so high up the ‚Äòhexfire‚Äô blinked out, like it shot past the bloody Tapestry!‚Äù  
Reynard stifled a laugh, and ventured, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs not too likely this was something mundane?‚Äù

He swore she‚Äôd start shooting plumes of fire from her eyes, from the look she was giving him. As the constabulary‚Äôs most mana-gifted member, Dara did tend to get into a lather about the particulars of the magical arts. This hexfire business in particular was doing her head in, what with damn near everything about the incidents defying common sense. Dara took a deep breath, looking like she was about to let loose with a rant, but then thought better of it and slowly exhaled instead.¬†  
‚ÄúRight then, I‚Äôm not saying the witnesses are lying, or that they‚Äôre necessarily wrong,‚Äù she began, reining in her frustration. ‚ÄúThe issue is that it‚Äôs irresponsible to fall back on fantastical notions like manaless artifices, as if mundane forces could somehow rival the power of mana. Just because you don‚Äôt see the mana fields moving, doesn‚Äôt mean you can just throw out the fundamental order of the world,‚Äù she explained.  
Reynard nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as you often say, nothing happens in contradiction to the natural order,‚Äù he began.  
‚ÄúThey are merely in contradiction to what we currently know of the natural order, exactly,‚Äù she finished, smiling. ‚ÄúSounds like you‚Äôve been paying attention to my ‚Äòunofficial lectures‚Äô at least,‚Äù she added with a laugh.  
‚ÄúContrary to popular belief, I can be taught,‚Äù quipped Reynard with a wry grin. ‚ÄúBut getting back to the issue. If there is magic at play, but nobody sensed it, what‚Äôs the more reasonable explanation? Some kind of concealment?‚Äù  
‚ÄúConcealment is one option we can look into. You see, according to current literature‚Ä¶‚Äù

""Hey Mendez, check it out, it's Sheriff Rey-Rey and my homegirl Dara!"" said Anders excitedly, pointing to an infil-drone video feed of the Sheriff and his deputy. As persons of interest in the ongoing cleanup operations, the constabulary were under regular surveillance most of the time, and as such enjoyed minor celebrity status among the drone operators.  
""Christ, Anders. They're not a bunch of hypernet streamers, can the parasocial crap,"" replied Mendez.  
""Look, I'm a simple man. I see a redhead, I subscribe.""  
""Like you‚Äôve got a shot, fanboy. Anything new with the law?""  
""Still the usual bagging and tagging of evidence, and interviewing witnesses. Basic police work, by the book stuff. Sheriff Rey, Dara, and Rabbit are scoping out the Burley farm, and we‚Äôve got Baldie and Socks checking out a livestock mutilation out on the plains.‚Äù  
‚ÄúHm. And the Sheriff already swung by Splitskull?‚Äù  
‚ÄúYep, though he only dealt with Gladys‚Äô goons, not the Hag herself. Her Ladyship was busy with other matters, apparently, and there was no sign of her outside,‚Äù explained Anders.  
‚ÄúShit, that can‚Äôt be good. The geological survey drone came back with a couple worms missing, didn‚Äôt it?‚Äù asked Mendez, referring to the burrowing sample collector robots that the survey drones deployed to take core samples over a given area.  
‚ÄúUnfortunately, yeah. How much you wanna bet ol‚Äô Gladys got her claws on one of ‚Äòem?‚Äù  
‚ÄúOne of ‚Äòem? That old bitch has got her half of the mountain sewn up tighter than a Vac-U-Seal bag. She‚Äôs gotta have snagged both, no question.‚Äù  
‚ÄúAll right, what kind of money you got on the failsafes actually working?‚Äù  
‚ÄúSo what if they did? The electronics and servos would be slagged, but that still leaves them with a bunch of goodies to play with. Space-age alloys, precision machined parts, hell, the cutting heads on those things alone would probably make ‚Äòem shit a brick.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWelp, better start brainstorming on what we‚Äôre gonna do for Operation Claim Jumper‚Ä¶‚Äù

**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Western Agricultural Annexia**

A few minutes' ride from the Burley farm, Constables Daruth Val‚ÄôGed and Elwin Redfoot, better known as Baldie and Socks, were performing their duties in the wake of the hexfire‚Äôs rampage. They were currently investigating another incident site, similar to the others but with an alarmingly grisly difference: an eviscerated sheep lay splayed out in the middle of the strange pattern pressed into the plains grass. Socks was currently investigating the carcass. He was no stranger to gore, being a huntsman, but the display still managed to unnerve him with how bizarre it was.¬†

While he wasn‚Äôt the best student of magic, nothing he saw here resembled any of the rituals from the elders‚Äô teachings. It didn‚Äôt even look like outlander magic, like what the Nexians used. The body itself harbored more mysteries. Scavengers had gnawed and mangled it some, shifting some parts from where they once sat, but a proper look revealed more. Scorch and puncture marks no wider than a knitting needle dotted the body, whether by chance or intent, he couldn‚Äôt say. The body had been cut open long before the vermin had gotten to it, surely with a magical blade. That was the only tool that could have left such clean and neat edges on flesh and bone alike.¬†

As for the innards, it looked like the culprit took their pick of the organs, snatching up the heart, liver, left kidney, and a good arm‚Äôs length of guts. The stomachs were cast to the side, each one punctured and emptied for gods only knew what reason. Socks couldn‚Äôt tell if this phantom butcher was a master or a madman. Whatever the culprit‚Äôs nature, Dara would definitely want to take a closer look at this. Weighing his options, he elected to bag up the carcass as evidence, seeing as carrion eaters had already run roughshod all over the scene. He silently cursed himself for not asking for the wagon.

Behind him, Baldie was interviewing Old Hob, the shepherd who had apparently witnessed the incident, but Baldie had serious doubts about that. He was trying his best to not let the cranky old cuss embarrass himself, but he was having quite the time of it. ‚ÄúAll right Hob, let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôve got this right,‚Äù began Baldie, his brow furrowed in consternation. Hob glared back at him. ‚ÄúYou were out late at night, rounding up some strays that got loose, when suddenly some‚Ä¶ thing‚Äì‚Äù  
""It were them witch-lights, a whole swarm of ‚Äòem! I told you thrice already!‚Äù  
‚ÄúRight, so down they come, shining light in your eyes. After blinding you, they snatch up the strays and leave you out on the plains.‚Äù  
‚ÄúAye, I sent up a signal too, but you lawmen showed up all slow like!‚Äù  
‚ÄúWe were busy, Hob. You weren‚Äôt the only one with‚Ä¶ troubles last night,‚Äù countered Baldie. ‚ÄúIn any case, by the time the night watch arrived, the strays had come back to you. So what‚Äôs all the fuss about, then?‚Äù  
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre marked by the hexfire, they are! A dark pall hangs o‚Äôer them!‚Äù  
‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why you decided to shear them down to the bare hide?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWell, how else was I s‚Äôposed to reveal the dark marks?‚Äù

Baldie glanced over at the shorn sheep. If they were in the thrall of some otherworldly force, they weren‚Äôt showing it. They were currently grazing on a patch of clover, blissfully unaware of the drama unfolding around them, making Baldie feel a pang of envy. Socks approached to join them, having completed the bloody business of packing up the evidence. He spoke to Hob while wiping his hands off on a rag.¬†  
‚ÄúKeep your velvet on, Hob. How about this, we‚Äôll bring ‚Äòem to the chattel physick to take a look-see. If he gives the all clear, you have to take ‚Äòem back, and if something‚Äôs amiss, we‚Äôll square away the price with you. All right?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWhatever suits you, just get ‚Äòem away from me. I don‚Äôt feel safe, knowing they‚Äôre watching me for their dark master. Who knows what they‚Äôre plotting?‚Äù hissed the old man, shaking his fist at the sheep. Baldie and Socks looked at the still oblivious animals, grazing away without a care in the world, then back to Hob. They were clearly unimpressed.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre unclean, I tell you! Unclean!‚Äù insisted Hob, jabbing his finger at one of the supposed agents of the dark powers.

As if on cue, the sheep farted. Baldie and Socks remained unimpressed.

**Survey Station Selene, Remote Drone Operations Center**

‚ÄúGoddammit,‚Äù said Mendez with a tired sigh, watching Baldie and Socks on the screen as they led away their newly acquired sheep. ‚ÄúSo we got three tracker-tagged sheep literally getting booked by the cops. What the hell is a ‚Äòchattel physick‚Äô? Some kind of country vet or something?‚Äù  
‚ÄúYeah, a vet for farm animals, if I remember right. We‚Äôve probably got a file on the guy and where his place is at. I‚Äôll include it in the mission prep materials. Are we running a mission to get ‚Äòem back?‚Äù  
‚ÄúDepends. What did the drone stick ‚Äòem with? Standard tracker, or a full on sensor package?‚Äù  
Tapping on his keyboard, Anders scanned his screen for the information. ‚ÄúLooks like they got the fauna biometrics tracking suite,‚Äù he said, wincing. He rattled off the specs, ‚ÄúSix low profile capsules, four subdermal, two intramuscular.‚Äù  
‚ÄúOh for fuck‚Äôs sake,‚Äù lamented Mendez, cradling his head in his hands. ‚ÄúThe hell kind of retrieval mission do we fly for something like this?‚Äù  
‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you the one who said it‚Äôd be like a big ol‚Äô heist movie? Think of it as a challenge! I can see it now, The Great Mutton Caper!‚Äù  
‚Äú*No manches* Mutton Caper! I oughta make mutton outta you, *cabron*,‚Äù grumbled Mendez.  
‚ÄúAw c‚Äômon, look on the bright side, we‚Äôll know exactly where they are at any given time, thanks to the trackers. That‚Äôs more than we can say for those missing driller bots,‚Äù replied Anders with a grin.¬†

Mendez remained unamused.

**Late Evening**  
**Caedwyn Realm, Consolidated Frontier Territories**  
**Miller‚Äôs Hollow, Municipal Guardhouse**

Reynard looked up from his ledger, glancing around the guardhouse offices. Flanking him were Baldie and Sam, busy with a stack of reports each. The three of them were handling paperwork, compiling witness testimonies for filing later. Dara and Socks were examining the animal remains and other perishable items. Rabbit and Belkund were in the evidence locker, tagging and sorting the rest of the items. They had burned every minute of daylight gathering everything they could in the wake of the hexfire sightings, and that was only half the job done. Now they had to attend to teasing apart the tangled account of events, and knit it back into a coherent and orderly telling. That‚Äôs what the Administratum would demand, and Reynard fully understood the risks of defying this expectation.¬†

The Nexian officials staffing the Administratum would be especially displeased with how the strange events seemed to be reviving old superstitions. Phrases like 'hexfire' were remnants of the past, rooted in the old magics of the realm, before the Nexians papered over the 'backward superstitions of ignorant rustics' with more civilized magical arts. The Nexians were accustomed to a newrealm‚Äôs old ways retreating to the margins of history, while the Nexus busily penned new chapters with grand, sweeping strokes.

Such gusto often placed a great deal of pressure on the local populace and their leaders. So far, the Nexians were content to push their Reformations at a gradual but steady pace. But Reynard knew their patience would not last forever. Soon enough, they would become much more insistent and far less polite. His time in the military taught him just how insistent and impolite the Empire could be. Not wanting to dwell further on such thoughts, Reynard busied himself with his paperwork once more.

I have always been the kind of person that yoyo's between an immaculately clean house and a level 5 hurricane where you have to step over random items to navigate a room. From what I could tell before we got married my wife was similar and you can imagine that when we began living together that didn't really change. I've always known that I share fairly equal blame for causing these messes so I never brought it up with her. Who am I to ask you to be cleaner when I haven't figured it out for myself?

Two years ago we had our first child and we decided that I would stay at home with baby and my wife would continue in her career. This meant that I would also take on the bulk of the responsibility when it came to keeping the house in order(ie cooking, cleaning, etc) because she wouldn't have as much time to do so. I've been happy and content with this arrangement and I feel that we have fairly equally split the load of life between us. 

This is the part  where I might be the asshole. Since having a child I have worked much harder to keep the house in a more consistently clean state and I feel proud of the personal changes I've been able to make in doing so, but being the one mainly responsible for cleaning has meant that I am often cleaning up after my wife. I don't have an issue with the idea of cleaning up her messes within reason, but I really feel like she could be putting more effort into cleaning up after herself or at least putting things away when she is done with them. 

A few examples of what I mean

- when she is done making her coffee in the morning she leaves with handle on, coffee grounds in, dirty unrinsed mug in the maker, and milk all over the frothing wand. This makes for a tough cleanup when I go to clean and everything is dried and caked on.

- leaving dishes, garbage, clothes, etc all over the house.

- leaving plates, cups, cutlery, etc and leaving crumbs or similar food mess on the couch and other surfaces after eating a meal.

- getting a bunch of toys, paint supplies, coloring books etc out to play with our son and then leaving it all out. 

I understand that I have agreed to be the person in charge of keeping our home clean, but it really feels like she could make my job a lot easier with a minimal amount of effort. Whenever I have tried to talk to her about this though (many times) she agrees, apologizes, and nothing changes. 

I feel guilty asking her to change this when I know I have very similar flaws. I also feel guilty because I agreed to be in charge of the state of our house. 

Should I just suck it up and clean because it's my responsibility? 

Is there a better way to go about talking about this with her?

*As the predominantly Asian American church network expands to dozens of college towns, former members come forward with claims of spiritual abuse.*

Update (August 15, 2023): Gracepoint Ministries, formerly Gracepoint Church,¬†[has rebranded](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.acts2.network/about/our-story)¬†as Acts2 Network. The group‚Äôs website states that ‚Äúthe scope of our ministries is such that our original local church‚Äôs name no longer adequately captures who we are.‚Äù The church's highly coordinated top-down organization structure will shift to a more ‚Äúlocally-led, centrally-supported model‚Äù while still maintaining its ‚Äúcore DNA.‚Äù

The ministry has also clarified expectations around its ‚Äú[Way of Life](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.acts2.network/way-of-life),‚Äù which includes a ‚Äúdefault position of support‚Äù for leaders and adopting a ‚Äúcommon calendar.‚Äù Noting that Pastor Ed Kang and his wife, Kelly, are now in their 60s, the ministry says it is ‚Äúrestructuring to prepare for a future transition to the next generation of leaders.‚Äù

Gracepoint Church checks all the boxes of a college ministry success story.

Founded in 1981 around the concept of whole-life discipleship, the church‚Äîthen known as Berkland Baptist‚Äîestablished itself as a home for Asian American students attending the University of California, Berkeley. With the mission to plant ‚Äúan Acts 2 church in every college town,‚Äù Gracepoint stands out among¬†[the loose network](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://nyupress.org/9780814747902/gods-new-whiz-kids/)¬†of predominantly Asian American college churches that pepper campuses across the West Coast and beyond.

Located on over 60 campuses, it has launched church plants in 35 cities nationwide, as well as one in Taiwan, with 15 new churches planted in 2021 alone.

At campus clubs like Klesis and Acts2Fellowship, Gracepoint pushes college students to wrestle with tough questions and pursue church mentorship. At graduation, it encourages young Christians to live life on mission by joining staff at one of its campuses or helping launch a new one. Staying at Gracepoint has a strong appeal, echoing the coming-of-age films that ask,¬†*Why can‚Äôt college last forever?*

‚ÄúI guess you could say we were just a bunch of people who enjoyed college life so much that we never left it,‚Äù the church quips in a¬†[promotional video](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlbN8MtjN4&feature=youtu.be).

‚ÄúI think people experience a spiritual vibrancy and potency and just a warmth and depth of relationship with God that they haven‚Äôt experienced elsewhere,‚Äù said Michael Kim, a member at the church‚Äôs Santa Barbara campus who was raised at Gracepoint. ‚ÄúFor serving members, it‚Äôs high pressure, high labor, high toil, but high gratification.‚Äù

But many who were involved in Gracepoint say the church‚Äôs desire to pursue radical living, coupled with the pace of its ministry, has come at a cost‚Äîits members.

‚ÄúThey do good, but the process in which they enforce that good is spiritually abusive,‚Äù said Joshua Mun, a former member who grew up attending the Berkeley church and served at various Gracepoint church plants throughout his 20s.

Thirty-two former Gracepoint members who spoke with¬†*Christianity Today*¬†for this story described a culture that was ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù and ‚Äúcoercive‚Äù for the sake of ministry efficiency.

Members said they were manipulated into confessing sins, screamed at by leaders, and overloaded with obligations to the point of illness. To keep members focused on mission work, Gracepoint effectively restricted dating, media consumption, and pet ownership. Leaders directed staff on how to arrange their homes, where to shop for clothes, and what cars to drive.

‚ÄúMy leader‚Äôs words were like the words of God,‚Äù said Mun, who left the church last year due in part to anxiety. ‚ÄúI viewed God as this incredibly sensitive, temperamental, judgmental being. I‚Äôm one sin away from him dropping the hammer and smiting me, because that‚Äôs what my leaders were representing to me.‚Äù

Gracepoint has faced decades of criticism from members who left its ranks, but allegations drew new attention last year on a channel of the message board site¬†[Reddit](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/). Posters allege they were¬†[belittled by church leaders](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://web.archive.org/web/20220226000204/Www.Reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/t1h5ao/calling_me_a_dog/), encouraged to¬†[take on credit card debt](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/o2hgo5/credit_card_debt_email/)¬†to fund ministry expenses, and slandered after¬†[choosing to leave the church](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/pp7htb/gracepoint_ignores_and_discredits_all_those_who/).

‚ÄúI am very sorry for those who feel they have experienced harm under our ministry,‚Äù wrote Ed Kang, the church‚Äôs senior pastor and network leader, in an email response to questions sent by CT. Kang said he would be ‚Äúeager to hear from them so that we can seek healing, apologize when necessary, and seek reconciliation.‚Äù

A regional director for the church, Daniel Kim (no relation to Michael Kim), shared his contact information on the forum, asking those looking for ‚Äúpersonal reconciliation‚Äù to reach out. He told CT that eight people have contacted him since he first posted in April 2021.

Over the course of CT reporting this article, Gracepoint has begun to rethink aspects of its ministry style and implement reforms. Kang told CT the church is focusing on ‚Äúdialing down the excellence‚Äù in response to internal reflection and public criticism.

‚ÄúOne conclusion was that a lot of our relationships have been disrupted because of our church planting efforts,‚Äù Kang said. ‚ÄúWe have been too task oriented, trying to do a lot with fewer people and thinned-out relationships.‚Äù

Yet even when acknowledging former members‚Äô hurt, leaders have prioritized the¬†[damage they‚Äôve done to Gracepoint‚Äôs ministry](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/syzdcr/a_plea_from_gracepoint/)¬†by making their grievances public.

On a¬†[new church podcast](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfAkZ0jJ6RkfMZqaJVCqWNA)¬†launched last month, Isaiah Kang, Ed‚Äôs son, said anonymous posters are ‚Äúnot messengers from heaven.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúWhatever else may be true‚Äîyou may be wronged, you probably were wronged‚Äîthat doesn‚Äôt make what you do right.‚Äù

While college ministries like InterVarsity and Asian American Christian Fellowship were launching programs to serve a growing wave of Asian immigrants and second-generation Asian Americans, Rebekah and Paul Kim (no relation to the other Kims)¬†[planted a church](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/fall-2009-constant-change/new-believers/)¬†to minister to Korean Americans at UC Berkeley in 1981. On the border of Berkeley and Oakland, the church was named Berkland Baptist.

Berkland members bonded as both Christians and Korean Americans, often referring to older church members by Korean honorifics‚Äî*hyung*¬†for older brother and¬†*noona*¬†for older sister.

‚ÄúOne of the things that‚Äôs good about the Korean culture is that when someone wants you close to them, they make you part of their family,‚Äù said a former longtime Berkland member who asked not to be named due to his close ties with Gracepoint leadership. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just a fellow brother in Christ; you are really my brother. You‚Äôre my true family. Those kinds of values were considered essential as part of the church.‚Äù

That familial attitude tied into the church‚Äôs model of whole-life discipleship. Like many college ministries where young adults commit to codes of conduct, accountability, and community obligations, Berkland attracted Asian American students with its strict but tight-knit ministry philosophy.

They joined the church, paired with disciplers for mentorship, fervently studied Scripture, and evangelized on their campuses, seeing more added to the church. (Because of the church‚Äôs focus on college ministry, leaders discouraged members from inviting coworkers or neighbors who were out of college.)

By getting involved in Berkland, and later Gracepoint, students were expected to forgo the typical liberties associated with college life. The church‚Äôs guidelines were enforced not as rules but as ‚Äústances‚Äù and ‚Äúvalues.‚Äù

Undergraduate students were discouraged from dating and, in some cases, forced to break up. (The church is reconsidering its stance against dating, Kang said.) When disciplers approved of a dating relationship, both parties were still expected to keep it private. Half a dozen former members recalled learning that couples were together only upon receiving wedding invitations.

When they became part of the ministry team, Gracepoint members were required to install internet filtering software like Covenant Eyes on their devices. Leaders could track screen time not just to check for pornography but also to discourage users from listening to K-pop or watching too much ESPN. Kang told CT the church tries to mitigate ‚Äúthe effects of the media-entertainment complex and tech companies‚Äù and has historically discouraged the use of televisions and social media.

According to Len Tang, director of the Church Planting Initiative at Fuller Theological Seminary, high-pressure churches like Gracepoint often enforce a ‚Äúmethodological purity‚Äù within their ministry.

‚ÄúA methodological purity might say that college ministry must be done in a specific way. You have to disciple them in a particular way, or you need to isolate them or separate them from certain influences,‚Äù Tang said.

Young members were being discipled to follow not only the Bible but also the church‚Äôs culture‚Äîwhat was acceptable, what was lauded by their leaders as signs of their devotion. And when they violated those expectations, often unknowingly, the results could be explosive.

Paul Lee said his pastor at UC Riverside called to yell at him for having coffee with a female friend on staff, which he had done before but didn‚Äôt know was frowned on. ‚ÄúHe jumped so quickly to scolding me, really making sure I was in this posture of shame,‚Äù Lee said.

Documents from 2011 taught church leaders to rebuke members ‚Äúso that the person gets to have proper fear toward God & proper shock over what he has done,‚Äù with the trainer modeling screaming and slamming the table, according to former staff. Kang said such rebukes are infrequent and such training couldn‚Äôt be used now with the ‚Äúanxiety and emotional fragility‚Äù of today‚Äôs generation.

These outbursts shamed members for not following the standards of their community. But what might have felt like conviction from God at the moment they later saw as the leaders‚Äô aggression.

One Thanksgiving, Austin Lee (no relation to Paul) was berated for not tithing enough after moving cross-country to help plant a church at the University of North Carolina without consistent employment. Pastor Richard Tjhen told CT he became ‚Äúagitated and annoyed‚Äù because Austin Lee was defensive during their conversation. Tjhen said that his own actions were ‚Äútotally inappropriate and not our church policy.‚Äù

>""I realized I was never going to be able to prove that I was taking my sins seriously.""

Members under discipline could be asked to refrain from serving in ministries and even attending services. But their restoration hinged on the whims of Gracepoint leaders, with the process sometimes dragging out and involving assignments to repent with written reflections and confessions. Kang said that a ‚Äúperiod of withdrawal‚Äù from ministry can be appropriate, but the practice of writing reflections has tapered off over the years.

The Berkland network¬†[disbanded](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/nkbx1r/eds_letter_to_becky_2005_after_discussion_with/)¬†in 2006, and the Berkeley and Davis churches rebranded as Gracepoint, eventually planting churches in college cities and towns beyond California. Under Kang‚Äôs leadership, Gracepoint campuses offered near-identical weekly¬†[programming](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/http://www.course101.org/), down to¬†[recipe](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/http://www.dishgracepoint.com/)¬†recommendations.

Commitment to church ordered all of life: Tabulated spreadsheets organized staff schedules by the hour, often stretching late into evenings and weekends. Members realized their schedules were no longer their own. They were expected to ask permission to go on vacation or visit their families, former members said.

‚ÄúI had a strained relationship with my parents,‚Äù said Martin Loekito, who was a member of Gracepoint‚Äôs Davis church for 14 years. ‚ÄúI could never spend time with them without feeling like I needed to get away, like I needed to be back at church.‚Äù

Another former member, Elaine Huang, said church leaders called her ‚Äúselfish‚Äù when she opted to visit her parents in Taiwan the summer after her graduation from UC Berkeley in the early 2010s. Arguing that her parents were already saved and therefore required less of her attention, Huang‚Äôs leaders convinced her to cut her months-long trip short to participate in the church‚Äôs fall outreach.

For Loekito and others, the church‚Äôs warning of idolizing the family carried into married life. Loekito said his eldest daughter spent large portions of her early childhood at the church‚Äôs babysitting ministry while he and his wife were participating in events.

‚ÄúWhen we left \[the church\], she was a year and a half old, and I kind of felt like it was a lost time,‚Äù he said, recollecting on missing his daughter‚Äôs first words and steps. ‚ÄúJust having dinner, everyone at the same table‚Äîthat was very rare.‚Äù

Years of ‚Äúwhole-life discipleship‚Äù took a toll. Paul Lee, the former Riverside church member, experienced ‚Äúphysically debilitating‚Äù stress that caused stomachaches, headaches, and frequent panic attacks. Despite bringing his symptoms to his leaders, he said he was not allowed to step back from most of his church responsibilities.

‚ÄúI think it was at that point when I realized that \[the church\] really did not care for my well-being,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúThey cared more that I was staying and being a productive sort of functioning member.‚Äù

In his CT response, Kang said the church has implemented changes including a monthly ‚Äúsabbath week‚Äù when members are required to break from all formal ministry.

In an internal survey of 1,004 Gracepoint members late last year, 37 percent viewed the church primarily as a family, 34 percent viewed it as an army, and 29 percent viewed it as a factory.

Whole-life discipleship did in fact extend to every area of life. According to emails from former leaders, members were asked to change their wardrobe (‚ÄúI think I need to get some odd clothes out of \[this member‚Äôs\] closet too so she doesn‚Äôt get tempted to keep wearing them.‚Äù), dietary habits (‚ÄúI found out \[that you\] regularly eat late at night. I think you need to really curb that. I have noticed that you are looking more and more unhealthy lately.‚Äù), and living spaces (‚ÄúI was appalled once again to hear that your house has been like a pig sty. ‚Ä¶ Either your life is out of control or you are extremely lazy or you are extremely selfish.‚Äù).

Leaders might recommend specific pieces of home decor (the affordable¬†[Ikea Kallax](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kallax-shelf-unit-white-80275887/)) or clothes (modest yet tasteful Ann Taylor and Banana Republic). Members even purchased similar vehicles‚Äîthe Nissan Quest or Honda Odyssey, affordable minivans that could easily transport students and ministry supplies.

>37% of Gracepoint members viewed the church primarily as a family, 34% viewed it as an army, and 29% viewed it as a factory.

While oversight and granular life advice can be part of college formation and discipleship, Gracepoint‚Äôs influence grew more intrusive as members remained at the church. One member who attended Gracepoint Berkeley for 22 years worried that her involvement stunted her maturity.

‚ÄúOne of the things I‚Äôm learning now that I‚Äôm out \[of the church\] is that I can actually make my own decisions without checking with somebody, asking for permission, being afraid that I‚Äôll get in trouble,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI know it sounds weird. This is what a 20-year-old would realize, but here I am at 40 just realizing this now.‚Äù

Evangelical ministries eager for holistic, 24/7, ‚Äúall-of-life‚Äù discipleship have sometimes crossed boundaries into spiritual abuse, where members feel coerced and manipulated rather than guided and mentored. In 2020, Acts 29 CEO Steve Timmis¬†[was removed from leadership for his level of bullying and control.](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/february/acts-29-ceo-steve-timmis-removed-spiritual-abuse-tch.html)¬†The charismatic shepherding movement of the 1970s and ‚Äô80s ended with¬†[former leaders disavowing](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1990/march-19/shepherding-movement-idea-whose-time-has-gone.html)¬†their own intrusive practices. (Former Berkland members said founder Rebekah Kim was¬†[trained by University Bible Fellowship](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.reddit.com/r/GracepointChurch/comments/t74d8i/gracepoints_spiritual_heritage_university_bible/), a Korean offshoot of the shepherding movement.)

Six ex-Gracepoint staff said mental breakdowns contributed to their decisions to leave the church and, for some, the faith. Last year, Pete Nguyen left Gracepoint after experiencing severe depression and suicidal thoughts while attending.

Huang, the UC Berkeley student, said a church leader told her that her suicidal thoughts were because she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlove God enough.‚Äù She said this response pushed her to walk away from Christianity. The leader, Suzanne Suh, said she did not recall the conversation but ‚Äúwould not talk to someone who is suicidal using this type of approach or using these kinds of words.‚Äù

A former UC Santa Barbara student said her declining well-being‚Äîdepression and an eating disorder relapse‚Äîwas seen as evidence of her unrepentance after she crossed a physical boundary with her boyfriend. She was asked to write reflections and was repeatedly told that she had not seen the full reality of her sin.

‚ÄúThese constant assessments about me being unrepentant‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt reflect what I was actually thinking and feeling,‚Äù said Noelle, who is also an abuse survivor and asked CT not to use her last name due to her job as a teacher. ‚ÄúI realized I was never going to be able to prove that I was taking my sins seriously.‚Äù

Online criticism of the church‚Äôs high-pressure environment did not start with the Reddit posts. Anonymous blogs including¬†*Twisted Gracepoint*¬†and¬†[*The Truth about Gracepoint Church*](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://gracepoint-berkeley.blogspot.com/)¬†circulated online in the 2000s.

Emails obtained by CT show that Gracepoint maintained its own blogs to compete with those critiquing the church. Over the years, church members were told to avoid driving traffic to the online criticism and were instead encouraged to protect the church‚Äôs ‚Äúonline reputation.‚Äù At times, Gracepoint leaders asked staff and members to search and click on church webpages or positive blog posts at least three times a day to improve Google search rankings.

Church leaders were also encouraged to write positive Yelp reviews‚Äîand sometimes report negative ones. Both practices remain, especially in the ramp-up to fall quarter.

Gracepoint‚Äôs training documents teach staff to explain why the church‚Äôs ‚Äúhierarchical leadership‚Äù is ‚Äúnot authoritarian‚Äù or why negative perception of the church‚Äôs culture of rebuke is ‚Äúoverblown‚Äù due to ‚Äúan emotionally fragile generation.‚Äù Weary of internal programs being leaked, leaders asked members to periodically delete ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù recordings and emails containing talks and trainings or to watch them under supervision.

An FAQ page on Gracepoint‚Äôs website answered the question ‚Äú[Is Gracepoint a Cult?](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://web.archive.org/web/20220910014212/https://www.gracepointonline.org/is-gracepoint-a-cult)‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúNope, not really‚Äù‚Äîwhile dismissing ‚ÄúReddit trolls‚Äù and touting its Southern Baptist affiliation. (Kang previously sat on the¬†[advisory board](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.gracepointonline.org/partners)¬†for Send Network, the church planting arm of the Southern Baptists‚Äô North American Mission Board.

Some critics are taking their concerns offline. Several parents of former and current members, worried that the church is distancing them from their children, have raised concerns about the church‚Äôs fellowship groups to leaders at UC campuses and Biola University.

The University of San Francisco revoked the recognition status of Gracepoint‚Äôs Klesis fellowship in May 2021 because it ‚Äúdid not meet the requirements to be a USF affiliated ministry, misrepresented its relationship with Gracepoint Church, and continued to have contact with students‚Äù following an interim suspension issued in March. Kang confirmed the church no longer operates on the campus, though some students still attend the San Francisco location. He was unsure how the group may have misrepresented itself to the university.

For those who have left, connecting with other former members in person and online has helped their transition out of the church. Loekito, who left in 2019, said that the discussion has allowed him and his wife to process their experience, but reacclimating to a new church has been hard.

‚ÄúMy regrets are mostly about the people that I ministered to when I had no right to be called a minister,‚Äù Loekito said. ‚ÄúSome of them left, and I was able to reconnect with them and say I‚Äôm sorry for what I did to them. But the worst is those who are still there, young people who I told to defy their parents and throw away their ambitions and throw away their future to join the \[Gracepoint\] cause.‚Äù

Some former members said their departures were mischaracterized within the organization, with current attendees saying that those who left did so to ‚Äúpursue the world‚Äù by purchasing pets or getting Disneyland passes.

‚ÄúIt feels like the bridge is being burnt from the other end,‚Äù said Mun. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to negate the truth that God reached me through Gracepoint, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that Gracepoint is God‚Äôs heaven on earth.‚Äù

Gracepoint continues its evangelism efforts for the fall semester. Rebranding as Gracepoint Ministries, it has expanded Area Youth Ministry, a parachurch organization meant to evangelize middle- and high-school students and supplement church youth groups. The group operates in¬†[24 cities](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918043655/https://www.areayouth.org/locations), and according to Kang, Gracepoint staff are now split between college and noncollege ministries.

Nguyen, who left in 2021 after attending Gracepoint for a decade, has spoken at length with his former leaders at the Riverside and Pomona campuses, as well as with Daniel Kim, about the ways he felt wronged.

‚ÄúIf they really examine things, they really could change,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut I just don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre willing to let go of a lot of the practices they‚Äôve been holding on to.‚Äù

During an April 2021 sermon on one of the Beatitudes, Kang told the church not to be discouraged by their online critics; Jesus himself warned that detractors would ‚Äúutter all kinds of evil against you falsely‚Äù (Matt. 5:11, ESV).

‚ÄúClearly people who are posting are either genuinely grieved and wounded or so narcissistic that some small evil or injustice or wrong done to them is something utterly outrageous and they can‚Äôt move on,‚Äù Kang said.

‚ÄúOne thing that we must not do is be persuaded by criticism that there‚Äôs something wrong with us.‚Äù

Thinking About Working From Home? Watch This First
https://youtu.be/QND4JcLQpa4

‚Ä¢ Set up a dedicated workspace.

Even a small area that's just for work can help you mentally separate your job from the rest of your life.

‚Ä¢ Communicate boundaries with your significant other.

Talk about how your new routine may affect theirs and how to balance shared spaces.

‚Ä¢ Stay focused.

Whether it's coffee, tea, or whatever keeps you sharp, find what works best for you.

‚Ä¢ Move your body.

If you've been sitting for a while, get up and stretch or take a short walk. It's good for your mind and body.

‚Ä¢ Make sure you have enough light.

Natural light is ideal, but if that's not an option, try something like a light therapy device to stay alert and support your circadian rhythm.

**Wednesday - 22.01.25 (small mystical experience during flight)**  
Guys, I am a little bit sorry, that my posts are getting long even on my terms. However, I just want to get my thoughts out and maybe someone can relate to my journey better. And I also don‚Äôt want to make it quick and dirty, because it waters down the point of view.

**0305 - 0321: Meditation GOLOV + stretch**  
Thought about mum -> no feelings.  
Thought about grandmum -> feelings of love occured  
Why is it then I sometimes feel the love and sometimes I don't? I don't know yet.  
**0321 - 0336: Meditation generate gratitude + stretch**  
**0336 - 0350: Meditation generate empowerment + stretch**  
I don‚Äôt find the generating series to be effective for what they are for. All I feel is probably a sense of calm and being in the present moment. So instead of listening to these 15 mins meditation, I rather listen 7 times to a 2 min NLP technique, which actually lets me feel more joy. Maybe I will find something better on youtube.

My taxi to the airport arrived at 0430.  
2 minutes into the drive to the airport I noticed myself smiling for no reason at all. Why would I smile when I have go back to work now? Because I am whole. I kept on smiling the whole 30 min drive. I just listened to an audiobook, as I was waiting for boarding and during the first flight I fell alseep instantly.

At the next airport, I bought one overpriced coffee, which I usually never ever do.  This new me seems to be rich. After the coffee I looked for a place to meditate. I started with a lying down position to see how it goes. I was a little bit afraid about my stuff being stolen, so I put my passport and wallet into my jeans and placed my bag in between four seats. I meditated with Sony wh-1000xm4. I could still hear some stuff happening around me even with noise canceling but well. That‚Äôs life. F\*\*\* perfectionism. It is actually was good exercise to focus on the meditation as sounds appear, because it is the same with my own mind ""says"" someting.

**1326 - 1343: Meditation GOLOV**  
2 seconds into the meditation I was thinking ""what if I cry?"" and I checked my phone for other meditations for 5 seconds. Then I thought ""wtf am I doing? Nobody gives a f\*\*\* if I cry and nobody gives a f\*\*\* about me"". And I restarted GOLOV meditation. I thought about mum and grandmum and my eyes got watery a bit. I don‚Äôt know if it was visible for other people. And even if, nobody cares, because everybody is in their own fucking head imagining worst case scenarios. During the meditation I was thinking about visiting my grandmum in Estonia this year, since I am postponing this since 2016 or so.

**1346 - 1416: Meditation BOTEC 7 (1,5x speed)**  
I really had to pee. At 1416 I couldn‚Äôt hold on anymore. I took my stuff and went to the toilet. As I finished peeing, I asked myself should I lie down again or sit? As I came out, my place was occupied. ‚ÄûOkay I understand‚Äú I said to myself and sat down somewhere else continued meditating.  
During this meditation my 2nd energy center changed from a Dragon Ball into a tiger, whom also transforms into a humanoid form with the head of a tiger.  
Additionally my aligning and connecting of the energy centers changed. As the numbers of the energy centers are being said, my first center covers this energy center up by shooting up a wall of magma.

I went peeing after meditation, 10 min break listening to anything and went to the gate,

**1448 - 1514: Introduction BOTEC 2**  
As I listened to this introduction, I noticed that my ultra instinct of energy center 3 is ""wrong"". Because according to the introduction the gut feeling is energy center 2, not 3. However, I do not care about that now. My unconscious mind will tell me when to change energy centers 2 and 3.

Being in the plane I waited for the lift off, to imagine my new potential far away from me as a small picture and as the plane accelerated I moved this new potential towards me, making it bigger and brighter and bathing my self in this feeling of my new potential.

**1612 - 1646 finish: Meditation BOTEC 2 (1,5x speed)**  
The meditation was ok with 1,5x speed. From 3rd to 5th energy center I was thinking about something and I didn‚Äôt notice it. As 5 was said and I realized I was somewhere else with my mind and tuned back into meditation.  
Apart from that, I had to pee a little bit in the beginning. I didn‚Äôt go to toilet on purpose. I wanted to sit in the fire again. üòÇ

Right after the meditation I went peeing, came back and the stewardesses where one seat in front of me giving out food. Perfect timing I guess. I chilled for next minute and ate trying staying in present moment without thinking about anything. Apart from 3 thoughts, I succeeded staying in the present moment saying in my mind ‚Äûmmh mmh this tasty. Yes yes. Lalalala‚Äú lol. Don‚Äôt ask my why I did this, I guess my new self does this kind of stuff and doesn‚Äôt give a fuck anymore.  
And as I wrote this sentence, I remembered the time I went to the toilet on my last flight. I opened up the lid and there was some shit at the back of the toilet. I was like ‚Äûwell, shit‚Äú. Then I took 10 paper towels and wiped it away. After that I washed my hands three times imagining I would purify my hands with the hellfire from purgatory. That‚Äôs some ‚Äûbe in the unknown shit, right there‚Äú. I won‚Äôt say I loved this, but at least I know I changed. üòÇ

**1716 - 1743: Meditation changing box short + introduction**  
This meditation was so good.  
But first let me tell you something Dr. Joe said on a live stream (I paraphrase):  
*""When you are traveling, you are out of your usual habitat. This means you are in the unknown and this is the best time to meditate.""*

Now, back to my experience with the meditation.  
At first many thoughts came up and I had to fight to get back into the present moment. It went on and on until Dr. Joe says ‚Äûimagine a possibility, where your challenge doesn‚Äôt exit‚Äú. Then I remembered the infinite possibilities, which I visualized, while doing the changing boxes walking meditation once.

Everything is black. I only see an infinite number of white dots in this black see of nothingness. I saw this sea again in this meditation and before I finished conjuring up ‚Äûinfinite possibilities‚Äú (a lot of white dots so to speak), there was  one white dot already shining brightly like a guiding North Star and I was like ‚Äûoh cool. I will take that‚Äú then Dr. Joe instructs ‚Äûpull that future to you with your heart‚Äú and immediately I see Scorpion form mortal combat making his ‚Äû[get over here move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6z4lOuARtI)‚Äú throwing out a spear, which is connected to a string and in mortal combat the enemy will be pierced and get pulled over.

In the next second I was like ‚Äûwait. That‚Äôs too fierce. That‚Äôs not my enemy.‚Äú The next second Scorpion transformed into a gay guy and made the same move. Only the string was pink and at the end of the string was a pink heart. At the same time the gay guy says ‚Äûuuuuh come over here sexy boooi ‚Äú (in a gay and trying to be seductive voice). So that future, where the challenge doesn‚Äôt exist was pulled over to me. It was financial freedom. The future and I looked at each other. Gave us a bro handshake. Then hugged. Slowly our legs started to merge, becoming one and the more we merged, the faster the merging process became. As we finished merging, the gay guy threw me an hand air kiss and said ‚ÄûMy job here is dooooonhan (done)‚Äú and flew away. As the meditation came to a close, I suddenly I knew who the gay guy was. It was the fat gay guy from modern family (Cameron Tucker). And As I realized this, he appeared again saying ‚Äûguuuuuuiltyyy‚Äú and flew away again..

I was totally grinning, because I loved this visualization and I have to say ‚Äûthe unknown has a superb sense of humor. I love it.‚Äú and I kid you not. In the same second I wrote this sentence with the unknown having a superb sense of humor. Two stuff people came to. One was lighting at me with a flashlight and the other one said  
‚ÄûHow are you?‚Äú ‚Äûme: Good‚Äú  
‚ÄûDid you press the button for service? ‚Äûme: No I didn‚Äôt‚Äú  
‚ÄûBut the signal come from this seat‚Äú ‚Äûme: No I didn‚Äôt press the button‚Äú  
‚Äûokay okay no problem‚Äú.  
And I didn‚Äôt press the button. Not even accidentally. Both my hands were on fire writing this paragraph.

I also remember a regular squeak sound, which was happening for about a minute (so it was not someone changing positions in his seat, because it was a minute long and occuring on a fast regular time interval) and also, it happened exactly before I wrote the sentence about the humor. Like a charging up before the unknown or mystical experience happens. (That was the small mysctial experience).  
At 1809 I finished writing this paragraph. Pee pause, then next meditation.

**1819 - 1913: Meditation TINP + breath work from BOTEC 5 (9 mins)**  
Nothin special to report. As I was thinking about my first potential I imagined my bath tub filled with 50‚Ç¨ notes orbiting around my new potential and I was grinning really hard. My old self would have noch done that, because other people could see me doing that. My old self might have smiled a little bit.

**1915 - 1926: Meditation** [**guided gratitude meditaton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfD4HaBBc0I)  
I tried this gratitude mediation to see if I actually feel gratitude. Don‚Äôt know if it worked.

**1927 - 2135: Center of the Magnet (DOHA time)**  
I listened to the meditation at 1,5x speed (regular playtime: 2 std 40).  
It was okay. It is focusing on heart first and then on heart and brain coherence. During the breath it focuses on 2 things: 1. Drawing energy from the earth into your heart and then pulling energy from the cosmos into the heart. I will do this meditation this weekend again.

The plane landed at \~1940 (GERMAN time). Had to wait \~ 40 mins for my bag. I was at home at \~ 2230. I finished unpacking etc. and went to bed at 2335 and went to sleep.

\------------------------------------------------------  
**Further insights, which came to me during my flights and meditations**

* At some point Dr. Joe said ""What are you willing to give up to get what you want?
   * I rephrased it into: What are you willing to sacrifice like an offering, like a sacrifical pawn to the universe to get what you want?
* This made me think the following:
* Enough of partying, it is time to double down on this meditation stuff. You know, I am always do things in a radical way. There is no average way to do something for me. I am either in or I am out. I hate average.
* Quote from Grant Cardone
   * Imagine this advertisement:
   * Join us in our new average cinema. With average seats, with average sound quality and with an average sized movie screen. Our coca cola and other drinks taste purely average and our popcorn is made out of the most average ingredients to satisfy you to an average extent.
   * How much do you want to go to this cinema?
   * If not at all, why are you living your life in an average way?
* I decided to go into monk mode for at least until March, because the progressive retreat in Basel is at the end of February and if I immerse myself in meditation and Dr. Joe's teachings, I can be my most upgraded self at the retreat in Basel. Additionally, I can get on a consistent sleep schedule and wake up before work easily to meditate as well.
   * And even if nothing happens during these 2 months of full immersion into meditation, at least I rejuvenated my body.
* I set my alarm for 0400. This means I have to be sleeping at 2030 to get 7,5 hours of sleep. 1 sleep cycle is 90 minutes long, so it is always best to aim for a sleeping duration, which is a multiplication of 90 minutes.

**Todays's total meditation time: \~ 5 hours 42 mins (22.01.25)**  
\------------------------------------------------------  
**Fast, short and very effective NLP techniques**

* **Italian love**
   * See, hear or feel that negative thought/ picture / voice appear in your mind and give it some Italian love with a back hand slap.
   * Then see that negative thought cry, while holding its slapped cheek, run back into its room, close the door and staying in its room forever.
   * Which of your future negative thoughts would you like to give some Italian love?
* **Sexy Strobes or Catch & Choke (not sure which name is better haha)**
   * When a thought/ image/ sound occurs in your mind, grab it in your mind.
   * And if you like it rough, choke that f\*\*\*er like you would choke a BDSM fetishist.
   * Then shrink it down to the size of a penny and let it blink black and white extremely fast and say ""brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt"" (like machine gun fire) in your mind or out loud.
   * Finally, throw it way back into the distance, until it disappears completely and lights up like a shining star/ dot at the end of the universe. Like in Pokemon, where the bad guys get blown away into the distance.
   * Now, how much of your negative future shit can you catch & choke & let it blink black and white in the next minute?
* **Cultured Catch (same as Catch & Choke just less sexy and for prude people only) (I'm kidding)**
   * Grab that thought and throw it way into the distance
      * or hit that thought with a baseball bat from the get-go
   * and see it explode like fireworks on New Year's Eve and
   * know now that these fireworks are shining bright in celebration of you having already banished your old self from your current life
   * and your new self has already emerged and is already stabilizing in your new life right now.
   * PS: I'm not kidding.
* **Banana Boss**
   * I forgot the instructions, so I will write how this played out for me. This will be enough for you to visualize it yourself.
   * Picture a naggy boss/ wife/ husband or whomever is being naggy with you.
   * As the person gets naggy notice 8 mischievous monkeys jumping out of the next room or corner and coming into his direction.
      * One monkey jumps him at puts a banana in his mouth.
      * Two monkeys shove a chain, made out of bananas, over his head.
      * Three monkeys throw one banana each onto him and he begins to juggle them bananas.
      * One monkey strikes the ground with his whip ordering him to dance in a circle, while juggling the bananas.
      * One monkey jumps on one of your shoulders and touches you with his elbow like bro and say ""This a\*\*hole. Look how stupid he looks"" while laughing and pointing at him.
   * Now, how many monkeys do you need to order on amazon prime now to re-adjust how you see some people at your environments?
   * NEVER EVER tell the other person or anybody else that you did picture this. It might hurt the other persons feelings and it won't be good for your relationship.

Ah, the Minnesota Timberwolves versus the Denver Nuggets. It's like watching a classic David versus Goliath matchup, except David forgot his slingshot and Goliath is a 7-foot-tall Serbian named Nikola Jokiƒá.

The Nuggets are favored with odds around 1.52 to 1.59, depending on which bookmaker you trust to not ruin your weekend. Meanwhile, the Timberwolves are the underdogs, with odds ranging from 2.45 to 2.66. It's almost like the oddsmakers are daring you to bet on the Timberwolves, knowing full well that underdogs only win about 25% of the time in basketball. But hey, who doesn't love a good challenge, right?

The spread is set at -4.0 to -4.5 in favor of the Nuggets, which seems about right considering the Nuggets' ability to turn defense into offense faster than you can say ""altitude advantage."" The total points line is hovering around 228.5 to 229, suggesting a high-scoring affair. Or, as I like to call it, ""the game where defense takes a coffee break.""

Now, for my best bet: While the Timberwolves might surprise us with a spirited performance, the smart money is on the Nuggets to cover the spread. If you're feeling adventurous and have a penchant for underdog stories, you might sprinkle a little on the Timberwolves' moneyline. But remember, this isn't a Disney movie, and the Nuggets aren't about to let a plucky underdog steal their thunder.

So, grab your popcorn, place your bets, and enjoy the game. Just don't blame me if the Timberwolves pull off a miracle and you're left wondering why you didn't listen to that little voice in your head that said, ""Maybe today is the day for an underdog story.""",1,1737833053.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

1i9upge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1i9upge/why_are_students_so_concerned_about_prestige/,Why are students so concerned about prestige?,"Constantly there's this deluge of people complaining about the applications process to schools, lamenting that they will fail, working to the point of burnout over the hope to get into somewhere they consider to be ""the best"". But why?

What is this obsession with names and prestige? It's a level of elitism that people just endorse and accept outright. And it's simply misguided. The idea that a college is inherently worse, that the students are dumber, or that the degree is worth less because the name of the school isn't as famous is insane. 

No employer cares that a student went to MIT, or to Princeton, or to Yale if they don't have anything to show for it; that state school student who has worked on several national projects, has published while an undergrad, and who has been representing at conferences is going to have way more success than any bottom-class graduate of a supposed ""Top School"" because it simply doesn't matter that much. 

Selecting a college is supposed to be about finding a fit, about finding the place that offers the type of education you desire, in a place you would like to live, with a community of people you'd like to be a part of. But this obsession with rankings and ego not only ignores that fact, but actively inhibits otherwise great students from finding their own fit. Ask any interviewer for a ""top"" college and they'll have dozens of stories of times when a student couldn't articulate why they wanted to attend outside of some nebulous idea of being the ""best"" or being the ""highest ranked""; and these are students who could probably be perfectly happy somewhere else, and instead are having their hopes dashed after rejections pile in because they didn't do the due diligence of finding a good fit. 

In the world of academia, talk to any researcher, at any lab, in any place, and they'll tell you the same thing: that where your degree comes from doesn't really matter, it's only what you do with it afterwards. Some of the most successful scientists I have ever met were those who went to a supposed ""2nd rate"" school and then did real work with their degree. This is especially compounded when people become more specialized, where the focus of a given PhD is not only far more important than where it is done, but is the primary deciding factor. No student that wants to spend time researching deformation in exotic materials would give up their life's work thus far to go study additive manufacturing at MIT. 

And yet, with all this, students still are blinded by the allure of a name. They will work themselves half to death with an obsessive fervor all for the inevitably failing goal of a ""top school"". Not only does this hurt students, hurt education, and hurt major academic pursuits, but it's failing in nature.

Spent quite a few hours there and tasted a variety of different dishes. I'm rating them here so that people going tomorrow will have a heads up.

Tuscany Bakehouse - Pizza was served by slice. Good in taste with fresh ingredients. Focaccia sandwich was a let down as it was super dry and not worth 250.

Sigdi - Excellent dosas, crispy and flaky with great flavors.

Coconut crush drink was awesome.

CoffeeCafe's cold brew was nice in taste but bit watered down.

Indori Benjo and Hot dog was average in taste. Veg aloo patty was bland but omelette was good.

P se paratha had awesome dal paratha and tadka chaach. My personal recommedation!

Dakshin Vani was a let down as their menu was good but tasted terrible. The idlis felt like they were made of maida and sambhar was too thick and undercooked.

Kunafa was great, I had the coconut one and it tasted delicious with interplay of different textures.

Lamington served great desserts with chocolate strawberry being the topper.

Froyoland is great concept but on the pricier side. You can make weird combinations and prank your friends by making them taste it üòõ

F for fries, best fries in the city as always.

Malai chaap from veer ji was good. Not your average maide ka dhela dipped in sauces. 

Bhutte ka kees tasted like pohe if pohe were bad, sweet and served stingily as per price.

Chai from chai kaapi is good. I think its also the only place serving chai there. Under representation of chai in bhopal seen for the first time üòè

Ending with the baddest of the bad - Ramyun. They didn't open until 6 pm and then had the audacity to serve water mixed with chili oil as broth. The veggies were also steamed too much leading to mushy taste. So were the noodles, overcooked and so less in quantity it felt like I was drinking vegetable soup. Dumplings were also chewy and flavorless. It was a travesty!

That was everything that I had. Comment down below if you were there and share your experience as well.

I am simply here because I find myself texting my real life friends and siblings but rarely get the enthusiasm and attention I am seeking. I know everyone has their own life but I seem to always be there for them and whenever I am excited about something, they disappear.

(that's a long trauma filled dump that I'll only get into if anyone's interested) My biological parents have been divorced since before I was born and my mom doesn't know that I've been talking to my dad, but he and I have been talking every Sunday since Christmas. A week ago, I mentioned to him that I threw out my old coffee maker because I forgot about coffee and coffee grounds in both the top part and the pot, and both got filled with mold. Now, I thought I was just telling my Dad a funny story about my life, I was not expecting him to get me a coffee maker, especially since his wife controls his finances and she hates me for religious reasons (that's another part of the long trauma filled dump that I mentioned earlier). Anyway, I also mentioned the same thing to my mom a little bit later, and my mom sent me the exact coffee maker I wanted. A fancy Keurig that I can make single serve cups in. My dad sent me a regular coffee maker which at least has a clear glass coffee pot that I can see coffee in and I'm less likely to forget about cleaning, unlike my old one which had a metal coffee pot. On one hand, the coffee maker my dad got me is so far the only gift I've ever gotten from him, and that kinda makes it sentimental, but on the other hand the one my mom sent me is the exact coffee maker I wanted.

He was never a good man."" she shakes her head slightly, looking lost in thought as she speaks. ""It wasn't love that she was after, though. At first, of course she was hopeful for their marriage; but after their first year as a wedded couple, all she wanted was to get her share of the company assets and disappear. I was going to go with her.""

She pauses, taking a sip from her own cup. Grimacing at the taste, she gently pushes it away before continuing. ""But then he left her. With no warning. Just *poof-*"" she waves a hand through the air, ""-gone. Froze all of his accounts before she could take any of the money, changed the locks on the house they had bought, and had his lawyer serve her with the divorce papers the next day. Wouldn't even tell her why.""

I try to sort through the questions wracking my brain, finally landing on one. ""So, you want me to kill this guy because‚Ä¶?""

""Marilynn is still set to inherit everything if something happens to him. The divorce isn't finalized yet. She's been dodging his lawyers and refusing to sign the papers for the past two weeks, and we think she can keep it up for another month, give or take. Then she'll make a few demands just to make the process take longer, so nothing will be set in stone for another two months after that at the very least.""

I nod as though I understand. I don't, but I'm not about to tell her that. To me it sounds like a gold digger getting caught, and not wanting to reap what she sowed. I hardly think that's a valid enough reason to kill someone. She must see my thoughts written on my face because she leans forward, catching my eyes in a stare.

""She has worked for everything she was set to have. She started as a coffee bitch for the lowlife techies and busted her ass for years to move up in the company. She got her chair on the board of executives on her own, despite everyone thinking she slept her way to the top. That's what made Maxon notice her- her work ethic. It helps that she's beautiful,"" she says quietly, the jealousy apparent in her tone. ‚ÄúHe only got the company because his father died. He didn‚Äôt work for any of it. She deserves every cent of that money. And I want *you* to make sure she gets it.‚Äù She punctuates her words by pointing at me with a perfectly manicured finger.¬†

Well, when you put it like *that*‚Ä¶¬†

‚ÄúWhy do you need the money?‚Äù I ask, ‚ÄúIf you have 500 grand kicking around to pay me with, you can‚Äôt be that strapped for cash.‚Äù

She nearly rolls her eyes, as if the answer is obvious. She leans in, dropping her voice to a whisper. ‚ÄúMaxon Rysand has a net worth of 150 *billion* dollars.‚Äù

I choke on nothing, gasping and coughing, drawing the attention of a few regulars scattered around the restaurant. Loren sighs, her eyes flitting to the other customers and offering an apologetic smile on my behalf. I recover and force down another mouthful of coffee. Seriously, what do they put in it to make it taste like the inside of a shoe? I regain my ability to breathe, and level my eyes at her, conceding.

‚ÄúWhen will I get paid?‚Äù I feel like a junkie begging for a fix from their scummy dealer, but instead of being in a crackhouse in Belltown, we're sitting in a Mom and Pop diner at the ass crack of dawn. Also, this woman isn't a skeezy dealer that takes advantage of the druggies. She‚Äôs someone who truly believes that these ideals are true, and who am I to insert my 2 cents when there's many, *many* more cents to be had in this situation?¬†

‚ÄúIf you manage to get it done within two months, you will be paid 500,000¬† immediately upon alerting me that it has been done.‚Äù She responds curtly.

I nod. She underestimates my ability to exceed time restraints. ‚ÄúAnd if it‚Äôs within a month?‚Äù

She sets her jaw, eyeing me. She thinks I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing- that I'm out of my league. A sick part of me wants to kill the bastard within the next week just to prove my worth to her. Although, that might be my mommy issues talking.

‚ÄúIf you somehow complete your duties before two months have passed, then I will raise the price to one million.‚Äù I force myself to remain glued to the cheap vinyl booth seat so I don‚Äôt jump up and down with joy. A million dollars‚Ä¶ even though it means killing someone and I‚Äôll probably end up somewhere down under in the afterlife, at least I‚Äôll live out the rest of my sinful days in a mansion or some shit. I stretch my hand halfway across the table. ‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù

The corner of her mouth tilts up slightly in an evil half-smile as she takes my hand in hers and shakes it, sealing my fate. It‚Äôs an odd sight; my hand with bitten fingernails and cracked nail polish gripping her soft and finely manicured one. That just about sums up our differences, but our physical appearances may be where the differences end. Our similarities lie deeper. We both want one thing out of this situation- money. And as I pull my thick beanie lower on my head and steep out of the diner into the blistering cold, I decide one thing.

I am going to do *whatever it takes* to kill Maxon Rysand.

1i9uflk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i9uflk/one_glass_of_wine_and_almost_passing_out_from/,One glass of wine and almost passing out from vomiting and low blood pressure. But only sometimes.,"Hey y'all. This is a sensitive one as whenever I have approached any kind of medical professional I am treated like I have an alcohol overuse disorder. 

I (33f) have had the experience about 5-6 times in my life now where one glass of wine has made me so violently ill out of proportion to the alcohol content. I can drink wine most of the time with no issues. I drink quite little by my standards, every few weeks and from 1-3 drinks usually beer, but definitely have had wine without issue way more often than with issues.

Yesterday I had one glass of cheap house white wine with lunch with friends. About an hour later I started feeling dizzy, had a shower and vomitted everything up. Started feeling too dizzy to stand so sat in the shower for 20 minutes and nothing changed. I tried to get out and get my boyfriend and after about 5 steps I knew I was going to faint. My legs buckled and I dropped to the ground but was able to call out for help. My partner picked me up to take me to bed and I was able to help with the first few steps but my legs stopped kind of working I just felt like a ragdoll. My eyes were flickering closed. When he got me to bed he called a medical help line and my dad came to my room and took my blood pressure with his at home reader which was 90/48. 

The medical help line just said they wanted to send an ambulance with no advice but this isn't the first time I've had this kind of thing and I've gone to hospital before just to feel better pretty quickly and have them tell me to cut down on my booze. So I stayed home. 

I vomitted again, and during this my BP when up to 128/67 but as soon as I stopped being sick it was down to 91/50. I laid in bed slowly eating electrolyte icy poles for the next hour. Started feeling better and two hours later my BP was back to normal, I ate a bowl of soup and felt completely fine. 

What is happening? Why is it only wine that does this not other alcohols? And why only sometimes? I've drunk wine on other occasions with no issues.

When I have been hospitalised previously it's only even been to get my fluids up and the nausea down. They kept me overnight once because in conjunction to the low blood pressure my heart rate dropped to around 45bpm for a few hours. Once they said it was acute gastritis and I do show some signs of having mild chronic gastritis. Could that be the reason? But why would my blood pressure drop to the point of standing making me faint?

I'm obviously going to stop drinking wine but I'd still like to know. I have had a very similar previous episode triggered after no food, black coffee, then a 8 hour flight with an airline meal.",1,1737832275.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1i9ue3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i9ue3e/budget_friendly_tips/,Budget friendly tips,"Hey everyone,

I have seen a decent amount of posts lately about beginner friendly tips and budgeting for your espresso set ups, especially for college students. I am the queen of good finds and pride myself on a good deal, so I thought it might be helpful to share some of my tips. First, I am a college student (code for broke) who is realistic about what I should be spending my money on. Additionally, my future career as a teacher will probably not allow me to be buying what I really want for my set up, so I have settled into the budget friendly lifestyle. I have spent about $171 dollars over the past year on espresso equipment (it isn't impressive equipment, but it does the job). I am a novice, but a lot of people are, so I hope this reaches the right audience. For those who are interested, **a cost breakdown on my equipment:**

**1. Flair Neo Flex manual press**\- 100 USD (there are sales where I bought mine for 79 on amazon; keep an eye out!). This is a great way to brew quality espresso on a budget! One important thing about the Neo Flex- you need good quality grinded beans. I talk about this later in the post, but you can invest money in a good grinder, I've been saving up for about a month now on mine.

**2. Kettle** (not pictured). I bought my kettle at goodwill for 4-5 dollars. It is steel, heats up my water, and works just fine.

**3. Milk steaming**. As you see to the right of the first picture, there is an eyesore green espresso machine. I first bought this over a year ago for 40 USD when I started my journey and quickly realized that it doesn't brew great espresso (although i do get crema so maybe a win?). I keep it around to steam my milk because I am broke and saving up for a quality grinder and steamer/frother. Great option if you got stuck like me and like milk-based espresso drinks at times!

**4. Beans and Syrup.** My beans come from local coffee shops and are the only thing I actually dont budget my money on. I spent 25 dollars on the pound of beans to the right in the brown bag (I think? It might have been cheaper; I bought them a long time ago). There are plenty of affordable options though! Starbucks espresso beans are available at most grocery stores and honestly make good espresso when grinded correctly. My syrup is Monin and cheaper syrups (not pictured and can't remember the brands). I'll explain how I save money on these in a minute.

**Budget Friendly Tips!**

**1. Goodwill, goodwill, goodwill.** I love goodwill, and think it always has great options for appliances. I found a Mr. coffee espresso machine there one time, gifted it to a friend who is a beginner as well, and it works perfectly. Spent like 10 bucks on it too. Probably my best find there. Pictured is my cute lil espresso cups and the big green cups that I love. Bought them for 2 bucks at goodwill in a bag with other kitchen supplies (and the glass jars in the back) and they are amazing. Go to a sort of rich area, find the closest goodwill, and I promise you that you will find something.

**2. TJ Maxx will be a lifesaver.** If you are like me and love a quality syrup but don't want to break the bank, TJ Maxx is the best place to go. Monin syrups typically go for 11-25 dollars and tbh I don't want to spend that type of money on syrup. TJ Maxx posts them at 6.5-8 bucks! Also their other syrups are even cheaper and a great buy. Also pictured are my syrup dispensers, which are at TJ Maxx for 10 bucks for two of them. I bought the other two at goodwill (3 bucks ;) ).

**3. Facebook marketplace.** I am constantly stalking FB marketplace and the number of good deals I find on there for espresso set ups is unreal. People tend to just buy good machines like a Breville, never use it, then sell it for a severely discounted price. Obviously be conscious on who you are buying from and really check out the machine or appliances before buying, but this is a great budget friendly option. Tamper sets are being sold there all the time, check it out! (Also low ball them, it works most of the time).

**4. The perfect grinder**. This may be niche advice and is probably my most inconvenient option, but I just go to my local Fresh Market (whole foods type of store) and use their hella expensive coffee grinder. This is temporary as I am saving up for a good grinder at the moment, but I have had such good espresso and haven't spent a dime on grinding it. If you can't bring your own beans, buy theirs and use their grinder (typically these types of stores have good beans). I know this is weird advice, but it works for me, and I hope it gives you an option.

**5. Save up gift cards.** If you are in a good situation where your friends and family give you gifts for holidays, ask for gift cards and use them on espresso appliances and products. Espresso stuff is expensive, but if you save up gift cards or maybe gift money, it can really help ease the purchasing pain when buying an expensive grinder. I only say this because this is a method my friend uses and if it is an option for you, totally do it.

I am sorry for the length of this post, but I am a yapper and love to give advice. If anyone has any other tips or critiques on my suggestions, please comment! **Just because you are low income or balling on a budget doesn't mean you don't deserve good espresso.** I hope this helped!",2,1737832167.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

I constantly second guess everything I want to say, or write, in order not to say something completely foolish or screw up basic grammar, even when it's a question of common sense

Sometimes I simply can't follow the conversations going on around me, or understand them only after a while

I don't know how to react to others most of the time so I just end up doing or saying something awkward

Most of the time I simply forget words so I keep trying to explain my reasoning and thoughts in the most basic manner

Even then I find myself often not finishing my sentences, forgetting my point, not even having a point or an opinion, even when it's important for me to have one, like at my job meetings

I constantly catch myself thinking more about how I'm saying something and how everyone in the room is watching me closely more than what I'm supposed to be talking about

I'm really asocial at work and coup myself up in my office all day, only going out on my breaks to get coffee and use the toilet, and I constantly feel like my colleagues think I'm avoiding them or hate them or something, even though I just can't integrate myself into their conversations

I wish that I was just normal, but instead I feel like my mind is always empty, like I only choose to have an opinion on a few subjects of discussion and the rest I just don't even care to think about, and end up always blanking out.

Any advice?

This is a long one, but I think the context is important.

Fianc√© (I'll call him J) and I have been together for three years, living together for two and a half, and we were friends for about a year before becoming a couple. Things were amazing in the beginning - he was attentive and affectionate, and showed me every day that I was important to him. He even wrote me a poem about how much I mean to him. I couldn't imagine being happier. From the start he was an equal partner, handling all the cooking and half of the housekeeping. I have a child from a previous relationship who lives with us (bio dad is barely involved and lives in another state) and J has stepped up to become an amazing dad. I never pushed their relationship, it happened very naturally and they clearly adore each other.

After about a year together, we decided try moving to a different area. When we got there I found it easy to get a job (I have a BA, he has gone to college but didn't finish, so on paper he only has HS) and the stress of being a sahd and not being a ""provider"" for his family got to him. I always reassured him that his work at home was just as valuable as mine, and that I didn't mind that it was taking him longer to find a paying job. Not only did it not help, him feel better, he said I was invalidating his feelings. He did eventually find work, but the entire year in that state was stressful for so many reasons, and our relationship became strained. When our lease was up we moved back to where we came from.

When we got back I immediately started working, and again it took him a few months to find something (which again caused him immense stress), but he eventually did and has worked consistently since then. I also have a commission-based job that I schedule myself, but it takes at least a couple hours weeknights and weekends. His relationship with our child is just as good, but ours is still struggling. He still cooks and helps with our child, but does basically no housework or family management. I do all the logistical stuff - paying bills and tracking money, making and keeping appointments, keeping track of the shopping list, keeping track of our child's activities, and pretty much everything else you can think of to keep a home running. He doesn't even pick up after himself anymore - every day there are dirty socks and tissues all over the ground, and food mess on the counter and stove that I didn't leave there but I become responsible for cleaning. Lately he's even letting the cooking slide - we have dinner together a few nights a week, and the rest of the time he cooks something quick for himself and our child, and I do my own thing.  Our s3x life has suffered considerably because I'm stressed and tired. I know that's something that's very important to him (honestly me too, but I'm drowning so it's not the first thing on my mind anymore) so I might be an AH for not just getting over myself and doing it.

I admit, I'm needy. I want non-s3xual affection and sweetness daily. He tells me he loves me every day, but it would mean so much to hear WHY. Like what he loves about me, happy memories he has of us, things he'd like to do in the future. I want to feel like he's attracted to me, and not just that he wants s#x. I'd like a little romance, you know? Not all the time, but a little trickle every day. Instead I mostly get playful roughhousing and insults, and smacks on the @ ss.  When we do have s3x the focus is on meeting his needs and mine are usually forgotten. When we talk it's often him talking at me about a game or some history topic, neither of which are interesting to me at all, but I try to pay attention and ask questions. I don't bring up anything but our mutual interests anymore, because in the past when I wanted to talk about something I'm into, he wouldn't even look up from his phone and immediately forgot everything I said.

2024 was especially hard for me. J is really into board games, and his best game buddy lives two doors down. He's often over there on a weeknight for 4-6 hours, and weekends for that much or longer. In 2024 he forgot our anniversary and my birthday because he was gaming those days. Last winter I feel on the icy sidewalk and cut my face badly while he was over at his buddy's playing board games. I sent him a frantic SOS and he did come home to help me find my spare glasses, but after a few minutes he went back over to play, leaving me to deal with the injury. For Christmas I filled his stocking and bought him tickets to something he has always wanted to do, while he went shopping on Christmas Eve for whatever was available. He got me a few random things that are close to what I like but not quite, and a gag gift. Throughout the year if I see something I like, I point it out, and I'm not high maintenance - it's usually something like a simple necklace or a set of PJs. During arguments he has called me delusional, told me I make bad decisions, and heavily implied that I only cry to manipulate him. He's also accused me of gaslighting him because we remember things differently - I don't think I am, I think we just have different perspectives, but maybe I am and I just don't see it.

On top of this, he's very upset about my relationship with his family. He has a large extended family that lives nearby. I like them all fine and attend all the family events. Sometimes I moan and say I don't want to go, but so does he, and when it comes time to drive over I go without further complaint. It's not even that I don't want to see them, which I've made clear to him, I just prefer hanging out at home most of the time. When I do spend time with them, we get along, but we haven't really connected on a deep level. I like them but I don't love them, and I can't make love grow by willpower. He says ""I want you to be part of my family"" and acts like I'm intentionally rejecting them, which couldn't be further from the truth. I have no family of my own so I would be so happy if I integrated into his and we all loved each other, but it just isn't that way.

Another factor is that he works in a female-dominated field, so he has female friends from work. I don't mind that in theory, but he's often texting with them at home while I'm sitting on the other end of the couch watching reels and feeling ignored. He talks about them all the time, and if one of them texts while we're talking he'll cut me off to text them back.

We were supposed to get married last fall, but postponed due to finances (which are better now). He hasn't talked about setting a new date since then. I brought up needing a vacation recently, and he said we should go somewhere tropical - that was our honeymoon plan originally, but I guess now it's just a vacation. The other day I mentioned maybe just having a courthouse wedding, or something very small outside the courthouse, and just having a simple backyard reception for his family. He seemed really upset, and never gave me an answer. I somewhat understand because I've been married before so the wedding isn't as big a deal to me, while this is his first marriage. I'd rather use the money for a nice honeymoon, while he wants the wedding experience. But I couldn't help but feel on some level like the wedding is more important to him than being married to me. Maybe he feels like I'm trying to cut his family out because he thinks I don't want to be part of them?

Today he's at his buddy's place again, having game day. They're playing noon to 4ish, while I stay home and clean the house. We were supposed to spend the day together, especially because he had to work last weekend, but when his buddy texted him this morning about gaming, he dropped our plans in an instant. I feel lonely, isolated, frustrated, and unloved right now. I have one good friend who I have spent one day with in the year+ since we moved back, and no hobbies. I'm too stressed and tired to visit my friend or engage in hobbies most of the time. He tells me I've also stopped doing the small things that make him feel loved, and he's right, I need to be better about that.

To be fair there's a lot to love about him. He's an amazing cook and an even better dad. He He works hard to support us. He does all the driving because I don't like to and carries all the heavy stuff. He brings me coffee when we're home together in the morning. He takes our child to her appointments and activities at least half the time. He supports my evening/weekend job, which I'm trying to work into being my full time career so I can quit my 9-5. He encourages me in my hobbies (though as I said, I don't really have the energy for them right now). There's also a lot about me that isn't great. I can be moody and depressed, I'm not super enthusiastic lately about leaving the house to try new things together, I get cranky at times, I clam up about my feelings (I don't speak up much because I'm a crier when talking about feelings, and it really bothers him), and  I can get really frustrated and snappy about the housework and such at times. I've also said some awful things to him during arguments, and I haven't found a way to apologize that is meaningful to him.

I love this man, but idk what to do anymore. I know he loves me and he mean well. I know he's not cheating. I understand how important his family is to him. I appreciate him so much for raising a child who isn't his biologically with complete love and acceptance. I appreciate his hard work to provide for us, and his willingness to take over the cooking. I adore his sense of humor, his adventurous spirit, his nerdiness, his intelligence, and so much more. I love how he runs to the door to greet me when I get home from work, and the kiss he gives me every night when we go to bed. I can't imagine my life without him in it. I wonder if he even cares whether I'm in his life, or if I'm interchangeable with any other partner who would provide s#x and home management services.

How do I move past this? I don't know how to be playful and fun, the way he needs me to be in order to connect with me. I can't drop either of my jobs right now, and I can't drop the housework and such because there's no one to pick it up, and I have a child to consider. I want so much for him to prioritize me and really love me again, and I want him to feel loved in return. What can I do to help us reconnect?",0,1737831985.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

*‚ÄúAbout a minute after I exhaled, I had the feeling of being surrounded by large invisible things studying me.‚Äù* 

This is from part of a report by a user of *bufo*, slang for the 5-HO-DMT, which is found in the toxin cocktail of the Colorado River Toad. Huffing the secretions of terrified amphibians is just one of the many ways man has sought to achieve an altered state of consciousness. However, hallucinogenic compounds are not often produced in the animal kingdom. So besides smoking toads, there are few known psychedelic animals.  
  
Before diving into the others, let's give the river toad its due. Also called the Sonoran Desert Toad, the Colorado River Toad is native to a relatively small swath of North America, with a habitat spanning from the deserts of Arizona to the grasslands of Mexico. It lives most of its life underground in a protective mucus burrow to escape the heat of the day. Depending on the area and season, the toads can stay underground in hibernation until the sound of rain awakens them. From there, it is a mad scramble to eat, mate and suck up as much water as possible before the sun drives them back underground.

During this time, they are easy prey for toad milkers. The underground market for *bufo*, illegal in all 50 US states, has been booming since the release of a pamphlet back in 1983. *BUFO ALVARIUS: THE PSYCHEDELIC TOAD OF THE SONORAN DESERT*, written and published by Ken Nelson, writing as Albert Most, hit the psychedelic scene of the 80s harder than a civil rights protestor getting thrown to the pavement.¬†

Ken had uncovered that *Incilius Alvarius* (*Bufo Alvarius*) was one of few fauna to produce 5-HO-DMT, so he went down to the banks of the Colorado and caught a fat toad. He then proceeded to harass the poor thing until it felt threatened enough to shoot out a jet of milky white toxin from glands behind its fearful eyes. Ken dried the slime overnight and then smoked it. His trip was transcendent; he would go on to say it was one of the most profound experiences of his life.   
  
From that point on, he dedicated his life to spreading awareness of the drug's healing potential and advocating for the conservation of the special creature. That last bit of his message has largely gone unheeded, as the river toad population has declined steadily over the years. This is partly due to pollution and human expansion into its already small habitat, but also from the black market, where the animal‚Äôs milky juice can fetch a high price. To understand what could draw people to smoke the dried, poisonous tears of a toad, we must look at just what DMT does to the user.¬†

Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), also called the ‚Äú*Spirit Molecule*,‚Äù is a powerful psychedelic that humans have used for centuries. It also may be naturally produced by our brains to aid in dreaming. It has been found in both brain tissue and cerebral fluid, and many speculate that it plays a significant role in near-death experiences.   
  


¬†¬†¬†*‚ÄúI'm still tripping even though I am back in the room. I can hear conversations now (but it sounds foreign), and a wash of euphoria engulfs me. All I can do is smile. I felt like nothing but part of everything. This was happiness I had never experienced before, to be truly connected and accepted.‚Äù*



One of the hallmarks of a DMT trip‚Äîwell, a positive one‚Äîis the euphoria accompanying the comedown. This sense of joy and overall well being can last from a few days to months after a single dose. Dosage is vital as DMT requires a certain threshold before a ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù can occur, and a person‚Äôs mental state enters fully into the hallucination.   
  
Many report it is here that they experience communication with entities that exist on the other side of our awareness. They are often shown visions that attempt to convey feelings of joy and acceptance or impart some much-needed knowledge. Whatever messages and finer details of the trip are often forgotten after they come down, the same way a dream fades from the waking mind. Wild fractals and strange geometry make up this space; users feel outside their bodies but can still move through the hallucination. The 5-HO-DMT produced by the toad is a variant that many claim provides extended visuals.

  
*Sarpa salpa,* also known as the salema porgy, has been used for its hallucinogenic properties as far back as ancient Greece. Called the *dream fish,* eating this fish has caused extremely pronounced hallucinations that can last for several days. Despite its ancient use, there are few reports, partly due to the negative effects that have prevented it from gaining recreational popularity. The dream this fish gives you is, more often than not, a nightmare. One man who accidentally ate the fish at a local restaurant descended into a three-day hellscape‚Äîpopulated with screaming human faces everywhere and towering crab-like creatures that blotted out the sun.

Its mind-altering properties are complex, and many speculate it is due to the creature's diet of kelps and other sea plants that contain a cocktail of toxins and alkaloids. Once ingested by the fish, these compounds cause *Ichthyoallyeinotoxism*, or hallucinogenic fish inebriation, when that fish goes on to be eaten by some unsuspecting tourist. The experience is so profound that the person will completely believe what they see is real, the hallmark of a deliriant.¬†¬†

Deliriants are different from hallucinogens in a number of ways. Chief among these is the experience itself. While on a DMT trip, the person is aware that they are hallucinating. They know that their reality is altered, and experienced psychonauts (people who explore altered states of consciousness) can use that to help manage if a trip turns bad.¬†

To someone under the effects of a deliriant, there is no difference between the seven-foot cockroach eating spaghetti at your table and the barista who serves you coffee. The hallucination becomes your reality. While reports of experiences on the dream fish are few, deliriant reports are numerous and horrifying‚Äîanother difference between them and other hallucinogens, such as LSD.

*Datura stramonium*, known as *Jimson weed* in some areas and *devil‚Äôs trumpet* in others, is a flowering nightshade found worldwide. Some grow the plant for its large, drooping flowers, and it can be found in many gardens and roadsides. It is also a well-known and powerful psychedelic thanks to a potent mix of the deliriants Atropine and Scopolamine, which it contains in deadly levels. That is the thing with using datura; every part of the plant is poisonous because there is no way to know the amount of alkaloids it contains. Something as small as four or five seeds could contain enough chemicals to kill a user.¬†

A death that would come after hours of hellish dry mouth from dehydration, painful chest constriction, and delusions so maddening that many suffer a psychotic break and fly into violent outbursts before finally succumbing to the paralysis of their smooth muscle system. A truly horrible way to go.¬†

  
While smoking toad squeezins and eating enough fish heads to see Poseidon doesn‚Äôt sound appealing to many, they are a bit more appetizing than going through the ‚Äúant ordeal‚Äù of the Luiseno tribe of California. Members of the tribe would go on a three-day fast, with no food and little to no water, before eating large balls of feathers. These little balls would contain a handful of red harvester ants, and the men would consume dozens.¬†

The ants would then begin to bite and sting them from the inside. Once the men became catatonic from the painful stings, starvation, and dehydration, they would be granted visions from the spirit world. None of the chemicals found in the sting of the red harvester ant have been shown to have any hallucinogenic properties.¬† ¬† ¬†   
  
It would seem that in the end, there is very little man won‚Äôt do to have a damn good time.¬†

  
*(Set and setting are essential for any attempt with psychoactive substances, as are dosage and potency. This is in no way an endorsement to use an illegal substance; it is more of a plea to be smart and responsible. We only get one trip around this rock.)*

I am LC with my mom and NC with my niece for the past five years. Five years ago my niece engaged in some serious antisocial behavior directed at us and we‚Äôve not been able to have a relationship since and now I no longer want one. The situation with my niece has been particularly traumatic and it‚Äôs only been in the last year where things have gotten back to some kind of normal. I‚Äôve been to therapy and have done a lot of work on myself 

Relevant to my post, years ago my niece also stole several thousand from my mom and at some point they also went NC. 

So this morning I‚Äôm sitting here drinking coffee and minding my own business when I receive an email with screenshots from my mom stating that my niece contacted her after four years or so of nothing. Except the screenshot only shows one message in a DM from my niece. The tone of the message is my niece‚Äôs normal mean and extremely aggressive but it‚Äôs worded in such a way that there HAD to have been other, recent contact prior to. My mom insists there wasn‚Äôt but I don‚Äôt believe her. My niece is a completely unreasonable person but there‚Äôs no getting around the fact the one solo message wasn‚Äôt their first interaction. Normally I would not care about someone else‚Äôs conversation but my niece has been an unsafe person and it‚Äôs clear there‚Äôs something off with my mom‚Äôs email.

The way I‚Äôve never felt bored in his presence. We didn‚Äôt need things to fill the void or distract us. We could speak on anything and it was always enriching and fulfilling. We were both curious and shared a mutual desire to learn and grow. 

The way he showed me his love. Through thoughtful gifts, gestures, planning trips, coffee in the morning. He made me feel treasured and prioritized, at least when we were together. 

The way he made me feel brave. He introduced me to many things I wouldn‚Äôt have tried without him. He made me feel comfortable and assured that it would be okay. I wanted more of that. I don‚Äôt know if I can be as brave without him. 

The way he shared my values. We both deeply care about politics, conservation, human rights, the environment, the state of the world for future generations. To be matched to fundamentally was really profound and special. I doubt anyone else will care as much as you and I did together. 

The way his face lit up when he would see me for the first time after being apart. That look alone told me how much he loved me. It was written all over his face. I have many pictures and videos that capture the essence and i don‚Äôt know what to do with it all. 

The way he was patient. It helped me improve because he did it quite well. He let me take the time I needed to say what I needed. I didn‚Äôt do the best at reciprocating, but it was an improvement overall. 

The way he cared for others. It was so healing to watch him love people around him. It was such a joy to witness and I felt proud to be his partner. 

The way he showed me unconditional love. The way he came back countless times, even though I know it hurt his ego to do so. The way he wanted to make it work beyond what was sensible anymore, because he loved me so greatly. I‚Äôve never had anyone in my entire life love me that sincerely, and maybe I never will again.

Looking to transform your living room with the perfect lighting?  can make a huge difference, setting the mood and enhancing your space‚Äôs overall aesthetic.

From sleek, minimalist designs to bold statement pieces, [modern lighting](https://www.bestosmosisexperts.com/modern-living-room-lighting-ideas/) offers countless options to suit every style.

Consider pendant lighting for an elegant and functional addition above your coffee table or dining area. Or, opt for track lighting to create focused illumination, ideal for highlighting artwork or architectural features.

Smart bulbs are a game-changer, allowing you to adjust the brightness and color to match any occasion. Don‚Äôt forget about floor and table lamps, which not only provide additional light but also add a stylish touch to your decor.

Layering different types of lighting‚Äîambient, task, and accent‚Äîcan help create a balanced and welcoming atmosphere in your living room. It‚Äôs all about mixing textures and finishes to complement your existing furniture and decor.

I drove across the mountains today, from Stavanger to Oslo here in Norway. The route consists of lots of fairly windy country roads, with clear sight lines, the type that is too narrow to have any central road markings but you can see for miles. To add to the fun there was a mix of snow, slush, visible ice and black ice along a lot of the road.

So, I drove as I always drive in such conditions. Straightening out the corners, keeping a bit of margin towards the edges of the road in case it was more slippery than anticipated. All the cars safety systems were turned off, yet the car kept pinging at me....

Ignored them, although it is pretty annoying to have something flashing and pinging in the car while driving in conditions that require some concentration.

At around 80 kph the car suddenly decides it has had enough of me driving across the centerline of the road and yanks me back towards the right. On ice. In a bend. Cheers KIA. If I was anything less than awake before that I was certainly 110% after that code brown moment.

I truly cannot stand these bloody safety systems, and especially that ""sleepyness"" algorithm that uses lane positioning to determine if you are tired or not.

If I have CFS (which I think I do), this is mild case, and my main problem is post-exertional malaise. I also have occasional POTS. The main thing that ever helped me with backround tiredness was Ivabradine. When doctor finally prescribed it for my tachycardia, after 12 years of having it, everyone around noticed increase in my energy. I was also diagnosed with ADHD and tried Adderall for it. What I noticed, is that when I took it, it gave me energy and motivation to do things. But I don't want to deal with controlled substance, especially because it ruined my progress with Ivabradine.

What's also interesting, is that I don't have other symptoms other than this malaise, i.e. no light/sound sensitivity, and my condition has nothing to do with COVID. I don't have throat pain after zinc/D supplementation courses, and gladly I never had joint pain. What did nothing to me in terms of energy: iron infusions, vitamin D level increase, typically vitamin B12 increase. Sometimes I feel drop in energy and I used to take Vitamin B complex, and it helped a couple of times.

Would you help answering few questions for a fellow sufferer?

1. Are there any other diagnoses that can explain post-exertional malaise? The one where you are totally exhausted and the exhaustion starts 1 day after exercises. Meanwhile, right after exercise, it's fine. It appears after sleep in the morning.
2. Did ivabradine or similar POTS medication helped anyone with CFS?
3. Did Adderall help anyone with CFS in terms of energy?
4. Do you notice difference in taking vitamin B-supplements? And how often do you take them?
5. Does coffee actually help your CFS (meaning is it even worse without it?)?",2,1737830586.0,cfs,0,1.0,False

Hey, I‚Äôm in my early thirties and haven‚Äôt had a best friend or friends since my twenties. In elementary school I used to spend the breaks sitting on a bench alone or trying to make friends with peers - which didn‚Äôt work out. Then in my teens I connected with people over my special interest in a certain music genre but it kind of remained superficial. 

The few friends I had from school ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù with me because I didn‚Äôt text or call often. Always felt different. Is that an autism thing? If so how can I make and most importantly keep friendships? 

I think I don‚Äôt really UNDERSTAND friendships. I don‚Äôt just want to hang out - I rather prefer alone time and keeping busy with my special interests. I want to be UNDERSTOOD and be able to trust (and vice versa ofc) - deep connections over superficial coffee dates. When do you consider someone a friend?

I have a pretty stereotypical competitive cyclist complexion: lean/jacked legs and skinny upper body with some muscle.

Tbh, it looks kinda weird in the mirror. Recently after going to the gym on and off for 3 years, mostly during winter, to build some leg muscle and train cardio on the bike for the upcoming mtb summer season, I finally decided to take it seriously.

I generally spend around 2 hours in the gym (occasionally 3 if I'm really in the mood for some cardio). And it's mostly composed of an hour of working out upper body 3x10-15 reps for each:

Dumbell:
+ Seated shoulder press;
+ Contraction curls;
+ Dumbell tricep kickbacks

Cable (not always available cause it's a one big machine always in high demand):
+ Cable chest press;
+ Lat pulldown;
+ Seated cable row;
+ Cable tricep rope

Barbell:
+ Inclined bench press (15¬∞) with 90 lbs;
+ Bar curls

Other:
+ Dips;
+ Abs crunches (40 all at once);
+ Pull-ups (12-15 all at once)

Followed by an hour of INTENSIVE cardio on the bike emulating either my 3-4 hour Alpine climbs or a last mile sprint. This is pretty much my leg workout as I don't have dedicated leg day exercises, and I don't need them either.

Any advice on how to train the upper body muscles to get them to match my leg muscles without sacrificing cardio performance or losing leg muscle mass? I've heard doing strength training and cardio the same day is gonna cancel out the strength training but I can't realistically go to gym any more than 3 times a week cause in the evenings the varsity gym is so crowded that you won't find a spare machine, but still need to bike either way, hence I combine the two.

Ps: I've never used preworkout, even for cycling, cause I'm on the fence about their health risks, tho my old roommate, who was a high-performance cyclist, was drinking it every morning. I don't even drink coffee tbh. My goal is not to bulk. My goal is to get lean. But I feel like my biggest problem is under-eating as I eat maybe 1-2 times a day and then just snack (no junk food or anything).

1i9tqbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1i9tqbk/being_parentied_has_really_fucked_me_badly/,Being parentied has really fucked me badly,"All my life, I thought the problem was my mom, a textbook narcissist who abused me and neglected me both physically and emotionally. My dad was the ""safe parent"", the only person I had an emotional bond with. However, I've come to realised that, for all he loved me and tried his best with me, he also parentified me. You see, my mom cheated on my dad and left him when I was only 4; my dad was understanbly depressed about it and he would always confide and vent to me that he felt lonely and missed my mom. He would also say ""please, tell mom that I miss her, and that she can come back anytime and I'll welcome her back with open arms"".

So as a child I felt the responsibility not only to make my father happy, but also to try to convince my mom to get back with him. My father is a shy man, just like me, he struggles to connect with people and he's always been lonely. He didn't really have friends or hobbies and he spent all his time with me, when he wasn't working. I saw him so sad and depressed and felt sorry for him. I loved my dad and I just wanted to make him happy. Which isn't bad in itself, but I felt a huge weight on my shoulder, as if my dad's happiness depended on me and he desperately needed me, much more than I NEEDED HIM.

In a way, I felt like I was the parent in our relationship.

As a result, as you can probably guess, I turned out to have a huge savior/hero/fixer complex, which has fucked up my life much more than you can imagine. I'm only attracted to mentally fucked up, emotionally weak and dependent people, who have major issues (much worse than me). ALL of my boyfriends/love interests were alcoholics, drug addicts, and has serious mental health disorders; many of them were low-functioning and needed a lot of support and care. My most recent ex, who I've just broken up with, has never worked a day in his life, still lived with his mom at 33 before he met me, couldn't DO SHIT ON his own, anything around the house, not even make a coffee (I'm not kidding). He was completely dependent on me, both emotionally and for his basic needs; he was too scared to go out alone and didn't even go to the supermarket without me.

And the thing is... as much as I'm aware of how crazy it sounds, I ENJOYED taking care of someone so helpless and dependent as him; I wouldn't have had any other way.

Is there anyone else as extreme as me? Can you even heal from something like this? My conscious mind knows this is not how relationships are supposed to me and I always end up feeling burned out. I'm feeling so overwhelmed right now, I honestly would have never thought that a father simply telling his child about his problem would have resulted in something like this.",2,1737830475.0,CPTSD,1,0.75,False

But I had no idea she needed any of that and says I need to be assumptive of her needs while she framed this as a casual yoga event. I was also thrown off since i didn‚Äôt start the class until 11:45 and she had to be there earlier so the ask of just getting there before 10 seemed like that already allotted for the prep time she‚Äôd need beforehand.

We get there at 9:50 and she is still crying and asking ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you just think‚Äù and I tell her that I really had no idea of the additional requirements and really have no idea what to say because I got us there before 10.

All I could say is we‚Äôre going in a loop and wasting time since the conversation/argument goes in the same direction and we should focus on being here and moving on for now so we could get her yoga done and revisit it after she‚Äôs done.

I started feeling like an asshole when she wanted my support to get her back in the groove but would also ask why I was the victim and I told her that I really don‚Äôt feel like I did anything wrong since she never specified that this was a critical class and never mentioned that she wanted to be extra early since she had the chance to let me know the night before and right before my walk to give me proper times and expectations.

How might you react to this?

1. Fret non-stop about the stain. Think about it constantly, simply stare at it all day. Priortize looking at over much of your life
2. Calmly acknowledge there‚Äôs a stain, note what fears it maybe covering up (fear of looking slopy, or unprofessional, whatever), take it off your body, and replace it with a different garment or the same after a nice wash. How do you feel now? Clean and ready!

Sharing this thought exercise because they use an analogue one in the hemi-synch exercises from the Monroe Institute. The idea is to shut down the left side of your brain, usually through the use of music at certain beats and affirmations, so the right side intuitive part of you can recognize the real source of your worries and you can focus your energies productively.¬†

The general idea of thoughts or emotions as being garments through which we interact with the material world is also found in many diverse spiritual teachings and something to keep in mind generally!

1i9tgcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i9tgcw/an_08_honda_civic_door_ruined_my_life/,An 08 Honda Civic door ruined my life...,"I know, I know, it‚Äôs a strange combination of words that makes me sound crazy‚Äîno, more than crazy‚Äîlike a lunatic, and right now you‚Äôre probably asking yourself how that‚Äôs even possible; but I promise you that I will try, to the best of my abilities, to explain how an eighth gen Civic door that I purchased from a scrapyard nearly made a divorcee of me, almost brought my life to a premature conclusion, and gave me a severe case of PTSD which plagues me to this day...

The story starts three years ago in a bungalow on the outskirts of Minneapolis during the height of the Covid pandemic, with me and my wife going through some harsh economic times. My wife had been laid off from her job, and I was working from the house remotely. During this time we never once left the home except to walk our five-year old Toy Poodle Luna around the yard to do her business, and everything was ordered in. We needed a replacement rear passenger side door for the old summer vehicle, a red, eighth gen Honda Civic, because ours was all rusted through. Looking to save a buck, I did what any other sane person would do‚ÄîI called the local wrecking yard.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I asked the first person to pick up, ‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt happen to have a rear passenger side door for an 08 Honda Civic on hand, would you?‚Äù

""What color are you looking for?‚Äù the salesman asked gruffly.

‚ÄúRed,‚Äù I responded politely.

‚ÄúLet me check here on my computer for you‚Ä¶‚Äù Some thirty seconds went by before he said:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in luck. A red 08 Honda Civic just came in the other week from the impact auction with that door in mint condition. We‚Äôre asking two hundred for it.‚Äù

After haggling for a bit with the salesman on the price, he informed me that there u-pick yard was closed because of Covid, and that they would have to deliver the part to my doorstep. I gave the salesman my address, and the part was speedily delivered to my doorstep the very next day, much faster than I could‚Äôve ever anticipated. I was extremely satisfied with the condition of the part, the service, the price, and the salesman, so I made sure to leave the wrecking yard a glowing review on google. I then spent the better part of an afternoon replacing the door on the car that we had now parked for the winter in our garage. At the time, I remember the door feeling a little bit heavier than the one I uninstalled and thinking that was odd, but I chalked it up to my imagination playing tricks on me.

Now unlike most horror stories, where a foreign object is introduced into a household and strange occurrences begin happening almost immediately, it took about one month before the strange occurrences began afflicting my household.

The first strange occurrence to afflict my household happened near the beginning of January. I was reading the morning newspaper while enjoying some pancakes drenched in table syrup and drinking a cup of coffee that my wife had prepared for breakfast, while she went out to check the mail. She came back with the mail in hand, but with consternation written all over her face. I should‚Äôve been concerned, but what you need to understand is, my wife suffers from a severe case of OCD, so I never took any of her concerns seriously. She was always finding shit to obsess and nag me about. But, on the flipside of the coin, she was smoking hot, so I thought that was a small price to pay for someone that looked like her.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter,‚Äù I humored her, dropping my cup of morning Joe from my lips and affecting concern with raised eyebrows.

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù replied my wife somewhat dismissively. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing really, just that I see some footprints in the snow‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúFootprints in the snow!‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúFor Christ‚Äôs sake honey, we‚Äôve got people delivering goods to our doorstep night and day! Of course there‚Äôs gonna be some footprints in the snow‚Äî""

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù she cried petulantly, this time cutting me short. ‚ÄúYou never let me finish! These aren‚Äôt just some delivery guy‚Äôs footprints. I followed them to see where they led, and they seem to wrap around the entirety of the house, like some thief scouting our place for the easiest point of entry.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù I said patronizingly, ‚Äúdid the footprints end at the pine tree in our back yard and some yellow snow? Maybe the delivery guy needed to take a leak and decided to use our tree for privacy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you always have to be such an argumentative asshole about everything? For fuck‚Äôs sake, no! no! no! The footprints *did not* lead to the pine tree and there was no piss!‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay I believe you,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just, you know how I get when people bother me when I‚Äôm eating. I only have a few bites left, and when those are finished I‚Äôll come out to investigate.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing,‚Äù she replied submissively. My wife, however, wouldn‚Äôt let me finish the last few bites in peace. She sat down at the table, pretended to browse the web on her phone, and started tapping her fingers and feet impatiently while waiting for me to finish, doing everything in her power to make those last few bites as miserable an experience as possible. I muttered ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù under my breath to express my displeasure, mopped up the remaining table syrup on my plate with the last few remaining bites of pancake, and wolfed it down in haste.

Once outside, she began leading me to the place where she thought she saw the prints. A storm cloud was passing overhead and it was snowing pretty heavily. At last, when we wrapped around the side of our house, I asked my wife where it was that she saw the prints.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gone!‚Äù she cried in surprise. ‚ÄúThe snow‚Äôs covered them up!‚Äù

‚ÄúPerhaps they never existed to begin with,‚Äù I said with a dismissive shrug of my shoulders.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù my wife cried indignantly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true at all and you know it! Had you come outside when I first told you about them, and not waited until you finished your breakfast and for a fucking blizzard to roll through, you would‚Äôve seen them too!‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I believe you,‚Äù I lied in attempt to defuse the situation. ‚ÄúBut what do you want me to do about it? Call the police over some footprints in the snow? They‚Äôll think I‚Äôm crazy!‚Äù

‚ÄúI just want you to be on your guard is all and keep your eyes open from this day forth‚Ä¶‚Äù

There the conversation ended, and we went back inside; but this was just the first strange occurrence in a series of many more to come. That night I retired to bed, and must have been sleeping for a couple of hours, when my wife grabbed me by the shoulder and shrieked in my ear in mortal terror:

‚ÄúHoney wake up! Wake up!‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus Christ!‚Äù I grumbled, opening one eye and glaring at her reproachfully. If there‚Äôs one thing I hate, more than being disturbed while eating a good meal, it‚Äôs being woken up prematurely from a good sleep. ‚ÄúWhat fucking time is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe time doesn‚Äôt matter! There‚Äôs a man clad in black standing just outside our garage and surveying the house! I think we should call the police!‚Äù

‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs not do anything rash,‚Äù I said, slipping on my slippers. My wife grabbed me by the wrist and lead me towards the window. She was too terrified to look out the window again herself, and instead cowered behind the wall while looking at me expectantly, waiting to see my reaction.

‚ÄúSEE? SEE?‚Äù she whispered while I scanned the entire front yard.

‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù I said, my voice thick with concern. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not a soul in sight‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a soul in sight?‚Äù she said in disbelief, finally mustering up the courage to look out the window again. ‚ÄúWhy, there was a man standing there less than half a minute ago, staring right at me! Oh! you have to believe me!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to believe you, it‚Äôs that I can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs simply no one there. Honey, I‚Äôm worried about you‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre sleep deprived and just need a good night‚Äôs rest is all,‚Äù I said, solicitously wrapping my arms around her and leading her back to bed.

The next night after that one, my sleep was interrupted not by my wife this time, but our dog Luna. My wife and I rushed out from our bedroom half-clad, and found her in the living room barking maniacally from our living room in the direction of the garage. My wife saw this as some sort of confirmation that her suspicions were correct, turned to me and cried:

‚ÄúSee? See? I‚Äôm not going crazy! Even Luna sees something!‚Äù

‚ÄúDogs bark at anything and everything,‚Äù I said dismissively, although my hair was standing on end and goosebumps had formed on my flesh. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be the first time she‚Äôs woken us up in the middle of the night. It‚Äôs probably the winter wind that‚Äôs upsetting her. Come on, let‚Äôs go back to bed.‚Äù

The next morning I came out of the washroom feeling as buoyant as a cork after having taken my morning deuce, when I was ambushed in the hallway by my wife who was a much earlier riser than me.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs January 12,‚Äù my wife said, ‚Äúdo you know what that means?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I grumbled, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre going to tell me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means that our Christmas lights and tree have been up for way too long! All of our neighbors have already taken theirs down, and we‚Äôre the only ones with them still up!‚Äù

‚ÄúGet off my ass!‚Äù I complained. ‚ÄúYou know I had every intention of taking them down the other day, I was just busy with work. I‚Äôll get to work on it this afternoon.‚Äù

When the afternoon came, I grabbed the ladder from the garage while muttering profanities under my breath, and got to work on taking down the lights. About halfway through my task, my neighbor, whom I will call George for the sake of confidentiality, pulled into his laneway for his lunchbreak, and got out of his Ford Escape. In neighborly fashion I waved at him, before asking him how everything on his side of the fence was going. I entertained his idle and pointless chatter about for about five minutes, before steering the conversation in the direction I wanted.

‚ÄúSay George,‚Äù I began, ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt seen anything‚Ä¶suspicious happening along our street as of late?‚Äù

‚ÄúSuspicious?‚Äù asked George. ‚ÄúI guess it all depends on your definition of suspicious...‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, like people going up and down this road and into my yard that don‚Äôt belong here?‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù he mused thoughtfully, ‚Äúno, I can‚Äôt say I have. The only thing I‚Äôve seen is a bunch of delivery guys coming in and out of your driveway and that‚Äôs it. Why is everything alright? Should I be concerned?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù I said with a dismissive wave of my hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. Just my wife swears she‚Äôs been seeing a man trespassing on our property. Anyways, enjoy the rest of your day George!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou too, buddy. I‚Äôll be sure to keep on eye open for you guys and let y‚Äôall know if I see anything out of place.

‚ÄúAnd say, when this whole pandemic thing is over you need to come over for a barbeque and some beers like the good ole days.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing. I‚Äôd do just about anything to get away from my wife! I think I‚Äôm finally starting to get cabin fever after having been locked up with her for so long!‚Äù

‚ÄúHa! ha! I hear you on that! My wife has been driving me up the wall too!‚Äù

George and I shared a nice hearty laugh, and I went back inside after having taken down the last of the Christmas lights. The only thing remaining was the Christmas tree, which I threw at the end of our laneway for the Christmas tree collection.

The next morning, I sat down at the dinner table to eat some French toast and drink my freshly steaming cup of morning Joe, that my wife had just prepared for me.

‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù I said, in between a sip of my coffee while reading the morning newspaper. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a lot of murders happening not far from here these past couple weeks. A home invasion in Brooklyn Park where a husband and wife were murdered in cold blood; and a man, driving a vehicle just like ours, was murdered in cold blood on a rural road outside of Bloomington‚Ä¶ Even stranger, the cops think that these two seemingly disparate murders are related and committed by the same guy and that more might follow. Pretty crazy stuff, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

My wife, however, only feigned the slightest of interest and shrugged her shoulders despondently. I put the newspaper down, looked her in the eyes and said:

‚ÄúOk, I can sense something‚Äôs eating you alive. Get it off your chest, will you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou,‚Äù my wife began, ‚Äúsaid that the part you ordered came from a vehicle that came from an impact auction, didn‚Äôt you? My theory is that someone died in the vehicle the door came from, and their spirit attached itself to the door we now have, and the spirit will forever be unwilling to leave us alone until we return it back to the wrecking yard it came from.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat makes you so convinced that the door is possessed?‚Äù I laughed.

‚ÄúThe footsteps, the appearance of the man, Luna barking throughout the night, everything that I‚Äôve seen, seems to be concentrated around the garage, where the door you just brought into this house is.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say that you‚Äôre right,‚Äù I humored her, ‚Äúand that the door is demonically possessed as you so eloquently put it‚Ä¶ Why would the spirit wait one month after arriving at our house before making its presence known?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the specifics,‚Äù she cried irritably, raising her voice, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm not an expert on paranormal activity! All I know is, our life won‚Äôt return to normal until we get rid of that door for good!‚Äù

I knew that my wife would forever be unwilling to relent on the issue. She would nag and nag and nag until I finally conceded defeat and agreed to take the door back to where it came from. Only, I was unwilling to concede defeat on something so stupid, and little did she know that I was holding an ace up my sleeve that I was hoping would end discussion on this matter forever.

‚ÄúDo you hear how ridiculous you sound? This isn‚Äôt the fucking *Conjuring*! Life isn‚Äôt a movie! Ghosts don‚Äôt exist! And if they did, they sure as shit don‚Äôt attach themselves to inanimate objects despite what Hollywood wants you to believe!

‚ÄúAnd besides, I talked with George the other day to see if he‚Äôs seen anything suspicious happening in the neighborhood as of late, and you know what he had to say?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat he hasn‚Äôt seen a fucking thing! It‚Äôs all a figment of your imagination, honey, and I‚Äôm really worried about you‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúGeorge is a stupid, sodden drunk with a below room-temp IQ!‚Äù my wife cried. ‚ÄúWhat-in-the-actual fuck! would he know about anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you talk about George like that!‚Äù I defended angrily. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a kind-hearted family man! You take that back!‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck George and fuck you too! You‚Äôre a misogynistic pig, and I regret having gave you the last five years of my life!‚Äù

She then stormed out of the kitchen, giving me the much-desired solitude I needed to enjoy my French Toast and cup of morning Joe.

The next morning, as I was eating a plate of bacon and eggs that my wife prepared for me, sunny side up just the way I like them, I heard a van pulling up to our house. I then heard a thud at the front door, and heard the same vehicle driving off. My wife opened the door, picked up a package and came back inside with a smug look on her face.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù I asked through a mouthful of food, and taking a swig of morning Joe to wash it down quickly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember having ordered anything from Amazon.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù said my wife, ripping open the package and tearing out its contents. ‚ÄúIs ghost-hunting equipment, and I‚Äôm going to use it to prove a point.‚Äù

‚ÄúGhost-hunting equipment!‚Äù I laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve lost your mind! How much did that cost? Ten bucks?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne-hundred dollars‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOne-hundred dollars!‚Äù I cried, spitting out a half-masticated bite of bacon and eggs I was thoroughly enjoying, my laughter giving way to rage. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre up to our eyeballs in debt, and you thought it would be a good idea to piss away one-hundred dollars on fucking ghost-hunting equipment? My god! I‚Äôm trying my best not to lose my cool, but you are making that extremely difficult on me right now. You need to repackage that shit right now and get a return on it while there‚Äôs still time!‚Äù

‚ÄúJust hear me out!‚Äù my wife pleaded.

‚ÄúJust this one last time; but I warn you, you‚Äôre walking a very thin line‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù my wife said, taking a deep breath before giving me an ultimatum. ‚ÄúJust let me set up this device, and use it on the door. If it comes back with a positive signature, you agree to send the door back to the scrapyard. If, on the other hand, it somehow comes back with nothing, I promise not to say another word about the door ever again, come what may, and I‚Äôll get to work on sending the device back immediately.‚Äù

Seeing as I was wholeheartedly convinced that the door was not demonically possessed and that I was in the right, I readily agreed to the proposal. Five minutes later found us in the garage, gathered around the door in anticipation. My wife, with trembling hands, raised the ghost-detector and pressed the on switch‚Äîand alas! the signal we were met with was a negative one. My wife was evidently deflated and defeated, but I of course felt nothing but jubilation.

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù I gloated in triumph. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing more than a figment of your imagination! Now get to work on repacking that stupid thing and sending it back so we can recoup our money while there‚Äôs still time.‚Äù

Without a word, and with head downcast, my wife returned to the living room and got to work on repackaging the detector‚Ä¶

I thought my wife would be a woman of her word and never bring the topic up again, but boy was I ever wrong. Our life returned to normal for nothing more than the span of eight hours, before she reopened the discussion on the door over dinner that she prepared.

‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that we‚Äôre being watched‚Äî‚Äù she said, her eyes wet with tears, showing the first signs of a nervous breakdown.

‚ÄúFor Christ‚Äôs sake!‚Äù I cried, slamming my fork and knife down on the dinner plate. ‚ÄúI thought we were off of this topic!‚Äù

‚ÄúJust hear me out!‚Äù my wife pleaded. ‚ÄúMaybe the door isn‚Äôt demonically possessed like I initially thought, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that someone, a real person, might not be after the door.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you hear how crazy you sound right now? What could anyone want with an old Civic door? It‚Äôs a fucking door!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said the wrecking yard got the vehicle from an impact auction, didn‚Äôt you? Maybe the owner of the vehicle had some sort of sentimental attachment to the door, and won‚Äôt stop until they get the door back‚Äî""

‚ÄúSentimental attachment to a door?‚Äù I cried in disbelief, cutting her short. ‚ÄúThat might be the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever heard! We‚Äôve already been over this! I talked to George and not a soul has seen anything suspicious happening on this road other than you. No more, I‚Äôm done. You‚Äôve lost your mind. I refuse to talk to you about this ever again.‚Äù‚ÄîI stormed off, leaving the rest of my dinner untouched.

That night my wife and I went to sleep on opposite sides of the bed, and when I woke the next morning it was without the familiar scent of breakfast and coffee assailing my nostrils. I found my wife at the front door, fully dressed with her winter boots on and with Luna standing at her side.

‚ÄúYou taking the dog outside to do her business?‚Äù I asked while yawning and scratching my head. ‚ÄúAnd say, where‚Äôs breakfast at?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm done,‚Äù my wife sniffled laconically while zipping-up her coat and turning her back to me.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you‚Äôre done?‚Äù I asked innocently, but narrowing my eyes suspiciously. ‚ÄúDone with staying put in the house?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm done with *us* you fucking halfwit!‚Äù she snapped while sobbing and turning back around to face me. ‚Äú I can‚Äôt do this anymore! Until you admit that there‚Äôs a serious problem facing this household, and that there‚Äôs something or someone stalking the house, I‚Äôm done with *us* and never coming back. I‚Äôve booked myself a room in a hotel for the next week. You have precisely seven days to sort this shit out, at the end of which time I‚Äôll be seeing a divorce lawyer. Goodbye.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù I spat, seething with anger, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just fucking like you! Threatening me with divorce over another one of your goddamn hallucinations! And now you‚Äôre wasting money we don‚Äôt have on a hotel room? My god! Whatever, I‚Äôm past the point of caring; walk you fucking headcase! But you ain‚Äôt taking Luna with you, I‚Äôll tell you that right fucking now. Luna! Come here girl!‚Äù

Luna was just about to run over to me when my wife scooped her up in her arms and darted out of the house. I chased the two out of the door, following hot on their heels, but my wife had too much of a jump on me and had already prepared her escape. She had the Chevy Equinox already warmed up and the snow scraped off the front and back windshields. She jumped in the vehicle and quickly locked the doors behind her.

‚ÄúGive her back!‚Äù I screamed like a maniac, running alongside the vehicle and slapping viciously on window while she sped off. ‚ÄúYou fucking bitch! Give her back now!‚Äù

But it was no use. She reached the road and sped off, while some of the neighbors came out to watch me freaking out in my morning robe and slippers like an idiot. Embarrassed, I hastened back inside as quick as I could and slammed the door behind me. I went to the fridge, threw the door open angrily, grabbed some beer, threw on the tv and then put in an order for extra large meat lover‚Äôs pizza, just the way I like it, that was to arrive within an hour. About eight beers deep, the pizza had not come, and I couldn‚Äôt resist the urge to doze off‚Ä¶

I was woken up by the sound of my phone ringing and vibrating like a motherfucker. It was now dark outside, and the tv I was watching had turned off automatically. ‚ÄúJust how long was I out for?‚Äù I pondered. I managed to pick up my phone a second before it went to voicemail, and to my great displeasure, it was my wife‚Äôs Karen-like voice on the other end.

‚ÄúHoney!‚Äù she screamed in a panic. ‚ÄúYou need to get out of the house, now!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I drawled drunkenly, rising to my feet and looking over my shoulders in a panic. ‚ÄúIs the house burning down or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! the house isn‚Äôt burning down but your life is in grave danger! I‚Äôm on my way back as we speak, but you need to get out of the house, now, before it‚Äôs too late! There‚Äôs something inside of the door, something that someone‚Äôs after. It‚Äôs the reason why the man in Bloomington and the couple in Brooklyn Park were murdered and your life is in jeopardy‚Äî""

There was a knock on the door.

A couple seconds later the doorbell wrung.

‚ÄúHang on,‚Äù I interrupted, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs someone knocking on the door‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs probably the pizza guy; I‚Äôll call you back in a moment‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT ANSWER IT!‚Äù she tried warning me. ‚ÄúWHATEVER YOU DO DON‚ÄôT ANSWER THAT DOOR‚Äî‚Äù but I hung up. What can I say? I was wasted beyond belief and had no idea how much danger I was in, despite my wife‚Äôs warnings. Without so much as a second thought, I drunkenly stumbled to the door and threw it wide open, only to see nothing but empty space before me, no car in the laneway, just the pizza that I had ordered hours before with the receipt stapled to the box and that had unceremoniously been thrown on the ground.

‚ÄúHow strange!‚Äù I drawled drunkenly. ‚ÄúThe pizzaman didn‚Äôt even wait for me to tip him before taking off. My god! am I ever hungry‚Ä¶‚Äù I stooped down to pick up my pizza and the next thing I knew a blunt instrument was crashing down on the top of my skull. Everything faded to black‚Ä¶

When I woke, I was conscious of the fact that my hands and feet were bound, that I was seated on a wooden chair, and that there was a sock stuffed in my mouth. Everything was a red haze because of the blood running in a current down my face from where I was struck and pooling in my eyes. A man within arm‚Äôs reach, clad all in black and wearing a face mask, was working on putting the trim panel of the rear passenger-side Civic door back in place. I shut my eyes and reopened them. No, this wasn‚Äôt a dream; there really was a man putting the trim panel on the door back into place. Naturally and automatically, I began struggling against my bindings. When he became aware that I had regained consciousness, he looked back at me and said:

‚ÄúAh! you‚Äôre awake! I‚Äôm so glad you can finally join me! If you promise not to scream like a woman and wake up the whole neighborhood, I‚Äôll be so kind as to remove that sock from your mouth; can you do that for me?‚Äù

I nodded my assent, wide-eyed with terror, and the man removed the sock from my mouth. The first words that escaped my trembling lips were:

‚ÄúWhat‚Äîah! my fucking head is splitting‚Äîthe hell is going on here!‚Äù

The villain went on to humor my request and explain everything.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on,‚Äù he began, while going about his task at the same time, ‚Äúis you happened to be in possession of something of mine; something extremely valuable. Here, take a look at this‚Äî‚Äù he threw a bundle in my lap that must have weighed at least 10 pounds.

‚ÄúWhat am I looking at?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre looking at is a bundle of fentanyl pills worth around one-quarter of a million dollars, and that was hidden inside of the door you purchased from the wrecking yard. While you spent the last five minutes regaining your consciousness after I pistol whipped you, I spent that time dismantling the door you purchased to recover my product.

‚ÄúI get it, I get it, you‚Äôre confused, and rightfully so; I would be too if I was in your shoes. But here, let me explain:

‚ÄúBack in November of last year, I was running some fentanyl that I manufactured from America into Canada, when the Honda I was driving, the same model and color as yours, hit a patch of black ice before I even made it to the border. I veered off the road going around eighty miles per hour, and went head on with a tree. The accident fucked me up bad, and the next thing I knew I was waking up in the ICU two weeks later, not knowing what the hell had happened. Fortunately, my wife was by my bedside to fill in the gap in my memory.

‚ÄúThe first thing I needed to do was track the movement of my vehicle. I asked my wife in a panic what happened to our vehicle, and she, who I keep in the dark about my line of work‚Äîthe innocent soul still thinks I make my fortune through crypto‚Äîinformed me that the vehicle was fucked up beyond repair, that she was left with no other choice but to write it off, and that it ended up in an impact auction. The first thing I did after recovering from my injuries was to call the impact auction and ask them what happened to my vehicle. They were kind enough to inform me the exact wrecking yard that it had been sold to. Simple enough, I foolishly thought. All that needs to be done is to purchase all four doors from the wrecking yard, and I would once more be in possession of the million dollars‚Äô worth of product I had lost. If only things had been that simple‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI drove to the wrecking yard only to discover, to my horror, that all four doors had been sold to who-the-fuck knows where, and that‚Äôs when the panic began to set in. Before leaving, I asked the sales-desk if they knew where those doors went. They gave me a strange look for asking such a weirdly pointed question, said that they had no clue and that even if they did, they were legally obligated to protect customer information.

‚ÄúI had no choice but to break into their office later that night after closing, and access that information myself on their computers. After some digging, I was able to find the addresses I was looking for easily enough, and went on my way.

‚ÄúFortunately, unlike you, the front driver‚Äôs side door I was after, was on a Civic that was a couple‚Äôs daily driver, and they left their vehicle parked in their laneway; meaning, I could go about my work during the night with everyone being none the wiser‚Äîor so I thought.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you heard about the double homicide home invasion that happened two weeks ago in Brooklyn Park? Yeah, that was me. What was supposed to be a simple in-and-out job, quickly became an unmitigated disaster. I broke into the vehicle without tripping the alarm, and just as I finished retrieving my product and putting the trim panel back on the door and popping the window switch into place, the porch light turned on. The next thing I knew I found myself involved in a shootout. I managed to emerge victorious, only taking a grazing bullet to my shoulder while shooting my opponent in the head. I then went into the house to stage the whole thing to look like a home invasion. I killed his wife in cold blood, ruffled some things around in haste, made off with my product, and the police never suspected a thing.

‚ÄúThe front passenger‚Äôs side door that I was after was in Bloomington, and this time it belonged to a single man in his early thirties, and fortunately his Civic was his daily driver as well. I was unwilling to make the same mistake I made last time in attempting to get the goods out in the open in someone‚Äôs laneway, so this time I stalked this man‚Äôs daily movements. I tailed him going down a deserted stretch of rural road on his one-hour commute to a construction site outside of the city, and fender-bendered him. I got him to pull over under the pretense of exchanging insurance information. That‚Äôs when I popped him in the head and made off with my second parcel of goods.

‚ÄúNow only two more bundles remained, and one of them you were in unwitting possession of. I rented an Air B&B not far from here and spent the last week casing your place out. When I discovered that your vehicle was parked for the winter, I realized I had a real problem on my hands. I then waited and waited and waited for the right moment to go in and pluck the goods when you and your wife were away from the house. The goal was to go about this as discreetly and with as little bloodshed as possible, but unfortunately you two made that an impossible task for me. All I needed was a fifteen-minute window to break into your house and do what needed doing, but alas! the window of opportunity never came. You and your wife refused to leave the house for an entire week, and that dog of yours, that Cerberus, kept giving away my movements every time I tried forcing an entry during the night. I only have so much patience and a life I need to return to, and you two left me with no other choice than to go about this the direct way.

‚ÄúWhen I saw your wife storming off from the house in a huff with your dog and her bags packed earlier today, I was able to deduce that you two had a falling out and all I had to contend with was you and that my moment arrived at last. I waited until it got dark, and then pounced on my opportunity.

‚ÄúWell, that brings us up to the present,‚Äù he said, popping the window switch back into place, packing his tools up, and pocketing the parcel of drugs, ‚Äúand that concludes my work here. Ha! I‚Äôve become more proficient in the art of removing trim panels than I ever thought I would need to be! After tonight, I have only one more package to reclaim and then I can finally put this disaster to bed, although that one happens to be in another state entirely‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why the door felt so heavy when I was putting it on,‚Äù I said, shaking my head in disbelief. ‚ÄúBut why not just show up at my door and make me an offer for the door I couldn‚Äôt refuse? I would‚Äôve been willing to give you the door for anything you were willing to offer!‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought about doing just that,‚Äù the villain said, nodding his head in agreement, ‚Äúwhen I saw that you and your wife wouldn‚Äôt budge from the house, but I couldn‚Äôt take the risk. On paper you might say that you would‚Äôve been willing to take whatever I offered for it, and then there was always the chance that you would get curious, tell me to go fuck myself, and check what was inside of the door yourself. Then you might‚Äôve called the cops, who would‚Äôve traced the door back to the wrecking yard and back to me, and I would be looking at blowing out my birthday candles in a cell for the rest of my life. No, as I said before, this was something that needed to be done as discreetly as possibly, with no one none the wiser.

‚ÄúBut, as I‚Äôve already said, my work here is concluded, and I‚Äôve told you too much. I‚Äôll have to stage this to look like nothing more than a regular-old home invasion. You better start saying your Hail Marys...‚Äù

The villain reached into his coat jacket, produced a silenced pistol and pointed it at my forehead.

I closed my eyes in fear and fought ferociously against my bonds while whimpering like a baby:

‚ÄúNO, PLEASE! You don‚Äôt have to do this! I won‚Äôt tell a soul about what happened here tonight! I promise!‚Äù

‚ÄúHa! ha! look at the piss running down your leg!‚Äù he laughed hysterically (just for the record, and sorry for barging in here and ruining the pacing of the story at such a climactic moment, I never pissed myself; he just made that up to humiliate me further and to indulge his twisted sense of humor, and I left what he said in the story for the sake of transparency‚Ä¶) ‚ÄúIt never ceases to amaze me just how much you sheep fear the grim reaper and cling onto life! I promise you, death isn‚Äôt so terrifying when you think about it; nothing more than everlasting sleep is all. Goodbye friend‚Äî‚Äù

At this point I heard a gunshot, my head retreated into my chest like a tortoise‚Äôs head retreating into its shell, and my ears were ringing like a bitch. I was fully convinced that I had just been shot and that my time here on earth had been cut short. I refused to open my eyes and thought to myself *so this really is what death feels like...eternal darkness, just like the villain said.* But just as the thought passed through my head, I heard something metallic clatter on the ground, and felt the rope binding my hands behind my back being frantically sawed through.

I opened my eyes, surveyed the scene in front of me, and immediately understood what had happened. The villain was lying in a puddle of his own blood on the garage floor, and his brains were splattered all over the wall to my right. The thing that I heard clatter on the pavement was the handgun my wife always carried on her person, and the one she must've just used to save my life. My wife finished sawing the ropes that bound my hands, and began working on the ones that bound my feet.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù my wife looked up at me solicitously while hugging my leg (would she have been hugging my leg if I had pissed myself like the villain said? No? that‚Äôs what I thought), with tears running down her cheeks. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù‚Äîshe repeated.

‚ÄúYou came back for me!‚Äù I cried in disbelief. ‚ÄúHow? And why?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen I stormed off today, I booked a room at the nearest dog-friendly hotel fifteen minutes away. I spent the day sobbing, eating ice cream and binge-watching Sherlock Holmes, the one we usually watch together, to try and console myself. Around an hour before I called you, an episode called ‚Äúthe Six Thatchers‚Äù came on.

‚ÄúThe episode is an interesting one, where a criminal smashes busts of Margaret Thatcher trying to find a memory stick he hid inside of one many years before. While watching the episode, I saw a number of things that paralleled our situation and it was then when I was finally able to put two and two together.

‚ÄúI remembered the conversation we had at the dinner table, the one about the man dying outside of Bloomington, and how he happened to drive a vehicle like ours, and the couple who were murdered in Brooklyn Park, and how the police thought the murders were related, and that‚Äôs when the light bulb went off over my head.

‚Äú‚ÄòHoly shit!‚Äô I cried, ‚ÄòMaybe, just maybe, the problem wasn‚Äôt with the door like I originally thought, but what‚Äôs inside of the door! My god I have to call him right now!‚Äô

‚ÄúI reached for my phone and called you without a moment‚Äôs hesitation. My first call went to voicemail, so I hung up and tried and again, beginning to fear the worst. This time you picked up a second before the phone was going to send me to voicemail, and that‚Äôs when I tried warning you.

‚ÄúYou, however, being the stubborn fool that you are, hung up on me while telling me that someone was knocking on the door, and I knew that something was seriously wrong. I called the police, and they told me they wouldn‚Äôt be able to send help for at least another hour. That‚Äôs when I sped off from the hotel, breaking every traffic law on my way over to save your life.

‚ÄúThe criminal left the front door unlocked, so I was able to sneak into the house undetected. As I crept to the garage, all my nerves were on edge and my hands were shaking as I gripped the handgun I always carry in my purse. Oh, honey! when I saw you bound there with a gun pressed to your forehead, I was so terrified, but I knew what had to be done. I didn‚Äôt hesitate to pull the trigger.

‚ÄúAnd what do you mean by ‚Äòwhy‚Äô? Despite everything that happened this past week, I still love you, and that‚Äôs reason enough. Everything‚Äôs going to be okay. The police will be here any minute now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were right about everything!‚Äù I sobbed pathetically, finally coming to the realization that I had the most selfless, solicitous, intelligent, and loving wife on the planet. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt deserve you at all‚Ä¶‚Äù",0,1737829747.0,nosleep,0,0.5,False

I never dated through highschool and I really wanted that to change for college. I've been on a few dates but they either end bad, worse than bad, or soul crushing. I'm not being a jerk. I've meet girls both in person or online though social media. My general rule is talk to them for the week and if it's a good conversation with interest on both sides then ask her out for coffee. That's what happened this week, I asked a girl out for Saturday (today) at noon and confirmed with her this morning if we were still on. But she claims she couldnt make it because of a zumba class. I was disappointed but I said ""well if you ever wanna try for another time let me know what works for you"" she said ""yes sorry for the late notice I'll keep that in mind!!"" But I'm not expecting a reply. I understand people genuinely get busy sometimes, but this one seems like a stretch to me. Especially bc she could have just offered a new time say like 2:00pm right then and there but she didn't.

Am I doing something wrong? I'm trying to be friendly but also trying to show that I'm interested in them. I haven't gotten a single second date yet and I've tried asking 5 girls.

Is it just stupid to look for a committed relationship in college. Because everyone else seems to be all fine and lovey dovey with their girlfriends. I'm not desperate, and I know my worth. But man does it get lonely.

All I want is someone outside of my family to love me unconditionally. Someone I can hold at nightime and wake up next to. Someone I can talk to about anything anywhere, and listen when she needs it. Why is it this hard!?

1i9tapr,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1i9tapr/why_on_earth_do_vc_growth_equity_firms_recruit/,Why on Earth do VC / growth equity firms recruit bankers?,"I'm currently exploring IB recruitment‚Äì I don't have a target school on my resume but I have some relevant experience and a high GPA. Not interested in being a career banker but I could see myself doing something longer term in like an earlier stage investing role, something like VC or growth equity. I've been networking A LOT, and have completed like 20+ coffee chats with both bankers (mostly in tech / TMT related roles given this is what I'm targeting) as well as some folks in buy side roles I find interesting. Just using RecruiterBase to find these specific connections and contact info. 

While I'm making decent connections, and can see a few of these turning into actionable recruitment opportunities, something has drastically stood out to me given what I've learned about these industries so far, as mentioned in this post title. During coffee chats, I like to actually learn about what the job function entails, which I generally have the chance to do after answering basic behavioral questions. It feels like, most folks in VC / growth equity do a LOT of sourcing (cold calling, emails, etc.), networking, and it seems like a deep understanding of technology, tech trends, and the ""hottest"" early startups is important for these roles. When I ask investors about what makes someone successful in growth investing or whatever, none of them mention anything about banking skills. Instead they talk about:

* Being able to spot the ""next big thing"" in tech before anyone else
* Understanding complex technical problems well enough to not get bullshitted by founders
* Being personable while sourcing deals and having genuine relationships with entrepreneurs (who let's be real, probably don't think ex-bankers are worth their time)

But when I ask bankers about their job, it's all abt working on financial models, perfecting PowerPoint slides, Excel shortcuts, process worth, etc. I get why megafunds, buyout PE shops, and corp dev teams would hire bankers, don't get me wrong. But how does the IB skillset translate to evaluating startups and VC / GE roles? I brought this up with a partner at a middle market growth equity fund a few days ago and he said ""most ex-bankers we hire spend their first year unlearning everything from banking."" Then why are they still the primary hiring pool? 

Is this just ""how it's always been"" and this disconnect is real indeed? I'm curious to get some insight here, because if IB actually doesn't prepare you for earlier stage roles, I might just try to break straight into growth equity or venture capital. Plz let me know what I'm missing.",7,1737829342.0,FinancialCareers,15,0.82,False
1i9tamj,https://v.redd.it/o140y48um6fe1,Studying espresso,"Hi all,

Ever since I‚Äôve upgraded to a Rocket Giotto, my old Cafelat Robot Barista, has been collecting dust. So I figured why not try and use it as a bit of a hobby science project.

So I got an arduino UNO r4 WiFi, and turned it into a high frequency (200hz) data acquisition tool which can stream data to my laptop which then stores and visualises it real-time.

Now, I‚Äôm planning on studying the dynamics of espresso: so primarily, I want to investigate the relation between pressure (in) and espresso weight (out). But as I have room for 6 sensors, I have 4 left. So I‚Äôm reaching out to you what other data do you think might be relevant? 

This is what I got now:

Continuous dynamic signals:
- Weight: coffee out
- Pressure in the chamber
- Temperature of the chamber 

Static:
- Humidity
- Room temperature

Any tips are very welcome. Many thanks! :)

Been fighting with Consumer Affairs, dealer, Recall dept since Jan2.

Dealer says problem was caused by after-market charger.  CA says I voided my warrantee by using an after-market charger, and the recall had already been fixed 4/5/2024 and 7/31/2024.  They want me to pay out of warrantee for repairs, and won‚Äôt buy out my lease.

They did offer me $100 for my trouble, OR a discount on my next Hyundai.
