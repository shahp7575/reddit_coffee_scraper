I (F22) moved to Brisbane around 6‚Äì7 months ago and I‚Äôve been finding it really hard to make genuine friendships. I‚Äôd love to have some girlfriends to hang out with, go for coffee, go shopping, or just have fun chats.

I‚Äôm open to making male friends too, but I‚Äôm mainly craving that female friendship vibe, like having a small circle of girls to talk to, do things with, and feel at home around.

If you‚Äôve been in the same situation, how did you make friends here? Any apps, places, or ideas that helped you connect with people genuinely?

Would love to hear your experiences ‚ù§Ô∏è

1o528ub,https://i.redd.it/hfbbhs1v7ruf1.jpeg,Halloween movie night party for young adults in southern Brooklyn,"The Marine Park Young Adults Association is excited to host our Second Annual Halloween Movie Night Party on Friday, October 17th at 5 PM at Marine Park Coffee, located at 3411 Avenue S. This year‚Äôs celebration will feature a double horror movie event perfect for spooky season.

We‚Äôll kick off the night with Halloween II (1981), directed by John Carpenter, which is often regarded as the best sequel to the original 1978 classic. The film picks up right where Halloween left off, continuing the terrifying story of ‚Äúthe night he came home‚Äù as Michael Myers stalks Haddonfield once more. While suspenseful, Halloween II is considered less frightening than many modern horror films, making it a great entry point for those who want a Halloween scare without being overwhelmed.

Following that, we‚Äôll show Barbarian (2022), a modern horror thriller directed by Zach Cregger, who has recently earned critical acclaim for his new release Weapons. Barbarian is filled with chilling twists and a more intense atmosphere, creating a scarier and more shocking experience compared to the classic slasher style of Halloween II. To make the night flexible and welcoming for everyone, guests are encouraged to come for one or both films ‚Äî you don‚Äôt have to stay for the entire double feature.

To add to the fun, we‚Äôll be awarding a prize for Best Costume, with the winner receiving a gift from a local restaurant chosen by our Board. Attendees can also enjoy free popcorn, candy, and soft drinks throughout the evening.

The event has just a $5 cover fee at the door and is open to young adults ages 18 to 35. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of classic slashers, modern horror hits, or just looking for a fun community night out, this event promises to deliver a memorable evening of scares, laughs, and Halloween cheer.

I've been a thermal carafe fan ever since learning that coffee doesn't have to taste burnt if you don't drink it right away.  This model seems well-regarded overall (with the possible exception of its documentation) but I'm not chasing the ""perfect"" cup yet; a ""good"" one suits me fine.

I recently discovered it can act like a French press if you brew without the carafe lid on.  The brewer lets the water steep for about four minutes before releasing it into the carafe, and the flavor is fantastic.  But the lid design puzzles me during this use case: it always pushes up on the release lever, which stops the steeping process.  So if you want to use this ""French press-ish"" method, you can't have the lid on, and your coffee cools faster than it otherwise would if the lid remained on.

Are there any alternate lids that could keep the carafe sealed without triggering that lever?  I was picturing something like a concave lid with a pressure flap and vent holes to let air escape, but I'm no engineer.  I also don't know if there's a food-safe, high-temp 3D printing filament that could work.

I come to this subreddit for a shred of hope that my curiosity may be sated.

Earlier this summer I noticed a lot of coffee creamer pods littered along the street and sidewalk. The bright blues and reds of pods both full and crushed draw the eye and by the 10th creamer found over the course of a half mile's walk down Lake Street, drew my curiosity as well. ""Perhaps these were trickling out of a garbage truck"" I mused, and didn't think much of it. Until the next day I used the other sidewalk for the same route and to my surprise there were also a notable number of creamer pods along that side too. Some in the street, some on the sidewalk, some even in people's yards. ""Maybe this was a prank, a bunch of rabblerousers with more creamers than sense decided to throw these along the street for a laugh."" This explanation kept me content until I found two espresso pods the same shape as the creamers also along this route. So it wasn't simply an overabundance of creamers. Still, I assured myself this was all just some teenage prank. I continued to less convincingly assure myself of this as I found more of these creamers littered along Lexington and some of the side streets of the area. I was nearly sure I was finding new creamers every day in places I hadn't seen them before but I couldn't prove they weren't blown there. I was being gaslit by a fake dairy product.  

It wasn't until I found another handful littered all the way on the other side of Hardy Pond, in a quiet back street that my curiosity overwhelmed me and I began to feel like I was going mad. I told my roommates who were either uninterested or amused by my distress. I toyed with asking this subreddit but knew I'd be ridiculed. After a month I was fairly certain I wasn't finding any new creamers and this became a weird story I didn't have anyone to tell. I had to learn to accept my confusion and move on. 

And I did! I hadn't thought about these creamers until a few weeks ago, to my surprise I saw one. I assured myself it was from earlier this summer. Then I saw another. Then I saw a third, still full, and in the street. There's no way that one survived the summer intact. It was happening again. I took a video in disbelief to show my roommates who continued to laugh at me. I gasped when two days later I found two more, this time one in a color I hadn't even seen before! I've since found around eight more in new places every few days and I have had to grapple with the fact The Creamening was upon us once again. 

These creamers. They vex me. I simply must know why they keep appearing to haunt me. Who are you, cream-bringer? What compels you?? I hope one of you has answers. Perhaps I will never know but maybe you, my neighbors here in the Lakeview area, will share in my misery as the bright blues and reds of creamers catch your eye as you stroll around the neighborhood. I can't suffer alone anymore. ",1,1760306656.0,Waltham,0,1.0,False

In Churchill's famous 'We shall fight on the beaches' speech, he ends with a remark that even if the UK was captured and starving, the Empire overseas would continue the fight until 'in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the Old'. 

'What on earth is she talking about', I hear you cry?

I know this is blunt, but given our evident free-speech problem, our inability to present a credible response, and the difficulty of recognizing and elevating a legitimate leader safely in the UK, one might consider whether an alternative approach could add something while all of that is... sorted out in time. And it will take time. 

An creative approach around some of that could be to declare and recognize a 'Transgender Embassy of the United Kingdom' in the United States, through which legitimacy can be built, free speech can be exercised, and a voice can be recognized / heard. It could be an external way to apply pressure on the British Government and potentially attack that 'only Forstater gets quotes' issue. I just think it might be harder to ignore with the right approach. 

Obviously it wouldn't need to have a physical presence. I can see value in continuing and pushing the fight in a credible and legitimate way from overseas. Somewhere out of their control and an annoying presence.

https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/family-4-found-dead-san-francisco-21095039.ph

Authorities have released the identities of the family members who were found dead in a San Francisco home Wednesday afternoon. 

The four people found in the home on the 900 block of Monterey Boulevard on the city‚Äôs west side were Thomas Ocheltree, 57, Paula Truong, 52, a 12-year-old girl and a 9-year-old girl, the San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner told SFGATE in an email. Neighbors and relatives told several media outlets that Ocheltree and Truong were married and the two girls were their children. 

The medical examiner is performing a toxicology analysis to determine the family‚Äôs cause of death and declined to provide further comment. 

The family was discovered during a welfare check, the San Francisco Police Department said. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the wellness check came after Ocheltree‚Äôs brother hadn‚Äôt heard from him in days and found them deceased. (The Chronicle and SFGATE are both owned by Hearst but have separate newsrooms.)
As of Friday afternoon, police are classifying the deaths as ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù but have not officially called it a homicide investigation. The department‚Äôs homicide unit is leading the investigation. 

City records show that in 2014, Ocheltree and Truong purchased the three-bedroom home for $1,135,743 and that Truong became the primary owner. Following the sale, Truong accumulated mountains of debt and was named in several civil lawsuits, court records show.

In February 2024, the city notified the couple that their home was entering the foreclosure process because of delinquent mortgage payments. The $2.24 million loan, which the couple took out in March 2022, was also in default, according to property records. 
The home then sold in a public auction in Oct. 31, 2024, for just over $2 million to a financial company.

In one civil case, Truong was sued in January by Discover Bank for allegedly failing to pay $17,716.26 in credit card debt. In April, a San Francisco judge ordered that Truong must pay the banking company $18,157.26.

The family also owned several businesses, some of which have shuttered. According to San Francisco records of registered businesses, Truong owned a property at 3150 24th St., which is now the location of Wise Sons Jewish Delicatessen.

Evan Bloom, a co-owner of the deli, told the SF Standard that he leased the space from the couple. He did not respond to SFGATE‚Äôs request for comment. 

According to her LinkedIn page, Truong also appeared to be the founder of Orbit Coffee, which had two locations in Oakland and one in San Jose, according to its website. Though an Instagram account with the shop‚Äôs name is still active, Orbit Coffee shows as ‚Äútemporarily closed‚Äù on Google.

In a 2022 article on Sprudge, a coffee blog, Truong told the author that as a Vietnam War refugee, she opened the shop to showcase her version of Vietnamese coffee and connect with her roots. 

Ocheltree‚Äôs LinkedIn page also shows that he was involved in several small businesses, mentioning his wife as his ‚Äúbusiness partner‚Äù in his bio. One is Zentrum Motors, an auto repair shop with a Yelp page that shows that it is still open. 

He‚Äôs also listed as the owner of Ocheltree Design Branding and Packaging, a graphic design business specializing in wine, beer and spirits. One of the wine bottle designs on what appears to be the business‚Äôs website shows that he created a label named after his daughter and it was from the year of her birth.

A buddy of mine met his current partner through Reddit, so I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It‚Äôs definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I‚Äôve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast, made my way through the Ozarks, and now I‚Äôm slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever‚Äôs on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it‚Äôs a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I‚Äôm more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I‚Äôm pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who‚Äôs curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn‚Äôt mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I‚Äôm drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don‚Äôt have to be a traveler (though that‚Äôs always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

1o521k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1o521k3/my_coffee_journey/,My Coffee journey,"My Coffee Journey

I never liked coffee. I only started drinking it in my thirties, and even then, I never really liked it all that much. My wife had a drip machine and would make a pot every morning, so I‚Äôd have half a cup ‚Äî maybe a full one ‚Äî just for the caffeine boost. I always found the taste boring, bitter, and sometimes it reminded me of an ashtray or burnt toast. It was rare that I‚Äôd ever have more than one cup.

Then, two summers ago, our family went to an Airbnb. They had a De'Longhi La Specialista all-in-one espresso machine. I was excited to use it for the novelty, but I didn‚Äôt expect anything more from it. Since I‚Äôd never really liked any of the coffee I‚Äôd had up to that point, the experience of using the machine felt more interesting than drinking the coffee itself.

That first morning, I woke up early, went downstairs, found the manual, and after some fumbling, managed to make an espresso. I mixed it with hot water to make an Americano. I‚Äôll never forget those first few sips. I was blown away. It was the best coffee I had ever had ‚Äî smooth, creamy, full of flavor. It wasn‚Äôt bitter like the drip or diner coffees I knew. For the first time, I actually liked it.

I spent the rest of that week eager to make coffee for everyone at the Airbnb. I wanted to share the discovery that coffee could actually taste good. I made Americanos, espressos, and a few less-than-perfect lattes. I couldn‚Äôt get over how much I enjoyed something I‚Äôd spent so many years dismissing.

When the vacation ended and we went home, I knew I wanted my own espresso machine. But which one? I had no idea what they cost. The La Specialista was over $1,000 CAD at the time ‚Äî a shock, considering our drip machine had cost only $100. A friend convinced me that a fully automatic model was the way to go. That opened another world of machines to research, all with a steep price tag.

As the weeks went by, the options and costs overwhelmed me. Months passed, and I moved on, returning to my half-cup of uninspired drip coffee.

A year later, we ended up at the same Airbnb again. Sure enough, the La Specialista was still there. And just like before, I had the same experience ‚Äî Americanos and espressos every day, each one delicious. By the end of the week, I‚Äôd decided: this time, I was getting an espresso machine.

When we got home, I started researching again. I compared all-in-one and fully automatic machines and finally chose a Miele CM 6160. My main reason was that I wanted something both my wife and I could use easily. At the Airbnb, she‚Äôd never touched the espresso machine; I‚Äôd always made the drinks for both of us. The Miele cost $1,400, but I was ready for it.

After some dialing in ‚Äî as much as you can do with a super-automatic ‚Äî I loved the results. I was making espressos and ristrettos, Americanos, flat whites, and cappuccinos. I loved it.

Then the milk frother broke. I thought I might have to return the machine. While I waited for support, I started looking into semi-automatics and found myself completely absorbed. There was so much to learn. In a way, I even hoped the Miele would be unrepairable so I‚Äôd have an excuse to buy one. To my slight disappointment, and to Miele‚Äôs credit, they sent a technician to my house who repaired it quickly and free of charge.

Since then, I‚Äôve been dreaming of a semi-automatic. The Miele makes excellent espresso and coffee drinks, but when a friend made me a shot from his Flair 58 manual espresso maker, I could taste the difference ‚Äî small but exciting. It was thicker, more syrupy, rounder. Now I find myself watching espresso-workflow videos on Instagram and learning from YouTube. I can‚Äôt justify a semi-auto right now, but that‚Äôs what I want.

Around that same time, I discovered specialty coffee. I bought a bag of light roast from a local roaster who warned me it was very sweet and fruity. When I tried making espresso with it, though, all I got was sourness. I asked my wife to taste it.
‚ÄúDoes this taste like a lemon to you? Or maybe a plum without any sweetness?‚Äù
She agreed. It was sour.

I kept trying to dial it in, adjusting settings to fix the shot. I managed to reduce the sourness, but bitterness crept in instead. Online, everyone described light roasts as ‚Äúsweet, fruity, and acidic.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt get it. So I went to a specialty caf√© and had them make me a shot ‚Äî and again, it tasted sour to me. Not off or spoiled, just sour-forward. I tried another caf√©, same result. I eventually understood that what others called ‚Äújuicy‚Äù or ‚Äúacidic,‚Äù I simply didn‚Äôt like. I was a little disappointed; it felt like I‚Äôd hit the end of new flavors I‚Äôd truly enjoy.

During all this, I learned about pour-overs. I thought maybe I‚Äôd like those fruity beans that way. I enjoy black tea ‚Äî especially jasmine ‚Äî so when I found a specialty roaster offering an $18 pour-over with jasmine notes, I thought, this might be the one.
It wasn‚Äôt.
It was complex, floral, acidic, fruity, and coffee all at once ‚Äî the most complex cup I‚Äôd ever had ‚Äî and I didn‚Äôt like it at all.

I‚Äôve learned that I like medium to medium-dark roasts: full-bodied, rich, smooth, creamy, nutty, chocolatey. Now that I‚Äôve tried the specialty light roasts, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing out. I understand them; I just don‚Äôt enjoy them.

So that‚Äôs my coffee journey so far. I know what I like, and I really like what I like. A good shot of espresso still excites me ‚Äî the flavor, the texture, the warmth of it. My next step is to keep trying beans with the profiles I enjoy. Right now, I‚Äôm using a medium roast from the same specialty shop where I tried that pour-over ‚Äî and I love it. It‚Äôs chocolate-forward without bitterness.

But what I really want is a semi-automatic machine with a separate grinder. I want the full workflow experience. I want to see just how good an espresso can be. One day, I‚Äôll get that machine. For now, I‚Äôll enjoy what my super-automatic pumps out each morning.

(Wagner plays in background, the volume decreasing)



Jack:		I've listened to that every morning for the last four months and I'm still not used to it.

Bobbie:			I think that's the point.

Jack:		Another day, more readings to take. Let's get all our readings taken before we wake them.

Bobbie:		Fine by me. How about something to eat while we're waiting? I'll get us something after I check the pods. This should only take a minute.

Narrator:		Bobbie records what would be the last of her readings from the pods. After today there would be no more use for them. Everyone was needed now that they were close to landing. Bobbie especially looked forward to getting some tools in her hands and making use of her skills.

Bobbie:		Here. I would say I cooked all day to make it but I don't need the insult.

Jack:		I think they may have been a little too honest when they labeled this tube. It says protein matter and animal fat. Uh, yum. Don't look at me that way I'm serious. Look.

Bobbie (laughing): To think I would one day regret truth in advertising laws.

Jack:				Maybe we should go ahead and wake them up.

Narrator:		Jack sets aside the food tube and they head towards the pods.

Bobbie:			Sue should be first in case we have a problem with Tom.

Narrator:		Bobbie activates the waking cycle on Sue's pod and waits. Bobbie remembered Sue had said the awakening process takes about fifteen minutes before any results would be seen. Soon the frost on the pod‚Äôs cover began to melt away and Sue's image came into sharper view. This was going to continue at a slow pace. Bobbie then starts the process on Tom‚Äôs pod. Over the next few hours Bobbie continued to take readings and watch for signs of life. Eventually Sue could be seen slowly moving her hands. A few minutes more and the pod opened, releasing Sue from her wintery cocoon.

(Sound of vacuum hiss)

Bobbie:		Take it easy. Just like you told us. Move your arms a little bit. Now move your feet in small circles. That's right. A few minutes of that and Jack and I will get you out of there.

Narrator:		Sue did as instructed and became fully aware of her surroundings.  She sat up on her elbows and looked around the control module as if seeing it for the first time.

Sue:				The ship. The ship! I saw it explode. We were on it. It's old.

Bobbie:		It's ok. Jack, give me a hand here. Help me get her over to her seat.

Narrator:		Jack and Bobbie maneuver Sue to her seat and strap her in. Bobbie having gotten this far with Sue headed over to Tom‚Äôs pod to repeat the process. Jack stayed with Sue helping her move her arms in circular motions to slowly increase the blood flow through her body. In a few minutes Sue was in control and her old self.

Sue:				Jack, did you tell Tom you saw a ship explode while in cryo? 

Jack:		I did. It was really life-like too. But probably just a trick of the mind having been unconscious for so long.

Sue:		No. I saw it too. Except we were on board when it went up. Bobbie told me she also had a dream about it. Didn't she tell you?

Jack:		No. She didn't mention it. But you know it's probably just a coincidence.

Sue:		That's what I told her. But I'm beginning to doubt it. Could use some coffee.

Jack:				I don't think we've come across any of that in storage.

Sue:				Don't worry. Tom and I didn't either when we looked.

Jack:		Looks like Tom's pod is open. I should help her get him out of there. Will you be okay?

Sue:				I'm fine. Go and help Bobbie.

Narrator:		Jack left Sue on her own and went to give Bobbie a hand getting Tom from his pod. Bobbie had already talked him through the minor exercises that would help him reacclimatize to shipboard conditions. When Bobbie signaled, Jack helped her get Tom back to the pilot‚Äôs seat.

Sue:				Okay Tom. Arms out and make circles.

Narrator:		Tom complied and became more aware of where he was. He was no longer on the deck of a foreign ship but back on the Jupiter. There had been no explosion, he and everyone else were safe aboard the Jupiter.

Tom (gasping):	Jack, I saw it. It was hundreds of feet long. I can almost remember the name on the hull. It started with an S followed by an A.

Bobbie:		What is going on here? I'm not superstitious but we all had a dream about an exploding ship? How is that coincidence?

Tom:		You two dreamed about it too? I remember Jack told me he had but I didn't know you had too, Bobbie.

Sue:		And me. Seems we all had this dream or at least part of it. Considering how unlikely this is we should probably just get back to work and forget about it.

Tom:		Probably a good idea. Jack, you want to call Houston? Let them know our current situation. I'll call tomorrow when I officially take back over, with Sue's blessing of course.

Sue:		I should start on the treadmill. Bobbie, you want to help me and keep the readings chart on my progress?

Bobbie:			Sure.

(Short radio static)

Jack:				Houston this is Jupiter, come in.

Control:			Jupiter this is Houston.

Jack:		The sleepers have awakened. Have four active crew members again. We're on course and fuel is down to point three seven five of maximum. Oh, and someone tell the lab crew that the clover is doing fine. Looking forward to more when we get settled. Nothing else to report. Jupiter out.

Control:			We read you. Houston out.

Tom:			Clover. What clover? Did I just miss something here?

Jack:				Come on back to the exam room and I'll show you.

Narrator:		Once in the exam room Jack pointed at his terrarium on the table. Tom bent over the table for a closer look. On the side of the terrarium, he read the name of the plant Jack had been growing. Trifolium had been listed on the side of the plastic box.

Tom:			Trifolium. Sounds too much like Triffid if you ask me.

Jack (laughing):	I'm pretty sure that these won't uproot themselves and start killing people. Good old clover, a honeybee‚Äôs delight.

Tom:			Surely these won't grow on Mars, will they?

Jack:		Maybe if they're kept in the greenhouse they sent with us. They weren't meant to be one of the plants I'd try to grow, Arctic wheat or Siberian potatoes. But I don't see any reason not to make a small place for it.

Tom:				This thing will have to be secured tomorrow. Don't want it 			flying around when we do our first orbit.

Jack:		Don't worry. I'll secure it tonight when I take my last readings.

Narrator:		Exiting the exam room took them right past the treadmill.

Sue:	Don't go too far Tom. It's your turn here in a minute.

Narrator:		Sue slowed her walking pace until she stopped the treadmill. Bobbie logged Sue's stats on the readings inventory log and then helped Sue get unbuckled from the machine. Tom, a little begrudgingly, took her spot and Sue took the clipboard from Bobbie to record Tom's stats. Bobbie went forward with Jack towards the console. They both look out the ship‚Äôs forward screen.

Jack:	You know we should be able to see it with our naked eyes. Technically you can see it from Earth too but I imagine we'll get a much better view.

Bobbie:	I bet that's it in the bottom right of the screen. I wonder what it will look like tomorrow?

Jack:	Much closer I would imagine.

Bobbie:	Ha ha. I know that. We'll be the first ones to see it fully with just our eyes. I'm excited. We‚Äôre almost there! After eight months we're almost there!

(writing sounds on paper)

Sue:	A little longer, Tom. After that I am definitely brushing my teeth. Now I know how they felt when they came out of the pods.

Tom:	I agree. Soon as I'm off this thing. Speaking of which, how much longer before I can get off this thing?

Narrator:		Sue looked at the treadmill‚Äôs readout and made a final note on her clipboard.

Sue:	You can stop now.

Jack:	I guess we have to give up the books and the music now Bobbie.

Bobbie:	This close to our destination who needs them? I'm not sure I could relax now even if I wanted to.

(sound of chair adjusting)

Jack:	We should though. Just kick back and relax. You know as a kid I used to believe that the sooner you went to sleep the quicker tomorrow would come.

Bobbie:	Seems reasonable. If you're six, that is.

(sound of footsteps)

Tom:	What's new? 

Jack:	Not much. We‚Äôre almost to our destination and everything seems to be going well. Everything's still on automatic. No excitement around here till tomorrow.

Tom:	Good. Not sure that the effects from that cryo-bed are wearing off. Still feel massively tired. You'd think after four straight months asleep I‚Äôd be wide awake.

(sound of footsteps approaching)

Sue:	No. Just the opposite I'm afraid. It'll take at least twenty-four hours to get completely over the side effects.

Tom:	We may be glad that our first orbit tomorrow is on auto-pilot. Can't we do anything to get this to wear off faster?

Sue:	Yes. If you take it easy, more time on the treadmill will help out but you'll need to do it in half hour intervals. Half hour walking and at least half an hour off in between. We have plenty of time till it's officially tomorrow.

Tom:	I think I'll go ahead and take some more time on the treadmill.

(sound of footsteps walking away)

Jack:	You know I still have a plant I have to secure back in the exam room. I was going to wait but I think I'll get to it now.

(sound of footsteps walking away)	

Bobbie:	Well that just leaves the two of us. By the way, thanks for sharing your music library. Probably would have been tearing my hair out otherwise.

Sue (yawning):	That's alright. If it wasn't for you wiring the power for this thing it would have been completely useless. You know I think I better alternate with Tom on that treadmill.

Narrator:		Bobbie sat back and let her mind wander for a little while.

Bobbie (thinking to herself):

Tonight would be a good time to call Samantha. Don't know when I'll get another chance before we land. But still have to wait until ten p.m. Wisconsin time.

 (Sound of Jack returning and sitting down)

Bobbie:			You know if either one of us was smart we'd be taking turns 		on that treadmill. I know we hit it once a day but today 			might just be a good time to get some extra walking in.

Narrator:		Bobbie stands up and goes to the console. Once there she plugs Sue's cassette player into the overhead address system. That done she heads over toSue and Tom at the treadmill. Not one to be left out of the action, Jack joins them.

For hours they take turns on the treadmill; Sue and Tom to become more awake and Bobbie and Jack to become more relaxed. Eventually their legs grow tired and they break for a late dinner rummaging around in the food stores for something they disliked the least. The idea to look for something they liked the most didn't occur to them. Still, this was a small price to pay for being the first people on Mars and they all accepted it.

After dinner Tom and Jack went over the console readings, Sue inventoried her medicines and Bobbie called Samantha.

Bobbie:			How's it going Sam?

Samantha:		Great. How far away are you now?

Bobbie:		Well, we‚Äôre about fifty million miles away right now. That's 	why there's a lag between the time you ask me something 	and I respond. I have to wait close to three minutes to hear you then you have to wait three minutes to hear me. While neither of us are talking all you'll receive is static like I'm no longer there. I know it wasn't as noticeable when I called you before but we are quite a bit further away than we were last time we talked.

Samantha:	I bet none of my friends talked to anyone that far away before.

Bobbie:	Well remember you can't tell anyone about this or I might lose my job. You wouldn't want that to happen to your Aunt Bobbie, would you?

Samantha (forlornly):	No. I guess not.

Bobbie:	Good. We start to orbit tomorrow so I won't be able to talk to you until after we land. It might be a couple of days before we speak but keep monitoring this frequency. Love you. W0TJ out.

Narrator:		Bobbie secured her mic and headed towards storage. When 	she returns, she has a bundle of emergency thermal 		blankets that were to be used at night on the planet to augment the ship‚Äôs heating. Bobbie begins disconnecting the radio from the floor than wraps the blankets around her radio.

Jack:				What are you doing?

Bobbie:		Preparing this thing for landing as best I can. Just in case we bounce.

Jack:	Well, isn't that a morale builder?

Bobbie:	I didn't say we were going to bounce.

Tom:	You know I would like to be able to say I didn't know about that thing being on board. Anyway, that's what I'd like to be able to say. We have a lot going on in the morning. If you can get sleep, get sleep.

Narrator:		Four people that were about to make history tried to sleep. With only a few missteps the journey had been a success. However, the real work of the mission was about to begin.

Ride of the Valkyries took no one by surprise as it blared over the address system eight hours later. Looking out the front view screen they see a large crimson red planet. They were the first in history to see the planet this detailed with a naked eye. To actually land, they needed to slow down and to do that they had to orbit the planet and gradually reduce speed. The Jupiter's computers were preprogrammed to control both orbiting and landing without need of human intervention.

Tom:			Houston this is Jupiter. Over. (radio static)

Control:			Jupiter this is Houston. 

Tom:		We are shifting trajectory. Computer control good. Jupiter is about to perform its first retro burn in ten minutes. Expect to lose contact with you as we go dark. Will make contact again when we come to the daylight. Over.

Control:	Very good Jupiter. This should fix your first orbit at five degrees above optimum. We'll correct that with second orbit.

Tom:	About to go dark. Jupiter out.

Control:	Houston out.

Tom:	Okay Jack, keep an eye on that display. We need to double check when those retros fire and for how long. Then check adjusted speed.

Jack:	Should be coming up to ten second burn in three...two...one. Burn initiated. Burn finish in five...four...three...two‚Ä¶retro burn complete. Speed reduction...minimum.

(Tom makes notes on his clipboard)

Tom:	Retro burn again.

Jack:	Retro burn initiated. Ten second burn. Seems like she's handling herself so far. Burn finish...speed reduction five thousand.

Tom:	So far that measures up to what was expected. Initiating ten second retro burn.

Jack:	Retro burn initiated. Ten second burn complete. Speed reduction seven thousand.

Tom:	Houston this is Jupiter. Over. (radio static)

Control:	Jupiter this is Houston. Go ahead.

Tom:	Preparing for daylight burns. Hold on a second Houston. 

(slight pause)

Tom:	We have something large indicated on our radar directly ahead of us. About to hit our second daylight burn. Holy shit! What is that thing? Houston, I see it. I don't believe it! It's a ship! It's huge!

1o51r37,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiboSuccessStories/comments/1o51r37/hydrogen_sibo_gone_waterweight_loss_after_1_round/,Hydrogen SIBO gone + water-weight loss after 1 round of Rifaximin,"Hi ya'll!

About 8 months ago I was on these SIBO threads desperately looking for answers to my gut issues, so I wanted to add my experience here.

I gained a lot of weight in like 1 year by my own bad lifestyle and food choices, so I wasn't super surprised at getting SIBO when I finally learned what SIBO was. I was eating a lot of fat, processed foods, and not a lot of fiber.

After initially trying to get healthier on my own, I went to my PCP, complained of gut issues, and they referred me to a nurse at a Gastro office. I told the nurse about my bloating after every meal, painful gas, awful acid reflux, brain fog, COMPLETE inability to lose weight (no matter how little I ate or how much I worked out), and my wildly varying BM's (total constipation, painful BM's, or extreme urgency). For the record, I have had a history with sensitivity to wheat, have been on Zoloft for a couple years, and had gone off BC after 10 years on it the previous year, so I figured any of those could've been the culprit. No other serious issues like PCOS, IBS, etc.

She ordered a TON of tests, everything from food sensitivity to H. Pylori, and she also ordered the SIBO breath test but I stupidly saved that one for last because it was $300 out of pocket. Welp, everything came back totally fine and then when I got the results back from my SIBO breath test, it said I had Hydrogen-dominant SIBO (if I remember correctly my Hydrogen increased 45ppm during the duration of the test when the normal increase is < 20ppm).

I did a LOT of Reddit digging when I found out I had Hydrogen-dominant SIBO and I remember feeling so discouraged seeing 1) people saying ""Hydrogen SIBO doesn't cause weight gain"" and 2) that SIBO almost never goes away without more Rifax rounds or intervention methods. Thankfully, in my experience, both of these points turned out to be false.

My Gastro ultimately slid me a two week course of Rifax for free (although I know that you can get it from Canadian/foreign pharmacies for MUCH cheaper) because I immediately cried when she said it would cost $2000 with my insurance.

At the end of the course of Rifax, they scheduled a colonoscopy just to be on the safe side to see how my gut was looking. Everything looked completely normal, except for some inflammation near the opening of my small intestine, which they said could be caused directly by SIBO or its underlying cause(s).

To help resolve the inflammation, my nurse put me on Omeprazole nightly for 1 month, then every other night for 1 month, then switched to Famotidine nightly for 1 month, then slowly taper off entirely over the course of a month. She said this was important because if you go off these cold-turkey it can cause withdrawal in your gastro system and wreak havoc or the return of symptoms.

**And then, within 6 weeks of finishing the two-week course of Rifaximin, I lost 25 lbs of water weight.**

Yup, you read that right! Aside from going back to eating less bread (because I KNEW it upset my stomach), the nurse wanted me to keep my diet relatively normal, just healthier, to see if the SIBO would stay gone OR if I would need to try a more elemental diet. She also warned me against taking pre/pro-biotics or other motility agents and letting my gut try to re-balance itself first.

I read a lot Reddit threads about how lack of motility caused people's SIBO and the wild regimens they had to go through to correct it, AND so many people said to avoid fiber like the plague after finishing Rifax. I was lucky enough that I was just very conscious of what I ate and when and how it made me feel, and that seemed to work for me (thank God for my food journal!).

Primarily, what I did (and still do) is avoid bread and sugar and alcohol as much as feasibly possible, and I eat fiber, fat, and protein with EVERY meal -- when I did this I didn't need to snack as much at all, which I know a lot of people say also makes SIBO return because it doesn't give your gut a break, so it was a win-win. 

FYI: The reason I went right back into fiber was to solidify my BM's because I noticed that what had happened before was I had to go RIGHT after eating (every time), which made my nurse think that MAYBE my digestive system was rushing food out too quickly sometimes (which apparently can happen when there's inflammation near the small intestine) and then hoarding it for nutrients other times (which was causing fermentation and dysbiosis). So we actually wanted to try slowing things down and creating GOOD (not-stagnant) movement first.

I had a cheap small treadmill from Amazon and started walking (slowly) for 20 mins after each meal, in addition to not drinking coffee on an empty stomach and NOT holding in a BM (because you're busy or whatever else). When I taught my body that I will GO when it wants to GO it was life-changing and also stopped it all from sitting and fermenting in my gut for longer than necessary.

I also stopped eating close to bedtime and try to always sleep on my left side, which is best for digestion (especially if you get acid reflux) -- I have noticed a HUGE difference in my acid reflux doing this and almost never have heartburn anymore.

And not for nothing, fasting (i.e. the ""Fast Like A Girl"" book) has been extremely helpful -- I realized I felt amazing after my colonoscopy and that's when I started looking into fasts -- first 10 hours, then 12, then 18, and I haven't gotten much further than that but I stick to once per week and NEVER during the week of my period. It has immensely helped with gut health AND weight loss.

And finally, electrolytes. I do think a part of why my digestion was messed up (and why I had acid reflux) was because I was constantly hydrating with regular filtered water. I didn't know that (#1) it can churn up your food and cause reflux if you drink too much around mealtimes and weaken stomach acid and (#2) I was flushing out a lot of good vitamins and minerals and can feel a HUGE difference in my body now that I'm incorporating electrolytes daily.

Now it's 5 months later and I keep slowly losing weight (like a pound or two per month) and I actually almost never have gas or acid reflux unless I eat something super fatty or processed -- I never realized how little gas you can have when your gut isn't constantly fermenting things the way it was before! Like sometimes I have DAYS where I think ""I can't remember the last time I farted"" lol. But I'm sticking with what I've been doing because my goal is to get down to 165 lbs -- I was 200 to start and am now around 170-173 lbs.

And best of all, I'm on zero meds or motility agents for digestion. The only things I take are a psillium husk supp or tums on occasion as needed.

I wish I could go back and tell myself that everyone's SIBO journey looks different and to take what people say with a grain of salt. I am VERY lucky that I was one-and-done with the Rifax and that the underlying issue was my own crappy eating/lifestyle and nothing more sinister -- it sounds obvious now but when your gut is wreaking havoc on your life like that, you don't know if you've caused irreparable damage or discovered a new/horrifying issue. I truly can't imagine what that must be like for others, but I wish I would've just told myself ""I'll cross that bridge when I get there"" versus stressing myself TF out for weeks.

And if you needed the encouragement that resolving Hydrogen SIBO \*can\* lead to significant weight-loss, here it is!

Just take it one step at a time and try to get to know your body more and more, little by little.

Finally, the right nurse/doctor who ACTUALLY believes your experiences/symptoms is worth their weight in gold.",1,1760305554.0,SiboSuccessStories,0,1.0,False

1o51r2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1o51r2n/roommate_wants_me_to_contribute_more_to_apartment/,Roommate wants me to contribute more to apartment,"I could totally be being unreasonable/cheap but I feel like my roommate is overstepping some boundaries. She lived here for a year with a different roommate before I moved in. After we agreed to live together she sent me a list of items she wanted me to replace that the old roommate would be taking with her (fan, bath mat, trash can, etc.) I thought this was reasonable for me to contribute essential things to the apartment. There was some red flags going off when she wanted me to buy things that I wouldn't use like a blender or coffee maker. I did not buy those things after I explained that I don't use them and I thought we were fine.

Fast forward to today she asked me to order some spoons and an organizer for the silverware. I said sure and that I would add them to our app that we use to split costs for disposables (toilet paper, paper towels, etc) She said I can just buy them myself and I can keep them after we move out. This led to an argument about how I did not contribute much to the apartment and she feels that she contributed 80% of the communal stuff we have. She said that I'm cheap and making the situation uncomfortable. I don't agree with this and I got offended that she feels like I don't pull my weight basically. Her argument was that she bought a lot of stuff that was already here when I moved in but I don't see how that's my issue. I never asked her to buy any of it so I don't get why she is holding this against me. I also am just taking her word for it because I don't have any proof that she paid for it. Maybe the old roommate bought it? I ended up buying the stuff she asked for to keep the peace but the whole situation rubbed me the wrong way.

I told her this hurt my feelings and she apologized but she disagrees and still thinks she contributed way more and that she just didn't want to say anything before to start a fight. I'm still bothered by this and feel like she has requested a lot of things that we don't need and she was living fine without them before. She also has paid rent a few days late twice and I think she got offended when I reminded her to pay so this might have contributed to the fight. She apologized about paying rent late at least but it bothers me that she still thinks it's okay to tell me what to do with my money.

I have already decided that I won't be staying here after the lease is over but I want to keep the peace for the next 9 months. I really don't know if I'm being a bad roommate but I know I can be cheap at times. It makes me feel terrible getting yelled at in my own home over something so small. 

Again I could be totally in the wrong because sometimes I don't read situations well. I honestly don't know what to do and maybe we're both wrong. ",3,1760305554.0,badroommates,3,1.0,False

1o51p84,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeyondTheBumpUK/comments/1o51p84/nursery_posted_photos_of_my_son_on_instagram/,Nursery posted photos of my son on Instagram without consent üò¨,"So on Saturday morning my son‚Äôs nursery hosted a little coffee and baby meet-up ‚Äî the first one I‚Äôve actually gone to since he started in August (he‚Äôs just coming up to 17 months). When we first joined, we filled out all the usual forms including the one about social media consent, and we clearly ticked no photos.

Anyway, long story short, photos from the event went up on the nursery‚Äôs public Instagram which has nearly 700 followers and there were pictures of just my little boy in the carousel. As you can imagine, I was so shocked when I saw it on Saturday night. I felt upset, angry, all the emotions really.

No one mentioned what the photos would be used for ‚Äî the supervisor just took them, and I assumed they were for the private internal app we get updates on each day he‚Äôs there.

Just to be clear, this isn‚Äôt me judging any parents who are fine with their child being online ‚Äî totally respect that ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a personal choice for me and my husband to keep our son off social media. I also work in a school, so I know how big of a deal safeguarding and GDPR breaches can be.

I emailed the nursery manager straight away (see below), and I can see now that they have removed the photos, so the message was definitely seen. I really appreciate that it was dealt with quickly.

That said, I can‚Äôt help but feel a bit awkward now ‚Äî I get on really well with all the staff and his key worker, and I‚Äôd never want to be seen as that mum or have them talking about me behind the scenes. My husband thinks I should‚Äôve just politely asked for them to be taken down, but honestly, my emotions got the better of me. At the end of the day, if I can‚Äôt speak up for my little one, who will?


Email sent:

I am writing to raise a serious concern regarding the recent Instagram social media post following the baby coffee meet-up. Despite having clearly stated on the new starter form that we do not give consent for [child‚Äôs name] face to be shared on social media, multiple photos including him was posted publicly yesterday (please see attachments).

We are extremely upset and disappointed that our explicit wishes were not respected. This represents a clear breach of the consent agreement and of our trust in the nursery to uphold our family‚Äôs privacy preferences.

This incident constitutes a safeguarding breach and a breach of data protection under UK GDPR, as it involves the unauthorised publication of a child‚Äôs identifiable image without parental consent. Under both safeguarding and data protection obligations, the nursery has a duty to ensure all staff adhere strictly to consent permissions for every child before sharing any media online.

Given the public nature of your social media page, this poses a significant safeguarding concern. Children‚Äôs images being visible to hundreds of strangers online increases the risk of misuse, particularly in light of the growing exploitation of images and AI-generated content.

While I have already contacted the Instagram page via direct message to ask for the images containing [child‚Äôs name] face to be removed - I would appreciate confirmation that this has now been done, and reassurance that steps will be taken to prevent any recurrence, with appropriate internal review to make sure this does not happen again.

All staff members with access to the nursery‚Äôs social media page should be reminded to double-check parental consent lists before posting any content.

We really value the care that [child‚Äôs name] receives at the nursery, and I am sure this was a genuine mistake, but safeguarding and respecting parental consent must always remain a top priority. We want to ensure the right processes are in place to protect all children‚Äôs privacy and safety.

Many thanks for your understanding and for addressing this so promptly.

I'm looking at the community center and library pages, and it's all for seniors or little kids, nothing for people in their 20s.

But how else do you meet people?  I don't drink, but I guess I could go to a bar maybe?

I go to coffee shops a decent amount, but it wouldn't really be socially acceptable to approach anyone or to have anyone approach me.

It's hard to force situations where I'd interact with people like what I had in school.

Perhaps I should *start* a club?  Haha I'm barely able to get myself to attend one, much less take a leap like that

And in the off chance I find a social situation, I'm awkward as fuck, and I don't end up connecting with anyone and then I feel even worse.  I'd need positive practice experiences to build my skills and willingness to socialize, but the lack of skill prevents that from happening.

1o51cpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/cooperatives/comments/1o51cpe/solution_seeking_a_communication_tool_build_for/,Solution Seeking - A communication tool build for Coops,"Hey everyone,  
We‚Äôre the team at **Beanchain Coffee**, a worker-directed caf√© in Mesa, AZ, and over the past few years, we‚Äôve been developing something we think could help a lot more than just coffee shops.

It‚Äôs called the **Solution Seeking System (SSS),** a communication and leadership framework we built to make democracy actually *work* inside the workplace.

# What it is

The Solution Seeking System is a **3-step communication protocol** for resolving disagreements, improving relationships, and creating practical, measurable solutions. It‚Äôs built around a simple but powerful pattern:

1. **Introspection** ‚Äì Understand yourself first: your feelings, needs, and motivations.
2. **Mutual Understanding** ‚Äì Work to fully understand the other person‚Äôs perspective, and ensure they understand yours.
3. **Solution Seeking** ‚Äì Collaboratively develop actionable solutions that serve everyone involved.

It‚Äôs designed to replace reactive or adversarial conversations with structured, compassionate dialogue that leads to understanding and improvement. We use it daily at Beanchain to run meetings, give feedback, and handle interpersonal issues, but it‚Äôs flexible enough for any setting: friendships, families, community groups, or organizations.

# Why we built it

At Beanchain, our goal has always been to create a **worker-directed and eventually worker-owned cooperative,** a democratic business where every voice matters. But we found that democracy in the workplace isn‚Äôt just about voting or ownership. It‚Äôs about communication. Without good communication, democracy can‚Äôt function.

So we built the Solution Seeking System as a way to **bridge empathy and practicality** to make understanding, trust, and fairness not just values, but *repeatable processes*.

It‚Äôs grounded in what we call the **Wisdom Principles,** ethical tools like *Good Faith, Patience, Vulnerability, Bravery, Compassion,* and *Critical Thinking*. Together, they create a structure where people can disagree productively, stay kind, and still get things done.

# How it connects to our mission

Our broader mission is to **fight poverty and disempowerment through workplace democracy**.  
We believe that if workers have the tools to communicate and co-create systems together, they can reshape how their workplaces operate, building fairer, more resilient economies from the ground up.

In our experience, poverty isn‚Äôt just an issue of resources; it‚Äôs an issue of *structure and communication*. The SSS helps address those root causes by giving teams the skills to identify problems, design fair solutions, and implement them cooperatively.

# Try it yourself

We‚Äôve built two GPT tools to help anyone experiment with the system(the system and tools we make are free to use):

* [**Solution Seeking Guide**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68981adb38108191a91907d44138505d-solution-seeking-guide) ‚Äì Walks you through the system step-by-step to handle real-life situations and conflicts. Try describing the broad strokes of a situation to the tool and let it help you use the system to find a good path through it. 
* [**Solution Seeking Mentor**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6897eb5ac1d48191af7e78fefef86909-solution-seeking-mentor) ‚Äì Teaches the philosophy behind the system and how to apply its tools and principles. Ask any questions you want to this one; it has the whole body of work loaded up so it can help guide you through it in a meaningful way. 

You can describe a scenario, whether it‚Äôs a work issue, relationship conflict, or something else, and the GPT will help guide you through the process of introspection, mutual understanding, and solution seeking.

# We‚Äôd love your feedback

We‚Äôre still refining this framework, and we‚Äôd love to hear from people outside our own walls.

* Does this kind of structured communication system make sense to you?
* How do you think it compares to other frameworks like Nonviolent Communication or Crucial Conversations?
* What parts feel useful or overly idealistic?

You can read more about us on our website: [www.bchain.coffee](https://www.bchain.coffee)

If you try the GPTs, please let us know how they worked for you, what helped, what didn‚Äôt, and what kind of resources you‚Äôd like to see next.

1o5183u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1o5183u/aita_for_cutting_off_my_best_friend_after_finding/,AITA for cutting off my best friend after finding a secret group chat about me on her phone?,"Hi Charlotte, I made this one for you to share and put it up for you. I'm a big fan and watch all your videos. So let's get into it!

 I‚Äôm J (33M), and I recently ended an 8-year friendship with someone I considered my best friend ‚Äî let‚Äôs call her Sally (30F). Some mutual friends think I overreacted, so I‚Äôm hoping for an outside perspective.

Sally and I met years ago through mutual friends, and we hit it off immediately. We‚Äôve seen each other through a lot ‚Äî breakups, family drama, career changes. I was the kind of friend who‚Äôd drop what I was doing if she needed to talk, pick her up when her car broke down, help her move, you name it. I genuinely thought we had the kind of friendship that could withstand anything.

Recently, though, I started noticing little things that made me feel uneasy ‚Äî small comments or jokes that felt slightly off, like subtle digs disguised as humor. I brushed it off at the time because everyone jokes with their friends, right? But looking back, I can see how the signs were there.

Last week, I went to Sally‚Äôs apartment so we could grab lunch and hang out. Everything seemed totally normal ‚Äî she was her usual chatty self, asking about work, plans, etc. While she was in the bathroom getting ready, her phone (which was sitting on the coffee table) kept lighting up with notifications. I wasn‚Äôt snooping, but one of the messages caught my eye because the group chat‚Äôs name had my **name** in it. Naturally, that made me pause.

The chat title was my name ‚Äî followed by a picture of me with a big red X drawn across my face. The title?  
**‚ÄúBig A\*\*hole""**

At first, I genuinely thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. But then a few message previews popped up:

>

I didn‚Äôt open it, but that was enough. My stomach dropped. My hands were literally shaking. I felt like someone had punched me in the chest ‚Äî that hot, sick feeling when you realize the person you trust most has been mocking you behind your back.

I sat there in silence until she came back, pretending everything was fine. I told her something had come up and that I had to leave. She looked a little confused but didn‚Äôt press.

Later that night, after a few hours of trying to process what I saw, I texted her. I said, ‚ÄúHey, I saw the group chat on your phone. I don‚Äôt know what I did to deserve that, but I don‚Äôt see a reason to stay friends with someone who disrespects me like that.‚Äù Then I blocked her on everything. No argument, no dramatic confrontation. I just‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt do it.

A couple of days later, I started hearing from mutual friends. Apparently, Sally told people I ‚Äúoverreacted‚Äù and that it was ‚Äújust a joke‚Äù between her and a few others ‚Äî something I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt supposed to take seriously.‚Äù One person even told me she said the chat was just a ‚Äúventing space‚Äù because I can be ‚Äútoo sensitive.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse ‚Äî the fact that she made the chat or that she‚Äôs now trying to downplay it instead of owning up to it.

What really stings is that I haven‚Äôt gotten a single apology. Not even a halfhearted ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if that hurt you.‚Äù She‚Äôs just been acting like nothing happened, posting memes and selfies like her world didn‚Äôt just implode mine.

The mutual friends who keep telling me I should‚Äôve ‚Äútalked it out‚Äù weren‚Äôt the ones being mocked. They didn‚Äôt see their own face crossed out with insults attached. They keep saying, ‚ÄúIt was probably just banter‚Äù ‚Äî but I can‚Äôt imagine creating a group chat about someone I care about and calling it anything other than cruel.

I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôve never been two-faced with her. I don‚Äôt think I owe her a chance to justify something that deliberate.

So, Reddit ‚Äî was I too harsh for cutting her off immediately? Should I have given her the chance to explain? Or was I right to walk away without giving her the satisfaction of spinning the story?

Because right now, I‚Äôm just sad and disappointed. It‚Äôs not even anger anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs realizing that the friendship I thought I had probably never existed the way I believed it did.

**UPDATE:**

Wow, I didn‚Äôt expect so many responses. Thanks to everyone who took the time to comment ‚Äî I‚Äôve read through most of them, and it‚Äôs helped me more than I thought it would.

A few people asked if Sally ever reached out after I blocked her. She actually did ‚Äî kind of. About a week later, she sent a long email (which I only saw because it went to my work address). The gist of it was:

* She said the group chat was ‚Äúa dumb joke that got out of hand.‚Äù
* Claimed that her friends ‚Äúmade it worse than it was.‚Äù
* Said she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt mean to hurt‚Äù me and ‚Äúwished I hadn‚Äôt taken it so personally.‚Äù

There was no genuine apology ‚Äî just a lot of minimizing. She never took accountability for the fact that she *made* the group chat, named it after me, and used my picture. Apparently, according to one mutual friend, the chat had been going on for months and had several people in it that I actually know. That stung the most ‚Äî realizing that some people I‚Äôd hung out with were in on it the whole time.

After that, I decided not to reply to her email. I realized nothing good would come from reopening that door. A few of our mutual friends have since admitted that they were uncomfortable with what she did, too, and a couple even distanced themselves from her after hearing the full story. Others still think I‚Äôm ‚Äúbeing dramatic,‚Äù but honestly? That‚Äôs fine.

I‚Äôve been taking a step back from that whole social circle and focusing on people who actually respect me. It‚Äôs been weird ‚Äî kind of lonely at times ‚Äî but also freeing. I don‚Äôt have to wonder what‚Äôs being said behind my back anymore.

If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs that when someone shows you who they are, *believe them the first time.*

So yeah ‚Äî I‚Äôm not angry anymore. Just done. And that feels a lot better than holding onto something fake.

**FINAL UPDATE:**

It‚Äôs been a few months since everything went down, and honestly, I‚Äôm in a much better place now. Cutting Sally off was hard at first ‚Äî not because I missed her specifically, but because losing someone who was such a big part of your daily life leaves a weird silence behind. For a while, I kept second-guessing myself, wondering if I should‚Äôve handled it differently or given her a chance to explain.

But with time and space, I‚Äôve realized I made the right call. The friends who stuck around have shown me what genuine respect and kindness look like. A few of them even told me that watching how calmly I handled the situation made them rethink some of their own boundaries. That meant a lot.

Sally hasn‚Äôt tried to contact me again, and I‚Äôm grateful for that. I don‚Äôt wish her any harm ‚Äî I just don‚Äôt want her in my life anymore. I think sometimes people outgrow each other, and other times, you simply see who someone really is and can‚Äôt unsee it.

Life feels quieter now, but also lighter. I‚Äôve been spending more time on my hobbies, reconnecting with old friends who actually value me, and realizing that peace is a lot better than proximity.

So, yeah ‚Äî I‚Äôm good. I‚Äôm moving forward. No hard feelings, just lessons learned.

Thanks again, Reddit, for helping me see things clearly when I was doubting myself.",2,1760304246.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,0.75,False

I personally don't think I do because I've been the way I am for about 15 years now since my early teens, but I just want to get some insight on this subreddit.

I've always been quiet and introverted, but as a child i was still social and was always with friends and had hobbies. Now as an adult i don't really have much of a personality, don't have any desire to socialise, no friends, no hobbies and very little interests. I have a good sense of humour though and can't say i feel lonely. But this is completely normal to me and I see nothing wrong with this, but im being told these things are a red flag that I have depression???

Apart from being very sensitive to criticism of any form, judgement or thinking I've annoyed someone (these things happen often but by no means everyday) I wouldn't say i feel sad or low mood THAT often?

My life is pretty dull, I work a cleaning job, previously corporate admin but found it too stressful. I have a 2 year old and a partner and as much as I love them I do find myself thinking if only I could have a do over in life. I don't feel like I really enjoy being a mother all that much and I've screamed in my daughters face over small things more times than I can count. 

I get irritated easily but have done for as long as I can remember. I get sensory overwhelm and sometimes I scratch myself intentionally to calm myself but idk why.
The main things I enjoy in life are sleeping, eating, drinking coffee and alcohol. Sometimes I force myself to keep drinking wine to make myself feel like shit on purpose but idk why I do it.

I think I'm on the spectrum but I dont fit enough of the criteria to be referred for a diagnosis. Even if I did have autism I'm pretty sure it would be too mild for anyone to be able to help or care anyway. I feel like that with my ""depression"" if that's what I have... like I'm at a borderline ""mild"" level where it's not really worth seeking any help. 

I've started seeing a counsellor but I already feel she's misunderstanding what im saying, she says what I feel is normal for a parent and is down playing it when I say I scream with rage at my toddler. I'm going to the doctor next week to discuss antidepressants because my partner wants me to but I think they won't have any effect, because like i mentioned above I dont feel sad?

I hope my ramblings make sense and thank you to anyone who can give a bit of insight into what I've written.",1,1760304209.0,depression_help,2,1.0,False

Setting ‚Äì International Space Station, Present Day

Characters ‚Äì Bobbie, Control, Jack, Narrator, Sue, Tom





Narrator:  	Aboard the International Space Station four new residents were settling in; Dr. Andrews, Bobbie Miles, Colonel Jackman, and Major Markham, better known to each other as simply Sue, Bobbie, Tom and Jack. 	

Sue is in her late twenties; tall, blonde hair, blue eyes.  A surgeon and general medical doctor who excelled in her studies, which, in turn, brought her to the attention of the National Aeronautical and Space Science Administration or NASSA. It was unusual to find someone of her skill and experience willing to forego social attachments for eighteen months of grueling training so she could spend nearly two years in the company of only three other people. Sue has an unusual liking for antiques and things she calls Steampunk; which were anachronistic technologies melding with the modern day.  NASSA allowed each astronaut to bring one item with them into space. Sue brought an old Walkman and ninety minutes of her favorite music on cassette.  

Bobbie is a brunette with girl-next-door good looks. Her parents nicknamed her Bob after a cartoon about someone that was constantly building things. Bobbie was a mechanical and electrical engineer already working for NASSA. It was said that if you could draw it Bobbie could build it. Fortunately, this will be a major advantage once the crew is on the surface of Mars and attempting to build a shelter.

Tom, although reaching the rank of Colonel at a relatively young age, considers himself as an average guy. He also considers himself anti-social whereas he prefers to have contact with as few people as possible. He prefers the company of machines over the company of humans. Machines are just so much easier to get along with. Tom thinks he might have received his eagle too early and sometimes wishes he hadn't received it at all. The new rank has taken him from his jet fighter to a desk frequently filled with paperwork. This mission will allow him once again to take flight.

Jack, like Tom, is also a pilot. However, he also is a meteorologist who flew his plane into the eyes of hurricanes to gather data for National Weather Service.  Because of his background NASSA considers him an ideal candidate for co-pilot and lead researcher. Jack is there to measure atmospheric conditions and take soil samples for experimentation to determine viability of possible plant growth on Mars.

The ship they will be taking is called the Jupiter, so determined by popular vote among NASSA enthusiasts. Over the last four proceeding months the newest space shuttles from SpaceZ Corporation were leased by NASSA to ferry large ship components into space. Once in space the shuttles unloaded their cargo by, and attached to, the ISS. Once done the crew of this ISS suited up and assembled the five large components together into the ship called Jupiter. This process was finished which triggered the arrival of its four crew to the ISS. 

Sue, Bobbie, Tom and Jack endeavored to get comfortable in their new quarters choosing to try and get rest while getting used to the gravity free environs of the space station.  Later on would be their first meal in zero-G consisting of a tube of what on earth would sound like a decent meal. Tubes like these would provide their only meals for nearly two years till they returned home. Home would be a long way away though. Eight months there, four months on the surface and then picked up to spend another eight months being ferried home. The Jupiter was not set up to return the crew back home. It carried too much in the way of food, supplies and shelter to have enough fuel to return home.

The Jupiter was not a large ship, measuring only fifteen feet across in the interior and one hundred and eighty feet in length. Its narrow width is due to restraints imposed by the width of the SpaceZ shuttle cargo bays that brought the individual parts of the Jupiter into space to be assembled near the ISS. Inside the somewhat cramped quarters could be found four cryogenic or ‚Äòcryo‚Äô pods. Two members of the crew would spend four months each in cryogenic sleep. Although the ship could pilot and navigate for itself it was determined that at least two crew should be awake to oversee ship maintenance during the flight.

The ship was divided into four sections. The control module where all flight coordination took place and where the cryo-pods were stored. Next came the medical exam room followed by storage and finally the engine bay. Down the long rectangular body of the ship were the long cylinders that made up the fuel cells. The body was to be used as a habitat after landing, which required the rectangular shape. Because it was already in space it didn't need to be extremely aerodynamic. Once the ship arrived it would orbit Mars twice then deploy parachutes and engage retro-rockets to slow the ship's descent to the surface. This will use at least half of the fuel carried, which is one of the reasons why there is no return via the Jupiter. Although its crew had spent six months training in the mockup of the Jupiter, tomorrow they would be on their way for real. 

Twelve hours passed and it was time to dawn their extra vehicular suits or E.V.A. suits for the spacewalk to the Jupiter. The plan was pretty simple. The crew would spacewalk tethered to a line currently being used to hold the Jupiter in space relative to the ISS. They would open the outer hatch to the forward airlock and would enter two at a time. The last two would release the tether near the hatch and enter the airlock. The crew of the ISS would release the remaining tethers leaving the Jupiter free to leave for Mars.

Setting ‚Äì Open Space, movement between ISS and the Jupiter

Narrator:  	Tom and Sue traversed the tether first. Each clipped a safety line from their suits and gave a short blast of compressed air propelling them slowly forward toward the Jupiter. When Tom and Sue were approximately at the halfway point Jack and Bobbie began following along the ship's tether. Once they reached the ship Tom activated a simple control panel that opened the outer hatch to allow access to the inner airlock. The hatch door slid open and Tom and Sue unclasped their safety tethers and stepped inside; the hatch door closing silently behind them. Bobbie and Jack soon arrived at the hatch.

Tom (thru spacesuit com):  

Bobbie, Jack, there's something wrong here. I can‚Äôt get the inner door open from inside and the airlock won't pressurize. One of you take a look at the panel outside the door.

Bobbie (thru spacesuit com):

I'll get it. Jack you're going to have to move away from the ship back down the line a little so I can pull this panel.

Narrator: 	After rotating the two locking handles Bobbie began pulling the toolless panel not knowing that Jack had not received her message. As she pulled on the panel it momentarily stuck causing her to pull it as hard as she could. As the panel came free the force propelled the control panel back behind Bobbie and into Jack, tearing his suit. 

Jack (thru spacesuit com):

Bobbie. I'm leaking air! Get that panel fixed quick.

Bobbie (thru spacesuit com):

Not finding anything. 

Jack (thru spacesuit com):

Tick, tick!

Bobbie (thru spacesuit com):

Got it.

Narrator:  	Jack saw the outer door open and unclipped his tether propelling himself into the airlock along with Bobbie. Once the outer door closed behind them Bobbie grabbed Jack to check for any damage other than the tear Jack held closed. Suddenly it dawned on her that the airlock was not pressurizing with air which meant Jack was in trouble of suffocating as the vacuum in the airlock continued to pull the air out of Jack's suit. Mercifully the airlock began to pressurize; within a minute the inner door opened and Bobbie shoved Jack through the opening as he fell to the floor. As quickly as she could she removed Jack's helmet and he began gasping for air. Three deep breaths later he began breathing normally again.

Setting ‚Äì Jupiter, immediately after entering

Sue:		Get him out of that spacesuit and get him back to the exam room.

Narrator:		Bobbie and Tom get Jack out of his suit and quickly out of their own. The doorway opening to the exam room would not allow for anything as cumbersome as an E.V.A. suit to pass. Tom gets one arm under Jack who could walk with a little assistance now. He helps Jack into the exam room and lays him on the table then leaves so Sue has room to work.

Sue:  		Let me hear that heart.

Narrator:		Having checked Jack's heart Sue took a light and tested his eyes for dilation. Jack's breathing had slowed down and his pulse was back to normal.

Sue:			He's ok. Jack, didn‚Äôt you hear Bobbie telling you to back up?

Jack:			No. Didn't hear anything. I wasn't even sure what she was doing. 

Sue:			What about Tom? Did you hear him?

Jack:			Something must be wrong with the suit. I didn't hear anything.

Sue:		I'll have Bobbie check it out. In the meantime, rest here for another five minutes. And I'll leave you alone. By the way congratulations are in order. You‚Äôre my first surviving space patient!

Jack:			What do you mean, surviving?

Narrator:		Sue smiled, stored her gear and went to the control module where Tom and Bobbie had just finished storing the suits.

Bobbie:		He is ok, isn't he?

Sue:		He'll be fine. He said his comm unit wasn't functioning. I told him I'd let you know.

Bobbie:  		That would explain why I could hear him but he couldn't hear me. I can patch the hole but not much I can do about the comm unit. 

Narrator:  	Tom took his seat in the captain's chair and looked at the outward monitor screens. The ISS crew was just finishing releasing the last of the mooring lines and the Jupiter was floating freely in space.

Tom:  		Jack?

Jack:  		Right here. 

Tom:  		Ok everybody buckle up and I‚Äôll call base to let them know we're ready to be on our way. This is Jupiter calling Houston control. Come in Houston control.

Control:  		This is Houston Control, come in.

Tom:  		We are set to proceed. Need to report a torn E.V.A. suit and trouble with the control module airlock. Other than that, all things are good to go.

Control:  		Ok Jupiter we need to get you safely away from the ISS. Prepare a five second retro burn. On my mark.

Tom:  		Copy that. Five second burn standing by.

Control:  		Jupiter you are go for burn.

Tom:  		Initiating burn, five, four, three, two, one. Burn complete.

Control: 		Jupiter, we have confirmation of attitude change from ISS. Once auto-pilot is engaged you are clear to ignite engines.

Tom:  		Houston auto-pilot engaged. Commencing ignition.

Control:  		God speed Jupiter.

Narrator:  	The engines ignite and the Jupiter is propelled forward while the crew are being pushed back in their seats. This burn would last twenty minutes and the Jupiter would level out at an estimated twenty-five thousand miles an hour. At that point a computer readout should tell them their approximate speed, position in space and determine if they are on course.

The crew would be able to fully move around the ship as well. Bobbie had created an ingenious design in the boots that would allow them to walk inside the Jupiter. The design was based on the operation of high-speed mag-lift trains. A sensor inside the boot would determine where pressure was occurring at and then turn on electromagnets in the base of the boot relative to that pressure. As the heel went down the electromagnets in the heel of the boot would activate. As pressure was applied near the ball of the foot the electromagnets in the heel would deactivate and the ones near the ball would activate. When standing still all the electromagnets activate.	

Setting - G-forces stabilize and everyone releases themselves from their seats

Tom:  		According to the readout we are on course and under automatic pilot. If everyone would gather around the exam table, I'd like to go over mission details before Jack and Bobbie go into cryo.

(sound of paper unrolling)

Tom:  	Yes, I know we have a paper map ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt use power. OK then, this is our landing destination. Arabia Terra, close to the equator. From readings taken there we can expect temperatures to be up to twenty Celsius during the day to minus seventy Celsius at night. Basically that's seventy degrees Fahrenheit to minus ninety degrees Fahrenheit.  Bobbie, you and Jack will have control of the ship as we approach Mars. Forty-eight hours before we reach our destination you are to revive Sue and I. Upon arrival we will orbit the equator twice slowing our speed before entering the atmosphere. Once there we deploy parachutes and extend landing struts. Just after the chutes deploy, we'll hit the retro rockets to further slow our descent.  Once we are down, we have to check the ship structure for damage. Bobbie of course that will be your first duty if we find any hull breaches. Jack, I think the rest is yours.

Jack:  		As soon as possible after the ship is secure, we need to manually extend the solar panels to help provide us power other than nuclear batteries. Once that is done, we need to setup the electrolysis station that will produce oxygen from the heavy carbon dioxide rich atmosphere. Then set up soil water extraction. Bobbie, I need your help unpacking and setting up the unit outside the ship. It's large and cumbersome but since Mars has only a third of Earths' gravity it should be fairly light. For every cubic foot of Mars soil that goes in we can extract two pints of water. Now the oxygen and water these will supply initially will only supplement what we brought with us. Eventually they'll be our main air and water source.  Bobbie, after that I will need your help in setting up the greenhouse. From there I can begin the plant and soil research.

Tom:  		Ok. I think that wraps it up. Bobbie, you and Jack get ready for the cryo-pods and we'll activate them for you and make sure you are good to go.

Bobbie:  		Sue how long will those batteries last in that device? What did you call it? A Walkman?

Sue:  		Probably only a couple of hours.

Bobbie:  		If you want, I think I can find a way to link that thing into the ships power so you don't have to worry about those batteries. Why didn't you bring a digital player? It would have held more music files and be easier on the batteries.

Sue:  		I don't think I can really explain it. I just seem to have an affinity for old gadgets.

Narrator:  	Sue handed over her Walkman and let Bobbie get to grips with producing a power supply for it out of what was available in ship stores. Soon Bobbie produced a set of wires and a power plug and started tearing apart one of the ships panels.

Sue:  		Tom, why didn't you bring something with you from home?

Tom:  		They said my barbecue grill weighed too much.

Sue:  		Yum, yum. Barbecued food in a tube, my favorite.

Jack: 		I wanted to bring a bottle of ketchup. Anything to make that stuff taste better. What did you bring Bobbie?

Bobbie:  		Wires, solder, welder. What more could a girl ask for? Oh, and by the way Tom, as soon as I connect this, your digital navigator will be way off.

Tom:  		What?!

Bobbie:  		Just kidding.

Tom:  		Thank God. Not the kind of humor I need on this flight.

Jack:  		Relax. You'll have four months of doing nothing but reading a screen display. Don't sweat it.

Bobbie:  		There. That should do it. This cord should be long enough to reach the co-pilot seat. Now time for a nice freezing pod to sleep in.

Jack:  		Well, see you in four months, I guess. Just letting everyone know ahead of time I may laugh like Dracula when you open this thing.

Narrator:  	Sue went to Jack's pod and checked that it was working properly. The pods were equipped with sensors and monitoring devices that let the pods display vital signs such as heart rate, blood oxygen level and internal temperature. Once she confirmed that the door was secure, she activated the pod from the control panel on its' outer face. Sue took her clipboard and marked the time and current measurements being displayed. She then checked on Bobbie.

Sue:  		Any famous last words?

Narrator:  	Sue laughed and closed the pod door. She initiated the pod‚Äôs cooling system, as she did for Jack, then monitored the processes taking notes on the pods' progress.  Sue would continue to monitor the pods in which Bobbie and Jack would spend the next four months of their lives.

Sue:  		So far, so good.

Tom: 		It looks good on this side too. Slight deviations but they're within one percent of what was predicted. Better give Houston a shout. Jupiter to Houston control, come in.

Control:  		This is Houston control. (radio sound and light static)

Tom:  		Houston, we have reached cruising speed. All systems check out within spec. We have two crew members in sleep mode. Will check in again in twenty-four hours. Jupiter out.

Interview with Frank O'Connor
By SketchFactor
Friday, April 25th, 2003, 11:45 AM

New Halo 2 information is coming... Next month's issue of OXM features an exclusive look at the game and what you can expect to see at this year's E3 show. From the awesome cover created by our own Mehve to the new tidbits of info, the anticipation level is extremely high.

We invited Mike Salmon, Editor in Chief, and Frank O'Connor, Executive Editor, to visit our humble home to see first hand what we've been up to. After some top secret debriefings and a little Halo 2 multiplayer (drool) we sent them away to work their magic.

Once the dust settled from an unfortunate encounter with our intoxicated and belligerent Webmaster, I sat down with Frank to get some insight into their visit.

Hey Frank, how's it goin!? Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and what it is you do?

I‚Äôm the Executive Editor of the Official Xbox Magazine, which means I do whatever I‚Äôm told by a cabal of evil unmatched in modern media. Mostly writing, assigning and editing articles. I‚Äôm in charge of news and features, but I get to do lots of other things to, as you‚Äôll hear more about later.

Do you guys really sit around and play games all day? Describe a typical day at the office for us.

We only play games (during the day) if we‚Äôre writing about them, or taking screenshots. A typical day involves me rolling in here around 8:30, finding a coffee, trawling the news websites and answering email. Then I start writing and editing and taking screenshots and on a typical day, a software company will show up and show us a new game.

The office is tiny, so there‚Äôs a lot of noise and huddle and interaction with the other staff.

What are your favorite and least favorite parts of the job?

Well my favorite parts are the parts anyone would love: Traveling, seeing new games, meeting strange and fragrant new people, making fun of them the moment they leave, and forwarding pictures of terrible things from the internet. Also, on quiet days, I like to make up particularly heart-wrenching emails about orphans with consumption.

I'm sure getting a behind-the-scenes glimpse at some of gaming's hottest titles is a blast. What is the most memorable game feature you've worked on? On the contrary, what game have you had to write about that you just couldn't stand?

Halo 2 is definitely up there. In large part because I was so looking forward to it. Many, many years ago however, I was invited to see Super Metroid on the SNES in Japan, and the game was demoed to me by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gumpei Yokoi! And it hadn‚Äôt even been announced. I nearly soiled myself, as you can imagine. Plus, I was younger and easier to impress.

I was lean and taut back then, like a tiger. Or maybe a young Tom Jones. The worst game? Wow. There have been so many. Games are like movies you know, MOST of them are mediocre, average or bad. But seeing a game early means you have to appreciate that it‚Äôs not finished, and that it could get better. Maybe the worst games to see are just genres that you could care less about. For me, Strategy (not realtime) and ‚ÄúBemani‚Äù or Dance Dance Revolution type games are high on my shit list.

Working for a game magazine seems like a really cool job. What advice would you give to any aspiring game writers out there?

Get a college degree in something useful, like English LANGUAGE (not lit) or Journalism. That said, there are plenty of people in the industry with totally useless degrees. But get one anyway, not only will it help you get a job, but you‚Äôll get paid more to start. For our line of work, a vast, working knowledge of games is a must. Oh and most people can‚Äôt write. Just like most people can‚Äôt draw. Luckily, a crack-team of editors will fix your shizzle, for nizzle.

There's a lot more that goes into a game magazine feature than just the words. Can you give us an idea of how everything comes together and the roles that your teammates play?

Halo 2 is a convenient example. There‚Äôs a lot of political drama before fingers ever hit keyboards. We call, we email, we beg and we plead. Nothing is handed to OXM on a platter. In fact, Microsoft is very careful about which magazine gets which exclusive. They argue internally about this stuff too.

Once the feature deal is secured, we start arguing about assets. ‚ÄúWe need a zillion screenshots and access to everyone on the team,‚Äù is usually our first request. That is filtered to Bungie as, ‚ÄúThey want a polaroid of Jones and some pizza when they get here.‚Äù

Then there‚Äôs a bunch of arguing and more deal-making to get sausage on the pizza. Meanwhile a whole other drama ‚Äì the cover illustration - is being played out between Bungie and our art director. A magazine cover is a pretty thing, but hamstrung by things like logos and barcodes and disc info. We had to work with Bungie to get an illustration that worked for both of us.

Then we (in this case, me and Mike Salmon, but Rees, Reyes and McCaffrey all pitch in) show up. They show us AMAZING SECRET AWESOMENESS THAT WE CAN NEVER WRITE ABOUT and the stuff we did write about. Then they kicked us out onto the rain-slicked streets of Seattle and we went back to our hotel and started writing furiously. Because of the E3 deadlines and timelines, we only had a couple of days to get this feature from conception to production. But it was all worthwhile. And to be honest, pretty typical.

One thing I would like our readers to know is that OXM is tiny. Seriously, some people think we have a staff of thousands and all we do is fly around the world eating foie gras and washing our butts with champagne. There are four writers, two art staff and a disc guy. We work super hard. Except me. I‚Äôve fixed it so I can loaf around taking credit for other people‚Äôs work, and basically flirting with PR chicks by Instant Messenger.

You were one of the first journalists in the world to get into Bungie Studios for an exclusive look at Halo 2 and the cool stuff being planned for E3. What was that like? Can you share the highlights of your visit with us?

The visit was stressful for everyone. The fact that I have an appalling case of Tourette‚Äôs Syndrome By Proxy probably made it harder. As I unleashed yet another stream of random profanity and nonsequeter obscenities, the Bungie guys just sat there smiling and nodding.

Seeing the game though. That was the highlight.

Can you give us a hint about some of the cool stuff you've put together for your article?

It‚Äôs really the story of how Bungie made this amazing E3 demo, without wasting a single resource. Almost everything you see at the show and in the feature, will make it either intact or in some form to the final game. So we look at new game features, new gameplay mechanics, we check out new aliens and vehicles and the thing I‚Äôm personally most excited about ‚Äì environments.

Most of the detail and flavor in the piece comes from talking to the guys who‚Äôre making the game. Sound guys, graphics guys, gameplay guys, programmers. They are all so passionate about making this more than a sequel. I say that a lot, because everyone working on a sequel says that. And then it‚Äôs the same game with different textures. I can guarantee you in the case of Halo 2 that simply isn‚Äôt true. It‚Äôs a quantum leap.

Since practically none of our readers have ever had a chance to visit the studio, was there anything you saw or learned about Bungie that the average fan might not be aware of?

They love their fans. Anyone who‚Äôs been to Bungie.net is aware of that, but until you see the office space, it‚Äôs hard to understand how much. They have as much office space devoted to community as we have to our entire editorial staff at OXM. Seriously. Also, they‚Äôre expanding into a bigger office space, so maybe they‚Äôre working on a new game...

Now that you've had a small taste of Halo 2 I'm sure the wait for the final release will be more painful than ever. What advice would you give to our fans to pass the time between now and then?

Play more Halo. Buy the Mac version when it comes out(I‚Äôm sure the PC version will be nice too) and get used to playing online this year. Don‚Äôt get too used to the mouse. I even suggest getting one of those USB adapters so you can play using an Xbox controller to keep it pure.

Of all the games you've had a chance to preview, how would yourate Halo 2 as far as the anticipation and expectations that surround it? What about Halo 2 are you most excited about?

It‚Äôs an 11. Out of 10, natch. People are breathlessly waiting for it. Once the PC and Mac version of the first game hit, you can expect a huge migration to the Xbox just for Halo 2. The aspect I‚Äôm most excited about is in the feature, and I‚Äôm not going to spoil the surprise, but it‚Äôs hardly a shocker to reveal that new graphics are exponentially better.

Do you guys still play Halo around the OXM offices? If so, do you have a favorite map or gametype?

Yes. Every single day. 5:30pm, Blood Gulch, CTF, all vehicles on, normal weapons, five flags, flags reset. It‚Äôs a work of art. It NEVER gets old. Oh and by the way, we CRUSH Microsoft at that game type every time we play ‚Äòem. Not Bungie, Microsoft, to clarify. They park all their shit in their own base so we can‚Äôt get in. It‚Äôs sad really. Then we pick them slowly apart until they lose it...

Just between us, who's the best Halo player around the OXM offices?

Everyone has his or her strengths. Fran is Ghost-Face-Killa. When you hear that Ghost, it‚Äôs already too late. Mike Salmon is a good all-rounder, New Guy Ryan is getting really good and even our art staff are kind of bitchin‚Äô. I‚Äôm very creative and will get my tank on the roof of your base for laffs, but hands down, the best player is Dave Rees. He can kill you from across the map with two pistol shots. I swear to god he‚Äôs cheating. Also he has this really, really irritating way of standing on ridges where he‚Äôs protected from splash damage.

Everyone hates him. His one weakness is his bad temper. If, god forbid, somebody actually kills him, he throws down his controller in a short-lived fit of pique. Dan Egger used to rock, but he came to visit recently and had either lost it completely, or was playing some kind of antique Halo stylee that doesn‚Äôt cut it in the modern world.

Anything else you'd like to share with the Bungie Fan Community?

Just that they should all pick up the next issue. It‚Äôs got some game in it called Halo 2. Should go on sale the week of E3 (some subscribers might even get it early!) and you should know that Bungie is taking good care of you. Set your faces to ‚Äústunned.‚Äù

Thanks for your time Frank! We'll be looking forward to checking out next month's issue of OXM when it hits the stands. Also, next time I promise we'll keep the Webmaster locked up. =)",1,1760303917.0,u_TyLandcan,0,1.0,False

It's actually a huge relief emotionally. I might have a glass of wine now and again in the future, but I'm taking an extended break and doing a detox. Wasn't drinking much the last few months, but what I did drink just made me feel crappy. Now I'm drinking 60+ ounces of water per day. Plus my coffee because I don't want to be in caffeine w/d yet, but I'll probably give that up soon. Eating pretty well. Sleeping better. But the headaches and body aches are insane. It's been a couple weeks.

I should be clear in saying that I don't think quitting alcohol and the headaches and body aches are related. I think I'm having a cascade of garbage things happen at once. When I'm PMSing or on my period, my peri symptoms are worse, and this month was bad. Nausea, headaches, dizziness, etc. I just felt like I was dying for a week. I started cramping early, started my period late, bled heavy for a few hours, then no more period. But the cramps and garbage feelings lasted a week. Now I'm still dealing with a headache, sore neck, body aches. And I had weird pain in my hips for a couple days.

This all started about 7 days after I got my flu and Covid shots. (I get them yearly and never have an issue.) Not sure if that has anything to do with it. 

Anyway, I'm just angry because it took me a long time to finally give up alcohol and I wish I felt better rather than worse. I do realize this is an investment in my future though. After reading all the posts in this sub, I know I might have a really rough time ahead of me, and I want to be as healthy as possible going in. I started meditating a few days ago.

I‚Äôve been working with a few coffee brands recently for their marketing, and something I‚Äôve noticed is how quickly the Indian home brewing community is growing. More people are exploring pour overs, Aeropress, Moka pots and grinders every year.

But one thing that stands out is how expensive the equipment tends to be. Even basic gear feels out of reach for many who want to get started or upgrade.

As someone observing this space from a marketing and consumer perspective, I‚Äôm curious to hear your views.

Do you see a gap for good quality brewing equipment at a more reasonable price in India?

BUT, this time it's different. Im makeing a fanfiction of my own! This post is kinda meant to tell you guys about it if your interested in it. Here's the concept.

Its been 3 years since DotD, Spyro and Cynder stayed with the guardians to have some piece and quiet. Then, Terrador asks them if they want to go to school for dragons. They agree and the adventure starts from there.

Its a very brief summary but i think its good for a start. Alongside they meet some new friends. This fic combines a ton of stuff conected to our favourite purple dragon and blends it in the Legend universe, which is why im posting this here. But it also includes stuff i found from other creators and writers too. Here are the characters they meet and how they will act.


Classic series:
Flame - this universes Vegeta but less stubborn and has an acual win to lose ratio, not just sh*t talk and get demolished every single fricking time.

Ember - Amy Rose from the Sonic franchise but her character arc isnt destroyed imidiatly after it starts.


Other fanfics/writers/artists:
Vale - Originaly from Pure Light, this Vale, full name Valerian, is not afraid to get in action but also likes avoiding it. He's the second big protagonist alongside Spyro for more then one reason.

Burner - also from Pure Light, lazy bum with a ton of potential, also not his acual name.

Elecjoy - also from Pure Light, anxiety personified and overdosed on coffee, not his real name, but a shorten version of it like Vale.

T.J. - Pure Light OG again, and outside of Cynder, the only sane dragon Spyro's age, also the rich kid.

Scarlet - her desgine is inspired by Schl4ffy's OC of the same name but the similaritys end there (it's Scarlett with an extra t), this dragoness uses her looks and skills to get everything she wants any way she can... until she cant anymore, whops!

Nero - this guy i saw a few times and he's always different, so here's my take on him, a shadow dragon who's got a big bone to pick with the purple dragon, and seem to care about Cynder more then he should, but why?


This fic is made in a style simmaler to Skylanders Academy, starts off episodic but after some time dips into serialized style for larger scale storys.
This fic will expand on the lore of the purple dragon, magic or mana and its elements, and will show that evil never sleeps, but neither do our heros no matter how much homework they might have.

You're free to ask any questions that you might want to know. Ill answer as many as i can, but wont guarante an answer since im still thinking of what to or not to include.

The fic is called ""Legendary Tails of the Academy"" and its first 4 chapters are available on AO3 and Fanfiction.net, my username is MiscFics. Hope to see you!
Also, this fic might not get updated often due to a) me haveing school and needing to study, and b) im not a good episodic writer but the stuff i wana write i can only write after a LONG while down the line.

Edit: I also made so that the characters are anthropromorfic, wear clothes and have TVs and Phones. I know not everyone might like this but a lot of stuff I wana write can only be told in this setting, sorry",4,1760303203.0,TheLegendOfSpyro,0,1.0,False

What‚Äôs interesting is that now I can clearly see why I didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend before. It wasn‚Äôt bad luck or timing; it was a lack of confidence. I used to be that guy who overthought every move, always waiting for the ‚Äúperfect moment‚Äù to approach someone, which, of course, never came.

So, I just went for it. We started talking, I made her laugh, and before leaving she gave me her Snapchat. A few days later we met up for coffee, and things just clicked naturally.

Finding Clay took years.

Nine of them, to be exact.

The cops said Kenny fell through a rotten floor in a condemned building. Said the stairs gave out and that we panicked. That was the story they wrote down. We never corrected it. Some truths aren‚Äôt made for paper.

After that night, they split us up. Clay was gone first. I stayed long enough to learn how to pack without looking back. Every new home felt like a waiting room.

I worked my way through quiet jobs, half-pay checks, and apartments that smelled like old paint. The guilt never left. It just changed shapes. Sometimes it was a sound in my dreams; sometimes it was silence in the middle of a crowded bus.

When I finally started searching for him, it wasn‚Äôt about friendship or reunion. It was survival. His name barely showed up online ‚Äî no social media, no address, just a mechanic shop in Indiana with C. Hill listed under staff. Same birthday. Same look in the grainy photo.

It was only one state away. I left that night.

The town felt like it had given up a long time ago. Brick buildings sagged inward. Storefronts stared back empty. His shop sat on the edge of it all ‚Äî a low concrete box surrounded by dead cars.

The front desk guy looked up from his magazine. ‚ÄúYou need something fixed?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for Clay Hill,‚Äù I said.

He hesitated. ‚ÄúYou family?‚Äù

‚ÄúOld friend.‚Äù

He pointed toward the garage bay. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs back there.‚Äù 

Clay came out wiping grease from his hands. The sight of me stopped him cold. His face drained of everything but confusion and something close to anger.

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúIsaac?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

He stood there a second too long, then turned and walked toward the back lot. ‚ÄúNot here,‚Äù he said.

I followed him outside. The air smelled like rust and cold metal. He lit a cigarette, shaking a little, though it might‚Äôve been the wind.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI had to find you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù His voice cracked halfway through the word. ‚ÄúWhat the hell do you want from me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ needed to see you. I needed to know you were still alive.‚Äù

He let out a hard laugh that didn‚Äôt sound like him. ‚ÄúAlive. Yeah. Barely. You showing up here‚Äî‚Äù He rubbed a hand over his face. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like you dragged that night out of the grave.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never buried it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen that‚Äôs your problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI buried it and I‚Äôm trying to keep it there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEvery night I see him falling. Every night it happens again. Don‚Äôt tell me you don‚Äôt think about it too.‚Äù

Clay stared off past the junk cars, eyes glassy. ‚ÄúYou think this is easy for me? I wake up sweating, gasping, sometimes hearing him. But I learned to shut it out. You should‚Äôve too.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt stay shut out forever.‚Äù

He flicked the cigarette into the gravel. ‚ÄúWhat do you want from me, Isaac?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going back,‚Äù I said quietly. ‚ÄúTo the building.‚Äù

He froze. His jaw worked like he was trying to chew the words before spitting them out. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out of your goddamn mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. But I can‚Äôt move on until I do.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you want me to what? Tag along? Relive every fucking second of that night?‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to stop pretending we didn‚Äôt leave him there,‚Äù I said. My voice cracked on the last word.

He looked at me like he hated me for saying it ‚Äî but hated himself more for knowing it was true.

‚ÄúGet out,‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúClay‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúGet out before I make you.‚Äù

I did. I checked into a motel off the highway. The kind with carpets that hum when you walk and curtains that smell like mildew. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. The heater made noises like someone breathing through the wall.

The next day was endless. I walked circles around the town, trying not to think about how quiet it was. I bought gas-station coffee that tasted like burnt dust and sat in the car until it went cold.

That night, rain came down hard. I sat by the window and watched the neon from the vacancy sign smear across the glass. I thought about how he looked when I said Kenny‚Äôs name ‚Äî like a wound reopening.

When my phone buzzed, it didn‚Äôt feel real.

‚ÄúFine. Ill fucking go.‚Äù

No punctuation. No explanation. Just that.

The next morning he was outside the shop when I pulled up. His duffel sat by his boots, and his eyes were red like he hadn‚Äôt slept either.

‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm doing this,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not for you. It‚Äôs for him. And when it‚Äôs done, we don‚Äôt talk again.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAs long as we do it.‚Äù

He nodded once, slow, then climbed in the passenger seat.

We didn‚Äôt speak for miles. The radio stayed off. Snow was starting to fall again ‚Äî the same thick, heavy kind from that night.

We stopped for gas outside Joliet. The station lights buzzed like insects. Clay went inside to grab food, and I sat on the curb beside the car, writing this.

Nine years later, and I‚Äôm still chasing the bottom of those stairs.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen next, but I do know one thing.

This could very well be a one way trip. ",44,1760303109.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

We hooked up about four days ago, and now we‚Äôre seeing where things go from here. It‚Äôs still early, but something about her feels different, like it‚Äôs not just another random connection.

What‚Äôs interesting is that now I can clearly see why I didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend before. It wasn‚Äôt bad luck or timing; it was a lack of confidence. I used to be that guy who overthought every move, always waiting for the ‚Äúperfect moment‚Äù to approach someone which, of course, never came.

This girl and I met about 10 days ago in a Starbucks. I remember standing in line and debating whether I should say something or not. A few months ago, I definitely wouldn‚Äôt have. But I‚Äôve been working on myself a lot lately both physically and mentally following some practical mindset and confidence exercises from a guide I‚Äôve been using, and I guess that gave me the push I needed.

So, I just went for it. We started talking, I made her laugh, and before leaving she gave me her Snapchat. A few days later we met up for coffee, and things just clicked naturally.

Now, for the first time, I feel like I‚Äôm actually ready for something real. I‚Äôm not trying to prove anything anymore I just want to see where this goes. It‚Äôs wild how once you fix what‚Äôs going on inside, everything else starts to fall into place.",2,1760303056.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1o50otb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o50otb/how_fucked_am_i/,How fucked am I?,"This person and I were dating from Jan 2025 to May 6th 2025. The reasons where simple: she was afraid of hurting me but felt like she was loosing feelings. Her days were getting harder and she saw me trying too hard to help her out, but in the end she felt like she was hurting me.
Me? Well, I should've communicated or tried but with this person. Harsher topics were hard to communicate - they would physically shutdown with stress and then would have an emotional breakdown.
We broke up. Went a month on contact. Then we both, on the same day, decided that we've had enough. We talked for 6 Horus about how hard the breakup was, and how weird it all felt.
She told me she couldn't confirm if she wanted to go back, but she would think about it during summer. I did ask if she still has a crush - she did.
The whole summer we did talk a bunch of times. Sometimes she'd go away, sometimes not. There were invitations made. The letters keto being written. The playlist kept going - all things she asked to keep ( and whilst I was on the ""idk phase"", it didn't feel wrong).
She did tell me her greatest fear was leading me on. That being said she did, in the same conversation, admit that maybe our breakup was a bit ""too dramatic"" from both.
She comes back. She brings 2 books for a project I'm doing - project that she actually didn't really like that I was doing, but decided to support me anyway.
She still talked to me but there was something in the air. Some stillness in her behavior. So we did go take a coffee. 
After a long conversation where she seemed very defensive, even looking back at things she adored from the relationship -like our little nicknames - with spite, shutting down any argument we had in our conversation about politics and friendships stuff...she was just too damned defensive about everything. I felt like the person I loved just...changed. 
Idk what to make of her now. 
The end of that conversation ended with her telling em that actually, that movie we both decided we'd like to watch together, won't be enjoyable to me. After asking if she felt nothing for me, she affirmed that yes, she doesn't feel anything for me. That she hated my first analysis of the situation before the summer was something she hated. That it was all her fault, said she was sorry but ""love is the base of all relationships. Love that isn't there"".
It was a hard pill to swallow after such a summer I've had. Just told her how special she was to me and what I learned and where I fucked up - things that I have said in the past. She told me that she would go back, if there was love. But there's no love here anymore.

I want to take her at face value. But this is so alien to me. This person wasn't like this.
She asked to keep writing letters in this last Convo. I said no. The playlist is still alive. after we broke up for the second time, she's been sending me either things she specifically knows I'd like or reels - the first one was on the day we broke up for the second time.
She wanted a respectable friendship - but where the fuck is respect here is beyond me. I did communicate I was going to need some time. 
(To her, a couple of hours).
She's inevitable in my life. We have classes in the same classroom in Uni. 
She's looked at me sometimes - every single time she either smiles very warmly (which she doesn't do to most) or looks worried.

I really want to take what she said at face value. But I feel like there's nothing I can do. I feel like I deserve a real honest talk about what happened but I don't think I'll ever get that. I wish I could move on but I love this person. She was my first relationship in my life. My first everything. And it's becoming very hard to let go.

What the fuck shoud I do?

I thought maybe just keeping an open stance, overlook the situation, focus on my little life that's full of issues and problems and wait - either until someone new pops into my eyes, or she breaks down these defenses and talks to me about whatever.

My responses to her have been nothing but distant but warm. Yet she went one week cold silent and I freaked out. So this is not something that has been very nice to me.
I hate being where I'm at. I love her a lot and I do believe if we just talked about shit and not jump the gun, maybe we'd still be together ( I know these thoughts won't help, but I want to be as sincere as possible).

By keeping this distance and living my life, um hoping she'll understand that this friendship ""isn't a fucking friendship"". That it's not okay that she keeps sending me reels with symbols from our relationship. That it's not okay that she's still actively liking insta stories of mine like nothing ever happened. 

But I dont want to hurt her. Nor want to fully let go. It's confusing.

I'm sorry guys. But do you think I'm fucked?",1,1760302962.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Soo.. we (or he..? I haven't much done with it, just dissociating a lot) learnt about full body possesion and we're doing it every week for around a couple hours (1-3 hours, sometimes, if we just can't cuz of time and other issues, we can do it only for like 30-40min, but that's rare) for like a second or 3th month now and I wanna start to switching with him periodically instead of possesion. I already know to dissociate REALLY well, like, I can fully dissociate from body that hard that I do not feel anything literally anything, and it only takes like 5-10min to do so. He wants to switch with me too but we both do not know how to do that stuff. We had tried like 5-6 methods (and 2 of them was made by me with hope that it will help). So.. I have 4 questions here

1. How we can start or even start to learning switching at least a little bit ?

2. How it feels ? Like, you do not feel body that well.. and.. that's all ? Do you feel wonderland as yours ? Do you literally start to living inside wonderland ? Or how ?

3. For now, I'm still in school (lyceum) that is like 80km from my house so I live in that lyceums dorm. Soo.. I live with 5 other guys \- how can I start possesing tricks in dorm ? Cuz, I live there for like 5 days straight and then only I go home for another 2 days \- so 2 days of learning such a hard topic in the entire week is bad, I think

4. Our brain do not really can handle 2 personalities with each other at the same time so when he's active \- I feel REALLY sleepy and I just can't think hard or at least think more than 5+5=10 \- it's really hard for me, it's like I haven't slept for like 27 hours straight (I have done that one time and it's bad and the effects are literally almost the same), and coffee do no help.. sooo.. Can I use that to help me switch with him, like, he will ""activate fully"" (just by talking with me for like a minute-two or so) and I will go a little bit in sleepy mode and he will be one whos fronting or so ? And, btw, I started forcing another tulpa with idea that he may help us (and we just wanted another tulpa, both of us) and he's only 1 month, can speak, do not really have autonomous but still, when he ""activates"" too, I feel that effects more, not that hard, but still. And when they're both ""activated"" \- It literally works just like sleeping pills or so",4,1760302959.0,Tulpas,6,1.0,False

1o50n36,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o50n36,30 years of eczema - Vega test + diet change has transformed my skin in 3 weeks,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve suffered with eczema literally since I was born, I‚Äôm now 30. Over the years I‚Äôve been through it all: daily steroid use for about 10 years, constant flare-ups, sleepless nights, and relying on strong antihistamines just to get some rest.

For the past few years I‚Äôve been on a mission to get to the root of it and finally clear my skin.

About 3 weeks ago, I had a Vega test (also called electrodermal testing or electroacupuncture according to Voll ‚Äî EAV), and honestly, it‚Äôs changed my life.

The test showed intolerances to: üëâ Gluten üëâ Dairy üëâ Apple üëâ Plum üëâ Pineapple üëâ Garlic üëâ Tomato üëâ Kiwi üëâ Eggs üëâ Orange üëâ Sugar üëâ Onion

I cut all of these out of my diet straight away. Within a few days, my skin started to calm down. I did use steroids for 2 days just to get on top of a flare-up, but since then, I haven‚Äôt needed them at all and my skin has stayed clear.

I‚Äôve been vegan for about 3 years, so the dietary changes weren‚Äôt too difficult to make.

At the same time, I‚Äôve also switched all my clothing to natural fabrics like cotton, linen, and bamboo. I only use natural, unscented soaps and keep my skincare routine as simple and gentle as possible. I genuinely think this has made a difference too my skin feels less irritated day to day.

I also started using ZOEc around the same time (it‚Äôs focused on improving your gut microbiome), and I believe that‚Äôs playing a role in the improvement as well.

For the first time in my life, I feel like I‚Äôve found something that actually works. I know Vega testing isn‚Äôt medically recognised, but for me, the results speak for themselves.

I‚Äôve put some picture of before an after below",11,1760302854.0,EczemaUK,4,1.0,False

1o50lng,https://www.reddit.com/r/Appliances/comments/1o50lng/advice_on_refrigerator/,Advice on Refrigerator,"We have a Kenmore branded, LG made refrigerator.

Its a french door model, and is currently leaking under the bottom of the crisper drawer (into the fridge), the ice maker doesn't dispense (still makes ice though.) And I hate pull out freezers. So I'm ready to just get rid of it.

Looking at a Fridgidaire Gallery, side by side. I think they're a good brand. We always had Whirlpool appliances, and the last set fridge I bought was a top freezer Samsung (for what its worth, its almost 10 years old and is still working great.) 

The layout of our kitchen is kinda terrible, the fridge basically opens into a counter. Samsung's hidden door handles are ideal, but Samsung. A top freezer would be better. But until we can remodel the kitchen to flip the pantry and fridge... well anyway. Needing one that has an ice maker, we use it a lot for sodas, water, and my morning coffee.

1o50knz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1o50knz/all_the_same/,All the same,"I call you my moon

even with the craters, the cigarette burns on its skin

a tired disco ball

hanging low over empty parking lots

throwing silver light across rusted cars and broken glass

You‚Äôre flawed, but you‚Äôre still the sky I pray to

and I don‚Äôt want a perfect moon

I just want yours





I call you my flowers

the kind that bloom in empty fields

wild and reckless

already dying the moment they open

The wind steals their perfume

time steals their color

but for a heartbeat, they are holy

And darling, even wilted

you‚Äôre still a cathedral to me

I call you my stars

so distant they hurt to look at

like neon motel signs flickering in the dark

half-broken but stubborn enough

to keep glowing anyway

The universe pulls you away from me

but devotion isn‚Äôt about distance

it‚Äôs about staying when nothing else does

Yes, I love you all the same

because love isn‚Äôt some glossy magazine cover

it isn‚Äôt diamonds or airbrushed dreams

It‚Äôs the lipstick stain on the rim of your coffee cup

the scratch on the record that makes the song skip

the whisper of your past clinging to me

like sent of rain on asphalt

Love is messy and unfinished

and that‚Äôs the only kind I believe in

The imperfections are what make us

like cracks in stained glass catching firelight

like highways lit only by the moon

I don‚Äôt want perfect;

I want tragic and tender

something that hurts and heals in the same breath

something that tastes like smoke and honey

And maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôll stay forever

in the ruins of your laughter

in the silence between your words

in the small midnight things nobody notices-

the way your shadow pools on the walls

the way your hands shake when u pretend they don't

the way world seems to tilt

just to keep you in my orbit

Because even broken

you‚Äôre still the most beautiful thing I‚Äôve ever seen

and I‚Äôd rather drown in your flaws

than breathe in someone else‚Äôs perfection",2,1760302697.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

1o50jtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1o50jtt/cafe_has_me_employed_as_a_contractor_but_i_am/,Cafe has me employed as a contractor but I am treated like an employee‚Ä¶ seeking legal advice,"I work as a barista for a small coffee company in my local area and I‚Äôm technically classed as a freelance contractor. My contract says I‚Äôm self-employed, so I don‚Äôt get sick pay or holiday pay.

However, in reality: I have no control over my shifts, I‚Äôm put on a rota by management. If I refuse a shift, I risk losing work. I can‚Äôt send anyone else to cover my shift. I use their equipment, and follow all company procedures.

From what I‚Äôve read, that sounds more like a ‚Äúworker‚Äù relationship under UK law, not genuine self-employment. If that‚Äôs right, I should be legally entitled to paid holiday leave and certain protections under the Working Time Regulations 1998 and Employment Rights Act 1996.

But I just wanted to ask: Does this sound like I‚Äôve been misclassified? Is the cafe breaking the law by not giving me holiday pay? What would be the best next steps to take?

I‚Äôm not trying to start drama with my employer, I just want to understand my rights and whether what they‚Äôre doing is legal. The job market is so awful as of right now I was happy to get offered a job and rushed into it without thinking about my rights.

Thanks in advance for any advice, especially from anyone who‚Äôs dealt with similar ‚Äúfreelancer‚Äù or ‚Äúcontractor‚Äù situations in hospitality.",19,1760302642.0,LegalAdviceUK,8,1.0,False

I live in a two bedroom house with a beautiful kitchen, lots of natural light, and large private patio.

My roommate is moving out and our lease is up May 1st, 2026. I love this house so much I couldn‚Äôt move out!

32M, work from home for a very low demand demanding tech company. I have a 1 year old cat Lewis, and open to other pets you may have. Patio is gated. 

Move in date is flexible as my roommate is being flexible to wait for me to find a new tenant. Ideally December 1st, some time in December or January.
 
Would prefer to chat, share photos of the space, see if you like it, and either meet for coffee if you‚Äôre already in LA or zoom a few times just to get to know each other to see if with both vibe before moving forward with anything!

1o50fis,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/1o50fis/delta_the_worst_deal_in_the_skies/,Delta -- The worst deal in the skies?,"

Diamond Medallion for 7 years straight here. I am an exclusive first class customer who pays for the fare. I rarely use upgrades because I want to guarantee my seat. 

So often these days, I find myself really stunned at Delta. I'm on a flight today that was 44 minutes late taking off, missed my connection, Delta app is down and internet worked 10% of the time. 

I also spent $1,100 to fly from PHX-ATL.....on an ancient 757. This price was $400-500 more than United and American. 

So why is an ancient 757 with bad internet worth $500 more than Americans A321 with working internet? My drink was served in a coffee cup....no glassware. Not even a nice looking plastic glass. So what am I paying for? 

Want to go to Europe or Asia? I hope you'll enjoy the ancient 767's and A330's with *atrocious* business class seats. They are old and pathetic. I cannot believe they have not redone these planes. They are 30+ years old. And here's the kicker....Delta is the most expensive domestic carrier overseas! By a mile! What am I paying for? JetBlue has stunning lie flats on their A321's and I can fly to Paris for $2000. Or London. The food is far better than Delta too. I can fly new jets on Air France, Turkish, TAP Air Portugal and many others for half the price as Delta. 

Skymiles? An abomination. Air France will sell me a business ticket LA-Paris or PHX-Paris, much less the east coast, for 60,000 miles. Delta? Fly on their dinosaur for 375,000 miles. Same route. And there are countless examples of that. I can fly emirates first for 150,000 miles. Why is NY-London 375,000 miles on a 35 year old A330? 

Delta.....what am I paying for? Why are you double the price with dinosaur airplanes and 1999 business class seat? 

My diamond status costs me $28,000 per year and I'm not getting much advantage for the money in 2025. United and American now get the other 2/3 of my business domestically. 

Delta has great customer service. But that's not worth double. It's not worth paying $7000 for 9 hours in a 20 year old business seat. Drinking from paper cups. 

I don't care who wants to defend Delta. This is a businessman giving Delta feedback. So they can be better. You're not a good value anymore. Fix it. Stop flying dinosaur airplanes. ",0,1760302362.0,delta,35,0.47,False

i have a $10 off coupon i could offer in exchange for the scents, or i'd be willing to pay a little bit for each as long as it isn't ridiculously priced (like please don't make me pay $15+ a scent...)! or like $10 coupon for one scent and $10 for the other scent. i also have extra (non-BAB bagged, just in a ziploc) coffee, pumpkin spice, abd birthday cake scents i would be willing to trade!

1o50ewz,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1o50ewz/boss_relies_on_me_too_much/,Boss relies on me too much,"I work at a small family-owned coffee shop with probably 5 total employees. The baristas work by themselves, with two shifts a day from 7-1 and 1-7, two baristas who work one each. I work the opening shift Monday-Friday. Pretty simple, easy job, and I like working there a lot and they always tell me how much they like me too and that they‚Äôre grateful I‚Äôm helping them out so much. 

However, one of the girls who worked the closing shift consistently moved out of the country for college, and they are struggling to find a replacement. Since she left, they have been asking me at least twice a week to work beyond my normal hours we agreed on, doubles, 9-5, or 7-3, which sometimes I am happy to do because I need the hours, and other times I don‚Äôt really want to but it feels like they need me to so I do it anyway. They are also begging me to find someone I know personally who has barista experience, a food handler‚Äôs license and ‚Äúis as awesome as‚Äù I am to work the closing shift. Everyone I know with these qualifications already has a barista job and like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know that many people ?? I don‚Äôt just have like an endless supply of baristas on speed dial. I try to tell them this and still they are constantly asking ME to find someone rather than just putting up an Indeed listing or something. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm getting sick of them constantly asking me to work more than the hours we agreed on and seemingly taking advantage of my willingness to work longer hours rather than just hiring someone else. I feel like they‚Äôre putting way too much pressure on me and this is still technically a part time job and I don‚Äôt like really give that much of a shit about the place. I like it, I don‚Äôt want it to go under or anything, but it‚Äôs not my whole life. I even said if they hire someone without experience *I* could train them and they won‚Äôt have to worry about it, but they won‚Äôt. 

The job market is awful right now and I don‚Äôt want to look for another job, I like this job, I just don‚Äôt really know how to tell them to stop putting so much pressure on me. Help? lol

TLDR: My boss is putting too much pressure on me and I want help telling her to stop.  ",2,1760302323.0,work,1,0.75,False
1o50dzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1o50dzv/i_need_advice/,I need advice,"
I‚Äôm 21 years old, and I hit a dark place in my life. Before my panic attack, I was deeply depressed and thinking about dark things. I let it all out and spoke about it, and a minute later the panic hit me. I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening‚Äîmy heart was pounding, my hands were numb, and fear took over.
Since then, nothing has felt the same. I‚Äôm on edge all the time, worrying that it will happen again. It drives me crazy, but I‚Äôve avoided medication because I fear the long-term effects. I just want to feel normal again.
I have a great job and I graduated college, yet I suffer in silence most days. Only a few people know, and my therapist knows everything. I‚Äôve cut nicotine, caffeine, and anything that speeds my heart, which has crushed my morale, though the anxiety has reduced somewhat.

Today at work, there were paramedics and ambulances for another employee, and that moment triggered my anxiety‚Äîsuddenly, out of nowhere. It‚Äôs manageable, but it‚Äôs incredibly hard. I used to think people with anxiety just needed to ‚Äúlock in,‚Äù but my body doesn‚Äôt listen to me sometimes, and that‚Äôs painful.

I‚Äôm an officer in the military and a supervisor at my job, and I want to get better. I‚Äôm exhausted and my morale is at an all-time low, but I‚Äôm making progress. I don‚Äôt see an end, though. A mentor told me that leadership isn‚Äôt about the challenges you face, but about how you fight through them and still lead‚Äîand I‚Äôve clung to those words.

I want to enjoy coffee again, and I want to have a drink with my friends, but I feel chained by this. I can drive now without severe anxiety and I can work, but it still appears in waves and triggers. My morale is at its lowest it‚Äôs ever been. Please tell me if all my efforts will be in vain and if I‚Äôll deal with this forever.",1,1760302264.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

Hello, everyone! I have just arrived in Prague for my Erasmus exchange. I am 24 years old and am finishing my degree in Economics, Finance and Management.

I have experience in hospitality and catering, but that doesn't mean I'm only interested in that sector. I'm passionate about creating businesses, I have lots of ideas, vision and ambition, and I want to connect with people who share that mindset.

I'm not from Prague, so I'm looking for people who want to move forward, be entrepreneurial, share ideas and grow together.

After finishing my studies, I want to stay here and build something of my own, achieve financial freedom and real success.

I'm not looking for a large group; a real connection and the same energy is enough for me.

If this resonates with you, write to me. We could have a coffee, chat and see what comes up. ‚òï",0,1760301729.0,Prague,3,0.14,False

I had it organized in table format (Roaster	Name	Producer	Origin	Varietal	Process	Tasting Notes). If I tried to feed it too many in one go it would hallucinate but with 1 image at a time with a maximum of 9 bags it would do a terrific job including crappy pictures. 

Fast forward to today... I can't get it not to invent complete random Tasting notes, varietals and other info. It'll give credible information, that's the worst part but it'll be completely inaccurate. It won't even mix up information from multiple bags, it'll generate it out of thin air. No matter how many times I argue with it, it remains convinced I'm the one hallucinating. I had done over 130 bags previously without much issues (again when feeding it 1 image at a time), now I can't get any right, regardless of it being GPT5, Gemini 2.5 or CLaude sonnet 4.5  Any thoughts on what is going on ?

Up until now, I‚Äôve been grinding on setting 3 with an 18g dose, and extraction was fine. This morning, I decided to spray the beans with a little water before grinding. After that, the extraction became suddenly much faster, even though I didn‚Äôt change the grind settings, the dose, and it‚Äôs the same coffee beans bag.

I tried:

Cleaning the grinder

Stopping the bean spraying after that single try


‚Ä¶but nothing helped. The pressure gauge is now under the optimal range. I also tried:

Grinding at setting 2 ‚Üí same problem

Increasing the dose to 19g ‚Üí barely pushed the pressure to the start of the optimal range


Has anyone experienced something like this or have suggestions on what could be causing it?

Thanks!

1o504qa,https://v.redd.it/epyy4p9lsquf1,Harassed by Police in Marrakech and stopped from filming under threat,"For context, I was hanging around one of the Gen-Z protests locations in Marrakech but nobody had showed up yet. So I decided to grab a coffee and wait for a bit. At some point, some sketchy middle-aged dude (likely an undercover cop) sits besides me and asked if I‚Äôm part of the Gen-Z movement, I responded that I didn‚Äôt understand Darija well but I felt something off.

At that point I stood up and started walking away when I was approached from behind by another undercover cop asking me for my I.D, so I give him my E.U passport, he takes a picture of it and lets me go. Not even 5 minutes later I‚Äôm ambushed by 4 more undercovers in bikes who start questioning me about all of kinds of political stuff. 

Since I felt concerned I started recording, but I was stopped from doing so immediately, him saying it is against the law. In the end, after 30 minutes of me asserting my right to remain silent and threatening to call the Embassy they finally let me go since I did not commit any crime.

Finding such a space is surprisingly difficult.

For a while, I thought Twitter might be what I was looking for. But no even though there are fewer Bangladeshis there compared to Facebook or Instagram, it‚Äôs still filled with the same kind of noise and chaos.

So I kept searching. I wanted something peaceful like a quiet coffee shop or a small club, where a few thoughtful people gather. People who can think freely, who love learning new things, and who have the humility to encourage others.

And finally, I think I‚Äôve found it in Mastodon.
It‚Äôs an exceptional social platform, calm and refreshing. I won‚Äôt go into the technical details, but to me, it feels like I‚Äôve found my own little coffee shop tucked away in a quiet corner of the internet.

There aren‚Äôt many people here yet, but that‚Äôs part of its charm. So, if you‚Äôve read this far and you‚Äôre also tired of the mainstream noise maybe it‚Äôs time you checked out Mastodon too.

I‚Äôm accustomed to drinking at least 3-4 cups of coffee per day, up to 8 cups. I used to take caffeine pills before I got out of bed each morning, as well as using energy drinks when I was in school. I stopped the pills and energy drinks and started drinking strictly coffee after my psychiatrist put me on Wellbutrin, which also acts like a stimulant (I have a history of depression but have ruled out thyroid dysfunction, neurological issues, narcolepsy and other sleep disorders, nutrient deficiencies, etc).

I cut out coffee completely about a week ago, and I‚Äôve been weaning off it by drinking green tea, but I can barely stay upright to sit at my desk. I took the trash out the other night and got lightheaded and lost my vision for a few seconds while going down the stairs. I can‚Äôt nap, either, even if I skip the tea. I just feel completely drained, like I‚Äôm sick without an actual infection, or drunk without any alcohol. Even holding my phone up while lying in bed is a struggle. 

Is this normal? Does it get better? I can‚Äôt tell the difference between caffeine withdrawal and depression.

I tapped her on the shoulder since she walked passed me. Her eyes got WIDE when she turned around and she got a little awkward, which in turn made me a little awkward? I asked her name, gave her mine, told her i saw her around and asked if she was on her way to our parish‚Äôs aftermass meetup we have every week. 

She declined since she helps the catechism classes after mass. She said it all with a smile, and said she‚Äôd see me around. Fast forward to today, and I think I caught her glancing at me still? When mass ended she was on her way out, and was passing my pew, being right next to me. At our parish it isn‚Äôt really customary to talk in the nave, and idk if she was nervous/shy or uncomfortable to be around me, but her eyes were kind of looking everywhere when she walked by.

Now, I plan this coming week to ask her out to coffee sometime this/next month, as I know she is legitimately busy immediately after mass.

1o501qg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o501qg,"The time slip at bold street,  Liverpool","It was a bright Saturday afternoon in Liverpool, sometime in the early 1990s.
Frank, a retired police officer, was out shopping with his wife, Carol. They strolled together along Bold Street, a lively, sunlit road lined with caf√©s and shops, where the air smelled faintly of coffee and new books.

At the top of the street, Carol decided to pop into Dillons Bookshop (now Waterstones) to buy a book she‚Äôd been wanting.Frank said he‚Äôd go to another shop first, and they‚Äôd meet outside in a few minutes.

As he crossed the road toward the bookshop to meet her, Frank suddenly felt something strange as if the world around him had gone silent. The sound of traffic and chatter faded into a kind of muffled hum. The air seemed thicker, heavier, almost like walking through warm water. Confused, he looked around. Cars on the street looked‚Ä¶ different older, rounded models, their paint gleaming in soft, muted colours. The people, too, were dressed oddly men in long overcoats and hats, women in scarves and dresses that looked like something from the 1950s. Even the smell in the air had changed a mix of coal smoke and car exhaust, the scent of a different era.

Frank‚Äôs heart thudded. He looked across the street at the bookshop ‚Äî only it wasn‚Äôt Dillons anymore. The sign above the door  had now read ‚ÄúCripps.‚Äù He blinked, thinking his eyes were playing tricks, but the word was clear. Through the window he saw displays of women‚Äôs handbags, shoes, and coats, neatly arranged in vintage style. Then a young woman in modern clothes a short skirt, sleeveless top, and handbag walked past him. She, too, was glancing around, frowning at the strange scene. She headed toward the door of Cripps, clearly puzzled Frank followed her.

The woman opened the door and stepped inside and in that instant, the scene snapped back to the present. The noise of the city rushed in, cars honked, footsteps echoed, and Cripps was gone.
In its place stood Dillons Bookshop, just as it had been minutes before.
The woman turned, pale and shaken. ‚ÄúI thought it was a clothes shop,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúI was sure it was.‚Äù

Frank nodded. ‚ÄúSo did I.‚Äù

Later, curious, he researched the name he‚Äôd seen. There really had been a shop called Cripps on Bold Street a women‚Äôs clothing store that had closed in the 1950s, decades earlier.

How do you find your people as an HSP?,"TL;DR: I‚Äôm a highly sensitive, high sensation seeker who feels too alive for the world around me. I crave depth, fun, spontaneity and real connection, but most people feel shallow, boring or constrained. The only person I ever really connected with was a former therapy client, who I obviously had to let go for ethical reasons. I‚Äôm happily partnered, but I still want friends who ‚Äòget it‚Äô. How do you find your people as an HSP?


Full post:

I have recently come to terms with the fact that I am highly sensitive but also a high sensation seeker.

I often feel like I live in a world that doesn‚Äôt move at my pace, and it‚Äôs a very lonely experience. I don‚Äôt feel superior to others in any way, but I do feel different from most people. I notice things that others seem to miss; I feel energy, changes in moods, subtleties‚Ä¶and I crave meaning, depth, laughter, fun, adventure.

Maybe some will say ‚Äúwho doesn‚Äôt? It‚Äôs human to crave those things!‚Äù and I‚Äôm aware of that. But it feels like I‚Äôm surrounded by people who just live to work, to exist, to hide their real selves. It‚Äôs sad, because I believe many have simply conformed to situations they feel they can‚Äôt change ‚Äì or maybe it‚Äôs their way of coping with trauma and lack of connection to their true selves. I‚Äôd actually prefer someone said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a rough time,‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine‚Äù when I know it‚Äôs not true!

I crave spontaneity, that kind when someone says, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get in the car tomorrow and go somewhere fun.‚Äù I love creative, real, fiery people, fun and deep but also down to earth at the same time; highly sensitives who are not afraid of their feelings, who can truly enjoy themselves at a concert without needing alcohol or drugs, or debate philosophical and existential questions over a long walk in the park.

I love those moments that feel electric and full of life. I miss that feeling you have as a teenager, when you and your friends randomly stay out longer because you meet another group through friends in common who invite you to someone‚Äôs party. Instead, I will now go to a caf√© hoping for some interesting folk, a random gig, a cool conversation with a stranger‚Ä¶but instead there‚Äôs a group of young mums with their toddlers and perhaps some elderly ladies having tea, and the place closes at 2 or 4 p.m. If I meet someone for coffee, they usually need to leave after an hour because of kids or errands or whatever. I know one can still find meaning in those moments, and I‚Äôm grateful, but I just want people who match my vibe‚Ä¶ if that makes sense.

Once I saw a group of maybe six people having lunch together; they looked alternative, quirky, not afraid of being themselves. They were laughing and chatting, and I thought ‚Äúoh, I so wish I had that‚Äù‚Ä¶

Then there was this client I once had (I am a therapist). He had the same music taste, the same way of processing feelings and thoughts , the same struggles with finding real connection and fun, the same mindset, the same high sensitivity, the same hunger for adventure and meaning‚Ä¶Listening to him was even spooky, like having a mirror in front of me. The transference became too strong, I got too triggered during sessions and had to make the ethical decision to let him go. It broke something in me, for once I had found that kind of person I‚Äôd been searching for ‚Äì and it had to happen in the one context where I couldn‚Äôt stay or say anything! He will probably never know the real reasons behind my decision, and I feel terrible about it (even though I know it was the right thing to do).

Since then, I‚Äôve tried to make new friends ‚Äì signed up for friendship apps, joined yoga and other hobby classes... I met just one person I got along with, but guess what‚Ä¶ ? Soon after meeting her, I found out she was friends with that same client I mentioned (I live in a relatively small area), which meant I couldn‚Äôt join her group for ethical reasons‚Ä¶.It‚Äôs just so frustrating.

Am I the only one who feels like this? Like nothing is enough, like people ‚Äòdon‚Äôt get it‚Äô, like everything is too surface level‚Ä¶
I would love to hear from anyone who has found ways to create or stumble upon that kind of connection or friendship; how did it happen? How did you folks find your tribe?

1o4zy2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1o4zy2h/discover_if_ispring_f9k_water_filter_replacement/,Discover if iSpring F9K Water Filter Replacement Pack Fits Your RO System Review,"**Testing the iSpring F9K Water Filter Replacement Pack**

Trying out the iSpring F9K NSF Certified 1-Year Reverse Osmosis Water Filter Replacement Pack was an interesting experience. After all, a good water filtration system can be transformative, not just for drinking water but for cooking, ice-making, and even making tea or coffee taste better. As someone who loves a good cup of coffee and wants the cleanest water for my household, I had some high expectations. Here‚Äôs how this product fared after daily use over several weeks.

**Ease of Installation**

Installing this filter replacement pack was, for the most part, straightforward. While the set does include updated FA15 alkaline mineral filters and FT15 post-carbon filters built with secure push-fit quick connections, I did need to refer to the user manual for some guidance. The process still took a bit of time, especially because I wanted to ensure everything fit correctly. This is not something you install in five minutes, but with patience, most people will be able to do it. The inclusion of separate cartridges for sediments, granular activated carbon, carbon block, and alkaline remineralization is stellar. It covers all bases in providing clean, pH-balanced water.

**Performance & Water Quality**

The performance of this replacement pack is where it really shines. Each time I turned on the faucet, I was met with crystal-clear, fresh-tasting water. Not only did the water taste noticeably better, but it also made subtle improvements in tea and coffee flavor. Having alkaline water enriched with minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium was a big plus for me since I know these are essential for a healthy diet. 

One standout moment came when a friend commented on how much better our ice cubes looked and tasted. I hadn't realized until then how murky our ice used to be compared to how clear and refreshing it had become. These seemingly minor improvements added up to make a noticeable difference in daily life.

[Grab your iSpring F9K Replacement Pack at the best price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00boasj1m/)

**Build Quality & Materials**

This filtration set is made of high-quality materials, including polypropylene, granular activated carbon, and carbon block. The cartridges felt sturdy, and they integrated seamlessly with existing systems. Another thing worth mentioning is that the pack does not include the reverse osmosis membrane itself. This isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker, but it‚Äôs something to keep in mind. The rest of the components, though, seem durable enough to survive the year-long replacement cycle. One does have to remember that these cartridges have standardized dimensions, so replacements should fit most 6-stage RO systems.

**Key Benefits**

- The water is noticeably improved with clean, crisp quality.
- Alkaline filters reintroduce healthy, natural minerals.
- Designed for seamless compatibility with standard 6-stage RO systems.
- The secure push-fit connections make replacements less intimidating.

**Limitations**

- The RO membrane isn‚Äôt included, which might catch some first-time buyers off guard.
- Setup requires time and a good understanding of filter connections.
- Some users may experience dripping during the process if not installed carefully.

**Competitive Options**

When comparing this product to its competitors, such as the APEC Top Tier 5-Stage Filter Set or the Express Water RO5DX Replacement Filters, I noticed some stark differences. The APEC set is reliable but lacks the alkaline remineralization feature, which is a big deal if you care about balanced pH levels in your water. The Express Water setup includes most of the same filters but comes with less user-friendly installation steps, based on what a coworker of mine experienced with hers.

Where iSpring F9K excels is in simplicity, affordability, and its ability to provide alkaline water, which sets it apart. However, it doesn‚Äôt quite measure up to certain competitors when looking at budget-friendly options that include the RO membrane.

**Price Worthiness**

While the cost of this replacement pack might not be the absolute lowest in the market, its value is undeniable. The features, from alkaline add-ons to secure fit connections, make it worth splurging a little extra. I‚Äôve definitely seen water filter packs that cost less but compromise on quality or leave out important components. Overall, this replacement set offers great quality for the price and ensures a marked improvement in water taste and safety.

We won‚Äôt have a car, so we‚Äôll be relying on public transport (train or bus). Are there any nice places we could reach that way for a day trip?
Also, if you have any local tips for coffee, breakfast, or food spots that you think visitors shouldn‚Äôt miss, please share them!
And finally, any other information is appreciated.
Thanks a lot in advance! :)

I just kicked off a 22:2 OMAD fast and was wondering about teas, and specifically infused teas like peppermint. Is that safe to consume during my fast window?  
  
I'm generally a coffee drinker, and when doing a 12:12 or even 16:8 fast, it's easy enough to stick to black coffee and water, but couldn't stick with just coffee for longer fasting periods.

So I suppose the question really is, will drinking black peppermint tea (for example) break my fast?",2,1760300703.0,intermittentfasting,3,0.75,False

Starting weight 129kg / 284lbs / 20.3 stone.

Current weight 88.2kg / 194lbs / 13.9 stone.

Total lost: 40.8kg / 90lbs / 6.4 stone.

Provider: Med Express

Pen tactic: 4 weeks on each dose up to 15mg, 7x 15mg, and now titrating back down (due to cost uplift and approaching decent weight)

Overall spend on pens: ¬£2,460

¬£/kg: ¬£60.30

¬£/lb: ¬£27.40

¬£/st: ¬£383.67

Average weekly loss: 0.77kg / 1.69lb

General comments: Much, much happier with how I look and feel. Have replaced almost my entire wardrobe, going from mostly XXL to L, 38-40inch Jeans to 32-33inch. Compliments at work, among friends and family.

My partner preferred me with more 'meat' especially now we are approaching the colder months lol.

Other observations:

Libido seems much higher

Appetite for beer has faded a lot; tend to prefer sweeter drinks these days, and whisky.

Cannot drink coffee anymore, find it quite unpalatable. This may be because I drink slowly and cannot stand lukewarm/cold coffee. Tend to get caffeine from energy drinks instead which I can sip over multiple hours.

My next two pens are 10mg and I will see how they go. I am around 3kg from turning my bmi green for first time in my adult life. The ongoing cost is something I need to monitor/ manage but it has been worth every penny to me so far.

Good luck to everyone else with their ongoing journeys...",20,1760300700.0,UKMounjaro,3,0.95,False

1o4zogq,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1o4zogq/my_girlfriend_makes_me_so_happy_despite_our_age/,My girlfriend makes me so happy despite our age gap.,"I'm 22. She's 49. We're both women. Last winter, I was at a very low place both emotionally and physically. My anxiety was through the roof and I also struggled with unexplainable physical symptoms that no doctor could give me an answer to. I was bedridden. In January, I attended a panic attack sippor group. That's where we met.

The first time I saw her I thought she was just this incredibly kind-looking woman. We were sitting in a circle with all the other people in the group, and everyone got their own turns to speak. She always nodded or gave a small encouraging smile to anyone who was talking. When it came her turn, she was obviously a little bit shy, but she kept smiling the whole time. At one point we had a break and everyone was allowed to get coffee and biscuits from the nearby table. I approached her, asked her how she was, what she likes doing in her free time.  

We got to talking more and next week we met up for lunch. My anxiety is partially related to eating in public, and so once we got our orders I got a wave of anxiety and an incoming panic attack. She noticed immediately (as this is something she also struggles with) and asked the barista if she could wrap our food in a takeaway bag. We went to eat in her car in the parking lot. 

After that we started meeting up more regularly, most often in low-key, quiet places for both of our anxieties' sake until I felt comfortable and safe enough about her to go to her home when she invited me. We started a TV show together, ordered food, and relaxed on her couch under blankets. She held me under her arm and it was the sweetest thing everüò© That night I also found out that she has two kids from her marriage to her ex-husband, and that she's only ever been interested in men. But she said that I made her want to change her mind, even though she was very hesitant about the age gap at first.

We began officially dating in March, and ever since then I'm the happiest I have ever been. We're both major introverts so we don't even see each other every day, and that's fine because it keeps us both from getting overwhelmed. She's a very thoughtful person. She knitted me socks for my birthday because I'd told her I had cold feet üò©‚ù§Ô∏è

Don't get me wrong, my problems haven't mysteriously ""disappeared"" after getting a girlfriend - I still deal with a lot of shit on my own, some things even she just can't help with - but last year this time I didn't care if I woke up in the morning. Now I go to sleep every night begging that I will because I want to see her again.

# Chapter 1: A Static Beginning

She was the most beautiful woman in the world. When she looked at me, all that I could do was stare, entranced. Every little worry fell to the wayside. Her eyes were like twin stars, glittering with cosmic, universal optimism and her smile streaked across the sky, a comet singing in the night. A nebula of sunlit blonde hair fell between her moon-shaped glasses and her wide, goofy ears, widened out to envelope the galaxy with color. She was the most perfect person in the world, and she looked at me like that. I could go on about her freckles, and how I‚Äôve picked out constellations in their patterns, or the way she said patterns like pat-tahns, or I could spell out the words she would say absently and intermittently as if they were fuzzy images taken from a satellite hundreds of thousands of miles above a planet bursting with mystery. It could never be enough.

It was hard *not* to fall in love with someone like that.

She asked me how I could do the impossible, but I felt the black hole tugging at my wrist. The pain of that day, all those years ago resurfacing. I could not go back to that dark place again. I can not go back. I let the topic die, because I do not know how to explain it.¬†

Her lips parted. She wanted to say something, but she caught herself. The question went unsaid, hanging onto the wind as an unsung swan song dances at the back of her throat. I still did not know what she wanted to say. I did not think I would ever know, but the memory subsisted. My final thoughts of her remained a mystery without an answer. But I will always remember her as my universe.¬†

‚ÄúMonty‚Ä¶‚Äù her lips part, the air pulled through a tiny whisper, the remnants of a lost thought. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stop it.‚Äù Her words fall on deaf ears. I was not listening. I was memorizing her face. I burned the contours of her bright cheeks into the folds of my brain, locking away the sweet smell of vanilla that followed her wherever she went.

I did not want to let her go.

‚ÄúYou have to let me go.‚Äù

I will not.

Then I felt it. The world collapsed. I noticed it first when the pain in my chest grew beyond that of heartbreak. It was like a fire that consumed me from the inside. The heat traveled up my throat like a chimney, and I felt the walls of my lungs chip away from the smoke. It was harder to breathe now.

I saw it. The world imploded in on itself, a rippling maelstrom of an ill begotten futures raced towards the finish line. The storm felt personal. It was a cannibal eating itself, fostering self-destruction.¬†

A bright light emerged from the destruction. It invaded reality like an unsanctioned thought. Someone else was reaching into my world.¬†

I would not let them.

My hand reached out and an unnatural force found me. It pulled me in like a whirlpool of concentrated power. I continued to hold her, but my fingers slipped, and the universe took her.

And I was alone‚Ä¶again.

\*\*\*

The chatter from two plastic-coated newscasters filled the living room of our apartment with a natural melody. The brownstone walls bounced their voices across from room to room. I could hear them clearly from the kitchen. My hands, too small to hold my dad‚Äôs mug, wrapped around a kid‚Äôs juice box. As I drank from it, I measured the crinkles of the box in harmony with the talking heads.¬†

One of the casters had a voice that pitched up and down, fluctuating, leading into an innocuous pattern that sounded more like a bird chirping than an actual human being. I was surprised it had not put mom to sleep yet. The crackle of the screen brought them to life, giving texture to the drivel.¬†

‚Äú‚è§Thank you Jennifer. Now, onto the weather‚è§‚Äù

The static tickled my ears in a unique way. I liked to sit all too close to the tv because of it. It has put me in a bad standing with my mom on more than one occasion.

‚ÄúReady for school?‚Äù My father walked in with his greasy hair pulled up into a tight knot. His hands, each larger than my face, squeezed my shoulders as he nuzzled his fuzzy beard against my head. When we pulled apart, he smiled at me, and rubbed his hand in my hair to mess it up even more.

‚ÄúStop that!‚Äù I shouted. My smile was too wide to even pretend to be furious. It came in spite of my personal volition.¬†

My mom, clearly amused with our conversation, called out from the living room, ‚ÄúPapa! Give the poor kid a break.‚Äù My dad always smiled when he heard her. It was like an automatic response. It was kinda like how my action figures would say something when you pressed the button on their back. It just came out naturally, without leaving any room for nuance.¬†

Of course, the two were a little different, but I was eleven. What else mattered more than my father and my action figures? Nothing, I can assure that.

‚Äú‚è§Looks like it‚Äôs going to be thunderclouds all afternoon, and rolling into the ev‚è§‚Äù

As my dad pulls off of me, turning his back towards the stove to fix up some breakfast, my mom enters the kitchen. Bringing her index finger to her lips, she gives me a wink and shhhh. She successfully sneaks up on dad and gives him a hug from behind. Somehow he knew she was there. At her touch his stoicism crumbled. His giggles were so infectious that they soon spread to mom, and subsequently to me.

Goofballs, I thought.

‚Äú‚è§careful driving tonight. Looks like it‚Äôs shaping up to be a heck of a storm‚è§‚Äù¬†

The static crackles like a fireplace. And mom looks back towards the living room. She separates from dad and goes to pick up the landline.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm comfortable with Monty going to school today. Looks like it's gonna be Hell to drive in that.‚Äù

‚ÄúLanguage,‚Äù dad said, laughing.

Mom feigned a pout and began dialing the number for school. She listened for the other side of the line before she maneuvered her way to the front office. Dad looked down at me and smiled, sliding over a plate of eggs and bacon arranged into a smile.

‚ÄúWhat do you think kiddo? Movie marathon?‚Äù

My eyes lit up. It has been so long since we have done one.

‚ÄúHow about that one series with the time-traveling car? Something, something, to-the-future?‚Äù he said.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the snacks ready!‚Äù I said, scarfing up my breakfast and jumping down to start looking for the bags of popcorn and any sweets not nailed down. My dad only laughs, going to work on the frying pan he just used with a barrage of soapy swipes. I found what I was looking for and ran to the living room.

As I entered the hallway between my living room and kitchen I passed by my mom, who gently pats me on the head as she pulls out her ringing work phone after hanging up on her call to the school.

‚ÄúHold on kiddo, I‚Äôm just going to answer it. I‚Äôll be right in.‚Äù

I nodded my head furiously, snacks pouring out of my arms like an overflowing cornucopia. A few snacks drop to my feet. I‚Äôll just come back for them, I tell myself. The living room is empty except for the tv, blaring to life with images of winter snowscapes. The snowflakes were like popcorn, falling between the city‚Äôs cracks. I imagine what it would be like if it really was popcorn. How many people would not go hungry this winter? How many people would be saved? I set everything down on the coffee table, looking towards the tv to watch.

‚Äú‚è§This is a blizzard for the history books, folks. Make sure to stay safe out there‚è§‚Äù

*Crackle*

I started to feel it, the crackle of the tv.

*Crackle*

It courses through my fingertips. It felt like my hands were falling asleep. Just a light tingling.

*Crackle‚Ä¶crackle‚Ä¶CRACK!*

An explosion erupted, plunging the apartment in a maelstrom of lightning and pressure. It spread out from the tv to the carpet to the table and the couch, and to me. The table split down the center, cotton innards spewed out between the cushions, and snacks exploded in a volley of popcorn kernels and burnt sweets. I feel a pressure weighing me down, like a weighted blanket. It would have been funny, If it had not been for the stranger who appeared at the nexus of the explosion.¬†

He was tall with dark, scraggy hair reaching just past his ears. His eyes were cobalt blue, and seemingly glowed in the light of the supernatural energy. Or were they actually glowing? He wore a blue and white body suit, with some sort of symbol on the front chest. He looked like‚Ä¶a superhero.

I was too stunned to speak. All I could do was stare. He looked at me and smiled, like he was looking at a friend‚è§someone he has known for a very long time. But behind the smile, there is a pain, almost unimaginable to a kid like me. It was like looking at a broken action figure. I felt‚Ä¶sorry for him.

The shouts from my parents were muffled, like I had been plunged into the deep end of a pool, and I was too far from the surface to climb out. They placed themselves between me and the stranger. I think even then, I knew there was nothing we could do.

But as my parents stood up to the stranger, I could feel their eyes soften. They shouted and threatened to call the police, but my father quickly went quiet, and my mother followed. They looked like they knew him, their eyes glowed that same blue, like the blue of my eyes, an electric, cobalt-blue. The last time I saw my parents was when I curled around to look back at them as they realized who was standing in the room.

‚ÄúI am so‚è§so sorry. Please forgive me.‚Äù His voice cracked, and the smile wavered, but it did not look cruel. His eyes were soft.¬†

‚ÄúMonty‚è§‚Äù¬†

All I remembered next were the sounds of popcorn popping and brick walls turning to rubble.

I'm a graphic designer and occasionally like going to coffee shops to work, but I can't stand MacOS. It's weird because I used to daily drive a MacBook all my life. I had a 2012 unibody MBP throughout high school and a 2017 15 inch model in college, but MacOS after Catalina has gotten progressively unbearable to use. MacOS these days looks and feels like its been baby-proofed, idk how else to explain it. I hate using my current 14 inch MacBook for anything design related, which is unfortunate bc the battery and screen are insanely good.

So I'm selling my current MacBook and looking to replace my PC with an equally powerful laptop. I'll be keeping it docked to a 32 inch monitor about 75% of the time, and occasionally take it with me on trips, cafes, or to use in bed.

I like the form factor of the G16, but hearing about battery health issues and quality control is worrying. I also don't know if a laptop this thin should be used as a permanent desktop replacement. The Legion 7i looks a little more robust, but has worse screen reflectivity and battery life.

The new hire was transferred to a different location due to backlash from R and another employee, and the first 2 screenshots are my roommates responses to the update.

Lately, I‚Äôve been having a lot of conversations with Oracle practitioners about AI.
The energy is high, the curiosity genuine.
But too often, the story stops at the outer shell: GenAI and agents.

They‚Äôre exciting, no doubt. They make things look effortless.
But as I sip my coffee and think about the systems I‚Äôve worked with, I keep coming back to this image:
Oracle AI feels like a set of Russian dolls,  elegant layers, each one revealing a deeper layer of capability inside.

At the surface, AI has quietly lived inside Fusion Apps for years, forecasting, matching, and optimizing long before anyone called it GenAI.
Now these apps are gaining embedded agents, born right inside workflows, connecting intelligence with action.
It‚Äôs not hype, it's evolution.

Open the next doll, and you reach OCI AI Services.
Language. Vision. Anomaly Detection. Forecasting.
And yes, Generative AI and Agents too.
This layer makes AI ready-to-use intelligence that teams can plug in without starting from scratch, without custom code.

Go a little deeper, and the story shifts. Here you find OCI Data Science,  the playground for builders who like to get their hands dirty.
This is where models are fine-tuned, pipelines automated, and experiments turned into products.
It‚Äôs the world I wrote about in my book üìñ ""Natural Language Processing on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure"" with #Apress, where data meets design, and AI starts adapting to each organization‚Äôs bespoke needs.

And at the smallest, strongest doll,  the data layer, everything comes together.
With Oracle Database 23ai and AI Vector Search, intelligence now lives inside the data itself.
Retrieval, reasoning, and governance all in one place  close to truth, not copies.
That‚Äôs also the focus of the new book I‚Äôm co-authoring with #Packt, diving into how Oracle‚Äôs data and AI layers truly connect. 

Viewed together, the stack forms a clear continuum, from embedded agents to GenAI, through managed services and development platforms, to AI in the database itself.

Many open the first doll. Few explore the rest...

When I open the maps in Godot, it comes up with orthoganol nonsense, rather than the actual map. Does anyone know why?
