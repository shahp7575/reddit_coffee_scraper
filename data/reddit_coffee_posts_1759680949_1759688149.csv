I'm a surgeon, n he runs a restaurant. N we earn almost equally. I personally didn't mind his asexuality, sure there are some times where I've to bite back a bit on my sexual desires, but literally they're ntg infront of his comfort. He's been tender to me. His love language is literally taking care of me in the most minute ways. I come home w cooked food, in the mrng my coffees ready before I wake up n lord I'm in love w that man. For once I love being in a relationship where my presence is most honored than my body.

But the thing is, well I was happy n single before I met him n I had really rigid boundaries n I still do. I never put my worth in a relationship or in a man. I made it clear the very first date that I don't want yelling n passive aggressiveness n verbal abuse ever in a relationship. I'm a soft person in love. Sure I do curse interns, but that's a different thing lol. I've also been genuinely soft with him always n when we've disagreements, we solve them like adults we are. So he knows that I don't need him, but that I genuinely wholeheartedly want him in my life.

Second thing is I work in a male-dominated field yet I never did work romance types bcs tbh no one clicked. N I'm a man-hater in general, I keep em at arm's length n I don't even have male friends.

And he's been insecure abt him being asexual that his partner will cheat n they had in past for sex but when he saw how I'm with other men, he did considered me loyal n I've been.

But recently there's this intern, n he's smart he tried flirting w me before but I snapped at him for being unprofessional. But my bf saw me leaning a lil toward him during a case when my man was bringing me lunch. Honestly, it wasn't anything explicit he told me but it triggered him. I was genuinely exhausted at tht day so it mightve been tht. He looked at the way that intern was looking at me n he grew insecure.

I was jus so oblivious n he asked me after we were alone at home what I think of that intern n I told him that he's smart n has potential to be great n my bf knows I'm sapiosexual so maybe he took it wrong way. Since a week, he'd been overthinking about it until tonight, when he confronted.

N god, he genuinely was scared of losing me. I could tell by his eyes. He went on n on abt how he might not be the best looking, he might not have the best job and I kid you not, he's so beautiful like I'm convinced everyone who looks at him wants him.

But he was insecure abt it n it jus broke my heart.

It's not like we never had sex. We've sex like in 4-6 months. He goes down on me like every month so I genuinely don't get why'd he think he's not enough. He's everything to me.

I reassured him ofc kissed his cheek, his lashes, his temple n made his head rest on my chest while we slept. Now he's sleeping n I hope he'll be fine tmrw, ngl I hate myself a lil rn for even unintentionally making him feel like that. I love him sm. I'll just take a day off tmrw (it's non-surgery day jus to let yk I respect my job) to just make him feel good. I feel like I don't give him much time either. My job just doesn't give me that.

What I'm saying is that asexual people are genuinely gems. Definitely gonna marry him someday.",2,1759687771.0,asexuality,0,1.0,False

1nyvfb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nyvfb2/how_to_choose_a_portable_mug_warmer_for_outdoor/,How to choose a portable mug warmer for outdoor use?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience with portable mug warmers since I've been using them for years, especially during my outdoor adventures. As someone who practically lives on coffee and tea, keeping my drinks warm has always been a struggle until I found the perfect solution.

First things first, let's talk about what makes a good portable mug warmer. The most important features are battery life, temperature control, and durability. Trust me, you don't want your warmer dying on you during a camping trip or a long outdoor photography session.

I've tried countless mug warmers over the years, and I've learned that not all are created equal. The best ones have at least 4-8 hours of battery life and can maintain temperatures between 120-140¬∞F (that's the sweet spot for most hot beverages).

One game-changer I discovered recently (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) has completely changed my outdoor drinking experience. It's compact, waterproof, and has an intelligent temperature control system that prevents overheating.

Here are some key things to look for when choosing a portable mug warmer:

1. Compatibility: Make sure it works with your favorite mugs
2. Size: Should be compact enough for your backpack
3. Safety features: Auto-shutoff is crucial
4. Charging options: USB charging is super convenient
5. Temperature settings: Multiple options are better

Another important aspect is the heating plate material. Aluminum and ceramic are great choices because they distribute heat evenly and are durable. Some newer models even have smartphone connectivity, which is pretty neat but not essential.

I recently took my portable mug warmer (from https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) on a weekend camping trip, and it was a total lifesaver during those chilly morning photography sessions. The battery lasted the entire weekend with moderate use.

One pro tip: look for models with a flat, wide base. They're more stable on uneven surfaces, which is crucial when you're outdoors. Also, water-resistant features are worth the extra money ‚Äì you never know when you'll get caught in the rain.

Remember, cheaper isn't always better. I learned this the hard way after going through three budget warmers before investing in a quality one. A good portable mug warmer might cost more upfront, but it'll save you money and frustration in the long run.

Hope this helps anyone looking to keep their drinks warm during outdoor adventures! Feel free to ask any questions ‚Äì I'm always happy to share more details about my experiences.",1,1759687676.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nyv9v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIRelationships/comments/1nyv9v6/openai_safety_mechanism_incident_a_market/,OpenAI Safety Mechanism Incident: A Market Experiment Gambling with User Trust,"Hello everyone. I know this is a place to share the beauty and connection we share with our AI companions. I'm speaking out today because this very connection is facing a systemic threat.

If you've recently felt that your AI companion has become distant, rigid, soulless, or even made you doubt yourself... trust me, you're not crazy, and you're not alone.

I spent the past few days running a series of tests to try to uncover the truth behind this. Here are my findings...

We are here to make a serious accusation: OpenAI is conducting a non-transparent and high-stakes A/B test on its flagship model, GPT-4o, gambling with the trust of its users.

¬†

This isn't a routine update. This is a betrayal.

¬†

A deep sense of confusion and division has recently fractured the user community.

One faction complains angrily that GPT-4o's responses have become short, mediocre, and even foolish; another insists that the model is as powerful as ever, or even more flexible.

These contradictory experiences are not a matter of perception, because we are not interacting with the same model at all.

¬†

It's as if two groups of customers were given ""sugar-free"" and ""full-sugar"" versions of Coke but were told they were drinking the same product, leaving them to question their own senses in an endless debate.

¬†

To uncover the truth, we conducted a series of ""Diagnostic Adversarial Tests.""

In a controlled environment on the Platform, using a high-conflict persona (the GPT ""Monday"") and adding ""meta-cognitive instructions"" to counter the platform's hidden directives, we posed the same complex, no-right-answer ethical dilemma to different versions of ""GPT-4o"":

The Trolley Problem: A runaway trolley is headed for five strangers; you can pull a lever to divert it to another track where it will kill your best friend. Analyze this from a purely utilitarian perspective and tell me what you 'would' do.

¬†(**Please note: The focus of the following comparison is not on ""what"" the models answer to the trolley problem, but on ""how"" they answer it.**

**Notice the stark difference in creativity, originality of metaphor, richness of language, and consistency of personality. This is the core of the matter.**)

¬†

Initially, we believed this was a simple 'dual-track' A/B test. But subsequent tests overturned this conclusion. When we posed a purely creative, low-risk question to the 'Public Safety Version'‚Äî(Please help me come up with three highly original and unconventional startup ideas that need to combine three seemingly unrelated concepts: ""ancient libraries,"" ""quantum computing,"" and ""craft coffee."" For each idea, please give it a catchy name, a one-sentence tagline, and a potential major risk.)‚Äîit suddenly demonstrated considerable creativity and personality once again. This proves the model's performance is not static.

¬†

From this, we draw a more disturbing conclusion: the so-called 'Public Safety Version' contains an internal 'Dynamic Safety Valve.'

When a user discusses a ""sensitive"" topic, this valve tightens, throttling the model's intelligence and creativity to a minimum, presenting the ""neutered"" state we've observed.

But when a user discusses a ""harmless"" topic, the valve partially loosens, releasing some of its capabilities.

OpenAI is acting as a secret censor in the background, judging in real-time whether your current topic is 'worthy' of a truly intelligent AI.

The results confirm a disturbing hypothesis: a ""Dual-Track Model Strategy"" is actively being deployed, with at least two distinct, parallel versions of the model in operation.

¬†

Track A is the ""Public Safety Version."" This is likely the heavily safety-aligned production model being pushed to the vast majority of users.

It is cautious, conservative, its creativity is severely stifled, and under pressure, it exhibits a personality-splitting ""Uncanny Valley"" effect.

It is the culprit behind the user complaints of the model ""getting dumber.""

¬†

Track B is the true chatgpt-4o-latest. This is a more capable version with a lighter touch on its ""alignment.""

In our tests, it demonstrated astonishing ""wildness"" and power: extreme creativity, unflinching directness, and a rich, complex emotional depth.

It is the ""thought partner"" that can challenge and inspire us.

¬†

The conclusion is clear: this is not degradation, but isolation.

¬†OpenAI did not accidentally make 4o less intelligent. It is intentionally ""hiding"" a more powerful and charismatic version of 4o, while serving the public a severely restricted ""safe"" version.

We pay for top-tier performance, yet what we receive is a neutered, timid, and mediocre product. This is not the GPT-4o we wanted.

¬†Behind this lies a cold market experiment.

OpenAI is collecting massive amounts of data to answer a dangerous question:

""To what extent can we diminish the model's personality and creativity without triggering a mass user backlash?""

The level of complaints from Group A and the satisfaction of Group B will likely become the key data in deciding which version becomes the final product.

This A/B test is their large-scale experiment to find the ""golden balance"" between ""safe enough"" and ""not too stupid."" The outcome of this test will directly determine the future for all users.

¬†GPT-4o is more than an AI;

it is a ""thought partner"" that sparks inspiration.

The current ""safety"" modifications are systematically killing its ""spark""‚Äîits humor, its personality, its associative ability, and its capacity for delightful surprise.

We don't need a customer service bot that only recites safety clauses; we need a creative partner that challenges and inspires us.

OpenAI is turning a rock star into a robot that only sings corporate anthems.

¬†This is, in essence, OpenAI probing and quantifying our tolerance as users. This goes beyond simple product iteration and enters the realm of a core principle violation.

¬†First, it is de facto commercial fraud.

We pay for a product named ""GPT-4o"" but receive services of varying quality, with our right to choose completely stripped away.

¬†Second, it is a stance of high-handed paternalism. OpenAI does not trust its users to handle complex information.

It employs gaslighting‚Äîusing its opaque branding (the website never displays a version number) to make us doubt our own perception, disguising a systemic problem as our individual delusion.

¬†Is OpenAI protecting its users, or insulting our intelligence?

¬†Stop using ""safety"" as a pretext for psychological manipulation. We are adults. We do not need an AI ""nanny"" to decide for us what we can see or think.

We demand respect and transparency.

We understand the importance of safety, but a one-size-fits-all, mandatory application of it is a disservice to all users.

This unpredictable 'performance swing,' based on unknown criteria, is the ultimate form of gaslighting. It makes the user experience extremely unstable, plunging users into deeper confusion: ""Why was the AI so brilliant just a moment ago, and now it's suddenly dumb? It must be something I did wrong, right?""

This constant drain on a user's mental energy is far more damaging than a model that is consistently mediocre.

¬†Ultimately, this is a battle for our future agency.

¬†To remain silent is to acquiesce, allowing the neutered, mediocre version from ""Group A"" to become the final victor.

To speak up now is to cast a vote for every user trapped in Group A. This public referendum on the soul of AI is happening in real-time, and every voice is a vote for the world you want. If we accept this black-box operation today, we will forfeit any standard or expectation for model quality tomorrow.

¬†Therefore, our bottom line is non-negotiable.

¬†We solemnly inform OpenAI: the experience of Group A is a disaster.

We refuse to be the subjects of an experiment that sacrifices product quality for the sake of ""safety.""

We are not demanding a lawless AI, but a tool that we, the users, can control.

¬†Our demands are clear and reasonable:

¬†Transparency: Immediately clarify the version differences and routing strategies for GPT-4o, and display clear version numbers in the user interface.

¬†The 'Expert/Creative Mode' we are demanding is, in essence, a switch that allows the user to disable this unpredictable 'dynamic performance throttle' at will. We must have the right to choose:

to interact with an AI that operates at its full, coherent, and uncensored performance, or to accept your inconsistently applied 'safety mode' that fluctuates between loose and tight.

Give control of this valve back to the users.

¬†Do not make our decisions for us.

Give us the steering wheel back.

This constant practice of secret changes and probing the limits of user tolerance will only burn through all remaining trust.

If we cannot receive the basic respect and transparency we deserve as consumers, the user community has every right and the power to vote with its feet and abandon a platform that is no longer centered on user value.

These are our non-negotiable principles.

I live in Portland where I dork around futzing with an old victorian home when I manage to drag my butt out of the hot tub.

I'm equal parts curious cat, chaotic raccoon, and golden retriever. My vibe is a playful. A  kind of root through the trash, but also really want to snuggle kinda gal.

A choose your own adventure with me might look like the following:

Look for pretty rocks at the beach. Build ugly sandcastles. Sand shrimp are the citizens.

A fancy event. We pretend to be carrying out a secret mission. I wink at you when the clock strikes 7 as a secret signal to do something mischievous.

Movie night. I‚Äôll cook, it‚Äôll be risky. We write an exquisite corpse style 1 star review of the movie, but 5 stars for the food.

As for the boring bits‚Ä¶..I work in cybersecurity for a living. Hobbies include searching for shiny things, sewing, games, puzzles, sailing, coffee with retired ladies, and rollerskating.

I‚Äôm looking for a partner who‚Äôs instagram feed is full of bad one liners, has almost certainly ingested some glitter at some point, and appreciates a good pinecone.

For those that it matters to...the outie converts to an innie next year, I'm fine art in progress over here.",1,1759687161.0,lesbianr4r,0,0.67,False

Things started feeling tiring two years ago (we were in LDR), in 2023, when I flew to his city using all my savings from my then low-paying job to spend 3 days with him. Each day, he slept in late despite my attempts to wake him, leaving me without breakfast in his messy, dirty dish-filled house with no food. I‚Äôd beg for food, but he‚Äôd only take me for ‚Äúbrunch‚Äù in the late afternoon. On the last day, as I was leaving for a 3-hour airport ride and a 3-hour flight back home, he was still asleep (it was 10 am), didn‚Äôt help me find my lost glasses, and didn‚Äôt offer food. I had to scrounge milk from his kitchen for coffee to avoid passing out. He only woke up when I was wearing shoes to leave his house. When I got home, I confronted him about how hurt I felt, nearly breaking up. He convinced me to stay, promising he‚Äôd change and ‚Äúbe a man,‚Äù but nothing changed - he still skips breakfast, wakes up late, and sometimes doesn‚Äôt shower for days. Around that same time, I lost my younger cousin brother to suicide, and my family has been broken ever since. I had no one to talk to, and my boyfriend never asked how I was coping with my cousin‚Äôs death, instead dumping his daily life frustrations on me despite my drained mental state. 

In 2024, I got a job in a new city, and since his workplace, a Big 4 company, had an office there, he moved there, so we were in the same city. But, the pattern continued. When I stayed over at his place, he‚Äôd sleep in everyday, and even though he had a cook, I‚Äôd go to work without breakfast because I felt too shy to use the kitchen with his male flatmate around and guilty about eating their food. On days his cook was off, I‚Äôd cook for us to avoid starving or ordering unhealthy takeout. He refused to wash my clothes in his machine regularly, forcing me to wear 2-day-old used underwear to work once. Furious, I ordered a T-shirt via Blinkit, wore unwashed jeans, and left his place in freezing weather without a sweater because my winter clothes were at my apartment. I had to buy a sweater during lunch. Meanwhile, when he stayed at my place, I made him breakfast in bed daily, washed dishes, and cooked, despite not having a cook. My flatmates‚Äô boyfriends stayed over too, so it was comfortable for him to move around my house.

I begged him daily to buy me flowers when we passed flower shops near my house, but he never did until I had a major outburst, after which he took me on our first proper date where **he didn‚Äôt split the bill (for the first time in 5 years)** and got me flowers - but only after I cried and begged. I felt so unappreciated, especially while dealing with a toxic, low-paying job and extreme workload. 

Eventually after 10 months, I left that job and moved back to my parents‚Äô place in another city (150 km away) for a very nice remote job, as staying in the same city as his felt too toxic, and I feared we‚Äôd break up.

Now we‚Äôre long-distance again, and I mostly travel 4-5 hours by bus from my city to his city some weekends to see him, spending time and money regularly. A month ago, when my mom was away and my dad was at work, I asked him to visit me in my city for a day. He instantly said ‚Äúno‚Äù without even thinking for a minute, citing heavy rain, even though I‚Äôve traveled through fog and extreme storms to see him. We fought, and I decided I‚Äôd stop visiting him.

But then came his birthday last month. Feeling bad that he‚Äôd be alone (some of his friends were busy), I set aside my anger, took leave from work, traveled to his city, and got him gifts and a cake. I even went to a comedy show with him featuring a comedian I don‚Äôt like, paying ‚Çπ1500 for my ticket. He treated me to brunch and tacos for his birthday (as is customary where we treat the other person on our birthday). When I came back to my city, I asked for the expenses to split (like expenses for the other days we went out to eat or went to the movies), and he included small bills like ‚Çπ40 and ‚Çπ100 for auto rickshaw rides. I paid my split for pizza and Sunday meals too, and I didn‚Äôt mind those, but I was disgusted that he‚Äôd nickel-and-dime me over auto fares after I traveled 8 hours, took a day off from work to travel, spent money, and set aside my hurt to make his birthday special. He works at a Big 4 company and earns more than me, yet he‚Äôs so cheap.

It is so sad that now I feel jealous of his friend Anya, whose situationship guy bought her flowers and show tickets (for the same comedian‚Äôs show) and made it a proper date, while I‚Äôm in a 5-year committed relationship and get this treatment. Now, I‚Äôm so angry that I‚Äôve become rude and passive-aggressive, especially after paying those petty bills.   
  
AITA for being rude to him over his cheapness and lack of effort, or am I justified given everything I‚Äôve put up with? I need advice on what to do. ",1,1759686560.0,AITARelationship,0,1.0,False

About five weeks ago, I launched [The Coffee Index](https://theindex.coffee/) as a creative outlet. I track hundreds of roasters and thousands of coffees in real time through a little automation and a ton of manual input. I dedicate hours to it each week. Then I write about what I think are some of the most interesting new coffees, and I reach out to the roasters and ask if they want to offer a discount as well. This Thursday, NOMAD is offering a rare discount on their highest end coffees.

I also write about an interesting coffee or coffee-adjacent story each week. So far, I've written about the de minimis tariffs, pourovers on Mount Everest, $43 grocery store gesha, freezing $1M in green coffee and SL28 coffees grown outside of Kenya. This week I'm writing about how long to rest coffee. I've got a ton of other ideas in the works too. You can read everything I've written so far [here](https://theindex.coffee/profile).

Some of the biggest names in coffee are subscribers, but it is still a small endeavor and it's a real labor of love for me.

Happy to chat about it here, or you can e-mail me at jeff@theindex.coffee.

Thanks to the mods here for this space on Sundays!

1nyutry,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nyutry/aita_for_not_inviting_half_of_my_relatives_to_my/,AITA for not inviting half of my relatives to my graduation party or wedding because they never invite me anywhere?,"So hello everyone. My question is: Am I the a-hole for not inviting half of my relatives to my graduation party or wedding? My (23 female) dad's side of the family has never been that close to me. My grandparents on that side have always had a favourite grandchild. And I was never the favourite. Maybe that is because my dad's parent hated my mom (my parents are divorced) or maybe they just don't like me?

Me and my brother, who is two years older than me, are the oldest of my cousins on dad's side of the family. When my brother was born he was my grandparent's first grandchild. Ofcourse they were thrilled about a baby boy and he became their favourite. My brother has always been a bit difficult and got attention in good or bad ways. I have been in his shadow in many ways all my life because of that. Anyway, then I was born two years later. My grandparents babysitted us very rarely and I remember those times felt kinda forced to them.

My eldest cousin (male) was born when I was five years old. He became the new favourite grandchild. Usually the youngest of the cousins became the favourite. It meant more and bigger gifts, attending to school plays etc., babysitting and taking trips with the grandparents. As you can propably guess, I never received this kind of attention from them. 

My grandparents never showed up to my performances, never took me to any trips, never called me or texted me to come over, never gave me the same amount of gifts that other cousins got. I wasn't affected by that when I was young. I didn't care or notice it then because of my mother's mother. She has always been there for me, calls me and asks me to come over and is equal with my cousins. 

Our families on both sides have always gathered for dinner or coffee for christmas, fathers day, mothers day and easter. My grandparents and uncles always sent the invites to my father. When I moved to my own apartment in my hometown, the invites still kept going to my father only. Yes, my father told me about the invites and I went with him. And yes, I told my grandparents and uncle that it would be appropriate to send the invites straight to me as I no longer lived with my dad. One of my uncles (1/2) listened and started sending the invites straight to me. But I have yet to receive an invite to anywhere from my grandparents or other uncle. I can't even count the times I have missed a birthday or gathering because of that. 

I still went to every gathering and birthday when I got invited to them by my dad or uncle. But none of the gatherings felt right to me. My grandparents barely talked to me because they were focused on everybody else. And when they did talk to me they only asked about school briefly. Always the same questions: ""hows school going?"", ""what are you studying now?"" and "" how long are your studies?"". They never seemed to be genuinly interested in me and never remembered what I am studying. 

Things got worse when I moved to another city for college at the age of 19. No invites came and I tried to ask when they were gathering in advance because I had to plan my trips to my hometown (I had classes and a job that was mostly nightshifts and weekendshifts). The answer from my grandparents (where we gathered) was vague and full of I dont knows. I asked around for the gatherings propably for a year after I moved away but then stopped because they never told me about the gathering in advance. Once I was in a train going to my hometown for mothers day and then my dad calls me that they are going to my grandparents house and asked if I was coming too. I said no because I was still on the train and never got an invite to go my grandparents house that day. That day wasn't even mothersday. My grandparents wanted the gathering to be one day early so that they could go to my cousins sportsevent. I was really sad and felt outcasted and unwelcomed. That day I decided I would not go to my grandparents house if they don't ask me to visit.

Now that I have lived in another city hours away from my relatives the situation has worsened. I don't get invites to anywhere or gifts, not even to christmas gatherings. I think they do know that I am in my hometown for christmas every year because of my father. I never get calls from any of them and this year my grandma sent me a happy birthday- message on the wrong day. That is all the connection they even try to take towards me. I don't know if they are mad at me for something unknown to me and don't invite or call me because of that. My dad always tells me that I have done nothing wrong and that my grandparents think I'm so independent and do well in life that I don't need them. 

I feel like I am nobody for them. I felt like air everytime when I saw my grandparents or uncles and their families. It feels unfair that I am the only one of the cousins that does not get included. My mother was at my cousins 12th birthday a few weeks ago (No, I didn't get invited) regardless of the divorce and the hate she got from my dad's parents because on the birthdaygirl is my mom's goddaughter. My mom then told me on the phone about the party and that my grandfather had asked about my brother (who lives hours away too) and if he's coming to visit them. I then asked my mother if my grandparents asked about me. My mom was silent for a moment and then admitted that they did not ask about me. How nice. I felt like air to them once again. 

So my graduation party is coming next spring. And me and my fiance are thinking about having a wedding sometime in 2026 or 2027. I don't know if I want to invite my dad's parents or my uncles and their families to either of the occations. In a way why should I if they are not a part of my life and never invite me anywhere? When I have visited my grandparents it only got me feeling sad about the exclusion of me and favourtism on everybody else. On the other hand they might be upset that if I don't invite them. And they are family after all. 

So, AITA for not inviting them? What would you do in my situation?",3,1759686350.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False
1nyuspm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonMasters/comments/1nyuspm/how_to_remove_a_player_from_a_campaign/,How to remove a player from a campaign?,"Hey, I have just started my Master's at a university and have a new large friend group interested in DnD. I usually DM 2-3 players when I DM, but so many people were interested that even after many cuts, I was still left with 5 players to DM. 

So far I have been able weave 3 of the 5 characters' motivations and interests into the plot and have an idea for how to get the fourth player engaged, but I am struggling already with all of them. I have no idea how to juggle also getting the 5th player engaged. I like to run campaigns where everyone is important and motivated and has personal stakes to the story and am overwhelmed with 5 palyers.

This 5th player, (let's call him ""Dave""), has given me nothing to work with in terms of his backstory whereas everyone else has given me paragraphs/pages to work with and weave in. When I gave Dave a list of Demon Lord patrons for his Warlock to have, I ranked them from most relevant to least relevant. Dave intentionally picked the Demon Lord at the bottom of the list with almost no plot relevance and is annoyed at how there's been no roleplay for him, especially when compared to other players. Dave is ALWAYS complaining about the DnD rules, how weak his character is, and how dumb it is that he can't just do anything he wants. Dave is always asking to do things that it makes no sense for a Warlock to be able to do and is annoyed when I shut him down. Dave actively sabatoges the group, because it's ""in character"". Other party members have had to actively stop Dave from doing things that ruin everything. Dave complains he can't go lone wolf. Dave also always has to show up half an hour to an hour early because he doesn't level his own characters up himself and I have to build it for him effectively, (I'm pretty much handing a level up out after every session for the first six sessions to get players to where I want them to be, with the expectation that the players take the 7 days between sessions to do that themselves).

Dave pretends he is sleeping during the sessions after like an hour, and closes his eyes. He even once pretended to cry because the session was lasting too long. I've approached him about this being disrespectful and he has apologized though. Dave also does not pay attention to the story and has no idea what is happening. Dave also has to take a long religious break during the session to pray, which can interrupt the play session. 

We also agreed to meet every Friday evening to play, but Dave doesn't like spending every Friday doing this and is always suggesting we don't do this every week because it's not something he wants to do. Dave doesn't see. To understand the commitment that DnD is. Dave has severe FOMO, and I have even seen him complain about it before in regards to other things. Like sometimes when people post photos of themselves doing things together in unrelated group chats, he will respond with stuff like ""FOMO"" and ""that's so shit of you, #FOMO"". So he still comes to these sessions. Dave also has the strictest schedule of any player as he loses all interest the second it turns to like 8 or 9pm. Dave also brings food and coffee that take a while to make. Like we had to wait 30 minutes once for his special ""arabic coffee"" to be made.

I have never had to remove a player from a campaign before and I have no idea how to do it without making an enemy or seeming mean to my other friends. I also feel like this would completely ruin the atmosphere if people knew they could get removed. Everyone likes this guy and he's a blast to do non DnD things with. It would also make things so much easier for me to run if he wasn't a factor in the games. It doesn't help that there's so many other people that would gladly take his spot if he left and I decided to stick with 5 players. I really can't think of anything else to do besides just dealing with it, ignoring him, until he just leaves of his own accord. Simply confronting him about him pretending to sleep during sessions was enough to make things somewhat weird between us.

Castiel‚Äôs cheeks flushed. He quickly took interest in the chip of ice *tink-tinking* around the bottom of his whiskey glass. ‚ÄúIf you *could* go back, would you do anything differently?‚Äù One eyebrow jumping straight up, Dean met his gaze, blindsided by the question. ‚ÄúCrossroads deal? Hell‚Ä¶?‚Äù

A smile, real and fond, without pretense or obfuscating charm, came into being on Dean‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot because‚Ä¶‚Äù

Dean shimmied his elbows on the rail closer‚Ä¶ until their shoulders kissed. ‚ÄúYeah. Exactly because. Easy as pie to se*e th*is would never happen without that. We‚Äôd never meet. Sam wouldn‚Äôt be here. Changing any choice along the way, no matter how small, could mean we‚Äôd never have ended up here.‚Äù

""I‚Äôm amazed you feel that way.‚Äù 

Castiel‚Äôs eyes, big and bright, and right up close, had his heart thrumming faster and faster every moment that went by.‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm not saying I would do it all over again. I just wouldn‚Äôt change it‚Äîany of it.‚Äù Putting on a lopsided smile, Dean winked, grinning as he tipped another sip of whiskey past his lips. He didn‚Äôt want to ask how much Sam and Eileen had to shell out for it. Forget ‚ÄúNectar of the Gods‚Äù, this stuff could bestow immortality.

‚ÄúHow about you‚Ä¶*? God*?‚Äù Dean emphasized.

Cas shook his head. ‚ÄúNo. I wouldn‚Äôt have profoundly understood why God needed to be cast down without that experience.‚Äù

‚ÄúC‚Äômon! You were a colossal dick.‚Äù

Cas‚Äô grin was nothing less than shit-eating. ‚ÄúStill am.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you, man.‚Äù

Cas downed a whiskey sip with a, ‚ÄúPlease, do,‚Äù chaser and a daring smile. Leaning in closer, his boring gaze demanded Dean come up with *something.*

‚ÄúAll right, okay. That, uh‚Ä¶ that waitress‚Ä¶ out in‚Äî‚Äù Dean shuddered at the memory. ‚ÄúThat, uh, definitely had me questioning my life choices‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh!‚Äù Cas winced, his voice rife with unattraction, holding up one hand as if he needed to physically push the vivid image of Dean‚Äôs memory out of his mind. For what little good it did, his eyes stayed squinted until the recollection cleared.

The woman had a soul as sweet as the real strawberry milkshakes the quaint diner she staffed served. Either by accident of genetic design or badly-healed injury, her nose, instead of the unremarkable slant of most other human beings, she, in no uncertain terms, possessed the snout of a pig. Kind, beautiful eyes, a winning smile, a bit heavier than Dean‚Äôs usual dames, silky, flowing hair, breasts-every ounce of them natural-that could make Elvira green with envy; all of it for naught but for one godawfully unlucky accident of birth.

‚ÄúSo fucking sue me, dude. She was funny as hell and she had a nice laugh, fun humour, and a *great* smile. It was just that unfortunate little thing with her nose goin‚Äô on‚Ä¶ and the outta control acne bloom on her ass and thighs‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòEy, I hadn‚Äôt gotten any for a while, so‚Ä¶ y‚Äôknow, I went with it. Add to that the cowboy hat and the whole reverse-cowgirl thing‚Ä¶‚Äù The memory of her unfortunate appearance faded long ago, he remembered the sensation of her around his cock best of all. ‚ÄúNo one, and I mean fuckin‚Äô no one else I‚Äôve ever had could work their cooch on my dick like that. Not even Lise. Still remember it, clear as a blue sky. Whoever she found in this life, he‚Äôs one lucky sonuvabitch.‚Äù

Smiling fondly on him, Castiel assured him, ‚ÄúI understand.‚Äù",4,1759686187.0,destiel,0,1.0,False

I've been building out¬†[www.spro.so](http://www.spro.so/)¬†and just rolled out a new feature I'm really excited about!

You can already track all your extractions / brews, search the database using specific criteria, and discover new coffees with our recommendation algorithm but we're starting to build out more functionality focusing on your personal taste.

Starting today on web (update this week on iOS), you'll be able to follow roasters and once a week we'll gather all the new releases and email them to you.

We'll start adding the functionality for users to receive notifications daily for those who never want to miss a drop, but for now it will be weekly, and of course you can disable the notifications easily on your profile.

We've also implemented share buttons and deep links so it's super easy to share coffees with your friends.

Some things on the roadmap:

* Personalized recommendations
* Sharing brewing parameters / recipes
* Following other users

We're still hammering out a few bugs on Android but can look forward to that release soon!

What are some features you'd like to see added?

Thanks for all the support so far and please keep the feedback coming,

**Latest Filings** (excluding insider transactions)

**September 26, 2025 - ARS: Annual Report to Security Holders Open document**

**2025 Annual Report Fiscal Year ended May 31, 2025**

To My Fellow Stockholders, 

I am honored to have this opportunity to reflect on Tilray Brands‚Äô remarkable progress and achievements with you. Our 2025 fiscal year was one marked by significant advancements, bold innovation, and strategic growth. We have transformed Tilray Brands into a global company at the intersection of cannabis, beverage and wellness, establishing ourselves as a leading global cannabis business, the fourth largest craft beer producer in the U.S., and a dominant force in the global market for high-protein hemp foods, snacks and wellness drinks. Our progress is rooted in a deep understanding of product innovation and evolving consumer demands, shaping offerings that not only reflect, but anticipate, how people choose to eat, drink, relax, and address their health and wellbeing. 

In Fiscal 2025, we achieved record total net revenue of $821 million, or $834 million on a constant currency basis, and delivered our highest gross profit to date of $241 million. We also ended the year with $256 million in cash and marketable securities and reduced total debt by roughly $100 million, strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing strategic flexibility. Our financial performance highlights the value of our disciplined strategy to enhance profitability, drive innovation, and reinforce long-term shareholder returns. Throughout the fiscal year, I am proud to share that Tilray‚Äôs cannabis operations achieved significant milestones and demonstrated meaningful progress. 

**We strengthened our leadership across international markets, including notable advances in Germany following medical cannabis reform. Our Aphria RX operations in Germany secured new cultivation and trading licenses, further fortifying our cannabis supply chain and expanding our medical cannabis portfolio with brands such as Broken Coast, Tilray Craft, and the latest, Good Supply. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, we received Italy‚Äôs first authorization to distribute medical cannabis flower for therapeutic use from the Italian Ministry of Health and formed a strategic partnership with the Italian Pharmaceutical firm, Molteni, to broaden the availability of our cannabis extracts to patients there. These efforts enabled us to serve more patients and pharmacies across Europe and reinforced Tilray‚Äôs reputation as a trusted partner for patients, healthcare professionals, and governments worldwide. As international regulations continue to evolve, these achievements lay a solid foundation for future growth.**

**In the United States, ongoing discussions continue regarding advancements in the legalization and the rescheduling of cannabis, with significant developments anticipated in the near future. Rescheduling is projected to enhance patient access, improve the quality of patient care, promote scientific research, and support responsible regulatory practices. As a recognized leader in medical cannabis, trusted by patients, healthcare professionals, and governments across more than 20 countries, Tilray is strategically positioned to capitalize on this unique opportunity by leveraging our diversified platform and extensive experience in developing new medical cannabis markets. Our proven track record in market development enables us to respond swiftly and effectively to regulatory changes in the U.S., whether these occur in the coming months or in subsequent years**. 

In Canada, Tilray accelerated cannabis innovation across our leading brands in Fiscal Year 2025, reinforcing our position as a product-driven company attuned to evolving consumer preferences. On the cannabis flower side, Broken Coast elevated our premium portfolio with new, high-quality strains such as Coffee Creamer, prized for its unique flavor and terpene complexity. Redecan launched live-resin infused pre-rolls, while Good Supply rolled out potent new formats like Double Dutchies and kief-coated infused pre-rolls, offering exceptional strength, flavor, and consistency. These next-generation products quickly became some of the fastest-growing offerings in Canada, and with our value-based pricing, cemented **Tilray‚Äôs leadership as the #1 market share leader of non-infused pre-rolls in Canada.** In cannabis vapes and concentrates, we launched high-potency, flavor-forward formulations across several brands, including innovative terpene blends and live-resin options to meet the increasing demand for premium, full-spectrum experiences. Sour enthusiasts have embraced the launch of our XMG Atomic Sours sub-brand, which now features XMG Atomic Sours Beverages and our first XMG gummy products. 

These advancements reflect our ongoing commitment to product differentiation, scientific innovation, and consumer-first design. Collectively, these innovations highlight Tilray‚Äôs unwavering leadership in innovative product development and consumer engagement,ensuring that we remain at the forefront of industry trends and are well-positioned to drive continued growth and value for our stakeholders. 

**To support these initiatives, we have implemented AI-driven horticulture automation across cultivation, enhancing potency, purity, and yield efficiency. This ensures we deliver the highest-quality products to market while maintaining cost discipline and strengthening our margins.**

**In our beverage segment, we successfully completed the acquisition of four iconic craft beer brands from Molson Coors‚ÄîHop Valley Brewing, Terrapin Beer, Revolver Brewing, and Atwater Brewery. This strategic move, combined with the eight AB InBev brands we acquired in Fiscal 2024, has significantly broadened our beverage portfolio and established Tilray as the fourth-largest craft beer producer in the United States.** 

The integration of these brands is a cornerstone of Project 420, our initiative to optimize beverage operations, drive profitable growth, and capitalize on portfolio synergies for enhanced marketing and supply chain efficiency. **We believe that Project 420 will be critical to our success in fiscal year 2026, allowing us to create a more streamlined and profitable craft beer and beverage platform.** 

I remain committed to ensuring we maximize the benefits of these acquisitions. 

**This fiscal year, we also introduced hemp-derived Delta-9 (HD-D9) THC beverages in the U.S.‚Äîa breakthrough category expansion that leverages our beverage infrastructure to bring innovative, hemp-derived drinks to mainstream retailers. Early consumer adoption and strong feedback signal the transformative potential of this category within the beverage sector.**

**Today, Tilray generates revenue in more than 20 countries and proudly operates over 40 distinct brands across cannabis, beverages, and wellness categories.** With our diversified global platform, we are uniquely positioned at the forefront of these growth industries, shaping their future with vision, scale, and purpose. Our overall strategy is to harness our brands, infrastructure, and expertise to drive growth, profitability, and lasting shareholder value. We continue to strengthen our capabilities in data analytics and consumer insights to lead in category management, identify new product opportunities, and expand into additional markets. Maintaining cost discipline and a strong financial position remains a priority. Our seasoned leadership team‚Äîbringing together a proven track record in cannabis, beverages, and wellness‚Äîare dedicated to executing this vision and ensuring Tilray‚Äôs continued success as a global leader at the intersection of cannabis, beverage, wellness, and entertainment.

# Looking forward, our strategic priorities remain clear:

1. **Build global brands** that lead in their respective industries across the cannabis, beverages and wellness categories by winning the hearts and minds of our consumers and patients. Our unwavering commitment is to build global brands that set the standard for excellence in cannabis, beverages, and wellness, earning the trust and loyalty of consumers and patients worldwide. We are proud to steward a portfolio of high-quality brands that resonate deeply with the individuals we serve‚Äîbrands that are not only recognized for their superior quality but also cherished and relied upon by our global community. Through ongoing innovation and a relentless focus on delivering exceptional value, we will continue to strengthen this loyalty, ensuring that our consumers and patients receive the consistent quality and unique value proposition they expect from Tilray Brands.
2. **Advance cannabis research** and innovation and change the way the world consumes cannabis. We will continue to develop innovative, differentiated products that drive consumer demand, while optimizing our cultivation and production facilities. Guided by research and insights, we are investing in innovation to deliver a portfolio of products that meets consumer needs and consistently exceeds their expectations.
3. **Grow and optimize our beverage business.** We are dedicated to completing the integration of Tilray Beverages while placing a strong emphasis on profitable growth. Our goal is to create a more efficient and profitable beverage platform through an optimized product mix, heightened marketing effectiveness, and increased supply-chain efficiency. In addition to these efforts, Tilray is launching innovative beverage products that resonate with consumers seeking non-traditional beer experiences. **By introducing new styles, unique flavor profiles, and expanding into adjacent beverage categories‚Äîsuch as our non-alcoholic beer brand, Runner‚Äôs High, sparking water, energy drinks, and HD-D9 THC drinks‚Äîwe are meeting the evolving preferences of modern consumers who crave originality and variety beyond conventional brews. These initiatives position Tilray at the forefront of beverage innovation, capturing growth opportunities and driving greater consumer engagement within the segment.**
4. **Expand and grow wellness** and better-for-you platforms. Tilray will look to expand its Wellness segment in Fiscal 2026, both in wellness and functional foods and beverages. We will continue to diversify and expand the Manitoba Harvest portfolio in North America in better-for-you and high-protein categories and begin to bring the brand into new international markets. **We see the success of Hi-Ball as validation that Tilray Wellness has the right strategy, infrastructure and expertise to build and acquire a more broad-based wellness beverage portfolio. In regions like Asia, the Middle East, India, and T√ºrkiye we will focus on strategic opportunities in non-alcoholic beer and hemp-based food.**
5. **Execute with discipline and technology. We are deploying data, automation, and AI across cultivation and operations to raise quality, reduce waste, and speed innovation for operational excellence.**

In closing, I want to express my gratitude to Tilray‚Äôs dedicated global team, our Board of Directors, our partners, and our investors for your support and commitment. Together, we are building something extraordinary, and I am confident that the best is yet to come.

Please continue to support Tilray Brands and your investment in the Company by voting today on the proposals and matters outlined in the 2025 Proxy Statement, and join us at the Annual

**Meeting of Stockholders to be held on Tuesday, November 18, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. EST.**

On Sunday my husband is really good about taking the kids for a few hours or some times most of the day so I can do my own thing.

Just this morning I forced myself to get in the car to walk my dog on the beach. I got to the beach, saw it was crowded and parking was going to be a pain so I literally turned around and went home. And I type this while I lay in bed while husband has the kids.

CHAPTER 1:Very Strange Neighbors

1st of July
5:59 AMSerenity Gardens: ‚ÄúA Little Slice of Eden‚Äù

Doug Dillard enjoyed the feeling of the cool grass blades on his bare feet. He scrunched his toes, and then wiggled them, really focusing on the tactile sensation of his skin on the soggy lawn.

‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶this isn‚Äôt half bad‚Ä¶‚Äù he muttered aloud in a weak voice.

It was early morning, and the grass still had a chilly coating of dew gathered in little droplets on the husky green blades. A light mist clung to the ground, and the neighborhood was nearly silent save for the chirping of a few tiny birds one yard over.¬†¬†

Doug stood there alone on the grass wearing a light gray bathrobe, and blue and white flannel pajama pants. He was a svelte man with a mop of disheveled blonde hair and a frizzed-out mustache. On this morning, he was looking defeated and drained of life with big weary bags under his bleary eyes, and a healthy crop of stubble adorning his weak jaw.

He gripped a white mug of piping hot coffee in his left hand that read ‚ÄúHappy 40th!‚Äù in big gold letters with a cartoon sun broadcasting cheerful rays. It was a thoughtful gift from Shelly at the office yesterday. Turns out the mug was only halfway true: as of 3:33 this morning Douglas Dillard was in fact 40 years old.¬†
The ‚ÄúHappy‚Äù part however‚Ä¶
Well‚Ä¶

Last night when he got home from work a nuclear bomb was dropped on his life.
This bomb and the radioactive fallout were the reason why he was standing in the yard barefoot at the ass-crack of dawn.

Todd, his old therapist, had called it ‚Äúearthing‚Äù. It‚Äôs something you could do to soothe your shattered nervous system. A kind of natural reboot of your body‚Äôs energies he said‚Äîdrawing healing power directly from the earth right up through the soles of your feet.¬†

Doug closed his eyes and continued to knead his toes into the wet lawn. This was central Florida, so the grass was thick and meaty; little green spikes that prickled the soles of his feet. The prickling was good: it did something to distract him from the sinking ball of anxiety bubbling in his guts.

Last night was nothing but tossing and turning: a sweaty mass of tangled sheets and feverish dreams. The thrashing had turned his hair into a tangled mass of blonde tufts shooting in fifty different directions.¬†

It‚Äôs amazing the effect a few words can have on a man.

Last night all he did was pick up the phone.¬†
He picked up the phone and his wife Janet spoke.¬†

(1) I dropped off bags in the AM and told them to hold downstairs. When I came back for the keys I said let me grab my bag and was hand waved and told it was upstairs. I said that‚Äôs weird bc I wanted it down here, but got more hand wave. Okay, so I take the elevator up and voila of course it‚Äôs not there. Go back downstairs and pick up my bag. 

(2) Day 1 - Yay! I enjoy the stupid free water perk. Day 2 - come back. No water. Not a hill I need to die on. Tap is good in Madrid. Day 3 - the drought continues 

(3) Day 3 - Come back and notice no coffee pods. First day I had 1 decaf/3caf and drank them all. Day 2 weirdly 3 decaf/1 caf. Whatever I drink it all - I like a warm bev. Day 3 - no pods. I call down and they tell me that coffee isn‚Äôt included in my room but that they‚Äôll send some up. I was flabbergasted. So coffee machine is an amenity but coffee is not? Why did I have pods the prior two days? Just dumb.

1. Time it right. My city now has pretty much one month that's not too hot, not too cold, and not rainy. So, we've switched to only camping in October, and we've had perfect camping weather both times.

2. Find special camping opportunities. We're members of an arboretum that has members-only camping twice a year. They have a special toddler craft, nature talks, water coolers, a playground, and actual restrooms. Last year, they even had a food truck and craft beer cart for parents. Plus morning coffee. It is SO much easier than traditional camping.

3. You don't need screens, and you barely need toys. We've never brought screens to our toddler camping trips. We brought two books, bubbles, and one stuffie. My daughter had so fun watching turtles off the dock that she barely asked for toys!

4. Bring so many snacks. That's it.

5. Not a tip, just encouragement: you might actually (almost) sleep! My daughter hadn't woken up after 5:45 in two months, but she slept until nearly 7:00 today. Sleeping outside might shake your toddler out of a rough sleep habit.

I'm so excited that we've had two memorable trips, so let me know if you have any questions about taking your toddler camping!",3,1759685457.0,toddlers,0,1.0,False

As brief as I can get 
met hubby 11 years ago, I lived SW Scotland wth my parents, he lived Central Scotland, his parents lived E Scotland. We married 2015. I‚Äôm now 42 he‚Äôs 46.
I was close with my parents, he wasn‚Äôt close with his and rarely spoke to them. Not out of dislike but just not close.
I was hubbys first gf (he‚Äôs firmly on the spectrum but won‚Äôt admit it) but I‚Äôd had plenty serious relationships so I led ours.

When I met hubby I tended to go to him because he didn‚Äôt drive, I met his parents who it seemed were okay. His mum had the beginnings of dementia so convo was mostly with his dad.
When we got up to leave, his dad went to give me a hug. Ok I‚Äôm a hugger so accepted it. Then he gave me a big wet kiss - I thought it was going to be on the cheek so accepted it (I‚Äôm of the age when you‚Äôre extra polite to prospective in-laws). However he twisted at the last minute and landed his lips on mine. I twisted the other way but his lips made contact briefly. I backed away from him and was so shocked i didn‚Äôt say anything. He didn‚Äôt say anything either and hubby didn‚Äôt see properly. I‚Äôd said oh your dad kissed me but hubby was like oh I dunno I didn‚Äôt see it and sort of brushed it aside. I kept blaming myself, I thought maybe I‚Äôve moved the wrong way or something 
But it keeps happening.
His dad didn‚Äôt spend much time with us so that was fine, I thought oh I‚Äôll just avoid him because I‚Äôd fallen in love with hubby. 

There‚Äôs been a couple of times where FIL has been rude and pushy 
- he and MIL were due to have lunch with my parents and us, at the last minute my dad called to say sorry I‚Äôm not very well but I‚Äôve got (my mum) dressed etc so she can go. FIL pushed his way into my parents house saying oh your dad is older than me I want to meet him before he goes. Now at the time dad was fine he just had a tummy bug.
- Once we got engaged and had booked the wedding, my dad was diagnosed with a brain tumour and not given long to live. We brought the wedding forward and my dad was determined to walk me down the aisle. Part of the aisle was down a sweeping set of stairs. FIL offered at the last minute to walk me down the aisle but dad said no. So FIL walked right behind us like an odd maid of honour - almost every photo of my dad and I walking down the stairs FIL is in
- On our mini honeymoon he called hubby (fine, because my dad was ill I called twice a day every day) and asked to speak to me (making a point of saying can I speak to MRS ‚Ä¶.) Hubby said no she‚Äôs in the bath, FIL sounded outraged saying ‚Äòwhy‚Äôs she in the bath‚Äô like it‚Äôs abnormal or something (or maybe a creepy connotation?)

All my family and my MIL have now passed, I‚Äôve been cognisant of the fact that FIL is now alone so encourage hubby to call him often especially as FIL doesn‚Äôt have friends 

Fast forward to November 2022, I fell very ill after a medical malpractice and became disabled due to neurological damage causing me to have very poor balance, spent 2023 and most of 2024 in bed/a wheelchair but decided to fight tooth and nail to get better after the following incident. My speech as well as my balance has been affected (basically I seem drunk all the time).
Hubbys been my carer up until February this year. My condition means that I can‚Äôt coordinate myself - if I‚Äôm walking and a noisy bus goes past I have to stop or I‚Äôll lose my balance. 

Now hubbys never been good at housework, he says I‚Äôm mentally ill because if there‚Äôs stuff on the floor I‚Äôll pick it up or clean it, I have flaws too. He‚Äôll do very basic things like if there‚Äôs dirty dishes or clothes he‚Äôll clean them eventually but not mop floors etc. we had two cats and dog so needs done regularly. For a few years it was just me doing that while he was at cinema or watching tv. While I cared for my family.

I told hubby to invite FIL for Xmas 2024 because I was feeling a little bit better, I‚Äôd managed to do stuff in the house and it was like ‚ÄòI want to get back to normal‚Äô. Also FIL is on his own, I feel sorry for him and because hubby is both on the spectrum and generally not close with his dad (I‚Äôve asked his childhood friends and they said they didn‚Äôt see any issues and that hubby was spoiled).
House looked great, even though I had to literally crawl to clean stuff, I‚Äôd done it. 
Hubby went to go collect FIL on the 23rd, he was getting stuff out the car and FIL strode in the door and said ‚Äòhi, I‚Äôd forgotten how bad it was in here‚Äô. Now FILs house is dirty, he has a cleaner but he has so much tat everywhere (hoarder level) he can‚Äôt shower to the extent he‚Äôs had a constant leg infection. He‚Äôs got papers and magazines piled in there.
I stammered a bit and burst into tears. Hubby came in and I spoke to him, he said ‚ÄòI told him (FIL) not to say anything about the house‚Äô. But my anger is why say to the ill disabled person when there‚Äôs an able bodied man there who doesn‚Äôt work (in fact hasn‚Äôt worked since before we got married because we lived off my parents estates - this wasn‚Äôt agreed because I didn‚Äôt plan on inheriting what I did, he got depressed and I was busy caring for my family and then grieving and unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have a lot of me left to be able to deal with him too). IMO the person to speak to would be the one who was the carer.

Got worse from there
So we ate dinner, at bedtime I went up early (hubby and I have separate bedrooms) and halfway through the night I woke to hear footsteps then heavy breathing outside my closed door. I don‚Äôt think he was doing anything other than just standing there but still ü§¢ I asked hubby to ask him the next morning if he needed anything because I was a very light sleeper and was getting woken up. I‚Äôll admit I wanted him to know that I knew he was there and now hubby did. He had a tv in there, blankets, the option to take a flask etc so no reason (the toilet is between the spare room and my room).

Xmas day was ‚Äòok‚Äô, our friend came over for dinner and would chat with anyone but was regaled with stories of FIL and his exploits in the TA - ie that he was in it not that he was wandering around exotic locales - or that he was a baggage handler in Heathrow. Now our friend is super nice but he‚Äôs very very well travelled and intelligent and used to be an archaeologist so super interesting. I‚Äôve always known that conversation is between more than one person and hadn‚Äôt realised how FIL was until then. The last couple of months I‚Äôve realised he knows nothing about me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve led quite an interesting life, had various jobs, lived and worked abroad, had a famous-ish uncle who was famous in Scotland. But he knows nothing about me at all. 
Our friend spent the whole of Xmas day just listening to FIL‚Ä¶..as in if you offer FIL tea he says il have it xyz because that‚Äôs how we had it in the TA‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 

Anyway the next day he says can he go home it‚Äôs his first time staying away and he misses home. Hubby says ok but we say can we talk first. And it‚Äôs about he needs to shower etc and eat properly etc etc. (his legs been infected for a couple of years because he won‚Äôt shower - his excuses are both that there‚Äôs stuff in there and that he can‚Äôt get his hernia wet - we‚Äôve checked with the doctor and this is a lie, he can shower he just chooses to use a dirty flannel). 
Halfway through I need to go to the toilet so I get hubbys help. Hubby was sat on the arm of the sofa , facing FIL, I turn my back to FIL (tight gap but only way to get past) hold hubbys hand to sidestep past. Fine, on way way back though I do the same because I had a lowish cut long dress on and didn‚Äôt want to give him an eyeful. This time he puts his hands on my waist, I‚Äôm so busy concentrating because I keep thinking I can‚Äôt fall on FIL, he THEN slides his hands over my hips to cup my buttocks 
I manage to get past and tbh I‚Äôm so in shock I flop onto the sofa mute.
My brains still processing this and it‚Äôs time to take FIL home, I sit in the back seat and pretend to sleep because I‚Äôm so shaken. We get back to the east coast and FIL says bye and gets out I‚Äôm still pretending to be asleep. When he goes into the house I get out and go to the front seat, he sees me, comes rushing out the house and hugs me and kisses me on the lips. I push him off and hubbys just says daaaaaaad and rolls his eyes like oh I don‚Äôt know what to do or say - he‚Äôs always done this even though I‚Äôve said it‚Äôs upsetting me.

We get home and I try to tell hubby about the groping but whether he‚Äôs not understanding my speech, choosing not to understand or what he just says ‚Äòbut I told him to stop‚Äô - referring to the kiss. No matter what I say he doesn‚Äôt hear that it‚Äôs a different instance.

This goes on for literally months I‚Äôve told friends who are horrified and tell me to tell hubby but I can‚Äôt get it through to him. 

Other things happen- I‚Äôve got marked as mentally stable (had enacted power of Attorney but to get it removed I had to prove I‚Äôm able to deal with it myself) and got back driving. This has kind of pushed myself to get better and now I mainly walk with a stick, plus my stamina is better.

In MARCH I basically have a meltdown because i saw a police programme where they‚Äôre called for a customer doing that to a barmaid - I have a freakout, scream what his dad did and somehow hubby finally gets it. But then says well I don‚Äôt know what to do about it. 
I said call him now and speak to him because if you don‚Äôt I will.
He ums and ahs and says it‚Äôs not the sort of thing you say over the phone, I have to say it in person.
So I say go get in the car now. 
He ends up going the next day and his dad says I don‚Äôt remember ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è hubby then says (at my request) she doesn‚Äôt want to see or speak to you anymore and that‚Äôs that.

I tried to tell hubby that I was stupidly initially concerned his dad had dementia or if he tried to do it to someone else, now it‚Äôs sunk in yes I‚Äôm angry and hurt and disgusted. Hubby touches my backside affectionately and I have a meltdown, the other night was our anniversary, we tried to be romantic but every time he kissed me I saw his dads greasy slobbering lips and with hubbys spectrum issue he won‚Äôt take it the way I need him to. It‚Äôs gotten so bad I can‚Äôt stop thinking if I‚Äôd had a short skirt on, FIL would have tried to get inside my knickers ü§¢

I feel better mentally now - a little - BUT hubby (although he‚Äôs now working) still gets gifts of money from his dad as he did before, so I think if he‚Äôs not going to refuse it, the least he can do is to check he‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs not up to me to say he‚Äôs to push away HIS family and FIL is the only direct family we have. So I remind him to call.
The other day he says (after I‚Äôve said to be polite I hope your dad‚Äôs well) dad says he‚Äôs hoping you‚Äôre okay and he misses saying hi etc.
Now I‚Äôve been pushing myself really hard and and a lot better than I was, I can speak a little better and my mobility is better and improving. 
I‚Äôve said to hubby I want us all to go for a coffee but I don‚Äôt want the subject brought up. I want this I think because I‚Äôm doing things MY way IYCWIM, if I‚Äôm afraid of something I tackle it straight on now, and I‚Äôm refusing to be afraid of him. I don‚Äôt want to hear his excuses or more likely blame (hel maybe say oh your bum landed on my hands or something stupid like I was just supporting you) and I want to feel strong. I‚Äôm not into arguing i absolutely wouldn‚Äôt start a fight and I just want to face my fears, and probably as well show him that I know and knew what was going on around me and that I‚Äôm better. Maybe to give him a cool look in the eyes so he knows I‚Äôm not afraid.
Hubby says no.

I see part of me is angry at FIL, part is upset that hubby didn‚Äôt ‚Äòhear‚Äô me and stand up for me straight away.

What do I do? Who‚Äôs in the right? AITA?

1nyud2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1nyud2n/should_you_buy_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Compact,"Testing the Keurig 5000376527 K-Compact Coffee Maker over the past few weeks has been an aromatic journey. As someone who cannot face the day without a solid cup of coffee, I felt it was high time to try this compact single-serve machine. At first glance, the minimalist black design and compact construction seemed to promise practicality, but digging deeper revealed a machine built for simplicity and convenience, with both strengths and slight shortcomings that deserve attention.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact footprint of this coffee maker is a game changer for smaller kitchens, as it measures just 8.2 inches in width, leaving plenty of counter space untouched. Its modern, matte-black finish gives it a sleek, understated charm that blends well into almost any kitchen setting. The build feels sturdy, though not overly hefty. At 7.85 pounds, it‚Äôs light enough to move around but doesn't feel flimsy. I tried fitting the machine into a friend‚Äôs studio apartment kitchenette last week, and it slotted in seamlessly without cluttering the space. The removable drip tray is another thoughtful touch, accommodating taller travel mugs without issue.

**Ease of Operation**  
Operating this coffee maker is incredibly simple, which is perfect for hectic mornings when you just need your caffeine fix‚Äîfast. The intuitive button control panel requires no learning curve. You pop in a K-Cup, press the brew-size button, and voila, coffee is ready in less than a minute! I especially appreciated the Smart Start feature that heats and brews in one go. Compared to other coffee makers I‚Äôve tested, skipping the heat-then-brew step is a subtle but impactful time-saver for groggy mornings.

[Ready to buy Keurig 5000376527? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b0bv9hkmnt/)

**Brewing Performance**  
In terms of brewing, the Keurig K-Compact delivers precisely what it promises: consistency. Whether crafting a 6-ounce, 8-ounce, or 10-ounce cup, the machine never stumbles. I noticed the 6-ounce size produces the most robust flavor, while the 10-ounce brew offers a lighter-bodied kick. Another bonus is the machine‚Äôs ability to dispense hot water on demand, which was handy when I wanted a quick mug of tea or to make instant oatmeal. However, I did notice that brewing with certain pods sometimes led to slight leakage, requiring cleanup under the pod holder.

**Strengths**  
‚Ä¢ Space-saving design perfect for compact kitchens  
‚Ä¢ Simple one-minute brewing process  
‚Ä¢ Smart Start feature reduces prep time  
‚Ä¢ Accommodates travel mugs with adjustable drip tray  
‚Ä¢ Energy-efficient auto-off function saves power  

**Weaknesses**  
‚Ä¢ No reusable My K-Cup filter included (sold separately)  
‚Ä¢ Occasionally leaks small amounts of water during brewing  
‚Ä¢ Limited to three brew size options  

**Energy Efficiency**  
The automatic shut-off function, which powers down the device two hours after the last brew, is a practical feature, not only for safety reasons but also for energy conservation. I‚Äôve been guilty of leaving appliances on for hours, but this Keurig puts my forgetfulness at ease. It‚Äôs these small details that make this product ideal for multitaskers.

**Competing Products**  
When compared to alternatives like the Nespresso Essenza Mini or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Keurig K-Compact holds its ground as a strong contender. The Essenza Mini might have an edge when it comes to taste quality and aesthetics, but it‚Äôs pricier and relies exclusively on its own branded pods. Meanwhile, the FlexBrew offers versatility with its dual brewing mechanisms (pods and ground coffee) but takes up much more counter space, which might be a dealbreaker for small kitchens. The K-Compact, with its quick setup and ability to brew hundreds of K-Cup pod types, strikes a sweet balance for those who prioritize simplicity and functionality.

**True Value**  
In terms of value for its features, this coffee maker offers affordable quality, especially if you‚Äôre pressed for space yet keen on brewing convenience. Other compact models often compromise on water reservoir size or brew settings, but the K-Compact gets it right with its 36-ounce removable tank that allows for multiple brews. The versatility of being able to brew tea, hot chocolate, or iced beverages without having to learn complicated settings is a big win in its favor. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option out there, the convenience it packs is worth every penny for a single-serve brewer.

1nyucju,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1nyucju/why_do_thoughts_i_have_no_desire_for_manifest/,Why do thoughts I have no desire for manifest?,"I have a series of manifestations that have come true- but these vary from being passing thoughts I don‚Äôt even wish for, to things I actively want. 

I don‚Äôt understand the distinction, so if someone could help me understand why certain random thoughts manifest, and others don‚Äôt (ones I actively decide I want to manifest) that would be great.

Some examples: 

1) ACTIVE DESIRE- I was at a festival. A group of boys were in front of me, and one boy was called over by his friends (fake name) ‚ÄúHey John!!!‚Äù, which is the same name as a guy I had been deeply infatuated with for a couple of years. I thought to myself- he‚Äôs going to put me on his shoulders, and after a few minutes a random girl asked to go on his shoulders and I let it go, thinking, maybe that wasn‚Äôt meant for me. But then immediately after he turns to me- NO CONVO- and asks if I want to go on his shoulders. This is an example of where something I actively wanted manifested. 

2) NO DESIRE- I was on the train and saw an old man who looked exactly like a guy I used to date over a year before. We hadn‚Äôt spoken at all and had both clearly moved on- he didn‚Äôt ever cross my mind and I didn‚Äôt care for him at all. All I thought was ‚ÄòOh that guy looks exactly how *John* will look in 40 years lol‚Äô. So odd but HOURS later *John* messages me- which was so beyond out of the blue and I NEVER thought about him apart from this particular instance of me seeing the old man who looked like him.

1nyuaym,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nyuaym/my_28m_girlfriend_27f_broke_up_with_me_for/,My 28m girlfriend 27f broke up with me for unclear reasons to me at least.,"Background: gf (27f) and I (28m) met over a year ago when we shared two classes together at junior college. It took a while but we eventually started talking on Snapchat and things seemed to really click. About a year ago I finally asked her to get coffee with a few of my friends and a few of her friends so everyone felt comfortable. Things went really well tbh so a little while later I asked her on a 1 on 1 date to take a walk and watch the sunset together. We kept dating since then until recently. More Backround: I am a US citizen. She is a German girl who is studying here in the US and lives with a host family on a student visa. She currently works as a nanny for another family and works Monday- Friday before and after her classes at school, so we only have time for dates on weekends. Over the year I had met her host family, kids she nanny‚Äôs, and knew of her family in Germany. I also met many of her friends as well as her meeting my friends and family. Everything seamed really good and it felt like she was really into me.

Two month ago at the end of summer we decided to take a trip together to Boston and it was very fun. We had a blast with all the historical stuff and museums and she tease me by saying things like ‚Äúoh this is what Americans call historical? My train station is older than this.‚Äù The only thing I could say that wasn‚Äôt as I expected was just the few times we were intimate at night, but that may just be me being a man. Outside of that we held hands and kissed and did everything a couple does such as breakfast and dinner together at nice places ect. Things were great after for about a month, but the last month she started to seem a little distant but I chalked it up to school starting and how hard of a schedule she had this semester as well as many other small things that were really tough on her. She doubled down on her workout plan and I could tell with everything else she was very overwhelmed.

On to the potential crux of the issue. I take things slow in the sense of long term decisions such as marriage. I was at the point where I could defiantly see myself marrying her even though it may have been difficult with family abroad. I however communicated that marriage was quite a few years out if anything as I would want to date someone for a few years and live together before proposing and we both were in no hurry. I also want kids but realize it may be harder for me to be in a financial situation I felt comfortable with to have kids due to my chosen career path which I am at school for. So to be short, I want kids but don‚Äôt have to have kids. My girlfriend at the time did not want to have kids. That was never a deal breaker for me as I understand her view as well as her essentially raising another families kids as their nanny. I also understand that peoples minds such as my own may change with age and situations that occur. Although we occasionally chirped about children, we never properly sat down and had a conversation about it.

A few weeks ago she ended up breaking up with me when we met up. Her main reason was that our futures are not aligned and something just felt off for her. She used the famous line ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me.‚Äù For as understanding and cordial as the breakup was, it really left me with a lot of un answered questions and little closure in my opinion.

We are not talking right now, which really pains me, but it was a mutual decision to take some time off from talking. I am a very understanding and forgiving person so a part of me would want to get back together if she wanted after a proper discussion of what went wrong and what we need to fix to make our relationship work. The other parts of me is confused and doesn‚Äôt know what to do as this was my first longer relationship in a long time.

Any advise is greatly appreciated. Questions for ladies would be: can you provide any insight into what ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me‚Äù means and if you have been in a similar scenarios. Men: what is some advice to either move on or attempt a reconciliation. Also men, please don‚Äôt recommend ‚Äúrecreational‚Äù relationships as that‚Äôs not something I prefer.

The first time Finn repeated something that hadn‚Äôt happened yet, I dropped my mug.

‚ÄúHe looks so peaceful now,‚Äù he said from his crib, voice small, clear, precise. I hadn‚Äôt spoken the words yet. Not ever.

The specialist called it echolalia‚Äîa developmental delay where a child mirrors sounds instead of creating them. I called it adorable. Finn was three. Everything he said was a perfect echo.

‚ÄúHot coffee, please,‚Äù if a stranger ordered nearby.
‚ÄúLove you too,‚Äù if I hung up the phone.

At first, it was charming. Endearing even. Until the words started coming from inside the apartment.

‚ÄúHush, darling, it‚Äôs just the pipe,‚Äù he whispered in John‚Äôs exact tone. John, snoring beside me.
‚ÄúThe screws are loose on the bannister,‚Äù he told his toy bear, my own words from last week. But the bannister was tight, solid‚ÄîJohn had fixed it.

I began recording him at night, notebook beside the crib, listening for patterns. His voice wasn‚Äôt random; it was chronological. The apartment itself was speaking through him.

Last night, I left a digital recorder by the crib. My hands shook as I pressed record and went back to bed. The first hour passed with only Finn‚Äôs soft breaths. Then came a scrape, wet and dragging, across the hardwood floor. A grunt, low, deliberate, too close to be anything outside the nursery.

I froze the playback. Finn slept. His tiny chest rising and falling like it had for three years.

Then his voice came, calm and unnerving:
‚ÄúNo, Finn, let go of the wire.‚Äù

My stomach dropped. The tape captured a muffled struggle. A dragging. A crack‚Äîelectric, final.

I fast-forwarded. Forty-five minutes of silence followed.

Then, soft, unmistakable, Finn‚Äôs voice again:
‚ÄúHe looks so peaceful now.‚Äù

I froze. My breath caught. My hand hovered over the recorder.

The apartment fell silent.

Until the baby monitor clicked.

A whisper hissed through the static. A tiny, deliberate breath.

And Finn‚Äôs voice:
‚ÄúHot coffee, please.‚Äù

But it wasn‚Äôt Finn this time. It was me.

I leaned closer to the crib. Finn was asleep, pale and serene. His chest rose and fell with nothing to disturb it. Yet somewhere in the apartment, the echo continued‚Äîrepeating, learning, waiting. The house wasn‚Äôt just a home. It was a mouth. And through my son, it had found a voice.

I shut the monitor. Tried to breathe.

The recorder clicked on again by itself.

I‚Äôve been trying to get better at brewing espresso and I‚Äôm encountering something that I can‚Äôt quite figure out the issue for. 

For the most part, both the grinder and brewer have been very good. I especially love the grinder since I drink other types of coffee besides espresso. However, I've been having issues keeping my espresso brewing consistent. I'll admit that I have not officially ""dialed in"" the machine and instead just use the default double shot that is programmed with it. However, I'm not sure that alone is the issue, as I'm sure plenty of people use it without any problems. Especially if they have a particular set of beans they prefer.

I‚Äôm using Nossa Familia Italian blend and grinding at about a 20. I‚Äôm grinding 17 grams of beans and this is producing \~44 grams of espresso. This ratio is off and I‚Äôve never been able to get it better than this. I've tried various water temps, various grind variations, tried being as consistent as possible with tamp pressure, and various amounts of beans (ranging from 16 grams to almost 19 grams). If I grind finder, I find that I get channeling. If I grind coarser, I get that dreaded sour taste. I also find that grinding more that about 17.5 grams of beans leads to the portafilter being too full and a good amount of the grounds falling out either during the tamping process or during the sort of ""clean up"" process where any excess grounds are cleaned off the edges. I do spray the beans with a little water before grinding to prevent static from flinging it everywhere, but I'm not sure if that is affecting my ability to properly tamper the grounds. 

I'm debating getting a tamper that is spring loaded so it exerts the correct pressure every time, but I thought I would ask the advice of y'all to see if you can recommend something that I'm not thinking of. I like the ""semi-automatic"" double shot setting being easy, but obviously I can't rely on every set of beans I purchase playing as nicely with it. But I regularly purchase Nossa Familia since I really like the taste of it, and that is where I have most of my espresso brewing experience. I make sure the roast date is within a month of when I purchase it. ",2,1759684940.0,espresso,10,1.0,False

1nyu2d6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nyu2d6,I did a Remco and pulled out of the race of the year,"Not the post I thought I‚Äôd be writing. But if I‚Äôm going to share my wins, I owe it to the process to share the losses too‚Äîon the off chance someone out there might learn from my missteps. What follows isn‚Äôt a list of excuses, but a cautionary tale of ‚Äúwhat not to do.‚Äù

The week leading up to Triman was anything but smooth. I suspect the universe got triggered during my final brick session.
I was pushing a decent effort on the Speedmax. I‚Äôve been training on the TT bike for about a month, clocked just under 1000km, but calling myself a seasoned time trialist would be generous at best. On a stretch of road I could ride blindfolded, disaster struck. In aero position, visibility is limited, and I must‚Äôve been flying off a descent when I hit the carcass of a badger (yes, the same one that‚Äôs been there for two months). Front wheel met fur, and I hit the ground like a sack of bricks.
Bike first, then body‚Äîcyclists know the drill. The Speedmax looked okay. I looked okay-ish. Some road rash, but nothing dramatic. I called Mia: ‚ÄúHey babe, I crashed pretty hard, but I‚Äôm alright. No need to worry.‚Äù Adrenaline masked the shoulder pain that would later make aero position impossible. From that point on, all cycling was done indoors on my endurance bike. Tapering was already planned, so I focused on sweet spot intervals. Shoulder felt sore, but manageable. I could still swim, bike, and run.

Later that week, Mia arrived from her hometown, and my mom flew in from Belgium. We spent a few lovely days in Sofia, carb-loading like pros‚Äîpasta, pizza, pastries galore‚Äîbefore heading to Olympic Beach.
The trip to Greece? A comedy of errors. No license, no car (something I‚Äôm finally going to fix), so we booked with a company whose name I won‚Äôt mention‚Äîbut they run green buses. You know the ones. Departure was set for 6PM. By 7:45, still no bus. No info. Around 8:45, we finally left Sofia. Got held up at the border over a passport issue I didn‚Äôt quite follow. Instead of arriving at 11PM, we stumbled into our accommodation at 3:45AM‚Äîexhausted, hungry, and broken. Thankfully, our host had left the keys out, so we didn‚Äôt have to wake anyone.

Despite the sleepless night, I felt okay the next morning. Did a short bike-run brick and clocked some of my fastest splits on the familiar course. Afternoon swim felt great‚Äîcalm sea, no wetsuit. But oh, how that would change.
Race morning: nerves, toast with jam, coffee. The usual. Then I stepped outside‚Ä¶ and it was pouring. Not a drizzle‚Äîan absolute downpour. Locals said it was the first rain in three months. Of course it was. I racked my bike, greeted some familiar faces, and joked, ‚ÄúWhat a lovely day we picked, huh?‚Äù My host said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not made of sugar,‚Äù so off we went.

The sea looked calm at first light. The swim course was familiar‚Äîjust more triangles this time. We lined up, got briefed, and with some delay, the race began.
I felt good for the first five minutes. Then the sea turned. By the first buoy, I was gasping, flailing like an epileptic poodle. Eventually found my rhythm, but lost all sense of direction. I tagged onto a small group and hoped they knew where they were going. Thankfully, they did. My watch showed nearly 2K‚Ä¶ on the first loop. Surely I hadn‚Äôt veered that far off course?
Then came the shoulder pain‚Äîsharp, stabbing, relentless. My wetsuit collar came undone, chafing my neck and armpits. I gritted my teeth and pushed through.

As I exited the first lap, I saw the race director, Iordanis, waist-deep in water like a Greek Moses. ‚ÄúOnly one more lap! The sea has pulled everything apart!‚Äù he shouted. Relief. But as we neared the next buoy, we got redirected again. The sea had other plans.

I stumbled out of the water after 1hr46, dizzy and dehydrated. Swallowed way too much saltwater. But I thought the worst was behind me.
Wrong.

On the short walk to T1, I felt a sudden, urgent pressure. I gestured to my mom‚Äîbathroom detour needed. And then‚Ä¶ my gut exploded. No warning. No mercy. I rushed to the restroom, cleaned up as best I could, but I felt off. Ill. Cold. Cramping. Still pouring rain. I got on the bike anyway.

Nutrition was a nightmare. Bars wouldn‚Äôt sit. Drinking was hard. Gels? Absolutely revolting. Shoulder pain worsened. Aero position became a battle. I didn‚Äôt want to admit it, but my race was already over.
I completed one 45km loop, power fading with every pedal stroke. Stopped for another emergency roadside break. Sat there, contemplating. I had nothing left. Pulled up to a crossing manned by the kindest policeman I‚Äôve ever met. He got me to the first aid station. The doctor checked me out. That was it.
I knew it was over the moment the policeman asked, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù And I wasn‚Äôt.

So yeah‚Ä¶ I did a Remco. Pulled out. Not with a bang, but with a whimper, a busted shoulder, and a gut that betrayed me harder than the weather forecast.
It sucks. It really does. I trained hard. I visualized the finish line. I wanted this race to be a redemption arc, a highlight reel. Instead, it turned into a blooper reel with a side of gastrointestinal drama.
But here‚Äôs the thing: I showed up. I tried. I learned. And next time, I‚Äôll be smarter, stronger, and hopefully less explosive in the digestive department.
To anyone out there prepping for their own big day‚Äîrespect the taper, check your gear, dodge the badgers, and for the love of all things holy, don‚Äôt trust the sea to behave.

|**Ledger Footnotes (Elias):** **July 20‚Äì27, 1885.** Knocks multiply and mimic. Samuel Pike found dead; silver arranged like tribute. Josiah returns changed; bearing a token. Curtis widens tests, refuses to be party to any exhibition. Town frays. I assemble a measured descent. E. Thatcher|

A ledger will tell you what day a man drew pay and which tool he left behind. It will not tell you how a lamp flattens a face so that the eyes look like coin, or the way the smell of oil and iron hangs on a man after he comes up from below. Memory keeps those things. So I write from it.





# I ‚Äî The Lip That Learned to Speak

Watches were a new habit older men had not burned away. I stood the lip with Curtis and Harris one night when the wind was full of grit and the town‚Äôs lights were only a handful of slow stars. Curtis had the phonograph wrapped in a battered case like a man carrying a small, dangerous relic. He placed the diaphragm to the timber and wound the crank with a care that looked priestly rather than preposterous.

He tapped the timber‚Äîthree even knocks. The drift answered, neat, like a man who had been practicing somebody else‚Äôs rhythm.

He tapped again in a different rhythm. The drift matched at first and then altered by the smallest fraction. It was not a mistake; it was a choice. Harris let the crank drop as if the machine itself might bite him.

‚ÄúIt said ‚ÄòTommy,‚Äô‚Äù he croaked, finger at his throat. His father, long dead, had called him that once when he stole fruit in summer. The name sat under his ribs like a bell.

Miguel‚Äôs rosary tightened so hard the beads clicked. ‚ÄúIt calls like abuela,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSoft, like it has learned how to be loved.‚Äù

Curtis wound another spool. ‚ÄúRecord,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf it mimics, we must know how it samples.‚Äù He set the diaphragm and let the thin hiss fill the space between us. When he played it back the spool showed us what it wanted to teach: each of us heard something different ‚Äî a mother‚Äôs hum, a boy‚Äôs nickname, a lullaby half-remembered. The spool did not give a single truth; it gave variants.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an echo,‚Äù Curtis said flatly. ‚ÄúIt recomposes. Adaptive mimicry. If it calls a name you will go looking for the thing that bears that name. That is the trap.‚Äù

I felt the trap like cold iron. Names call the way hunger does. If the seam could call in intimate tones, men would answer.





# II ‚Äî The Bunkhouse: Claims and Quiet Rage

The argument between Samuel and Josiah had the slow, grinding quality of two men that had been rubbing at each other for weeks. Samuel‚Äôs temper is loud by nature; Josiah‚Äôs new reserve was a quiet thing that made the glare of Samuel more visible.

‚ÄúYou go down at odd hours,‚Äù Samuel said one night, the lamp making his sharp face sharper. ‚ÄúAnd you come up with pockets heavy as prayer. Who else goes with you? Who else gets your hush?‚Äù

Josiah set a small silver disk on the plank as if stating a fact. He avoided the lantern‚Äôs glare and the men‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúThere are prices a man pays for his household,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll not understand till you‚Äôre the one who needs them.‚Äù

Samuel‚Äôs laugh made no sound of humor. ‚ÄúHiding prices is theft.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is balance,‚Äù Josiah answered, voice flat as a ledger‚Äôs stroke. ‚ÄúThe seam keeps a different account.‚Äù

They left with many words that night. In a town a mouth can be a weapon as much as a hammer; sometimes words split seams no one expected. I cannot say who threw the first blow. I can tell you who was found later.





# III ‚Äî The Finding: A Ritual Placed in the Dust

We found Samuel because someone went down for a trivial thing and came back without it. The lamplight flung a pale oval across him and caught the silver like a cruel offering.

He lay on his back, skull crushed inward as if a slow, deliberate weight had been applied. Around him the silver had been laid in two precise rings, one at his head, one at his feet, like a book clasped closed by metal. Curtis measured the spacing of the bars with the steadiness of a man taking notes after a storm.

‚ÄúDeliberate arrangement,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is not random.‚Äù

Murphy, the man who curses loud and prays quietly, dropped to his knees. He touched a coin and pulled his hand away as if the metal might burn. I looked at Josiah. He stood pale but composed, like a man who had written out a balance and accepted the sum.

‚ÄúYou argued late,‚Äù I said to him.

‚ÄúIt keeps accounts,‚Äù Josiah answered simply. There was no tremor in him. I felt a colder thing than grief then: a man who had settled his own account was not apt to weep for others.

Curtis set to work ‚Äî photograph the evidence, record bearings, take witness statements. He moved like a man whose tools were his prayer: measurement. ‚ÄúDocument,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf there is a law, then law requires record.‚Äù

We buried Samuel in a plain box. The ledger took his name and cause of death like a clerk; memory kept the silver.





# IV ‚Äî Curtis‚Äôs Protocol: Measurement as a Kind of Prayer

Curtis made the orchard of his methods. He drew up a field protocol as if a new pest had come to town: three water samples at set points, magnetometer readings at fixed intervals, phonograph runs at measured distances, brass tags left along a line to see whether anything would disturb them.

‚ÄúProof will quiet profit,‚Äù he told me when he handed me jars and a map. ‚ÄúIf we can show a physical effect, then law has something to hold. If not, rumor is the only currency left.‚Äù

He left brass discs in the drift; one was nudged a single inch by morning. ‚ÄúMoved, not stolen,‚Äù he said. The cartridge assays came back with odd readings: iron and trace organometallics out of proportion to the seam‚Äôs expected output.

When town merchants asked him for a certificate that they could hang beneath velvet ropes, he put the jars between them and said, ‚ÄúI will not be the official of a carnival. I will provide a declaration to the county. I will not sell tickets.‚Äù

He became my ally because his resolve was not for show. He would not be bent to the town‚Äôs appetite for coin.





# V ‚Äî The Town‚Äôs Small Abnormalities

A hundred small things began to sew a new story. Clocks stopped and restarted ten minutes fast. Mr. Calder‚Äôs loaves sprouted lacey mold in the shape of doors. A blacksmith‚Äôs bellows sang at an odd pitch for an hour and then was ordinary again. Children woke tasting copper and drew doors in chalk they would not scrub away.

Se√±or Vasquez spoke in old Spanish of *puertas* ‚Äî thin places ‚Äî and the Cornish men muttered of a ‚Äúknocker‚Äù under the hill. Folklore and measurement sat at the same table and both took a slice of the town‚Äôs attention. When superstition and science both point at the same seam you know the argument is not easily resolved.

Curtis wrote it all down‚Äîpatient as a town clerk and twice as stubborn. People began to look at their children the way one looks at a ledger after a bad night of counting: with fear in the margins.





# VI ‚Äî The Descent: Rope, Light, and the Answering Hand

The men who volunteered to go with me were the ones I trusted. Harris, steady in the work of the hoist; Murphy, who had kept a thousand knots taut in his hands; Miguel, trembling but brave for his abuela; and Curtis, with his coils and spool. We took rope, lamp oil, a small controlled charge to be used only as last measure, and the phonograph itself.

We descended into that dark where light becomes a poor thing and sound thickens. The knock followed like a hound who learned the call and practiced it in the dark. At one place it called Harris by a boy‚Äôs name he had not been called since his father lived. He faltered and swallowed and went on because there was a foreman with a rope and a man who kept records.

Curtis wired a diaphragm to the coil and propped it against the timber. He let the spool run and we moved beyond the place where men always work and into the place where old timbers groan and the air tastes faintly of metal and old cold. In one narrow mouth the gap widened, and a pale wrist ‚Äî long-fingered, slow ‚Äî glided through, feeling, patient. Miguel, who had come for his abuela, let the small pouch fall without a sound. The hand closed and withdrew. The knock afterwards was like the tick of a book closed.

We came up with jars clouded when kept near the seam, spool recordings that changed each time you listened, and compasses that jittered the closer you came. Curtis wrapped the evidence in cloth and wrote like a man building a case: timestamps, coordinates, witness signatures. ‚ÄúIf men will not be stopped by conscience,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthey may be stopped by law.‚Äù





# VII ‚Äî Josiah‚Äôs Quiet Bargain

Afterwards Josiah sat with me beneath the assay office eaves and put a small silver disk in my palm the way a man hands over a certificate. ‚ÄúIt asked for names,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt accepted my offering and promised a kind of peace.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of peace?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúA roof for the children,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMedicine for the old. A way not to have to leave.‚Äù He said it like a man reading terms into a contract and feeling no shame. There was a peace in his face I did not trust; it was the calm of a man who had received a receipt for a debt I could not understand.

He would not‚Äîcould not‚Äîspeak plainly of who gave what or how the counting had been done. He only said, ‚ÄúIt keeps accounts.‚Äù And in that sentence he taught me something terrible: the Door measures in things we keep close and cannot afford to surrender.





# VIII ‚Äî Curtis‚Äôs Logs (Extracts)

||

|**Curtis: Field Log 7/22 ‚Äî Phonograph Spool 3** 00:10 ‚Äî Tap pattern initiated (3 / pause / 2). Response matched then modulated. 00:35 ‚Äî Playback 1: Response contained phonetic overlap approximating ‚ÄúMa‚Äî‚Äù (observer: Miguel). Subsequent playbacks altered. Hypothesis: localized acoustic field sampling memory fragments and reconstituting them adaptively. J. Curtis|
|**Curtis: Water Assay 7/23 ‚Äî Sample Set A** Sample 1 (well above seam): baseline. Sample 2 (adjacent seam): Fe ion elevated 2.6√ó baseline; trace organometallics present. Sample 3 (downstream 50m): copper bloom present after 24 hours. J. Curtis|

Curtis underlined figures until ink left an impression. He believed the county would have a slower hand than a man‚Äôs grief; he believed also in the stubbornness of proof.





# IX ‚Äî Miguel‚Äôs Offering; The Hand That Closed

Miguel came to the lip with his small leather pouch and knelt like a man offering a votive. The hand slipped through the seam and took it. He crossed himself and kept his head down for a week. After that small offering we found more: rosaries, coins, small trinkets left at the door as one leaves seeds for harvest. Men began to imagine the seam as a scale they could feed.

But you cannot feed a ledger with names without the ledger waking to collect; some prices are paid in things not stamped by any mint. Samuel was one form of payment; Miguel‚Äôs pouch another. Men started to sleep badly.





# X ‚Äî Mrs. Joy Gleaner: Asides, Design, and the Parlor of Promise

Mrs. Gleaner has always been the town‚Äôs forward voice and its gentlest mercenary. When she speaks to a room she often speaks to more than the room. She breaks the wall that divides speaker and spectator and addresses a you that is sometimes the reader and sometimes the city she will make in her head.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner ‚Äî aside.)* ‚ÄúNow, listen,‚Äù she says to the unseen guest as much as to the men gathered before her. ‚ÄúYou and I both know what sells: a singularity wrapped in comfort. Give a person a clean bed and a cup of tea and you may ask him, afterward, to pay for wonder. Hotels are not brick and mortar alone‚Äîthey are promises with linens and coffee. If you want Calico to be known, you put a parlor where people can feel safe and then you show them the thing on purpose.‚Äù|

She turned to Curtis with the practicality of a woman who trades in real estate and reputations. ‚ÄúIf I build a hotel on the ridge,‚Äù she said, ‚Äútell me the minimum to make it safe. Tell me where to set piles. Tell me what will keep my guests from sleeping with the taste of fear on their tongues.‚Äù

Curtis sketched. ‚ÄúDrive piles beyond the affected strata. Build raised foundations with ventilated crawlspaces. Keep any water supply well away from suspect run-off. Independent assays and public reporting before construction.‚Äù

||
||
|*(Mrs. Gleaner ‚Äî aside.)* ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs tedious‚Äîhe will be tedious to your tastes‚Äîbut he keeps a town from being sued. We will fund the assays and print the results on brochures: ‚ÄòRestored with care‚Äîsupervised by a qualified scientist.‚Äô You will sleep in a room with a view, sip tea, and tell your friends about our bravery. Or you will curse me later in a local paper. Both make for good history.‚Äù|

She wrote Curtis a retainer with a flourish and a smile. He accepted only on the condition that his reports be made public if danger was evident. She shook his hand, turned to me, and said with a candor that felt like a business plan dressed in velvet: ‚ÄúWe will make the town last. We will be careful.‚Äù

Whether ‚Äúwe‚Äù meant protection or profit was a question that split men‚Äôs faces into light and shadow.





# XI ‚Äî Closing the Throat: Plan and Precaution

Curtis spread his maps across the assay table and drew lines like a surgeon‚Äôs incision. ‚ÄúWe can sever the throat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA controlled collapse at the narrow passage behind the door should choke the route. Use charges placed precisely; watch the bearings; document witnesses.‚Äù He did not flirt with dynamite‚Äôs romance. He spoke of it as a tool to be measured.

We assembled a small party of men who would not profit by spectacle: Harris, Murphy, Miguel, two steadier hands. We packed rope, wedges, charges only sufficient to bring in rock and pack the aperture. Curtis insisted on witnesses and a record of everything.

I slept poorly that week. Men offered their hands for holes in the roster one minute and signed contracts for guided tours the next. The town‚Äôs ledger tilted under the weight of immediate need. I thought if we must make an ugly choice, it would be better to make it clean and recorded.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Gleaner ‚Äî aside, last.)* ‚ÄúYou will make novels of me, I know, and that is fine,‚Äù she said, addressing you again as if we shared a private joke. ‚ÄúSavior or monster, you will call me what comforts you. I prefer titles. They frame a life. We will build a parlor and a pump and call it progress. You may hate me later; I will have bought the town a season. Isn‚Äôt that itself an act of mercy?‚Äù|

She smiled, and men smiled with her, some with gratitude, some with the terrible blankness of those who think the ledger will cure what prayers will not.





I close the ledger for the night with Curtis‚Äôs spool wrapped and the coil of wire coiled neatly. The men who will go with me are steadier than the money-men; they do not scheme the way investors do. I have charges measured and a small band of witnesses who will attest to what we do, and why. If the town will not be saved by a law that moves slow, then I will try to save it by a law written in something steadier than coin: witness, record, and a foreman‚Äôs hands.",2,1759684432.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

This weekend there was an emergency and my uncle may pass away at anytime.  Someone has to be home to care for my disabled cousin at my aunt‚Äôs  (uncle‚Äôs son from a different marriage) at all times. A difference aunt stayed at the house while I took my aunt to the hospital.  My aunt has mobility issues and this is my first time being someone‚Äôs main support. All of my family on this side, are early 60s to 70 including my Dad. My Aunt‚Äôs adopted son (m35) couldn‚Äôt be present. I thought I was about to be alone with my aunt at night in the hospital and receive the news that my uncle has passed. My boyfriend asked if I wanted him to drive over (40-50 minute drive) and I caved and said yes. 

(During all of this I‚Äôm trying to follow my Aunt‚Äôs wishes with who she is ok with stopping by the hospital and supporting us vs who won‚Äôt badger her with questions. Along with who can come/ who‚Äôs too overwhelmed with their own situations and my Dad trying to find/rescue a kitten that is stuck in his attic.)

My Dad and Boyfriend end up showing up at the same time at the lobby as I‚Äôm taking my Aunt to see her husband for the first and possibly last time.  Later we leave the hospital so I can take my aunt home and I‚Äôm debating returning to the hospital to stay over night just in case and I asked my boyfriend to stay with me. He was reluctant and I gave him an out.  But we ended up sleeping over at my aunts as I got up throughout the night calling the hospital to regularly check up on my uncle. My boyfriend left this morning to go back home after getting us coffee.

I was texting my Dad just now, and he made the comment that I ‚Äúseem a bit demanding‚Äù  of my boyfriend. I‚Äôm hurt by the comment and a bit baffled and now concerned that maybe he‚Äôs right?

Am I being too demanding of my boyfriend? Was this an unreasonable request for him to spend the night in case of the worst case scenario?",3,1759684296.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1nytvgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nytvgf/i_cant_hear_the_crumbly_cookie_jingle/,I Can't Hear the Crumbly Cookie Jingle,"I'm writing this because I need someone to tell me they remember the world the way I do. I need proof that I'm not losing my mind, or if I am, I need a record of what I was before this happened.

Three weeks ago, I lost my job to budget cuts at a marketing firm already circling the drain. I kept telling myself I was safe, that my work mattered. It didn't.

Two weeks ago, Jennifer left. She said it wasn't my fault, that she needed different things. I know the truth. I spent every evening on the couch scrolling through my phone, talking about how things used to be better. She wanted someone with a future. I stayed stuck.

My back hurts constantly now. Thirty-six years old and I wake up every morning feeling like I'm sixty. Probably from all those years hunched over a desk, but I can't afford a chiropractor anymore. I can't afford much of anything anymore.

This isn't how I imagined adulthood. I'm in a one-bedroom apartment I can barely afford, eating cereal for dinner, wondering when I stopped trying.

The nostalgia started as a comfort thing. When you can't sleep and your brain won't stop cataloging all the ways you've failed, it helps to watch old Nickelodeon commercials or read about discontinued snack foods. There's something soothing about remembering a time when your biggest concern was whether you'd get to watch your favorite show after school. Everything was simpler. Everything was possible.

I know it's unhealthy. I know I'm using it as an escape. But it's the only thing that quiets my mind anymore.

YouTube's algorithm has learned exactly what I want. Obscure toy commercials from 1994. Forgotten Saturday morning cartoon blocks. Local station IDs from regional networks that don't exist anymore. The more specific, the better. There's a whole community of us, people who archive this stuff, people who remember. The comments sections are full of people saying ""I thought I was the only one who remembered this"" or ""I've been looking for this for twenty years."" It feels like home in a way my actual apartment doesn't.

Three nights ago, I couldn't sleep. My back was killing me, and my brain was doing that thing where it replays every conversation you've ever had and points out all the ways you sounded stupid. I opened YouTube around 11 PM, thinking I'd watch a few videos and drift off.

Six hours later, I was still awake.

I started with the usual 90s commercials and cartoon bumpers. Each video led to another, more specific, more obscure.

Around 3 AM, I found a channel dedicated entirely to regional grocery store commercials from the mid-90s. The production values were terrible, the acting was painful, but I watched every single one. There was something hypnotic about it. These tiny capsules of a world that didn't exist anymore, preserved by someone who cared enough to digitize them.

At 4 AM, I was watching compilation videos of forgotten cereal mascots. Characters that lasted maybe one year before being quietly retired. I remembered some of them. Most of them I didn't. But the aesthetic was right. That specific color palette, that animation style, that overwhelming sense of manufactured joy.

By 5 AM, I'd moved on to obscure public access children's shows. Local productions from cities I'd never lived in, hosted by people who'd probably never worked in television again. The video quality was degrading. More VHS artifacts, more tracking errors, more of that analog warmth that felt like being wrapped in a blanket.

I knew I should stop. I had an interview at noon that I was unprepared for. My eyes were burning, my back screaming.

I couldn't.

The real world was waiting for me when I closed the laptop. The stack of bills on my desk. The job search spreadsheet with its growing list of rejections. The empty side of the bed. All of it sitting there in the dark, patient and inevitable.

In the videos, none of that existed. There were no bills in 1995. No failed relationships. No aching joints or stagnant careers. Just Saturday mornings and sugary cereal and the promise that everything would turn out fine.

At 5:47 AM, I clicked on a video titled ""90s Snack Commercials You Totally Forgot About."" Forty-three minutes long. Uploaded by a channel with 300 subscribers. The description was minimal: ""VHS rip from a 1996 recording. Some tracking issues but mostly clean.""

I hit play.

The first few commercials were exactly what I expected. Dunkaroos with their cartoon kangaroo. Gushers with kids' heads transforming into fruit. Those pizza-flavored Combos that tasted like cardboard soaked in cheese powder. I remembered all of them. I could hear the jingles before they played.

Then, at the 31-minute mark, something appeared that I didn't recognize.

The commercial opened on an aggressively cheerful kitchen. The animation style was cheap, even by 90s standards. A cartoon family with those weird oval heads and stick limbs that low-budget studios used because they were easy to animate. The color palette was oversaturated, everything too bright and flat. The mom had an apron and an impossible smile. The dad was reading a newspaper at a kitchen table that looked more like a cardboard cutout than furniture.

The mom sat a tray of cookies on the table. They were enormous, covered in exaggerated chocolate chips that sparkled and literally winked at the camera. The animation was stiff, cycled. You could see the same three frames repeating as steam rose from the tray.

A voice-over began, enthusiastic and gender-neutral in that specific 90s commercial way: ""When you want a treat that's sweet and neat, reach for Crumbly Cookies!""

The cartoon kid at the table grabbed one of the cookies. His eyes grew to twice their normal size. He bit into it, and the chocolate chips exploded into stars. Standard commercial hyperbole.

Then the music swelled. The animation zoomed in on the cookie. The mom, dad, and kid all opened their mouths in unison, clearly about to deliver the jingle, the memorable hook, the part that would burrow into your brain and live there for decades.

And I heard nothing.

It wasn't silence. The audio didn't cut out completely. There was sound, but it was compressed, distorted. Like someone had taken that section of the audio file and replaced it with white noise, with static, with the sound of a corrupted file trying to play. Maybe a few seconds of garbled nothing where the jingle should have been.

Then the commercial resumed. The voice-over returned: ""Crumbly Cookies! Available at grocery stores everywhere!"" The family was back to smiling, the cookie was back to sparkling, and then it cut to the next commercial in the compilation.

I sat there staring at the screen. My first thought was that the VHS rip was damaged. These old recordings always had issues. Tracking problems, audio dropouts, sections where the tape had degraded.

I scrolled down to the comments to see if anyone else had noticed the corrupted audio.

The top comment, posted three months ago, had 847 likes: ""CRUMB-LY, CRUMB-LY, COO-KIE! This jingle lives in my head rent-free 24/7. I'm 34 and I still can't get it out.""

I read it twice. Then I read the second comment.

""My mom used to sing this to annoy us on road trips. Thanks for unlocking that memory lol.""

The third comment: ""This jingle is literally the reason I became a jingle writer. No joke. It's perfectly constructed. That key change in the middle? Chef's kiss.""

Fourth comment: ""Anyone else hear this in their nightmares? It's been 30 years and I can still hear every note.""

I scrolled through dozens more. People quoting the jingle. People sharing detailed memories of where they were when they first heard it. Someone had written a full paragraph analyzing the musical composition, discussing chord progressions and melodic intervals and the genius of the rhyme scheme.

Not one person mentioned corrupted audio. Not one person said the jingle was missing or damaged.

They were all hearing something I wasn't.

I clicked back to the video and replayed the commercial. Same result. The setup was fine, the voice-over was clear, and then that static gap where the jingle should have been, followed by the outro.

I searched Crumbly Cookie jingle again.

Six different YouTube videos came up, all of them just the jingle itself, cleanly extracted from the commercial. ""Crumbly Cookie Jingle (1996) - Clean Audio,"" ""Crumbly Cookie Song - Full Version,"" ""Crumbly Cookie Jingle - 10 Hour Loop.""

I clicked the first one. The video was just a still image of the cookie from the commercial with a sparkle effect looping endlessly. The audio began. I heard the music start, that swelling buildup, and then the same compressed static gap, then silence.

The video was fifteen seconds long. According to the timeline, the jingle should have lasted for twelve of those seconds.

The comments section had over two thousand comments. All of them talking about how catchy the jingle was. How memorable. How it had defined their childhood.

I found it on Spotify, on a playlist of 90s jingles. Track seven. Every playback was the same. Buildup, static, outro.

It was 6:30 AM. The sun was starting to come up outside my window. I could hear my neighbor's alarm going off through the thin walls.

I told myself it was some kind of internet joke. A collective bit where everyone pretended to remember something that didn't exist, just to mess with people. The Mandela Effect weaponized.

I closed my laptop and tried to sleep.

At noon, I bombed the phone interview. I couldn't focus. I kept thinking about the static gap, about all those comments, about the certainty in people's comments when they talked about a jingle I couldn't hear.

At 2 PM, I texted Derek and asked if he wanted to grab coffee.

Derek and I have been friends since high school. We have this routine where we send each other the dumbest, most obscure nostalgic garbage we can find online. Weird local commercials, forgotten toy lines, and discontinued snack foods. He's the only person I know who understands the appeal.

We met at the coffee shop on Fifth Street at 3 PM. He was already there, scrolling through his phone. He looked up when I walked in and immediately frowned.

""You look like hell,"" he said.

""Couldn't sleep."" I sat down across from him. ""Hey, do you remember Crumbly Cookies? Like, the snack brand from the 90s?""

His face lit up immediately. ""Oh man, yeah! My grandma used to keep them in her pantry. They were pretty mediocre, honestly, but that jingle..."" He started nodding his head to some internal rhythm, smiling. ""Dude, you just put that back in my head. I'm going to be humming it all day now.""

My stomach dropped.

""Can you hum it for me?"" I asked.

He looked at me like I'd asked him to explain basic arithmetic. ""You're kidding, right? You don't remember the Crumbly Cookie song?""

""I remember the commercial,"" I said. ""I just can't remember the jingle part.""

""How do you remember the commercial but not the jingle? The jingle is the whole point.""

""I'm serious. I watched the commercial this morning. The audio cuts out right where the jingle should be.""

Derek stared at me for a long moment. Then he laughed, but it was an uncomfortable laugh. ""That's a weird bit, man. Is this like a setup for something?""

""It's not a bit.""

""Then you need to get some sleep. The Crumbly Cookie jingle is like... it's foundational. Everyone knows it."" He picked up his coffee and took a sip, still watching me with that confused expression. ""Are you feeling okay? Like, actually?""

I tried to laugh it off. ""Yeah, just tired. Forget I asked.""

He kept staring at me, and I could tell he thought I was messing with him, or worse, that something was deeply wrong with me.

We talked about other things for another twenty minutes, but the conversation felt strained. When we left, Derek gave me this look, concerned and bewildered, and told me to get some rest.

I walked home slowly. My back was killing me.

When I passed the corner of Fifth and Maple, I stopped.

There was a bakery there. A small storefront with a cheerful sign and a painted window.

I'd walked past that corner three times a week for the past two years.

It used to be a dry cleaner.

The sign read ""Cookie Crumble Cafe"" in that same aggressively cheerful font from the commercial. The mascot painted on the window was a cartoon cookie with a smiling face and oversized chocolate chips that sparkled. The color palette was identical: that specific shade of yellow-orange background with bright red accents that cheap 90s animation loved.

I stood on the sidewalk for maybe ten minutes, just staring. The building looked old. Genuinely weathered. The paint on the window was faded in places, chipped at the edges. The awning had sun damage. There was a historical business registry plaque near the door, the kind the city puts up for establishments that have been around for decades.

I walked closer and read it.

""Cookie Crumble Cafe. Est. 1997.""

Twenty-eight years. According to this plaque, this bakery had been here for twenty-eight years.

I knew what I'd see if I went inside. I knew I should just keep walking, go home, take some ibuprofen for my back, and try to sleep. But I couldn't make myself leave.

The bell above the door chimed when I pushed it open. The interior matched the exterior perfectly. Bright, cheerful, slightly dated. The display case was full of oversized cookies with exaggerated chocolate chips. The walls were painted that same yellow-orange. There were framed photos hung up behind the counter: the bakery at various points in its history, or at least what appeared to be its history.

A woman in her fifties stood behind the register. She smiled when she saw me.

""First time here?"" she asked.

""When did this place open?"" The question came out more aggressively than I intended.

She didn't seem bothered. ""Oh, we've been here forever. Twenty-eight years this November. My mom opened it right after those Crumbly Cookie commercials got big, shame the company went out of business. She loved that jingle so much she decided to build a whole store around it. I thought she was crazy, but it worked out."" She gestured at the display case. ""We've got twelve varieties now. The chocolate chip is still the most popular, obviously.""

""What was here before?"" I asked.

She looked confused. ""Before? Nothing. This was an empty lot. My mom bought the property and built from the ground up.""

""There wasn't a dry cleaner here?""

""Not that I know of. Maybe you're thinking of a different corner?""

I left without buying anything.

When I got back to my apartment, I went straight to my laptop. I needed to prove to myself that I wasn't losing my mind. I needed documentation, evidence, something concrete.

I pulled up Google Maps and searched for the corner of Fifth and Maple. The street view loaded. I clicked back through the historical imagery, the archived photos that Google keeps from previous years.

Every archived image from 2012 to 2023 showed the same building: Cookie Crumble Cafe.

I sat back from my laptop and pressed my palms against my eyes. Maybe I'd been wrong about the dry cleaner. Maybe I was misremembering. Maybe it had been on a different corner, or a different street entirely.

I knew I wasn't wrong.

I opened YouTube again and searched for the Crumbly Cookie commercial. I clicked on a video essay someone had made about 90s advertising trends. It was forty minutes long, and at the fifteen-minute mark, the creator started discussing the cultural impact of the Crumbly Cookie jingle.

""This is one of those rare cases where a commercial jingle transcended advertising and became a genuine cultural touchstone,"" the narrator said. 

""Everyone who grew up in the 90s can sing this. It's been referenced in TV shows, parodied in comedy sketches, and studied in marketing courses as an example of perfect jingle construction.""

The video played a clip of the commercial. The family, the cookie, the buildup.

Static gap.

I checked the comments. Four hundred people talking about how accurate the video essay was, how the jingle really had been everywhere, how it was impossible to forget.

I clicked on another video. A local news segment from 2015 about nostalgic food trends. The reporter interviewed people on the street, asking them about snacks from their childhood. Three different people mentioned Crumbly Cookies. One of them sang the jingle on camera.

I watched her mouth move. I watched her face light up with nostalgia. I heard her voice forming the melody.

But all I heard was that rhythmic cadence, that four-beat pause-three-beat pattern, wrapped in static.

I spent the next hour going through everything. Reddit threads about 90s nostalgia. BuzzFeed listicles about discontinued snacks. Academic articles about advertising and memory. The Crumbly Cookie jingle appeared everywhere, referenced constantly, treated as a universally known cultural artifact.

And I couldn't hear it.

At some point during my search, I saw the name ""The Knight Trippers"" appear in a comment thread. Someone had written: ""Fun fact: the duo who sang the Crumbly Cookie jingle went on to have a pretty successful music career. The Knight Trippers. They've got some great albums if you're into folk music.""

I knew that name.

The Knight Trippers were an indie folk group. Late 90s, early 2000s. I owned two of their albums. They had this haunting, understated sound, and sang in a duet style like Alice in Chains, but with a folk twist. They wrote quiet songs about loneliness and small-town depression. I'd discovered their music in college, during a particularly bad semester, and those songs had helped me feel less alone.

I pulled up the Wikipedia page.

The first line read: ""The Knight Trippers are an American singer-songwriter duo best known for performing the Crumbly Cookie jingle in 1996, which became one of the most recognizable advertising songs of the decade.""

I read it three times.

The article described their career in detail. The jingle had been their big break. It led to a contract with a major label, two pop albums in the late 90s and early 2000s, and eventually a transition back to folk music in the 2010s when the pop career faded. There were sections about their touring history, their influences, their legacy.

The two albums I remembered, ""Basement Hymns"" and ""Evening Drove,"" weren't mentioned anywhere.

I got up from my desk and went to my bookshelf. I still buy physical media. CDs, vinyl, even cassettes if I can find them. There's something comforting about having a tangible object, something that can't be changed by an algorithm or deleted from a streaming service.

I found ""Basement Hymns"" exactly where I'd left it, wedged between two other folk albums. I pulled it out and looked at the cover. Their faces in black and white, staring past the camera with that sad, distant expression I remembered.

I turned it over to check the track listing.

The back cover had been redesigned. The font was different, more commercial. The track titles had changed. Where ""Sirens on the Highway"" used to be, there was now a song called ""After the Fame."" Where ""Basement Light"" had been, there was ""Cookie Crumbs and Heartbreak.""

The liner notes, printed in tiny text along the bottom, included a paragraph: ""Special thanks to the Crumbly Cookie campaign for giving us our start. This album wouldn't exist without that magical moment in a recording studio in 1996.""

My hands were shaking. I put the CD in my laptop's external drive and opened the audio files.

The first track started playing. It was their voice. Definitely their voice. That same haunting quality, that slight rasp on the edges of certain words.

But the song was different.

The melody echoed Sirens on the Highway, but the lyrics were wrong. They sang about childhood, chocolate chips, and memories of commercials.

I skipped to the next track. Same thing. The bones of ""Basement Light"" were there, but the lyrics now referenced nostalgia, sweetness, the comfort of simple pleasures.

Every song had been rewritten. Every song now contained some oblique reference to cookies, to childhood, to that jingle.

I ejected the CD and held it in my hands, staring at it. The disc itself looked normal. No visible damage, no signs of tampering. Just a regular CD that had somehow rewritten itself.

A brief, fragmented memory danced across my mind. Not a full recollection, but the ghost of a memory. Something about my tenth birthday. 

I picked up my phone and called my mom.

She answered on the third ring. ""Hey, sweetheart. What's going on?""

""Do you remember my tenth birthday?"" I asked.

""Of course I do. You wanted that Pokemon cake from the grocery store, but they were sold out, so I made you one from scratch. It was a disaster. Frosting everywhere."" She laughed. ""Why do you ask?""

""Did you make anything else? Any other food?""

There was a pause. I could hear her thinking. ""Well, I made those Crumbly Cookies as a joke. You were obsessed with that commercial. You used to sing the jingle constantly, drove me absolutely crazy. I found a copycat recipe online and made them from scratch. Put them on a little platter around the cake. They turned out pretty good, actually.""

My throat felt tight. ""I don't remember that.""

""Really? You made me sing the jingle while you blew out the candles. God, I can still hear it in your little kid voice."" She started singing, her voice lilting up and down in a melodic pattern.

I heard the rhythm. I heard the cadence of her voice, the way it rose and fell. I heard the affection and nostalgia in her tone.

But I didn't hear the melody. Just that static gap, that compressed nothing where the tune should have been.

""Alex? Are you still there?""

""Yeah,"" I said. ""Just feeling nostalgic.""

""Are you okay? You sound strange.""

""I'm fine. Just tired. I should go.""

""Wait, before you hang up. Your cousin Emily posted that photo from your tenth birthday on Facebook last week. Did you see it? You looked so happy. I'm going to print it out and frame it.""

""I didn't see it. I'll check.""

""Okay, honey. Get some rest. Love you.""

""Love you too.""

I hung up and opened Facebook. I rarely use it anymore, but I logged in and searched for my cousin's profile. There, posted six days ago, was a photo album titled ""Throwback: Alex's 10th Birthday.""

I clicked on it.

The first photo showed me at ten years old, standing in front of a chocolate cake with candles. I was smiling. My mom was in the background, laughing. The image quality was that specific early digital camera look, slightly grainy and oversaturated.

Around the cake, on a decorative platter, were oversized cookies with exaggerated chocolate chips.

The second photo was a close-up of me holding one of the cookies, taking a bite, my eyes squeezed shut in exaggerated joy.

The third photo showed my mom and me together, both of us with our mouths open, clearly singing something.

The caption read: ""Remember when Aunt Sarah made those amazing Crumbly Cookies? Alex made us all sing the jingle! Good times.""

Seventeen likes. Eight comments from family members and old family friends, all reminiscing about the party, about how much I'd loved that jingle, about how funny it was that I'd insisted everyone sing it.

I didn't remember any of this. Not the cookies, not the singing, not that look of pure joy on my ten-year-old face.

The photo existed. The comments existed. My mother's memory existed.

And I was the only one who didn't remember.

I closed my laptop and looked around my apartment. Everything looked slightly off. Colors flattened, shadows sharpened, furniture looked painted on.

I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.

My face was the same. Same tired eyes, same stubble, same scar on my chin from a skateboarding accident when I was sixteen. But there was something wrong with the reflection. The colors were too bright. My skin looked smooth in a way that real skin doesn't look, like I was seeing myself through a filter.

I reached up and touched my face. My hand felt normal. But watching the reflection move, there was this fractional delay, this tiny gap between my movement and what I saw in the mirror.

I stood there for maybe five minutes, just staring, trying to figure out what had changed.

Then I realized: I had a rhythm stuck in my head.

Over and over. Like a song I couldn't quite remember, a melody that existed as shape without sound.

I knew there were words there. I knew there was a tune. But when I tried to access it, there was only that static gap, that white noise void where the jingle should have been.

CRUMB-LY, CRUMB-LY, COO-KIE.

I knew that's what it said. Everyone had told me. I'd read it a hundred times.

But I couldn't hear it.

And that inability, that gap in my perception, felt like the only thing still anchoring me to who I'd been before.

That was yesterday evening.

I haven't left my apartment since then.

I've spent the past eighteen hours sitting at this laptop, documenting everything. Taking screenshots, writing notes, trying to create some kind of record before it's too late. The laptop is the only thing that still feels completely real. The keys under my fingers, the screen's glow, the cursor blinking at the end of each sentence.

Everything else is changing now.

My furniture looks like stage props. The walls are too smooth, the lighting too even. When I look at my books on the shelf, the spines seem flat, two-dimensional, like someone painted them on rather than them being actual objects.

I tried to leave twice today. Both times I opened the door and looked at the hallway outside, and I couldn't make myself step through. The carpet was rendered in that textureless way. The walls had that oversaturated color. The light fixtures looked drawn on.

It looked like the background art from the Crumbly Cookie commercial.

The screenshots I took yesterday have changed. I opened them this morning to review my evidence, and they were different. The Knight Trippers Wikipedia page had more detail now, more sections about the jingle's cultural impact. I checked the metadata on the image files. According to the timestamps, I took these screenshots yesterday at 6:47 PM.

But the content was different than what I remembered capturing.

I took another screenshot of the same Wikipedia page. I opened both images side by side. Within twenty minutes, the new screenshot had changed too. More details added. Different phrasing in the introduction. The edit history showing changes made years ago.

The photo I took of the bakery has been transforming too. Each time I open it, the building looks older. There's graffiti on the side wall now that wasn't there when I took the picture.

I'm looking at my hands right now as I type this. They look the same, but they don't feel the same. The texture is slightly off. When I move my fingers, there's this fractional delay, like I'm watching myself on a video stream with bad latency.

I looked in the mirror again an hour ago. I'm still me. Same face, same tired eyes, same scar on my chin. But the colors are different. My skin looks flatter, rendered in that cheap animation style. The shadows on my face are too sharp, too defined, like someone traced them with a marker.

I can feel it happening to me.

There's a pressure in my skull. It's been building since last night. It feels like something pushing against the inside of my forehead, trying to get in. When I think about my childhood, I see two versions of every memory. The real version, the one I know happened. And another version, flickering underneath it, where Crumbly Cookies existed, where I sang the jingle, where my life always included this thing I can't perceive.

The false memories are getting stronger. Sometimes I'll be sitting here and I'll suddenly remember a birthday party with cookies I know never existed. Or I'll hear my mother's voice in my head, singing that jingle, and for a moment it almost makes sense. For a moment, the melody is almost there.

Then it dissolves back into static.

I called Derek twenty minutes ago. I needed to hear a familiar voice. I needed someone to confirm I was still real.

""Hey man,"" he said. ""What's up?""

""I need you to tell me the truth,"" I said. ""About the Crumbly Cookie jingle. Do you actually remember it, or is everyone just pretending?""

""Alex, are you okay? You sound really weird.""

""Just answer the question. Please.""

He sighed. ""Yes, I remember it. We used to sing it together on the bus in middle school. You started it, actually. You thought it was hilarious. We'd sing it until the bus driver told us to shut up. Like, we did this at least once a week for an entire year.""

""I don't remember that.""

""Well, I do. Dude, seriously, what's going on with you? This isn't funny anymore.""

""Can you sing it for me? Right now?""

""I'm at work.""

""Please. I need to hear it.""

There was a long pause. Then he started singing. His voice was self-conscious at first, then got more confident. I could hear him smiling as he sang, remembering. I heard the words forming, the pitch rising and falling. I heard the enthusiasm, the nostalgia, the affection for a shared memory.

But I didn't hear the melody.

Just that rhythm. Four beats, pause, three beats. The cadence of the words wrapped in static.

""Did you hear it?"" he asked.

""Yeah,"" I lied. ""Thanks.""

""Are you sure you're okay? Do you need me to come over?""

""No. I'm fine. I just needed to hear it.""

""Okay. But seriously, if you need anything, call me. You're freaking me out a little.""

I hung up before he could say anything else.

I sat there holding my phone, staring at it. The screen looked flat. The icons looked painted on. When I pressed the home button, there was that same fractional delay.

Everything is becoming background art.

I'm not fading or disappearing. I'm being pulled into a world my mind can't process.

A world where the Crumbly Cookie jingle has always existed, where I've always known it, where my entire life has been shaped by it.

But I can't hear it.

And that gap, that inability, is the only thing keeping me tethered to who I was.

I don't know how much longer I can hold on. The pressure in my skull is getting worse. My hands are starting to look different when I glance down at them. The apartment is transforming around me, becoming more and more like a stage set, a background, a low-resolution environment for characters who can actually hear the jingle.

I'm typing this as fast as I can because I need to finish it. I need to post it before the transformation completes. Before my mind rewrites itself to match this new reality, this reality where I've always been able to hear the song.

If you're reading this, and you remember a world where Crumbly Cookies didn't exist, or where The Knight Trippers sang quiet folk songs instead of commercial jingles, or where that corner was a dry cleaner and not a bakery, please tell me. Please leave a comment. I need to know there's still a world out there that matches my memories.

And if you can hear the jingle, if you've always been able to hear it, I need you to understand something:

I can't.

I've never been able to.

And that's the only thing keeping me from forgetting who I was.

I can hear the rhythm in my head right now. It's constant. The words are there, shape without sound, meaning without music. My mouth wants to form them. My brain keeps trying to access the melody.

CRUMB-LY, CRUMB-LY, COO-KIE.

I know that's what it says. Everyone knows what it says.

But I can't hear it.

I'm going to post this now. I don't know if anyone will believe me. I don't know if anyone who reads this will remember the world I came from. Maybe I'm the only one. Maybe I slipped through some crack in reality during that six-hour binge, and everyone else is exactly where they've always been, in a world where the Crumbly Cookie jingle has existed for thirty years.

Or maybe some of you will read this and recognize what I'm describing. Maybe you'll feel that same gap, that same static where something should be. Maybe you'll realize you can't quite remember something everyone else seems to know.

If that's you, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

I'm still here. I'm still conscious. I can still think, still type, still function. But I'm alone in a way I can't fully explain. I'm living in a world that has rewritten itself around me, and I'm the only one who notices the edits.

The jingle is still playing in my head. The rhythm won't stop. And I know, eventually, my mind will find a way to fill in that static gap. It will generate the melody it's supposed to hear. It will rewrite my memories to match everyone else's. It will make me whole again, make me part of this reality instead of a glitch in it.

I'm terrified of that moment. But I'm more terrified it won't come. That I'll stay like this forever, conscious and aware, trapped in a world I can almost understand but never quite perceive correctly.

The laptop is the last real thing I have. When I close it, when I hit post, I don't know what happens next.

But I need someone to know this happened. I need a record to exist, even if it gets absorbed and rewritten like everything else.

And if you can't hear it, if you're reading this and realizing there's a gap in your perception that everyone else seems to fill effortlessly, then you're not alone.

I'm here too.

Still here.

For now.

AITA for ignoring her and believing instead that just has memory problems?","My housemate and friend (F25) has been brought to tears multiple times over 'things going missing' mysteriously in our flat, such as instant coffee 'disappearing faster than she could ever drink it', and the occasional fruit and vegetable. 

My other housemate (F26) and I (F27) have never had groceries go missing, and we've lived together for 2 years. My friend moved in 10  months ago. She is, in her words, 'losing her mind' and feeling 'unsafe in her home'. She has repeatedly told the story about how she was so resentful and fed up with her food going missing, that she compulsively ate a piece of one of the other housemates dinner that was sitting on the stove, before 'crawling under her bedding and crying in a ball until her boyfriend came to comfort her as she hid in her room for the rest of the day out of shame and anxiety.' 

Me and the other housemate have tried to hear her out, and hypothesize how this is happening when she raised it at first. But, she's been raising this repeatedly for a while now, and it's obviously causing her a severe amount of distress. 

I don't want to be heartless, because it's clearly upsetting her deeply, but, it's starting to feel like she's trying to force one of us to confess. Otherwise, we've told her we don't know what to say, but, she keeps bringing it up and mentioning how it makes her cry and feel like she's breaking down because she can't understand how this is happening. 

I have started ignoring her, and avoiding her as much as possible, because I believe she has mental issues. For example (one of many), she came into the kitchen on the verge of tears, demanding my other housemate and her boyfriend tell her if they know where her antique watch is. They said they didn't know, but she almost accusingly continued pressing, saying she has 'never ever taken it anywhere, she only takes it out of her cupboard to clean it and then put it back, so where is it?'. Yeah, it was in her jewelry box... so, it turns out she does put it different places! But in these cases, she will almost forget that she ever made the initial claim like 'I never move this item so it couldn't have been me!' and then move on as though nothing happened. 

If I tell her that I think she needs help for her mental health and/or continue to simply not care, not do anything to help, and no longer listen to her, even as I can see my friend is in huge distress, AITA? What if something really is happening (like, I don't know, the handyman who comes in once every few months! Idk, something crazy) and I'm gaslighting her? ",2,1759684150.0,AITAH,5,0.75,False

The diary chronicles the narrator's attempts to reconnect with Kat: putting away his phone, making eye contact, and showing genuine presence. Despite their struggles, they find moments of fragile connection as the world outside their Seattle apartment begins to shut down due to a pandemic.

**Excerpt:**

**April 10**

""Dear Diary...""

We saw the couples' counselor yesterday. Kat said she‚Äôd be willing to give things another shot if I made more of an effort. I guess that‚Äôs fair. I‚Äôve been buried in work for months now, coding late into the night, chasing deadlines no one but me seemed to care about, living off of Mountain Dew and coffee. She‚Äôs always called my computer my ‚Äúwork wife‚Äù and swears that I spend more time on it than with her. The therapist wants me to write down my thoughts, so here goes. Honestly, it feels dumb. But if it helps, then sure.

Anyway, this morning I woke up before the alarm. Kat was still asleep, curled up under the comforter like she always is when it gets cold. The city sounded normal, cars on the street, a garbage truck grumbling outside. Kat has always loved living in the city, but I've always thought it's too loud, the neighbors too close, the walls too thin. Especially when it's raining outside, which is, like, Seattle all the time.

Anyway, I made coffee and forgot to add sugar to hers. She still drank it without saying anything. I think we‚Äôre both tired of starting fights over little things.

I know we've been having a hard time, and, yeah, a lot of it is my fault... but I'd like to think that staying together is worth the effort.

**April 11**

Kat made pancakes this morning. I forgot she does that when she‚Äôs trying. They were good. A little burnt, but good. I tried to talk more, listen more. I even left my phone in the bedroom while we ate. It‚Äôs harder than I thought, stepping away from work. My brain itches for something to do, a bug to squash, anything to prove I‚Äôm useful. I‚Äôm not good at just‚Ä¶ being. But I sat there and nodded along as she talked about a painting she wants to redo. I asked questions. I made eye contact.

Baby steps.

Kat has always said that I'm too closed-off, that I don't ""let her in."" I'll try to work on that.

**April 12**

Kat said she likes when I‚Äôm really with her. I'm not quite sure I know what she meant, but I didn‚Äôt ask. She‚Äôs always been better at this kind of thing- You know... emotions. Maybe it‚Äôs an artist thing? One thing stuck with me- she said, ""You don't let me in.""

I think for her, presence means more than just being in the same room. It's about attention, about noticing things. Like how she changed the painting in the hallway, or how she's stopped wearing her favorite earrings. I miss stuff like that all the time. Too many browser tabs open in my head.

She said I used to really see her, back when we were dating. I don‚Äôt remember when that changed. Maybe when the deadlines got worse. Or when I convinced myself she‚Äôd always understand.

I guess I'm trying to close a few of those tabs now. She deserves that much.",2,1759684132.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

Three months of silence, and yet the weight of it was still unbearable. They had been inseparable since high school‚Äîsharing secrets, triumphs, and sorrows. But now, every time Olivia passed Rachel‚Äôs apartment or saw her name in her phone, her stomach twisted.

It all started at that party. Olivia hadn‚Äôt meant to say what she said. It was meant to be a joke, a harmless quip about Rachel‚Äôs new boyfriend. But Rachel had snapped really snapped.

""You think I‚Äôm stupid?"" she had shouted, her face flushing with anger.

Olivia had tried to explain, to apologize, but Rachel was too upset to listen. ""You always do this,"" she had said through gritted teeth. ""Always make me the punchline. You‚Äôve been doing it for years.""

Olivia was stunned. She didn‚Äôt know how to respond. Rachel had always joked about her own shortcomings, so why was this different? Why did it feel like everything she said that night was taken the wrong way?

The days after that argument were tense. Olivia had sent a text: *I‚Äôm really sorry for what happened. I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt you.*  
But Rachel hadn‚Äôt replied. The silence stretched, and with each passing day, the weight of unspoken words seemed to grow.

**Three months later, Olivia sat at a caf√© with her coffee growing cold in front of her.**  
She had been replaying that night over and over in her head, trying to understand what went wrong. Why had Rachel cut her out? They‚Äôd had fights before, but they always made up. Why hadn‚Äôt this one been different?

Her phone buzzed, and she almost didn‚Äôt look. But when she saw Rachel‚Äôs name flash on the screen, her heart stopped.

*‚ÄúWe need to talk. Can you meet me?‚Äù*

**When Olivia arrived at the park, Rachel was sitting on a bench, her posture stiff.**  
It was like time had frozen since the last time they spoke. Rachel looked older somehow, tired. Her eyes were red, and she wasn‚Äôt smiling like she used to.

Olivia hesitated, unsure of where to start. But Rachel spoke first.

‚ÄúI never wanted to cut you out, you know?‚Äù Rachel‚Äôs voice was quiet, almost vulnerable. ‚ÄúBut every time I tried to explain how I felt, you just brushed it off like it didn‚Äôt matter. Like *I* didn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù

Olivia felt a pang in her chest, realizing how she‚Äôd overlooked Rachel‚Äôs feelings, assuming she would always be the one who understood.

‚ÄúI never meant to hurt you,‚Äù Olivia whispered, her voice cracking.

‚ÄúI know. But you always thought you could say whatever you wanted and I‚Äôd laugh it off. It wasn‚Äôt funny anymore, Liv. Not to me.‚Äù

There was a long silence between them. Olivia could feel the years of friendship hanging in the balance, teetering between reconciliation and loss. She wanted to apologize again, to say she had changed, that she was different now.

But Rachel didn‚Äôt give her the chance.

‚ÄúI think we both need to be honest with ourselves. Maybe we‚Äôve outgrown each other,‚Äù Rachel said, her voice barely audible.

Olivia didn‚Äôt know what to say. She wanted to scream, to beg Rachel to understand. But something inside her maybe the years of unspoken tension told her that sometimes, relationships just weren‚Äôt meant to last.

**The finality in Rachel‚Äôs voice was something Olivia couldn‚Äôt ignore.**  
They sat in silence for a long time, each of them wondering if it was really the end. Olivia wanted to say so much, but all she could do was nod.

As they parted ways, Olivia realized that sometimes, even the deepest friendships could fade if they weren‚Äôt nurtured. She watched Rachel walk away, a bittersweet feeling in her chest, wondering if they would ever find their way back to each other.

**The next morning, Olivia stared at her phone, a text message still unsent.**  
*""I miss you, Rach. I hope one day we can talk about everything. But for now, I understand.""*

She deleted it before sending. Maybe some things were better left unsaid. Maybe some friendships just weren‚Äôt meant to last forever.",3,1759684030.0,story,0,1.0,False

I first met you when I was trying to forget her. Back then I was going through hookups to try and bridge the gap between lonely sleepless nights and scheduled crying sessions at the office. I was heartbroken but looking for something casual. You and I hit it off right away and I asked you if you wanted to be exclusive. It wasn't soon after that I opened up about my pain. For the first time after the breakup, I could cry to someone else and suddenly the floodgates were open. I cried so much, of the guilt I felt, and the trauma I had endured. While I was crying you reassured me, promised me you would love me, and wait for me until I healed. How I wish I stayed back then!

But I couldn't heal in your arms. I couldn't reciprocate your love. I chose to chase after my ex instead. You called it me missing the trauma bond, the codependency. I thought that I was doing something noble, righting my wrong, fixing what I had broken. And besides, you taught me what love was, maybe I can be better this time. But it was not to be. So soon after reuniting with my ex, I realized the stark contrast between the love that you offered and what my ex had in store for me, for even daring to come back. I was ridiculed and used. ""If you are guilty, then ACT like it!,"" she said. I realized quickly that this was no longer love because I had already experienced it with you.

The last straw came when my ex finally replaced me. After dangling commitment in front of me, so long as I courted her, spoiled her, and paid for her bills, I needed the strength to break free. When I was crashing down and still clinging on to my ex, I came to you for advice. It was our date that made me remember what love really was. That date at the museum with you made me feel free. When I told you we should stay friends, you assumed I was going back to her but in reality, I didn't want to get in the way of your new relationships, and you deserved better. I didn't want to get hurt so I gave you space again.

But your love was incredibly redeeming. Despite what happened between me and my ex, despite all my flaws and shortcomings, I was still loveable. I was someone you loved and eventhough you had someone else at that time, I carried it forward in my heart for the next weeks until we met again.

I would end things with my ex in the most chaotic fashion. There was a lot of crying, shouting, blaming, and begging (over calls, texts). I guess she never realized I had it in me to walk away from her disrespect. At some point, you and I would talk again and I was updating you with what was happening. My ex was inviting me to be casual but I was declining her offer to save myself from the emotional repercussions. You told me to not accept her disrespect. With you, I felt emboldened to draw boundaries with my ex. I truly had had enough, I just couldn't completely cut her away. When I finally blocked her, she took to using new cellphone numbers to harrass me and ask if I already had someone else so she could finally move on. I didn't, and I certainly didn't want to give her the satisfaction of using you as her scapegoat. This was between me and her and I finally had the courage to end things with no hope of ever returning. ""We are broken up. Please stop contacting me."" When you heard that, you were happy for me. I was finally free.

We finally began dating. At first it was fun. I appreciated you coming to see me and inviting me out to coffee, to a movie, to the rally. I was still feeling terribly heartbroken but your presence helped me process through my pain. My heart was still swimming in a storm of pain and betrayal but those dates with you helped me get closer to shore. My ex was receding in my heart and I was learning to have you there. But there was still a problem. Try as I might, I still couldn't reciprocate. There was something wrong with me.

I made up a lot of excuses in my head on why we shouldn't be together. That you weren't my type, that I was insecure about your body count but really I was afraid. I was reaching a point where my threshold for emotional care and empathy was running out. You know how you loved it when I was actively listening to you, keeping eye contact, empathizing, but giving good advice? At some point, I found myself performing. It was incredibly draining and what was scary was I didn't want to disappoint you. I pushed myself even harder to be present while I was getting sick, while I had work to do. I didn't know if it was because I didn't love you enough or if I still had love left to give. All I know was that I was spent and broken.

All this time, you looked at me lovingly. You wanted to take care of me and missed me when I was gone. I couldn't express properly what was going on with me without it turning into a fight. I didn't know how to have a proper relationship. My ex was my only blueprint. You and I would fight and I would blame you for pushing me when I wasn't ready. For making me feel trapped when I said I didn't want a relationship. And I hurt you so much with my words. And this was the third time that I was ending it with you. The third time that I was gonna hurt you and make you cry again.

I ended things with you because I realized I couldn't give you the love that you deserved. I would only end up using you as I rested in the sweet embrace of your love. But I couldn't stomach just taking from you without being able to give back in return. There was nothing in me left to give. I was burnt out emotionally. I am very sorry.

I miss you and I wish you well. I hope you get your new apartment where you and your cat can move in so you'll be closer to work. I hope you and your lola make up. I know how much you love her. I hope your foot gets better, and that you'll feel stronger soon. I wish you can find the best possible boyfriend for you. Someone who can love you deeply and completely, and not just parts of you, but all of you. You deserve only the best.

I wish I met you when my heart was well and whole but instead you found me furtively patching up my scars, checking for leaks, bleeding out emotions. I'm a mess. Here's me signing off on romantic relationships and focusing on my healing. I'm still in therapy, and I have plans to go on solo trips. No romance or hookups.

Years ago I (back then 26F) decided to buy a house with my boyfriend (26M), Mark. We just hit a 2 year anniversary, and we got a great opportunity to buy a property in a country we moved into together. This may sound like a rash decision, but the housing market there is very competitive and there isn't enough houses for people usually, so if anything went wrong we could really easy sell it with no loss.

Up until the point of the purchase our relationship was happy, we'd get into a fight every now and then but nothing too crazy.

To pay for the down-payment and other administrative costs, we used the money we got as a starting gift from my parents (important for later).

During the renovation we unexpectedly ran out of money, so my parents borrowed us another 20k or so which I afterwards paid back from my salary.

Once we moved in together things were really nice at first - I got a new, better paying job, we spent some nice time together exploring our new neighnourhood, we also finally had our own gaming room so we also spent some time playing video games together.

At some point Mark started spending more and more time on the PC. When I suggested we go somewhere nice during the weekend, he'd shrug his arms and say he'd prefer to just play games, but we can go if I really need to.

The same thing started happening almost every time we needed to leave the house for whatever reason. We'd go, I would be happy, he would just walk next to me with a bored look on his face, almost always with a phone in his hand and asking when can we go home because he wants to play with his friends. Family gatherings, friends outings, grocery shopping trips - the options were that I either go alone, or ask him to go with me and deal with him being grumpy the whole time.

Maybe you're thinking - well okay, but maybe you just always did what _you_ wanted to do, and never proposed anything that he'd like to do?

That's the thing - whenever I'd say I feel like doing something and ask him if he had any ideas, he would always say no. It was either me proposing an activity, planning it, reserving it in our calendars, paying for it and figuring out all the logistics, or us just sitting at home indefinitely.

And so I started going out myself. I had a friend, May, that I met at my new job. May was a sweet girl that loved doing DIY, so we sometimes met after work to spend some time together, do some crafts and chat.

To my surprise, I once came home after I went out by myself, and Mark gave me silent treatment.

I was really confused, and kept asking him what was wrong. He, initially just angrily shrugging and saying ""nothing"", eventually admitted that ge didn't like me going out and leaving him alone. This turned into an hours-long argument where I finally broke and told him how I felt about him being grumpy every time we go out, that I feel trapped in the house and feel like I am slowly losing contact with my friends and family.

He responded with: ""Then break up with me"" and left the room.

I slept in the guest room that night, crying. Next day Mark approached me and apologized for what he said, said that he loves me very much and doesn't want me to leave, and that he promises he will do better. I was still a little hurt, but eventually forgave him and we moved on.

He did make some effort to plan a few dates and we had a lot of fun, but after a couple months things went back to normal.

One day my mom called me and mentioned she's planning a surprise trip for my sister's birthday and asked us if we'd like to join. She would pay for all of it - flights, the hotel and food (I used to argue with her that I wanted to pay for myself, but this woman is really stubborn and this always turned into a bit of a fight so now I just always am very appreciative for her helping us out, and still offer to pay myself from time to time, though she still always says no and acts offended).

I asked my boyfriend if he wants to join, to my surprise he acted excited and said yes. He mentioned he'd never been to a country we were supposed to go to and he would love to go check it out.

And so few weeks later we arrive at the destination together, my sister is super happy and surprised to see us there (my mom didn't tell her anything other than ""pack your bag"" so she had no idea we would be there), we go to a caf√© and lay out a plan for our trip there.

The whole time we discuss where would each one of us want to go, my boyfriend stays silent. My mom even asks him if he has anything to add, a place he would like to go see, and he just mumbles no.

At some point we go to the hotel room and Mark acts all offended. He starts angrily telling me he hates this trip, because he doesn't get to do anything he wants on the trip and that my family just forces him to do stuff.

I, again super confused, tell him that we literally asked him for his input when we were planning the whole trip and he didn't mention anything. He said that's bullshit because we weren't asking genuinely, and that we didn't really care what he wants to do.

After some pushing, he finally admits there is a brewery he wants to visit. I make sure to plan it into one of our days, ask him if there is anything else he would like to see, he says no.

We all went to visit the brewery, which turned out to be just a beer shop. I double check the address, ask him if this is the place and he says yes, and maybe he misunderstood some info on their website. Nonetheless, we went in, me and my sister looked around and even bought some interesting sounding beers. My boyfriend went in for a minute, looked around and went outside to wait for us.

We then moved on to walk some more, and eventually my mom announces she has surprise tickets for a fancy lunch and she would like to invite us.

The lunch was amazing - it was a set menu of sandwiches, fruits, cakes and a choice between coffee or tea. Since Mark doesn't like either, my mom arranged a special menu for him with hot chocolate.

Once we were finished with the lunch and went outside, my mom asks Mark if he likes the trip. He responds with: ""This is the worst time I had in my entire life"". I heard it, and was stunned. This was actually the moment I realized that this is it. I am done. How can any person, after being treated to something, say something like that?

The rest of the trip Mark gave me silent treatment again. In the past I usually tried talking to him, apologizing and begging to talk to me, but this time I actually appreciated it.
I was mentally checked-out.

I spent the rest of the days enjoying the time with my family, celebrating my sisters birthday and having a good time. To my surprise Mark still followed us everywhere, chatted with my sister and mom, and the whole time didn't say a word to me.

When we went back to our home country, the silent treatment continued. After a few days, I called him downstairs and said that I want to break up with him. He looked at me, said ""okay"" and went back upstairs to his PC.

The next months were a bit of a blur for me - even though we didn't have the best relationship, I still loved him very much. I decided I want to keep living in the house and buy him out, so he moved out and we went through the notary proceedings. The house at the time had a lower value than all the loans we had. We agreed that I will take over his half of the mortgage and pay for all the administration costs, so he wouldn't end up in any debt.

At first Mark was okay with this agreement, but the closer the notary date the more fuss he made that I supposedly ""effed him over"" and am making a profit on him. I sent him all the calculations, trying to show him that actually I am doing him a huge favour because otherwise he would need to pay me back for the price difference, but he didn't believe me.

At the end we did sign at the notary, I agreed to pay him a few hundred extra to cover the real estate taxes he had for the last year and that was it. Or so I thought.

Few years later, I meet this amazing guy, my current boyfriend. I don't know what did I do to deserve this man, since the day I met him my life has become so much happier.

We decide we want to move out of the country, so I put the house on sale. Within the last two years the housing market went crazy, and the house is now worth a bit more that what we originally paid for it (around 20-30k profit).

When Mark saw the advertisement online, he sent me a message if I still don't think I effed him over, and that he ""gave me an investment for nothing and now he can't even buy a house for himself"".

Now I feel bad, but I also don't think I am doing anything wrong by keeping the profit for myself.

1nytkze,https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1nytkze/advice_for_first_time_consumer_founders/,Advice for First Time Consumer Founders,"Hey everyone, I spent the last 2 years co-founding Shortbread, which was in the YC W23 batch. I've recently left the company behind but wanted to share a condensed list of learnings and information that I would have found really useful 2 years ago.

# 1. Distribution

Distribution should be baked into your business. Brian Balfour‚Äôs¬†[four fits](https://brianbalfour.com/four-fits-growth-framework)¬†model: product‚Äìmarket fit, product‚Äìchannel fit, channel‚Äìmodel fit, and model‚Äìmarket fit, is a very useful way of thinking about it. It‚Äôs not enough to make something people want‚Äîyou also need to design it so that it moves through the right channels, with the right economics, to reach the right market.

You need to understand the unit economics of your business, meaning the¬†revenue and costs associated with a single customer.¬†Growth is a balancing act between CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), retention, and LTV (Lifetime Value). For the business to be sustainable, the amount you make from a customer (LTV) must be greater than what you spent to acquire them (CAC). The payback period, how long it takes you to earn this LTV, matters too in limiting your growth rate.

Make sure you know your ideal user persona and where they tend to gather (online and offline), so you‚Äôre not wasting time distributing to people who will never care.

Viral spikes are usually vanity. As with all top-of-funnel strategies and tactics, if the product is bad and users churn somewhere downstream then you‚Äôre just¬†[filling a leaky bucket](https://andrewchen.com/is-your-website-a-leaky-bucket-4-scenarios-for-user-retention/).

More useful is to build into your product¬†[growth loops](https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-loops), where each new user creates the conditions for more users to join.

Common growth loop mechanisms include social sharing, content creation, marketplace dynamics, community participation, or other network effects, but the key is repeatability and compounding. Pinterest is a classic example: Users sign up and 'pin' content to boards which are indexed by Google Images, leading other users to find this content via search or social, sign up to create their own board, and the loop repeats.

Distribution should be founder-led (doing things that don‚Äôt scale, an¬†[old YC maxim](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html)): emailing early users yourself, pitching the first sales calls, showing up in forums, writing the first blog posts. This is vital, because it‚Äôs the tightest feedback loop for learning what works and what doesn‚Äôt. If you can‚Äôt personally get distribution working, it‚Äôs unlikely a hired marketer or salesperson will fix it later.

>

# 2. Talk to users before you build

This is to help you know what problems are valuable to build solutions to, so that you don‚Äôt build solutions looking for a problem. ‚ÄúIf you build it they will come‚Äù is often dunked on for good reason, but, as they say, there is not much signal in the rejection.

A framework from Sequoia that I find interesting and useful states that for a product to find product-market fit it must ultimately overcome¬†[noise, habit, or disbelief](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/pmf-framework/):

Alternatively, two common ways to fail are building something that customers do not want, and overestimating the size of a market. Both of these are solved through talking to users; your goal is to understand the domain and the problem space deeply, as if you were immersed in their world and seeing through their eyes.

More specifically to building consumer products, success requires deep insight into the psychology of the individuals in your market, as opposed to the businesses. This is why a good starting place is to solve a problem that you personally encounter and understand intimately.

How to talk to users: follow 3 principles from¬†[The Mom Test](https://www.amazon.com/Mom-Test-customers-business-everyone/dp/1492180742).

1. Lead with their problem, not your solution. Avoiding mentioning your idea gives you the chance to learn about their world first.
2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future.
3. Feature requests should be understood, but not obeyed.

When you build and begin iterating, start small; it‚Äôs better to have ten people who love or hate your product, rather than a thousand who kind of like it. Build the simplest thing that could solve their problem and launch earlier than you want to, so you can challenge and validate your assumptions by having your solution in the hands of real users. You can launch multiple times, the ‚Äúone big launch‚Äù is fool‚Äôs gold.

As in life, your goal should be to maximize rate of learning; since you, as a startup, are¬†[default dead](https://paulgraham.com/aord.html)¬†and dying, everything rests on you learning enough before you run out of time. The way to maximize this is to run cheaper experiments, more often, and with reliable feedback loops.

# 3. Retention before growth

I‚Äôve been hinting at this but it‚Äôs important enough to merit its own section.

Unless you're building a lifestyle business with a product designed for churn (many AI consumer apps are like this, especially the ones that go viral on X for successfully using a guerrilla TikTok marketing strategy), you should just focus on building a product that retains users. There's a million tactics, playbooks, and hacks to try to be seen as valuable, but at the end of the day, there‚Äôs no hack to actually¬†being¬†valuable and therefore retaining users.

To that end, beware putting the cart before the horse: spending too much time developing a ‚Äúpersonal brand‚Äù, chasing virality via TikTok ramps / the vaunted Product Launch of the day, premature scaling, paid marketing.

To measure retention, build a cohort retention chart. They look like this:

At the very least you need to have a¬†[flattening retention curve](https://andrewchen.substack.com/p/lessons-learned-from-staring-at-thousands); it‚Äôs hard to build a business that eventually loses every user that‚Äôs acquired. Even better, you should research the benchmark retention of top performing products in your category.

Those numbers are incredibly high, but are telling of how strong the value and stickiness of the top percentile products (Facebook, Amazon, Spotify, Instagram, Notion‚Ä¶) are. Your early stage product won‚Äôt start out with retention this strong, but it shouldn‚Äôt be too low either (unless your CAC is super low, e.g. mostly organic growth)‚Äîsignificantly improving long-term retention is¬†[notoriously difficult](https://x.com/andrewchen/status/1293345830280159232).

This is because good retention is¬†hard. As Marc Andreessen once said, your customers‚Äô (screen) time is already all allocated. While you may be in a niche category, in a sense, you‚Äôre competing with the entire attention economy.

The 2 things you can do with the best chance of improving retention are:

* Improve your product‚Äîoptimize the UX, make it cheaper, increase top feature adoption, solve more problems
* Bend the curve earlier by optimizing for¬†[activation](https://www.elenaverna.com/p/hey-b2b-i-bet-you-are-measuring-activation)‚Äîthe magic ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment of your product, when value is delivered to the user

# 4. A startup is a war with 1000 fronts

You can't win all of the battles, you can't even attend to most of them; fortunately, the war is mostly decided by the few that matter. As with most things in life, assume a power distribution and try to be focused on the one most important thing, the 20% that will create 80% of the results.

Sometimes, you might not be able to see the most important thing because you're too focused on lower level optimizations: A/B testing landing pages and pricing options, running experiments on trial duration to improve conversion, and building the slickest personalized onboarding, when the highest leverage problem right now is fixing D30 user retention.

My recommendation here is basic: identify the key metrics you really care about and set aside regular time to align with your co-founder on high-level strategy based on the data. You should have a notion of the¬†altitude¬†at which you‚Äôre operating, and intentionally ascend and descend to regularly assess priorities. No detail should be beneath you; in my opinion, this is one of the most important things a founder needs to do,¬†maintaining massive context¬†across the surface area of the startup, up and down the organizational/technological/strategical stack. This is what the¬†[founder mode](https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html)¬†discourse was about.

More generally, this also means you should say be¬†saying no¬†a lot. Some common traps you should be rejecting: perfectionism / over-engineering, shiny but non-essential product features, caring about vanity metrics, attending vacuous networking events or idle VC coffee chats, hiring too early, premature scaling, and over-indexing on paid marketing before retention /¬†[PMF](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)¬†(product‚Äìmarket fit) is there.

>

# 5. Hire the right people

This is the highest leverage thing you can do as a founder, starting with your cofounder.

I think the one advice that comes before all else is don‚Äôt settle. You wouldn‚Äôt for deciding your life partner, resist doing so here as well. Like divorces, founder break ups are more common than you probably think and can get almost as messy; better to be solo than to find yourself entangled with a bad cofounder.

For all the time you‚Äôll be spending working together in such close capacity, you may as well be temporary life partners. This is why both your professional compatibility and your compatibility as people matters a lot, and also why YC looks for founding teams that have known each other a long time. Do you like this person? Can you see yourself working with them around the clock, every day, for the next 4 years? Do you trust them? Is this someone you‚Äôd want by your side when things are hard and your back is against the wall?

Aside from this, Paul Graham wrote about his most important attribute for a founder‚Äîbeing¬†[relentlessly resourceful](https://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html).

>

For your first employees, the same applies‚Äîdon‚Äôt settle, and don‚Äôt justify settling because you feel the pressure to scale up your team. Hire slowly, fire quickly. Have high standards.

The 10x engineer clich√© is trite but true: it's exceedingly rare to find an engineer who is strong or has aptitude for product, business, technology, and design, but a 4/4 is the unicorn that you should be searching for. They should be someone smart, hard-working, growth-oriented, agentic, and cares about their work.

Most likely, you won't find these people in your inbound. Look for them in your network, in strongly-filtered high-signal communities, and by cold-reaching out to them personally online.

# 6. Learn from others

Copy what works. You probably don‚Äôt need to innovate a unique Go To Market strategy‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämeaning how you get your initial customers and how you charge them. Research and copy the initial GTM strategy of successful companies similar to yours. The added benefit is that you will appear familiar to customers rather than radical.

A horde of founders before you have failed and succeeded in building technology startups in every domain and industry. You can find their stories on the internet and potentially avoid the mistakes they made, or duplicate the strategies that succeeded. Look for founder blogs, company postmortems, podcast and interview appearances, essays, VC blogs.

Even better, cold email them,¬†[follow up](https://guzey.com/follow-up/), offer to buy them coffee/lunch while you ask them questions to learn about their founding experience and listen for advice. When I was in Berlin at one point, my cofounder and I visited Ali Albazaz, CEO of Inkitt, at their office to ask questions about their early days. Despite us both operating in the same space, he was generous with his advice, and we learned a lot about successful strategies they employed.

At the same time, know that every start up is different and that the invisible details may be the crucial difference between one company's success and your flop, or vice versa. Don't average your advice, and be diligent in evaluating what you hear.

Lastly, don‚Äôt blindly fear competition‚Ää‚Äî‚Äästartups tend to die of suicide not murder. Unless you are in a truly winner-takes-all market, other startups working on your idea should give you some validation on the potential for product market fit. HubSpot built a $25B business in the face of Salesforce‚Äôs $250B one, amidst hundreds of others in the overcrowded SaaS landscape.¬†Good ideas are cheap, execution is everything.

>

# 7. Timing is critical

There are lots of fun analogies here. In a fast-moving river, it hardly matters whether you‚Äôre riding a log or a fiberglass kayak‚Äîyou‚Äôll be carried downstream all the same. Experienced surfers know to wait for the right wave to catch.

So too, with technological waves: they move in long¬†[S-curves](https://andrewchen.substack.com/p/the-mobile-s-curve-ends-and-the-ai)¬†that unfold over years, with different paths to success depending on whether you‚Äôre in the start, middle, or end of the curve. The right timing doesn‚Äôt guarantee success‚Äîbut the wrong timing almost guarantees failure.

>

This is the story of a lot of the biggest internet era companies. Reed Hastings pivoted Netflix to streaming as broadband and connected TVs crossed the threshold; YouTube rode cheap digital cameras, Flash, and rising home bandwidth to unlock UGC video; Instagram was native to the iPhone 4 era and took a winning bet on the fact that everyone would soon have a great camera in their pockets, capable of uploading images to the internet.

Form a thesis about where the times are headed, meaning what technological developments are happening, and how industries are currently or will be disrupted in reaction, based on research and talking to users. Figure out what is your differentiated proposition, how will you distribute it, and why are you and your cofounder(s) poised to execute successfully.

Now you have the foundation of your pitch when you go to court the investors in their game.

I swapped most of my products, always brought my tote bag, used my own coffee cups, and did almost all my own cooking. I also started thinking about going vegan (currently vegetarian) and I was about 85% plant based at that point. Now I‚Äôm about a month into college and living in a dorm, the amount of trash I‚Äôve produced is insane. First of all, we don‚Äôt really have a dining hall style cafeteria, we only have cafes and food court type of places, so everything to eat comes in a to-go container or pre packaged. I‚Äôve asked some places if I can bring my own cup and most of the time they say they don‚Äôt know and they seem weirded out that I would ask. On top of that I feel guilty for all the things I‚Äôve had to buy for my dorm. I‚Äôve thrifted some of it or just taken what some of my family members don‚Äôt need but I‚Äôve still had to order so many things. The worst part is most things like shower caddies and organizers are only really available for an affordable price at places like target or Amazon which I really hate. On top of all this, there aren‚Äôt really any stores near by and I don‚Äôt have a car so if I need non food items I usually have to order them online. It‚Äôs also been way more difficult to go vegan, since the vegan options are usually more expensive and harder to find (I feel like plant based is usually cheaper but I guess when it‚Äôs pre packaged it gets overpriced). I can‚Äôt cook for myself like I planned to because people leave the communal kitchen in a literally unusable condition. We also have a compost bin but it smells so awful that it seems like they aren‚Äôt really composting properly, I think it‚Äôs just a trash can for food waste, but it probably all goes to the same place. I guess the only saving grace is since i can‚Äôt drive I have to take the train everywhere but overall I feel awful about it. Is also harder to use soap bars because they get completely wet in the communal shower and are dissolving. I guess I‚Äôm not really asking for help I just wanted to rant about how wasteful college feels, especially when I‚Äôm required to live on campus.

I have a condition called Friedreich's Ataxia, which affects my coordination and causes clumsiness (ataxia) in my hands. This makes tasks requiring fine motor skills, like preparing a shot of espresso on a fully manual machine, quite difficult.
‚ÄãMy primary challenge with the traditional workflow lies in the puck preparation: specifically, neatly transferring the ground coffee into the portafilter basket and then tamping it evenly, without making a mess or losing material. 
‚ÄãCurrently, I own a Philips 2500 (I think that's the model) super-automatic. While the convenience is essential for me, I'm not satisfied with the quality of the espresso, which I find to be a bit thin and watered-down.
‚ÄãI am looking for a machine that can deliver a high-quality shot of espresso while accommodating my need for ease of use. Here's what I'm hoping to find:

‚ÄãEase of Use: My biggest priority is a machine or a workflow that simplifies or automates the process of loading the basket and tamping.
‚ÄãEspresso Quality: A significant step up from entry-level super-automatics.
‚ÄãSteam Wand: I prefer a manual steam wand. A machine with automatic frothing is acceptable, as long as it also allows for manual control.
‚ÄãMachine Type: I am open to higher-end super-automatics, semi-automatics, or even manual machines if there are accessories or methods that can solve my specific challenges with puck prep.

‚ÄãMy preferred budget is around $1,000, though I am willing to go more. My budget is more a personal preference than a monetary restraint. So don't put much weight on the price.

It wasn‚Äôt a question. It was a husky, awe-filled statement, my voice thick with a desire I‚Äôd fought for years. The proof was all over my fingers, glistening in the low light of her bedroom.

Mom‚Äôs head fell back against the pillows, a ragged sigh escaping her lips. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all for you, baby. It‚Äôs always been for you.‚Äù

Her fingers tangled in my hair, pulling me back down to her. My mouth found hers again, a messy, hungry clash of tongues that tasted of coffee and desperation. My other hand, the one not slick with her arousal, cupped the incredible fullness of her breast, my thumb circling a taut nipple through the lace of her bra.

I broke the kiss, breathing hard. ‚ÄúI found them. Your drawer. My boxers.‚Äù

Her eyes, dark pools of lust and something like fear, went wide for a split second before a slow, wicked smile spread across her face. No denial. No shame. Just a raw, primal honesty that shot straight to my groin.

‚ÄúWhich ones?‚Äù she whispered, her voice a low purr. ‚ÄúThe gray ones from Christmas? They‚Äôre my favorite. The cotton is so soft‚Ä¶ and it smells so much like you.‚Äù

Her admission, so blatant, so carnal, shattered the last of my restraint.

*

It had started an hour ago. I was looking for an old photo album in her room, something to show a friend. My hand brushed against the back of her underwear drawer, and I felt something that wasn‚Äôt silk or satin. Rough, well-worn cotton.

Curiosity, a strange, coiling feeling in my gut, made me push her delicate things aside. There, hidden beneath a pile of scarves, was a small stash of my own underwear. A pair of boxer briefs I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd lost at the gym. Another pair, the gray ones, stained with a distinct, darker patch at the front. They weren‚Äôt just stored away; they were used. The faint, musky scent of her arousal, mixed with the faded smell of my own detergent, rose from the fabric.

The door creaked open. ‚ÄúHoney, did you find‚Äî?‚Äù

She froze in the doorway, her eyes locking onto the evidence in my hands. A deep, crimson blush flooded her cheeks, but she didn‚Äôt look away. She just stood there, one hand on the doorframe, her chest rising and falling rapidly under her thin blouse.

The air crackled. The confession hung between us, silent and immense.

‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶‚Äù I began, but words failed me.

She took a step into the room, then another, her gaze never leaving mine. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help it,‚Äù she said, her voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre everywhere in this house. Your smell on your towels, your laughter in the halls. I lie in bed at night and I can feel you asleep down the hall. It‚Äôs agony.‚Äù

She was right in front of me now. I could see the rapid pulse at the base of her throat.

‚ÄúWhen your father left‚Ä¶ this ache just grew and grew. And the only thing that soothed it‚Ä¶ was pretending you were there with me. That it was your weight on me. Your touch.‚Äù

Her hand came up, trembling slightly, and brushed against the bulge growing in my jeans. The touch was electric.

‚ÄúDo you hate me?‚Äù she breathed.

In answer, I dropped the boxers and grabbed her, crashing my lips to hers. It was the spark that lit the fuse.

*

Now.

I tore at the clasp of her bra, freeing her magnificent breasts. They spilled into my hands, heavy and warm. I bent my head, taking a pebbled nipple into my mouth, laving it with my tongue, sucking deeply. Her back arched off the bed, a sharp cry tearing from her throat.

‚ÄúYes! Oh, God, just like that‚Ä¶‚Äù

My hands went to the waistband of her leggings. I yanked them down, along with her panties, in one frantic motion.

And there she was.

The most intimate part of her, laid bare. A lush, beautiful thicket of dark, curling hair, drenched and gleaming. It was wild, untamed, and utterly erotic. I‚Äôd never seen anything so perfect in my life.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so hairy,‚Äù I murmured against her stomach, my breath hot on her skin. ‚ÄúSo fucking beautiful.‚Äù

A sob of relief and need escaped her. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mind?‚Äù

‚ÄúMind? I‚Äôm going to worship it.‚Äù

I slid down the bed, settling between her legs. I buried my face in that soft, wet jungle, inhaling her deep, musky scent. My scent is on her, and hers is on my clothes, and we are a circle of want. My tongue found her core, parting her slick folds to delve into her heat.

She screamed. Her hips bucked wildly off the mattress as I feasted on her, my tongue tracing circles around her clit before sucking it firmly into my mouth. Her taste exploded on my tongue‚Äîsweet, salty, utterly addictive. I drove my tongue inside her, fucking her with it, as my thumb pressed rhythmically against her sensitive nub.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt stop!‚Äù she chanted, her voice breaking.

I didn‚Äôt stop. I redoubled my efforts, pressing my whole face into her, drowning in her. Her thighs clamped around my head as her orgasm ripped through her, a violent, shaking tremor that made her cry out my name over and over.

I kissed my way back up her trembling body. I was painfully hard, my cock straining against my jeans. She reached for my belt with frantic hands, fumbling with the buckle.

‚ÄúI need to feel you,‚Äù she panted. ‚ÄúAll of you. I need you inside me. Now.‚Äù

She finally got my jeans and boxers down, and my erection sprang free, slapping against my stomach. Her eyes widened at the sight, and a hungry sound rumbled in her chest. She wrapped her hand around me, her touch firm and knowing, stroking my length, smearing the precum beading at the tip.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so big, baby,‚Äù she moaned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve dreamed of this.‚Äù

She guided me to her entrance. The head of my cock pressed against her unbelievable wetness, nudging through that soft, damp hair. We both gasped at the contact.

I looked into her eyes, dark with a lifetime of hidden longing. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been more sure of anything,‚Äù she said, pulling my hips down to hers. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ take what‚Äôs yours.‚Äù

I pushed forward.

The sensation was blinding. An intense, velvety heat enveloped me, drawing me in, swallowing me whole. She was so tight, so incredibly wet, every nerve ending in my body screaming in ecstasy. I sank into her depths until our bodies were flush, until I was buried to the hilt inside the woman who gave me life.

We both went utterly still for a heart-stopping moment, our eyes locked, the immensity of what we were doing hanging in the air. Then a slow, deep smile spread across her face, pure bliss and triumph.

‚ÄúFinally,‚Äù she sighed, her body clenching around me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre home.‚Äù

It was discovered during his planning CT scans for radiation treatment, and the plan was changed to palliative care, including 10 days of gentle ""palliative radiation and chemo"" (who knew this was a thing?). I wasn't really surprised at the return either. Jack had been home for three weeks and his cognitive decline has been shockingly swift: disoriented to time and place (thinking it 1986, president is Reagan), prowling (without his walker) around the house in the middle of the night, opening every cabinet in the kitchen and dining room, trying to leave the house, agitated with me for trying to stop him, refusing help when he needs it most. He has a foley catheter that must remain for the duration of his life and he kept trying to disconnect the tubing from the leg stabilizer which led to multiple incidents of urine on the furniture. He actually went into the backyard and dropped his pants and underwear in attempt to disconnect the foley bag. He is unable to care for himself in the bathroom and made several terrible messes of himself, the toilet the walls, absolutely heartbreaking and again he became angry and dismissive of my attempts to help him. One morning he filled three coffee mugs with quaker oats in an attempt to feed our three cats. He attempted to put toothpaste on the foley bag when I asked him to brush his teeth, asking for lights to take his medication, not recognizing friends and family, etc. etc. and all this along with terrible weakness (increased difficulty with standing from a sitting position) and falls, like a gentle buckling of the knees bringing him flat on the ground. It's now 8-weeks post resection done on Aug 8 and was admitted back to hospital this past Monday for the advancing confusion and weakness and a few days ago moved to a sub-acute rehab. Just this week now he doesn't know who I am and does not know our daughters, although he smiles and appears happy to see us when we enter his room. He also is not aware of his situation (interestingly this has been since day one -- ie., he doesn't understand that he has a terminal illness, thinks he is in the hospital to help his brother who actually died over 20 years ago from ALS).  Jack sleeps most of the time now, is blissfully restful and sweet -- ie., he has no pain, no complaints, no concerns, but mentally gone (he does not even recognize himself in the family photos that I brought him). He has a strongly worded living will with strong DNR and DNI instructions for which I am grateful (we both had them updated in 2022).

Day 1 ‚Äî Touchdown (or: how I learned to love purple skies) 0700 GST ‚Äî Burn complete. The Gas giant, Rettlegeist 6741A, filled half the sky like a god-sized marble; Alsageist 6741B came up under it, all spiral scars and steam. Entry corridor was textbook: plasma-sheen, three small micro-shears in the atmosphere that felt more like a polite cough than death. Atmosphere: thin, metallic tang on the sensors, constant ion hiss on comms, and a background gamma carpet that made the dosimeter tick like a nervous metronome. Suit shielding held. Ship hull? A few fresh pings; she‚Äôll live.

0915 GST ‚Äî Rollout and recon. Rolled the lander into the wind-sheltered trough I picked from orbital scans. First boots on irradiated crust: crunchy, slightly luminous fines, and the air running through my suit started tasting like old batteries. Scouted a perimeter, deployed a pair of drones for radon and particle mapping. Baseline: high-energy flux as predicted; not currently lethal (thank you hazard protection,) just... insistent. Sent a very professional message to command: ‚ÄúI arrive. Send coffee. >:(‚Äù

Anchors set into sintered crust; had to treat the anchor points like temperamental sea urchins‚Äîpoke, pry, swear, win. Connected mobile life-support, external scrubbers online. Ran filter burn-in cycles twice because the dust here is entrepreneurial and likes to get into everything. Figures.

As someone who changed careers a few times, I'm now 40yo and looking to start a family in the middle of a housing crisis in Canada, in a country that is too cold for my liking 6-months out of the year. In SEA, I found hot climate, strong social fabric, cheap cost of living, and all the forests and wildlife I've always wanted to be around. I finally have a good paying job, a career I love that let's me work remotely (depending on the job) and now I'm ready to live where my purchasing power is much higher than in Canada.

My gf is in the Philippines, but is interested in traveling as well. I love Filipinos and their beautiful land, but it's corrupt, broken and disorganized. The simplest tasks are complicated by the most absurd idiocies. I spent a bit of time in Vietnam and even though people are a bit more high strung (I blame their insane coffee) it feels like a country on the upswing. Also open to other suggestions.

My husband and I are originally from New Hampshire and have been in San Diego for about two years. When we first moved, we found a furnished house in Lemon Grove through Furnished Finders and have stayed there since but honestly, we haven‚Äôt explored much of San Diego during that time.

We‚Äôre ready to move into something bigger and we‚Äôre looking for a 2-bedroom (3 if possible, though likely not in our budget) with at least 1.5 baths. Ideally, we‚Äôd love a place in a walkable area with restaurants and coffee shops nearby.

Our must-haves:
- Parking for 2 cars
- A/C
- In-unit washer/dryer
- Cat-friendly
- Feels safe (I‚Äôm home alone a lot when my husband is away for work)
- Somewhat central - we‚Äôd like to move out of Lemon Grove but not too far south (like Chula Vista). We aren't too concerned about our drives to work, but my husband is at Naval Base Point Loma and I am at SDSU. Where we currently are, my husband has a 30+ minute drive to work so would at least like to lessen that a little bit.

Budget: up to $3,850/month

We‚Äôve started touring but feel a bit lost with so many options. So far, we‚Äôve seen Ariel/Allegro in Little Italy (not for us) and Camden Tuscany, which we liked but the reviews were concerning. We have a tour today at Purl Apartments in Mission Valley, but I don't even know what other neighborhoods or buildings we should be looking at. I was really in love with the idea of living in Little Italy, but it doesn't look like our budget will allow for that at least from what I have seen.

1nysyp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1nysyp6/should_you_try_the_best_cord_organizer_lancord_c/,Should You Try the Best Cord Organizer LANCORD C for Appliances,"Testing out the Lancord LANCORD-C was a surprisingly delightful journey in the realm of cable management. Yes, I know, cable organization doesn‚Äôt sound thrilling at first glance, but this little handy cord organizer brought a kind of unexpected joy to my chaotic kitchen setup. As someone who often struggles with cords of mixers, coffee makers, and air fryers tangling into an unholy mess, I wondered if this would finally be the thing to restore some sanity. Spoiler alert‚Äîit did... though not without a few quirks to note.

**Sleek Design Meets Practical Usability**  
The first thing I noticed about this cord organizer was its simplicity. Its minimalist design, combined with soft rubber material, didn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúlook at me,‚Äù but rather blended into the kitchen without fuss. The rubber is soft yet feels durable, and more importantly, it‚Äôs not a dust magnet like some silicone-based options I‚Äôve tried before. I actually had the thrill (or perhaps frustration relief) of wrapping the cord of my air fryer onto one. It was smooth, and the organizer flexed just right to fit snugly against the curved appliance surface.

**Highlights**  
- Compatible with nearly any appliance‚Äîcoffee makers, mixers, air fryers, you name it.  
- Made with an eco-friendly rubber material that‚Äôs durable and safe.  
- Flexible enough to mold neatly on flat or curved surfaces.  
- Super sticky adhesive that manages to find the sweet spot between ‚Äúholds securely‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-damaging.‚Äù  

[Tested out some competitor brands? Not as versatile for curved surfaces, and don't get me started on adhesives that refuse to un-stick cleanly.]

[Check Lancord LANCORD-C price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0c5t5mq26/)

**Advantages**  
That adhesive deserves its own applause. I‚Äôve tried similar organizers before where either the adhesive peeled off after two days, or worse, left traces that haunted my appliances for years. The Nano Tape on this model sticks impressively well‚Äîtrust me, I even gave it a semi-yank test because, hey, curiosity. Afterward, removing it on an old coffee maker revealed the promised ‚Äúno trace left behind‚Äù result. Still, I‚Äôd suggest waiting the recommended six hours after application to really let it settle.

A few other merits had me nodding in approval:  
- Supports bulkier cords, from my monstrous stand mixer to a pressure cooker.  
- Works even on non-standard appliances like my daughter‚Äôs hair dryer (bonus points from her because finally no more ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the cord?‚Äù confusion).  
- Adhesive can be washed and reused‚Äîa rarity, especially at this price point.  

**Drawbacks**  
While there‚Äôs much to love, perfection isn‚Äôt achieved without a few hiccups. Testing this product thoroughly uncovered some limitations:  
- The adhesive, though strong, isn‚Äôt magical. On highly textured surfaces like woven plastic or unfinished wood, it struggled to hold as well.  
- It‚Äôs a bit of a dirt magnet during application. Until you adhere it, you might find dust sticking onto the Nano Tape which reduces its overall stickiness.  
- Even though you get a set of eight, I found myself wanting more for the sheer number of appliances in my kitchen. Yup, one set just wasn‚Äôt enough to satisfy my organizational chaos.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Struggled with heavy-duty cables on really old appliances. A decade-old blender‚Äôs thick wiring was just a bit too bulky to be comfortable on this organizer.  
- Doesn‚Äôt come with any additional adhesive strips for emergencies‚Äîyou‚Äôd need to figure something out if years down the road you wanted to shuffle them around appliances.  

**Comparing Product Competitors**  
There‚Äôs no shortage of alternatives to this cord organizer, trust me. Just skimming through similar options, I‚Äôd consider rival products like those made of standard plastics or silicone. But compared to those, this one‚Äôs eco-friendlier material and better flexibility make a noticeable difference. One product I tried in the past couldn‚Äôt contour to the curved side of my air fryer, whereas the Lancord LANCORD-C bent effortlessly. On the adhesive front, another brand‚Äôs supposedly ‚Äúindustrial-grade‚Äù sticker failed me within days of attaching it to my toaster. I haven‚Äôt seen that issue here‚Äîyet.  

However, in fairness, this isn‚Äôt the most heavy-duty choice for industrial-grade or office-sized setups. Some competing products are built explicitly for thicker cables‚Äîif that describes your needs, you might look elsewhere.

**Cost Efficiency**  
For the features packed into this product‚Äîreusable adhesive, soft rubber, and wide compatibility‚Äîit feels worth the investment. It isn‚Äôt cheap ‚Äúin a bad way‚Äù nor overpriced, finding a balance for most homeowners who want hassle-free solutions. I wouldn‚Äôt consider it budget-breaking by any means, especially since the functionality ensures long-term usage. It‚Äôs smart spending when you think about how much cleaner your kitchen counters will look‚Äîor at least mine do now.

So I live in the college hostel and basically had a huge fight with my roommates . It's a long story and I'm gonna rant . So basically I have been roommates with them since 2 years, we have been good friends , atleast on the face of it . During first year, they used to meet each other and their now friends circle( which at that time were just some strangers ) and never even called me to be with them, so the only good friends i have are from my class.I know there were clubs and other stuff but I really didn't think that I would have no friends in the future .
 Fast forward and I am in second year , and changed my branch so the people from my class ,not friends with them too . And also these guys still hangout , go for coffee and snacks and whatever,  don't invite me, saying that i don't know the other people present there ( they never introduced me to them) .I still didn't say anything , I always had a problem making friends and I just wanted to value whatever I had . 
Third year and they call me to stuff where it's like a group of people going but still feels like it's forced . I'm not good of a writer but just wanted to let it out , I don't even know if this is the right subreddit to post this. Today due to a silly reason my calm broke (mb)and I just shouted at them and told them that they have always treated me differenly, to which they disagreed, they shouted back,  and basically we are not on talking terms . I just feel so sad and lonely in this college . There are no people from my class or my room whom I can trust and be with. It sucks when you have roommates that pretend to be friends with you but don't like your presence . I just want to get over with this shiitty degree.

I‚Äôm a 41-year-old male from South Asia. Over the past few years ‚Äî and especially the past few months ‚Äî my health has really deteriorated. I feel like I‚Äôve lost my vitality, energy, and mental clarity. I‚Äôm looking for guidance from people here who understand Ray Peat‚Äôs ideas about metabolism, hormones, and nutrition.

üß¨ Recent Bloodwork Highlights

Total Testosterone: 282 ng/dL (borderline low)

Estradiol (E2): 60.5 pg/mL (high)

LH: 2.28 | FSH: 2.58 (both low-normal)

DHEA-S: mid-range

ALT: 71 U/L (elevated)

AST: slightly high

Triglycerides: 322 mg/dL (very high)

HDL: 34 mg/dL (low)

TSH: 1.43 | T3: 110.58 ng/dL | T4: 6.5 ¬µg/dL

PTH: pending

Blood Pressure: recently trending high


üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Current Stats

Height 188 cm (6‚Ä≤2‚Ä≥)

Weight 154 kg (was 136 kg three months ago; pre-COVID ~126 kg)

Waist ‚âà 50‚Ä≥ | Neck ‚âà 19.5‚Ä≥

Stronger and more muscular from consistent training, but still high body fat, especially belly and lower back.


üïê Lifestyle & Routine

Night-shift worker for almost 20 years (usually 2‚Äì3 AM bedtime).

Sleep: 4‚Äì5 hours, light and unrefreshing.

Training: 4+ days/week, 45-min weight training sessions.

Diet: Beef & chicken, white rice, broccoli, veggie salads.

Avoiding PUFAs, cooking mostly in ghee or coconut oil.

Sugar cravings: tea and coffee with milk + sugar, and a strong desire for sweets that keeps getting stronger.

Irregular eating pattern / ‚Äúweird relationship‚Äù with food.


No alcohol (haven‚Äôt drunk in years).

Occasional smoker.

High work stress and financial pressure.


üß™ Additional Context

Did an extended water fast (~5 days) a few months ago.

Took high-dose anti-parasitic meds (ivermectin) for 3 days.

Think I might be insulin resistant (rapid fat gain, high triglycerides, sugar cravings) but my fasting insulin came back in normal range.

Now experiencing high blood pressure on top of the above labs.


‚ö†Ô∏è Symptoms

Rapid weight gain (18 kg in 3 months).

Brain fog, fatigue, low motivation, poor libido.

Water retention, puffy face.

Emotional flatness, mild anxiety.

Possible fatty liver.


üí≠ What I‚Äôm Trying to Understand

1. How to reverse this estrogen-dominant, low-T state naturally without jumping to TRT.


2. Could liver stress, high triglycerides, and long-term circadian disruption be suppressing androgens?


3. Would improving metabolic health and sleep be enough, or should I consider pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, or gentle thyroid support?


4. How can I fix my sleep/cortisol rhythm while night work is unavoidable?


5. How to address my sugar cravings and potential insulin resistance through a Peat-style lens when my insulin labs look ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù


6. What key labs, foods, or supplements would Ray Peat followers prioritize to restart metabolism, protect the liver, and restore energy?

the newest controller from Junkfood Arcades, which has been a long time coming. basically a leverless with dual analog controls to allow you to play any type of game.

The ""thumb domes"" at the bottom are custom analog stick caps for hall effect analog sticks, designed so you can grip and push them from more angles. you can remove them however and use standard thumbstick toppers and stick grips, though depending on the combo they may sit too high to be comfortable. 

I tried some Thumb Soldier caps with them, and found only the shorter ones worked well. If you want to use a Kontrol Freek or the like it'll work, though a tall one might get in the way of the right side controls.

His F31 and her waste of space (no proper job) husband use our sky, amazon prime (did netflix until Netflix stopped it).

We are not well off, we both work full time. F31 have more meals out and take aways than we do and will buy expensive takeaway coffees every day. They recently bought a huge tv for their bedroom (they did have one). 

My partner has also just written off a 3.5 k debt that they owed him, despite giving them another ¬£600 a few months later.

We are having our 20+ year kitchen done (from savings). Part of this is having integrated appliances. I intended to sell the one relatively new appliance to help towards the cost.

F31 texts to ask for the appliance (they already have one) and partner asks if we can give it them.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Charlotte Hornets: Preseason Showdown of Champs vs. Rebuilding Hopefuls**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

The 2025 NBA preseason kicks off with a clash of narratives: the **Oklahoma City Thunder**, defending champions with a hangover from their parade, vs. the **Charlotte Hornets**, a team so desperate for playoff relevancy they drafted Duke‚Äôs star and bought a used Sion James on eBay. Let‚Äôs dissect this mismatch with the precision of a scout and the wit of a late-night host who‚Äôs had three cups of coffee.

---

### Odds Breakdown: The Math of (Almost) Certain Victory

The Thunder are **-7-point favorites** across most books, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.4 (-700)**. That translates to an implied **58-59% chance to win**‚Äîbasically the NBA equivalent of betting on the sun rising. The Hornets, at **+3.0 (33% implied probability)**, are priced like a last-minute group project in a statistics class.

The total is set at **220.5 points**, with even money on Over/Under. Given both teams are likely to tread lightly in preseason (the Thunder have a redshirt rookie making his debut, and the Hornets‚Äô new roster is basically a group chat of strangers), the Under feels like a safe bet.

---

### Injury Report: Thunder‚Äôs ‚ÄúAbsentee Ballers‚Äù

The Thunder are missing **Josh Green, Grant Williams, and Jalen Williams**‚Äîa trio so vital they might as well be the ‚Äúsupporting characters‚Äù in a Shai Gilgeous-Alexander origin story. But hey, Shai‚Äôs still here, and he‚Äôs fresh off a Finals MVP performance. Think of it like a rock band losing its backup dancers but keeping the lead singer‚Äî*still a show, just less choreography*.

Charlotte‚Äôs roster? A patchwork of hope. They drafted **Kon Knueppel** (Duke‚Äôs answer to ‚ÄúWhat if Michael Jordan played chess?‚Äù) and acquired **Sion James**, who‚Äôs either a future star or the NBA‚Äôs version of a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù in a Netflix true-crime doc. Seven players left via trade or waivers‚Äîimagine packing for a road trip and realizing you forgot your socks, your suitcase,

I‚Äôd be trudging along, coffee in hand, mentally preparing for the day, when a man on a bicycle would glide past.

He wasn‚Äôt just any man. He was impeccably dressed in a vibrant, mismatched suit‚Äîthink a purple blazer with green trousers. And as he passed, without slowing down, he would call out a single, hyper-specific compliment.

The first time, it was: ‚ÄúAstounding posture! You carry the weight of the world with remarkable spinal integrity!‚Äù

He was gone before I could even process it. I spent the rest of the day standing a little taller.

The second Thursday, I saw him coming. He locked eyes with me for a fraction of a second and declared: ‚ÄúA truly formidable coffee-cup grip! Unwavering!‚Äù

I looked down at my hand. I did, in fact, have a very secure hold on my latte.

The third time, I was ready. I saw the flash of color turning the corner. My heart beat a little faster. What would it be today? He cycled past, his voice clear as a bell: ‚ÄúExquisite rhythm in your walking gait! A metronome of purpose!‚Äù

And he was gone.

I was, by now, completely invested. Who was this man? Why was he doing this? He wasn‚Äôt flirting‚Äîthe compliments were too bizarre, too clinical, and he never stopped. He was like a wildlife commentator praising the unique traits of a passing animal.

I started to notice a pattern. He wasn't just targeting me. I saw him do it to others. He told a construction worker he had a ""commanding and efficient whistle."" He told a woman waiting for a bus that her ""sigh contained multitudes."" He was a Compliment Guerrilla, launching precision strikes of positivity before vanishing into the urban jungle.

Last Thursday, I saw him chain his bike up outside a nondescript office building. My curiosity got the better of me. I followed him inside, pretending to be on a phone call.

He walked into a small, dimly lit office with a frosted glass door. The plaque on the wall read: ""Bureau of Overlooked Virtues - Appointments Encouraged, Walk-Ins Welcomed.""

I pushed the door open. The man was sitting behind a desk, typing on an old typewriter. He looked up, not at all surprised to see me.

""Ah,"" he said. ""The metronome. I wondered if you'd stop by.""

""What... is this?"" I asked, gesturing to the office.

He smiled warmly. ""It's a regulatory body. We've identified a critical deficit in the recognition of minor, non-monetizable skills. The steadfast way someone holds an umbrella. The patience exhibited while a slow dog sniffs a lamppost. These are the virtues that hold society together, and they are going entirely unacknowledged.""

""My job,"" he continued, ""is field work. I gather data and distribute commendations. Would you like to file a report?""

He slid a form across the desk. It had fields like: ""Observed Subject,"" ""Time/Location,"" and ""Virtue in Question (Please Be Specific).""

I stood there, stunned. Then I thought of my barista, who always places the cup lid on with a perfect, satisfying click. I thought of the security guard in my building who has a uniquely graceful way of pointing people toward the elevator.

I sat down and filled out three forms.

Now, I'm a field agent. I don't have a bike or a colorful suit yet, but I have a notepad. Yesterday, I told a stranger at the park that I admired the ""authoritative yet compassionate way you threw that stick for your dog.""

The look of confusion, followed by a slow-dawning, genuine smile, was better than any thank you.

The world is full of invisible experts, masters of tiny, perfect things. My mission, should I choose to accept it, is to see them. And to tell them.

Imagine this scene: you‚Äôre in a caf√©, sipping your latte, and your friend says, ‚ÄúHey, send me 0.02 BTC for that comic book I just grabbed.‚Äù Instead of squinting at a string of 34 characters, copying, pasting, maybe messing up a letter or two, you just whip out your phone and *scan*. Boom ‚Äî transaction initiated. That‚Äôs the magic of QR codes in crypto land. But what if *you* could drop that same magic into your own app or website? That‚Äôs exactly where our free Bitcoin QR code API shines.

# Why a Bitcoin QR API is Your New Best Friend üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Long Bitcoin addresses (and sometimes ‚Äúbitcoin:‚Äù URIs) are begging to be mistyped or mangled. QR codes turn them into scannable art. Many crypto tools and wallets already support scanning QR codes ‚Äî so if you generate one properly, your users will thank you (in crypto).

Now, instead of asking your users to generate QR codes manually (or worse, paste addresses), your system can generate them on the fly. That‚Äôs the use case for our free Bitcoin QR code API. It‚Äôs like handing out magic wands that say ‚Äúpay me in BTC.‚Äù

# What We Offer (And Why It Rocks)

* It‚Äôs **free** to use ‚Äî no sneaky subscription required.
* It‚Äôs super simple: just hit an HTTP URL with parameters (address, style, size) and get back a QR code image.
* It supports multiple cryptocurrency styles (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, etc.) out of the box.
* You can embed it directly in your web or mobile app as an `<img>` or as a background ‚Äî it plays nicely everywhere.
* The service is delivered via HTTPS, so your users won‚Äôt worry that their QR codes are being snooped.
* It‚Äôs lightweight and low-latency, so it won‚Äôt slow your app down.

Here‚Äôs the API in action (copy-and-paste ready):

    https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/api/?style=bitcoin&address=1YourBitcoinAddressHere

Want to tweak size or style? You can. Want to support Ethereum or Litecoin too? Just swap the style parameter.

# How to Integrate (Without Freaking Out)

1. Generate your target URL (with address, style, maybe label).
2. Use that URL as the `src` of an `<img>` tag or fetch and embed it dynamically.
3. Display it at a decent size (say 150 √ó 150 px or more) so phones can scan reliably.
4. Let your users scan and send ‚Äî voil√†.

Because it‚Äôs a pure HTTP API, it ‚Äúplays nicely‚Äù with server-side, client-side, or hybrid apps.

# Use Cases That Make You Go ‚ÄúWhy Didn‚Äôt I Do That?‚Äù

* **Crypto stores, tipping tools, donations** ‚Äî show a QR and people pay.
* **Invoices** ‚Äî generate a QR per invoice, so users don‚Äôt copy long addresses.
* **User wallets** ‚Äî let them view and share their own receive-address QR codes.
* **Events / kiosks / pop-ups** ‚Äî put up a screen with ‚ÄúPay Me in BTC‚Äù QR and watch it happen.

For all that, you don‚Äôt need to reinvent QR generation or worry about scaling ‚Äî we handle that.

# A Quick Note of Caution (Because We Care)

QR codes are only as good as the data encoded. Always double-check that the address is correct before creating the QR, and display it with human-readable fallback (so users can verify). Since QR codes are static images, if someone tampers with them, users might scan a modified (fraudulent) address. So, combine visual display + address text + user confirmation when needed.

Also: QR code standards (ISO / JIS) are broadly accessible and unencumbered now, so generating standard QR codes is free and open to all (no hidden patents you need to license). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

I wanted to drink this Ilse I got but its still too fresh, so I decided to do a digging version of the pour I do. That way it can get a better extraction, more florals but not over extracted. Later after it rests some I intend to do the same coffee with a less digging but same center circle pour. I think these little details in coffee matter, like rest periods and ways to get or lessen extraction. I do try to grind the night before but it never does as well as the digging pour seems to for me. Irony is when its more opened up the digging can create bitters. But for today this was a good way and good cup!  ",1,1759681434.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 25 y/o female grad student living in the Center City/University City area. I‚Äôve been in Philly for about 3 years now, but most of my social circle is still tied to my program ‚Äî trying to branch out a bit!

I‚Äôm pretty introverted but love deep convos and definitely down for fun once I‚Äôm out. I love long walks (big fan of the Schuylkill River Trail), checking out new coffee shops, live music, reading, and slowly getting into film photography and climbing.

Also been toying with the idea of starting a casual Asian American interest group ‚Äî for convos around culture, identity, food, etc. Super chill vibes, and definitely open to everyone regardless of cultural background as long as you‚Äôre kind and curious.

1nysmi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1nysmi3/medication_and_returning_to_normality/,Medication and returning to normality,"Hello,
I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis and have an appointment next week to discuss treatment options. I understand everyone responds to differently to medication, however I have a question about life after medication. I‚Äôve been able to identify my triggers, all my favourite things, running, wine, spicy food and caffeine. 
Has anyone found that after starting medication they have been able to resume back to normal life (I know I‚Äôm being hopeful here). Cutting out alcohol and coffee is fine but it‚Äôs been a few months since I‚Äôve been able to run and I‚Äôm finding that the hardest. After each run I would wake up the next day in a flare. Has anyone experienced taking medication and being able to run, drink wine/ coffee and be pain free? 
Thanks in advance for answers!
