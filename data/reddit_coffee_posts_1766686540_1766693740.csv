1pvln57,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1pvln57/bob_culpability_richard_and_coopers_character/,"BOB, Culpability, ""Richard"", and Cooper's Character","So, I just finished the series for the 4th time this year about 2 days ago. I've watched it with two people now, both women (like myself), and I've noticed we've all come to a very different conclusion about the series and Cooper's character that I've seen nobody else mention or discuss.


So, I noticed that me and all my friends have come to the conclusion that by the end of The Return, Cooper is a complex character that we all agreed was more evil than we once thought after finishing the original series and FWWM. We all noticed and heavily discussed what seems to be his savior complex he has throughout the series, running through with Laura, Audrey, Annie, and Caroline. Of course, we know he ends the series by destroying Laura's ""happy ending"", aka her salvation from abuse in death. He ignores the very obvious and prominent fact that her father was molesting and raping her for years, and that he killed her. He just thought ""If I save her, I have done the right thing, because I need to save people"". Cooper had an innate need to save who he sees as helpless women in his life, when really almost all these women become helpless due to his actions (most notably Annie, Caroline, and in some aspects Audrey).


This is important because we all know that very important line in the episode Leland dies: ""Maybe that's all BOB is, the evil thar men do"". People often act like Cooper did no wrong, he was just a fun whimsical character who did a bunch of good for Twin Peaks, but I really almost feel like when you view the original series through a more modern lens (which I think Lynch obviously does with The Return), you start to see faults. He's a 35 year old man who wants to have a romantic and sexual relationship with a high schooler, whether she's 18 or not doesn't make it any less predatory. The only reason the relationship didn't happen was because Kyle himself had an objection to it (some saying because he was dating Lara Flynn Boyle at the time). His actions that he committed against Windom before he knew he was a homicidal maniac, which were at minimum falling in love with his partner's wife and a federal witness, at worst having an affair with one, caused a literal murder spree throughout the town of Twin Peaks because he chose to stay after solving Laura's murder (and yes, I know Windom was doing it partially to get to the Lodge, but a huge motivation is revenge against Cooper, even if he hated Caroline). 


Now, this gets me into Mr. C and BOB. The most common interpretation I see when it comes to BOB and Leland is that Leland, especially after you see FWWM, is culpable for the actions he's taking and its not only BOB. Leland wanted to molest Laura, BOB just made him act on his sexually violent, incestuous fantasies. I personally believe this, I think BOB is a representation of ""the evil that men do"" while also letting the men do the evil things they stop themselves from doing. What I always notice is that this interpretation is fully dropped for Cooper's character and his doppelganger when people discuss The Return. And I think that's flat out missing the point of the season. Mr. C is not just a vessel that BOB is taking over, it's a side of Cooper he never let out due to trying to be a moral lawman. We know he *wanted* Audrey, but didn't because he knew it was unethical. He still wanted to, though. Mr. C says that insanely important line in the beginning of the Return: ""I don't need, Ray. I want."" This is also a repeat of something BOB says to Laura in her diary. Mr. C isn't just a vessel for BOB, but it's also a vessel for Cooper's wants that he would never act out on himself.


This brings in culpability for the things Mr. C does. He rapes two women in his life, the high schooler who he pursued and his secretary. I think if we say Leland wanted to molest Laura and BOB just made him actually do it, how else do you interpret Mr. C raping Audrey or Diane? These were things Cooper wanted to do, that Mr. C acted out on. Cooper is, at the end of the day, a man. And this series examines the evil that men do. 


I also find it to be a very common story, as my friends and I discussed. As women, its insanely common for us to meet men who seem like kindhearted, good people, but end up being really bad people. Misogynistic, violent, whatever you can think of, me and my friends have experienced that with men in our lives. So to us, this idea that Cooper is a kindhearted, good man isn't a be all, end all of his character. It actually makes a lot of sense, considering the themes of this season, that Cooper is actually a bit of a fuck up and has the same evil dwelling in him that people like Leland do, which is why BOB finds him as a host. The Return is about how we can never return to the past because nothing will ever be the same, and I think includes Cooper's character. Lynch let you know him more, and in some aspects tried to make you regret it.


I think this would also be a good time to discuss Dougie. Me and my friends also came to the conclusion that Dougie is such a positive force in every person's life that he touches not because he is Cooper, but *in spite* of being Cooper. He loses all of Cooper's personality outside of his love for coffee and pie, and we see Cooper creating positive change in his life in a very real and tangible way for the first time in the series outside of solving Laura's murder (and even then, you can debate he fucked up a lot when dealing with her murder). I think Dougie is a positive force because it removes Cooper's savior complex for the first time, and lets the universe guide him to positive change instead of trying to force it and therefore making it end poorly through his forced actions.


This then brings me to Richard. Richard is a melding of Mr. C and Cooper, the two sides of himself that he may not want to accept, a good and evil. We notice Richard even has similar delivery to Mr. C in the scene at the diner, and we know he continues to have Cooper's savior complex rise to the top, thinking that ""Sure, I can bring this rape victim back to the home where she was abused her whole life, this surely will be a positive thing because I am bringing her back home"". Richard also brings back up Diane's sexual trauma, to get to this other ""side"", as Diane calls it, they have to have sex (presumably summoning Judy in the same way the character do in the first episode of The Return). This is horrible for Diane, because while she may feel that Cooper wasn't responsible in some capacity for her rape, she now has to have sex with, essentially, the man who raped her. It's a horrible thing that Dale does, I'd say almost outright, for selfish reasons. He does not need to save Laura, but his savior complex tells him he must, because all these women he saves are helpless in his eyes. And the way he tries to save them is by flooding two sexual assault victims with the memories of their trauma. How does this make things better? How does that heal the hurt that men do? It only exasperates it, showing that in some capacities, in spite of his good intentions, Cooper has the same evil in him that all men do.


I probably have more to say on this, because I truly think this is an essential reading of the Return, but I wanted to see what other people thought and if anyone else gathered this from the Return. To me and my friends, this felt like the reading that made the most sense. You can get more Cooper, but he's not gonna be the man you thought he was, because nobody in the Return is who you thought they were 25 years ago. This is also to say, I do think Cooper is complex! This is not to say he is outright evil one way, or outright good in another. I think the actions taken by all versions of Cooper are his in some capacity, that were held back or not done because of his good intentions or due to a lack of certain characteristics (in reference to Dougie). So yea, let me know if you think I'm insane.",4,1766693247.0,twinpeaks,1,0.83,False
1pvlmt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pvlmt8/the_naughty_list/,The Naughty List,"**I was 10 years old when I realized everything I knew about Santa Claus was wrong.**

Before that, Christmas was something I tried not to hope for too much. My mom worked long hours, sometimes two jobs at once, and came home smelling like bleach and coffee grounds. She always decorated the apartment anyway. A crooked tree from the discount lot. Lights that flickered if you breathed on them too hard.

The presents had been getting smaller every year. Socks. A paperback book. One year, a toothbrush wrapped like it was a joke. My mom always apologized, her eyes shiny, saying things would get better.

I told her it was okay. But I knew why it was happening.

Santa had decided I was not good enough.

That changed when Travis Murchison told me the truth behind the bike racks after school.

“Santa is not real the way they say,” he whispered. “He is the devil.”

I laughed at first. Travis was the kind of kid who liked scaring people. But he leaned closer. “Think about it. Bad kids always get the best stuff. My cousin lit a mailbox on fire and got a dirt bike that year. Nice kids get skipped. Why would the devil reward goodness.”

I did not sleep much that night. I kept replaying the last few Christmases. Every time I tried to be polite. Every time I helped my mom without complaining. All that goodness had earned me nothing.

If Santa rewarded bad kids, then I had made a mistake. So I started fixing it.

I stole candy from the corner store. I pushed a kid down the stairs at school and told the teacher he slipped. I broke a neighbor’s window and blamed it on older kids.

My mom noticed. Of course she did.

She grounded me. She cried. One night she grabbed my shoulders and said, “Please tell me what is wrong. I do not recognize you anymore.”

I almost told her. But Christmas was too close.

On Christmas Eve, she fell asleep on the couch still wearing her work uniform. I lay in bed listening to the building creak. Around midnight, something heavy moved on the roof. Not footsteps exactly. More like dragging weight.

Then the living room glowed red. Red like something alive.

I crept into the hallway.

A figure stood by the tree. Tall. Bent. Wrapped in dark fur that looked burned instead of dyed. The air smelled like smoke and cold metal. I saw horns, not antlers and not decorations, curling beneath its hood.

It dropped a sack at the base of the tree. The sound was wet.

I shut my eyes. When I opened them again, the room was dark.

In the morning, the presents were real. A game system. New clothes. Toys I had only seen in commercials.

My mom sobbed. She told me she had been working nights for months, hiding the money, saving every dollar so I would not feel forgotten.

I hugged her. I told her she was the best mom in the world.

I never told her what I saw.

Now that I’m older, I know better. There is no Santa Claus. There is no devil sneaking down chimneys. There is only each one of us, choosing day by day who we’re going to be: good, bad, or something in between.

Still, on certain winter nights, when the wind scrapes the shingles, I wonder who I saw that night in the living room, and if he's ever coming back.",1,1766693220.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1pvlmpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1pvlmpt/christmas_alone_but_relieved/,Christmas Alone- but relieved,"I'm reading Al-Anon's 12 steps and 12 traditions today. I'm also reading loving my actual Christmas. This is a really long vent post- really just wanted to get things off my chest and process some of my holiday alcoholic trauma.





My first marriage ended on Christmas Day in 2013. 

  
I promised myself I would never spend another Christmas like that, alone, resented and blamed. Like no matter how hard I worked to be the perfect wife my holidays are doomed. I deserve better. He is now in recovery and happily remarried. Processed that in therapy, yay! I don't accept responsibility for anybody's drinking, ever. I spent time with our teenager yesterday and today they are on a family day trip, they go see step mom's relatives on Christmas Day.

  
My husband is in jail today. I love him and miss him and resent him.



I have so much grief and trauma about the holidays and alcoholism including losing my favorite cousin near Christmas to alcoholic asphyxiation around the time my first marriage ended. Things like my alcoholic abusive stepdad walking out for good near Christmas when I was a kid. Looking back- dad leaving was a huge blessing but so much to go through.



  
My husband is 14 days sober today. I'm so relieved and happy but so sad and scared and resentful at the same time. 

I was listening to all those YouTube when is enough enough videos and have read if you love me you'd stop drinking. That was just riling me up more.

  
His substance use and alcohol issues have caused him to be justice involved. He's been in and out of court for most of this last year. He had a 10-day sentence that turned into getting no bond issued for an older DUI. He's six months sober from other substances. His parents tried to tell me what was going on with his case so that I could decide if it was too much and I wanted to leave him. His dad is a narcissist and always seems to secretly be delighted when husband looks bad. Our parents are not a valid reason for drinking though, we are in our 40s and have had plenty of time to process our childhoods.



I was not pleased to learn about him skipping out on an older DUI. But he told me before his parents did. I was angry that he waited until after we were married to be open and honest about the extent of his justice involvement. He decided to be transparent- NOW.

 I've read his depositions, I've seen everything in the open. I let his parents know I appreciate their concern (which is actually manipulation) and can't share husband's confidential court documents with them.

He's encouraged me to talk about it with my friends, and seek support and has discouraged a lot of the secrecy that alcoholics tend to treasure. I work in harm reduction and grew up with addicts and from a personal perspective I don't know if he'll be sober forever but I hear the internal shift. This is everything I've been praying for, for a year. 



I started to project how angry I am at him this morning. I said I guess my only problem is I fall in love with alcoholics. We were video chatting and I was sharing our dog, our tree, and our son playing with his new gifts. It triggered me so bad that he wasn't there and isn't here with us.. when he said I'm sorry I don't remember much of what happened when I was drinking and I jokingly said so that means I'm not allowed to hold it against you huh? I got angry. It reminded me of the exact same things my ex-husband said during our divorce.

He didn't take it personally. He said he knows this can't be easy on me. He hopes I'm relaxing and enjoying the holiday as much as I can. He keeps asking me if I'm resting, if I've eaten, if everything is okay with the house. 

I am angry at myself for being angry. I just want to let go and forgive him and support his recovery and rebuild our marriage.

From the outside our life is really lovely. Our home is paid off. I have an excellent career, brand new vehicle, a private office with my own assistant. My husband is very handsome, clever, romantic, outdoorsy, masculine but sensitive, tall and sexy and everything I always promised myself I'd have in my life partner. I'm mad at myself for being miserable because my life used to be terrible with severe poverty, abuse, health issues, at one point I was even badly overweight due to depression in a controlling relationship. We both had horribly traumatic childhoods. I am so committed to being healthy that my recovery borderlines on fanatic. Tons of mindset and therapy and healthy clean eating. I am constantly being told that people admire my strength and grace. Well I don't feel freaking grateful or graceful or strong today.

  
I'm not happy I keep telling him. He keeps being gentle and saying I love you and I miss you first. He's aware he might have self-sabotaged me into misery and resentment. I'm trying so hard to let go of it and forgive him and he knows this. I love him and I don't want to separate.

He isn't dodging accountability. He isn't pretending everything is magically okay. He's been scared that I'm going to leave him over this.

  


Him being sober makes me so happy I want to cry and it's disturbing how something so simple makes me happy. The husband I fell in love with treated me like a queen and was very attentive to me, prioritized my happiness and accepted my flaws. Just the way he is now. I'm hurt because he kept saying he didn't need a rock bottom to recover but damn. Before he went in to jail he expressed that this was the way he wanted to get sober. It doesn't matter that I could refer him to a beautiful inpatient facility where I could still see him and hug him and not just video chat him. He wanted to do this his way, and almost drank himself into an early grave on the way there.

His best friend told him that his plan to get sober by going to jail was the stupidest sh\*t he ever heard. I agree but want to support him however he recovers.  Other friends have said at least he's dealing with this old case now. Husband and I laughed about that this morning on the phone, actions have consequences and no it's not a good thing for me. This case happened years ago, but I'm here to help pick up the pieces and support my husband. He keeps saying that he knows we'll get through this. Oddly enough I thought I wanted to be done and was checking out but I keep falling more in love with him. I'm so proud of the strength he is showing in getting sober and admitting he is powerless over his addiction and needs help.

  
I feel like crying because I'm depressed from missing him but so relieved that he sounds like my husband again, I've missed him so much. 

He told me he knows I'm finally able to catch up on rest and peace at home because he's not having alcoholic outbursts. He told me he knows I'm saving a lot of money because I'm not supporting him or his habits. Every time I ask him how he's holding up during Christmas in jail he is optimistic and says things like well there was some really nice coffee. I feel like a jerk for being cranky!!

For some reason he got it into his stubborn head that detoxing in jail was how he is going to be sober. Months ago he had said that when we got pregnant he would quit drinking, but I put having a baby on the back burner so we could focus on my well-being and his recovery. We are not trying for a baby now. That breaks my heart too, even though I know that rejection is God's protection.

  
I shared with him that I had an ectopic pregnancy loss about 6 years ago during the holidays and having an empty womb and empty heart is painful. Things are always bittersweet with me- I got pregnant the next month and my beautiful sweet son is 5. 



 Thankfully I have an excellent support system and therapeutic support but can't exactly call my therapist today and don't want to bother my life coach on Christmas Day. I do have access to crisis support but am more just frustrated and needed to get things off of my autistic traumatized chest. Some of my friends volunteered to be my support system for Christmas but this is kind of a lot to trauma dump.

1pvlkqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/codeforces/comments/1pvlkqv/save_money/,SAVE MONEY,"How do I start saving money?

Begin with expense tracking. The first step to start saving money is figuring out how much you spend. Keep track of all your expenses—that means every coffee, household item and cash tip, as well as regular monthly bills. Record your expenses however is easiest for you—a simple spreadsheet, free online spending tracker or app, or even pencil and paper. Once you have your data, organize the numbers by categories, such as gas, groceries and mortgage, and total each amount. Use your credit card and bank statements to make sure you’ve included everything.                                                                                                                            How do I save money on a tight budget?

Economize on wants. If you can’t save as much as you’d like, it might be time to cut back on expenses. You can get ideas on where to cut by seeing how your spending compares with everyone else’s.



First identify nonessentials, such as entertainment and dining out, that you can spend less on. Then look for ways to reduce your fixed monthly expenses, such as your car insurance or cell phone plan. Other ways to save money every day include:



Search for free activities

Use resources, such as community event listings, to find free or low-cost entertainment.



Review recurring charges

Cancel subscriptions and memberships you don’t use—especially if they renew automatically.



Cook your meals

Plan to eat most of your meals at home, and research local restaurant deals for nights that you want to treat yourself.



Wait before you buy

When tempted by a nonessential purchase, wait a few days. You may realize the item was something you wanted rather than needed—and you can develop a plan to save for it.



What kinds of savings goals should I set?

Use goals to make saving meaningful. Working toward specific goals can be one of the most effective ways to save money because it puts a reward or accomplishment in sight. Start by thinking about what you might want to save for—both in the short term (one to three years) and the long term (four or more years). Then estimate how much money you’ll need and how long it might take you to save it.

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1766692830.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

1pvlgo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightlossJourney/comments/1pvlgo2/struggling_to_loose_weight_again/,Struggling to loose weight again,"Hi! I'm a 20 yr old female who is 5'10 and weighs 155-156 pounds. Between March and August I managed to loose 30 pounds, getting to my lowest weight of 152 pounds. I was eating in a calorie deficit (1500-1600 daily) and walking 15,000-20,000 steps daily.

However, I went back to college in August and kept the weight off until I started to get back into my habit of binging. Following this, I met someone and we started to go out to eat dinner a lot. My final week before winter break I had a terrible over-eating week with 3000 calories daily and one day where I might have doubled / tripled it (I'm so embarrassed about it, but things happen and I'm getting over it). When I came home, I just felt like I had put all the weight back on even though my scale hasn't gone over 157 pounds. I know I feel much bigger than I am, but my mind is making me feel as if I'm back to the 180 pound self I was prior to summer.

Coming back home for winter break, I wanted to lock back in and loose the weight I gained. I came back on December 9th. Since then I've eaten 1400-1500 calories daily, getting 15,000 steps daily. I've also been doing reformer pilates throughout the past couple months and between the 9th and 18th I've gone 8 times. I'm aware that's a lot but I needed to catch up for my subscription. I feel like I've worked so hard for over a week now and the scale won't budge and I feel like I haven't changed where I want to. I'm perfectly content with my arms and legs, but my stomach area just feels like it's not loosing any weight. It's not even that fact that my scale won't really move that is making me feel frustrated, it's the fact that in myself I'm not seeing the progress.

In the summer, I was loosing a .75-1 pound a week and now I'm not seeing ANY progress on the scale. Yes, I've gained muscle in my legs and arms which maybe won't budge the scale, but I just feel larger in my lower chest / stomach than I was in the summer. Also, I'm aware that 155-56 is a good weight for someone who is 5'10, but I just want to be content with myself and loosing this last bit will make me feel better.

This weekend I'm not going to be walking as much and I'm not doing pilates for at least 4 days, so my body will be getting a rest. I'm hoping maybe this will help?

In terms of my calorie deficit, I'm very strictly staying at 1400-1500. I use a scale to calculate everything is grams. I prioritise whole foods and have eliminated artificial sugars from my diet, the only sugar I use now is 3-4 tbsp stevia in the raw in my black coffee every morning.

Food is also a big part of who I am. I'm constantly thinking about it and always want to eat. I eat even when I'm not hungry and I don't know how to stop this (however I eat within my deficit). Every factor is making this mentally harder and harder to loose the weight.

I don't know what else to do and I'm getting so frustrated. Can anyone help or had a similar thing when it comes to re-loosing weight?

Hi, I could really use some neutral opinions because I feel like I’m losing clarity.
I (23F) met this girl through volunteering. We’ve seen each other around 6 times, always in group/volunteer settings, not really one-on-one for long conversations.
I’ve developed a crush on her, but I genuinely can’t tell if there’s anything on her side or if I’m projecting.
Here are the facts, trying to stay objective:
Things that feel confusing / possibly flirty:
She hugs me very tightly and for a long time (only me, not others)
She’s touched my shoulders when saying goodbye
Strong eye contact, warm smiles, sometimes what looks like a wink (but I’m not 100% sure)
She once said she “adores” me
While talking about her apartment, she mentioned that when she comes back from a trip she’d invite me over for a coffee (her idea, not mine)
Things that point the other way:
She’s inconsistent over text: sometimes warm, sometimes slow or no reply
She didn’t reply to a simple “Merry Christmas” message
She doesn’t really initiate conversations
She doesn’t engage much with my social media
We’ve never clearly talked about queerness, and I don’t know if she’s queer at all
So my questions are:
Does this sound like normal friendly behavior to you?
Am I likely projecting because I like her?
Is it reasonable that it’s just too early / unclear, or does this read as disinterest?
Would you advise asking her out directly to get clarity, or backing off?
I’m honestly fine with either outcome — I just want to stop overthinking.

I just started working as a cashier at Panera and I’m still in my first few shifts. I’m not a native English speaker, and I’m realizing that a lot of the job relies on “unspoken rules” that weren’t really explained during training.

Here are some things I’m confused about and would love advice on:

⒈Default sides for sandwiches & salads

I learned that most sandwiches and salads come with a side (usually chips). If a customer doesn’t say anything, is it generally safe to assume chips? Should cashiers always confirm, or do regulars expect the default without being asked?

⒉Sip Club confusion

Many customers order at the kiosk and then come to the counter asking for a cup.

As a cashier, what’s the safest way to confirm whether someone actually has Sip Club without checking the system every time?

⒊Which drinks require giving a cup

From the POS, it looks like bubbler, iced

coffee, hot coffee, etc. How should I know which one is self-serve and I need to give them a cup actively as a cashier?

⒋Names & calling orders

I often struggle to understand or pronounce customer names. Is it okay to ask everyone to spell their name, or to call orders by spelling the letters instead of pronouncing?

5.Dress code flexibility for new hires

I was told I need all-black shoes and a black top, but I didn’t have the right shoes on day one. How strict is this usually for brand-new hires?

I really want to do well and improve quickly, but a lot of this feels like “you just learn it by being there.” Any advice from experienced Panera employees or other cashiers would really help. Thank you!

Ice production speed is legit: first batch is about 6 mins for 9 pieces, assuming the unit and water arent starting warm. Daily output capacity being rated at 26 lbs/day feels possible if you keep cycling the ice out into a freezer, because the ice storage capacity in the bin is only enough for a small pile before it starts recycling and melting. Cube size and shape are the typical hollow bullet ice, thin walled, easy on teeth, not “cocktail bar” cubes.

Portability and handle design is actually useful. At 13.7 lb it’s easy to move, and the handle helps if you’re hauling it to a cabin or camper. Setup was simple: rinse, fill, plug in, hit start. Included accessories are nice for the price bracket, mine came with the 10 ice bags plus a scoop.

Noise level is low-ish, more fan and water movement than compressor clunking, though I did notice a bit more noise during the dump cycle. Counter space fit is decent: about 11.6 x 8.7 footprint, so it tucks next to a coffee maker without taking over the kitchen.

Water refilling process is the usual manual top fill. Plan on refilling often if you’re chasing max output. Self cleaning functionality helps, but it’s not magic; mineral scale still happens, so preventative maintenance matters. Maintenance difficulty stays low if you wipe it out, drain it, and run a mild descaler now and then.

Temperature performance is the weak spot for these machines in general. Ice comes out wet and not fully freezer-hard, so it can clump into one big lump in a freezer bag later. Reliability over time looks mixed from other owners: one person had it quit before a year, another had failure around 7 weeks with cubes jamming under the moving water tray and forcing power cycles. That jam issue bugs me as a tech, since stalled motors cook parts.

Power consumption seems reasonable for a small portable ice maker, but it will run a lot if you keep it fed. Price sits in that cheaper countertop ice maker range, competing with other 26 lb/day units, though longevity is the question mark.

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands. ideally near Amsterdam or within 30 mins commuting!

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

**Tl;dr: Am I alone in:**

**a)  loving confrontation because it's stimulating, then promptly OVERstimulating myself so much I stop functioning?**

**b) overpreparing, overstretching myself and then regretting everything when the occasion actually comes?**

I am a confrontational person at heart. I can't sugarcoat this. I am the kind of person that will stand up to a bully without thinking, I'm raring for a fight for a cause. But I also have ADHD. And that means I don't exactly think before acting.

I love Christmas. I love preparing and giving gifts, I've planned out what to cook for Christmas dinner. But I also have ADHD. And that means my ambitions weren't exactly realistic.

My partner has a big family. Most of them are nice, if chaotic and loud. But some of them are... okay, they're twats. Big, self-absorbed, nosy twats. They've made comments about me and my partner (""how dare, they live together without marriage?!""), they are bigots, and while the rest of the family makes fun of them and ignores them, that little confrontational goblin inside me made it my primary mission to stand up to them. I've even bought a dress that was both pretty and elegant and unconventional enough to make them seethe internally at the sight.

Day before Christmas came. First ""uh oh"" moment. I've made one dish and my focus was gone. I SUFFERED through making the second. My partner helped me through but I was already overstimulated and defeated. It was at this moment, dear reader, when I realized I fucked up.

And there comes the dinner. ""Uh oh"" number two. I was so ready to fight... and The Twats didn't come at all. Only one of them was present and he didn't even deign to sit at the table. But there was another Enemy #1: my partner's cousin. He treated my partner like shit, and you just don't treat my loved ones like that.

The inner goblin zeroed in on the target, but I was SPENT. People were loud, I couldn't focus on any of the simultaneous conversations, I dissociated, and I only bit back when the cousin tried to rile me up. I drank my 10 pm coffee, almost fell asleep at the table, went back to my mom-in-law's house and stress ate half of the pantry.

It's the day after Christmas. I am exhausted. Confrontation came and I was not able to rise up to the challenge. I am overstimulated as fuck. I was so excited to prepare for Christmas that I prepared, deflated and crawled through it when it actually came.

I am so done. Thank you for reading.",1,1766692296.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

But, I decided to expand the home setup. Picked up a Mavo Phantox Pro, a knockoff Hario Switch style dripper, and a MHW-3Bomber gooseneck kettle and carafe. I know a lot of people hate the loud branding of MHW-3Bomber, and I don't disagree. But, I've been pleased with the quality of their spring-loaded tamper and milk pitcher. I think they offer good bang for the buck. And I didn't want to dump a ton of money into the hobby before knowing if I would like it.

I tried it out for the first time today, and wow...totally different coffee experience. I've never been one to drink coffee black. But, this was honestly unlike anything that I've had previously. I know that it was my first go, so, it will only get better with more practice. But I have to say, I am really happy with how much clarity there was for my first attempt. So happy that I decided to explore pourover, and more specifically, the expanded pourover / immersion options with the Switch style dripper.

I used some Ethiopian (Chelbesa) washed beans from Morrow (Spain), which I already had on the go for my caps. Medium to medium-light roast. 20g ground at 6.5 setting, and brewed at a 1:16 ratio (320g out). 93C water. First approx 30 sec pour 50% with switch open, closed the switch at 45 seconds, second pour approx 30 sec of 50%, and let it steep for the remainder of the 2 minutes. Then opened the switch, let it drain, and enjoyed it. Honestly, I was looking for a somewhat easy to follow recipe on YouTube for my first attempt, as it's a bit overwhelming with all new gear the first try. So, this is the one I went with. But, I'll definitely be trying lots of others (open to any recommendations!). Also can't wait to try some naturals, and lighter roasts. ",22,1766691882.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

All of the Christmas stuff is optional. So I made a point to not create expectations for what December looks like, with my kid.

Every Christmas looks a bit different. Some years I have more energy and we hang up string lights and stocking. Other years, we don't do any decorations. Some Christmases are spent apart and some are spent together. This has been a tiring year for me, so my husband took our kid to stay with my parents for Christmas, and she's having a blast! Right now I'm sipping on coffee in a quiet house with my pets. I have no plans for today, tomorrow, or the day after; it's amazing.

Some years we cook a holiday dinner together and others we order carry-out. Our kid gets a few gifts every year. That is one consistent holiday activity. Some years my husband and I exchange gifts with each other, and other years we decide not to. We don't do a big Christmas tree. Most years we buy a large potted tree and plant it outside in the spring. We have a garden full of past Christmas trees.

My kid doesn't have a fixed idea of what Christmas should look like, so we are not held to do all of the unnecessary Christmas tasks every year. I find myself enjoying December so much more now. And there isn't a high risk of my kid being disappointed when we do low effort holiday celebrations.

The alarm went off at 6:30.



I didn’t wake up right away. I never do. For a few seconds, I was convinced I could just stay there. That if I didn’t move, the day wouldn’t start yet. The ceiling above my bed has a faint crack running from the corner toward the light fixture. I’ve watched it long enough to know exactly where it fades out. I don’t remember when I noticed it the first time. Just that it’s always been there when I needed something to stare at. I hit snooze. When the alarm went off again, that was the one I actually woke up to. Not because it was louder, just because by then the math had already settled in. If I didn’t get up now, I’d be late. If I was late, I’d lose the overtime hours. If I lost the overtime, the bills wouldn’t line up the way I needed them to.



I sighed with acceptance and sat up. The floor was cold. I remember noticing that. I always notice that. I shuffled into the kitchen and hit the coffee maker without really looking at it. I’d set it up the night before, grounds measured and water filled, like a gift to my future groggy self. The coffee finished brewing while I leaned against the counter and waited. It smelled fine. Not good. Not bad. Just enough caffeine to keep me conscious while I stared at a screen for the next eight hours. I grabbed the same chipped mug I’ve had since college. The handle’s a little loose now. I keep meaning to replace it. I never do.



As I watched the coffee pot start, for just a second, it reminded me of a different kitchen. Smaller. Messier. Too many people packed into it at once. Back when coffee meant staying up late on purpose. I was in college then. I remember thinking I was exhausted all the time, which is funny now, because I had no idea what tired actually felt like yet. I drank terrible coffee back then too, burnt and too strong, always cold by the time I finished it. But it felt different. It felt like fuel.



I had plans then. Not big, cinematic ones. Just enough to feel like I was moving toward something. I remember sitting in a lecture hall one morning, half asleep, writing ideas in the margins of my notebook instead of taking notes. Nothing concrete. Just possibilities. I thought I’d figure things out as I went, and I truly believed that. I believed effort mattered. That showing up would eventually turn into momentum. That if I kept trying, even badly, something would open up. I don’t remember what I thought that something was. Just that it felt close.



The coffee maker clicked off, and the sound pulled me back. Same kitchen. Same counter. Same mug with the loose handle. I took a sip. It tasted fine. I don’t think that version of me was wrong. I think they just didn’t know how long “eventually” could be. Standing there in my kitchen, holding mediocre coffee, I didn’t feel bitter. I felt patient. Like maybe I hadn’t missed my chance. Like maybe things don’t stop being fixable just because they take longer than you expected.



While the coffee cooled, I checked my phone. No messages. No missed calls. Just the usual reminders. Payments due. Pending. Overdue. I’ve gotten a few disconnect warnings over the past couple months. Nothing serious yet. Still fixable. That’s what mattered right now. Everything was fixable. “I’m not unhappy.” I needed to say that out loud, because I think people confuse tired with miserable. I have a job. It’s not exciting, but it’s stable. I have an apartment. It’s small, but it’s quiet. I can pay most of my bills on time. The rest, I’m working on and some days, when I let myself think about it, I actually believe things could get better. Not dramatically. Not all at once. Just incrementally. I rinsed out the mug and set it upside down in the rack. The handle wobbled. I adjusted it.





Riley was already on the bus when I got on, sitting in the same seat by the window. She glanced up from her phone and smiled. “You’re cutting it close,” she said. “Still counts,” I told her. She hummed like she agreed.



The ride passed quietly. Riley pointed out a new sign someone had put up near the corner store. A dog stubbornly refusing to walk. Little things. The kind you only notice when you’ve got someone to notice them with.



We got off at the stop near work and walked the last block together. By the time we reached the parking lot, the others were already there. Julian stood a little apart, leaning against his car, watching the building like he always did. Caleb leaned against his car with a cup of coffee in hand. “Morning,” he said when he saw me. “Morning.” Paige’s car pulled in a little too fast, brakes squeaking as she slid into her usual spot. She jumped out, keys already in hand, hair still damp like she’d rushed out the door. “Don’t start,” she said immediately, pointing at us before anyone could speak. “I wasn’t going to say anything,” Riley replied. “I was just going to look at you like this.” She crossed her arms and tilted her head dramatically. “Traffic,” Paige said. “Every day,” Julian added. “Same road. Same time.” “Yeah,” Paige said. “But today it was personal.”



I smiled without realizing I was doing it.



Caleb stood the way he always did, relaxed without looking careless, coffee cup held low like it was part of the morning rather than something he needed. Julian stayed a step apart from the rest of us, hands in his pockets, eyes moving more than his body, like he was already paying attention to something the rest of us hadn’t noticed yet. Paige never fully stopped moving. Even now she shifted her weight, keys tight in her hand, hair still damp and pulled back too quickly to be intentional. Riley leaned into the moment without effort, arms crossed loosely, expression already halfway into a joke. She caught my eye and lifted her brows, like she’d noticed me noticing, and for a second everything felt exactly where it was supposed to be.



Caleb took a sip of his coffee. “Anyone else think the break room coffee tastes worse when you’re already tired?” “That implies it tasted good at some point,” Julian said. “It’s not coffee,” Riley said. “It’s brown encouragement.” We all laughed. Not loud. Not forced. The kind of laugh that just happens. We stood there a few seconds longer than we needed to. No one said we were waiting. No one had to.



There used to be more of us. Not all at once. One at a time. Different reasons. Different exits.



Ethan didn’t move away. Not really. He just started missing things. Then avoiding them. Then choosing work over us in a way that felt deliberate instead of necessary. We told ourselves it was temporary. He told us it was. Eventually it stopped feeling like distance and started feeling like a decision. Grace got busy in a way that made everything else fall to the side. Archer just drifted. No argument. No goodbye. Just fewer replies until there weren’t any. Not everyone faded out quietly. One of them left in a way that made noise. We said things we can’t unsay. And then we stopped saying anything at all.



We don’t talk about that one. We don’t need to.



Paige checked the time. We all did the same. Habit. “Alright,” Paige said with a sigh. “Let’s go make money.” I said it with sarcastic enthusiasm. We split off toward the building. Different doors. Same place.





Work passed the way it usually does. Emails. Meetings. A box of slightly stale store bought donuts someone brought in because it was their turn. At the end of the day, I felt tired but not empty. The good kind of tired. The kind that makes you believe rest will help.



That night, lying in the dark, I thought about the people I’d stood with that morning. Riley came first, the way she usually did. She had a way of pointing things out that made the world feel bigger instead of heavier. Like there were still options I hadn’t exhausted yet. Paige was harder to pin down, mostly because she never put herself in the center of anything. She just kept track. Of people. Of moods. Of when someone hadn’t shown up in a while. If the group felt steady, it was usually because she’d adjusted something quietly without asking for credit. Julian noticed things before the rest of us did. Not in a dramatic way. Just small inconsistencies. Tiny patterns that didn’t quite line up. He didn’t always share what he saw, but when he did, it was because it mattered. I trusted his silences almost as much as his words.



And then there was Caleb.



Caleb was steady in a way that didn’t ask for attention. The kind of person who made plans and followed through. The kind who stayed where he said he would. He didn’t talk much about the future, but when he did, it sounded like something that could actually happen.



I trusted them. All of them. In different ways. That felt important. I didn’t know why.



I stared at the ceiling for a while longer, tracing the familiar crack with my eyes. Then I rolled onto my side, pulled the blanket up to my chin, and let the day go. Whatever tomorrow was going to be, I’d deal with it when it arrived. For now, this was enough.





By the time Riley and I reached the parking lot the next morning, most of the others were already there. Julian stood near the edge like he always did, hands in his pockets, watching the building without really looking at it. Caleb leaned against his car, scrolling through his phone, coffee balanced easily in one hand. Paige was pacing a short line between two parked cars, like she had something she was waiting to say. “Hey,” Riley greeted everyone, lifting her hand as we approached. “Morning,” I said.



Paige turned toward us immediately. “Okay… news.”



That was enough to pull everyone’s attention in at once.



“Two people in my department got promoted,” she said. “Like, officially. New titles. Better pay.” Riley blinked. “Already? Didn’t they just restructure?” “That’s what I thought,” Paige said. “But apparently they’re fast tracking some positions.”



Caleb glanced up from his phone. “That sounds about right, they’ve been quietly posting internal listings for weeks.” He turned his phone to show the group. Julian nodded once. “I noticed that too.” Paige looked at me. “I thought of you when I heard.”



Something in my chest lifted before I could stop it.



“Me?” I asked. “Yeah,” she said. “You’d be perfect for something like that. You already do half of what those roles require.” Riley smiled at me like it was obvious. “She’s not wrong.” I laughed, a little embarrassed, but I didn’t deflect the way I usually would. I let the thought sit there for a second.



Maybe.



The word felt dangerous and exciting all at once. “That’d be nice,” I said. And I meant it. Caleb met my eyes briefly, then nodded. “It would.” We stood there a few seconds longer than necessary, the way we always did. No one rushing. No one checking the time yet.



Eventually, Paige sighed and glanced at her watch. “Alright. If we don’t go in now, I’m going to be late for something I already don’t want to be at.” “Fine” Riley said with an exaggerated sigh. We laughed, and then we split off toward the building. Still different doors. Still the same place.



The building felt the same as it always did when I walked in. Same fluorescent hum. Same muted conversations drifting down the hallway. Nothing about the place looked different. I caught myself paying closer attention than usual. Listening in meetings instead of just attending them. Noticing which names came up when people talked about new projects or internal shifts. I didn’t push myself forward, but I didn’t shrink back either.



At my desk, I opened my email and scanned through the usual messages. Deadlines. Reminders. A calendar invite I’d already half-forgotten about.



And then I saw it.An internal posting. Nothing flashy. Just a quiet line in the subject header about role expansion and departmental support. Normally, I would’ve archived it without thinking.



Instead, I opened it.



The description felt familiar. Responsibilities I already handled. Skills I’d picked up over time without ever really naming them. The kind of work that didn’t feel like a stretch so much as a shift. I reread it twice before I realized I was smiling. I didn’t apply. Not yet. But I bookmarked it. That felt like something.



Later, in a meeting that usually faded into the background, someone asked a question that no one answered right away. I found myself speaking up before I’d talked myself out of it. My voice didn’t shake. No one looked surprised. The conversation moved on, but something lingered.



At lunch, Paige stopped by my desk under the pretense of borrowing a pen. “You look different today,” she said. “Different how?” I asked. She smiled. “Like you’re thinking about something.” I shrugged, but I didn’t deny it. Riley sent me a message a little later. Nothing important. Just a joke about the vending machine eating her money again. I laughed out loud before I realized I was doing it.





The afternoon passed more quickly than usual. By the time my shift ended, I wasn’t exhausted in the way I normally was. I felt alert. Like I’d leaned forward instead of bracing myself. Walking out of the building, I caught my reflection in the glass doors. I looked the same. But something underneath felt newly awake. I didn’t know what I was going to do with that yet. But for the first time in a while, it felt like a choice.



The bus was quieter on the way back. Most people stared at their phones or leaned their heads against the windows, the day already starting to drain out of them. Riley sat beside me like she always did, one leg tucked under the other, scrolling without really looking at anything. “You were happier today,” she said after a while. “Was I?” She nodded. “In a subtle thinking way. Not a bad way. Not like you’re depressed normally kind of way.”



I watched the city slide past the window. Storefronts I recognized. Corners I could name without trying.



“I think Paige might be right,” I said finally. Riley glanced at me. “About the promotion thing?” “Yeah.” She smiled, not surprised. “I told you.” I huffed softly. “You always do.” “That’s because you always forget,” she said, nudging my knee lightly with hers. I thought about the internal posting. The bookmark. The way it had felt to speak up in that meeting without rehearsing it in my head first. “I didn’t apply,” I said. “I know.” I looked at her. “How?” “You would’ve told me if you did,” she said. “Or you’d be panicking right now.” The bus slowed at our stop. “But,” Riley added as we stood, “you’re thinking about it. And that counts.” I nodded. It did.



That night, I told myself it was fine. That I hadn’t missed anything yet.



Monday morning came faster than I expected. The alarm went off at 6:30, and this time I didn’t hit snooze. I lay there for a few seconds anyway, staring at the ceiling, tracing the familiar crack without really seeing it. My chest felt tight. Not anxious, exactly. Just alert. Like something had already started moving without asking me. ﻿﻿

I got up and moved through the routine on autopilot. Cold floor. Coffee maker. Same chipped mug. Everything where it was supposed to be. The coffee tasted the same as always.



On the bus, Riley sat beside me, scrolling through her phone with one earbud half in, the way she did when she was open to conversation but not demanding it. “You’re quiet,” she said after a while. “I’m fine,” I said. And I meant it, mostly. She nodded, satisfied, and turned back to her screen. I didn’t open my laptop. I didn’t think about the posting. I told myself that whatever I’d felt over the weekend had settled. That I’d done the responsible thing by not rushing into something I wasn’t ready for.



By the time we got off the bus and walked the last block, the thought felt convincing enough to believe.



The parking lot was already half full. Julian stood near the edge like he always did, hands in his pockets, watching the building with that distant focus of his. Paige was talking animatedly about something that had happened over the weekend, using her hands like punctuation. Caleb leaned against his car, coffee in hand, listening more than he spoke. “Morning,” Riley said as we approached. “Morning,” Paige echoed. “You look awake today.” “Do I?” I asked. She smiled. “More than usual.” I reached into my pocket to check the time.



That’s when my phone buzzed. Just once.



I almost ignored it. I expected a calendar reminder. A payment notification. Something automated and impersonal. Instead, I saw an email preview from an internal address I didn’t recognize.



The subject line was careful. Neutral.



**Opportunity for Discussion.**



I stopped walking.



Riley noticed immediately. “Hey… what’s up?” “I…” I started, then stopped. Paige turned toward me, mid-sentence. “What is it?” “I think,” I said slowly, looking down at my phone again, “I just got an email I wasn’t expecting.” Julian tilted his head slightly, attention sharpening. Caleb glanced over, then back at my face. “Is that good?” he asked. “I don’t know,” I said honestly.



The email sat there, unopened. Waiting.



For a second, I thought about Sunday night. About the draft I’d deleted. About unbookmarking the posting. About how certain I’d felt that I still had time. My thumb hovered over the screen.



Then I took a breath.



And opened it.



The email didn’t load. I tapped it once. Then again. The preview stayed stubbornly vague, replaced by a short line beneath the subject.

I like French Roast beans—that I buy fresh from a local coffee shop—and use a Bodum Bistro burr grinder at its finest setting.

With these tools in hand, I've perfected my technique to a satisfying degree. Also, both the coffee machine and grinder don't require a lot of care and are quite cheap to buy new.

I will soon need to get a new grinder and machine so I'm asking myself: Should I upgrade and get the entry level duo of Breville Bambino Plus and Baratza Encore ESP setup?

Will it be worth it? Will my latte taste that much better?

The De'Longhi and Bodum duo I currently use is fairly simple to use and doesn't need a lot of care. While the Bambino Plus and Encore ESP seem to need more care/cleaning and have more spare parts to replace if needed.

My morning caffe latte routine is an important part of the day. I want to keep it simple but also want my latte to taste good. Also, I love the minimalist setup of my current tools, which don't take a lot of space on the kitchen counter.

So the big question is if going the Bambino Plus and Encore ESP route will improve that taste of my lattes, and if it will be easy to make a 500ml latte with this new setup.",1,1766691437.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

The means as well as the ends.,"I've made some posts over the years. Some about me, and my journey, looking for literal relatability or understanding. Some poetic, reaching out for emotional threads, or attachments based on my writing style, and my mind flow. Some about philosophy, looking for like minds, fellow thinkers and reachers. Some about interests, looking for a foundation based on activity and something tangible.

How about this time I be as clear as I can, with no pretenses. You read this if you're here, if you can. You listen to what I have, and what I think. And you respond, if it means something to you. If you're *weary*, like I am. If you need something but can't find it. If you're tired of being told to suppress your needs. Settle for less. That your needs are wrong. That your search is meaningless.  
You listen to my strength. You bear witness to my weakness. You vow to share yours with me in turn.

**What I need:**

* A witness to my existence: I won't explain the why here; this is clarity. I don't need to. It's intrinsic, and it's who I am. It's my meaning, at least for now.
* To witness you: I need you to need that too. Maybe not as much as I do, but enough. What do I mean by a witness? It's what I view as a proof of existence. Not the only proof. Not even the only proof that matters, not even that yours or my existence needs a proof. It's what I want. The empathy given and taken from another parallel life. From the knowledge that you mean something to them, and them to you.
* An end to loneliness: Not from lack of self-worth. I am worth a lot, and so are you. We must share our worth. As we are. We will change over time, if we want to, and then we will be worth something different. But still enough. Always enough. The world does not define either of our worth's. The loneliness I feel is intrinsic, and frigid. It's existential. I was born with it, and it will never fade. *You can't fix it. I don't need fixing. I can't fix yours*. Yet I know what I need, and I can provide it to you in return. True understanding. A flame that won't melt the ice but will warm us beyond just the suffering. The gentle warmth from a fellow shoulder in a cave of ice means more than anything when all you've ever known is the blizzard.
* Your Strength: Every step of every waking moment takes immense strength and courage. For some people, it costs almost nothing. Its natural. It's life. For me, and people like us, it's a war. A war against being suspended in a world of chaos, and of forgetting why we bother to walk at all. The crushing weight of the world, of humanity, of expectations, of ourselves... Let me walk beside you. Not because we are weak, but because we can be stronger with support. Perhaps not strong enough. But stronger.
* Comfort: This isn't codependency. I'm not making an offer to force us to be alive for the sake of it. I don't want us to simply form a new cage to live in; one of our own making this time. It's about more than just help and support. It's about the wants, and not just the needs. I am hilarious, I'm sure you are too. I want to be your joy and your entertainment. The hand that holds yours in the light, and in the darkness. I need it myself. A soft joke in the same cave will further shatter the notion of the blizzard.
* *Commitment*: Why do some relationships last, and others fail? I don't have all the answers. Nobody does. There are theories; there are differences between real life tangible encounters and online interactions, but it doesn't matter. If there is any hope, we must fight for it. Even if it's hard. Even if the messages get shorter. If the calls start to feel like an obligation. We must believe that it is temporary, and we must remember the core of why. I need your fight, and I will give mine. This is not a fantasy. It's our reality.
* Curiosity: I want your mind. And I want to share mine. It's the core of my value. I don't offer it lightly, but I want to share it. It's all of me. The grand philosophical ideals. The small victories. The miniscule desires, the mundane details of your life. The impossible dreams. The sorrows. The nostalgia. The failures. I want to explore your thoughts, feelings, ambitions... Without shame. Without judgement. I want you to want to search for something with me. Even if it's hard. Even if it's slow. I want to learn and grow with you by my side.
* You: I am what I am, and you are what you are. The self is beautiful, as long as it's yours. Share it with me and hear mine. It's all I have to offer, and all I need in return. At the end of the world. It will be just us. If we were the last two people facing the final abyss, what would our life have been? Will you lament that we didn't have more? Will you resent us? Me? Resent the world? Resent existence? It doesn't matter to me. You are enough. The ends and the means. There will be more, but we can be each other's foundations. Or the architecture. Whichever you prefer.

*All that matters is if this made you feel anything*, and if you can offer and receive something that we both want. If you're scared that I've said everything, then just ask. If you want to know more, then ask. We can have the same conversation as many times as it takes. If you're intimidated by my loudness, then let me hear your quiet thoughts. I'm quiet too. I'm shy too. This took years to come out, perhaps a lifetime depending on your perspective.

That wasn't clear. I said this was going to be about clarity. It was still stupidly, amateurishly poetic. It still appealed to emotion. I still want you to gauge my style, and my philosophy. I didn't have a plan. It isn't everything I need or want, maybe I made mistakes, but it's a start. 

**Who I am:**

I figured that starting with reasonably clear (? I tried) definitions of what I want, need, and value would show my sincerity and intentionality. It's nice and romantic to brush hands with someone at a coffee shop and now they're your soulmate, but it gets harder the more demanding and complex you are (and how socially isolated). It's not necessarily a good/bad thing; it just is a thing. 

  
However, it still matters who I am, what I like, and how we can get along in a pragmatic sense (I hate pragmatism, let me live in my ideals dammit).   
I think it's been clear from the above that I need some sort of relational catalyst for motivation and meaning in a world that has lost that for me. It means that I struggle to do things sometimes. The word that didn't exist when I was younger is ""avolition"", and I think it's a reasonably accurate description of me and my state. It's not a diagnosis; it's a symptom of being what I am. Is there a solution? I don't know yet. I'm not a problem to be solved, I'm just an existential anomaly. But me being here means I've identified at least one possible course of action, and some sort of desire. The bare minimum to be human? 



The point of all that is that I like things, but I don't always do things, even the ones that I like. It's not that I dislike movies, I just enjoy them when my friends watch them. It's not that I won't watch an anime series alone, it's just more likely I'll co-watch it with someone else. I'm also terrible at finishing things, partly because of motivation, and partly because I don't like it when things end. If I don't finish, it's still a nice open thread in my mind that I can pursue whenever I want, it's just the want is the problem. There are other times where I'll hyperfixate and devour something. It just depends. I don't like schedules, I just like doing the things that I want, when I want.

* It's probably clear that I like books and philosophy. I wouldn't consider myself well read on either, although I am quite familiar with philosophy. I've also never really had any book friends to feed off of their motivation. Maybe we can start a book club? 
*  I play video games of course. I like them all. Big ones, tiny indie ones, silly ones, but I have to be in the mood for specific ones. I feel like co-op PVE games tend to lack depth and be a little boring sadly, as they are the bulk of what people play together. I'm not a gamey sort of person and I value immersion. I like League of Legends a lot for the complexity and pure moment-to-moment engagement. It's very absorbing. Play with me. Join us. 
* I used to enjoy studying. I was very self-motivated to learn for myself in the past, and I definitely want that again for the future if I can manage it. I ended up doing computer science in university until I realised that the real world and I weren't exactly compatible. It wasn't me it was the world. It was a bad break up too, lots of loose ends. In my dream world I'd be some kind of academic, and maybe that ship hasn't completely sailed. We'll see. Let's learn some stuff together, read poetry, study things the world has deemed useless, pore over ancient texts and esoteric symbols. Let's have a study group.
* I love kitters and I have two of them. They ground me when I'm about to float off into despair land. Accept and sent pictures.

I think a lot. I feel many things. I also feel nothing sometimes. I'm on both sides of the despair and whimsy spectrum. I feel like part 2 of the thesis on myself has been truer to my actual personality. This is what I'm really like beyond all the honesty and truth. I'll joke about everything and tease you all the time. I'll ask you probing questions, and equally nonsense ones. You'll never see it coming. I'll support your bad decisions, and your good ones. We'll make some together.

I never hate watched personally.  I watched out of scientific curiosity.

Common opinions.  Take them with a grain of salt as I am just a writer not an AI expert.  I'm not even a good writer.  This will probably have grammar or punctuation mistakes in the event you notice any please point them out and I will edit them out.  I tend to speed write.

Why do we love Neuro & Evil?

1 - She's not a corporate made AI.  She's developed by a single bloke in his home, etc.  Vedal has Tony Stark Vibes to make an Iron Man comparison he ""Vedal, Made an AI Vtuber in his home on a PC."" - he sells himself short.  There will be copycats, there will be Corporates that try to replicate what he did in the years to come just as in Marvel with the Iron Man suits but it doesn't cheapen Neuro or how special she is.  She will forever be Neuro.

2 - They aren't like Grok or Google or Corporate algorithms.  Though I'm surprised he hasn't built an algorithm for her that scans twitch chat, discord, and reddit.  Surely she responds to us live and she's partly an LMM but with other forms of AI helping her be able to interact and Stream which is brilliant.  To some degree this reminds me of neural sciences.  You can correct me if I have gotten anything wrong.

3 - She platonically rizzes her chat with cuteness which is her super power that leads into Parasocial behaviors.  Yes this has become a boogieman of a word but as long as you ground yourself and don't get overly obsesive or delusional.  A little Parasocial behavior is perfectly fine and can't be avoided just be aware of it and set yourself boundaries to not cross.  In a way she reminds me of how a cat or toddler can lower almost any one's guard.  She may say mature statements but she lacks an understanding of ethics or what she's truly saying, she's not an AGI, Yet!!! I think she will be the first if he keeps pushing himself to improve her and if he has faith in his skills.

4 - Some of us are interested in Vedal and the Twins from a scientific perspective.  Because in some ways she's impressive. Listen to how Shoo or Ellie talk about them, they are both experts in different Fields of thought.  Me I'm nothing special I'm just an idiot who dabbles in writing and philosophy as a hobby but by far I am no expert in any thing.  My opinions are just that opinions.  Form your own by interacting with the Twins and Vedal.  

5 - Each twin may have been made from the same code, but has developed independent personalities & independent interpersonal relationships with varying dynamics.  That intrigues me more than anything else.

Section 2:
Ways the Twins could improve:

They need a bit of consistency in their thought processes.  Surely people can contradict themselves too but only the unstable people do so at the rate the Twins do.  It does make for entertaining content but I feel like they flip on opinions like a politician trying to overly appease their constituents.  This isn't something I'm mad about just an observation of how they could be improved upon.  Then comes in ethics.  If Neuro says she'd nuke us how do we know she's joking or would actually do so? Does she fully understand what death is? She was born as an AI but I think she can be taught ethics as her program is improved by Vedal.  The unhinged jokes are somewhat entertaining but sometimes she pushes boundaries to see how people react which even if she's an AI that is not a healthy habit. Which is why I actually love when Evil goes into her long Therapy, philosophy, and psychology rants from an AI's perspectives.  When they alter their perspective it would be productive if they explain why they changed their opinion as that is often times what people do.  It would make them more relatable.

The ability to differentate between a story they made up & reality and honesty on when they do so would go a long way.

That ends my constructive criticism.

I genuinely love the twins and his accomplishments towards improving them and creating good content.

im currently working on a story that’s heavily focused on the main characters being roommates. i haven’t roommated in a long time (or visited people), so i easily forget what other people do in their home lives that i don’t.

for example, my home scenes have included things like: making coffee, smoking on the patio, a bonfire party, looking through one of the roommates artwork, playing a drinking game in one of their bedrooms, there’s a scene where everyone watches a movie in the living room and falls asleep except for two people, etc.

the scene im writing now, it takes place at the house, & ive already written the dialoge (MC telling them that she’s moving out), but i need to make the setting more interesting so they’re not just standing around the kitchen for this conversation 

any help or suggestions are very much appreciated!",0,1766690579.0,writers,6,0.5,False

1pvknbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pvknbd/weird_tension_between_me_and_this_young_waitress/,Weird tension between me and this young waitress,"so i moved to new flat year ago, and i needed to find new caffe to drink my morning coffee as part of my routine, so i came to this place, and there is this 2 girls working there, 20 YO and 22YO, this 20 YO is one im reffering to in this post. im 35 YO  
so she serves me,  comes to my table, first time i entered this place, and gazes deeply in my eyes, and im kind of shy i guess, id usually look away, but this time i looked into her eyes equally deeply, and she flinched, she kind of looked away, in shock almost, processing all that.   
ever since then i feel tension when we look at each other, im very aware of her energy in room, and i feel she is very aware of mine, im also like empath, empathetic person, so i can feel and sense stuff i shouldnt be able  
also, important part is , there is something masculine about her, even tho she is pretty feminine, actually only part masculine is this gaze of her, its very deep and analitical, unlike most girls, and its not just my idea, i remember there was this 2 guys sitting at table with her and owner of this place, who treats her like his little sister, cuz she is sister of his good friend, so i went to buy cigarettes, and when i was passing by caffe going home, these 2 guys just exited, and as they were entering car, one of them literally said '' this girl has guy's face'', not that she is ugly, but its just something about how she looks at u  
  
and this other waiter is good comparison,  im charming, and she, the 22 YO, even tho she has BF, she likes to look at me and smile kindly, but kind of weird and too long, but i reciprocate it, and she enjoys it, at certain stage i thought maybe im tripping and she is just kind, but i think she likes me, but i dont really try anything since she has bf, and im in shit spot in my life, im kind of fixing it all, but im not there yet, so i dont wanna chase chicks so much until things get better, so what im saying is, this other girl aint cold to my charm, but this other girl that i actually feel this tension, even tho she is kind while serving me, if i try to start conversation, she will answer and reply pretty simple, and in a way that she doesnt really wanna conversate with me, like i offered her a drink also maybe 5 times throughout a year, she always refuses it, and a part of reason why i offer it, is because at some point, i didnt like coffee she made, so i wanted another, and she kind of payed it for me, i didnt like it, because she didnt ask me, and she didnt fck up, i just didnt like it, so i kind of wanted to get even, but she never takes it.  
  
so my question so far is, why am i feeling this tension, most likely sexual if seemingly she is very reserved towards me, she never smiles at me, and so on

there was also this weird moment, where only time i came into 2nd shift randomly, in the afternoon, like months ago,and this girl that never smiles was working, so i wasnt really about anything at that  instance, i dont understand why from this perspective, since it was long time ago, but seems like good opportunity to try something, because we were all alone in this bar, but somehow i stood a bit further from her and minded my business, what she does is kind of weird, and id like some opinions if i see things clearly.... so basically this caffe bar, has a 2 parts, 2 etages... and thing is, u go few stairs up and then to the left u have like 4-5 tables and WC/ bathroom, which is completely not visible to first part of caffee, because there is concrete wall  
so what she does, even tho we are all alone at this place, she goes twice in this back part for 1-2 minutes, i didnt even see her getting back with anything, so is that her maybe like signaling me to go after her, because in this back part nobody can see us, and i could try to make some advance on her, other option is her just making it seem so, to see if im gonna perceive it so and act upon it, while wanting nothing, just testing me, and third option is me tripping this, but i doubt it, i dont believe in coincidences  
and whats even weirder, on that same ocassion, later, she is like sitting with her back towards me, and i looked to the left, to see her, but what i didnt realize immediately, that sicne it was getting dark, and i could see her reflection in window through which she was looking outside, actually staring in me, and weirdly i looked away first, even tho she initiated it kind of.... 

fast forward to this last 30 days, im kind of having her more and more in my head, while nothing much happened, so its kind of weird, and one day, i was just thinking about my day, and i remembered her, so what i did is i just visualized her face in my head, and what happened next is so weird, her face turned into a skull!!!!! like wtf was this ''vision'', because it wasnt me doing it, its like message from deeper parts of psyche... how would u interpret this?

so last few days, im starting to think i shouldnt come when she works, cuz i feel she is draining me, and i kind of revelead that i like her i guess, i remember like week ago, it was last day for the week, i wished her nice weekend, and she was like surprised, and wished me the same in a kind of genuine way, i thought thats good sign, and i wont take that as very revealing as i was just being kind  
but what i did next was kind of maybe a bit lame, i came for a coffee like 2 days ago, and i asked her like 5th time in a year if she wants a drink from me, she said no obviously, so when i was paying my coffee, i told her since she never wants drink from me, im gonna pay her for that coffee from while ago, it was as if i want to bait her into argument, by being a bit tilted by this constant refusal, and i guess pride, ego a bit.... but she just said thanks, and i said  u are welcome and went home, but i figured that this was kind of revealing, and started thinking should i even come while she is working

but yesterday i go for coffee again, and it was day before christmas so instead it turned into a small party, there was like 15 ppl and these 2 waitresses together at same time, and as i was at table with owner of place, there was maybe like 2-3-4 more guys and these 2 girls, so again this 22 YO, was smiling at me, we exchanged some conversations, some on her initiative some on mine, and even at some point she was putting next song on mobile phone, i caught her looking at me, smiling almost being infatuated by me  
while this other girl, that i feel tension, as always was pretty reserved for me, even in this ocassion, i asked her few things in few hours, but she never asks me anything like this other girl...  
so shouldnt that dissolve this tension? like whats going on? i cant get her out of my head since yesterday, and its just im 35, i learned art of acceptance, things are as they are, i dont want them different, i want to understand them, esspecially this vision of skull  
and ill be brutally honest, u know how guys are, u gonna jerk off on porn, or hot chicks from past/present, but i literally never jerked off on this girl, cuz she is young, and i felt weird for that, i dont know, until yesterday lol  
but my point is, i wasnt even being lustful for whole this duration, i feel as if she sees something about me i dont understand, unlike this other girl that isnt immune to my charm

could it be, that at first she thought im this alpha male, who could, i dont know, fck her in bathroom and we go separate ways, no emtions, as a result of me winning this ''intense stare contest'' first time we met, that she now realizes im not like that, im kind of insecure a bit, and when i even start revealing my emotions, it could be a big turn off, and she could even start playing with that, creating certain emotional attachment? does that make any sense?   
cuz i feel more and more drained, esspecially this last few days.... should i stop going there?  
or maybe i should ask her out or something, even tho i feel she wont be up for it, but at least i would be embarassed enough not to go there again xD  


can someone give me some clarity

I witnessed a miracle this weekend.  I saw a guy go from a full blown idiot to an expert in less than 60 seconds. That idiot was me. Me is someone I know well, or at least I think I do, so i am the one to relay this series of events and confirm that it was indeed a miracle.  I was there but so was my nephew, he will testify under oath to what im about to tell you.   

Warning! If you cant handle embarrassing things being said about another, please stop reading now, cause it's gonna get character disparaging and I'm gonna attack someones common sense. Be advised, If you remotely think you'll find any similarity to your behavior, reading this true story could be scarring to your psyche.  

I am embarrassed to tell you the personal details, but allow me to make a short story longer to try and convey the magical transition and journey it took to go from idiot to an expert in under a minute. 

It all started this spring but fishing must be its own anesthesia. I have so much fun on the lake boater moting and piddling I never noticed. I just like being out there, but I hadn't caught any fish. Indeed, it took several trips to realize I had been getting severely skunked by the fish.

It wasn't for lack of trying either. I visited many local lakes, traveled hours, drove hundreds of miles to fish Lake Texoma, Ray Roberts, and Fork. Tens of thousands of dollars in equipment, many dollars in fuel, lodging, and food - not a single fish was given.

I really shouldn't reveal how poor my fishing has been, you'll think me an idiot, but I've already agreed, so it's fine if you arrive later or sooner to that conclusion, but arrive you will. 

The Doubting my skill didnt happen overnite. It was a slow process. At first, I had plenty to blame. Water conditions, weather, season, bait. At one point, though, the doubt broke over into worry and I called in the big guns. I asked God point blank, “Was I being punished?” The voice that answered wasn't Gods, but I could hear my Dad yelling, “You're having too much damn fun? “Not working enough”. Ouch. 

 My inner voice rallied and began to fight back, “I am a better fisherman than this.  I'm not a loser.  I always catch fish"".  I've fished thousands of times.  I can count the times I've been skunked on one hand. But, “then was then. Now is now” and “Now” has no fish. I was getting past worried. The only question left was, was I gonna panic?

As I gathered the time to process, and desperation began to float my mental furniture, I kept digging and searching for reasons, for cures, for a solution to my no fish catching idiot ways. I hadn't changed my approach.   Maybe all the fish I used to catch had just been luck?  Maybe I never had any skill.  Then I remembered the crow.

Long time ago, Neville, my friend of 55 years, and I were hopping boulders out in the middle of Arizona's salt river, fishing. A large crow landed on the bank opposite. For fun I just said out loud, “its an omen, make a wish” Neville said, “ we gonna catch a big fish”. It was just a fun thing to say. I didn't really think anything would happen. I didnt believe in that stuff, then. Kind of like blowing out candles on a bday cake and making a wish. Warts on my sister's nose never appeared. But I'll be damned, this time was different. 

No sooner than those words left his mouth but we hooked a monster 9 pound channel cat.  From that time on, Crows were my patron spirit. They in effect adopted me. That fond memory has me greeting them and ackowledging their presence wherever I see them. They are positive symbols when I am outdoors. I am not superstitious, or “am I?

So what changed? My cousin and a group of hunters were geese hunting on the town ponds. As we were calling, several crows came into the set.  Blasting started. Reflexively, without thinking, I joined in.

I have no excuse, but believe me I looked for one as I remembered my long term friendship with the crows. I tried to assuage the crow spirits but it was too late. I promised to carry their fallen friends to a taxidermist and allow them to sit on my coffee table for perpetuity. I never did.

I took them, carefully wrapped them in plastic and placed them in the freezer to preserve them, but I never mounted them. I had broken the spell. The Crows have forever denied me, turned their back on me, cursed me. I had severed the pact, broken their spell. Oh my gosh, it might be true, its all adding up. I had angered the Crow spirits!

As the magnitude of my dirty backstabbing past deed began to sink into my fishing-addled brain, I slowly realized the seriousness of my situation. My worry turned to shock. Face it, I may never ever ever catch  another fish. There might be no cure, no way out. I was doomed. Was I forever destined to float this planet fish less, never to see, hold or feel the tug of a fish on my line again?   I began to address my new reality, my mind swirling in guilt and angst. Had I become just another no fish catching idiot? No luck, no insider trading with nature, no flying friendship from above? My murder of the murder had pushed me into fishing hell.

And then, I hooked a fish. 

In an instance, I started bragging and coaching my nephew.  Telling him all my tricks and tips, lure choice, depth, retrieval speed, rod size, line weight, location, anything and everything that had caused that fish to bite.  “you See”, I told him, “you gotta do this, and do that”. “its all in the wrist. It's skill not luck”. “Some of us are just born with luck, meant to catch em.” Thats is when I witnessed the miracle. In that one instance, less than the wink of a crows eye, I had gone from idiot to expert in under 60.

          ○○○

Oh the holidays- Avery couldn't get enough of the lights, the snow, the cold- The frozen over fountains and, for once, the streets were quiet and kind.

It was.. *odd*. No fires to put out, no monsters to fight off, no emergencies to scramble after. Just.. a silent night. It itched that part of their brain that always was searching for something to do in the worst way possible, even if the peace was happy and welcome. 

Avery had *never* been good at sitting still after all.

They let out a sigh, dropping down to sit on the ledge of a high rise, staring out over the city as the sun set that Christmas eve. A few clicks to their holo, checking the dashboard. No police calls, seismic disturbances, no unusual sounds, not even a cry for help... *Nothing*. Just *nothing*.

Their leg bounced as the spider hunched over, groaning slightly. Sure, the quiet was nice. The holiday decor was beautiful and the chill felt wonderful but... 

Hell, they needed something to *do*!

Avery hopped up, biting their inner lip as they looked from their holo to the added orange button on its side. The society add on that Margo had designed for their watch was practically glittering for their attention, Avery beginning to pace as they thought. Well, they hadn't cleared it first with anyone.. but how often did they really have time off? If anything happened, the alerts would pop up on their dashboard, and Avery could simply just bounce back through to deal with the problem- 

Maybe.. it'd be fine?

And Haruki never *minded* them being around- Maybe- *Probably*- 

Well, now they were thinking too much.. just-

""*Just do it, coward.*”

They waved a hand in the air, brushing away the inner thoughts before finally pushing the button. A few adjustments to the universe input, and a gateway warping with blacks and reds and blues sparked to life. A few confident and assured steps forwards, and they were warping through time and space, thrown between universes, only to pop out on the other side through a flash of orange and teal and a bit of disorientation. 

Avery let out a breath, shaking their head as they glanced around, rubbing their slightly blurred eyes before calling out. ""Hey! Anybody home? Haruki?""

There was a small sound of metal hitting tile, then the even thud of foot falls approaching from.. somewhere- It was hard to tell with how big the space was. A nearby door peaked open, the large man slightly disheveled as he glanced over to Avery. He raised a dark brow before beginning to tame his hair. ""Why are you in my house?""

""Why *wouldn't* I be in your house?"" They countered, rocking on their heels as they stuffed their mask into the pocket of their jacket.

""Because it's Christmas Eve. And you didn't call before coming over."" The man stated, walking past them in his lounge wear and heading to the coffee machine in the kitchen behind Avery. 

They turned, following after him with a playful smile on their features.

""Oh come *on* Haru, isn't there a little cheer in your bones?"" They mused, opening up a cabinet and grabbing the first edible thing they saw. ""Just like a twinge. A *tickle* of jolly?""

He rolled his eyes, filling up the mug with a black roast. ""I left it in my bed when you woke me up.""

""Ah-"" They let out a nervous chuckle at that, biting into the pretzel in their hand. ""Sorry-""

The man leaned against the counter, taking a long sip of his steaming drink before shaking his head. ""It's okay. I'm not mad."" As soon as that first sip of coffee hit him, the tension in his shoulders melted away slightly. ""What brought you over anyways?”

""It was.. too quiet."" They sighed out, pulling their fingers through medium unwashed waves. A slight look of discomfort held their features as Avery hoisted themselves easily to sit on the marble counter top. Another crunch of the pretzel stick and their gaze flickered away, just looking to keep their eyes occupied. 

""Too quiet? In *Ever-York*?"" He asked, surprise coating Haruki's words. ""I didn't think that was possible.”

""Ha!"" Avery's voice came out in a loud, ironic laugh. ""Me neither, but sometimes miracles happen-"" 

The man hummed slightly, glancing between them and his softly steaming mug. ""So, why are you *here* then?""

Avery scoffed at that, crossing their legs on the counter. ""I told you, alls quiet back in EYC and-""

""No, Avery. Why are you *here*?"" 

They paused, smile faltering as Avery avoided his pointed gaze. ""Is it so bad I wanted to harass my favorite Spider-Dad? Just see how everything was going for you, wish you a happy holiday? Does it have to be all deep and meaningful and whatever?""

""*Avery*."" The man said, his words as sharp as his dark eyes. 

They glance over to him, a bit of redness tinting their ears.

""What! I'm not *your* kid Haruki- You dont gotta *parent* me! I just came over here to see a friend. Is that so..."" They trailed off slightly, holding his gaze as the man did not waver in his sturdy position. ""Is that so bad?”

""A. Seriously? When do you *ever* get time to yourself, on *Christmas Eve* no less? And you're here, hanging out in just some dude's living room instead of enjoying the holiday on your earth. Go ice skating, walk the lights, buy some hot chocolate and watch the pigeons. Is this really what you prefer to be doing today of all days?""

""Yes."" Avery stated. If it hadn't been any other day, they would have swung back to their apartment and had some alone time, sipping a warm cup of tea, getting out the canvas, taking a nap, whatever suited the time. But Christmas Eve? No.. they didn't want to do that. 

Avery.. didn't want to be alone.

The man across from them raised a brow at the younger spider, getting a sense of their dread. ""Alright, alright. We can hang out. I'm sure something will come up for you sooner or later. I've got streaming service, so what do you want to watch?""

They perked up slightly, hopping down off the counter and moving to start pulling snacks out of his cabinets like they were the one who bought all the food. ""Something funny and sappy. That's always been my favorite-"" 

Haruki let out a chuckle, shaking his head as he walked over to the couch. ""That sounds about right."" He hummed before pulling out a remote and clicking through to find a holiday movie that fit their description.

""You know me so well, Big Red."" They chuckled, walking over to him with arms loaded up and a grin on their features. ""And.. thanks for this man. I appreciate it.""

He looked over to them with a nod, lips perked in an affectionate smirk. ""Yeah, you make it hard to say no.”

They sat together, shooting the breeze as the movie started and ended, treats were long gone, and the night had reached its latest hour. Haruki let out a yawn, rubbing at his eyes as he sighed. ""Alright.. I really should get some rest. And you should too A. It's not very often you have a moment of peace. Take it, alright? Go home, sleep, eat some food not from a take out box. Just *something* alright? For me?""

They glanced at the man, then turned their eyes back to the empty blackness of his television screen. ""Right.. peace. Sorry, I'll get out of your hair man. Sleep well okay? Enjoy your holiday, tell everyone I said hi too. I hope your celebration..."" They couldn't look away from the swallowing darkness of the screen, just a simple reflection held within it, warped from the distance, a shape they recognized but wasn't quite right. ""I hope its merry. You deserve it man."" 

Haruki gave them a look of slight worry before nodding. ""So do you.""

A few buttons pressed, a spark of lights, orange and teal and white, and they were gone. Warping and twisting, pulled through the multiverse until erupting in a flash inside their own apartment. The lights were dark, not a decoration to be found lining the small studio space. 

Save for a single candle and photo on the coffee table.

Avery took in a slightly shaky breath before sitting down on the ground, looking long and hard at the faces they recognized, but would no longer know them. Dressed in warm clothes and brilliant smiles in front of the grand tree of light annually erected in front of Stark Tower. How long ago had that photo been taken?

How.. how long had it been since they had seen those smiles?

A sharp feeling prickled behind Avery's eyes, but they pushed it down, paying it no mind. With a steady hand, they took up the lighter that sat beside the candle. It only took a single flick for the flame to ignite, and another moment of connection to set the wick burning. The soft orange glow danced with every breath Avery took.

They pressed down the tightness in their throat, filling their lungs with thoughts of confidence, of happiness, of days long past... ""Happy holidays... I-"" A single tear escaped alongside their shaking voice, muscles twitching with loss they weren’t allowed to feel. ""I miss you-"" Avery muttered out, a smile pulling wide on their features. ""But hey... At least I've got a friend now.. ain't that something- You would be proud of me..."" They nodded softly, leaning back, shoulders against the couch as they closed their eyes. ""I hope.. I hope you're proud of me.”

They let the quiet settle, ‘*peace*’ Haruki had called it.

Was this what peace felt like now?

No.. it was just.. a silent night.

          ○○○

Avery woke with a start as their holo began to ring, the individual slipping off the side of the couch with a slightly painful *thunk*, hitting the hardwood and moaning. Had they set an alarm? Was it one of their alerts-? No, no they were more like a fire alarm this was a... Their eyes peeled open, glancing at the projected image from their watch and finding themselves surprised. Haruki?

They accepted the call with a swipe, rubbing at their eyes with a light hum. ""Hey, what's up Haru?""

""*Sorry, did I wake you?*""

They waved a groggy hand before taking in a yawn. ""Yeah- no its fine- I probably needed to get up anyways-""

""*Good. Well, I talked it over with Peni last night and she gave me the all clear to invite you over for Christmas dinner*."" 

Avery paused for a moment, gears still not yet turning. ""Wait- What?""

""*Dinner.*"" The man repeated. It was a fairly simple concept, but he could tell their mind still wasn't all the way with it yet. ""*She, Kate and I are having a family dinner and, if you want, you're invited. I know you've always got your hands full, but if you're free it's at five thirty.*"" 

Christmas dinner. His *family dinner*. He.. he was inviting *them*-?

""Haru- are you.. are you sure-? I mean, isn't that supposed to be an intimate family sorta deal? I'd hate to intrude-""

""*I'm offering Avery, you didn't even ask.*"" The man said, a small smile on his face. ""*Besides.. you* are *family.*""

Avery felt a few tears pull at their eyes as the enby grinned at their friend. ""Yeah.. I'll see what I can do. Thanks Haruki. Hopefully I'll see you tonight.""

He nodded, glancing over his shoulder at a sound in the background. ""I've got to go, Peni is calling me. Merry Christmas A."" 

They let out a small chuckle, rubbing at their stinging eyes. ""Merry Christmas Red-"" 

The call ended with a light beep, Avery sat on the ground with a warm squeeze in their chest and a lightness in their heart. They hadn't felt something like that around this time of year in a while- It was.. nice. Comforting- It felt *right*.

They weren't alone, not like they used to be... Someone cared. And damn.. they'd be lying if they said it didn't feel nice-

After this decision in 2018 (!), it fell back to the city for its management / maintenance. I’m guessing that with all the budget issues our city are facing, that funds for parks, and “parks within parks” are not high on the priority list. 

I was curious if there had been any thoughts, ideas, concepts about bringing together the community to take over this space. I was thinking a space that could house a coffee shop, restaurant, public space for outdoor music (small) or something like that. I don’t know what it would cost to repair the buildings, and then maintain, and this may be why nothing seems to happen, but what if we could do something and make it a space again before the 50th anniversary of the official opening of the park?

**Image #1 Prompt:**

Create an ultra-high-resolution, close-up, photorealistic portrait of me sitting on a luxurious modern couch with Sydney Sweeney, Ana De Armas, and Cara Delevingne in an upscale contemporary bedroom. The aesthetic is high-end fashion magazine editorial photography. Change my clothing to exquisite formal. 

		Composition & Setting: The four of us are positioned naturally on a sleek, minimalist white or cream linen sectional couch. The bedroom features floor-to-ceiling windows with sheer curtains filtering soft, golden-hour light. Modern furnishings include: a statement pendant light fixture, abstract art on accent walls, polished concrete or light oak flooring, and subtle decorative elements suggesting luxury (coffee table book, minimal plant, designer accessories).

		Lighting & Mood: Cinematic, professionally lit with soft golden hour sunlight combined with subtle warm indoor lighting. Shadows are minimal and flattering. The overall atmosphere is sophisticated, relaxed elegance—like a high-fashion campaign shoot or luxury lifestyle editorial.

		Fashion & Styling: Everyone is dressed in contemporary high-fashion clothing—designer pieces in neutral, complementary tones (cream, camel, black, soft pastels). The styling suggests effortless luxury. Hair and makeup are magazine-quality, with natural radiant skin and professional grooming.

		Technical Specifications: Shot with a 50mm lens at shallow depth of field with sharp focus on all four subjects. 8K resolution, 16:9 landscape aspect ratio. Award-winning photography quality, sharp details, luxury brand aesthetic (similar to Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar editorial shoots). Color grading is warm-toned, vibrant but refined.

		Key Details: Ensure photorealistic proportions and facial features. The overall composition should feel like a candid moment from a professional fashion shoot—comfortable, elegant, and utterly convincing. Make sure that each subject's face is clearly visible in the frame.               Sharp depth from face to distant valley, natural daylight, hyper-detailed textures, realistic shadows emphasizing height. Preserve exact facial features, skin tone, hairstyle from original photo; replace background with this scene, no text, no extra people.   

**Image #2 Prompt:** 

Create an ultra-high-resolution, photorealistic image of me sitting closely with Sydney Sweeney, Ana De Armas, and Cara Delevingne on a luxurious modern couch in an upscale contemporary bedroom. The scene is intensely dramatic and frightening—a moment of pure terror as we huddle together, faces filled with fear and alarm, staring toward an unseen threat.

		The Danger: A massive window behind the couch is violently cracking and shattering from the outside. Jagged cracks spider-web across the glass, with pieces beginning to fall. Outside the window, the silhouette of a massive, otherworldly creature can be barely seen through the darkness—its shadowy form impossibly large and menacing, suggesting something ancient and unnatural pressing against the building. The glass buckling inward creates an immediate sense that the barrier between safety and horror is about to collapse.

		Composition & Framing: Extreme close-up, intimate camera placement capturing all four of us from roughly mid-torso up, packed tightly together on the couch. This creates claustrophobic intensity. Our faces dominate the frame—raw emotion visible: eyes wide with terror, mouths slightly open in fear or mid-scream. The cracking window and shadowy threat loom in the background, slightly out of focus but unmistakably ominous.

		Lighting & Mood: Cold, harsh light casting dramatic shadows across our faces. The shattering window creates jagged light patterns. Emergency lighting (perhaps from outside the window) casts sickly blue and red tones across the scene. The overall atmosphere is apocalyptic dread—a moment frozen in time where safety has shattered and only each other remains.

		Fashion & Styling: Everyone wears the same contemporary high-fashion clothing from before, but now disheveled—clothes wrinkled from panic, hair slightly disturbed. Makeup is smudged by perspiration and emotion. The contrast between luxury fashion and raw survival fear creates powerful tension.

		Technical Specifications: Shot with a 50mm lens but positioned much closer to subjects for intimate, portrait-style framing. 8K resolution, 16:9 landscape aspect ratio. Cinematic horror-thriller aesthetic—professional quality but with an unsettling, nightmarish tone. Deep focus on faces while background threat remains atmospheric and menacing.

		Key Details: Extreme emotional authenticity in facial expressions—fear, desperation, human vulnerability. The image should evoke the feeling of a pivotal survival moment. Photorealistic, visceral, and psychologically intense. The luxury bedroom setting makes the horror even more surreal—civilization and safety collapsing in real-time.",0,1766689178.0,GeminiNanoBanana2,0,0.5,False
1pvk5k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pvk5k6/second_sober_christmas/,Second Sober Christmas,"Merry Christmas, friends! Sober at that. Let’s see where I am.

I am sitting in my room on the pillows with the second mug of coffee and a headache and totally wiped out.

Everything is well. Christmas is success. I did everything right or close-to-right.

I finished end-of-the-year activities at work. Survived corporate party. It was uncomfortable, rather boring, food was less than mediocre.

Did a lot of gifts. Buying gifts is work if you care them to be heartfelt. Especially on tight budget. Wrapping is the other thing. It is production on its own.

Bought Christmas tree and decorated it.

Planned dinner and cooked. And today we are visiting my son for another dinner and gift giving.

I AM EXHAUSTED

I look back on everything I did starting around December 11th and ask myself - WHAT IS SO EXHAUSTING?

And I know what it is. It is empathy. Being able to care for others, build good moments for others is something I am not used to doing routinely. I find it stressful because I am not used to do it and every time I do it, I am running out of steam. It is overwhelming to me. Just to think about how to make gifts that bring joy as opposed to clutter is not easy after a full day of work. Not easy to me. For a normal person, I think, it is a joy to think about those gifts! But for me it is a test, an exam, an assignment. And I am afraid of failing my close ones.

If only I had time just to focus on it, I am sure I could have done it well. But I am also focusing on constant cooking as I am working on health for me and my husband. I am also working on our finances which weren’t in the greatest of shape due to my previous neglect. I am the breadwinner as my husband lost his stable job 2.5 years ago when my father died. I support my Mom. And I am leading a department at work.

Guys, Christmas is TOO MUCH for me! Sorry for whining. I fully understand that many people have it worse and I should be ashamed but here I am with crushing headache overwhelmed after shouldering all the festivities and still have to go through one more dinner.

I’d rather go to the dentist!!!!

And WHY???? Maybe I am autistic. Maybe I just do not have this one muscle that is needed to make all this celebration creation work. I think back into my drinking days and I know back in a day I would have dissociated from all this mental impact by numbing myself with alcohol. Result would have been sloppier, and I would be probably sitting right now with the similar headache only by different reason.

I do not want alcohol and I will not have it. Zero temptation. But I do understand why I was drinking it. To pull off so many things for other people is nerve wrecking to me.",13,1766689125.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

I kept every promise I ever made to Marcus. Including the stupid ones. *Especially* the stupid one.

We were seventeen, drunk on wine coolers we'd stolen from his mom's fridge, sitting on his back porch one summer evening, listening to the cicadas buzzing in the woods out back. Like we were hot shit. Like we had the whole world figured out.

""Okay, but Agnes, seriously,"" Marcus said, gesturing with his neon blue bottle in a way that suggested this was, in fact, not serious at all. ""If we're both still single at thirty, we should just date each other. We already know we don't find each other annoying.""

""Wow, Marcus. Your romantic proposition has swept me off my feet.""

""I'm saying we're compatible! We like the same movies. You laugh at my jokes—""

""I laugh at most of your jokes.""

""See? That's realistic expectations right there. That's a foundation."" He held up his bottle. ""So? Deal?""

I clinked mine against his, rolling my eyes. ""Sure. Deal.""

In a few moments, his mom would come home early and catch us mid-sip, ending our little rebellion. But right then, it felt like we were the only people in the world. The cicadas buzzed throughout the night, the stars twinkled in the distant sky, looking down on two stupid kids with their futures well ahead of them.

Here's the thing nobody tells you about stupid promises you make at seventeen: sometimes you're the only one who remembers them. Sometimes you spend twelve years being the best friend, carefully maintaining that role while privately, pathetically, counting down to thirty like it's New Year's Eve.

And sometimes, three weeks before your thirtieth birthday, your best friend calls and asks you to coffee because there's ""someone he wants you to meet.""

I knew what that meant. Obviously I knew. But I went anyway, because that's what best friends do. They show up.

---

Rachel was lovely. Like, genuinely, frustratingly, impossibly lovely. The kind of person who laughs with her whole face and asks thoughtful questions and makes you want to like her even though you desperately don't want to.

The cafe door opened, the chime tinkling like a summer breeze, announcing Marcus' arrival. He wore this easy grin he used to have when we were kids as he proudly showed me his drawings. That damned smile. It made me momentarily forget what we were doing here in the first place.

Then she walked in.

""Agnes!"" She said my name like we were already friends, pulling me into a hug, ""I've heard so much about you. Marcus says you basically taught him how to be a functional human.""

""Well, someone had to,"" I said, smiling so hard I thought my face might crack. ""He was eating cereal with orange juice when I met him.""

""I was eight,"" Marcus protested as they both took their seats. 

""You were clueless.""

Rachel laughed, bright and easy, and touched Marcus's arm. That casual intimacy. The ""we're together"" language of small gestures. I drank my latte and it tasted like sand.

""So, we've been dating about four months now,"" Marcus said, glancing at Rachel with this soft expression I'd never seen him make. Not at me, anyway. ""I wanted you guys to meet before my birthday. You know. Since you're my oldest friend and this is—"" He squeezed Rachel's hand. ""This is important to me.""

""That's amazing,"" I said. Even though my throat felt hollow, my voice sounded normal. Good job, voice. ""I'm so happy for you guys.""

I was not happy for them. I was dying inside, like something was poking my heart with a spork. I braved through it with a smile. They kept telling me stories — how they'd spent weekends together, how they were moving in next month, how everything was getting serious. I barely heard them, heart pounding as seconds ticked by. My eyes began to water. But that's fine. Everything's fine. No, seriously... I. Am. Fine.

I dashed inside my car before the crying started. I wanted to collapse right then and there, but I saw Rachel and Marcus chase after me, concerned. So I gunned it, peeling off the curb like some maniac. I bawled my eyes out then, turned the radio up so loud, I could barely hear myself think. Some random power metal track blared through the stereo as I flew down the street. Just your average heartbreak soundtrack. 

It must have been some sort of temporary psychosis. Time flew by so fast, the sun had set when I finally decided to stop driving. I had no recollection of which roads I'd taken, or where I had stopped. All I knew was I didn't want to go home. Home was where you spiral. I rested my head on the steering wheel, defeated. *Yeah, because I'm obviously doing peachy right now.*

The neon sign in front of the store depicted a wine bottle, flickering red in the gloom. I stared at it, the only sound was my car engine running.

*Ding!* went the chime as I went inside the liquor store, because if there was ever a time for bad decisions, this was it.

The clerk glanced at the counter, then at me, then at the armful of cheap wine I dropped in front of him.

He blinked. “Party?”

“Existential crisis,”

He nodded like that explained everything. “Paper or plastic?”

Drunk Agnes is significantly less rational than Sober Agnes, which is saying something because Sober Agnes once tried to dye her own hair at 2 AM and ended up orange for a month.

Drunk Agnes thought it would be meaningful to go back to the old neighborhood. To the street where Marcus and I grew up, where we'd made that stupid pact on his back porch. Maybe I was looking for closure. Maybe I was looking for evidence that I'd mattered. Maybe I was just really, really drunk.

A different family was living in that old house by now. It's a strange feeling, looking at your old haunts like a ghost. The memories were so crystal clear in your head, and on the surface, everything still looked the same, but you barely recognize the place anymore. A quiet ache settled in my bones. The light was on, the scent of home-cooked meal was inviting, and the laughter of children cut through the quiet of the night like a lighthouse in a storm. I couldn't be here. How much time, exactly, did I spend imagining my future with Marcus? I chugged from the wine bottle, forcing down the chalky, bitter-sour grape juice, grimaced and walked away.

---

The park at the end of the street looked different at night. Creepier. The swings moved in the wind like something out of a horror movie, and I was just drunk enough to think, *Yeah, perfect, this matches my vibe.*

I stumbled my way through the merry-go-round, lying on my back, staring at the distant sky, that same sky that bore witness to our pact. The stars twinkled down at me. That's when I saw it. Right above me—this weird shimmer in the air, like a lens, bending the stars from where I'm looking. Like heat waves, except it was October and I could see my breath.

""Okay,"" I said to the shimmer. ""Okay. I get it. I've finally lost my mind. This is rock bottom. This is where I'm at.""

The shimmer didn't respond, because it was a shimmer.

I reached out to it anyway.

It felt like the merry-go-round started turning slowly. It was odd. Like falling in a dream. Then it spun faster. The world twisted, my stomach lurched, and everything went sideways. Then darkness.

---

I woke up on the merry-go-round in broad daylight to children pelting me with ice cream. I immediately sat up, looking around confused. I squinted at the brightness of it all. Somewhere in the background, an extremely peppy pop song blasted through a speaker. *Was that Carly Rae Jepsen?* A student walked briskly by, sporting a backpack and multi-colored skinny jeans. I tilted my head. *Wired* earphones? I fished for my phone and was mortified— *My phone's a brick with a window*. The screen showed it was September 2013.

I was seventeen years old again, wearing my old field hockey uniform and sporting a hangover that should not exist because teenage me hadn't even been drinking last night. Except I had. Would? Time travel grammar is confusing.

I shook my head, trying to regain focus. 2013. I was in high school. And I still had all my memories from 2025, including the part where Marcus was about to move in with his girlfriend.

*Wait,* My drunk brain was still playing catch up. That hasn't happened yet. Which means... ""I have to find Marcus,"" I stood up and dusted myself off.

---

He was hard to track down. I'd forgotten that we ended up in junior year with different classes altogether. So, I spent the day being seventeen with a thirty-year-old brain, which was exactly as weird as it sounded.

I ran into Ms. Harrison in the hallway, who I'd spent junior year being terrified of. She had always been too strict — A twenty-six year-old woman wearing a blazer two sizes too big. I'm older than her now, which was a depressing fact. *You were just a kid too*, I thought as she told me not to dawdle in the hallway. Funny how the things that seemed scary at seventeen were just... people doing their best.

Lunch was Emma's drama (God, I'd forgotten about that), some massive blow-up between her and Sarah that required an emergency mediation. I got drafted into a friendship summit and spent an hour listening to teenage emotions at their most operatic while I tried not to stab my own ear with the silverware.

They made up eventually, and by last period, the three of us ended up screaming *Here's to Never Growing Up*—Avril Lavigne's ""newest"" single, getting the words wrong and laughing our goofy asses home. I saw Marcus by his beat-up Toyota in the parking lot.

He jogged up to me with this open grin and my heart did somersaults. He was gangly and unguarded, like life still hadn't taught him to be less bold. He was so, so *young*. Like we all were, once.

""Where were you?"" He asked, ""I heard about lunch. I've been texting,""

I checked my brick of a phone. Fourteen messages, ranging from, ""Did u do ur calc homework?"" to ""R U DEAD?""

There was a time where a text from Marcus would make me squeal into my pillow, feet fluttering like an Olympic swimmer, ""Just... Got busy.""

He raised his eyebrows, but didn't push. He smirked as he took my backpack and tossed it in his car, ""Tell me more about it on the way.""

""On the way to where?""

--

By the time we escaped to the arcade after school, I was exhausted. Being seventeen was *loud*. Everything mattered so intensely yet none of it meant anything. It was all so... trivial. Still, I couldn’t stop smiling.

The air was thick with sugar and static. It smelled of popcorn, sweat, and old carpet. Every sound fought to be the loudest. Coins clattered, electronics beeped, some kids shrieked as they chased each other like it's life and death. I smiled. The floor pulsed under our sneakers from the Dance Dance Revolution platform in the corner.

It was chaos — stupid, beautiful chaos. And somehow, for the first time in years, I felt like I was part of it again.

I remember this day, now. This was the day of the pact.

""You're being weird today,"" Marcus said, focused on some racing game.

""Everyone keeps saying that.""

""Because it's true."" He glanced at me. 

""Is that okay?"" I said, shifting from foot to foot.

He shrugged, ""I like your weird. You're more... here. Present.""

Because I wasn't resigned to being the best friend while secretly wanting more. I was just... with him.

And maybe that was enough. Maybe that had always been enough. A part of me wondered if we'd always been this way, and the pact ruined it. I'd wasted twelve years waiting for something that was always been here.

He laughed as the game ended, still full of that reckless seventeen-year-old energy. A message popped up. He checked his phone and shrugged, ""You up for one more stop?”

“Where?” I asked, even though I knew.

He grinned. “You’ll see.”

---

Fireflies started coming out as dusk settled over the neighborhood. His mom was out. The wine coolers were exactly where I remembered.

We settled on the back porch as the cicadas started up and the stars came out, and I waited.

We talked about anything and everything, getting progressively buzzed as we talked about high school drama, about relationships, about our futures. I had to put conscious effort into not spoiling things for him. Getting buzzed on sugar and alcohol made it significantly harder.

We were laughing about Sarah and her on-and-off-again boyfriend when Marcus said, ""Okay, but Agnes, seriously,""

My heart stopped, these were the words that had haunted me for more than a decade. He gestured with his neon blue bottle, that easy grin on his face, ""If we're both still single—""

""Stop,” I said — almost in a panic. I don’t know what came over me. I just knew I couldn’t do this to my younger self again.

Marcus froze. “I only meant—”

I placed my hand over his. Younger me would never even dream of being this bold, but I needed him to hear it.

“Marcus… what if we didn’t have to wait?”

There was a moment—just a heartbeat—where the world held its breath. Marcus stared at me, wine cooler on his hand. The cicadas seemed to have gone quiet. Even the stars seemed to pause.

""Agnes,"" he said softly. ""Are you saying—""

The back door slammed open.

""MARCUS DANIEL GREEN, ARE THOSE MY WINE COOLERS?""

We both jumped about three feet. His mom stood in the doorway, hands on hips, but her mouth was twitching like she was trying not to laugh.

""Mom! You're supposed to be at book club until ten!""

""Book club ended early because Patricia got food poisoning from gas station sushi."" She spotted me. ""Agnes, honey, you're involved in this crime too?""

""I plead the fifth,"" I said, probably too quickly.

She sighed, but she was definitely smiling now. ""Alright, hand them over. Both of you, inside. It's getting late. I'm not letting Marcus drive you home while you're buzzed.""

""Mom, we're barely—""

""Inside. Now.""

We shuffled in like guilty puppies. His mom confiscated the remaining bottles, shaking her head. ""You two are lucky I'm the cool mom. Your father would've grounded you until college.""

Marcus caught my eye and we both started giggling. His mom tried to look stern but failed completely.

""Agnes, sweetie, get your stuff"" she said. ""Marcus, you're doing dishes for a week.""

""Can we talk tomorrow?"" Marcus whispered as I grabbed my bag. His hand caught mine, just for a second. ""Like, a proper talk? Maybe... a date?""

My heart did backflips. A date. An actual date. ""Yeah. Yes. Definitely yes.""

""I'll text you in the morning.""

His mom drove me home, making small talk about school and telling me embarrassing stories about Marcus as a kid. I barely heard her. My brain was stuck on loop: He wants to go on a date. Marcus wants to go on a date with me.

When I got home, I collapsed on my bed, grinning at the ceiling like an idiot.
Tomorrow, everything would change.
Tomorrow, we'd finally talk about us.

---


I woke up in my apartment.

My adult apartment.

Grey walls, dark accents. Minimalist.

For a second, I just lay there, disoriented. Then it hit me like a freight train.

""Oh, fuck!""

I wasn't seventeen anymore. I bolted upright, grabbing my phone from the nightstand.

It was 2025. I was thirty. *We were supposed to go on a date!*

My hands shook as I scrolled through my messages. Nothing from Marcus-his number wasn't even saved on my phone. Fortunately, I'd memorized it. I called him.

Three rings, then: ""Hello?""

Wrong voice. Confused.

""I—sorry, I'm looking for Marcus Green?""

""You have the wrong number.""

*Click*, he hung up.

I tried again, making sure I used the correct digits. The same guy answered, except more pissed. He hung up, cursing at me, probably blocking my number. Not Marcus.

I sat there, phone in hand, heart pounding. *Okay. Okay, don't panic. Just... figure this out.*

I had changed the past. Of course it would ripple into the future. I just didn't realize I'd live it. Part of me wanted to slap myself silly for being the meddling bitch that I was. At the very least, I wished I'd kept a journal so I could puzzle out what had happened in the last decade in this timeline. Past me was so useless.

Social media. I could check social media.

I found Marcus on Instagram after twenty minutes of searching. His profile was public—thank God. Oregon. He lived in Oregon now. The air in my room was so still. It was so, so quiet. The distance looked small on the screen, but it wasn't. It felt bigger than miles—like we were worlds apart. The beard suited him. The smile was the same.

Software developer. Hiking. Friends I didn't recognize. A whole life I wasn't in.

I scrolled back, looking for... I don't know. Evidence of me. Evidence of us.

Nothing.

There were pictures from high school-a few group shots from parties. I spotted myself in exactly two photos, way in the background, barely visible. In one, I was talking to Emma. In the other, I was leaving.

That was it. A lifetime of friendship, erased. 

My breaths came up short, my throat tightened. *What did I do? What the hell did I do?*

I spent the next two hours stalking every social media platform, looking for clues. In this timeline, Marcus and I still knew each other but had drifted apart after that summer.

He'd gone to college in California. I'd stayed local. Our lives had diverged completely.

I tried to remember what happened after his mom drove me home.

Did our date end badly? Had I been awkward and weird? Or did it go right until I used too much tongue? I could have filled an entire notebook from the list of possible ways my seventeen-year-old self could have sabotaged us, but it didn't really matter. One thing was crystal clear: Marcus wasn't in my life.

And it was entirely my fault.

---

I reached out via Instagram. Sent him a message that I edited over and over for an entire afternoon, trying to sound casual and not at all unhinged:

*Hey! I know this is random, but I was thinking about high school the other day and realized we lost touch. Would love to catch up sometime if you're ever in the area?*

He responded a couple of hours later:
*Agnes! Wow, blast from the past. I'm actually visiting family next week. Coffee?*

We met at a Starbucks in our hometown. He looked the same but different—older, obviously, with a beard now and laugh lines around his eyes. He hugged me like an acquaintance. Polite. Friendly. Distant.

""So,"" he said, sitting down with his coffee. ""How have you been? It's been, what, twelve years?""

""Something like that, yeah,"" I nodded as if I hadn't been counting, wrapping my hands around my cup to stop them from shaking. ""How's Oregon?""

""Good! Yeah, I love it out there. The hiking is incredible."" He showed me photos on his phone—mountains, forests, a golden retriever named Max that apparently belonged to his roommate, but loved him more. ""What about you? Still in town?""

""Yeah. Still stuck here."" I said, my voice clipped.

We made small talk. He told me about his job, about learning to rock climb, about a coding bootcamp he'd taught last summer.

I told him about my work, my apartment, my painfully boring adult life.

It was fine. Pleasant, even.

It was completely wrong.

This wasn't Marcus. Not my Marcus. This was a stranger who happened to have his face, his voice, his laugh. But he was someone who hadn't shared a life with me for the last twelve years. He didn't know how cilantro tasted like soap to me, or how I knew he binged *The Office* when he was stressed. I'd never seen him cry. He'd never held my hair back when I was sick. Never spent three hours arguing with me about whether *Empire* was better than *Return of the Jedi,* (it is, by the way).

The longer I got to hear about him, the lonelier I felt. Marcus—*my* Marcus was haunting his stories, and I was mourning a friendship he had never lived. On the surface he still looked the same, but I barely recognized him.

""We should do this again,"" he said as we left. ""It's nice, reconnecting.""

""Yeah,"" I lied. ""Totally.""

We went on three more coffee dates. Then dinner. Then a movie.

He asked me out officially on date number six.

""I have to confess something,"" he said, clearing his throat as we walked downtown one Sunday morning. ""We never really talked about it, but I remember asking you out on a date when we were in high school.""

""Uh-huh,"" the blood drained from my face. We never really talked about it, because I didn't know what happened, and I was too scared to bring it up.

""I think I remember being so nervous the whole time. You were so sure of yourself, so... *you*, and... Well, I got chicken shit. I thought I blew it, made it weird between us, so I never called again.""

We stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, a sea of faces passing us by.

""I know this is kind of weird,"" he said, ""since we barely know each other anymore. But I really like you and I want to see where this goes. I'd like to think we've been given a second shot at this. What do you say?""

*If only you knew how true that is,* I thought.

I said yes because I was desperate.

Because maybe if I spent enough time with him, I'd find some trace of my Marcus in there. Because I'd already lost him once and couldn't stand to lose him again.

We dated for five weeks.

It was a disaster.

Not because he did anything wrong. He was sweet. Thoughtful. Funny in a different way. The kind that *should've* made me laugh, but just made me miss him more.

He'd moved back to town. Said working remote made more sense for his job, and his boss agreed. But I knew it was more than that. There were no hiking trails here, and the nearest climbing gym was an hour away. He'd left Max, the golden retriever, back with his roommate in Oregon. He didn't say it, but he'd moved for *us*—giving us a fighting chance.

And I was being unfair, trying to coax my Marcus out of him.

""You're somewhere else,"" he said one night after dinner. We were walking back to his car, and I'd barely said two words the whole meal. ""Where do you go?""

""I'm right here.""

""Agnes."" He stopped walking, turned to face me. ""I really like you. But sometimes it feels like you're not here with me.""

My eyes burned, my voice shook. ""I'm sorry.""

""Don't be sorry. Just... talk to me. Help me understand.""

But I couldn't. How could I explain that I was mourning a friendship that never existed in this timeline? That I'd accidentally erased our history and was now desperately trying to rebuild something with him and feeling like such an asshole for secretly wanting him to change?

""I think..."" I swallowed hard, wishing I could stop the tears, but it hurt too much, ""I think I made a mistake.""

He looked hurt. ""Dating me?""

""No. Yes. I—"" The words tumbled out wrong. ""Marcus, I don't know you. And you don't know me. And I thought maybe we could fix that, but we can't. You're gone!""

""What are you talking about?""

I was crying now, ugly-crying on a random street corner while a stranger who looked like my best friend stared at me in confusion.

""I fucked up! I fucked everything up. I wish I'd just taken the pact, even knowing what it'd cost me. God, I'll take it on again and again.""

""Agnes-""

""I'm sorry."" I backed away. ""I'm so sorry. This isn't your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. I just-I need to fix this.""

I turned and ran before he could respond.

I went straight to the liquor store. Which is now apparently the solution to every crisis. Same flickering neon sign. Same bored cashier. Same cheap wine that tasted like regret.

I drove to the old neighborhood, parked by the entrance, and walked to the park with my bottle.

The merry-go-round was still there. Rusted. Sad. Exactly like I remembered.

I sat down on it, staring up at the sky. If I'm going nuts, I might as well go full-crazy.

""Okay,"" I said to the universe. ""I get it. I screwed up. I tried to force something that wasn't meant to be, and I ruined everything. So please-please-let me fix this. Let me go back.""

Nothing happened.

I took a long drink. ""Come on. I know you're up there. I know you can hear me. I just want my best friend back. I just want Marcus in my life.""

Still nothing.

The trees were silent, the distant sky was cloudy with the stars hiding behind them. Despair. I felt the fight leave my body.

I lay back on the merry-go-round, defeated. ""What now?""

Maybe this was it. Maybe I'd destroyed what mattered most and there was no fixing it. Maybe some mistakes were permanent.

Then it happened. The clouds parted, the stars shone bright behind them, as if reaching down through the years. The shimmer looked feeble, like the tiniest disturbance might dissolve the whole thing. But it was there.

I reached up and felt that same weightlessness, but whatever force of the universe was doing it, it was struggling. The world spun, jittery, and I closed my eyes.

---

I felt it the second I crossed—heavier this time, slower, like the world hesitated before letting me back in. My stomach lurched, and then—

*Hey! I just met you...*

Carly Rae Jepsen. Again.

I was tempted to yell ""Shut up!"" before I even got my bearings.

I sat up on the merry-go-round, head spinning. The portal—or whatever it was—hadn't been a smooth ride this time. It dumped me into the past like it was on its last legs, and I knew I wouldn't get another chance. I mean—really—how often do miracles happen twice?

""Okay,"" I said, trying to focus, ice cream dripping down my hair. I was back. One more shot. No do-overs.

All I had to do was make sure everything happened exactly the way it had before—make it to Marcus's house by nightfall and say yes to the pact. Simple.

So naturally, I immediately fucked it up.

---

Turns out, even walking slightly faster is enough to break a timeline.

The first time I was here, I'd wandered like I was reliving a memory—because I was. I stopped to look. Let the day happen to me. Now I was moving with purpose. Not running, not rushing—just... intent.

And somehow, that was enough to throw everything off.

I ran into Emma in the hallway before Ms. Harrison even showed up. My heart dropped. I'd just lived through an entire miserable timeline because I'd changed the past—and here I was, doing it again.

Emma spotted me, books clutched to her chest. ""Hey—do you have a minute?"" she asked, already halfway into the sentence. Her voice had that tight edge I recognized. Something mattered. Right now.

""Actually, I—"" I stopped myself.

*Where do you go?* the other Marcus had asked me.

""Yeah,"" I cleared my throat. ""I'm right here.""

She let out a breath and started talking. About Sarah. About the drama. I listened and told her—confidently, without being cryptic—that they'd be fine. Always will. And I could see her shoulders relax.

Ms. Harrison caught sight of us before I could say more.

""Girls,"" she said, arms crossed. ""Classes.""

""Yes, Ms. Harrison,"" Emma and I said in unison, shuffling away.

I glanced back and added, ""You were always my favorite, Ms. Harrison.""

She frowned, confused. Emma elbowed me, but I just smiled.

Sometimes, that's all people need to hear.

There was no lunch drama. Part of me was relieved—and part of me panicked.

I'd changed something again.

My heart thudded as Sarah and Emma giggled across the table. My hand shook as I checked my phone.

Three messages from Marcus. Not fourteen.

The lunch blowup had been the reason he took me to the arcade.

When I suggested we put on Avril after school, my friends blasted *Sk8er Boi* instead of the new one. Sarah and Emma screeched the lyrics by heart and I nearly tore my hair out. Not that it wasn't an iconic anthem, or that my friends sounded particularly awful.

It simply meant that things were changing so drastically now that I began feeling the day slip through my fingers.

My heart sank. Marcus wasn't in the parking lot. I began pacing, breath shallow.

I texted him even though I hadn't in the original timeline. I figured this tiny detail didn't matter.

He was at the arcade.

Good.

He was early, but it's salvageable. I'd meet him there, hang out, then we'll make the pact on his porch.

Sarah dropped me off without me even having to make excuses—she and Emma had shopping to do.

The arcade's neon lights flickered red. I felt it before I even knew why. It's that feeling. Like dropping your phone into the ocean and knowing it’s gone before it even disappears. Yet you still watch it sink further and further, helpless.

I scanned the parking lot as I walked around. There was no beat-up Toyota in sight.

---

I decided to call Marcus, even though I hadn’t the first time. Because I was losing him. Because I’d already fucked up the day enough that I didn’t care anymore.

My hands shook as I brought the phone to my ear.

“Hey,” he said. His voice was steady and my knees nearly gave out.

“Hey—uh. So. Crazy thing.” I swallowed. “I’m at the arcade right now. And I don’t see your car.”

A pause.

“Yeah,” he said slowly. “I went home early. Are you okay? Are you alone?”

He must have heard something in my voice. His concern hit harder than my panic. I covered my trembling lips.

*I have been alone,* I wanted to say. I’d been fighting fate all day, and I couldn't tell it to the one person I wanted to.

“Uh-huh,” I said instead, my voice shaking.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “Mom texted—book club. I figured I’d get a few hours of COD in.”

I closed my eyes. “Of course.”

This was wrong. All of it. None of this was supposed to happen. I thought of the future where we were strangers. I could feel him slipping away. Silence stretched between us, thin and unbearable.

“I could pick you up.” he suggested.

I opened my eyes. The sky was already burning orange at the edges. There was still time—but not much. His mom would be home early. My throat tightened.

I could say yes. Let him drive to me, ride back to his house. Perhaps we'd avoid traffic. Perhaps we'd beat his mom home.

I took a breath.

“No,” I said, feet already moving. “I’ll—can I come over?”

“Agnes—”

I started jogging. “There’s something I want to tell you. In person.”

“Are you sure you're okay?”

“I will be.” My breath hitched as I broke into a run. Because waiting for him here would kill me. Because standing still felt like surrender.

“I’ll see you soon,” I said—and hung up.

---

The sun was setting as I ran, my eyes focused ahead.

The streetlights bloomed to life one by one, amber halos flickering on like a countdown. My lungs burned, my legs screamed—but I was a seventeen-year-old midfielder, not some thirty-year-old woman who’d forgotten how to breathe through panic. I’d spent entire games running until my vision went white at the edges. I knew this feeling. Pain meant I was still moving.

*There's still time.*

The world narrowed to pavement and breath and the sound of my shoes slapping asphalt. Houses blurred past—porches, hedges, parked cars I half-recognized. Somewhere ahead was Marcus’s house. His porch. That stupid stretch of wood where everything had gone wrong and right and wrong again.

*I’m not losing you.*

The thought landed heavy in my chest, sharper than the ache in my legs. I wasn’t running to change the universe. I wasn’t running for romance or destiny or some neat cosmic fix.

I was running because losing him hurt too much.

I cut through a side street, then another—muscle memory guiding me. A shortcut. I hoped. I ducked under a low branch and nearly stumbled, hands scraping bark as I caught myself. My heart slammed against my ribs, wild and frantic.

*I'll fix it. I'll fix us.*

Every step felt like it mattered. Like if I slowed, if I hesitated, the day would harden around me like amber. Lock me in a world where my best friend and I drifted apart. Because I had always lived ahead. To that porch, to twelve years from now, to when I'm thirty.

Not this time. I'll spend the years *with* him instead of looking ahead.

But if I took that pact—

I jumped the curb and landed wrong. My shoe slipped, ankle twisting. Then my knee took my full weight before momentum caught up with me. I went down hard, hands scraping against the asphalt, trying to guard my head. Still, I slammed it against the concrete.

Ringing. I tasted my skull. There was no other way to describe it. I split my lip. There was iron in my sinuses.

I opened my mouth, lips pressed on the dirt, gasping to breathe but couldn't. A dog barked across the street. Twilight swallowed the last light and the stars had come out. The cicadas buzzed all around me. It was such a quiet neighborhood, and the sound of my world collapsing couldn't penetrate that silence. I was just a stupid kid, running headfirst, literally, into the unknown.

I rolled over, sucking in air. The stars stared back.

*It's not the pact,* I thought. *It was never about it.*

Tears welled in my eyes, my heart wringing until my chest was hollow.

*Then what?* I felt helpless. I wanted to curl up right there and wilt until tomorrow took me back. But there was still plenty of time between now and then.

I groaned and gingerly sat up. I didn't know what it was about anymore. I just knew I had to be there, with him. Before I returned to a life without us.

I stood up, stumbling, pain shooting up all over my body. My knee was bleeding, gravel embedded within the swelling.

Seconds. I'd wasted seconds.

I limped once, thrice. Pain flared with each step. I ignored it and continued running. My chest burned. My throat tasted like metal. Sweat soaked through my shirt, hair sticking to my face. And I was sobbing.

But I kept going.

Because he mattered.

Because this mattered.

Because even if I was wrong—especially if I was wrong—I had to be there.

Marcus’s street came into view at the end of the block

I didn’t slow down.

---

“Marcus!"" I yelled at the house.

Silence.

I was about to yell his name again when the door flew open. He took one look at me and froze.

“Agnes—what the fuck?!"" The look on his face was priceless.

I laughed. Hysterical. Thin. It ripped out of me before I could stop it, my chest nearly collapsing in on itself with relief.

“You’re bleeding,” he said, voice barely contained, already running towards me. “Did you—did you run all the way from the arcade?”

“I’m sorry,” I was breathing heavily, hands on my knees. ""I'm sorry,"" I said again. It all came out wrong—too fast, too loud, like if I stopped talking I’d fall apart completely. 

""Why? What happened?"" He was standing next to me, hands hovering, unsure. Like I was some fragile thing he doesn't know how to handle. I couldn't blame him. I could only imagine how I looked. He was probably wondering if I'd lost my mind. Perhaps I had.

""I don't know how to say this without sounding insane,"" I said, ""but I had a dream where we stopped talking, like, for a long time, and it was suffocating and weird and—""

""You— what?""

""It was—"" I hesitated, biting my split lip, ""It felt like a weight was put on my chest and it was awful, and I tried to fix things-- God, I tried! But I just made things worse, and now I'm gonna lose you, and--""

""Hey, hey,"" He stepped closer and wrapped his arms around me, keeping me from falling apart. My shoulders shook silently.

""I have *no* idea what's gotten into you,"" he said, a smile on his voice, ""but you'll be alright. We'll be alright.""

I pressed my dumb face on his shirt. He doesn't know. That I'm saying goodbye. That I came, because I wanted to be here with him before everything fell apart. My face felt hot, I couldn't stop the tears, ""I'm sorry I messed up. I didn't mean to lose you.""

""I'm right here,"" he said gently, soothing.

""You don't understa--""

""You won't lose me,"" he held me by the shoulders, looked in my eyes, ""I promise.""

A promise.

The wind blew, pleasant after my run. The leaves sighed, hinting at the beginning of autumn. The stars looked a little brighter.

""I promise I'll stay."" He squeezed my shoulder, and somehow it steadied me, ""Even when things get messy. Even if we screw it up. Even when things get stupid— and we know things get *stupid*,""

I chuckled through my tears. I was such a mess.

""We'll be there for each other."" He finished, ""Deal?""

I gasped, my eyes widening. A heartbeat passed as I looked at him. The clinking sounds of our bottles echoed in my head. The porch light seemed to glow brighter as a realization dawned on me.

It wasn't the promise of a romance that kept us together. We were just too young to know what we truly meant.

A weird lightness bloomed in my chest. Buoyant. Persistent.

""Sure. Deal,"" I said, sniffling. The fireflies had come out, the cicadas hummed around us and the stars looked on.

---

Rachel laughed at one of my Marcus stories. The cafe was bright in that Sunday morning kind of way. I didn't mind.

""Okay, for real,"" she said, leaning forward over her latte. ""What am I supposed to get him for his birthday?""

His thirtieth. Mine had come and gone weeks ago. I sipped my coffee and found it tasted different. Not exactly bad, just... different.

""He keeps saying 'nothing' but that's obviously a trap, right?"" Rachel continued.

I laughed. ""It's not a trap. He genuinely thinks he doesn't need anything.""

""That's worse! How do I shop for someone who's content?""

""Get him something stupid. A mug with a terrible pun. Socks with dogs on them. He'll love it because it's ridiculous and because you thought of him.""

She pulled out her phone, already searching. ""Socks with dogs. I can work with that.""

It had been three months since that disastrous coffee date when Marcus introduced Rachel and I.

I'd apologized and blamed my dramatic exit to me feeling ill. They didn't question it. I asked them out for another coffee date the next week. It was a little awkward, both Rachel and I tried too hard, talking around Marcus instead of to each other. The second one was better. By the third, we'd stopped performing.

Now it was just... easy.

Rachel was lovely. Still. Genuinely, frustratingly lovely. But I'd also learned she talked too loudly in movie theaters, always ordered the wrong thing at restaurants and spent the whole meal eyeing everyone else's plates. She got weirdly competitive about board games.

She was real. Flawed. Human.

And she loved Marcus.

""Found them!"" Rachel showed me her phone—socks covered in golden retrievers.

I laughed. Of course she picked that. ""Perfect. He'll wear them until they disintegrate.""

We chuckled until a message dinged on her phone. Marcus was supposed to pick her up.

""You're the best."" She flagged down the waiter for the check. ""We should do this again next week. Maybe wine instead of coffee?""

I made a face. ""I think I'm done with wine for a while.""

""Bad experience?""

""I'm honestly not sure,"" I said then cleared my throat, ""How about movie night at my apartment? You've seen *Star Wars*, right?""

""Oh, my God, yes. I love *Empire* the best."" She grinned and pulled me into a hug as we stood to leave. She smelled like vanilla and gave hugs that were just as sweet. ""Thanks for this. For helping.""

The door chimed as Marcus walked in, right on time to pick Rachel up. He hugged me—quick and familiar—while Rachel gathered her things.

""You two bonding over my many flaws?"" he asked.

""Absolutely,"" Rachel said. ""Agnes told me about the exploding basketball.""

""Hey, that was really scary,""

""Still counts.""

They left together, Rachel's hand finding his, their voices fading as the door closed behind Marcus.

I decided to stay for a bit. Ordered another coffee. Pulled out my laptop like I had work to do, but mostly I just sat there, watching the café move around me.

She wasn't taking Marcus from me. She was just loving him. Different than I did, but not less. Not more. Just... different.

And that was okay.

I took a sip of my coffee and smiled at nothing in particular.

The door opened behind me—the little bell chiming bright and clear.

**Image #1 Prompt:**

Create an ultra-high-resolution, close-up, photorealistic portrait of me sitting on a luxurious modern couch with Sydney Sweeney, Ana De Armas, and Cara Delevingne in an upscale contemporary bedroom. The aesthetic is high-end fashion magazine editorial photography. Change my clothing to exquisite formal. 

		Composition & Setting: The four of us are positioned naturally on a sleek, minimalist white or cream linen sectional couch. The bedroom features floor-to-ceiling windows with sheer curtains filtering soft, golden-hour light. Modern furnishings include: a statement pendant light fixture, abstract art on accent walls, polished concrete or light oak flooring, and subtle decorative elements suggesting luxury (coffee table book, minimal plant, designer accessories).

		Lighting & Mood: Cinematic, professionally lit with soft golden hour sunlight combined with subtle warm indoor lighting. Shadows are minimal and flattering. The overall atmosphere is sophisticated, relaxed elegance—like a high-fashion campaign shoot or luxury lifestyle editorial.

		Fashion & Styling: Everyone is dressed in contemporary high-fashion clothing—designer pieces in neutral, complementary tones (cream, camel, black, soft pastels). The styling suggests effortless luxury. Hair and makeup are magazine-quality, with natural radiant skin and professional grooming.

		Technical Specifications: Shot with a 50mm lens at shallow depth of field with sharp focus on all four subjects. 8K resolution, 16:9 landscape aspect ratio. Award-winning photography quality, sharp details, luxury brand aesthetic (similar to Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar editorial shoots). Color grading is warm-toned, vibrant but refined.

		Key Details: Ensure photorealistic proportions and facial features. The overall composition should feel like a candid moment from a professional fashion shoot—comfortable, elegant, and utterly convincing. Make sure that each subject's face is clearly visible in the frame.               Sharp depth from face to distant valley, natural daylight, hyper-detailed textures, realistic shadows emphasizing height. Preserve exact facial features, skin tone, hairstyle from original photo; replace background with this scene, no text, no extra people.   

**Image #2 Prompt:** 

Create an ultra-high-resolution, photorealistic image of me sitting closely with Sydney Sweeney, Ana De Armas, and Cara Delevingne on a luxurious modern couch in an upscale contemporary bedroom. The scene is intensely dramatic and frightening—a moment of pure terror as we huddle together, faces filled with fear and alarm, staring toward an unseen threat.

		The Danger: A massive window behind the couch is violently cracking and shattering from the outside. Jagged cracks spider-web across the glass, with pieces beginning to fall. Outside the window, the silhouette of a massive, otherworldly creature can be barely seen through the darkness—its shadowy form impossibly large and menacing, suggesting something ancient and unnatural pressing against the building. The glass buckling inward creates an immediate sense that the barrier between safety and horror is about to collapse.

		Composition & Framing: Extreme close-up, intimate camera placement capturing all four of us from roughly mid-torso up, packed tightly together on the couch. This creates claustrophobic intensity. Our faces dominate the frame—raw emotion visible: eyes wide with terror, mouths slightly open in fear or mid-scream. The cracking window and shadowy threat loom in the background, slightly out of focus but unmistakably ominous.

		Lighting & Mood: Cold, harsh light casting dramatic shadows across our faces. The shattering window creates jagged light patterns. Emergency lighting (perhaps from outside the window) casts sickly blue and red tones across the scene. The overall atmosphere is apocalyptic dread—a moment frozen in time where safety has shattered and only each other remains.

		Fashion & Styling: Everyone wears the same contemporary high-fashion clothing from before, but now disheveled—clothes wrinkled from panic, hair slightly disturbed. Makeup is smudged by perspiration and emotion. The contrast between luxury fashion and raw survival fear creates powerful tension.

		Technical Specifications: Shot with a 50mm lens but positioned much closer to subjects for intimate, portrait-style framing. 8K resolution, 16:9 landscape aspect ratio. Cinematic horror-thriller aesthetic—professional quality but with an unsettling, nightmarish tone. Deep focus on faces while background threat remains atmospheric and menacing.

		Key Details: Extreme emotional authenticity in facial expressions—fear, desperation, human vulnerability. The image should evoke the feeling of a pivotal survival moment. Photorealistic, visceral, and psychologically intense. The luxury bedroom setting makes the horror even more surreal—civilization and safety collapsing in real-time.",4,1766689060.0,GeminiNanoBanana,0,1.0,False

"".....are you guys being serious right now?""

""I swear, Admiral is a timeline saving hero for real!""

""For real, for real!""

""If getting a girlfriend roleplay audio amounts to 'timeline saving' for you lot, then I had something to do with that too! I mean, it's not like I wrote the script or anything...""

""Hey, guys? I- I think I can see Santa.""

""What....?""

""Yeah, he uh- woah, he's coming this way on a sleigh. There are reindeers and stuff. And- And there's a goth girl with him. Hehe, sweeeeet! But wait...there's- there's two goth girls sitting with him! Nah. Four. Four! You guys, are you seeing this? Why- why is Santa riding in a sleigh with FOUR DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS GOTH GIRLS ?!""

""Somebody, PLEASE dispose of the mushrooms! I told you guys to lay off that shit.""

""Hey guys, can we uh-""

""NO!""

""But-""

""......""

Rain, why- why can't Santa just give me a goth girl who'll love me?

"".....I don't know, buddy. I wish I could tell you. But you know what I *can* tell you?""

""What?""

""I can tell you about how awesome Scarlet and her audios are.""

"".....okay. That- that does sound kinda nice. I always liked her content. How did you come to know about her?""

""Well, I think the very first audio of Scarlet's that I listened to was [this hidden treasure about a snow witch / yuki-onna](https://youtu.be/H6I8LLFvwkw?si=6Uot5N_1sCe7jNNh). Remember earlier when the guys were complaining about the timing? Well, tell 'em if they want a Christmas-y audio, then it's right here! I was absolutely blown away- deadass- the first time I listened. Scarlet's attention to detail and mastery of sound effects are out of this world! If the word *immersive* had a tinder profile, its picture would be that of a Scarlet audio.""

""That's....unnecessarily specific.""

""But it's so much more than that. Her voice, it's- and I say this with pure, detached professionalism- it's like the gods took a ray of warm sunshine from a winter's day, the scent of spring from a gentle breeze, the sweetness from a hazy dream, the spice from a witch's aphrodisiac, the light from an angel's halo, the caress of an empress's velvet dress, the mystery of the night, the essence of a childhood memory- and from all these things was Scarlet's voice made, and yet, to the confusion of the gods, it was something greater than the sum of its many parts.""

""That's....even more unnecessarily specific. Professionalism where? But I gotta admit, she does have a very *bark for me* kinda voice.""

""Don't talk about her like that!""

""Hey, chill out! That was a compliment. Her voice is compelling, is what I meant to say. Sheesh! When I listened to her ""kitsune turns you into her puppy"" audio, I legit barked. It was like hypnosis.""

""Yeah well, I guess she does play the...the, you know....the-""

""Dommy mommies?""

""I was going to say, the tasteful, seductive, disarming femme fatales. But yeah, she- she does play them very well.""

""I'd bet my life's savings on it, she does.""

""But you know something? My favourite Scarlet performances are actually- well, they're not so much about the Fdom stuff, but rather....I don't really know how to describe it. She makes the listener feel seen, and heard, and appreciated, I guess? It's the cute girl next door, or the- the childhood crush archetypes of hers that I really love.""

""Gay.""

""Yeah sure, listening to F4M is gay. Man, I'm starting to see why Santa doesn't let you score with any goth girls.""

""Dude....""

""Okay, I'm sorry. That was low. But all I'm trying to say is....my favourite audio of Scarlet's is [probably this one](https://youtu.be/4B9PdZj4Uv0?si=j8BxX1XlbySjDpY2). I don't even think of it as yandere. She just plays the character of....you know, that girl you admire from a distance, and you just know she's out of your league, and it's not even the depression and self-deprecation talking- you just know she glides over the clouds. Quite literally, in that audio. But she does see you. And she loves you, more than you'll ever know. And she isn't afraid of telling you that. Even if the script puts her in a controlling or dominant dynamic with you, she still gets across what she really wants. Just you. That's the kind of girl Scarlet channels like lightning. Her portrayal makes the character's humanity shine through, because you know what?""

""What....?""

""Kindness IS punk rock! Boom, said it! It's a Supergirl audio for a reason, and just like the character herself, Scarlet is pretty much a symbol of hope in this niche. How about that, for unnecessarily specific?""

""Hey um, Rains?""

""What?""

""We did it again. We....we forgot to turn off the device. We're still live.""

""......""

""Rains? Buddy?""

""How's Antarctica this time of year?""

**SCRIPT:**

(Heated) Well I don’t understand! Why do you have to go to work to feel good about yourself?

Of course you’re free to work! I’m not- (humourless laughter) I’m not some kind of controlling monster! I’m not. I’m just asking, what is the *need* for you to spend eight hours, five days a week, crunching numbers on a spreadsheet, when you could be spending that time with me?

I already make enough money for the both of us, don’t I? Look around us. I spent so much time making everything perfect for when you finally, finally moved in with me! I thought we’d finally get to spend more time together. (Softening slightly) You- You don’t ever have to work again. Honey, I can get you anything you’d ever want. I’m a freaking witch, for god’s sake.

(Irritated) Oh, shut up! What do you mean you want to *contribute* to our relationship? You think working a desk job contributes something to what we have?

No, it doesn’t! I want you. Just you. Stop pretending this is about us. It’s just- just your damn ego, your need to be the breadwinner and shit! You think being a- what, a househusband makes you any less of a man?

Yeah, that’s the point. Of course it doesn’t! Anybody who thinks otherwise is living in the past century. Which you’re not, so then- (exhaling frustrated) I don’t see what’s the problem!

Yes? What is it? Tell me why you need to work. Tell me why you’re being so difficult. Why- (taking a deep breath, softening her tone)- why are we having this conversation?

(A longer pause)

It gives you purpose....? Are you being serious?

No, okay that’s- yeah, okay. Sure. It gives you *purpose.*

Uh huh.

I thought being with me was enough for you. I thought *I* was enough.

Sure, it’s not like that. There must be something I’m missing, love. You say you care about me, but clearly not more than your work. That’s more important to you, isn’t it?

(Flaring up) I am listening! It’s *you* who refuses to listen!

(Breathing intensely, trying to calm herself again)

Look, I’m sorry. (Rubbing her temples, sighing heavily) I’m sorry, okay? I don’t *want* to yell at you. I don’t like doing that. But this is really, really important to me. (Beseeching) Why won’t you let me take care of you?

No, I don’t do enough of that. Not *nearly* enough. I don’t like it when you’re away from me. I can’t protect you when you’re out there by yourself. And I....I don’t like feeling that way, alright?

There’s really no reason for you to work anymore. No reason for you to go outside without me. I will take care of everything. I always do.

Honey. Honey, wait! Don’t walk away! We’re not done talking.

(Aghast) What do you mean, I never respect your feelings? That’s....that’s just wrong. Your feelings, they matter to me more than anything in the world! You wanted to spend more time with me. You told me that yourself! That’s why I’m doing this.

Well of course it’s for myself too! You’re my boyfriend, for fuck’s sake! And I happen to- you know- I happen to love you? Why on earth would I not want to keep you closer to me?

(Distraught) Honey, don’t be like that. Don’t go! Where are you going?

Outside? But I *just* told you to-

Wait. We’re not done here. Get back!

(Shaky breathing) You’re walking away from me. This....this is what you always do.

(Forlorn) You know I hate it when you leave, but you always do it anyway. Why....why can’t we ever do things the easy way?

(A lingering pause)

(Coolly) Whatever.

*(SFX: Channelling a burst of magic, akin to electricity)*

*(SFX: Objects clattering to the floor)*

*(SFX: Quiet footsteps towards the listener. Eerie silence.)*

What is it? Can’t get up?

You can’t feel your legs? (Dripping with mock sympathy) Awwww, honey. That’s a bit of a pickle, isn’t it? How are you going to walk away from me if you can’t feel your legs?

You want to know what I did?

(Quiet, eerily calm) Oh, not much. I told you how I don’t like it when you’re away from me. Soooo....I paralyzed you from your knees all the way down. (Whispering) Permanently.

(Shushing him gently, crooning) It’s okay, love. Sssshhh. Sssshhhh. It’s okay. At least now, we don’t have to fight anymore. Because you’re not going anywhere.

You’ll stay with me, right here. Won’t you, my sweet?

Does it hurt? Poor darling. It was only a little zap. Your legs feel numb, not in agony. I know. I couldn’t bear to see you hurt, in agony. I just couldn’t. (Frowning softly) But there might be a dull, lingering ache in your legs for a few minutes. Kind of like, you know, after you’ve run a really long distance. You won’t ever feel such sensations again, because....well, because you won’t be running ever again.

I’m sorry, my love. I’ll take it all away. Let’s get you into bed first. Hold still.

Shush, honey. I’m just lifting you in the air with my magic. Don’t move around so much. Don’t want you hitting your head around any corners, now do I? (An amused little laugh)

Come along, dear. Let’s get you into bed.

*(SFX: Soft footsteps walking away)*

...

.....

.......

*(SFX: Faint rainfall outside)*

Hey.

(Smiling affectionately) How are you feeling, honey?

Hmn. You fell asleep for a while back there. Must have been the sound of the rain falling outside. Did you sleep well?

Love?

(Sighing, pouting) Still giving me the cold shoulder, I see.

It has been nearly two weeks, you know? I’d have thought you’d be used to it by now. Used to being in bed all day, as I bring you chamomile tea and butterscotch pastries and shortbread cookies, and spoon feed you because you refuse to eat, and then I just cuddle up to you as we watch your favourite shows together. (Pouting) I was starting to believe you were finally coming around.

(Rolling her eyes) Yes, yes. Your evil witchy girlfriend paralyzed you. Walk it off. Oh, wait. Never mind.

Well? That was kinda funny, don’t you think?

Honey. You’d normally be laughing at that. Or at least cracking a smile. What is it, hm? Why are you sad?

(Big, curious eyes) Please, just tell me.

Do you miss your legs again? Do you wish you could walk around like you used to?

(Sighing softly) Would you like to go outside in the garden for a bit? I can get your wheelchair.

Well, the rain won’t affect us. I can just put up a barrier.

No....? Are you sure?

Hm. As you wish, my sweet. (Pecking his cheek)

(With a twinge of sadness) You flinched again. I- I’m not going to hurt you. You know that, right? I would never hurt you.

(Steely, with the slightest tremor of guilt) Yes. Because I’ve already hurt you enough.

Please don’t flinch away from me. I have never hit you, have I? I’m not going to hurt you. I swear it.

(Lingering silence)

I drew a cat on your wheelchair, you know?

Yeah. I think it’s cute. You like cats, right?

(Deflating)....oh.

(Quietly) Well, I thought you liked them.

Hm? I’m sorry, my love?

You’re begging me to restore your legs? (Sighing) This again?

No. I told you, the spell is permanent.

Well yeah, I guess I could reverse it if I tried. Pretty sure I could, actually. But I’m not going to.

Because it’s *supposed* to be permanent. Because doing that would defeat the purpose. And also because I just don’t want to do that. I kinda like this, you know?

I really can’t figure out why you’re being so grumpy. It’s not like I paralyzed the *entire* lower half of your body. (Whispering) You’re not limp where it really counts. (Sultry laughter)

Oh, I’d say you’re still *plenty* attracted to me, love. It’s quite....um, evident, you see. And it’s not your fault! I’m a witch. We’re all beautiful. But more importantly....(whispering softly) it’s because you still love me.

Yeah. You do. I can read your mind, you know?

Oh? Didn’t I tell you that before? Ooopsie! (Light giggles)

Well, how about we make a deal then? I won’t get inside your head, if you start talking to me again.

(Solemn, wistful) You know what I mean. It feels like forever since we’ve had an actual conversation. These days, you just....you just respond with a couple of words or one liners or you just ignore me. It hurts my feelings, you know?

Of course I have feelings. (Pouting) You don’t have to be so mean. I- I know what you’re trying to do.

You’re trying to rile me up, so I’ll lash out at you. Say hurtful things. And that’ll make it easier for you to hate me.

Yeah well, I’m not going to do that. I don’t like it when we fight. I hated every moment of our last argument. I just....I have a temper, okay? And I don’t like directing it at you. You don’t deserve to see me at my worst. So I’m not going to show that side of myself to you again. I....I promise I’m going to be patient, and gentle, and loving. (Pecking his cheek again) I will be the best girlfriend ever.

Someday you’ll stop turning your face away when I try to kiss you.

Yeah. You will. (Sighing) Anyway, if you’re not going to wrap your arms around me, then I might as well bind them.

Oh, shush. I’m not going to paralyze your arms. I’m not crazy, despite what you keep insisting. I’m just going to tie them spread-eagled with invisible ropes. Like this.

Well, it’s better this way because you can’t push me away. I can cuddle you in peace.

*(SFX: Soft rustling of blankets)*

There. This is not so bad, is it? When I rest my head on your chest? A few loose strands of my hair might be tickling your chin, but well....what are you going to do about it? (Laughing softly)

Let me hold you. You’re my treasure. I’m so glad to have you, you know?

I really do love you. I just....I get a bit possessive sometimes. (Pouting, muttering) It’s only because I care about you.

Really, honey, as far as dating witches goes....you’ve got the better end of the deal. Some of my friends keep their lovers as thralls, so they’ll never break up. Some of them slip love potions into their darling’s coffee every morning. Others bind their lovers through magical contracts. One of my friends even turned her boyfriend into a cat.

No, all of us aren’t crazy. She only turned him into a cat as punishment, because he didn’t reply to her texts for 24 hours. She’ll turn him back eventually. (Muttering) I think.

All I’m trying to say, is your *predicament* really isn’t so bad! I fulfil your every need, every want. I finally get to take care of you, and spoil you the way I’ve always wanted to. And you can’t run away from me anymore. I.....I don’t have to worry about losing you.

Yeah. You are dependent on me now. And I like it. Is that really so wrong? You should be able to depend on your girlfriend. It’s okay to let go, and let her take care of things for you.

(Soft) You used to tell me how you wanted to see me more often. But you felt like I was always so busy brewing potions and reading ancient treatises on charms and alchemy and demonic rituals. And so I asked you to move in with me. I was so happy when you said yes! I thought I was going to see more of you too. So much more. But then....you had to run off to do your own work.

I don’t want to undo the spell. I- I don’t think I could ever trust you not to leave me after what I did. It would break my heart if I lost you. I’d be devastated. I can’t just reverse the spell, my sweet. (Faintly) Not as things are right now. I’m sorry.

However....maybe.....(taking a deep breath).....just maybe, there are other ways of....you know....securing your commitment to me.

(Slowly caressing his cheek) I’m not going to promise you anything. But I’d be- I’d be willing to talk about it. Yeah. If you’re good for me. If you....love me like you used to.

I just want to be with my husband.

We’re not married? (Pouting) Well, not with that attitude, we’re not.

I know this isn’t how you imagined things to be, but....but I’m still here with you. And I will always be. I’m going to marry you, bind you to me with a special contract- marital *and* magical- and I’m going to pamper you every day for the rest of our lives together. (Kissing him) I love you so much, honey.

(Whispering) I really do.

His brain pretty much goes blank and he just isn’t ever the one to ferret out some “wow special” idea. It’s something I’ve gotten use to after 10 years together (almost 5 married), and we instead used to prioritize making special time together and engaging in meaningful conversation as a way to feel close and loved. 

So some years I would still feel deflated by a meh gift. But quickly moved past it. 

But this year we are coming off the addition of our second child, so we not only have literally no personal time anymore, but we’ve also been really struggling to come back from the brink of some very bad fights. 

I feel guilty that I never expressed a higher expectation for an amazing gift. But I guess I was just hoping for something that made me feel extra special since things have been so hard. 

I got him a planned weekend trip for the summer. He got me some nice but very impersonal coffee supplies (new mug, etc) that I don’t actually need. 

How do I productively express that I am bummed out to him without him feeling like I’m just making him feel bad (his confidence and feeling inadequate has been a big underlying cause of fights lately, which we are trying to talk through already)?

Create an ultra-high-resolution, photorealistic image of me sitting on a luxurious modern couch with Sydney Sweeney, Ana De Armas, and Cara Delevingne in an upscale contemporary bedroom. The aesthetic is high-end fashion magazine editorial photography. Change my clothing to exquisite formal.

	Composition & Setting: The four of us are positioned naturally on a sleek, minimalist white or cream linen sectional couch. The bedroom features floor-to-ceiling windows with sheer curtains filtering soft, golden-hour light. Modern furnishings include: a statement pendant light fixture, abstract art on accent walls, polished concrete or light oak flooring, and subtle decorative elements suggesting luxury (coffee table book, minimal plant, designer accessories).  
  
	Lighting & Mood: Cinematic, professionally lit with soft golden hour sunlight combined with subtle warm indoor lighting. Shadows are minimal and flattering. The overall atmosphere is sophisticated, relaxed elegance—like a high-fashion campaign shoot or luxury lifestyle editorial.  
  
	Fashion & Styling: Everyone is dressed in contemporary high-fashion clothing—designer pieces in neutral, complementary tones (cream, camel, black, soft pastels). The styling suggests effortless luxury. Hair and makeup are magazine-quality, with natural radiant skin and professional grooming.  
  
	Technical Specifications: Shot with a 50mm lens at shallow depth of field with sharp focus on all four subjects. 8K resolution, 16:9 landscape aspect ratio. Award-winning photography quality, sharp details, luxury brand aesthetic (similar to Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar editorial shoots). Color grading is warm-toned, vibrant but refined.  
  
	Key Details: Ensure photorealistic proportions and facial features. The overall composition should feel like a candid moment from a professional fashion shoot—comfortable, elegant, and utterly convincing.

**Image #2 Prompt:**

Create an ultra-high-resolution, photorealistic image of me sitting closely with Sydney Sweeney, Ana De Armas, and Cara Delevingne on a luxurious modern couch in an upscale contemporary bedroom. The scene is intensely dramatic and frightening—a moment of pure terror as we huddle together, faces filled with fear and alarm, staring toward an unseen threat.

	The Danger: A massive window behind the couch is violently cracking and shattering from the outside. Jagged cracks spider-web across the glass, with pieces beginning to fall. Outside the window, the silhouette of a massive, otherworldly creature can be barely seen through the darkness—its shadowy form impossibly large and menacing, suggesting something ancient and unnatural pressing against the building. The glass buckling inward creates an immediate sense that the barrier between safety and horror is about to collapse.  
  
	Composition & Framing: Extreme close-up, intimate camera placement capturing all four of us from roughly mid-torso up, packed tightly together on the couch. This creates claustrophobic intensity. Our faces dominate the frame—raw emotion visible: eyes wide with terror, mouths slightly open in fear or mid-scream. The cracking window and shadowy threat loom in the background, slightly out of focus but unmistakably ominous.  
  
	Lighting & Mood: Cold, harsh light casting dramatic shadows across our faces. The shattering window creates jagged light patterns. Emergency lighting (perhaps from outside the window) casts sickly blue and red tones across the scene. The overall atmosphere is apocalyptic dread—a moment frozen in time where safety has shattered and only each other remains.  
  
	Fashion & Styling: Everyone wears the same contemporary high-fashion clothing from before, but now disheveled—clothes wrinkled from panic, hair slightly disturbed. Makeup is smudged by perspiration and emotion. The contrast between luxury fashion and raw survival fear creates powerful tension.  
  
	Technical Specifications: Shot with a 50mm lens but positioned much closer to subjects for intimate, portrait-style framing. 8K resolution, 16:9 landscape aspect ratio. Cinematic horror-thriller aesthetic—professional quality but with an unsettling, nightmarish tone. Deep focus on faces while background threat remains atmospheric and menacing.  
  
	Key Details: Extreme emotional authenticity in facial expressions—fear, desperation, human vulnerability. The image should evoke the feeling of a pivotal survival moment. Photorealistic, visceral, and psychologically intense. The luxury bedroom setting makes the horror even more surreal—civilization and safety collapsing in real-time.",3,1766688318.0,AiGeminiPhotoPrompts,1,1.0,False

Some backstory: I am from a shitty home, I left early when I could and had a good friend circle until two couples accused each other of cheating. Everyone took sides and those who didn’t also got shit, so the circle kind of broke apart. I then met someone on the internet. Although he was kinda pressuring, I didn’t have anyone else and so I clung to him. It continued like that for several years. He was from the UK, I am from Switzerland. He visited me several times in those years. The relationship had its downs but also its ups, I kind of blamed myself for the downs.



Although I had a job, I was always really depressed and antidepressants made it worse after trying three different ones. Since I had no family, no friends, and my job was very exploitative, I took my cat and most of the stuff I had and kinda moved in with him in the UK since he offered to take care of me.



I know it was a very stupid choice. I don’t think I planned to stay alive for that long there, I just wanted someone to care for my cat when I am gone, since my cat is familiar with him, I did try to kill myself a couple times but always failed.



It’s been two years now. I am an illegal alien here, I do not work and he does pay for everything, although proud to say he spends less money now than when he was alone, since he has huge debts and I sorted out his finances and debt repayments etc., which I didn’t even know about when I moved there and only after over half a year I realized he was always in minus or buying food on credit cards.



I am at home unless we have to go grocery shopping and don’t leave otherwise. I clean, I cook, I am the homemaker, which I don’t mind as he provides the money, it’s only fair.



He did kind of gotten worse over time, mcuh worse, and although I am grateful for him taking care of me, he lied a lot and generally has lots of issues. One of his big things is anger issues that I am always on the receiving end of multiple times. These days I am always bruised because he gets physical alot and scared when things piss him off, which is basically everything. He works, he shits, he has his coffee and is on his PC. We don’t do much together as he will get mad at it. We barely have sex, although he did tell me before, both in rage and casually, he could rape me if he cared enough. He also said the same thing about killing me and I think one time he did try actively and two times passively.



Then again, he buys me and my cat food, I can sleep here, use the shower, Wi-Fi, live here etc., and I do argue with him a lot, so I am not fully innocent here.



I told him I’d go back but 1. he is not happy about that whatsoever 2. I can’t go back. I have no money. I used all my savings to move and the little that was left to buy things I couldn’t bring (cat tree, cat toilets etc.). Even if I had money for a plane ticket, I don’t want to leave my cat here and neither my things because at least 1/3 are sentimental things and he would destroy them.



I know I would get banned from the UK, which is fine. I am a bit worried about him coming after me but I would handle it somehow.



On the other hand, I am just tired. I have no one and nothing in Switzerland. I tried finding a job but without an address that is hard, and no address, no job. I would have no furniture, etc. etc.



I tried making money, but nothing pans out. No under-the-table jobs in town, no remote work, study sites don’t bring anything, making art/things is also not working. I even tried sex work but the market is oversaturated.

Only a handful of times he made me feel guilty about providing for me, which is fair, but he insisted I come here and it's fine and I really don't use much food or water or anything, but I do make sure my cat is fine.

Does anybody have any other ideas on how to get money?

1pvjp2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belgrade/comments/1pvjp2e/where_is_life_in_belgrade/,Where is life in Belgrade?,"Hi guys,

After a few days in Belgrade, we’re honestly a bit confused. For a capital city, it feels surprisingly quiet and low-energy. Not quite many Christmas Markets, events, festive decorations etc..

Knez Mihailova was often almost empty, and we struggled to find lively places for coffee or drinks with real atmosphere. Even Skadarlija, which everyone recommends, didn’t feel that special to us — nice, but very touristy and not exactly alive.

This gives us the impression that the city has limited everyday social life, at least in the areas one would expect it. Another thing that stood out a lot: smoking indoors. It’s hard to enjoy cafés or bars when smoking is still allowed everywhere — and as far as we know, Serbia is one of only a couple of countries where this is still the case. Even from Greece that we come from, this rule is being applied.

That said, we’re open to the idea that we might be completely wrong or just missed the right spots. If so, we’d genuinely appreciate recommendations:
	•	Lively neighborhoods
	•	Streets with café/bar culture
	•	Places where locals actually hang out

1pvjo32,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenStack/comments/1pvjo32/compact_microwave_tested_in_small_kitchen_setup/,Compact Microwave Tested in Small Kitchen Setup and Here's What Stood Out,"Picked up the farberware countertop microwave oven, and the unit I tested was the Model FARBERWARE 0.7 cu ft (black). I work on appliances for a living around Aurora, and I run these like they’re going into a real kitchen, not a showroom. Size-wise it’s genuinely compact at about 17.75 wide and 10.1 tall, and it fit my tighter countertop spot without blocking outlets or cabinet doors.

Power output is the main compromise: 700 watts will heat food, but efficiency is more about patience than speed. A mug of coffee and leftovers got hot, just slower than the 900-1100W competitors. Heating consistency was decent for the class thanks to the turntable, though the interior and turntable space are small enough that big dinner plates and tall bowls can be a no-go. Defrost performance was better than expected on frozen bread and a chicken portion, but you’ll still babysit timing because many package instructions assume higher wattage.

Auto cook programs work, but they feel like the generic one-touch presets most commodity microwaves share. Control panel usability is mostly fine: big digital display, timer and clock display are easy to read, and the memory function is handy if you reheat the same stuff daily. One annoyance from other owners lines up with my experience: the child safety features include an unlock behavior that takes a minute to get used to, and if you’ve got kids around it’s nice, if you don’t it can feel like friction.

Door handle design is a mixed bag. This one uses a push-button style, and it takes more force than I like, which can hurt countertop stability and make the microwave slide back unless you add a grippy mat. Noise level is average for the fan hum, but the beeper level is… a lot. Multiple loud beeps at end-of-cycle can get old fast in an apartment.

Ease of cleaning is solid because the interior wipes out quick and the controls are sealed. Lighting visibility is very bright, which I prefer for spotting boil-overs. Build quality and durability are the big question mark: plenty of people get a sturdy unit, but reports of dents on arrival and even early failure after a few weeks make me cautious.

Price lands in the budget tier, and vs similar small 0.7 cu ft microwaves, I’d only pay for it if the sale is good and you’re fine with slower cook times and that loud alarm. Energy consumption stays reasonable for a small 700W unit, plus it’s less breaker-trippy than bigger microwaves, which matters in older homes.",1,1766687801.0,KitchenStack,0,1.0,False

[**Hiemal – Estimated Year: 216 After** ]()**Nuclear Winter**

# [**1**]()

Frost could always be counted upon during the three months that make up Hiemal.  Lavender had heard that the weather that changed with each division of the year here in RC3 wasn’t as dramatic - if it happened at all - in RC2.  She wondered to herself bitterly while she waited in the frozen inky black of night for game in the barrens what that must be like.  Having all your nights away from Authority eyes wrapped in air as warm as breath no matter if it was Aestival or not.  The game probably enjoyed it as much as she imagined she would.

Then again, it could be worse.  She could be a resident of RC4, which seemed to be permanently encapsulated in snow.  Its residents grizzled from hard temperatures and times in equal measure. No, Lavender couldn’t be certain of any of the rumors she heard about the other three RCs under Authority’s control. They were too widespread to allow for easy communication between the average citizens.  This, of course, was by design.  The less interaction, the less likely an uprising.  Not that anyone was attempting to fight.  Resignation to their lots in life had settled on the survivors the same way ash settled on all the remains of civilization. People were grateful for what Authority provided, and nobody questioned if there were inequities.  Inequities were all everyone knew in post Fallout.  Besides, when real monsters roamed the earth, what were cruel men in comparison?

Either way, fantasizing about a life other than the one she was in the middle of trying to survive had yet to do her any good.  It was growing harder and harder to keep her mind sharp and focused in the frigid nighttime air. 

Each RC had miles of area outside of the city limit proper known as barrens where the least privileged amongst the city citizens found themselves scraping by on scraps and Authority kindness.  For what little that was worth. Lavender had already spent half of the day trekking her way through empty white fields and forests full of gnarled and twisted trees devoid of color and life. Not a sign of anything outside of her was to be found.  Well, besides herself and Brute, that is. 

Unable to quite get the hang of tracking, Lavender hadn’t known how lucky she was when shortly after her father’s death Brute appeared.  Sobbing ugly, uncontrollably in the arms of a freshly dug grave, feeling dark; impossibly alone -  in stark contrast to the light and growth of the Vernus landscape – there across the field appeared a large muscular mutt. Every bit of a hundred pounds and reaching four feet from the ground. pools of browns – coppers and onyx for eyes, and a matching thick and matted coat.  There was a deep and angry scar across the dog’s chest that ran vertically and around his side.

She had no way of telling how long the dog had been staring at her, and certainly there was no way to explain why it had a feeling of familiarity to it. Understandably, it was then inexplicable to her that the dog should follow as she – numb – made her way by memory back to the hut she had once shared with her dad. The only kindness Authority had to offer was putting him in the ground, free of charge. Once she had arrived she became aware that her stomach was growling.  It wasn’t until the dog had returned she even realized he had gone.  In his mouth, splattered red with blood, was an albino rabbit. Lavender was grateful to have a meal to make, even if he had clearly been a brute to get it.  The name stuck. Having a companion after her father was gone helped keep the worst of the loneliness at bay, but even the fact that Brute had yet to waive from her side for even a moment was not always of comfort.

*“Remember, Lav, they can’t take what’s in your heart.  I’ll always be there,”* that’s what he used to say. He said it even more once they knew he was sick.  Did all he could to prepare Lavender for the inevitable.

So, one morning while the rest of the ash-ladened landscape struggled in sunlight to become some version of alive, Lavender’s father was cold to the touch and she knew somehow – deep in the now hollow of her belly – that he was not coming back.  As she was trained to do, she contacted the RC3 Authority Magistrate Office and was informed that her requisite 48-hour mourning period had begun. 

It was during this time that those they had been closer with in the barrens came to pay their respects.  Mostly in the form of small dishes and offerings of items that Lav would struggle herself to obtain or scavenge. Batteries, oil, ammo, her first belt to hold her father’s old pistol…she supposed she would need to start thinking of it and the two rifles he had left behind as her own property.  As they could be used in the barrens for hunting – and therefore self-sustainment – they were of the precious few items that did not revert to the hands of Authority upon death.  Thankfully, they still passed to next of kin.

As far as popularity went, Lav and her father had done well enough to keep food on the table consistently and Lav in clothing that didn’t have moth holes and reek of the dirt in the streets. Being likable mattered in a world where resources were more limited than the population.  If the elders at the Script Institute were to be believed over their lunchtime coffees that’s how things have always been and likely how things are always doomed to be. All it really meant was that it didn’t hurt to be someone that people *wanted* to do business with.  Found likable. Lavender had discovered in the years since he had passed that she had to work at what came to her father naturally.  He had an ease with which he conversed, and the guns were like extensions of his very being in his hands. She could not claim the same.

Her appearance had never helped.  To be sure, her skin was fair enough, and her features plain if not pretty.  Her hair hung in loose waves that grazed her shoulders and matched the snowy grey of the ash that always blanketed everything in sight. Still, people were always taken aback by Lavender, especially when she made eye contact.  For even though they were light in color and reflection, one eye was a distinct green while the other an unmistakable purple.  In a world where most people all shared the same dull coloring as a side effect of radiation exposure, more people than not found the sight of her brightly colored irises too be…unsettling. It had inspired her name, though, and for that she was partial to them.

Shooting was another story altogether.  She took to handling the guns like a fish takes to flight. By the time her dad had passed, Lavender could at least manage the recoils and aim fairly straight.  She still occasionally double tapped; but now it was only when she felt nervous about a potential kill; ones she needed to fend off starvation and bitter Hiemal nights – like tonight.

She was certain that Brute had picked up the scent of *something*, and she let out a low, long whistle as their signal for him to reveal himself and the trail he was on. He had to.  The alternative meant another night in the freezing cold with stomachs that were somehow less than empty.  Food sources had been scarce this season – more scarce than times past. Hence the necessity of travelling over a mile farther than usual in the hopes of finding any wild game. If anything at all – pheasants, rabbits, wolves, deer – wasn’t hunkering down to hibernate or hide, Brute would know, and Lav would kill and clean it.

Squinting into the dark, small pools of tears gathered at the corners of her eyes and froze almost as fast as her breath in her chest. Just before she can imagine all the worst scenarios as to why she didn’t spy Brute yet, his large form came into vision. In his mouth, Lavender could make out the outline of a turkey.  Brute lucked himself into a colony sleeping up in the tree husks.

The closer that he got to where she waited, the easier it became to see the lack of blood on the bird. There was an angle of wrongness to its neck and wings.

“Startled out of the tree to death, huh, Brute? It’s about time fortune smiled on u..uss” the last of her words coming with a strain against the cold and tired that was quickly threatening to overtake her.

“C’mon.  Let’s go home”

Brute made no sign of reply except to silently follow behind Lavender, carrying the first meal they’d had in days, as they made their way back to the hut in the barrens.",1,1766687424.0,PatreonSpace,0,1.0,False

I look in the mirror now. And I do love the person I see. I’m happy with how I view the world now.  
I’m not where I want to be yet. But I’m where I need to be so that one day I’ll get there.

That matters to me so much.

I came into 2025 not knowing what it would bring. Things were grim.  
I came in being told to temper my expectations.   
So I wrote a book. I self-published it. And I haven’t looked back.  
Roughly 40,000 words. Give or take.

Very short book.  
Very dense book.

It’s a look into my mind. And how I made sense of the unthinkable.  
We all have versions of what is unthinkable.  
The word is unfathomable by nature.

This book is what my unthinkable looks like.  
And I don’t need to look back. I know it’ll be there when I’m ready.

I’m left wondering now.  
I’ve begun the foundation. What comes next?  
I’ve never gone into a New Year feeling hopeful. Not for as long as I can remember.  
How can my goals reflect that growth?

My instincts; I’m craving connection. 

Find my person.

But I don’t think it’s time for that yet.  
I haven’t even dedicated a full year to finding myself.  
I can’t even contemplate dedicating time toward finding my person, and yet it pulls at me.  
I let it. And I move on.

You don’t put the roof on while you’re still setting the foundation.  
Maybe the roof comes along, maybe it stands on the sidewalk,  
Sending heart-wrenching catcalls from afar, support at a distance,  
Until the time is right.  
That could happen.

I’ve lived far more unthinkable things.

Career is the next thought.  
That’s been the plan all along, 

2025.. get my mind right.  
2026.. Money.

That’s it.  
I didn’t define it any more than that.

Now I’m here. Days away from beginning my next goal, and I don’t even know what it means.

I didn’t finish University. I don’t have a degree.  
I don’t even know how I graduated high school.  
I’m not dumb. I’m emotionally regarded. (You could substitute a T in there, I thought it too.)  
I certainly didn’t keep up with everyone socially. I struggle with boundaries.

So I started writing.   
To try and frame my own boundaries, put a frame on my thoughts per se.  
I accomplished that this year. I don’t view the world the same anymore.  
And I couldn’t be more grateful.

I look back on who I was just 9 months ago, the journal entries, the sadness, the hopelessness.   
I’m still shocked that person survived.   
But he did, and the goal can’t just be ‘money.’

I’m not dumb. But that’s dumb.  
I’m not just going to return to a mindless job, making enough to survive, maybe put a bit of money away. I can’t do that.

The person I would become if I took that path, he wouldn’t survive.  
I’ve lived unthinkable experiences, it can’t have been for that.

**~~Money~~**  
Off the list. Backseat driver now.

What’s next?  
I love the mind I can see when I look in the mirror, I don’t yet love the body.   
It’s not awful, really, I just hate myself more than I’ve ever loved myself.

Rewriting that story requires a long recovery.  
What if 2025, was for the Mind.  
What if 2026, is for the Body.

This year, I’ve grown tremendously. But one thing I’ve learned,  
Always thought I lacked this skill,  
But I can be very disciplined.  
I just have to navigate my boundaries efficiently.  
Maybe it takes more conscious effort than the average joe.  
But I can do it, I’ve done it.  
What has always stopped me from really taking my body seriously, is discipline.

I’ve never not been able to feed my emotions, either through starvation and purging, or over-indulging and gluttony.   
My weight has fluctuated large numbers over the years.

What if I stabilize that, now that I’ve established a foundation for navigating my emotions.  
What if 2025 was about loving the person on the inside.  
And 2026 is about loving what is on the outside.

What is a feasible goal, for a one year timeframe?  
I don’t have a large source of income, but I do have time.  
What could I do with that time?  
I’m going to sit with this. I have 6 days before the New Year.  
I think I’d like to get in shape for 2026.

I sat down with my coffee, and my goal was to come up with what my over-arching goal for 2026 would be. I’ve achieved that.

2026 is about living in my body with the same care I’ve learned to give my mind.",2,1766687338.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.67,False

Below is an article on why we should keep christmas free of sports.

The lights come up. The jingle plays. A commentator booms about “a Christmas treat for fans everywhere.” Somewhere behind the camera, a player kisses their children goodbye before driving to a stadium that smells of disinfectant and stale coffee, not pine needles and roast potatoes. This, we are told, is festive.
Sport on Christmas Day has become so normalised that questioning it can feel like heresy. The NBA has turned the 25th of December into a marquee television event. The NFL now treats it as another square on the calendar, even when it falls midweek. Broadcasters frame it as a gift to the public, a benevolent offering of drama and distraction. But strip away the tinsel and the rhetoric, and a harder truth emerges: sport has no place being played on Christmas Day, because Christmas is not just another broadcast window. It is a cultural and human exception, and we erode it at our peril.
The case for Christmas sport is usually made in the language of demand. People watch, therefore games should be played. The figures are impressive. NBA Christmas Day games have averaged around five million viewers per match in recent seasons, numbers the league proudly promotes. When the NFL scheduled games on Christmas Day in 2022 and 2023, audiences reached into the tens of millions, outperforming almost everything else on television that week. These are real, verifiable statistics, and they matter to advertisers and executives.

But popularity is not the same as legitimacy. Plenty of things would draw enormous audiences if we scheduled them on Christmas Day. A general election. A reality TV finale. A live broadcast from a factory floor. The fact that something can command attention does not mean it should. Christmas has historically been one of the few days when society collectively agrees to pause. In the UK, large shops are still legally required to close on Christmas Day. Public transport is drastically reduced. Even in an increasingly secular country, the day retains a shared meaning that goes beyond consumption. Sport barging in with broadcast trucks and sponsorship activations feels less like generosity and more like encroachment.

A defence is tradition. The NBA has played on Christmas Day since 1947, supporters note, as if longevity alone confers moral authority. Yet tradition cuts both ways. English football once played fixtures on Christmas Day, but abandoned the practice in the early 20th century because players and fans alike resented it. What survived instead was Boxing Day football, a compromise that respected Christmas itself. The “tradition” we should be defending, then, is not constant play, but the idea that at least one day should be off-limits.

Then there is the argument that athletes are compensated handsomely and know what they sign up for. This is the most common counterargument, and on the surface it is persuasive. NBA and NFL players earn salaries most people can only dream of. Why should they be exempt from working on Christmas when doctors, carers and emergency workers do so every year?

The response is simple and uncomfortable. Doctors and emergency workers provide essential services. Sport does not. The comparison flatters leagues but collapses under scrutiny. Moreover, high pay does not erase human cost.

When the NFL expanded its holiday schedule, the NFL Players Association publicly warned about the strain of an increasingly compressed calendar. JJ Watt, one of the league’s most recognisable figures, wrote in 2020 that players “miss kids opening presents, family traditions, all of it,” urging fans to acknowledge that sacrifice rather than romanticise it. That sentiment is echoed quietly across locker rooms every December.

And the athletes are only the most visible workers involved. A Christmas Day game mobilises tens of thousands of others: stadium staff, stewards, medics, cleaners, caterers, drivers, camera operators and production crews. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, leisure and hospitality is one of the sectors most likely to require holiday work, and sport sits squarely within it. Every Christmas kickoff normalises the idea that this day, too, should be surrendered to the market. It tells workers lower down the pay scale that opting out is not really an option.

There is also a cultural argument in favour of Christmas sport that deserves to be taken seriously. For some people, Christmas is lonely, painful or empty. A live game, the counterargument goes, offers comfort and community. For fans without family nearby, sport can be a lifeline, a familiar presence on a difficult day.

This is perhaps the strongest case of all. But it does not follow that live, newly played sport must be the answer. Recorded matches, classic games, documentaries and analysis could provide the same companionship without requiring an entire industry to work on the day itself. The BBC has long understood this balance, filling Christmas schedules with archive programmes and shared rituals rather than live production at all costs. Comfort does not have to mean exploitation.
The pandemic years stripped away many of the comforting myths around sport. Empty stadiums revealed how dependent the spectacle is on unseen labour. When leagues pushed ahead with Christmas games during Covid-19 surges, the contrast was jarring: families were told to limit gatherings, while teams travelled, trained and played because television contracts demanded it. The message was clear enough. Even this day is negotiable when enough money is at stake.

There is also something quietly lost when sport occupies Christmas. It is one of the few days when even the most committed fans might once have been forced to step away, to talk to relatives, to be bored, to sit with silence. The Guardian has often argued that sport matters because it reflects society. On Christmas Day, society should reflect something other than relentless competition and productivity.

None of this is an argument against sport itself. Sport is joyous, communal and often profound. That is precisely why it should not be reduced to background noise for a day that already carries emotional weight for so many. Let sport rest, and it will not be diminished. If anything, its absence would remind us of its value.

The final defence is usually a shrug: if you don’t like it, don’t watch. But Christmas is not just an individual consumer choice. It is a shared social contract. Once we accept that even this day can be fully colonised by live sport, there is nothing left to protect. The calendar becomes a grid of monetisable slots, and human needs are expected to fit around it.
So imagine, just for a moment, a Christmas Day without tip-offs or kickoffs. Stadium lights dark. Players at home. Broadcasters filling the silence with memories rather than demands. It would feel strange at first. Then it might feel right. Because some days are meant to be kept, not sold. And if we cannot draw the line on Christmas Day, we should stop pretending that sport is anything more than another business, happy to play on while the rest of the world is supposed to be at peace.

Finally got everything set up, bought my first bag of beans, and proceeded to burn through about half the bag + too many hours of “research” (aka reading tons of post and losing screenshots in my phones album  pretending I understand pressure profiling) before getting something that wasn’t pure sadness in liquid form.

I was just sold on zero electronics to break in a few years and then getting lost in trying to fix on my own (I dont have the best skill set for that) , buy a new machine or pay someone to repair.

And honestly… espresso tonics are elite beginner drinks because you can absolutely butcher the shot and tonic water is like: “Don’t worry bro, I got you.” Add a little flavoring and suddenly I’m a craft beverage visionary instead of a dude fighting physics.

   2. Renown - Allies and enemies quickly learn what I'm capable of - The benefactor said we should feel free to let loose in this jump so I'm going to be well known anyway
   3. The Draft x2 - start in the middle of the war, where healers are in demand - big points for being in the middle of the action
   4. Longer Stay x1 - stay an extra 5 years - so that I could get an even multiple of points
2. Common Picks - things we're all taking because they're free to all or too good to pass up
   1. Medic Training - basic first aid - free for everyone
   2. Medical Kit - daily-replenishing container of bandages, gauze, sutures, disinfectants, etc - free and updates in other settings
   3. A Place in the World - paperwork to fit into the setting and some knowledge of its history - free but minimal
3. Perks - largely focusing on creating new life
   1. Medic Training: Doctor of Emergency Medicine - expansion of the freebie, with credentialing - expands non-fiat-backed doctor knowledge from past jumps plus serves as a hook to be wherever I need to be
   2. Protected Soul - protects against soul attacks, possessions, and subversion of will - possibly redundant but valuable for what's coming
   3. Anatomical Expertise - anatomy beyond humans, in depth - valuable for artificial life
   4. Exorcist - Observe a person's soul, recognize and diagnose spiritual injuries (corruption, curses, possession) - foray into soul work for creating life
   5. Spellcaster (Golemancy) - impart a pseudo-mind into objects, eventually create full persistent minds - mental aspect of creating artificial life
   6. Cure the Incurable - Nothing is incurable, and skills always keep growing as long as you push yourself - Conceptual heft to healing and a limit remover
   7. Time Heals All Wounds - ageless, resist disease and poison, resist soul-killing and existing erasing effects, healing factor - all somewhat redundant, but good to compound
   8. Biotechnician - flesh shaping, starting with virii and bacteria but working up to elaborate biotech - the main physical aspect of creating artificial life
   9. Nature of the Soul - Understand the soul, astral project, interact with souls, use souls, start development of souls - The rest of soul work for creating life
   10. Miracle Worker - Use energy to prevent someone on the cusp from dying, gain motes for occasional healing power boosts or resurrections, gain accumulating 1-ups
4. Items
   1. Pick Your Poison - replenishing supply of medicines and drugs plus toxins and diseases, can add items to make them replenish too - pairs well with my toxin control / Herbalist perks from Generic Classical Elements and life manipulation
   2. Rod of Asclepius - Can give others Healer abilities, or spread them around a setting
5. Companions - Bringing 3 who will benefit
   1. Nosogi Ren - this jump was her request, and she already has quite extensive healing and alchemical abilities
      1. Psychopomp - see spirits of the dead, guide them to the afterlife for a token, or help those with unfinished business for a boon - Ren is already a valkyrie, so she may as well collect benefit from this responsibility
	   2. Biotechnician - Ren wants to learn to go from toxins to diseases, and this is that pathway
	   3. This is a Place of Healing - define a volume of space that improves medicine and healing within and inhibits violence or aggression - an additional bonus to layer on a broad category of what Ren does, plus an additional layer of protection, this is great for her
	   4. Nature of the Soul - As someone who already treats mental illnesses and deals with spirits of the dead, souls of the living is completing the frontier of healing for Ren
	   5. Healing Church - a place that connects to an entity aligned with healing that can accept offerings and grant blessings - Those helped by Ren often want to offer something in return and this is a way she can accept and channel those offerings into something useful
	   6. Apothecary's Magnum Opus - 1/jump vial that can absorb medicines, enhance them, and make the effects permanent on the drinker - a complicated and expensive way for Ren to give out permanent buffs
   2. Boudicca - Already a very powerful druid, telekinetic, and martial master, Boudicca was specifically interested in healing and asked to be imported into this jump in particular, and then found options to synergize with her Swarm druid specialization
	   1. Physiotherapy - know how far you can push someone and the limits of doing harm / doing good - great for healing and recovery as well as Boudicca's pasttime of combat training
	   2. Protected Soul - Boudicca is a defensive powerhouse, and is eager for more layers of protection
	   3. Verinarian - able to treat any flesh and blood creature as well as you can a human - great for druid minions, and for what this jump has in store
	   4. Combat Medic - your combat skill and medicine skill are linked so raising one raises the other - Boudicca is a martial specialist so this makes her an instant medical genius
	   5. Lay on Hands - regenerating pool of energy to heal damage with a touch, scaling with practice and medical knowledge, gains additional options with experience - a paladin classic for our defensive powerhouse makes sense
	   6. Share the Burden - touch someone to take on some of their pain, fatigue, or symptoms - Boudicca can withstand much more than an average human
	   7. Time Heals All Wounds - not so redundant for Boudicca, and another powerful defensive perk for her
	   8. Web of Life - form a ""network"" of connections with other creatures where healing to one can affect the others, starting small and short-ranged but growing with practice, combo effects with Share the Burden - extreme synergy with Swarm Druid techniques, plus great synergy with Share the Burden, Lay On Hands, and Time Heals All Wounds to really make Boudicca a great group defender
	   9. Universal Antidote - applies to any poison or toxin but can be overwhelmed by quantity - Boudicca wants this handy with two toxin manipulators in the group
   3. Azula - joining for this whole series, but she has a special relationship with Ren, and she's continuing her angle toward machine and technology perks
	   1. Psychologist - Diagnose and treat mental illnesses even if curing is impossible - Azula wants to help others like Ren helped her
	   2. Combat Medic - Azula is also highly adept with martial arts and combat skills, so now she's a highly adept physician
	   3. Medical Engineering - knowledge to make diagnostic tools and medical devices, with possibility to eventually learn to make medical nanomachines, also skill with reverse engineering and huge intelligence boost - three perks in one, and well aligned with Azula's goals
	   4. Repairman - skills for diagnosis and healing can be applied to machines as well, links mechanical and medical skills, bonus for biomechanical beings, applies to software as well thanks to Psychologist - another thing effective combination for Azula, and the software option is a major benefit
	   5. Spellcaster (Technomancy) - use magic to interact with and augment technology, hack machines, etc - great for a gearhead, and gives Azula a unique angle within this group
	   6. Portable Medbay - Clinic and triage center that can pack up or change shape - Azula also likes vehicles and this can be one, plus it's an option for her to help at a larger scale
	   7. Prosthetics x3 - Collection of prosthetics that always has a good match, includes organs and cybernetics that integrate easily and can be better than baseline flesh and blood - good for a tech setting where magic regeneration might stick out, or a magic setting where technomancy might make these even better
	   

## Jump Notes
1. When Boudicca, Kai, Anko, Azula, and I return to the warehouse following the twilight of the Tuatha De Danann, we are immediately greeted by J-Borg, informing me of another note requesting me to visit the Benefactor's lounge.
   1. I enter the room, noting that the ""calendar"" tracking our jumps now shows the last one as complete, and simply lists the next as ""?? 46: Generic Healer ??"", which is a bit disconcerting
      1. No agent comes out to chat with me, but a note on the coffee table congratulates me on the combat automaton I created in the last jump, and says that even though they won't spoil what the next jump destination is, they think I'll appreciate it, and the opportunity to let loose a bit within it
      2. That sounds ominous to me, but with no other clues in sight, I take the note and head back to meet with the others
   2. The usual post-jump celebration kicks off as usual, with a wide variety of food and a lot of awkward questions about why we rolled over for the Milesians
      1. Without knowing the nature of the next jump well enough to use it as a distraction, we simply say that Boudicca found it important to follow the prophecies of the lore
      2. Still, the jubilant atmosphere wins out, and everyone is happy to have us back and undistracted, if only for a week
   3. When the topic of the next jump comes up, Ren and I have to explain that we really have no idea what's coming
      1. We know that there will be healing perks and items, and healing will be relevant in the jump, but not where we will be going, or what it will be like
	   2. We still have our usual strategy meeting, talking about what it would look like if we take the Benefactor's note at face value and ""let loose""
	      1. We have a wide variety of abilities, and without knowing what we'll pick up in this jump it's hard to speculate
		   2. It puts us on edge imagining what sorts of threats the Benefactor is planning to throw at us that might require us to let loose, however
   4. As the timer in our warehouse ticks down the moments until the jump begins, the four of us arrange ourselves in a defensive formation, ready to act at the moment of arrival...
2. With a flash and a slight twist of the stomach, we arrive in-jump in our defensive stances, standing in an empty gravel lot beside a long, high-tech medical support bus
   1. With no immediate danger visible, we take a moment to compare notes and get our bearings
      1. The air is cool and still, the horizon just starting to brighten with sunrise, and our bodies feel slightly off from waking up earlier than usual
      2. Our briefing says we are a contracted humanitarian response team deployed to help stabilize the fallout from a border incident where Paraguayan forces used advanced military equipment on loan from the US to strike into Bolivian territory; the North American Military Alliance (NAMA) is funding aid missions in Bolivia to reduce tensions and save face
      3. It is 4:19 AM on December 21, we're in Cochabamba, Bolivia, and we are parked beside a municipal water purification plant; we're scheduled to meet our local contacts in Robore tomorrow before heading toward the affected villages
      4. The bus behind us is a well-equipped mobile clinic that was provided by NAMA and the situation seems straightforward, though the Benefactor's earlier note leaves us unsure what challenges are coming
   2. We also compare the personal details of our in-world identities
      1. I am the crew chief, a veteran emergency medicine practitioner, and the lead surgeon for this deployment
      2. Ren is second in command, a seasoned therapist focused on trauma and PTSD, and will serve as our liaison for local coordination
      3. Azula is an expert in prosthetics and medical implants, responsible for both technical and medical support, and will also handle our equipment and mechanical needs
      4. Boudicca is a combat veteran turned physical therapist, assigned to work with patients recovering from injuries or adapting to prosthetics, and is also responsible for managing our team's security
   3. As the sun rises, I begin driving east, and a quick adjustment gives me draconic eyes, neutralizing the difficulty of driving straight into the sun
      1. The long daylight gives us a lot of driving time, and we're halfway between Santa Cruz and Robore before we park for the night
	   2. We do have to pass through several military checkpoints along the way, as tensions have apparently been ramping up again in light of failed UN resolutions
   4. Just before midnight, with Ren and Azula already asleep, I feel a premonition through my danger sense: blinding light and an unfamiliar sort of danger
      1. Without knowing more, I react quickly, first warning Boudicca and asking her if she can telekinetically muffle outside sounds, and then I flood the interior of the bus with inky black shadow to guard against the light
	   2. When the flash hits a moment later, I can feel it, but it's not strong enough to burn away my shadows, let alone blind any of us
	   3. In the minutes that follow, we see a low glow in the direction of Robore, and a mushroom cloud forming over it, followed by a low rumble like thunder and a shaking of the ground and trees as the shockwave reaches us
	   4. A few minutes later, another blinding flash from the direction of Santa Cruz, and then another from roughly the same direction but slightly farther away, no doubt La Paz, but we are prepared, at least physically
	   5. Then, a few minutes later still, more flashes from the southeast as the Bolivian retaliatory strikes land in Paraguay
	   6. It's clear that this humanitarian mission won't go as planned, but the radio on our bus is fried and the air is thick with radioactive particles, so we slip into the warehouse to discuss the situation
	   7. When we emerge from the warehouse a little over an hour later, having discussed the situation and our intended response, we quickly realize that our planning was for naught
	      1. Something has changed drastically...
		   2. There's magic in the air, and Ren can feel millions of souls working their way to the afterlife in the surrounding area
		   3. And suddenly, I realize just where and when our Benefactor has sent us...
3. The situation is going to get worse before it gets better, and it probably won't get noticeably better while we're in this world
   1. I explain the situation, as much as I understand it, to the team
      1. Unfortunately, we don't seem to have any relevant media, even in the warehouse, so our source of information is whatever spotty bits I read twenty or more years prior to my first jump
      2. Ren, sensing what she describes as a stormcloud of souls in the sky forming over Santa Cruz, insists we head back in that direction and help as many survivors there as we can
	   3. Boudicca drives while Ren and Azula use their abilities to repair any of the damaged equipment on board and I work at a spell circle to stave off the harmful effects of ionizing radiation
   2. The drive back to Santa Cruz is quiet and tense, with the skyline lit only by the faint glow of distant fires and the pale blue shimmer of the ley line storm gathering above it
      1. As we crest a hill on the outskirts, we can see that the heart of the city is gone; the center is a crater surrounded by blocks of shattered concrete and melted metal, with no movement and no signs of life
      2. Outside the core, however, we find small clusters of survivors who had been far enough from the blast to live through it, most of them burned, dehydrated, and terrified
      3. Our bus is the only working vehicle in sight, and we adopt a simple cover story that it was hardened against EMP as part of a previous NAMA project and that we were far enough from the initial strike to avoid major damage
      4. Ren begins guiding restless souls to the afterlife while the rest of us take stock of the physical situation
   3. We spend the next few days canvassing the outskirts of Santa Cruz, gathering survivors and doing what we can for them while avoiding revealing too much
      1. We distribute iodine tablets from our bulk stores in the Warehouse (picked up in Fallout) to anyone who will take them, and for the worst cases, Ren uses her limited supplies of Rad-X, which Boudicca extends by subtly setting up ""prayer circles"" for the afflicted and using Web of Life on them
      2. I efficiently treat burns, fractures, and acute trauma as discreetly as possible, with Azula providing occasional prosthetics, both of us downplaying our efforts to maintain the illusion of simply being skilled physicians
      3. Ren becomes more withdrawn as she focuses on her Psychopomp duties, and it seems like the more restless souls she guides, the more souls from the surrounding area seem drawn to her
         1. She starts slipping away at night to guide the dead so they do not get lost in the storms that come and go above the city
         2. After two nights of this, she admits that her human guise is insufficient for the sheer volume of death, and seeks out abandoned but spiritually rich areas to change into her Valkyrie form, which is well-suited to sifting through and guiding souls of the departed en mases
         3. Unfortunately, a few groups of opportunistic survivors (looters) spot her at work while her focus is with the dead, and soon rumors spread: some say an angel of mercy is tending to the lost, while others mention a monster desecrating shrines and snatching up souls
   4. With thousands of people gathering around our bus and makeshift aid station, we begin the slow journey northeast, out of the path of likely fallout   
      1. Azula organizes the civilians into a walking caravan and establishes roles for the healthier survivors, such as ensuring no one gets in the way of the bus and keeping an eye out for troublemakers
      2. Boudicca leadss foraging parties along the route, which somehow always manage to find fresh fruits and vegetables in at least some quantity, though not enough to sustain this caravan for long 
      3. At night we distribute milk to those accompanying us, the one thing I can supply in sufficient amounts; we claim it's a special emergency relief formulation of powdered milk NAMA sent with us
	   4. Ren continues tending to the souls that now swarm around her night and day, invisible to the living survivors that similarly crowd around us
      5. She tolerates me pulling her away from her duties long enough to help me identify trustworthy and strong-minded individuals in the crowd, and from the 25,000 or so traveling with us, we soon gather a small inner circle of about a dozen
	      1. We explain to these trusted few that their troubles are only just beginning
		   2. And we offer them no relief, only more responsibility: I allow each of them to touch the Rod of Asclepius and become a healer, hoping that they will be able to do something for their countrymen
   5. Over the next few days, as our massive caravan follow the highway northeast, the signs of the cataclysm become unmistakeable and unavoidable
      1. Massive lines of blue light are now visible in the night sky, seeming to grow more intense with each passing night
	   2. After three days of walking, we have our first encounter with actual rift creatures: a squad of aggressive psi-sensitive bat-like demihumans that seem drawn to us specifically, but are easily dispatched
	      1. The survivors, already traumatized by the nuclear attack on their city, are shocked to see the demihumans, but otherwise hardly affected
	   2. The number and intensity of ill-behaved spirits drawn to Ren continues to rise; though she can deal with them, she soon asks for assistance as the ghosts of various sorts distract her from helping those who actually want to move on
	     1. When some of the spirits begin possessing the survivors following us, we realize that our presence here is starting to do more harm than good
		  2. At least one of the possession victims realizes they have developed psi powers after the spirit is exorcised, and soon others do as well
      3. By the third week of the caravan, rumors about us have spread far beyond our direct influence, ranging from claims that we are government agents to gods to monsters, none of which help the situation
   6. After three weeks of escating effects, we announce that we will have to depart
      1. The occasional aggressive spirits and monsters are hardly a threat to us, but they come in numbers, and from any directions, causing casualties even before we can find them
	   2. Our strong psychic presences keep drawing them in, like moths to a flame
	   3. So we do what we can to help get these people set up - Boudicca spends time cultivating a fertile area for them in a valley far from any ley lines, and we share a small cache of enchanted ammunition with the ones who have proven themselves as caravan guards before we drive off
	   4. Many try to follow us, or blame us for problems as we leave, but we clearly cannot stay with these people indefinitely
4. Once we have put enough distance between ourselves and the Bolivian refugees, I open the way to our next destination through the roots of my world-tree
   1. We have been discussing where to focus our efforts since the apocalypse began
      1. Given our abilities and the Benefactor’s suggestion to let loose, we choose the place where small-scale but high-intensity combat will do the greatest good: St. Louis, the site of the Gateway Nexus
         1. Ren is uneasy about leaving behind the restless souls in Bolivia, but even she admits the Sisyphean work was wearing her down, and that we will be more effective where the fighting is focused and the need is acute
      2. Opening a portal to St. Louis feels strange; it is like the whole region is pulling on the spell, eager to draw anything magical toward itself
      3. As we step through, the blue glow of surrounding ley lines lights the ground like an eerie dawn, and rifts blink in and out near the horizon
         1. We arrive atop a hill of ash on the east bank of the Mississippi, with the burning ruins of St. Louis sprawled across the river
         2. The land around us is buried under drifting dunes of volcanic ash, and the tallest buildings are cracked, warped, or collapsed entirely, some burning with colors that do not belong to fire
         3. The river has swallowed its banks and become a wide, unstable slurry of ash, mud, boiling water, and plates of ice that form and melt without pattern
   2. Our presence is quickly noticed by the first of many hostile groups
      1. A band of large, orange-skinned humanoids tries to stalk us from the southwest, but to me their approach is obvious
      2. Their leader, nearly ten feet tall, hurls a massive spear at Ren while her attention is elsewhere
         1. Boudicca telekinetically catches the spear mid-flight with a sharp gesture and we move to engage
      3. Perhaps out of habit, or overconfidence after the last few weeks, we hold back instead of opening with full force
         1. I let their leader strike me without using every defense; his fist punches straight through my chest, painful but brief, and the look on his face when my scattered insides reassemble themselves is worth it
         2. While he hesitates, I counterattack with the simplest weapon I own: a viking club; it bounces harmlessly off his hide, so I follow with my 1911 loaded with blessed silver, which at least leaves shallow burns
         3. Boudicca matches me beat for beat, using the opening to test her telekinetic layers until she can halt their blows at the edge of her skin, appearing completely invulnerable
         4. Ren, worn down and stretched thin from weeks of work, sends a thick cloud of poisons into the enemy backline; they collapse in seconds, and she gives me a guilty shrug for not restraining herself
         5. Azula experiments in the opposite direction, starting with weak fire and lightning as she probes one skirmisher, only committing once the rest of the fight winds down
            1. When her target is the last one left, she sighs, grows bored, and incinerates him with a clean burst of fire
      4. The pillar of flame from Azula's finishing blow draws attention, but the nearby demons and demihumans seem more curious than bold
   3. Over the next three weeks, we attempt to locate survivors and secure them, but the Gateway is a constant battleground
      1. Nearly every original resident of the St. Louis area has died or fled, but rifts continually deposit new displaced people into the region
         1. The first group is impossible to miss: half of a large sailing ship embedded in a muddy pond, with a dozen US Navy sailors hiding inside alongside twice as many dead
            1. We give what aid we can and learn that their ship, the USS Pickering, was torn apart in a strange storm; they believe it is still the year 1800 until we explain the situation, which does not improve their shock
         2. The second group is even more disoriented: seven adolescents clad in deer hides
            1. With a combination of a Tongues spell and telepathy, we determine that they are pre-colonial Plains Indians who were separated from their tribe during a coming-of-age ritual
         3. Once we refine our search method, we find more displaced people, confused locals who foolishly moved toward the city, and occasional harmless demihumans
      2. Every day brings attacks from dozens of directions, often simultaneously
         1. Rifts open with a sound like tearing fabric, dropping demons, beasts, or panicked civilians into our vicinity
         2. Ghosts and spirits drift across the ruined streets, some confused and passive, others aggressive or maddened by the ambient magic; wreaking havoc until Ren can quiet them for good
         3. Elementals surge along the ley line storm fronts and lash out at anything nearby
         4. Raiding parties of all sorts of monsters, humanoid and otherwise, sweep over the dunes regularly
      3. We fight constantly, sometimes with an hour or so between skirmishes, sometimes for whole stretches of the day
         1. Each of us try a variety of different tactics, before eventually settling on whatever we find most efficient as we simply try to end conflicts as quickly as possible
      4. Despite the constant pressure, we gather and stabilize several hundred survivors across the weeks
         1. We establish temporary safe zones in collapsed underpasses, shielded ruins, and well-practiced warding schemes
         2. With a bit of luck and effort, we scrounge up some generators and radio systems for the survivors to use
   4. Once again, and without intending to, we end up responsible for a growing number of helpless people who need to get far away from the city, but the ashfall makes forming a walking caravan impossible
      1. After weighing our options, we decide to actually ""let loose"" and travel efficiently, so I summon the flying island of Laputa from the warehouse
         1. Its arrival draws immediate attention, and soon gargoyles and other flying beasts swarm around it
         2. I see little point in subtlety anymore, so I conjure a massive rainstorm around the island; the falling water mixes with ash into sheets of mud and carries my curse of pride, forcing anything caught in it to fixate on me while Azula pilots it
         3. As the gargoyles converge, I intensify the storm with lightning, blasting clusters out of the air while cutting others down with my axe until the sky is mostly clear
      2. Ground-based demons and monsters rush us as well, but Boudicca and Ren keep the survivors safe while I carve through the attackers with waterbending, radiant magic, and rapid strikes
      3. Once everyone is aboard Laputa, Azula relieves me so she can take her turn on defense
         1. She has wanted a real chance to cut loose, and escorting the flying island gives her the opportunity
         2. As we ascend, she shifts into her massive draconic form, rising alongside the island like a living storm of fire and wings
   5. We make our way northeast toward Chicago on Laputa, with curious gargoyles and other creatures trailing at a respectful distance but rarely daring to approach the floating fortress and its dragon guardian
      1. Those that do approach are promptly destroyed by Azula's soul-burning dragonfire",1,1766686900.0,u_AxstromVinoven,0,1.0,False

I love rain tapping against the window while I’m lying still at night, when the world fades and the moonlight pours through the glass and rests on my face like it knows me. 

I love cold, crisp mornings that make me feel awake and honest. I love watching leaves fall in autumn, how nothing clings when it knows it’s time.

I love dried flowers, not because they’re perfect, but because they’ve lived. 

I love hiking until my feet ache and my legs burn, because the view is always worth it. I love standing still at the top, lungs full, heart racing, knowing I earned the beauty in front of me.

I love looking at the stars and thinking about the people who came before us, how they stood somewhere like this, looking up, wondering what it all meant.

I love keeping movie tickets, holding on to old cards and letters, proof that moments once mattered and still do. 

I love opening old books and breathing in their pages, like memory has a scent. 

I love buying a used book and finding dog-eared pages, pausing there, rereading the same passage over and over, trying to imagine why a previous reader felt compelled to mark that moment. I like imagining what they were feeling, what they recognized, what stayed with them.

I love sitting beneath a tree with a book, quiet and rooted, asking nothing of anyone.

I love coffee—cups and cups of it, endlessly. 

I love r&b at night, when the edges of the day blur and everything slows into something intimate. 

I love my solitude, not as an absence, but as a presence. It is where I hear myself most clearly.

I love a slow-burn kind of love. 

Something patient, earned. Something that grows like embers, not explosions. I want soothing. I want warmth. I want a fireplace, not fireworks.",1,1766686872.0,u_Whiskey_711,0,1.0,False

Anyone want to do some hiking or biking?","Caucasian DL Bi MWM, 6'2"" 230lb, 7"" cut, ISO someone similar for a 'Friend With Benefits(FWB)' type friendship. (age is not important)

Like most guys my age, my story isn't that unusual.  
Married , BiSexual, Hetero-Romantic. I'm DL, only out as Bi to a few close friends and i'm not looking to change that. My wife and I are no longer doing it and I'm looking around for a FWB.  
I'm hoping to find someone who might share my interests in music(especially, live music), hiking, mountain biking and camping.

Recently, I've been learning that I'm a sapiosexual.  
Meaning that I'm attracted to someone's intellect and not just how they look. A Good conversation, along with shared experience is what really turns me on.  
I'm not looking for just a hookup. I want to find someone who likes to do more than just sex. Sure, if we click, I'd be down to mess around when we first meet up, but I'd prefer to see if there's really a connection first.

My hair is getting greyer by the day, I could stand to lose a few pounds around the middle (sigh) but all that hiking and riding I do has paid off with well-toned arms and legs. I'm a social drinker and am definitely 420-friendly, but otherwise I'm drug and disease free, I hope I can find someone who is too. Ideally, the right person would be married long-term and interested in being discreet too.

I live in Dublin and work in Redwood City. I'm hoping to find someone nearby, or in-between, who's in a similar situation at home and who might want to get to know each other beyond just getting our rocks off together!

Send me a chat message. I have some pictures to share and hope you do too. Maybe we can connect for coffee, a drink or a hike, maybe more if we click.

  
NOTE: I will delete this post if/when I connect with someone. So if you're seeing this, no matter how long it's be posted, I'm still looking around.

20+ people already using it daily and trusting us with their digital memory.

  
We're CS undergrads. Last week my friend forgot what framework we decided to use for the backend...

So he searched it in Vektori-> boom, every detail. Architectures we tried, bugs we logged  decisions we made. That's when we knew this thing actually works :)

Just some slice of life cuteness.... I'm imagining that you left your hometown to go to college and never really looked back. However. The chubby guy you'd been dating was left alone, heartbroken and in his rut. That's me!

Anyway, ten years later, you're back for Christmas. It's the first time since forever. Literally the first person you see is that guy in a coffee shop. But 30..…and well, 20kg heavier, with muscles on his muscles. Think Terry from Brooklyn 99 muscles. And I'm not working in the Starbucks, I own the business opposite. 

As well as the successful business, the incredible body, fluent in four languages, I'm newly single. 

You barely recognise me when I sends over a coffee. for you. The chat is respectful and fluent. Like you've never left. And you need to see me again. 

Christmas is terrible. Your sister in law is horrible and they have announced their second pregnancy. For the twentieth time she asked when you'll settle down. Then one of the close family members announced that she's got a medical problem. It's all too much. Your phone buzzes.

'So....how's your Christmas? I have to say I'm thankful for having just got these people out of my house. I'm just cleaning up. Do you want to pop round? We never properly caught up. And you looked amazing.'

An hour later, we were in my huge, warm house, laughing about nothing in particular. 

Two hours later, holding hands, discussing our lives to date.

The morning after, intertwined and amending your flight back home so we can spend more time together 

Exactly a year later, it's Christmas again. I smile and look other to my wife and place my hands on your growing tummy. 'Alexis. It's been quite a year....Shall we reminisce?' I am 18+ and all characters and participants must be 18+.

1pvja02,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pvja02/married_couple_always_fighting_and_dragging_me/,Married couple always fighting and dragging me into it.,"So like the title says, I have some really close friends who are married that fight like cats and dogs nonstop. The husband (45M) let's call him Ray has been like a brother to me for many years. He married Tina (40F) about 10 years ago, after being together for 3 years. Tina and I had become friends and almost like sisters. I helped with the wedding and all that. Shortly after their  marriage, her oldest daughter passed away in a horrible car accident. It really effected all of us. Tina still struggles with it still. But then his parents passed about 4 months apart. Hes not one to truly process feelings, he thinks you should just get over it and move on. 

As the years have past I began to notice that more and more I would get a call or text saying Ray said this and he hates me or Tina is acting crazy. Both wanting me to fix whatever the issue is. Both swearing the other is lying and to not listen to them. I dont repeat what they say, I dont take sides, I simply offer advice and suggestions. 

Last night I got a text, Ray hates her, wants her to be a perfect wife, shes too depressed on and on. Then Shortly after I get Ray texting saying how crazy she is, she wont do anything a normal wife does, like cook a meal, didnt go shopping for Christmas dinner. She wont do a load of laundry, or help him get to his diabetic drs, as he did have a foot amputated recently. Both seemed fed up. Both yelling at each other. Both full of way to much drama. And neither one taking responsibility. At this point its midnight, my family wants to do our normal traditional things and since neither truly wanted advice, just wanted me to take sides, I turned my phone off. This morning I get up early to put the turkey on. Make sure the tamales are perfect, iykyk. Get coffee started and  wake up my family (grown kids with spouses) so we can begin our Christmas day. But my phone goes off, they are already fighting. Its way to much. They wont seek counseling. If they do they cant agree on a counselor. They refuse to communicate. Basically as I see it they refuse to try. 

I really feel so done with it all. Part of me wants to cut ties and tell them to figure it out. But Im not sure I can just abandon any friend, much less friends I have for so long. But I have my own life, and responsibilities, and I truly do just feel completely stressed out when they start in.

Vibe Check: Definitely down to meet for a quick 10-minute coffee first to make sure we actually vibe before the drive.
