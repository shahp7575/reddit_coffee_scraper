My electricity is going to be cut off in the morning over $88, I have the rest of it. But they aren‚Äôt willing to work with me. I‚Äôve pawned everything I had left, sold my coffee table, etc. I‚Äôm having medical issues and not able to work now. 

I have a 4 year old and he is so excited for Thanksgiving, he‚Äôs talked about it all week. He‚Äôs more excited about it than Christmas. I‚Äôm terrified if I can‚Äôt find the $88 by the morning we will have no power, no food. He‚Äôs been through so much this year and I just want this day to be special for him. Does anyone know where I could get help with my electric? I‚Äôve tried churches, cac, etc no luck. They are either out of funds or they can‚Äôt get it paid in time for it to get cut off. 

If not, is there any Roo family in Tennessee that would love two people at their thanksgiving, like if anyone is a Friendsgiving? Or I have a fridge full of food that‚Äôs going to go bad if someone would like to cook it or have it and just give my son a plate? Or any local things that are having thanksgiving that I can take him to? 
He‚Äôs just been so excited and our lives have changed a lot since I got sick. I want this day to be good for him. 

Any suggestions welcome, please don‚Äôt judge me!

","The ""one that got away"" reaches out to me 10 years after our break up and three years into her marriage for closure. Is this normal? Why now?

""The one that got away"" began following me a few months back. We broke up 10 years ago shes been married for 3 years now and with that person for almost 9 years. She met him a year or 2 after me so theyve been together a while.

I was young immature and unsure in the world I believe you have to be happy with yourself before youre happy with someone else.

I walked away away to do what I thought was right by both of us at the time. I always wondered if I made the right decision. I dont know if I wouldve grown up if she was there with me. Maybe id be a better man maybe id still be that frustrated insecure kid unsure of everything. It was real though. Im in a better place. Two college degrees etc. We met in high school and dated for years it wasnt the most healthy relationship all the time. Nothing physical but just angry young dumb kid stuff but we were in love.

She started liking my stuff a lot lately and she reached out to me the other day via reply to IG story (I kinda thought she would at some point) and how she was happy to see me doing so well etc. Im a comedian and things have been decent lately. She said she had been talkikg to her friends about messaging me for a month now.

Long story short we text for a day straight. 

We met up (her suggestion) and I apologized for the past etc. Her reason was to get closure which idk I found incredibly odd. Youve been married for years but needed to reach out now? Her husband doesnt know yet she lied to him about where she was going but I she think may tell him in a few weeks? She hasnt decided. We didnt get physical etc like that just walked and talked for two hours.

She asked why I never reached out if I wanted to chat like I claimed and I said she was married and was going to respect her happiness. My sister told me to lay all the cards on the table so I told her how I still felt and was in love and never stopped because I realized this may be the only chance to see her.

 Now I know a lot of you will say in love with the past etc but I'm not I often think of her and my screw ups and always feel like im trying to dig myself out of the hole the younger man did.

She said shes happily married and I said I understand and respect that.
She said she felt bad and I said don't I get it that ships sailed I said I understand I get it. She said at some point shes going to start a family with this person and I told her not to. Not him anways but she assured me out time was done and I said I udnerstood. I think she was taken back by my calm demeanor of accepting her wishes. She said we cant talk anymore or carry any sort of relationship and again I said I understood lol (despite her reaching out to me). Shes still going to follow me on socials etc and I her (I blocked her content so I cant actually see her stuff but sometimes curiosity gets the best of me and I look)

My question for everyone is do you consider this emotional cheating on her part? She may or may not tell her husband down the line. We talked and walked for close to two hours.

And do you believe in closure?

 I personally don't but especially after 10 years no contact. Ive been on her mind and come and go on it but she says it sometimes impacts her relationship to her husband. She named a few random things. Even sex being one of them (I told her she could stop right there I didnt wanna hear that one lol) So again just wondering what peoples thoughts are?

Ill be honest I'm really hoping she messages me but won't hold my breath but again my mind cant help but wonder why now? Especially after so long and three years of marriage to hit me up and do this now? It just feels...so odd and to keep it from her husband just makes me wonder if theres feelings there or not on her part?

I just cant help but think this doesnt feel normal after so long and how great she says her life is (shes doing well for herself) but then why contact me?

I feel like Im gaslighting myself convincing myself this is normal that maybe she needed this healing to het things off her chest and I for her but then the more I think about it. Its been 10 years? Why randomly start this now?

Thoughts would be appreciated!

Update:
 She messaged me this morning saying I know I told you not to reach out but just wanted to say thank you for meeting up with me and how it mustve disrupted my life and that she wanted to leave on better terms and not with me sad or bummed out as I appeared and she was sorry and to take care.

I told her I was okay but thank you and to take care of herself. 

I didnt wanna come off as rude idk if I did but just wanted to keep it short.

Day after that she responds to my story saying she felt bad how we left things and if I was okay I told her I was fine again. She said was nervous seeing me and felt like she blacked out during us meeting and was nervous to see me and felt like neither of us got to get everything off our chest. She said she didnt get to say the things she wanted and just forgot out of nerves. She agreed we had a real love and that she just had the itch to see how I was doing but shouldn't have.

I told her its fine but to do me a favor and not contact me unless she was going through a divorce or seperated. Maybe we can grab a coffee and talk about it but always said I wasnt waiting around and that I was excited to find my person whenever fate allowed it. Someone who deserves and loves me. She said I hope that Id find them and that being loved by someone who makes you happy is a great feeling (like I dont know what love is?) Lol but I just let it go. She said no matter how good her life is or how happy her marriage is that we had good times and she has accepted that Ill come in her mind from time to time because we got to live life together for a time too. We wished me good luck.


Sorry for the novel. I guess I just wanted to get peoples thoughts on it? Is this normal? Like Id like opinions of both sexs honestly?


Im also curious what does this say about the foundation of her marriage with him? Is this a bad sign? She mentioned theyve talked about starting a family together Im just curious as she keeps saying her marriage is so happy (shes got a good poker face so I cant tell lol) but if so happy why even have an inch?

Just frustrated and confused and any and all opinions would be appreciated.

Two tanger outlets in Myrtle.

Parking sucks. This is located in Northern part of Myrtle. Very confusing last mile to get there. Weird loop.

Tanger 501. 80 stores compared to 100. Located on South West part of myrtle. Stores and setup not as nice. Certainly not run down but hwy 17 seems more upscale. Parking good. Navigation on point easy to get around and not as frustrating as hwy 17. It says ""eateries"" but mister coffee is best spot here.

Shepherdess O Eiffel Tower this morning the bridges are bleating

You‚Äôre fed up living with antiquity

Even the automobiles are antiques
Religion alone remains entirely new religion
Remains as simple as an airport hangar

In all Europe only you O Christianism are not old
The most modern European Pope Pius X it‚Äôs you
The windows watch and shame has sealed
The confessionals against you this morning
Flyers catalogs hoardings sing aloud
Here‚Äôs poetry this morning and for prose you‚Äôre reading the tabloids
Disposable paperbacks filled with crimes and police
Biographies of great men a thousand various titles

I saw a pretty street this morning I forgot the name
New and cleanly it was the sun‚Äôs clarion
Executives laborers exquisite stenographers
Criss-cross Monday through Saturday four times daily
Three times every morning sirens groan
At the lunch hour a rabid bell barks
The lettering on the walls and billboards
the doorplates and posters twitters parakeet-style
I love the swank of that street
Situated in Paris between the rue Aumont-Thieville and the avenue des Ternes

Here‚Äôs the young street and you‚Äôre still a baby
Dressed by your mother in blue and white only
You‚Äôre very pious and with your oldest friend Rene Dalize
Nothing is more fun than Masses and Litanies

It‚Äôs nine o‚Äôclock the gaslight is low you leave your bed
You pray all night in the school chapel
Meanwhile an eternal adorable amethyst depth
Christ‚Äôs flamboyant halo spins forever
Behold the beautiful lily of worship
Behold the red-haired torch inextinguishable
Behold the pale son and scarlet of the dolorous Mother
Behold the tree forever tufted with prayer
Behold the double gallows honor and eternity
Behold the six-pointed star
Behold the God who dies on Friday and rises on Sunday
Behold the Christ who flies higher than aviators
He holds the world's record for altitude

Christ pupil of the eye
Twentieth pupil of the centuries knows its stuff
And bird-changed this century like Jesus climbs the sky
Devils in the abyss look up to watch
They say this century mimics Simon Magus in Judea
It takes a thief to catch a thief they cry
Angels flutter around the pretty trapeze act
Icarus Enoch Elijah Apollonius of Tyana
Hover as close to the airplane as they can
Sometimes they give way to other men hauling the Eucharist
Priests eternally climbing the elevating Host
The plane descends at last its wings unfolded
bursts into a million swallows
Full speed come the crows the owls and falcons
From Africa ibis storks flamingoes
The Roc-bird famous with writers and poets
Glides Adam‚Äôs skull the original head in its talons
The horizon screams an eagle pouncing
And from America there comes a hummingbird
From China sinuous peehees
Who have only one wing and who fly in couples
And here‚Äôs a dove immaculate spirit
Escorted by lyre-bird and shimmery peacock

Phoenix the pyre the self-resurrected
Obscures everything ardently briefly with ash
The sirens abandon their perilous channels
Each one singing more beautifully arrives
Everyone eagle Phoenix Chinese peehees
Eager to befriend a machine that flies

You are walking in Paris alone inside a crowd
Herds of buses bellow and come too close
Love-anguish clutches your throat
You must never again be loved
In the Dark Ages you would have entered a monastery
You are ashamed to overhear yourself praying
You laugh at yourself and the laughter crackles like hellfire
The sparks gild the ground and background of your life
Your life is a painting in a dark museum
And sometimes you examine it closely

You are walking in Paris the women are bloodsoaked
It was and I have no wish to remember it was the end of beauty

In Chartres from her entourage of flames Our Lady beamed at me
The blood of your Sacred Heart drenched me in Montmartre
I‚Äôm sick of hearing blissful promises
The love I feel is a venereal disease
And the image possessing you in your pain your insomnia
Vanishes and it is always near you

And now you are on the Riviera
Under lemon trees that never stop blooming
You are boating with friends
One is from Nice one is from Menton two from La Turbie
We are staring terrified at giant squid
At fish the symbols of Jesus swimming through seaweed

You are in the garden at an inn outside of Prague
You are completely happy a rose is on the table
And instead of getting on with your short-story
You watch the rosebug sleeping in the rose's heart

Appalled you see yourself reproduced in the agates of Saint Vitus
You were sad near to death to see yourself there
You looked as bewildered as Lazarus
In the Jewish ghetto the clock runs backwards
And you go backwards also through a slow life
Climbing the Hradchen listening at nightfall
To Bohemian songs in the singing taverns

You in Marseilles among the watermelons

You in Coblenz at the Hotel Gigantic

You in Rome beneath a Japanese tree

You in Amsterdam with a girl you find pretty who is ugly
She‚Äôs engaged to marry a student from Leyden
Where you can rent rooms in Latin Cubicula locanda
I remember spending three days there and three in Gouda

You are in Paris hauled before the magistrate
You are under arrest you are a criminal now

You went on sorrowful and giddy travels
Ignorant still of dishonesty and old age
Love afflicted you at twenty and again at thirty
I‚Äôve lived like a fool and I've wasted my time
You dare not look at your hands I want to weep all the time
On you on the one I love on everything that frightened you

And now you are crying at the sight of refugees
Who believe in God who pray whose women nurse babies
The hall of the train station is filled with the refugee-smell
Like the Magi refugees believe in their star
They expect to find silver mines in the Argentine
And to return like kings to their abandoned countries
One family carries a red eiderdown you carry your heart
Eiderdown and dreams are equally fantastic

Some of the refugees stay on in Paris settling
Into slums on the rue des Rosiers or the rue des Ecouffes
I have seen them often at dusk they breathe at their doorways
They budge from home as reluctantly as chessmen
They are chiefly Jewish the women wear wigs
And haunt backrooms of little shops in little chairs

You‚Äôre standing at the metal counter of some dive
Drinking wretched coffee where the wretched live

You are in a cavernous restaurant at night

These women are not evil they are used-up regretful
Each has tormented someone even the ugliest

She is the daughter of a police sergeant from Jersey

Her hands I‚Äôd never noticed are hard and cracked

My pity aches along the seams of her belly

I humble my mouth to her grotesque laughter

You‚Äôre alone when morning comes
The milkmen jingle bottles in the street

Night beautiful courtesan the night withdraws
Fraudulent Ferdine or careful Leah

And you drink an alcohol as caustic as your life
Your life you drink as alcohol

You walk to Auteuil you want to go on foot to sleep
At home among your South Sea and Guinean fetishes
Christs of another shape another faith
Subordinate Christs of uncertain hopes

Goodbye Goodbye

These were mostly bits written by J.M. DeMatteis, who is obviously the GOAT with introspective character pieces. Through his writing, we learned what most later re-tellings don‚Äôt bother to explore, which is who May was before Peter came along, why she never had kids of her own, and how she dealt with everything that happened to her. I personally like whenever we get a little more depth in these supporting characters.

1h1n8au,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1h1n8au/the_one_that_got_away_wanted_closure_10_years/,"""The one that got away"" wanted closure 10 years later and 3 years into her marriage is this normal? M-33 F-30","""The one that got away"" began following me a few months back. We broke up 10 years ago shes been married for 3 years now and with that person for almost 9 years. She met him a year or 2 after me so theyve been together a while.

I was young immature and unsure in the world I believe you have to be happy with yourself before youre happy with someone else.

I walked away away to do what I thought was right by both of us at the time. I always wondered if I made the right decision. I dont know if I wouldve grown up if she was there with me. Maybe id be a better man maybe id still be that frustrated insecure kid unsure of everything. It was real though. Im in a better place. Two college degrees etc. We met in high school and dated for years it wasnt the most healthy relationship all the time. Nothing physical but just angry young dumb kid stuff but we were in love.

She started liking my stuff a lot lately and she reached out to me the other day via reply to IG story (I kinda thought she would at some point) and how she was happy to see me doing so well etc. Im a comedian and things have been decent lately. She said she had been talkikg to her friends about messaging me for a month now.

Long story short we text for a day straight. 

We met up (her suggestion) and I apologized for the past etc. Her reason was to get closure which idk I found incredibly odd. Youve been married for years but needed to reach out now? Her husband doesnt know yet she lied to him about where she was going but I she think may tell him in a few weeks? She hasnt decided. We didnt get physical etc like that just walked and talked for two hours.

She asked why I never reached out if I wanted to chat like I claimed and I said she was married and was going to respect her happiness. My sister told me to lay all the cards on the table so I told her how I still felt and was in love and never stopped because I realized this may be the only chance to see her.

 Now I know a lot of you will say in love with the past etc but I'm not I often think of her and my screw ups and always feel like im trying to dig myself out of the hole the younger man did.

She said shes happily married and I said I understand and respect that.
She said she felt bad and I said don't I get it that ships sailed I said I understand I get it. She said at some point shes going to start a family with this person and I told her not to. Not him anways but she assured me out time was done and I said I udnerstood. I think she was taken back by my calm demeanor of accepting her wishes. She said we cant talk anymore or carry any sort of relationship and again I said I understood lol (despite her reaching out to me). Shes still going to follow me on socials etc and I her (I blocked her content so I cant actually see her stuff but sometimes curiosity gets the best of me and I look)

My question for everyone is do you consider this emotional cheating on her part? She may or may not tell her husband down the line. We talked and walked for close to two hours.

And do you believe in closure?

 I personally don't but especially after 10 years no contact. Ive been on her mind and come and go on it but she says it sometimes impacts her relationship to her husband. She named a few random things. Even sex being one of them (I told her she could stop right there I didnt wanna hear that one lol) So again just wondering what peoples thoughts are?

Ill be honest I'm really hoping she messages me but won't hold my breath but again my mind cant help but wonder why now? Especially after so long and three years of marriage to hit me up and do this now? It just feels...so odd and to keep it from her husband just makes me wonder if theres feelings there or not on her part?

I just cant help but think this doesnt feel normal after so long and how great she says her life is (shes doing well for herself) but then why contact me?

I feel like Im gaslighting myself convincing myself this is normal that maybe she needed this healing to het things off her chest and I for her but then the more I think about it. Its been 10 years? Why randomly start this now?

Thoughts would be appreciated!

Update:
 She messaged me this morning saying I know I told you not to reach out but just wanted to say thank you for meeting up with me and how it mustve disrupted my life and that she wanted to leave on better terms and not with me sad or bummed out as I appeared and she was sorry and to take care.

I told her I was okay but thank you and to take care of herself. 

I didnt wanna come off as rude idk if I did but just wanted to keep it short.

Day after that she responds to my story saying she felt bad how we left things and if I was okay I told her I was fine again. She said was nervous seeing me and felt like she blacked out during us meeting and was nervous to see me and felt like neither of us got to get everything off our chest. She said she didnt get to say the things she wanted and just forgot out of nerves. She agreed we had a real love and that she just had the itch to see how I was doing but shouldn't have.

I told her its fine but to do me a favor and not contact me unless she was going through a divorce or seperated. Maybe we can grab a coffee and talk about it but always said I wasnt waiting around and that I was excited to find my person whenever fate allowed it. Someone who deserves and loves me. She said I hope that Id find them and that being loved by someone who makes you happy is a great feeling (like I dont know what love is?) Lol but I just let it go. She said no matter how good her life is or how happy her marriage is that we had good times and she has accepted that Ill come in her mind from time to time because we got to live life together for a time too. We wished me good luck.


Sorry for the novel. I guess I just wanted to get peoples thoughts on it? Is this normal? Like Id like opinions of both sexs honestly?


Im also curious what does this say about the foundation of her marriage with him? Is this a bad sign? She mentioned theyve talked about starting a family together Im just curious as she keeps saying her marriage is so happy (shes got a good poker face so I cant tell lol) but if so happy why even have an inch?

How would you handle this situation?

Nmom keeps trying to smooth things over without acknowledging any wrongdoing. I'm trying to keep my distance but she is pushing hard to try and have me over for dinner, go for coffee, rehash past arguments but won't acknowledge her part in the arguments .

How do I make his stop??
How do I keep my boundaries without flat out saying fuck off???  
How do I handle the complete denial of all wrongdoing?

I don't even want her to acknowledge it or apologize. Just friggin ignore the situation and me.

I'm trying to maintain LC because NC is not an option. My house is in her name but with my down payment from money that was meant for me when my dad died.

Unfortunately my dad left everything in her name to split amongst her, my sister, and myself.

I'm not in a position to move for at least a few years. I'm willing to sacrifice the house and the money once I'm in a better financial situation but it's going to take time.

	This years games took place at Perfection news hq.


Day1.
When this years arena came into view many gasps of intrigue followed as this arena was insipred off of the political party that Brannon Price was apart off. The arena was circular in shape with 2 floors the first floor was the live news casting room where a hologram of Optania Kaine announced the results that were kindly opened to the districts vote as well. The capitol was opened up to 50 sectors  after a handful of sectors calls were announced dpeneding on what area of the arena they were in would reward or punsih the tributes.  On the second floor feautured many desks and tvs with sharp pencils  and muggs filed of century old scolding coffee. WIth an addition they were only a few doors that served as optical ilussions but if a tribute were to escape they  would be greeted with a crowd of peacekeepers. Other than that theyre were 5 vending machines on each floor the roof of this news station was also  exxcessable partly due to the factof this years cornocpuia was placed there  and held the usual weapons and saches of coins due to the fact there was no food or water in the corncopuia.

Cameras tuned to Mila(9) eyeing Jaliana (5) carefully  as she was ledged between Tanabo(10) and Rusty(12) the later had been vindectvley smiling at her. While the girl did this back at Tanabo Jalina shouted at Mila to ‚ÄúCover yourself‚Äù. Feeling a little confused she took a near by look seeing Globe(6) inching closer and closer to the edge of his podium with Ella(12) sheilding herself. As the countdown reached 20 seconds the girls sheilded  themselves as Globe fell of his podium. An ungodly BOOM followed as Globe kaboomed with many tributes sheilding there faces with Ella (12) vomiting in disqust. The countdown continued. After Jailiana noticed her district partner 4 podiums downed ledged between Thread(8) and James(9). The two were realived to benext to each other and after the boys nodded the gong soon sounded. 

18 tributes ran forward  and 8 ran back. The 4  flew foward avoiding  shives and swords being thrown left James and Mila noticed the saches and tossed them to Crosby. As he pocketed them James was soon attacked from behind by Rusty(12). James swore while MIla had been process of bashing Zane(11)s head into the ground after he had tried to ambush Jaliana. Crosby swooped in before slicing Rusty‚Äôs throat from behind with James thanking him and after he helped him up the pair noticed a large fight in the middle of the corncopuia bewering to its crescendo. While the  carrers and the 4s and 7s had been fighting each other  they soon stopped seeing the remainder of the legacy pack inching there way forward into the fray. Clover(11) soon took action on an usnupecting Gaia(2) but James soon grabbed a quiver of arrows and a bow before shooting an arrow through the girls spine. Gaia noticed this and as Crosby encouraged the boy to hurry up James braveily ran into the frey and grabbed 3 knives  and a few more hand full of coins.  As he was hit in the shoulder  with a knife curtosey of Tetris (3).  While Loomis(8) went flying past the pair crashing into Tetris. The boy left him to rot with Loomis while Mila and Crosby and Jailiana encouraged him to hurry up as the aliance ran down the stairs and hid behind the first floor news station desk with James putting a comforting hand on Mila‚Äôs shoudler as the girl had been  whimpering in fear as the cahos raged on. Back on the cornopuia roof the fight between the  Perfection party and Legacy party tributes begun to dye down as the 4s and 7s chassed after  the remaninding outliars while the pairs from 1 and 2 finshed off a stray Pannel(10) and Rox and Nox(14).

15 minutes went by as a total of 9 bloodbath cannons sounded.  The alliance  was quite bemused seeing the large projection of the current election being displayed  on the tv projection with both candiates being at 0-0. Occasionally the projection of the current elction would switch  to the audience in snow square avidly watching the games. Jaliana claimed she was hungry before asking if they had any food. However Mila remarked of how their were some strange parcles in the corncopuia which  Crosby claimed they were saches. When Mila asked him on what they were Crosby said they were a type of purse that could hang across ones waist or could be  worn diagonally. The other 3 were confused but after an akward moment of  modeling many in the audience cheered with Airabella laughing saying ‚ÄúAt least there trying‚Äù.

 After an hour went by an odd noise was heard. The tributes were quite confused and so were the audience but head game maker Doolitle answered the confusion by stating this odd noise was known as an call   which signfied the votes in a specific area had been accounted for. Optania Kaine announced to the tributes that sector A3 A10  A39 A26 A47 of the captial and the casted votes of citizens of  District 2 had sent there votes for Dionsyus Sharpe leaving him at the early leaguge of 28-0. As she signed off a loud bang followed  with the remaining 17 tributes to jump up in alarm as the other sectors of the arena that weren't A3 A10 A26 A39 A47 and  district 2  citizens groudnbelow turned a painfuly burning sensation.

As the  certain areas of teh arena turned a bubbly  orange reamrkably no cannons soudned following. A 2 minute timer  soon was displayed as an old timey game of floor is lava followed by Crosby and James helping Mila and Jaliana through the lava filled ground. However  thankfully for them the second floor they were near by sector A12 and A4 and A5 which were  a large areas of concretite floor the boys took there leap of faith and barreled into a near by desk. Cheers followed  as the boys laughed  and hugged while the girls managed to colide into them as well.


The lava went back into thr ground leaving a  chily quite follow.  The aliance made there way down to the 2nd floor however Mila claimed  she thought she heard somebody. James took a peak but later took his gaze back up to his aliance before humrously saying ‚ÄúIf you dont want to become carrer dog food I suggsest we stay hear‚Äù. While the audience laughed the 5s agreed with this statment but as Mila bruished this off  as she took one step down before being tackled to the ground by  Ella(12).

The girl held a chipped coffe mug to the others neck lucjily for her  Mila kicked Ella in the stomach resulting in her tumbling down the stairs before suddenly being projectiled up again. A call was soon heard with Optanina reavling captiol sector A1 and A50 and  DIstrict 9 to have sent there votes for Brannon Price givining him a quick lead by 5 points, 32-28. As the spot where Ella fell  was a trap as the gril flew into the ceiling. As her cannon sounded and after she was removed  a chime was soon heard and as the 4 in the stair well grinned they opened there box sposnorgift seeing 4 large bottles of water  steamed veggies and a  captial cake. The 4 smiled seeing all these goodies before dead bolting a supply room door and lowering the shades and dinning on there early dinner.

While the 4 ate  Mila remarked alloud ‚ÄúSo mr comedian make us laugh its a depressing athmopshere in here‚Äù. As James looked up again before remarking ‚ÄúThe comedian is not in the office please try your call again later‚Äù. As Crosby laughed hysterically  so did Jaliana and snow square  with James adding in ‚ÄúGet your ego out of your ass too‚Äù. As Mila blushed bright red she tried to conjure up a resposne before James sharply added in ‚ÄúExhibt A you nearly got that neck snapped by the miner‚Äù.

As Mila was now a lost for words the sighed before saying ‚ÄúPlease try to not get us killed‚Äù. The girl sighed before ffinshing her steamed vegetables in the corrner until Jaliana checked in with her later in the evening. Jaliana softened seeing the girl weeping asking ‚ÄúCaptial screw you over hun‚Äù.  Mila nodded before allowing the girl to talk her ear off about her woes. Afterword the group made up for the 50 milonth time. After the boys declared they would keep watch first horn of plenty played feautring the fallen tributes. Tetris(3) Globe(6) Loomis(8) Pannel(10) Clover and Zane(11) Ella and Rusty (12) and Rox and Nox(14) leaving 16 remaining.

Day 2.

		A humorous anecdote followed in the morning with Crosby rolled on top of James while the girls were on there night watch and when James awoke from his slumber he looked up and not seeing any light he remarked ‚ÄúThe dark the dark its calling me‚Äù‚Äù. This caused Crosby to stir awake and realzing he was on someone else he looked in alarm seeing a squished James. He  appologised causing the boy to laugh and joke about a time his older sister Rebbeca‚Äôs friend fell off of  a double decker bed over a sleep over and landed on him. Jaliana laughed and joked  about the legticmay of that stament resulting in Mila saying ‚ÄúHes laughiing thats good thing‚Äù.  Before the pair were about to  move to see if anything happened over th night James frowned before claming ‚ÄúGirly look at ur pants‚Äù. 


	The rest of the alaince frowned seeing the gray mush of the cake on the back of Mila‚Äôs pants however before Jaliana was about to respond a call overview was heard. The remaining 16 looked at the tvs as Optania displayed the call results from over night. A8 A21A26A36A40A41A2 build the current standings up 56-61. These sectors illuminated a solographic light which followed with a cannon sounding moments after. Estrella(6) had unforeanutly been the unlucky one as the girl had been sitting directly under a light and as she tried to buy a pack of Jonah waffle egg sandwich‚Äôs before she was burnt to a crisp.

     As the light event was over Crosby asked if the ‚ÄúLegacyists were near by‚Äù. MIla took a peak out of the door before screaming as spear nearly flew into her eye. Gaia(2) and Princeton (1) grinned before  breaking the  door down with Gaia putting Jaliana and in a choke hold while Princeton gunned down James. Mila was in 2 minds seeing  them and as she ran off Crosby screamed and called her a ‚ÄúSpineless bitch‚Äù. Remarkably Jaliana managed to over power Gaia taking one of her knive in her pocket before slicing her carteine arrteri. As she slumped to the ground her cannon sounded imedtlay with Princeton retalitaing in anger before taking Gaia(2)s supplys before throwing  a knife into Jaliana‚Äôs leg before running off.

However James and Crosby cornered the boy and after a fiar fight the boys from 5 and 9 over powered the carrer boy with James snapping Princetons neck. His cannon sounded moments after with Crosby yelling that ‚ÄúShit for brains abondened them‚Äù. When the two turned around Jaliana‚Äôs leg turned black signfing internal bleeding. Jaliana told them to leave her and wished them luck as Crosby tearfully nodded he put he put her out of her misery as her cannon sounded. Crosby swore revenge on MIla  however an call was soon hurred again showing however as  the other sectors were not triggered Optainia announced that the districy 5 tributes had been given an extra advantage. Intrequie followed as Mayor Kaine casted off the remaining votes a sposnor gift flew in for the  boy.


	Crosby became delighted seeing this gift and after he opened it James was supprised as this was an ‚ÄúTracker projection‚Äù. However after hearing a sizzling sound James shoutted ‚ÄúDROP THE CHEATING DEVICE ITS A TRAP!‚Äù. Crosby did this in the nick of time while the device exploded this targeted the attention of a near by Tannabo (10) but he had not wanted to confront them due to him nursing a sore ankle after he narrowly escaped death curtosey of Cypress(7).  The boys  ran up back to the corcnopuia roof and after checking to make sure no other tributes were near by Crosby suddenly kissed him due to fright and the fact he almost died. James appeard to be quite flustered and as the boy appologised the boy bashfuly grinned claming he ‚ÄúDidnt mind‚Äù. The boy grinned as James returned the kiss before the two rested on the cornucopia roof with James bandging up James‚Äôs small cuts on his face and nursing his leg with bandages.

	While the two loved birds rested keeping each other from boreddom by talking about what they would do if they won cameras cut to Mila on the floor below the boys. She apperad to spy on the conversation having a  thought cross her mind that she declared she would save for later. Before evening a call was heard with sector A4 and A43 casting there votes to the Perfection party giving 19 votes to Brannon brining the score to 85-72. The winning number the vice presidents had been aiming for were 350. Luckily for the remaining tributes the A4 and A43 sectors were actually traps as a  tidal wave and bear traps were triggered with unforeanutly no tributes were at.

	MIla hid in the  girls restroom before barketing herself in the toilet and as she did her buisness cameras tuned back to the boys at the corcnopuia cuddling. James asked if Crosby would be ok with going down to the first floor stating of how the oair from 4 and 7 were currently hiding in the news casting room. Crosby claimed he felt more safe at the corcnopuia and he would be willing to change locations the next day. James smiled  however a sposnor gift soon flew in the boy looked curiously at it. The boy smiled seeing a small dagger with a note attached to it saying ‚ÄúBecareful with it save it for the carrers‚Äù-T. The boy left the dagger in the sposnor gift and keeping it with them James was about to ask Crosby if he would want to keep watch but seeing that he was asleep on his shoulder the boy grinned before quietly smiling and keeping watch. One more cannon sounded in the later  evening being Thread(8) as he passed out due to no food with his mentor Miley Gilen sighing in despair that she couldnt save her tribute. Horn of plenty played feauturing the fallen Princeton (1) Gaia(2) Jalina(5) Estrella(6) and Thread(8) leaving 11 left.

	.
		

         Trouble in paradise followed the next day as Crosby kissed a good morning to James  however the boy asked ‚ÄúWhy are there marks in my arm‚Äù. Just as Crosby had been  covering the knife with his hands James laughed before saying ‚ÄúDon't even try it kid‚Äù. Realzing the act had concluded in  rotten tomatos Crosby attempted to disarm James by jumping on his back but James let himself fall back crushing Crosby below with the knife he had tried to use on James finding its home in Crosby‚Äôs heart. His cannon sounded followed by appluase in snoq square with Lucius appluading the boy on catching on quickly.

	After Crosby was removed by hover craft James begun his day by eating some spare rations he had left before peaking under the corncopuia latch. Seeing theyre were not to many other tributes there he looked at the  news projection that had been sitting at an suprsing tie 150-150. The only sectors left in the captial were A9 A14-A18 A28-A36 A42-A46 and districts 1 3 4  6 8 11 and 14 left. However a chime was soon heard as the remaining 10 tributes looked up at the tv projections seeing head game maker Doolittle appluading them on making it to the 3rd day. He announced that in 5 minutes if a tribute werent in the first floor the tributes trackers would denoateand told them to wait for further instructions.

	The audience in snow square sequealed in exicetment as another call followed giving Dionsyus 67 votes taking of sectors A14 to A 18 with district 1 and 6 also being taken off the field.  As half of the second floor turned a lava filled mess the 10 tributes made there way to the first floor. After noticing each other Mila gave James the middle finger he recipercated as the other  8 tributes talked in an confused manner not knowing what would happen next. After a while 10 minecarts and 10 pickaxes rose  from the ground with head game maker doolittle adding in tha the tributes had 20 minutes to find and destroy a item. This item would display on  the tributes trackers and if they were unable to destory this item there tracker would denoanate, As the tributes boarded the minecrafts a loud screeching noise was heard resul,ting in the carts zooming foward. Feeling nausiated Mila groaned seeing the projection of a  bettle the girl groaned before screaming ‚ÄúWATCH WHERE YOU THROW YOUR TOYS IDIOT !‚Äù. Mindy(3) laughed before soon screaming in horror as Mila  crashed into her mine cart. As the girl echoed the same setement  tje girl screamed as she soon fell off of her mine  cart cracking her head on the ground. After her cannon sounded Mila rolled her eyes before looking at her tracker that displayed a bettle.

       Luckily as the girl saw the bettle which was a 3D portrait she hurled her only  pickaxe into the portrait a cheer was soon heard as she was soon ejected from her mine cart . As teh girl landed on a desk in the first floor she grinned before hiding in heep under it while the other 4 tributes who were still looking for there item soon had a ‚Äúboost‚Äù added into there Minecraft‚Äôs. James looked on in bewlderment seeing  a portait of Ryan on his tracker. The boy smirked before laughing saying ‚ÄúYour kidding right?‚Äù. Luckily as his mine cart rolled past his previous camp a portait of his older brother  giving him a threatnening look. As the cart raged on he screamed his now iconic line ‚ÄúTRAUMA AINT GOT NOTHIN ON ME NO MORE!‚Äù. Before hurling his picaxe into the portait and as a cheer followed  from the arema and in snow square the boy was ejected from his mincart and once  landing on the ground he baracated the door before  finding his abonded bow and quiver of arrows before wearing i across his side. As 2 more cheers followed there was one yelp that soon followed. Tanabo(10) was close to breaking his assigned item but at the last second tipped out of his minecart right into the lap of Cypress(7). As his throat was soon slit his cannon soon sounded.


	For the rest of the day not to much more action happened by irritated carrers grumbling  that they had no food left resulting in Cypress(7) to snap Mekis(4)‚Äôs neckin a fit of rage during an argument the aliamnce had been having resulting in Isbaella(4) running off to not become the 7s next target.Before dusk  entered  the arena another call was soon casted  that teh citzens of district 1 and sector A9 and A28-A32 casted there votes in for the Perfection party bossting  them to 275-217. Horn of plenty played a mid night feauturing the fllen Mindy(3) Mekis(4) Crosby(5)  and Tannabo(10) leaving  just 7 left.

	
		Over night another cannon sounded being the boy from 2 after he had tried to ambush the girl from 1 as she slept but she caught him in the nick of time before pushing himinto an oncoming mine crat getting hit in the face with it. After the boy was removed the girl grinned  and skipped her way back to bed with out a care in the world. The remainder of this day was quite the sleepy one as the remaining sectors in the captiol that still nedded to cast there votes were still doing this while the tributes did move an inch from there spots. At midnight only the boy from 2s portait was shown leaving only the girl from 1 Isabella 4 Cypress and Rocco (7) and Mila and James (9) left.





	As the elction had come to its nail bitter  climax remarkably all sectors in the capitol and there districts  casted there votes and when the hosts tuned into the live arena coverage they were supprised seeing it a total mess. The captiol however had been enjoying this mess greatly. A live poll was realsed during the early morning watch party by Cyrus Monty the now lead host of ‚ÄúThe early bird gets the gold‚Äù morning tv show and after the votes were casted  the results were in. James and  Cypress(7) had been strongly fighting for the number 1 to win spot with 45% of the votes with Mila(9) having a reatively surprising 2bnd place leaguge  with 32% tieing withe girl from 1 and as the othe rplacements werent worth mentoining a cannon boomed out.

	The minecrats had been triggered for the finale of this year's games crashing into the girl from 1 causing her to fly into the arena roof. Her cannon  soon sounding. After the cannon it hjolted James awake and after taking a exmaination of his suroundings he took a large breathe before running up to the corncopuia roof. Game maker Doolittle  made a live annonuncement moments after the girls cannon sounded congratulating the remaing 5 on making it this far before stating that if a tribute werent  in news room 1 in 5 minutes would go under peanilty of tracker denoation.

      As James grabbed his bow he hid behind the large ballot of box placd in for the winner to cast the final vote Mila arrived in a frenzy of screams after she had been ejected from her mind cart while the 7s loudly shouted curses as there mine cart malfounctioned and tipped them both over. Rocco had a painful fall landing on his stomach breaking 6 ribs and his neck with his cannon soon following . Isabella laughed as Cypress hurled hheris spear into Isabella‚Äôs  eye. As her cannon sounded Mila hurled her last knife into Cypress‚Äôs side as the girl fell of the side of the rail road and as Cypress cannon sounded the crowd in snow square grew deadly quiet as citzens in district 9 were beyond extactic with the 16 year drought the district had finally comming to a nice end.

        James quietly peeked his bow at searching for his final opponent and eventually she showed. Mila smiled before declaring of how it was ‚Äúa good show but his current call was  calling‚Äù. However it was the polar opposite. The boy soon noticed the girl saving of how she would be continuing the ‚Äúnew world order‚Äù of panem and when she wasn‚Äôt looking an arrow flew into her heart. The girl fell backward as many of her  fans in snowsquare sighed while the majorty cheered. And after Mila‚Äôs cannons sounded he imfaously proclaimed that her ‚ÄúCuuraint call was now‚Äù.

	Laughter followed in snowsquare as many appluaded beforeJames smiled and held his hand up in triumph as James Skilane of district 9 had been crowned as the winner of the 129th games. The roof of the arena opened and after he casted his ‚ÄúFinal vote‚Äù for Brannon the perfection party was dubbed the winners and as the crowds in snow square cheered happily cameras cut to James walking onto the hovercaft embracing Luke and Travis as the hovercraft soon left the arena. 

	Followibg his stay at Shorevile hopsital James was treated for his wounds and minior bruises and cuts. He requested that his victors interview be pushed up by 2 days so he could rest as this request was utimatley approved he was granted visitors with Luke and Diana Christie victor of the 124th hunger games keeping the lad company at his stay. After his rest days his victors interview was set to take way.


	Airabella warmly welcomed the audience dazzling the crowd in an outfit that resembled one of a game show host. While her husband sat in his usual three piece suit that decorated in rainbow spots. After hyping up the crowd James was brought in. He merrly smiled and waved to the crowd of his adoring fans with him actually manahing to catch a rose in his teeth also dazzling the crowd in a spiffy murron suit and black top hat..  After greeting the hosts the interview kicked off with Airabella declaring that his victors nickname was to be ‚Äú Sir Pegasus‚Äù for hiscalm demanor in the arena and manging to keep his mind sain when with his aliance. The boy was bemused at this nickname asking ‚ÄúYour nicknaming me after a horse?‚Äù. As the captial crowd laughed hysterically the hosts suggested possible name ideas until James claimed he liked the named ‚ÄúGovernor funny man‚Äù. As the audience echoed this setdement  the hosts seemed to like it to before going over the games. When the hosts went over the deaths he seemed unbothered on giving his ‚ÄúHonst opion‚Äù on certain tributes. When Mila‚Äôs was shown James laughed saying ‚ÄúDarling wanted to make a new world order but failed miseraby‚Äù.  The audience laughed with Lucius asking if the boy was ‚ÄúStill scared of his brother‚Äù. As a chilly quet followed  James smiled and said ‚ÄúNot any more‚Äù. As the audience appluaded happily Airabella asked James on what he would do once he returned home to district 9. The shrugged before claimming ‚ÄúTaking a fat nap then go from there‚Äù. Following laughs from the citzens watching from the audience the hosts thanked James for his time as the crowd cheered his victors nickname resulting in him bowing and leaving the stage.

	To conclude the night of festivties head game maker Doolittle was welcomed to the stage in rapserous appluase. The boy waved curtesoly to the captial audience  in a well kempt dark blue suit with navy patched suit. Before his interview begun he thanked Optania for letting him use her news studio as an arena promising that ‚ÄúAll damage and mine carts would be removed and payed for by the game making department.‚Äù  He did also claim to physch the audience up he announced within the next 13 years special famed socialites and guests would be joining him which caused ripples of cheers to follow from the crowd he gave a hint to one of them that a ‚ÄúPrevious game maker may be one of them‚Äù. Further ripples of cheers followed however in  true Doolitle fashoin he kept his mouth sealed when Airabella and Lucius pestered the boy for hints on the arena. Noticing tje level of exictement in the captial got a litlle to crazy the hosts good naturedly signed of with the 2 hosts and head game maker bowing ending the night on a high.

	James returned home distirct 9 the following Autum to a warm welcome home celebration that was thrown by the district. He moved his family into victors village and became the mentor to furture district 9 tributes. Along with being a mentor he became good friends with Flora Petalbloom victor of the 126th hunger games joinning her on becoming a stand up comedian.  Besides his boming fame in the captiol he would later take over as mayor of district 9 for a whopping 25 years after Belfrey stepped down the year after the 140th games where the district found itself another victor. He would later meet and marry his fututure wife Lysandra Springer the pair would go on and have 4 kids with his best friend Luke becoming the god father to James‚Äôs children. Even though not the biggest presence in the room James was known as a loving mayor mentor husband an friend to all being dubbed as the ‚ÄúKindest victor‚Äù in the history of the hunger games.

The gp I saw told me she‚Äôs has gastritis since she was a teenager (she looks about late 40s) to which she said it can‚Äôt be cured, you just have to live with it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm 19 years old and I‚Äôve had it for about 3 years, not knowing what it was until the start of this year. I have symptoms probably everyday, mostly of bloating soreness located above belly button or sternum, and acid reflex. I take ppi 20mg for a few months now on and off. My diet probably isn‚Äôt as good as it should be, but I‚Äôve cut a lot of things off like alcohol, coffee, sugary drinks (I occasionally have a Diet Coke if I‚Äôm out for dinner) and I also found out I‚Äôm lactose intolerant so I no longer have lactose either. I believe my gastritis was caused by my overtaking of ibiprofen because I had insane period pain, that feels similar to the gastritis pain. I also have crippling anxiety and am a bit depressed so I believe those both are why I have it. 

The everyday symptoms, though they do suck- I can deal with that. What I cant deal with is that every now and then I‚Äôll get into these long episodes of agonising pain where I‚Äôll be screaming, banging my head on the floor trying to make myself pass out because the pain is so bad. It started off with the episodes being about once every 6 months, to once every 3 months, and now I‚Äôve just had the pain again in less than a months time from last‚Ä¶ so clearly it‚Äôs getting worse, it‚Äôs been 2 days now and I still feel a bit of pain from it. To describe the pain it‚Äôs like someone is churning my guts and also an overwhelming feeling of emptiness in my stomach- it is the most painful thing I have ever experienced ever. The reason I went to the gp was to get prescribed anxiety medication in hopes that it may help reduce my gastritis symptoms too. Now that she‚Äôs told me that gastritis can‚Äôt be cured I honestly just want to bawl my eyes out. I cant live like this for the rest of my life.
I‚Äôm seeing a gastroenterologist in a couple days too so I cant live like talk to someone who actually specialises in that stuff‚Ä¶ I really can‚Äôt do this life",1,1732765080.0,Gastritis,7,1.0,False

Never have and honestly it's better now that I'm totally independent of her and she can't hold basic needs over my head. One of the main reasons I'm still in contact with her is that my dad has dementia and I am helping to care for him and make medical decisions for him. I was doing much more before getting pregnant and have had to take a step back, which she has given me huge pushback with. It's not healthy but I'm doing my best with this.*

So my husband and I have decided to wait to find out baby's sex until they pop out. There are several reasons for this but mainly that we really value sustainability and this is one way for us to prevent a ton of gendered items before baby is even here. And since they're our first and we plan on having at least one more, having gender neutral items will be great for hand-me-downs. 

My mother does not respect this at all. One other thing, she keeps trying to touch my belly and gets deeply offended when I tell her no. I'm 10 weeks now and she's been doing this since about 5/6 weeks. I'm not showing now and I sure as heck wasn't showing back then. 

Here's a list of everything related to my baby's sex that she's said over the last 6 weeks, all of which I've shot down or told her off for:

* When I told her we weren't finding out baby's sex she said she would have to ""come to an ultrasound appointment so she could sneak a peak herself""
* She has referred to baby as a girl and has told me she thinks they're a girl
* Yesterday when I mentioned I had my first prenatal appointment today she said she hopes that I ""accidently see baby's sex on the screen"" when I said that even if we accidentally found out we wouldn't be telling anyone she accused me of being willing to tell my in laws but not her
* When I called her today to say we heard baby's heartbeat and all is well she asked how fast it was. I told her but said ""the midwife said it's healthy so it doesn't really matter"". She said she wanted to know because she heard that could tell what sex the baby is. I told her that's an old wives tale and there's so many factors that can influence that, like the safe amount of coffee I drank today. She said I ""better not be drinking coffee while carrying her grandchild""

So clearly there are a lot of problems here, but just kinda looking for some advice around the baby's sex. Has anyone else received pushback about not finding out if baby is a boy or girl?",0,1732765067.0,BabyBumps,6,0.5,False

If you could swing by my cluttered house while we try to sip coffee and talk between the constant interruptions from my toddler. 

I‚Äôd tell you that this stay at home mom gig is so much harder than I imagined. That even though I love being a mom, and am so grateful to be able to stay home and raise my toddler while pregnant with my next, I‚Äôm starting to understand the exhausted, burnt out, bitter mom storyline we‚Äôve seen portrayed on screen and in families. And I‚Äôm not a bitter person, I‚Äôm really not. Yet, why is it that this most difficult job I‚Äôve ever held, is looked over by everyone as not a real career? Why is it that my husband‚Äôs friends can just ask him to join them without any consideration for childcare arrangements, yet I need to call 3 people to try and make it to a scheduled doctors appointment? How am I supposed to have an identity outside of a wife and mom, when the only reasonable ‚Äúhobby‚Äù I can make time for must happen after the kids are asleep for the night.

I‚Äôve talked to my husband and tried to get him to understand. I just need a couple days with you where I don‚Äôt have to share you, where I‚Äôm first on your list. I‚Äôm lonely and sad, I‚Äôm sick of waking up alone. He works too much, and his imbalance means that my life is imbalanced. But he can‚Äôt see it. All he sees is how hard he works for me, and all the things he can buy me, when I just keep asking for time. For perspective: he has not taken a weeks vacation in a year. And he works most Saturdays. He just told me that I‚Äôm unhappy most of the time, and don‚Äôt even seem like I want to spend time with him. But how do I get him to understand the immense loneliness of being a stay at home mom? How touched out and overstimulated I can become by 11am? Some days just feel like I‚Äôm trying to swim against the current all day just surviving. Not even finishing the dishes or laundry - just surviving. How can you possibly know what it‚Äôs like to give up all your independence and former identity for your family; to just be kept waiting at the door like a sad dog for your husband to come home? I don‚Äôt know. And I don‚Äôt know what my best friend would tell me. I know that I need to take accountability for my own life, and make the most of my circumstances. But how much exploration and personal fulfillment can you have while toting around a toddler? 

I imagine that if I had a best friend, you‚Äôd be a stay at home mom too. So, you‚Äôd understand what I mean. And that simple truth would help make this job seem much less lonely. Maybe we wouldn‚Äôt fix it over coffee, but somehow just by talking to you, things would feel lighter. Thank you. ",10,1732764989.0,sahm,4,0.92,False

So I tried using the Google Drive link as a source for the project knowledge files in a new project.

Claude says it cannot access external links. It cannot open the file that has a direct link from the document to the project knowledge.

Asking Claude *how* I can give it access to that file, it simply repeats that I should copy and paste the content into the conversation. It is a 9MB word document. Shant!

Why have a Google Drive link option for project knowledge files if Claude can't actually access the files?

EDIT: I went and had a coffee and tried asking Claude for help again - and this time I think it might be on to something:

**How can I fix the link to the google drive document?**

To fix the Google Drive link issue, you'll need to:

1. Make sure the document is shared with the proper permissions:
   * Open the document in Google Drive
   * Click the ""Share"" button in the top right
   * Change the access settings to either:
      * ""Anyone with the link can view"" or
      * Make it public
2. Generate a proper sharing link:
   * Click ""Share"" button
   * Click ""Copy link"" at the bottom of the sharing dialog
   * Paste that link in our conversation

The current link appears to be a backend API URL rather than a standard sharing link. A proper Google Drive sharing link typically looks like: [`https://docs.google.com/document/d/[document-ID]/edit?usp=sharing`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/[document-ID]/edit?usp=sharing)

Once you provide the corrected link or paste the document content directly into our conversation, I can help you write \[a treatsie on the harmonizing impacts of egalitarian random word generation in 13th Century Carpathia\]",1,1732764861.0,ClaudeAI,1,1.0,False

At 6 months we started on solids. Fruits and veggies were good. Then oats caused hives, excessive spit ups, drowsiness 3 hrs after ingestion. Our peds did an IgE panel for basic allergens and oat. Milk came back as low. Oats was moderate. So we were referred to an allergist. 

Allergist did a skin prick for milk and it came back positive. Allergist didn‚Äôt have oat for skin prick but thinks the oat reaction is fpies. He gave us the ok for dairy ladder and give frozen breast milk with dairy in it.  

Today I gave my son frozen breast milk that had dairy in it. He started having multiple stools and one of them was mucusy and looked like dark blood specks.

Been getting to know a co-worker of mine for a good few months now and we've built some nice momentum talking more and more. I know she enjoys talking to me and we've had some quite lengthy conversations sometimes.  I've also let her come to me on a couple of occasions just to make sure its more than just me always going to her. I make her laugh a lot and I've thrown some subtle flirtation her way but she doesn't seem like the type that will easily give into that, or she's just naive to what I'm trying to do.

Either way, I am just not sure if she would actually go out with me and add on the fact that she is a co-worker, I really want to be as cool and carefree as possible and not put any pressure on her. We do NOT work together everyday which is a good thing. More like once every two weeks. So if she said no it wouldn't be that weird. For more context, on only one occasion have I referenced hanging outside of work, where I (in a semi sarcastic tone) told her that when she gets promoted we will grab a drink to celebrate. She simply smiled, laughed and very casually said ok before we instantly moved onto another topic. We have never even exchanged numbers (no reason to) and have never gotten lunch or coffee during work. I considered asking her to walk with me to get lunch one day, but that could backfire as I wouldn't want to draw attention to us as many others in the office would take notice of us leaving together. So thats pretty much out of the question.

So, does anyone have any very clever ways to ask out a woman or hint at making plans, etc, so it comes off super casual and indirect? And lastly, what would a good realistic get together look like? Its even more difficult bc she lives rather far from me (solid hour) so its not like I could say I want to check out a place near me and she should come. It would have to be some specific place we picked thats sort of in the middle of us. In addition, she also works super late (much later than me), so even going out after work somewhere is out of the question. Thanks in advance.",2,1732764561.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

Main theme: Protagonists of comedic and absurd parodies of more violent and serious sagas.

Connections: Both are the protagonists of two mini series of videos focused on action and comedy, not taking themselves too seriously by putting memes, references and exaggerations in these same videos, also parodying more violent and serious indie sagas (TF2 and MadCom), also with their touches of comedy, but very far from those that these parodies present.

‚Ä¢Both start conflicts that lead them to fight against armies or people of similar power to theirs, always for the silliest reasons that only make sense in their stories (the booty slayer starting a whole fight against an army and a fight against the buff soldier to find anime girls with good BOOTY, Gabriel fighting against the A.A.H.W, a G03LM mk2, the janitor, a demogrunt and a Mag agent because they spilled his coffee or made it ""illegal"" to WEAR YELLOW-)

‚Ä¢Both do exaggerated and absurd things in general, either casually or in combat, not making any sense even in the universes they parody.

‚Ä¢Despite the above, they have also shown a pretty good combat skill, in some cases comically exaggerated.

Minor connections:

‚Ä¢Both faced a parody of a TF2 character, which gave both of them some problems (the buff soldier and the demogrunt)

(I am 31m)

LONG POST. TLDR at bottom. 


So I do an art club/group with 11 other people, and four months back a new guy (19m) joined. I would consider myself acquainted with the other members of the club, but he and I became ‚Äòfriends‚Äô very quickly. We got along so well, and it‚Äôs rare for me to connect with someone these days. 

We‚Äôve met outside of the meetings multiple times a week in the last few months. One time we went to the museum near us for a quaint (platonic) study-date and also had dinner at a fancy restaurant that I could barely afford, and it was likely one of my favourite days out of my whole life. Things were looking up for me after meeting him and I was happy in its purest form.

But two weekends ago I started catching feelings for him. I feel really disgusted with myself and have 0 idea how to handle it. I have a therapist but I‚Äôm even scared to tell her, because I am worried she will think me a pervert. 
I‚Äôll give context: we were in the park doing sketching of each other. There‚Äôs this weird twisty bench that allows us to face each other so we could draw each other. There was a brief moment when I was sketching him that I felt a flutter in my chest, which was short enough, but made me feel uncomfortable. Then, for the remainder of the drawing session, I slowly realised how much I ‚Äòlike‚Äô him, and was very confused. Like the universe knew my stress in that moment, when we finished and traded drawings he liked mine so much that he hugged me, which made my chest flutter even more. This sounds romantic, but I am aware that this is how I have seen predators talk to justify themselves. We grabbed coffee in a cafe and I attempted ignoring what happened at the park but couldn‚Äôt. I had to admit to myself I had feelings for him. 
On the night when I got home, I couldn‚Äôt sleep because I thought I was a creep or that I was a predator. I decided to ignore it and try to forget, because I did not want to jeopardise our friendship. For a few nights this was the same, and progressively got a little better as I got to my senses.

The next time we met was in the week after work, when he and I had dinner at our favourite restaurant. This was terrible awful timing because of the connotation of going to a restaurant with someone, and I considered dropping it but decided not to because he expressed an interest in us going for ages. When we got there I actually had maybe an hour of peace where I was distracted by our conversations. We got dessert, and it went to shit all over again when he noticed a nick in my hand, and literally held it to inspect it, which started the flutters again. I ate really quickly, we split the bill, and drove him home and cried all night.

We are supposed to go watch something at the theatre this weekend but I can‚Äôt go. I told him that I‚Äôm ill and he seemed fine about it, but I have a lot of thinking to do. I‚Äôm not sure whether to talk to my therapist about this, or if I should isolate myself. I have even considered staging an argument with him to ‚Äòbreak off‚Äô from him. Because I‚Äôm anonymous, I really do think I love him, but I know I shouldn‚Äôt and that it‚Äôs extremely immoral and unexplainable. 
Tonight I‚Äôm asking for advice/help or just kind words because this mixed with my depression is starting to cause *those* ideations to come back again, especially given the context. 


TLDR: been catching feelings for a younger friend for a couple of weeks, and I find this attraction disgusting, and I hate myself. But I don‚Äôt know where to start in getting help or figuring this out, and tonight I feel suicidal. ",1,1732763562.0,SuicideWatch,5,0.67,False

1h1mdk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1h1mdk4/mf_adrian_former_child/,"[MF] Adrian, Former Child","Please take a look at my story *Adrian, Former Child*. It takes place in a small desert community in which a former child celebrity returns home and is having an incredibly awful day. Things only get weirder.



¬†‚ÄúHow was it?‚Äù

The man took his time chewing.

‚ÄúYou sure you ain't Lebanese?‚Äù said the man after finally swallowing.

‚ÄúCross my heart,‚Äù said Adrian.

‚ÄúWell, you fooled me. If I didn‚Äôt know any better, I‚Äôd say you was. That was better than when it used to be an actual shawarma place,‚Äù said the truck driver.

‚ÄúThank you kindly, sir.‚Äù

""You ever think about closing shop and making this a shawarma joint again? You sure are good at it.‚Äù

Adrian had thought of closing shop every minute of every day for the past three years of his life.

‚ÄúAnyway,‚Äù said the truck driver. ‚ÄúYou mind if I take a nap in here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù said Adrian.

He closed the office and let the man sleep. Nobody else was going to show up that day. The truck driver was the first person Adrian had made happy in a long time, and inadvertently, the truck driver had made Adrian happy by not recognizing the former child celebrity. The things Adrian was used to people telling him (especially upon recognition) were, ""You used to be such a cute kid"" (that was a good interaction), but more often than not, it was, ""You grew up to be kind of weird looking.""

Adrian had purchased the space three years ago after returning from Los Angeles. Tonight was his thirty-sixth birthday. Once upon a time, the place had been a family-owned Lebanese restaurant offering residents of Adelanto, California one of the few non-Mexican varieties of ethnic cuisine. One day, the family disappeared, leaving nearly all of their possessions behind in the shop, which coincided with Adrian being run out of Los Angeles. But he wasn‚Äôt run out, not really. His departure was no more than a quiet whimper. He could no longer handle his agent‚Äôs request to go on a podcast. Three years later, Adrian missed the sound of his agent‚Äôs voice.

Once his agent had gone silent, the only calls Adrian got were from his mother. She mostly complained that all of her friend‚Äôs children were blessing their parents with grandchildren, and she was getting antsy. She wanted chubby cheeks to squeeze and spoil. Once Adrian had turned thirty-five, she stopped pressing the issue.

In three years of business in Adelanto, Adrian had had a total of five clients. Of those five clients, three didn‚Äôt pay for his services and took off when they had gotten what they needed. Of the two that paid, they were paying for shawarma. Enough truckers had stopped in asking for shawarma, that Adrian eventually set out to learn how to make the stuff.

He shut the door, not locking it in case the truck driver woke up and decided to go somewhere else after his nap. The *D* had fallen off the door panel, leaving the signage to read: *Napso etective Agency*.

A commotion was getting everyone riled up across the street. People walked through passing cars and pushed one another (including Adrian) out of the way to get a closer look. Adrian was blinded by several camera flashes.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs him! It‚Äôs Johnny Hallbeck!‚Äù multiple voices cried out.

This caused Adrian to freeze, and in his frozen state, Johnny noticed him.

‚ÄúAdrian! Adrian ‚ÄòWhole-eyed‚Äô!‚Äù Johnny called. ‚ÄúAdrian, get over here!‚Äù

Eyes began to divert to Adrian, and soon, all the attention of Adelanto was on him. Adrian, all five-foot-five of him, walked over to Johnny Hallbeck. Hallbeck, at six-foot-three, towered over Adrian, and despite being the same age, Hallbeck could have easily passed for a decade younger. In contrast, everyone assumed Adrian was in his forties.

‚ÄúAdrian, I can‚Äôt believe this. You‚Äôre back. This is incredible.‚Äù

Adrian didn‚Äôt know what to say, and in most situations, when he didn‚Äôt know what to do or say, he froze completely.

‚ÄúEveryone!‚Äù said Hallbeck, putting his large hand around Adrian‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúThis is Adrian Napso! This is the real Kid Detective.‚Äù

Hallbeck leaned in so only Adrian could hear, ""Do you know to this day how many people think my name is actually Adrian and that I'm the one who solved all those cases?""

Hallbeck‚Äôs white smile beamed against the dark desert backdrop.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre filming out in El Mirage Lake tomorrow. Wouldn‚Äôt that be something if you came along? Let me make a couple of calls. The producer‚Äôs a friend of mine, this is going to be fantastic. Why don‚Äôt you give your number to my agent?‚Äù

El Mirage Lake was a dry lakebed several miles outside the city. It used to be open to all visitors free of charge, but now, if people wanted to play around in their gyrocopters or burn out their automobiles, they had to pay for the pleasure. Adrian had only ever been there once, the day he met Hallbeck.

¬†

Marie was crying, and if there was one thing Aslanjeriy couldn‚Äôt abide by, it was little girls upset enough to cry.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù he asked her.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find Monster anywhere,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy doggy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen did you last see Monster?‚Äù Aslanjeriy asked.

‚ÄúI was walking him by our school‚Äôs playground. My dad said don‚Äôt take my eye off him, and I didn‚Äôt, I swear! I turned for one second to run to the ice cream man, and he was gone.‚Äù

""Don't worry, I'll help you find Monster; let's start at the school.""

Though Marie was in his second-grade class, they had never spoken to one another before. Aslanjeriy thought girls were boring and not good at playing the games he and his friends liked to play, but that wasn‚Äôt reason for him to want to see her upset. His mom always told him to be nice to girls.

They started at the school and found no trace of the dog, nor did they find Monster in any of the neighboring blocks. Even when the sun began to set, and Marie said it was time for her to go home, Aslanjeriy didn't give up on the search. That is when things started to get interesting.

Adelanto was quite a small town, the kind of place where most people knew each other, and even if someone wasn‚Äôt familiar by name, they were familiar by face. The city was located in the Victor Valley of the Mojave Desert, and to Aslanjeriy, that containment made it feel like its own little world, and therefore, an unfamiliar face would stick out to him.

Aslanjeriy noticed a tall man in a three-piece suit he‚Äôd never seen before. Most people didn‚Äôt walk around in the desert heat wearing fancy suits like that. The man was walking a dog. Marie described Monster as looking like a mop. This dog had short hair, so it couldn‚Äôt be Monster. Aslanjeriy followed at a distance and saw the man knock on a door. A woman opened the door and nearly burst into tears:

""Oh my god, Bunny! You found my Bunny! I missed you so much, you stupid dog.""

As a thank you, the woman rewarded the man with what seemed like a large sum of money.

For the following two days, seven-year-old Aslanjeriy followed this man, watching as he took dogs and cats away from their owners in public places, and sometimes was even so brazen as to go into their backyards and even enter their houses to take the beloved pets, to hand them back and collect the reward money. Aslanjeriy broke the case to the police, and the small boy from the small city of Adelanto became a local celebrity. But, after all was said and done, he never did find Monster, and Marie resented the fame Aslanjeriy had accumulated. A week after that, he solved the case of the missing geometry textbooks at Adelanto High, and a month after that, he discovered where Jimmy Hoffa was.

It wasn't long until local media and TV producers overwhelmed the small desert community. Everyone wanted to snatch up the young detective sensation. In the end, it was Steven Bochco who prevailed, producer of TV‚Äôs *Doogie Howser*. Kids being doctors or pilots or lawyers were all the rage, yet here was the first actual detective, and Bochcho wanted not only to put Aslanjeriy on TV but for him to play himself. Bochcho sent a FAX to David E. Kelley back in Los Angeles:

""This kid has got the most expressive eyes. They pop out of his head. He's a cute kid, but not in an annoying way. I'm telling you Davy, people are going to be rooting for this kid. Kids will want to be him, and parents will want to adopt him/.""

David E. Kelley received the letter and sent a fax of his own:

‚ÄúEverything sounds great, Steve, but there‚Äôs just one problem. What the hell is up with the kid‚Äôs name? The last name is fine; people might take him for some kind of Italian or Native or whatever, but Aslan Jerry? I don't know what that's supposed to be. We can't put that on TV. Change the name, and we're off to a good start.""

¬†

‚ÄúHey kid, stars need a name, don‚Äôt you agree?‚Äù asked Bochco. ‚ÄúTake Charles Bronson. Did you know Bronson wasn‚Äôt his real last name?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt?‚Äù asked Aslanjeriy.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to put Bunchinsky on the marquee and expect American audiences to come flocking. It‚Äôll scare them away. They need something comforting and relatable. So, Charles Bunchinsky becomes Charles Bronson, and now you‚Äôve got yourself a movie star. Say, what kind of a name is Aslanjeriy anyway?""

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Circassian,‚Äù said Aslanjeriy.

""What did you call me? Just kidding, kid, but it's not American. Are you a proud American?""

Aslanjeriy nodded.

‚ÄúI thought so. You‚Äôve got all-American looks. Napso, is that Syracusian as well?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means ‚Äòwhole-eyed‚Äô.‚Äù

""Now, that is what I like to hear! Adrian, the whole-eyed detective! You're Adrian now, kid. Adrian, with the bright, emotive eyes. You‚Äôre going to be great.‚Äù

A month after Adrian‚Äôs eighth birthday, they filmed the pilot episode. He had never taken an acting lesson a day in his life, but that would work to his advantage. The kid was a natural. All of the adult actors got along with him on the set. Nobody pandered to him or belittled him. He held his own against veteran actors like Cameron Mitchell and Rif Hutton. He didn‚Äôt care about them or their pedigree. There was only one that mattered ‚Äî Kayleigh de Mornay. She played his fifteen-year-old babysitter, who was always on the verge of a panic attack when he‚Äôd escape from the house to go on one of his adventures. Looking at her was the first time Adrian saw a girl as anything more than someone who wasn‚Äôt as good at playing games as boys. He would purposely flub lines just to make shooting with her go longer. He knew he was only eight, but if he was patient and kept calm, he could make her his. After all, their age difference wasn‚Äôt so severe. When he was eighteen, she‚Äôd be twenty-five. His own father was eleven years older than his mother.

What complicated things was the arrival of Cindy Laramie. Halfway into the show‚Äôs first season, test audiences felt Adrian needed a foil, and that‚Äôs why Cindy, who would be playing the character of Anjelica, was thrown into the mix. She was Moriarity to his Sherlock, but after several seasons of butting heads and antagonism, they developed a friendship that turned into a *will-they-won‚Äôt-they* for viewers.

Adrian never thought he‚Äôd have a crush on a girl his own age, but something was happening inside him. One day, while filming out in the desert in stifling hot weather, they held hands. It was the first time he‚Äôd ever held a girl‚Äôs hand.

Then, Adrian turned thirteen.

¬†

‚ÄúDear God, what the hell happened?‚Äù said David E. Kelley.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt good,‚Äù said Steven Bochco, holding the most recent headshot of Adrian.

‚ÄúI guess cute kid doesn‚Äôt equal cute adult,‚Äù said David.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just so goddamn unappealing to look at. It‚Äôs like all his features were smudged together from ten different people, but he didn't get any of the good parts. His head is too big and small at the same time. It's like he has no neck. What's going on there? If he were to wear a turtleneck, it's like a round head just atop a torso. Why do his eyes do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like they‚Äôre bulging out of his head.‚Äù

Before production began on the show's sixth season, while rehearsing out on the dry lakebed, the two producers pulled Adrian aside to tell him he would take on a more behind-the-scenes advisory role. He'd still continue his real-life detective work, which would, in turn, be used as the basis for the teleplays, but he‚Äôd no longer be in front of the camera. They brought in young talent Johnny Hallbeck to play the part of Adrian. Hallbeck, just coming off the success of a stint on *Pete and Pete* and appearing in an episode of A*re You Afraid of the Dark*, was a full head taller than Adrian and already had movie-star looks.

The show reached its highest ratings with the season six premiere. Critics and viewers noted the immediate chemistry between Johnny and Cindy. Notable TV critic Alan Brendanowitz wrote: ‚ÄúWhile *Whole-eyed Private Eye* had enough charm to warrant passive viewing, the chemistry between leads Adrian Napso and Cindy Laramie simply wasn‚Äôt there. During Cindy‚Äôs first onscreen appearance with Johnny, where the two of them go undercover as grannies in a retirement home, the chemistry was undeniable.‚Äù

First, Adrian was no longer a featured actor on the show, and not long after that, they revoked his access to the set altogether. By the time Adrian was eighteen, Johnny had slept with both Cindy and Kayleigh, and then Kayleigh and then Cindy, and then Kayleigh and Cindy together.

As the years went on, people forgot Adrian was ever Adrian at all. To the world, Johnny Hallbeck was Adrian Whole-eyed. Adrian moved to Los Angeles for a new start at being a real detective. People reinvented themselves every day, and he saw no reason he couldn't do the same.

¬†

And now, as the sun was going down over the desert and the weather began to cool, Hallbeck‚Äôs giant hand was on Adrian‚Äôs shoulder, and for the first time in years, Adrian was at the center of attention. Even by the time Adrian was sitting across from Hallbeck at the late-night diner, drinking a black coffee, Adrian couldn‚Äôt recall the active decision that led to him being there.

‚ÄúGet this,‚Äù said Hallbeck. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre filming a pilot for a new series. I play a mad scientist who‚Äôs been driven out of town for his experiments, and I decide to hole up in the Mojave desert. The main gimmick is each week, one of my freak experiments gets loose, and I have to chase it down and clean up my mess. Running into you, though, changes everything. Adrian, my agent is already on the phone. Imagine how much more hype there would be if you were involved in the pilot of this. The onscreen reunion!‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what my role would be,‚Äù said Adrian.

""We'll figure it out. Oh! You could be one of the experiments gone wrong! I'm trying to clone myself, but there's a glitch in the machine, or at the last minute, a frog jumps in and mixes with my DNA. You can be my weird little clone! I'm telling you, they‚Äôre going to love this. Sleep on it, okay? In the meantime, we‚Äôre filming some night shots at the lakebed. You‚Äôve got to come.‚Äù

Out in the desert, one could look up and see the stars in all their clarity, a sight typically denied those living in the state of California. The dry lake had been transformed into a Burning Man type of event. Hundreds of extras in different states of undress had been gathered. Some of the featured extras must have been from Hollywood, as Adrian noted they were far too appealing to the camera to be locals. There was a large wooden effigy that would serve as the symbolic sacrifice to be burned. Scattered throughout were metallic and plastic installations meant to provide the viewer with the idea that the scene was alive with activity.

On the ride over, Hallbeck had explained that during a wild dance scene, everyone in attendance was to suddenly disappear as a result of one of Halbeck‚Äôs mad experiments. Hallbeck would then spend the episode trying to find ways to bring them back.

After flirting with some of the featured extras, Hallbeck returned to Adrian.

‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm actually booked to do Rogan next week. Now, just imagine if you were there too?""

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do podcasts,‚Äù said Adrian.

‚ÄúNot yet, but you will!‚Äù

The giant studio lights activated, shining down on the extras below who danced awkwardly to nonexistent music. The director was to yell *BANG*, which would serve as the moment all in attendance were to vanish into thin air. The extras earned their 100 dollars a day salary and flailed their hearts out, and when the director yelled BA‚Äî

But the director never finished the word. Adrian watched as every extra, crewmember, grip, gaffer, actor, assistant director, security, and everyone else vanished into thin air. The lights continued to shine upon an empty lakebed. There wasn't a sound to be heard in the entire desert. Even the coyotes and insects were stunned into silence. Aware of the ever-growing ways movie magic could fool audiences, Adrian took it for an elaborate special effect. Somehow, the special effects wizards had bypassed the use of blue or green screens and made an entire set of people disappear. But why would the director disappear? As these thoughts raced through his head, the set lights began to dim, leaving Adrian utterly alone in the darkness.

He‚Äôd appreciate the solitude and serendipity of it all had he not been so dumbfounded. Everyone was gone. He walked through the empty set, afraid he was violating some personal boundaries and restrictions, but there was nothing to stop him.

The stars looked‚Ä¶wrong. He had a rudimentary understanding of astronomy, knew the names of the famous constellations, and was confident he could find his way back home based on keeping track of Polaris, but he couldn't make heads or tails of what he saw. He walked into the open desert because he didn‚Äôt know what else to do. The lack of howling coyotes did not provide him with any comfort. The silence of his surroundings was oppressive. One light in the sky shone brighter than the rest, so he followed it.

The air was cool and clean. Gone were all the familiar smells of gasoline and smog and waste. Everything here was pure. He followed the light. The moon reliably hung from the sky, but he couldn‚Äôt be sure it was where it was meant to be. The light in the sky got brighter and more prominent. Soon, all sensation ceased; all he knew was he had to get closer to that light.

The silence was eventually broken by the barking of a dog. A large dog resembling a mop ran up to Adrian and started sniffing his hand. Adrian dropped to a crouch to get to eye level with the shaggy dog. He patted the dog on the head and saw the name on its collar: *Monster*. Adrian continued his trek with a partner.

They came upon a ridge that overlooked a small valley. By this point, the light was blinding, but it was as if the light had been expecting Adrian's arrival, as it began to dim. The light was emanating from a large, spherical object hovering about two hundred meters above the valley. It didn't produce a single sound. Beyond that, the object didn't appear to be physically tangible. It at once looked like it was thousands of miles away and uncomfortably close. It looked like an object protruding towards him and like a hole cut out of the sky or the fabric of reality. Monster whimpered at the site of it.

Below the sphere, roughly two hundred bodies were floating, horizontal, and perfectly still. Adrian began recording it all with his phone, not so much to show others but to show himself the next day because he would never believe what his eyes were trying to convey to him.

Just as all the bodies had disappeared before his brain could process it, new bodies appeared all around him, almost as if they'd always been there. Six tall, slender, silky gray entities stood before him. Not knowing what else to do, he sent the video to the most recent person he‚Äôd received any messages from‚Äî Hallbeck. His phone then fell from his trembling hand. He was so paralyzed by fear that he couldn't shout, close his eyes, or turn his head away, despite wanting to do all those things simultaneously. He got the sense that the poor pup was also paralyzed into submission.

The entities circled around him. He could feel an ominous energy radiating from them. It was like the cells in his body were being rearranged. Smells became sounds, and tastes became sight.

One of the entities leaned in close to him, putting its face as close to his as possible. A slit opened up on its smooth, nearly formless face. A thin, lubed tube traveled from its mouth and into Adrian's. It began to pump his body full of gunk and chemicals, and each time his body tried to reject it, more of the substance flowed into him, overtaking blood vessels, internal organs, and cells.

He is a child, walking side by side with Marie, looking for Monster. He is celebrating his sixth birthday; his front tooth has just fallen out right before everyone at the restaurant surrounds his table to sing ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù. Overwhelmed by surprise and all the newness of not having a tooth and being a year older and loud voices closing in on him, he starts crying.

He is at the ripe old age of ninety-five. Everyone he ever knew is long dead. Life never got better. Every couple of years or so, he‚Äôd try to reinvent himself, but by the time he was fifty, he understood that he had experienced all there was to experience. He would never bungee jump or go skydiving, nor would he swim with sharks or explore a cave. All of the novelty of life had long since left him. He would wake up, eat, earn enough to pay his bills and copy and paste the next day. He never would have imagined it would carry on like this for another fifty-five years. Each time he visits a doctor, he is not only prepared for but hopeful for the news that he has an advanced sickness and only three months to live. That news never comes. He still has all his awareness.

He hasn‚Äôt had a restless sleep since eighty. Ten years of waking up with two simultaneous thoughts: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still alive,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy am I still alive?‚Äù. Death of old age doesn't seem so bad at twenty; it's still far off. Even at forty, he would be forgiven to think, ""Well, if I go in thirty or forty years, it's still a long way away,"" but at almost one hundred years of age, it fills him with dread. It is the only thing he thinks about, and each day he wakes up alive, he grows more and more paranoid and ill-tempered.

Movement returned to Adrian‚Äôs fingers. He tried to step forward, but his legs were both asleep. The sphere and gray entities had vanished. Around him, the floating bodies had dropped to the desert floor and began to wake up. Adrian saw Hallbeck among them. Monster was by Johnny‚Äôs side.

¬†

Episode 2850 of the Joe Rogan Experience was the most viewed in the history of the podcast. It was at the forty-minute mark when Johnny Hallbeck revealed to the world the footage he had filmed from his cellphone of extraterrestrials outside of Adelanto, California. The video captures the sphere and the floating bodies and stops at the first appearance of the Grays, capturing their likeness for a full two seconds before the phone falls to the floor and the recording stops.

Not only was he the most talked about man on the planet, he was a hero. A certain Marie Connoway was teaching her class of second graders when the door opened, only for Monster to run full speed at Marie and jump into her arms. Despite the years apart, the dog recognized its owner right away, just as Marie recognized her Monster. The dog had not aged a single day since going missing. Hallbeck had made arrangements with the school administration beforehand to have a camera set up in the room to film the happy reunion of the woman and her dog. The video racked up almost as many views as Hallbeck‚Äôs Joe Rogan appearance.

In the following months, Marie would become infatuated with her. They would be married by the end of the year.

For Adrian, the following months were nothing but severe pain. He'd seen doctors throughout California, and every single one of them told him his stomach was fine. But after four months of severe pain, it was not only not fine, it had ballooned in size. He had been in the middle of boiling a kettle for tea when his bulging stomach knocked the cup out of his hand to shatter on the kitchen floor. He was in so much pain he couldn‚Äôt even go for his phone. He dropped to the tiled kitchen floor and bit down on his wrist, trying to refocus the pain.

His stomach kept growing. He could feel a hole forming in his body, right above the pubic region. He pushed and pushed, on the verge of passing out and popping multiple blood vessels. He pushed and sweat and screamed. A small, gray hand came out of the hole above his pubic region. It was followed by a second gray hand. The hands, using his body as leverage, pulled the rest of the body out.

Adrian had just given birth. The baby was already standing, looking the parent who had just given birth to it directly in the eyes. It had an off-gray skin color, some fuzz on the top of its head, and large eyes that Adrian immediately recognized as his own. How could it be standing on its own two feet already? It examined Adrian, tilting its head the way a dog might to get a better look. It stepped over Adrian‚Äôs body, lay between his arm and chest, and nestled its little head on its parent‚Äôs chest.

Adrian wanted to scream but didn't want to wake it up. He felt a desire to care for the thing as well as a desire to run as far as he could and never turn back. Could he possibly raise this thing? What name could ever do it justice? He'd never felt more exposed in his life, nor a bigger physical revulsion, but that revulsion was soon overpowered by guilt. He felt a deep shame that he was so afraid and disgusted by his own child. Soon, fear and confusion disappeared, and only hunger remained. He had never been so famished before, and the only thing that would whet his appetite was shawarma.

I had given him $40 for the help and to cover gas for driving me. When we got back to my place his girlfriend had made a comment about getting my dad to come help (take things in) and then told my brother to stay in the car instead of helping me take things inside. I felt SUPER caught off guard about this he turned to ask me if I needed help, she again said ‚Äústay in the car‚Äù I just said out of anger ‚ÄúI got it‚Äù grabbed all my shit and juggled it in my arms and got out. I‚Äôm VERY annoyed and want to say something but don‚Äôt really know how to approach the subject without being a bitch. I expected help especially since I paid for their coffees plus paid him $40 for help. 

How do I set the boundary that if I pay for help I expect that it be until the end and make a comment about what she said was uncalled for an inappropriate considering I PAID for him to help me. It makes me never want to ask for or help them again. ",1,1732762027.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I'm married to my long-term partner (NB27) and engaged to my fianc√© (M31) but I'm looking for something new!

Some of my interests: 
Board games (like a huge variety), cats, music, crystals, tattoos, piercings, unhinged memes, TikTok, coffee/energy drinks and reading (horror and smut specifically) 

About me:
I have brown hair typically but I do love dying my hair. Hazel eyes that get called pretty often. I'm a hopeless romantic who loves to cuddle, go on cute dates, send sweet memes/TikToks, I'm loyal and empathetic (almost to a fault), I cannot stand dry conversations, I tend to wear shorts and t-shirts because they're comfy. I'm not religious and very liberal. I'm also a mom! 

What I'm looking for: 
I would love someone who will let me be clingy, respond in a timely manner (or let me know that you're away/busy), have a dark sense of humor, and is open and honest, I tend to prefer thick body types but I'm more into your personality. 

I'm currently looking for online and long-term, but I'd love some new friends, and would be interested in-person if we hit it off, dms are open! ‚ô•Ô∏è",3,1732761895.0,polyamoryR4R,2,1.0,False

1h1lrjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/1h1lrjz/lumbar_puncture_my_experience_positive/,Lumbar Puncture - My Experience (positive) ,"Hi everyone,  
I thought it might be helpful to share my experience with getting a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) for those who still need to go through the procedure. Hopefully, this will help ease some of the anxiety you might be feeling.

Before I had the procedure, I looked up everything that could possibly go wrong, read through forums, and prepared for the worst. Needless to say, I was *terrified*.

Here's how it went:

**Preparation:**  
In the days leading up to the procedure, I made sure to prepare everything to create a cozy, stress-free environment for myself at home. I cleaned my bedroom, changed the bed sheets, bought myself flowers, and prepped healthy meals that I could easily heat up in the microwave. I also cut up lots of fruit (oranges, apples, etc.), stocked up on Hydralyte drinks, and kept about 10 bottles of water (1.5L each) within arm's reach of my bed. I also made sure I had pain medications (like ibuprofen) on hand, a phone charger, and plenty of things to keep me occupied, such as books, my laptop, and prepped podcasts to listen to.

**The Day of the Procedure:**  
I was very fortunate to have a friend drive me to the hospital and back home afterward. If you don't have anyone who can help, I definitely recommend booking an Uber or taxi. You won‚Äôt be able to drive yourself afterward, and attempting to do so could lead to complications. We were at the hospital from 1:30 PM to around 4:00 PM.

I was absolutely terrified and, as someone who already has an anxiety disorder, I was far from relaxed. But it‚Äôs important to remain as calm as possible during the procedure, as moving can increase the risk of complications.

I‚Äôm not a fan of taking medication, but I knew I needed something to help calm my nerves. If you feel the same, I highly recommend discussing it with your care team beforehand. I called them before the procedure and let them know about my anxiety. They gave me a 5mg Valium tablet (which I‚Äôd never taken before), and I think it was a lifesaver. It helped me relax my muscles and calm down. The doctor who performed the procedure was wonderful‚Äîvery calm, patient, and reassuring. He mentioned I was his fifth lumbar puncture of the day, which honestly helped to ease my anxiety (or was it the Valium? üòÖ).

**The Procedure:**  
I had to lie on my side in a fetal position. Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask the doctor if you need to adjust your position to make it easier for them. If you‚Äôre overweight, it might be harder to find the right spot, so try to assist them as best as you can. I‚Äôm fairly slim, but I still had to adjust my position a couple of times to help the doctor find the right spot.

Once they found it, the doctor placed a piece of clear foil on my back (I felt a bit like an early Christmas present, haha, definitely the Valium at work!). Then, they inserted a needle with an anaesthetic. It wasn‚Äôt painful, but it was definitely uncomfortable. I couldn‚Äôt see what was happening, and it felt like the needle was going deep into my back. The doctor pulled it out and repositioned it, going a little deeper this time. It wasn‚Äôt painful, just uncomfortable. After I told him it hurt a little, he adjusted it and it was fine.

Suddenly he said, ‚ÄúYep, that‚Äôs the right spot. We‚Äôre starting to drain the fluid. The worst is over.‚Äù I was honestly in shock. I still thought he was putting the anaesthetic into my body but apparently it was already the real deal. It all went so quick!!!  All that anxiety, all the anticipation, just for *this*? It wasn‚Äôt bad at all! I‚Äôve never had acupuncture, but I imagine it might feel something like that. On a pain scale from 1 to 10, I would rate it a 3. As a comparison, when I had blood drawn and a needle put in my vein, that was more of a 5 (it really hurt!). I'm such a baby when it comes to blood tests.

I didn‚Äôt even feel the needle coming out. I asked the doctor if it was out, and he just smiled and said, ‚ÄúGuess!‚Äù It was out.

**Recovery:**  
After the procedure, I had to lie flat on my back for an hour in the hospital bed. During that time, I listened to meditations to calm my system down. I also asked for a medical certificate for work. I‚Äôd read that you're supposed to rest for at least 24-48 hours after a lumbar puncture (and my neurologist had told me I wouldn‚Äôt be able to return to work the next day), but they only gave me a certificate for the day of the procedure. They suggested I return to work the following day, which didn‚Äôt seem reasonable to me. Please advocate for yourselves! I stood up for myself and asked for a full week off. They refused but at least agreed to give me a certificate for the next day, so I immediately booked a phone appointment with my GP to get a certificate for the rest of the week. 

**Post-Procedure Care:**  
After lying down for about 45 minutes, they tried to get me out of bed. Be sure to advocate for yourself here too - apparently it's really important to stay lying down for at least an hour after the procedure. The hospital staff was lovely, but they obs are constantly on a tight schedule.

Once I was allowed to sit up, I walked with my friend to her car, gulped down a coffee with a double shot and then lay down in the back for the 40-minute drive home. I didn‚Äôt experience a headache or pain at any point.

At home, I went straight to bed, drank a lot of fluids and rested. I stayed in bed for the next 24 hours, trying to sleep as much as possible. For the first night, I tried to lie on my back, but after that, I alternated between my back and side, being careful to keep my spine straight. I drank at least 4 liters of water a day, nourished my body with healthy meals and I only got up to use the bathroom or heat up food. I took it easy and stayed in bed for 48 hours even though I felt absolutely fine after the hospital.

**Conclusion:**  
In the end, my experience with the lumbar puncture was very positive. It was an optional procedure for me but I wanted to make sure my neurologist had everything they needed for an accurate diagnosis.

**Takeaways:**

* Prepare your space at home: Make it cozy, have healthy food and snacks, plenty of water, pain medication (just in case), coffee and fruits available
* If you have anxiety, ask for something to help relax you before the procedure (I got Valium)
* Rest for at least 48 hours after the procedure. Stay flat, only get up to go to the bathroom & for food
* Make sure someone is nearby who understands what you‚Äôre going through, just in case complications arise
* Take at least two days off work to relax and recover

That was my personal experience with the lumbar puncture. Good luck to everyone who has to undergo one in the future - remember, many people go through this procedure, even babies, and the chance of complications is very slim if you're prepared and take care of your body afterward ",8,1732761176.0,MultipleSclerosis,3,1.0,False

It is bold of me to assume I'll start doing everything I've ever wanted to do with money as a barrier to entry, but I can start by doing the free things even though I'd love to do it with manicured nails inside my dream apartment LOL. But I CAN change the dream though. Or not have one at all!! :)",1,1732760589.0,self,0,0.99,False

been living with who i think is the love of my life for the last 3 years to which im deeply grateful as its been a hell of a beautiful journey,
last year our nearly 2 year old cat passed away and i haven‚Äôt been the same ever since, i had the chance to grieve before as the pandemic took both my grandparents that were still alive but nothing like losing a child like figure to me, my cat was my world.
this year we opened the doors to our house to a dear friend who needed a place to stay, things are going kind of ok, but i don‚Äôt feel like going through another year with him as it has weakened my relationship with my fianc√©e and us not really clicking, now i don‚Äôt know how to speak to him about this and it‚Äôs really troubling me.
not really going through my best of times with my partner and it‚Äôs been tough, having to reach for deep patience somedays not to throw everything away, not really having a meaningful conflict but wearing us down in the long run.
putting all of my external things aside, i feel extremely frustrated about my life choices, battling a severe weed addiction, somedays forgeting a lot of important things, reaching for it again just to feel numb and dont think about all of this things, multiple times a day everyday, just wanting to feel faded, like im not even here, having a mediocre job as a guy in a coffee store, not going anywhere with my career choice as an artist, feeling like im not enough for anything or anyone, somedays i don‚Äôt even want to feel anymore, i just want to stop thinking, maybe even just let go of my life,
i know my troubles aren‚Äôt that big, i know i can make a change in my life but i know i won‚Äôt be changing the way i feel about myself and thats wearing down all my close relationships
sometimes i wanna let go of my dream of living off my art, maybe someday it‚Äôll make me feel better even tho i know it will break my heart
i don‚Äôt even know about anything anymore.
anyway thanks for the space, if anyone is reading this hope you aren‚Äôt feeling as shit as i do",1,1732760445.0,FeelingDown,1,1.0,False

1h1lhym,https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1h1lhym/overcoming_notebooklm_limitations_for_learning/,Overcoming NotebookLM Limitations for Learning,"Hi, just wanna share my experience with NotebookLM, likely most of you have also faced similar frustrations. No doubt its a great tool but over time, I have realized its more suited for research than actual learning. 

Here are the major issues I encountered and how I found a workaround.

**1. One Podcast Per Notebook**

The truth is trying to compress several notes into a single podcast is not practical, because so much important details will be lost, which is extremely counter-productive and the other option of creating separate notebooks for each chapter of same book, only further complicates study revisions. But with MemflixAI, every notebook is broken into multiple related chapters, with each chapter linked to its own resources (like documents, text, videos, etc.). Plus, each of these same chapters, can play multiple types of podcasts like interviews, debates or motivations.

**Before going to the next, feel free to listen to some of the MemflixAI generated podcasts and share your feedback, thanks!**

**2. No Built-In Podcast Player**

It‚Äôs one thing to manually download podcasts every time, but it‚Äôs an even bigger hassle to later organize them into related collections and playlists. MemflixAI solves this problem with a built-in player that automatically syncs your podcasts with your notes, allowing you to play them seamlessly in the background while you're on the go.

**3. Limited Podcast Styles & English-Only**

The two-host chit-chat format in NotebookLM felt limiting for me. I personally prefer more dynamic formats, of which MemflixAI offers a wider range of engaging options, including host-guest interview sessions, heated debates for balanced understanding, and much more. Additionally, it supports over 140 languages and even offers multiple accents within the same language, with voices graded by percentages based on their refinement, providing a more authentic listening experience. For best results, select voices graded 100% refined.

**4. No Flashcard Support**

What good is learning without revision? It‚Äôs the most practical way to retain knowledge. Learning without revision is like pouring water into a basket‚Äînothing sticks. In MemflixAI, when you upload your source materials, it automatically generates study guides and flashcards from your notes with support for spaced repetition to enhance knowledge retention. It also features a scoring assistant to grade your answers and a knowledge assistant to clarify areas you want to dive deeper for better understanding.

**5. Limited Interactivity**

The default Q&A feature in NotebookLM is too basic and lacks depth. In contrast, MemflixAI offers a more interactive experience, providing multiple variations of open-ended questions, multiple-choice quizzes, follow-up interview questions, and even evaluating and correcting my responses. This has made my study sessions more effective.

**6. No Progress Tracking**

Without a way to track my progress or set reminders, staying motivated was challenging. MemflixAI solves this with built-in progress tracking, goal-setting tools, and reminders that keep me on track. These have been indispensable in helping me stay focused and motivated throughout my learning sessions.

**7. No Mobile App**

NotebookLM is web-only, which made studying on the go a real challenge for me. As someone who loves to learn while commuting or during downtime, this was a major inconvenience but with MemflixAI, the mobile app has been a game-changer. I can access all my learning resources anytime, whether I‚Äôm at home, on the bus, or even in a coffee shop. It‚Äôs incredibly convenient and has made my learning routine more flexible.

**And the best part? It‚Äôs FREE! and available on both App Store and Play Store.**

If anyone has faced similar limitations with NotebookLM or has tried MemflixAI, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts! üòä

Everyone always says DONT DO IT. But I want to, so badly... and I know quite a few people who do it and make good money... but yet people who are not in it often tell me about how bad an idea it is..... 

So I'm looking for more opinions on life as a boutique owner/cafe owner.

My friend has a baby that‚Äôs 5 months older than my daughter. Her son is a little over 1 and my daughter is 9 months old.

She called me on Monday and asked me to watch her son on Wednesday from 10 am - 1 pm. She told me she would pay me and she was desperate because her, the father and her mother were either working or busy. I said of course I would be honored to watch him but didn‚Äôt really reply about her paying me bc I didn‚Äôt know what to say. 

Prior to this, I‚Äôve been posting babysitting ads trying to make some of my own income. I am a stay at home mom with no support from family other than my boyfriend, my daughter‚Äôs father. 

Wednesday comes - I watch her son at her house with my daughter. It‚Äôs going great but then an hour or so in it becomes not an ideal situation bc the father decided to come to the house with his friend (they were supposed to be in the city that day running errands) and there two dogs are running around knocking over my daughter and causing havoc and the father of the boy and his friend are playing loud music so the babies are overstimulated. Nap time comes her son is screaming bc he wants his father but his father has to leave by nap time. I end up staying an hour later on my own accord bc I finally get him and my daughter to both nap so I don‚Äôt want to disturb my daughters nap. the boys father comes back around 1 when he was supposed too but my daughter and I end up leaving at 2. I would not be expected to be paid at all from 1-2 as I stayed on my own! 

After I left , her and I texted a bit - I updated her on her son etc. and she asked for my Venmo and I didn‚Äôt reply to the Venmo part bc I was busy but I replied to other stuff about her son. So she said something like let me atleast pay you enough for a coffee or something so when I was freed up I sent the Venmo but said something like ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt feel like you have to pay me a lot or what you would pay a babysitter. I want to say I 100% will do it for free but I could really use the extra money right now. When im in a better position I‚Äôll watch him for free all the time of course!‚Äù

She paid me for watching him fairly. more than what I would of wanted or asked for but I just feel so guilty accepting the money bc I consider him like a nephew. even though I need the funds desperately and she offered to pay. I still feel guilty like I made watching her child a business transaction. When It wasn‚Äôt totally that bc I loved spending time with him and seeing the two babies play. I hope she doesn‚Äôt think I just care about the money. Ugh am I over thinking it? Have you ever asked a close friend for money for babysitting there child?
