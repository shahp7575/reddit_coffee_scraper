I've tried every method on earth now to get better. I go to therapy once a week, I'm on my third pill now (this one has given me the best results yet), I changed (most of) my habits, I talk to people more often, I make realistic goals, I am doing great on my work and I'm making more money than ever. And still, all I can think about is when is everything going to end. 

Everything is hard. I work from home now but just getting up in the morning to take a shower and make my coffee is like climbing mount Everest. Putting a smile on my face to work is like carving a new wound on my body. All I want to do is absolutely nothing. Forever. 

I feel numb but at the same time relief to be finally able to say I've tried it all and nothing worked. I'm just this way and there's nothing I can do. ",1,1764785968.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I’m a travel planner using an AI-based trip planner (SearchSpot.ai), and I recently put together a 7-day Bali honeymoon for an Indian couple traveling Dec 1–8. Thought I’d share the outline here to get feedback from people who know Bali well and to help anyone planning something similar.​

**Context (Dec Honeymoon, Indian couple):**

* Visa: Indian citizens can do Visa on Arrival; process is straightforward.
* Safety: General “use normal caution” type of situation, nothing unusual flagged.
* Weather: Early December = rainy season, so expecting humid days, afternoon downpours, but usually decent mornings and very green scenery.
* Crowds: December is peak season, but they’re going in the first week, so they’ll catch the festive vibe without the absolute Christmas–New Year crush.​

**Overall Strategy:**  
Go for a “Classic Romance” split stay: 4 nights in Seminyak (beach, sunsets, food, spas) + 3 nights in Ubud (jungle, temples, rice terraces, slower pace). The idea is to plan core activities in the mornings, leave space for spa/relaxation in the afternoons in case of rain, and avoid too many long transfers​

  


# Itinerary Outline (7 Days – Classic Romance)

**Day 1 – Arrival in Bali → Seminyak**

* Arrive, Visa on Arrival, hotel check-in at a romantic 5-star in Seminyak (shortlist: beachfront / pool-access / honeymoon-style resort).
* Easy evening: walk on Seminyak Beach, sunset cocktails at a beach club, relaxed dinner nearby.[seminyak.montigoresorts+1](https://seminyak.montigoresorts.com/resources/-seminyak-romantic-things-to-do-on-a-budget)​

**Day 2 – Seminyak: Beach, Spa, Romantic Dinner**

* Lazy morning by the pool or beach.
* Afternoon couple’s spa (massage + flower bath type setup).
* Romantic dinner by the beach in Seminyak (aiming for one of those “table for two under the stars” style places).[villa-bali+1](https://www.villa-bali.com/guide/romantic-activities-bali-budgets/)​

**Day 3 – Day Trip (Tanah Lot / Uluwatu Option)**  
Option A:

* Morning trip to Tanah Lot Temple for views and photos.
* Back to Seminyak for shopping/cafes and another sunset on the beach.

Option B:

* Half-day down to Uluwatu: cliffside views, maybe a beach stop, then back to Seminyak for dinner.[jetsetchristina+1](https://www.jetsetchristina.com/the-ultimate-bali-honeymoon-guide/)​

**Day 4 – Free Day in Seminyak**

* Keep it flexible: more spa time, brunch spots, sunset beach club, or just chilling at the resort.
* Backup plan: if earlier days get rained out, use this day to shift activities.[seminyak.montigoresorts+1](https://seminyak.montigoresorts.com/resources/-seminyak-romantic-things-to-do-on-a-budget)​

  


**Day 5 – Transfer to Ubud + First Ubud Evening**

* Morning checkout from Seminyak and drive to Ubud.
* Check into a jungle-view or rice-terrace-view villa (ideally private pool or at least very “honeymoon” focused).
* Evening in central Ubud: stroll the town, casual dinner, maybe a quiet drink.[dimaak+1](https://dimaak.com/blog/bali-itinerary/)​

**Day 6 – Ubud Highlights (Nature & Culture)**

* Full-day Ubud area tour: a mix of waterfalls, rice terraces, and temples. Example combo:
   * Tegalalang Rice Terrace
   * A couple of nearby waterfalls (like Tibumana / Kanto Lampo)
   * One water/heritage temple stop
* Back to the villa in the late afternoon; evening to relax.[viator+1](https://www.viator.com/en-IN/tours/Ubud/Best-of-Ubud-Attractions-Waterfalls-Temples-and-Rice-Terraces/d5467-11769P47)​

**Day 7 – Slow Ubud Day + Departure Prep**

* Easy morning: yoga at the hotel or a nearby studio, coffee with a view, last-minute shopping.
* Depending on flight time: either head straight to the airport or fit in a short spa session or cafe stop.[happytovisit+1](https://happytovisit.com/ubud-top-attractions-waterfalls-temples-and-rice-terraces/)​",1,1764785842.0,baliitinerary,0,1.0,False

1pdbsnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dtc/comments/1pdbsnt/creative_ways_to_build_loyalty_when_your_beans/,Creative ways to build loyalty when your beans are everywhere,"For roasters who sell through a bunch of stores, loyalty gets weird. You want repeat customers, but you don’t control the checkout, you don’t get emails, and half the time you don’t even know who bought the bag. But some brands are getting really creative about keeping people in their orbit.

Here are a few ideas that seem to work:

### “Scan the bag” rewards
Simple QR inside or outside the bag that lets customers join a loyalty program no matter where they bought it. Could be stamps, points, or perks. Something tiny that encourages the second purchase.
If you want a simple tool for that kind of thing, CHCKN has a version of this: https://chckn.club

### Seasonal perks
Offer something fun like double stamps in January or a “try a new origin” bonus in summer. It gives people a reason to stick with your brand instead of switching to the next bag on the shelf.

### Shelf-side mini stories
Some roasters add tasting guides or quick notes about the farm or roast process. It sounds simple, but people love this stuff. It builds vibe and trust. Easy for a store to print and stick up too.

### Retailer-specific blends / collabs
Create small runs for certain stores. Gives your wholesale partners something special and gives customers a reason to return to that exact location for “their” blend.

### Loyalty linked to subscriptions
Even if the first purchase is in a store, give people a clean path to become subscribers later. A QR that drops them onto a simple “subscribe for perks” page. Make the leap frictionless.

If you’re curious about how loyalty looks for coffee brands that don’t own the checkout experience, CHCKN has a quick explainer on multi-location loyalty:
https://chckn.app/magazine/for-roasters

How are you building loyalty when your beans live in grocery stores or cafés? Anything that actually kept people coming back? Any experiments you want to try?",1,1764785611.0,dtc,0,1.0,False

On the outside, Hydro Flask is the best brand I've found.  Remarkably durable and functional, and the temperature control is second-to-none.  My only complaint has been the lack of ceramic lining for the bottles.  I was ecstatic to learn about the wine bottle...



[https://www.hydroflask.com/25-oz-ceramic-wine-bottle?color=Surf](https://www.hydroflask.com/25-oz-ceramic-wine-bottle?color=Surf)



Bought without hesitation, and it does not disappoint.  I am not a wine drinker.  I bought this for coffee.  I've got a one-hour train ride & walk every morning, and there is nothing like that first sip when I get to work.  With this bottle, my coffee is super hot and it tastes like I just poured.



Before this I tried four or five other brands, and the heat retention was horrible in all of them.  I recommend this without hesitation for the temperature performance alone.  However, if you're listening Hydro Flask folks, I do have a small complajnt and a big ask.



First, the cap sucks.  The ultra smooth stainless finish makes it very difficult to loosen.  I'm assuming the bottle is compatible with your small mouth cap, and I have one on order.  Something with better grip would be a huge plus.



Second, more ceramic lining!  I've got three larger bottles, and I'll be first in line to buy when you start offering more bottles with ceramic lining.  Please make the user experience even better by ensuring the taste matches the look and durability.

A single act of neglect or violation of trust is sufficient to render a stock worthless. The primary mission of the analyst is to flush out and denounce questionable securities promises out of the savings-capital circuit, and thus safe-keep investors' savings for sounder cash flow rich wealth-producing businesses***. 



# 1-Red Flag: TryHard Holdings ( THH) the Japanese join the game!



[ Tiny Coffee shop selling for $800M on the Nasdaq! ](https://preview.redd.it/hq05spa9v05g1.png?width=3033&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa66d376e2db104556a6f0a1499cacd24d94eab3)

TryHard Holdings (THH) presents a high-risk, speculative investment profile due to its significant insider ownership (52.85%), negligible institutional stake (0.22%), limited public float (20.66M), and extremely high valuation ratios (P/E 7,358.55), coupled with a history of extreme price volatility. 

Its low revenue and minimal profit fail to justify its current market capitalization. These characteristics suggest a potential micro-cap stock manipulation scheme, where controlling shareholders may potentially inflate the stock price through artificial means before selling their shares at a profit, leaving public investors with substantial losses.

**THH relationship with Tiger Securities, a renowned issuer of junky IPOs, further undermines its reliability and trustworthiness.**

  




# 2-Ambitions Enterprise Management Co. L.L.C (AHMA) 

Based on my analysis of the company's profile, financial metrics, recent stock performance, IPO structure, and the history of its underwriters, **Ambitions Enterprise Management Co. L.L.C. (AHMA)** exhibits several significant **red flags** characteristic of high-risk, speculative micro-cap stocks, including indicators suggesting a potential **insider self-enrichment scheme or pump-and-dump operation**.

[Business village is a hub for business incubation supported by the government. ](https://preview.redd.it/8w1q9mjv315g1.png?width=3936&format=png&auto=webp&s=283956b75b9e9f4300a37c226f8406039fa19f6c)

  


*Its highly developed financial infrastructure and deficiencies in anti-money laundering regulations make Dubai one of the largest hubs for all types of money laundering, including trade-based money laundering and money laundering through gold and real estate.*

*George Mason University.*  


#  AHMA Company and Financial Red Flags.

The structure and financial performance of AHMA raise immediate concerns:

* **Small, Recent IPO and Extreme Volatility:** AHMA conducted its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in October 2025, raising only $6.9 million.
* . Since then, the stock has experienced massive volatility, as evidenced by the page data showing a **+24.90%** daily increase and a 52-Week Range of **$4.00 to $18.20** shortly after its $4.00 IPO price. Such extreme, rapid, and short-term price movements are a key characteristic of pump-and-dump manipulation in low-float, micro-cap stocks.
* **Small Market Cap and Low Revenue:** With a Market Cap of **$474.62M** and trailing twelve-month (ttm) Revenue of only **$18.54M**, the stock's valuation appears stretched for its revenue base, especially in the volatile **Travel Services** industry \[Source: current page\].
* **High P/E Ratio:** A P/E Ratio of **402.27** based on an EPS (ttm) of only **$0.03** suggests the market is pricing in enormous, perhaps unrealistic, growth expectations, or it is a sign of an artificially inflated price \[Source: current page\].
* **Holding Company Structure:** The company is a Cayman Islands holding company, with operations conducted by its subsidiaries in the UAE. This structure adds layers of complexity and opacity for U.S. investors, making due diligence and asset recovery more difficult.
* **Voting Control (Insider Self-Enrichment Risk):** The share structure features Class A (1 vote per share) and Class B (15 votes per share) shares. The founder, Zhengang Tang, beneficially holds a massive amount of Class B shares, resulting in an aggregate voting power of approximately **69.75%** post-IPO. This **super-voting** structure ensures that insiders maintain complete control, allowing them to make critical decisions, including capital allocation or related-party transactions, without significant accountability to public shareholders (Class A holders), a severe risk for potential self-enrichment.

**The Underwriters: AC Sunshine Securities LLC and Univest Securities, LLC**.

The choice of underwriters is a crucial indicator of IPO quality, and here, it presents a significant red flag. **AC Sunshine Securities LLC** and **Univest Securities, LLC** served as joint bookrunners.

* **Focus on Micro-Cap/Foreign Issuers:** 
* Univest Securities, LLC has been involved in IPOs for other small-cap companies, often foreign issuers like **Yoshitsu Co., Ltd (TKLF)**, **Jianzhi Education Technology Group (JZ)**, and **Lichen China Limited (LICN)**. Many firms that specialize in these smaller, highly volatile foreign micro-cap IPOs have a track record associated with poor post-IPO stock performance, which is a classic precursor to ""failed"" or ""mediocre"" stock issues and an environment conducive to manipulation.
* **Underwriter Compensation:** The underwriting agreement includes standard compensation but also specifies the issuance of **Representative's Warrants** to AC Sunshine Securities LLC and Univest Securities LLC, exercisable at a 120% premium to the IPO price ($4.80). These warrants give the underwriters a direct financial stake in the initial price appreciation, which incentivizes them to maximize the initial IPO price, regardless of the long-term fundamentals, further aligning their interests with short-term speculative gains typical of a pump-and-dump environment.

#  Conclusion on Risk Profile

AHMA exhibits a combination of structural and market-driven red flags strongly associated with speculative or manipulative trading schemes:

* **Low Float/Micro-Cap Status + Extreme Volatility:** Ideal conditions for price manipulation (pump-and-dump).
* **Highly Concentrated Insider Control (Dual-Class Shares):** Facilitates **insider self-enrichment** by minimizing external shareholder governance and accountability.
* **Underwriter Profile:** Association with smaller, often volatile foreign IPOs that frequently underperform post-debut.

As a securities analyst, I would classify AHMA as a **Highly Speculative Investment** with an **Elevated Risk of Market Manipulation and Insider Scheme**. Investors should exercise extreme caution and consider this a potential capital loss risk.

I started law school in 2018 and went in assuming it would be the hardest thing I'd ever done to that point in my life. I was not a good student in college but managed to get into a decent law school (it was close to T20 at the time but I think has slipped quite a bit) with a decent scholarship off a high LSAT score and some decent extracurriculars. My first semester I studied harder than I ever had, took more notes than I ever had, and walked away with straight B's. I was pretty disappointed by the result, and a lot of the talk from the big law crowd about how those were the most important grades really deflated me (I didn't particularly want to go into big law but that was just the people I was surrounded by). After that I didn't crack the books open very much, listened in class without taking notes, and embarrassingly copped to not having read anything pretty much anytime I was cold called. For whatever reason my grades improved dramatically and I mostly got A's from that point and ended up graduating with honors.

I enjoyed getting higher grades, but that didn't translate into success finding internships during summers. I had only a 1L summer internship and nothing after that, in part because of COVID and in part because I could not get an interview anywhere I applied, and without much to add to my resume I felt pretty doomed and didn't put much effort toward bar prep. About 2 weeks before the bar exam the panic set in that I had not studied at all. I crammed a good bit but only made it through maybe two-thirds of the lectures I had purchased through the prep course and none of the prep tests. I still managed to pass and later took a job at the only firm I got an offer from, which was the only firm that asked to interview me. The job pays OK (I would say excellent if I lived in a less expensive region), and based on the bonuses and feedback I've gotten no one has much to criticize about my work, but the work is dull, not very stimulating, and not really a meaningful opportunity to help other people while not affording me much free time to pursue pro bono opportunities, though I probably would not feel competent to take on pro bono work even if I had the time. I thought it would be an OK place to start my career, but not only have I struggled to even get an interview elsewhere, no one with a job I'm interested in is willing to get a coffee or exchange emails to chat about how they got that job.

The net result of all this is that I don't tell people I'm a lawyer in my personal life because it doesn't feel like something I've worked very hard for, I don't feel like it's something I'm using to help other people, and when I reach out to other practitioners for some career guidance they ignore my emails so I don't exactly feel respected as anyone's peer either. My law degree is still in the box it shipped in. Anyone else find themselves hiding their profession from people in your personal life?",1,1764785409.0,Lawyertalk,5,0.6,False

What have I noticed so far

For most of my adult life I didn’t realise how overstimulated, exhausted, and disconnected I actually was. I thought stress, chaos, and survival mode were normal. I didn’t know what it felt like to have a regulated nervous system because I’d never had one. The caffeine, nicotine, Pepsi Max, TikTok, weed, alcohol.. all of it was part of a cycle I used to keep myself going, numb myself out, or escape from whatever felt too heavy to sit with.

In May 2025, I made one decision that changed everything: I quietly started cutting things out, one by one. No “new year, new me.” Just honesty.
Nicotine went first. Then coffee. Then Pepsi Max. Then weed. Then TikTok. Then alcohol. Every time I removed something, I found a piece of myself underneath it that I didn’t even know was missing.

The detox wasn’t glamorous. It was uncomfortable. I had days where my emotions came in waves, because I was finally feeling them without numbing them. But somewhere in the middle of all that discomfort, something shifted. My mind became clearer. I could actually sit still. I wasn’t reacting from panic anymore. I wasn’t controlled by habits, cravings, or the next dopamine hit.

My nervous system finally calmed down after more than a decade of living on high-alert.

Today, I feel like an adult for the first time in my life.. not because I suddenly have everything figured out, but because I finally have a relationship with myself that isn’t built on distraction or escape. I can think. I can choose. I can regulate. I can feel without falling apart.

This dopamine detox didn’t just change my habits basically changed my entire baseline.
I’m present. I’m intentional. I’m no longer owned by my impulses.

I’m finally living my life instead of running from it. Oh and I can read books, something I thought I was incapable of. 🤪

- No more hunger pangs, just fatigued sometimes
- Taking electrolytes but cutting the dosage a bit since that seems to work best for me 
- Days 1-5 sucked, just tried to rest as much as possible
- Walking 2-3 miles a day when possible but not forcing it 
- Drinking water, black coffee with 1tbs butter in the morning and Coke Zero for the most part. The coffee+butter I think makes the most difference for hunger.

I started talking in college for 1-2 months but then I learned it's not correct as per Islam (intention was not marriage).

Now the thing is that some women here in Germany have shown interest, one time I was stopped while walking down the street and the beautiful mid 30s woman asked how did the coffee taste that I was carrying. I said it's fine and didn't interest her more than that ( I am naturally very harsh or ignorant of women). Multiple women at work has shown interest and again I didn't give af.

Every step reminded me that this laptop was forged by demons:
the BIOS is locked with iron chains — no undervolt, no DVMT, no nothing.
Just pain.

Bro vanished like a Hackintosh ghost.

I kept digging through ancient Samsung/Hackintosh posts from people who tried this same Coffee Lake-H machine 5 years ago… and vanished.
Bought a $70 WD Blue for macOS (Yep… it took that ⁦).
After endless ACPI tweaks and zero sleep, OpenCore finally booted.
Sequoia installed.
For a second, I felt alive.

…then reality slapped me.

The digaster is Intel UHD 630? Sequoia basically said:
“Acceleration? On THIS? lol no.”

Every ig-platform-id in the database got tested:

correct value → instant crash

wrong value → boots but 0 acceleration (4K slideshow mode at 0.5 FPS 💀)


I found u/dotnetian through on same this hell.

All this suffering just for macOS UI and Xcode.

So yeah… my Hackintosh arc ends here(probably). I will return to windows and the ugly ui lol.

• i’m sleepy 90% of the time, functioning purely on iced coffee, will yawn mid-rant but continue the rant anyway.
• i’m daintily inked — tiny tattoos... big personality.
• chronically online, sarcastic-mouthed, and a certified yap machine once comfortable.
• i send memes, poetry, unhinged theories, and occasionally emotional depth out of nowhere.

looking for someone who:
	•	can YAP back with equal enthusiasm
	•	is also chronically online (pls… it is VITAL)
	•	can match chaotic banter but also lean into softness
	•	enjoys late-night voice notes, random thoughts, and unnecessary debates
	•	can keep up when i shift topics like:
“i’m hungry” → “capitalism is a scam” → “do u think clouds feel heavy?”

\- a bit bigger. Not dad-bod yet, but definitely not skinny. Working on it  
\- generic white guy in appearance  
\- stupid mustache (package deal, it's a core part of my personality now)

\- Favorite color: Purple  
\- Favorite food: Nearest  
\- How's the weather: Nice and cold  
\- Dogs or cats: Unconditionally love every dog in existence. Neutral towards cats  
\- Morning or night: depends on the day

\- Speak other languages: Korean, allegedly

\- Single mothers welcome\*  
\- be.. interesting in some way  
\- Preferably US based

I'm just a dude doing all a dude can do, really. Been single for... entirely too long. Anyway. I spend my free time listening to music and playing video games. What music? Mostly divorced dad rock, but my playlist has been described as musical whiplash before. What games? Simulators. Sometimes something else, but generally sims. What platform? PC. Yes we could probably play together.

Ideally, in person. Open to long distance, though.

Bad at small talk, even worse at talking about myself sometimes. I try, though

Uhhhhhhhh, not sure what else to put in here. At least drop me a message to give me feedback on this.

Oh yeah, left a \* up there:

\* The problem with single mothers isn't really the kid or anything, it's the father. I've given it a few earnest attempts before, but it always comes back around to that.

I could sit in a bar or coffee house for days and not a single person would say a word to me. 

I joined a group once and actually met people but it’s like I’m invited out once and never again, and I am clueless what I did to make them not want to invite me again (and I’d invite them too and they’d deny). 

At work I always get high performance grades but NEVER ONCE A PROMOTION while my co-workers move “up the ladder”.

Now that I’m older it’s like a blue moon when someone approaches me, and I’m not even saying romantically. Not a “I like your shoes”, “are you okay”, “can I pet your dog”…. nothing!!

I expected the same décor as the previous place but it had been completely gutted and brightened.  I understand it is a franchise but the owners were onsite and very involved.  The owner Ron took my order and his wife Cynthia made up the meal.

Not an extensive menu but they serve both breakfast and lunch items.  The chicken quesadilla was stacked with meat and the cinnamon rolls were amazing.   And of course if you are a coffee lover (I am not) they of course have that as well.

Loved to have seen more traffic in there so check them out if you are in the area.

1pdb5dc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_spez/comments/1pdb5dc/beyond_the_front_page_of_the_internet/,Beyond the Front Page of the Internet,"Hi everyone,

The end of the year is as good a time as any for reflection, and lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about what makes Reddit special.

When we started this site 20 years ago (AKA Very, Very Old Reddit), the goal was pretty simple: create a space where people could talk about interesting things they found on the internet. What began as an alternative to traditional media came into its own as an alternative to social media, and now that AI is everywhere, our aim is to keep Reddit the most human place on the internet. No matter what platforms or technology are trending, we’ve always strived to be a more authentic antidote.

Over the years, Reddit’s been stereotyped in all sorts of ways: shaving-challenged basement dwellers, keyboard warriors with too much time on their hands, or—more accurately—the funniest, most interesting, and helpful people on the internet. Take your pick. I’ve never liked the idea of a Reddit hivemind or archetype because Reddit’s not one thing. It never has been. Though I admit it’s always had a certain *vibe*, today even that is entirely dependent on which subreddits you hang out in.

For a long while, we were known as the “front page of the internet,” but we’ve outgrown a singular front page for everyone. You have different interests than I do, and your Reddit should look different from mine. And from your neighbor’s, or your coworker’s, or your best friend’s. Whether you’re in a community of fellow [first-time parents](https://www.reddit.com/R/NEWPARENTS), aspiring [solo travelers](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/), fans of your favorite [reality show](https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/), or people who run [ultra-marathons](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/), Reddit is home to all of it. 

Which brings us to r/popular, the default feed for new users. In theory, it’s what’s most popular on Reddit, but it’s actually what is *liked* by the most active users on Reddit—which is not the same thing. Having it as a default feed gives the false impression of a singular Reddit culture, one that is neither representative of Reddit nor appealing to new users (or anyone at all, IMO). Which is why, in the near future, we'll stop showing it to new users, and unless you read it regularly, we’ll remove it from the core group of feeds in the app. 

Said more directly: r/popular sucks, and we’re moving away from it, and towards better, more relevant and personalized feeds.

We’re one platform, yes, but with many minds (at least more than one). One of my favorite aspects of Reddit is that every community has its own culture, rules, and sense ([or lack](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/)) of humor. We are a constantly evolving ecosystem where anyone, anywhere, can connect on almost any topic or belief. And if your perspective isn’t represented, you can create the community you want to see. The freedom to build your own corner of the internet is what makes Reddit, Reddit.

On Reddit, no strongly held worldview exists unchallenged. For every earnest subreddit, there is a vibrant and more funny circlejerk counterpart lurking in the shadows. That balance—and sometimes tension—reflects how the world actually is.

More people are visiting Reddit than ever before—116 million every day. And when I look at the top-visited communities, it’s not surprising to see that they are (mostly) coming here to laugh, ask questions, judge, and generally be entertained.

*Top 20 SFW subreddits by weekly active visitors, as of November 20, 2025.*

Reddit thrives when its communities are unique. That’s why we empower them to make their own rules (on top of [ours](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules)) and grow the way they want to. But distinct communities require distinct leaders. A situation where someone moderates an unlimited number of massive communities is not that, which is why we’re making a few changes.

Namely, we’re [limiting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1pbkqbu/an_update_on_limits_for_hightraffic_communities/) the number of high-traffic communities any single person can moderate. This is a major shift with a lot of nuance, so we're not rushing. We’re focused on helping all affected mods and communities through the transition, which you can read about in detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1ncn0go/evolving_moderation_on_reddit_reshaping_boundaries/).

Relatedly, you may have noticed that we updated how we display community size. We switched from Subscribers—which was really just a measure of age—to Weekly Visitors to reflect actual activity. (And if you really miss subscribers, you can add them back with [this](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/subscriber-count) devvit app.)

These changes are all part of the same goal: making Reddit more conducive to how people actually use it today.

Reddit is for everyone because it’s built by everyone. We’re a vibrant city of coffee shops, nightclubs, arenas, and yes, a few weird basements (neckbeard not required). Sure, you can come here to argue, but like in real life, most people come here to connect. We want to help you do more of that.

Thank you to all of you who make Reddit what it is and what it can be next.

See you next year,

u/spez

**Classification String: Under Review**

**Interviewer: Christophe W.**

**Interview Date: 12/04/24**

  


When I was sixteen, I got so high that I thought I was growing scales.

I was living on Gut Street. Actually it was Gunn Street, but one afternoon this drunk driver blasted through the intersection and hit a pedestrian. It basically broke the guy in half. His legs stayed behind, but his top half got stuck under the car and his guts just kind of ribboned out across the road. 

That’s why I called it Gut Street.



I was living with my parents for the first time since grade school. I moved down to California to live with them. Not even the cool part. Like, the Turlock part. Not even Turlock itself, but—never mind.



I was so homesick. I’d dream of home — the forests, the fog, the way everything was absolutely redolent of pine — and wake up crying. 



We lived in a shitty apartment. Rats, spiders, black mold, leaky pipes, foundation issues, drug deals in the hall, the works.



The situation did have one thing going for it, though. Actually, three things. Their names were Asher, Amanda, and Jason.



They practically adopted me the day I moved in—absorbed me as if I’d always been part of them. That’s the first and only time someone did that for me.



Asher and Amanda worked off and on with my dad doing…whatever it was he did. Amanda was nineteen, and I idolized her. She was intimidatingly beautiful and just intimidating, period. Her brother Asher was eighteen and funny as hell. Looking back, he was probably the only actual friend I had.



Then there was Jason, my boyfriend. He didn’t work with my dad, but he knew Amanda really well and he lived across the hall from me. He was twenty-one, so too old to be hanging around me and definitely too old to be dating me. But I loved him.



I loved them all.



I was nothing like them, though. I knew it, which always made me feel less. Not like an outsider, but like if we ever had to cut and run, I’d be the one left in the dust.



Now, I hate anything that threatens my self-control. I spent my life suffering the consequences of people who couldn’t control themselves due to addiction. So I didn’t drink, didn’t smoke, didn’t take anything. Not even soda or candy, because some teacher convinced that sugar is addictive. I’ve eased up on the sugar, but not the rest.



Anyway, Jason, Amanda, and Asher were my polar opposites.



They smoked, they drank, they played around with harder drugs. Amanda was a dropout, Asher was about to be, and Jason was actually a small time dealer.



They all had matching tattoos that I coveted. These red, rune-looking circles on their palms. When I asked, Amanda said they were for fun. Asher said they were friendship bracelets for grownups. Jason just said they were a mistake. 



That didn’t stop me from wanting a matching mistake of my own.



They all thought my teetotaler-hood was hilarious. They made fun of me for being straight edge — that’s what they called it — and made a game of trying to trick me into taking something. Alcohol, drugs, didn’t matter. Just something. They tried to spike water, soda, coffee, tea, food. Sometimes they literally just tried to shove their fingers into my mouth. Whatever they could do, they did. I always managed to avoid it, though.



It was really fucked up, but I was too young to know better. I was just so glad to be included.



And I was definitely included. When I wasn’t at school or alone with Jason, the four of us were together. We wandered around town in the daytime and lurked in the apartment courtyard at night, kicking around and generally being assholes.



We were in the courtyard the night before school let out. The three of were trying harder than ever to get me high in order to celebrate the end of the school year. Asher had just tried — and almost succeeded — in slipping me an acid tab. I don’t even know where the hell he got it. He was even poorer than me. I was furious.



“Come on,” Asher said, “don’t be mad. I’ll make it up to you.” He looked at Amanda. “We can show her, right? Yes? *Yes*?”



“She’s going to think we’re crazy. Or she won’t see anything and then we’ll know we’re crazy.”



“We’re not crazy.” Asher held up his palm, showing the red tattoo. “If this is real, so’s the rest. Might make her a little crazy to see it, though. It did me.”



“Stop,” Jason cut in. “Right now.”



“Look at the pied piper, scolding his mice for following him in the first place,” said Asher.



“Ash, that was poetic.” I was working very hard to keep my voice calm. Excitement was bubbling up. This was it. They were talking about giving me my very own friendship bracelet. They wanted me to be one of them for real.



“The atomic bomb, the black hole, nothing at all,” Asher said. “What do you think she’ll be, Jason? You know her best, for now. Any guesses?”



“Probably a narc,” said Amanda. “The good kids are always narcs.”



“She’s not a good kid, she only pretends. I see through her.” Asher fixed me with a look I kind of hated. “You ready for your friendship bracelet?”



“I guess.”



“Don’t do it.” Jason’s voice sent a chill up my spine.



“What is ‘it’?” I asked. 



“Something nobody should do.”



“What? Is it like a trick…?”



“Yeah, but they’re not the ones playing it. *Don’t go*.”



I hesitated. 



I loved Jason. Most of the time he was the calmest, gentlest person I knew. With a couple of admittedly notable exceptions, he always did what he thought was best for me.



If he was saying to sit this out, I probably needed to listen.



But it was easy for him to say. He already had a friendship bracelet. And based on Asher’s pied piper comment, the tattoos were his idea in the first place. So why was it okay for Asher — and for Amanda — to have one, and not me?



“Why?” I asked.



Jason just shook his head and stomped off without a word.



He was always doing shit like that. It was the kind of thing my parents did. It always made me feel like I was in trouble. I hate feeling like I’m in trouble more than I hate anything, then and now. 



“Don’t worry,” Asher said. “He’s nothing.”



For some reason, this made Amanda laugh. Then she slid her arm through mine and pulled me to my feet. “Off we go, my little narc.”



Asher took my other arm and together we marched out of the courtyard and down the street.



I quickly realized we were following the very same path that poor pedestrian’s shimmering guts had painted across the asphalt. Worse, our destination was the exact culvert where the car had finally screeched to a stop, smashing what remained of the guy’s road-rashed head.



There were no signs of blood or road-rashed heads, though. Just several concentric rings of tiny purple wildflowers rippling out from the culvert.



Asher let go of my arm, dropped to his knees, and crawled inside.



Just like that, I felt embarrassed.



Worse than embarrassed. I felt that terrible, deep gut-drop that comes when you realize you’re not part of the joke, you’re just the butt of it. “Are you guys fucking with me?”



“You want your friendship bracelet or not?” Asher asked.



He vanished into the darkness. Amanda followed suit. I heard their laughter echoing down the tunnel. It was probably a trick of my teenage insecurity, but I thought their laughter sounded cruel.



So I went home.



Jason was waiting for me in the courtyard with an Arizona tea and an apology, but I waved him off. I didn’t want to deal with him. I already felt stupid. I didn’t need another lecture too.



I did take the tea, though.



I went straight to bed, but couldn’t sleep. When I don’t sleep, I think a million thoughts a minute. At that rate, some of your thoughts are necessarily stupid and dangerous.



One of the stupid, dangerous thoughts I had that night was this:



*I can go down to culvert and check for myself.* 

  


That way if Asher and Amanda were playing a trick, at least they wouldn’t see me falling for it.



I didn’t even have to sneak out. Mom was working a night shift and Dad was in his room, obsessively prepping whatever it was he did. I wasn’t scared of them anyway.



I *was* scared that Jason would somehow sense what I was doing and try to stop me, but that didn’t happen.



Outside, the street was quiet and empty. My eyes played tricks, though. I thought I saw ribbony intestines gleaming dimly under the flickering street lights. A thin, looping path marking the way to the culvert.



Without letting myself think, I got to my knees and started crawling.



The first thing that occurred to me was that it was very dark.



The second was that this was a very, very long culvert.



After crawling long enough that my hands were raw and my knees ached, I saw a pinprick of light at the other end.



It still looked impossibly far away. I thought the tunnel must have been the remnant of some prohibition era passageway. Something that led straight into a club or even a bar.



After what felt like forever, the light expanded into an exit.



But not into a bar or a club.



Right back onto Gut Street.



But everything was wrong.



Instead of dark, it was daytime. But the most beautiful daytime I’ve ever seen, more beautiful than Gut Street could ever hope to be. The full glory of autumn, all green and gold and copper. It was warm too, like a day straight out of the best dreams of your life. A cacophony of birdsong filled the air, mingling with music echoing some distance away.



Everything around me — the sidewalks, the road, the houses — looked new, clean, and somehow fresh. No dilapidation, no filth, no overflowing garbage. No garbage at all. Just a bright and shining ideal of what Gut Street might have been in another life.



Or another world.



A bird suddenly whipped overhead. I ducked — I’m afraid of birds — and whirled around. It was a bird I’ve never seen. Shimmering, pearlescent green, with this absolutely crazy beak.



I looked up into the trees.



All the birds were like that. Like tropical birds on steroids. Fairy tale birds. Some shone like gold, others like gemstones made into flesh, others like light itself with glittering black eyes.



And every last one of them sang.



“There you are!”



I jumped and saw Asher bounding down the street.



I don’t know what it was, but the sight of him triggered something primal. Not quite a fear, but an *aversion*. He was walking too fast. Each step seemed a little too light and a little too long.



But before I could think too hard, he was in front on me and then his arm was around me and then we were walking together down the shining, glimmering daydream version of our street.



“No Jason? He sure is heavy for being nothing.”



“Don’t talk about him like that.”



“Why? Afraid of what he’ll do to you?”



He sped up, pulling me along with him. But I didn’t want to speed up. I wanted, almost desperately, to look around. I actually did stop when we passed a gleaming, perfect replica of our apartment building.



Asher immediately dragged me away. “Nope. Do *not* go in there. Don’t go in any of the houses. That’s the first rule: We go only to the carnival.”



We reached the end of the street, which was dominated by a massive ticket stand that partly shielded a breathtaking midway beyond. 



Asher pulled me to the ticket window and rang the bell. “Hey!”



The ticket taker seemed to explode out of nowhere.



He was huge, built like a wrestler, with dark red hair, big bright eyes, and an unhappy mouth that turned into a smile when he saw Asher. With a twinge of unease, I saw he was twirling a large-bore needle between his fingers.



“Tickets, please, bomb boy,” he said.



“You know I got the season pass, you bastard,” Asher said mildly, holding out his palm.



The man turned that smile onto me. “Does she?”



“Not yet. Let her in.”



The ticket man looked me over, brows knitting suspiciously over those big, glittering eyes. “I’m not supposed to let dragons in. They can burn down carnivals, you know.”



“Don’t argue with me. Season passholders get free guest tickets, no limitations.”



“Says who?”



“Says me.”



“You’ve convinced me,” said the blue-eyed man, turning to me. “Give me your hand, darling.” 



I immediately decided to do no such thing, but I wasn’t given the courtesy of implementing that decision. The man reached across the counter, grabbed my hand, and stabbed it with the needle once, twice, three times.



He squeezed my palm so that blood welled, and then he lapped it up.



I couldn’t even move. You know the fight or flight response? I don’t fight *or* fly. I just freeze. I guess you know that better than anyone.



This guy sucked until it hurt, until I was ready to cry. Then he smacked his lips, licking a stray drop off the corner of his mouth. “Delicious. Dragon, definitely. Are you *sure* she’s safe?”



“Safer than you.”



“I can’t argue with that.” He waved us onward.



Asher grabbed me by my bleeding hand and dragged me through the gate.



The carnival looked amazing, just like the rest of Gut Street Behind the Culvert. But it was frightening as well, an unsettling superimposition of extreme beauty laid over the mundane familiar. I saw billowing tents in every color I could imagine and several I couldn’t, a hundred game booths with a hundred carnival barkers and hundred food stands that each smelled more delicious than the last.



Asher pulled me past every last one.



Toward the end of the midway, I saw Amanda.



Her skin glimmered with stars. Not lights — literal stars, like images from the Hubble telescope. Her eyes weren’t normal, either. Black and shot through with white, like frozen lightning.



That’s when I finally realized that I was fucking high.



It was Jason. Had to be. He’d given me the tea earlier, and like a moron I drank it. Even though I knew they were all trying to dope me up every day — even though I knew better — I took it anyway.



And you know what? Even though it pissed me off, it was like a weight fell off my shoulders, because at least I knew what the hell was going on.



“Where are you taking me?” I asked.



“You’re buying yourself a friendship bracelet.”



“I don’t have money.”



“They don’t care about money.”



He pulled me into the very last tent, a glowing monstrosity of billowing green silk. Inside smelled like evergreens. Pine trees in the rain, just like home. As far from the arid concrete heat of Gut Street — real Gut Street and fake Gut Street alike — as it is possible to be.



That, too, put me at ease.



I stood awkwardly while Asher negotiated with the tattooist, an impossibly slender lady with the darkest eyes I’ve ever seen. 



“What’s her blood type?”



“B negative, I think,” I said.



Asher waved me off. “The ticket man said dragon.”



Her eyebrows knit together. “And he let her in?”



“I wanted to bring her, and I’m very persuasive,” said Asher.



The woman inked the delicate rune-like pattern I’d coveted for so long onto my palm. She incorporated the bite mark into the design. Looking at it made my stomach turn.



When she was done, Asher said, “Time to go home. They get weird around here with people who have brand-new friendship bracelets.”



He tried to collect Amanda on our way out. We found her in a palatial tent swirling with colored smoke and more magic birds with their deafening song. Big cats lounged on a dais beside her, and doe-eyed admirers watched her from every corner.



She ignored us.



I wanted to go into the tent — not to bother her, just to see — but Asher wouldn’t let me.



“Not in there,” he said. “Ever.”



Feeling disappointed — I mean, what’s the point of being forced to go tripping if I couldn’t even enjoy myself? — we left the midway. The ticket man waved as we hurried back down the street



Birds swarmed overhead, singing and chattering. It would have been so beautiful if it wasn’t so *loud*.



As we rushed past the houses, one of the doors opened. Not just any door — the door to the nicest, prettiest house on the street, and Jason stepped out.



I stopped, but Asher pulled me along. “Remember the rule,” he said.



We reached the culvert and crawled back home.



It took a lot less time to get home, but that made sense. Whatever Jason had dosed me with was wearing off, so of course reality wasn’t so stretchy anymore. 



I didn’t sleep at all.



When Jason came down the next morning to walk me to my last day of school, I accused him of drugging me. We argued. He said he’d never do that, sometimes he pretended because it was funny, but only Asher and Amanda would actually do it, not him. Never him. He grabbed my hand.



And he froze.



“You went,” he said. “I told you not to.”



Questions bubbled up — *where is it, what is it, when did it start, why Amanda and not me* — but all I said was, “You don’t get to tell me to do anything. Especially when you won’t even tell me the truth.”



“What truth is there to tell? It’s a mass delusion. It’s probably carbon monoxide in the pipe, or oxygen deprivation, or—”



“Don’t tell me what you want it to be, just tell me what it actually is!”



When I talk that like, people answer. Even when they don’t want to. I guess you know that, too. 



Jason fought me, briefly. For a second I thought he was going to win and storm off like he always did.



But then he deflated. “I don’t know what it is. I’ve known about it for years. I wasn’t allowed into the carnival alone, so I took Amanda and Asher there when I met them last year. The ticket man bit us all. He said Asher tasted like an atomic bomb, Amanda tasted like a black hole, and I tasted like nothing at all. Just like here. As above, so below.” His tone was profoundly bitter. “Can’t even be worth shit in my own daydreams.”



I understood, then, why Jason hadn’t wanted me to go.



“What did he say you were?”



And I knew, the way I know things sometimes, that he was hoping I’d say *Nothing*.



“A dragon. He said I’d probably burn the place down.”



His face fell, hard. For a second he looked mean. Then he shrugged. “That wouldn’t be the worst thing.”



“Okay, but what is it?”



“I don’t know. I don’t even think it’s real.”



*That’s* when he spun around and stalked away.



He refused to talk about it again. So did Asher and Amanda. They played dumb when I pressed them, drawling “What are you *talking* about” and laughing.



It made me surer than ever that they were all fucking with me, and probably drugging me too just because they could.



Because I was just an outsider. A novelty. A game. Asher wouldn’t tell me because he was an asshole and Amanda wouldn’t tell me because even though I idolized her she detested me, and Jason wouldn’t tell me because he wanted to keep pretending that he just couldn’t ever bring himself to hurt my feelings.



After a couple days of this, I decided to check out the culvert myself for a second time. To see what was really, actually there without Jason drugging me or Asher influencing my perceptions.



When I came out on the other side of the culvert, everything was there, just as I remembered it. The beautiful version of Gut Street, the phantasmagoric birds, autumn in all its green and gold and red.



And the carnival, of course.



When I rang the bell, the ticket man’s unhappy mouth curled into a hungry smile. “My little dragon.”



“Why do you keep calling me that?”



“Because you can’t be killed. I tasted it.”



I didn’t even know what to say.



“Well…that isn’t true, not yet. You have to wait for your scales to come in because you’re a baby. And once they come in, you can’t let anyone pick them off. But when they come in, nothing will be able to kill you.” He leaned in. “That’s why they’re afraid of you. All of them. Except me.” His eyes widened and his mouth fell into a perfect *O*. “Look!”



He struck, faster than a snake, and touched my sternum, dragging his finger upward in a mockery of a caress that made my skin practically crawl off my body.



“I think you’ve already grown one! Don’t let nothing pull it off. Now — ticket, please, baby dragon.”



I held my hand out, palm up. He waved me through.



Behind him, the midway shimmered like an unimaginable dream.



But my skin kept crawling, and I couldn’t stop feeling his finger on my chest. So I turned and ran, back through that perfect version of Gut Street as carnival music echoed and birdsong roared.



When I got home, I pounded on Jason’s door until he answered. I pushed past him and slammed the door. “What did you give me the other night?”



“Nothing! I told you, it was just—”



“I went to that— that carnival just now, and—”



“With who?”



“No one! Just me, but that’s not—”



“You went there *alone*? How?”



“I *went*! What is so *hard* about—”



“It’s the second rule. You can’t go to the carnival alone. They won’t even let you in. That’s why I brought Amanda and Asher.”



I thought of the ticket man and wanted to cry. “Well, the ticket man let me in.”



Jason told me I was wrong, I was remembering everything wrong, I was just wrong, wrong, wrong, until he worked himself into a frenzy.



I couldn’t take it anymore so I went home.



Since I was sweaty and stressed and streaked with mud from crawling through the culvert. I decided to shower. As I stripped down, I felt something weird. Something hard and smooth on my skin. Almost like glass.



I looked down. In the center of my chest — right where the ticket man touched me — was a tiny, hard patch of copper. 



A scale.



A bright, shiny lizard scale.



Later that night, I saw Asher and Amanda through my window, lingering in the courtyard.



I hesitated, thinking of what Jason would say.



Then I went down anyway.



“Look who it is,” Amanda said. “And just in time.”



“For what?”



“For a carnival ride or three.”



I was tempted.



That was why I’d come down here in the first place, right? And the both looked so beautiful. Asher was radiant, and Amanda was so lovely she somehow made him look dim by comparison. Her skin was literally shining. No — things *in* her skin were shining. Lights. Miniature stars, or maybe tiny galaxies, glowing faintly as they shifted along her arms.



“What’s the matter?” Asher asked.



He looked wrong too. He wasn’t just radiant. He was golden. Like gloaming itself turned into skin. Like something about to explode.



“Look,” I said weakly. “Just…look at her. Look at yourself.”



He did as I said, distinctly unimpressed. “I don’t see anything. Are you coming or not?”



I didn’t go. 



I went to Jason’s. He answered the door before I even knocked and hugged me immediately, all enmity forgotten. He apologized profusely. Endlessly. Until I acknowledged it, until I told him it was okay, until I told him he hadn’t even really done anything wrong, until I was practically in tears.



Afterward, he made tea. I watched him closely. As far as I could tell, he didn’t put anything in it. I still didn’t want to drink it.



But I did anyway.



After he fell asleep, I went to the carnival by myself for the third time.



And when I crawled out into that perfect, bright autumn day, a weight I hadn’t even realized I’d been carrying fell off my shoulders. I sighed with relief. The birds seemed to echo it in their song, which made me smile.



When I approached the gate, the ticket man’s unhappy mouth flipped upside down. “The baby dragon isn’t here to burn down my carnival, is she?”



“Never.”



He struck again, too fast to see, too fast to even feel until it was done. His hands on my shoulders, not squeezing but bearing down.



“Who are you?” he asked.



“The dragon,” I said.



He leaned in, squinting. “Are you sure? You look like a Wendy to me.”



I wrenched free and marched past the gate, but not before throwing him the dirtiest look I could muster.



Asher was waiting for me on the midway, more radiant than ever. “I knew you were coming. I knew it!” He knotted his hand through mine and pulled me down the promenade.



We found Amanda. She was, and remains, the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. Outer space incarnate. Darker and brighter than the universe itself.



I could probably talk for days about the carnival, which is weird because I can’t even recall specific memories. Just a whirlwind of things that were beautiful and things that were pretending to be beautiful, all of them terrifying and all of them exhilarating.



When I got home the next morning, I noticed new scales on my shoulder. One on the left, two on the right.



That was our pattern for weeks.



Every night, I’d meet Asher and Amanda in the courtyard to sneak down to the carnival under Gut Street.



When I got back every morning, I had new scales. Hard and smooth and bright. Bright as the light in the carnival. Pure autumn glory.



Amanda and Asher both regarded my scales with awe. “You’re so lucky,” Amanda breathed. “Atomic bombs detonate. Black holes collapse. But nothing can kill a dragon.”



I was *sure* they were drugging me, and themselves too. I know that sounds paranoid, but I figured they’d finally figured out how to dose me in a way I couldn’t detect.



And you know what? I didn’t care.



I did care about the scales, though. I hid them from everyone else, myself included. Looking at them made me feel insane. Wearing long sleeves and sweatshirts in Stanislaus County in the summer is brutal, but it kept me from having to look at myself.



The hardest part was Jason. I couldn’t hide the scales from him, so I just sort of hid from him. 

But that didn’t last forever. How could it?



I finally showed him hoping against hope that he’d think they were beautiful.



Instead, he told me how much it hurt him to see them, to know I’d gone to the carnival, and how stupid I was, and all he wanted was the best for me. How maybe I thought Nothing At All wasn’t good enough for a Dragon. And I’d be right, because he wasn’t good enough for anything. He was just nothing.



By the end, I was crying.



Once we were done, I tiptoed into his bathroom and pulled my own scales off.



I stayed away from the carnival after that.



The confusing thing was, I knew that staying away was the right thing to do. But it felt like I was doing the right thing for the wrong reason.



And that just meant I was doing the wrong thing anyway. 



Asher didn’t understand why I stopped going. He thought I was scared. He offered to protect me, to punch the lights out of the ticket man, to explode at anyone who made me feel threatened.



One afternoon, in the middle of one of these wheedling sessions, he stopped dead.



“What?” I asked.



He struck so fast I couldn’t react and tugged my shirt down past my shoulder, exposing the bare mottled skin where scales had been.



“Where are they?” 



His voice was soft, even gentle. But it made me shudder.



I yanked it back up. “They fell off. Actually, they were never there because people don’t have scales.”



“Dragons do.” He frowned. “They’ll never grow if you hide them. They need the sun.”



“I don’t want them to grow.”



“Why?”



“Because they’re not real, and even if they are I wouldn’t have them if I hadn’t gone to the carnival.”



He was quiet for a while. 



Then —



“I can barely see anymore. It started the first time I went to the carnival. I’m almost blind now. But I can do and feel everything else a thousand times better. By comparison, seeing crippled me. Without your scales, you’re crippled.” 



“You’re not making any sense. And the scales aren’t even real.” I believed this, and still do. “We’re all seeing things. I don’t know how, exactly, but I know some kind of drug is—”



“There’s no drug,” he said. “Only us.”



I felt humiliated. Scared, too. Scared that we were losing our minds. Scared that this was a bad trip that would never end. Scared that Asher would see in my face that I had pulled my own scales off. 



So I went home.



Jason came by. The first thing he did was check me for new scales. Maybe because he saw me with Asher. Who knows? Who cares? I don’t. Not anymore.



Late that night, I went back to the courtyard. I just wanted to be alone. No Jason, no Asher, no Amanda who didn’t even want to talk to me anyway. I didn’t expect anyone to be there, especially not this late.



Except Asher was. 



“Did he take your scales?” he asked.



He was practically glowing. Golden. He looked like an angel. I noticed, though, that his eyes weren’t right. Stiff, somehow. Unmoving. Unseeing.



“No.”



“What happened? Scales don’t fall off unless they rot. Are you rotting?”



“No.”



He grabbed my hands and raised them to his face and breathed deeply. “Why do I smell them on your hands? Scales never grew on your hands.”



My heart thundered. I tried to distract him, tried to make him talk, to say anything, think about anything but—



“You pulled them off.” He sounded almost awestruck. “You took your own scales away.”



He pulled me to my feet, and I let him.



I let him lead me through the courtyard, down the road, and into the culvert.



I let him lead me down the shimmering tree-lined lane with its screaming chorus of unearthly birds, all the way to the carnival under Gut Street.



Asher rang the bell. The ticket man erupted into being, all big bright eyes and an unhappy mouth that did not turn into a smile this time.



Asher said, “My dragon has no scales.”



The ticket man struck, leaping over the counter and crushing me in a bear hug so tight I couldn’t breathe. Dark spots swarmed my vision, and I felt so warm. I wondered, dimly, what would happen to my body down here in the carnival. I decided that I didn’t want to know.



Then the ticket man let go.



Air rushed back. My hands flew to my chest, checking instinctively for injury. Where there should have been skin, I felt something hard and smooth.



Panicking, I pulled my shirt over my head. I knew, somehow, that there was no need for modesty now. And sure enough, when I looked down:



Scales, bright as the sun, red as autumn, shimmering everywhere the ticket man touched. Shoulder to hip, blinding in the afternoon light. Bright as a supernova.



But all I could see was Jason’s face.



I started to peel them away.



Asher lunged. I twisted to the side, but he hit me anyway. Only…the hit didn’t hurt. He tried to grab me, but his hands slid right off. He tried again, and I slipped away.



The ticket man struck. Too fast to see. Too fast to react. And he punched me, square in the chest.



I didn’t even feel it.



But his hand folded in on itself, a mass of blood and rubbery skin and splintered bone. Like a car accordioning in a wreck.



He looked down at his hand, then back at me.



His unhappy mouth turned into a very happy one indeed, and he laughed.



I ran.



His laughter chased me down the street, past the perfect houses and the gleaming sidewalks and the trees all green and gold and red, drowning out the deafening birdsong.



I hit the culvert on my knees and crawled away.



Jason found me cowering in my room, sobbing as I pulled off the scales. They wouldn’t come off easily anymore. They left bruises and blood.



I thought he’d be gentle when he saw that I was trying, when he saw the blood-stained pile shining in the afternoon sun.



But he only got angry.



It made me cry. That worked, somehow. When I was small and scared and telling him how sorry I was, how he was right, how he’d been right all along, he stopped being angry and was himself again. Kind and sweet and gentle.



That should have been the end, but it wasn’t.



Asher came to me that night. I lived on the third story of the apartment. So when I heard tapping on my window, I thought I was dreaming.



When I looked over and saw Asher, radiant and bright as the rising sun with eyes dull and milky, I still thought I was dreaming.



Until he said my name. “Come home. You’re there. I know you’re there. I smell you.”



I got out of bed very slowly, very carefully. I crept out of my room, and down the hall, and out of my apartment, and to Jason.



Long story short — or short story shorter — Jason moved, and took me with him.



My scales kept growing. I kept pulling them. I guess that means nothing changed.



I don’t know if Jason changed or not.



All I know is he couldn’t cope. He couldn’t hold down a job. His well-managed addiction spiraled out of control. He couldn’t even handle his own feelings. He blamed himself for having them, and blamed me for making them worse, and then apologized for blaming me and making me sad. Whenever he got upset or whenever I got upset, he always apologized. Always sobbed his heart out. Always said he was so sorry for being nothing. I didn’t like how he sounded when he apologized for being nothing, though.



Maybe it was just my teenage insecurity, but whenever he apologized for being nothing, he didn’t sound sorry.



He just sounded cruel.



Watching him fade made me feel so guilty.



I told him that once, expecting him to apologize yet again.



But what he said was, “You should be. You’re the one who grew scales.”



That was the day I decided to stop pulling them.



When I stopped pulling them, Jason went off the deep end.



There was one night where I couldn’t take it anymore. He was high as a kite, shivering and shuddering after taking God knew what. I wanted to call an ambulance. 



He said, “An ambulance is too much money to waste on nothing.”



Instead of calling an ambulance. I got into bed and waited for him to fall asleep. Then I searched the house for all his shit, flushing everything I found down the toilet.



After that, I went for a walk.



I wandered for a long time. At some point, I noticed a culvert.



And inside it, something radiant.



I wasn’t even surprised when Asher crawled out.



Twice as tall as he’d ever been, beautiful in ways that nothing should be beautiful. Except for his eyes. Where his eyes had been was a bony plate, glimmering the same color as his wide, white smile.



I turned around and went back home, where I crawled into bed next to Jason.



When I woke up, he was dead.



And as I sat there, numb and angry and guiltier than I have ever been, I felt something hard and light tumble down my stomach..



Then another, and another. Then a cascade



I took off my shirt and watched all my scales slide off.



They never grew back. 



I guess that means Nothing killed the dragon after all.





\* \* \*



“So, can you believe I ever passed a psych eval, let alone three?” 



Christophe looked upset. “Do you really think that is a funny thing so say?”



Bypassing that, here’s the sequence of events that resulted in the above heart to heart with my least-favorite wolfman.



Long story short, the commander’s been coming down hard on me to explain what happened with Pierrot. I’ve told him everything I can, but he thinks I’m holding back. Worse, he thinks I might be a security risk. When staff in the Pantheon become security risks, they disappear.



So I’ve been stressing. I’m in trouble. I hate being in trouble, even as a whole-ass adult.



And I don’t think I’ve ever been in worse trouble in my life.



After my fifth post-Pierrot interrogation, I went out for a walk. The facility is deep in the woods, and I mean *deep.* I love being out there. The air is redolent of pine, which reminds me of all the good things about where I grew up while dredging up none of the bad things. It’s soothing.



So that’s what I was doing: Taking a long walk. I had my voice recorder to review yesterday’s interview and catch up on all the work I was missing thanks to the commander’s increasingly unhinged debriefs. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t focus. I finally gave up and tucked it into my pocket.



“You are not supposed to take that outside the facility”



I admit, I screamed.



“You act like you see me for the first time every time,” Christophe complained. 



“What are you doing out here?”



“Working.” He drew up beside me. The usual anxiety and adrenaline that accompanied his presence surged, but for once I was too scared of other things to particularly care. “Unlike you.”



“Then go work.”



“You are my work.”



I thought I was going to cry from frustration. “Are you taking me back for another round with the commander?”



“No. I want to talk to you.”



“About what?”



“Whatever you are holding back, stop. If you don’t talk — or if you do talk and they don’t believe you — they will send you down for evaluation.”



“Down where?”



“R&D.”



“Research and Development?”



“Yes, but we call it Research and Destruction.”



“Great. Have they evaluated you?”



“Many times. It is why I am so cooperative.” 



I hesitated. “I really don’t know what else to tell them.”



“You are lying.”



He was right.



“It has nothing to do with Pierrot or anything.”



“What does it have to do with?”



“Drugs. And a carnival.”



“I was in a carnival once. In the freak show.”



“You didn’t tell me about that.”



“I haven’t told anybody about that, and I don’t want to. Especially not you.”



For some reason, this gave me an idea. “You want to do me a favor?”



“Is there any answer I can give that will not upset you somehow?”



I pulled the voice recorder out of my pocket and held it out. “Here. It’ll be easier talking out here, even to you, than in there with the commander breathing down my neck. He trusts you, and you can tell when I’m lying anyway, right?”



“You tell on yourself. I only hear it.”



“Whatever. Just take it.”



He did. 



I started talking. 



And that’s how I told the scariest thing in the Pantheon the story of how nothing killed a dragon.



Then I made my stupid joke about psych evals, and he told me it wasn’t funny. Then he said, “You forgot all of this happened to you?”



“Definitely not. I just thought everyone was drugging me or something.”



He looked pained. “That is not what drugs do.” Then he looked down at the voice recorder. “I don’t think the commander should hear this.”



“Why?”



“I know the commander. I know he will want to try to make your scales grow back. It seems they grew when you were not feeling safe.”



“They didn’t grow. They weren’t real.”



“I think they were. He will think so too. He will make you feel unsafe to try and make them grow. He will probably use me to do it, and he will make sure I have all my teeth for it. I don’t want that any more than you.”



“What was the point of talking to you?”



“Because I know you are not lying.”



“How does that help me?”



“I will tell him we spoke and that you are confused and frightened, but hiding nothing.”



He held the recorder out.



Anyway, my impromptu interview wasn’t the most important thing that happened tonight.



The most important thing happened when we got back.



Charlie rushed out to meet us. “Where have you been?”



“Working together,” said Christophe.



Charlie looked at us with an expression I didn’t like, but also found amusing. “You’re going to have to work together some other time because you’ve got actual work to do.”



“Which is?”



“The Harlequin.”



I swear my heart stopped.



“They’re ready to take him, and we're leaving at midnight. Rafael’s already pissed.” He looked at me. “So you need to be really careful.”

He and Christophe exchanged another look I didn’t like. We got ready, and now we’re waiting to deploy or whatever the word is for what we’re about to do.



I wish I hadn't spent my last night on earth telling the big bad wolf about the carnival under Gut Street.

Nicotine is a weak base (pKa ~8.0). To cross the mucous membrane in your mouth, it needs to be in a non-ionized state. Coffee, soda, and energy drinks are acidic (pH 3-5), so if you drink them within 15 minutes of chewing, you acidify your saliva. This ionizes the nicotine, trapping it in your saliva so you swallow it instead of absorbing it. The result: you get the gut rot (nausea) but zero brain focus.

There are a few ways to fix this. First, rinse your mouth with water (neutral pH) before popping a piece. Some biohackers add a tiny pinch of baking soda to their water to alkalize the mouth before dosing. Creates a ""freebase"" environment that hits significantly harder. The other rule is no acidic drinks while the gum is in your mouth, at least for the first 20 minutes. I personally got tired of timing my coffee breaks around my gum, so I switched to bizz. It uses 6-methyl nicotine, which has a higher receptor affinity (3x that of nicotine). Because the analog is so much more potent at the receptor site, I don't need to obsess over mouth pH or ""perfect"" absorption conditions to get the effect. It punches through the ""coffee barrier"" better than standard salts.

Anyone else noticed the ""coffee cancel"" effect with standard nicorette?",3,1764784204.0,NooTopics,1,0.71,False

I’ve been in insurance long enough to smell trouble before it even rounds the corner. And yes, you do. I say that with love, not sales pressure. I’ve sat in enough shop offices with sawdust on the desk and coffee that tastes like burnt toast to know how thin margins can feel in the early days. But one slip of a ladder or a drill biting into the wrong stud can wipe out months of work.

I once worked with a handyman who swore he only took on “simple stuff.” Swapping outlets. Fixing sticky doors. Repainting rentals that always smelled faintly of mildew and lemon cleaner. Then one afternoon, he nicked a water line while installing a vanity. He heard that awful hiss, then watched the wall darken like it was soaking up bad news. The repair bill? Way more than he’d made that month. His policy turned what could’ve been a business-ending blow into a shrug and a lesson.

And here’s the thing: clients pay attention. When you show up with proof of insurance, you look steady. You sound steady. Folks trust you to handle their home without sending their stress levels through the roof.

I tell new handymen this: keep your startup lean, patch your own drywall, share tools when you can, run your books from the kitchen table — but don’t skip liability coverage. It’s one of the rare expenses that actually gives you breathing room.

When you’re building a business from scratch, you need that. Trust me. I’ve seen too many good workers learn it the harder way.",1,1764784117.0,USAbusinessinsurance,0,1.0,False
1pdb2s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1pdb2s0/sudden_intrusive_thoughts_about_old_flame_despite/,Sudden intrusive thoughts about old flame despite being happily married. Post birth control chaos!,"::Long Read::

To preface, I recently came off birth control almost 2 months ago after being on it for 10+ years, my hormones are going COMPLETELY crazy. I've only ever wanted a serious monogamous relationship,  I've never once looked at another guy throughout our entire relationship and I've only have eyes for my husband which is why this is even more frustrating to deal with. My husband and I have both been cheated on in our most serious relationships so we're both very open to each other when it comes to all this. We've got married recently and he's always been my best friend and what feels like soulmate. We're very much alike , have similar antics, and have a lot in common. He's such such a selfless guy who always puts others before himself. Not to mention our sexual chemistry is on point. We both decided it would be good to try and come off birth control in an effort to save my long lost libido in our relationship. Since coming off, things are heating up and I've been feeling less like a shell of a person. Not trying to force myself in the mood most of the time has been a significant plus. My husband and I are very open and he's openly expressed that if he was ever struggling with something similar, he'd talk to me about it. I'm considering bringing this up to him, though I'm also not trying to give it more weight than it needs, you know? I'm not afraid to talk to him, but I also don't want to give him any reason to worry since he's been cheated on and hurt badly before. Perhaps I need to give it a few more days and see if it passes... I know Reddit isn't the ideal place for advice, though since I don't go to therapy, I'm just hoping to get some outside advice on whether anyone has dealt with something similar and perhaps the best way to manage this. I'm not trying to fudge up my marriage because of some silly fantasy. In addition, it's not fair to my very amazing wonderful husband who always puts me first. I'd never want to intentionally hurt him. Though I do consider myself mature enough to be able to not overstep boundaries if needing closure, the question though is that is it even worth it?

Anyways, the other night I had a dream about an old flame that I had back in college. Nothing bad, just literally saw his face. Because I feel that the situation is awfully relevant to how I'm feeling, I'm going to go into the story. Me and this guy had some type of instant chemistry upon eye contact during a class and afterwards he followed me to my car and told me to ""wait up"" because I was walking so fast... which I always thought was super smooth and hot. We exchanged introductions, numbers and started hanging out before and after class in addition to engaging in some pretty intense stare sessions during class. We started texting and soon went out for a date at a coffee shop. We hit it off incredibly well personality wise and the ""passion"" so to speak was incredibly intense all the time. To the point we'd be texting each other everyday to get our ""fix"". We never actually did the deed, though we'd spend most of our time teasing each other non stop behind the phone. We became pretty close to the point I thought we'd start officially dating and then I found out he was moving to Washington like within a week of letting me know. We continued to text until neither of us could really handle it anymore so we got together before he left...problem was our session was cut short due to needing to help a friend out, so we basically got all worked up for nothing. That was the last time I got to see him for a while, though we continued to text each other for A YEAR AND A HALF everyday, practically non-stop teasing as per usual. Though at some point though, we noticed that we both just enjoyed each other's company and it turned into this soft need for companionship and we both found we really understood each other. Even began exchanging the ye old ""love you"" here and there even though we weren't official. This situation caused not only significant pent up energy, but really cause a lot of insecurity since I felt not good enough to pursue long distance. So I ended up getting on Tinder just to get some  physical ""relief"", but I also wanted to try and find someone who was willing to go out with me to ease this insecurity. (immature and wrong approach, I know). I did all this while I continued to push for an official relationship between us where I could visit and not have to try and manage this on the side. So me and Washington man basically ended up being in a long distance relationship without any labels and I've never quite understood why he could never fully commit. I assumed it to be because of a significant age difference (being at different points in our lives) and him not wanting to try and manage a long distance relationship since they are hard. I didn't have the means of moving to Washington nor did he have the intention of moving back as he was trying to finish college out there and become a firefighter. Really I think we were attempting to avoid the hardship even though we continued to lead each other on for so long and developed a true connection. Fast forward and we begin discussing me taking a trip out there for a week. I meet another guy who I will precede to date for about 3 years, though at the very beginning of this new relationship I already had this trip planned to go see Washington man. I decided to still go since me and the new man weren't official that I felt I really needed to take this trip to finish this chapter of the book so to speak before I literally exploded from anticipation. New guy gave green light and Washington man was aware I was talking to someone new. So I get out to Washington and it's like some damn romance movie while we're out there. We went out on a few dates, had some romantic dinners and throughout all that he was super smooth and gentlemanly the whole time. He even carried me to bed one night after I passed out watching a movie. Most importantly we finally got to release our pent up energy with each other. All my life I've always been a sucker for romance and scenes you might see out of a movie so it doesn't help remembering how great this situation ended up being and the slow burn that came from it. Despite all this he still didn't want to pursue long distance.

When I got back me and my ex started going out, though he didn't make it official for quite a while even though we were living together. Me and Washington man were still talking, but we were starting to talk less and less because Washington man had a difficult time trying to just be friends and I didn't want to cause problems in my relationship as it got more serious.  Washington man tried very hard to try and pull back his feelings and I did very well not encouraging him if he slipped up, though we did ultimately stop talking because this new relationship finally got official and Washington man had developed feelings for me and found it really hard to treat me as a friend. My ex and I's relationship turned toxic and when things started getting bad, he cheated on me multiple times and I tried reaching out to Washington man again since he wasn't a total douchebag and actually cared about me. I can't remember how that all ended, but I fear I may have ghosted Washington man which I feel super bad about not giving some kind of closure. Part of me wants to reach back out and get some type of closure via text because I figure if he attempts to try and come on to me again I can handle diverting to what I actually need to talk about. Though, I think we all know this is probably the worst option and I shouldn't feed into it.

So I've been thinking of all that in addition to creating my own fantasies in my mind about us, which I realize none of it's real. I'm having a difficult time moving past it because I know he was super smooth and romantic. And honestly imagining how he would be is pretty straight forward since I know how he would respond to basically everything. He always knew when to switch on the charm. My brain won't stop imagining it.

So apparently coming off birth control and having one dream is enough to rise previous pent up energy from the dead.

What's even more annoying and frustrating about this is my husband wants me all the time. It's not like I'm not getting what I need out of him, he gives me everything I ask for and more, yet my brain suddenly out of nowhere is hung up on this weird fantasy that was supposed to have been solved when I went out to see Washington man years ago. Perhaps hubby could use some work on the smooth/romantic factor and that may help? Even so...certainly not a deal breaker in my book for hubby if not perhaps a simple desire that most women want.",1,1764784085.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

Need advice on pacing.,"Matched with a girl on Hinge and we had a really solid back-and-forth — good vibe, easy conversation, nothing forced. After a bit of chatting, I got her number and the convo continued naturally over text.

We scheduled a first date for Saturday. When confirming details, I ended the conversation with:

“I’ll text you tomorrow.”

Now I’m wondering if that was a mistake.
I know that texting too much before the first date can kill momentum or create unnecessary pressure, and I don’t want to overdo the communication before we even meet.

At the same time, I also don’t want to look flaky by not following through on what I said.

I don’t want to text her something generic like “how was your day,” because it feels like it adds no value. I was thinking about sending something more playful and connected to our earlier conversation. For example:

“(Name), I’ve got an idea for Saturday.”
Then follow it with:

“We should order each other’s coffee.”

Context:

We already bonded over coffee, she mentioned her order was “boring,” and I teased her about it. So this would keep the vibe light and build some playful anticipation for the date without dragging things out into daily small talk.

My questions for Reddit:
	•	Is this a good approach, or should I just leave things alone until the date?

	•	Does saying ‘I’ll text you tomorrow’ actually commit me to anything, or can I give it space?

	•	Is it smart to build a little excitement before a first date, or does that risk over-texting?

I know the Knicks are on a back-to-back here, but the Hornets are in abysmal shape. Charlotte has won 6 games all season, their injury list is getting lengthy, and New York smoked them just last week by 28 points.

This initially started out as a personal project that I could look back on in years to come and relive the moment.

Soon enough, it started to grow legs and before long, I found myself writing with an audience in mind. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it and hopefully it will give a those that missed out a sense of what might be yet to come............

**RADIOHEAD**

**LONDON O2 ARENA, 22\*\*\*\*****^(nd)** **NOVEMBER 2025**

Less than three months ago, Radiohead – a band that I never stop falling in love with – dropped the bombshell that their seven-year hiatus was about to reach its end.

A new, albeit brief 20-date November/December European tour announcement was greeted with fever pitch levels of excitement and having been secretly informed earlier in the year that something was on the cards, I couldn’t allow myself to believe that it would come to fruition at such short notice.

The initial excitement levels though, were instantly tempered, not only by the anticipation of fighting it out for tickets with a wider-than-usual audience but also by a series of hoops that hopeful fans were required to jump through in order to have any chance of nabbing a ticket. A lottery system in the form of email registration was the first hurdle, which was cleared without too much fuss. An email code would then be sent to successful fans who would be invited to try their luck in the online sale proper. Having received no email code, my short-lived chances were instantly dashed and a small part of me was almost relieved that I would not have to put myself through the emotional ringer when the tickets eventually went on sale.

Already, I was composing desperate begging emails to whatever tenuous connections I had to the Radiohead camp, knowing full well that it would be a lost cause.

The day of the online sale arrived. A friend, who was one of the lucky ones, joined the virtual queue with the other tens - if not hundreds – of thousands of hopefuls. I was receiving WhatsApp updates about whatever progress he was making and having already been unceremoniously ejected from the queue, it seemed he had as good as given up.

A few minutes passed with no further news, and I braced myself for the inevitable outcome of missing out. Realising that I was jumping the gun slightly by assuming that any of the tickets would have my name on them, I even further lessened my expectations.

Another WhatsApp message from my friend pinged, accompanied by a screenshot:  
**THANKS! YOUR PURCHASE IS COMPLETE**

**SAT 22NOV 2025 18:00**

As my eyes struggled to focus and comprehend what exactly I was looking at, I am given the best news possible. A ticket is mine for the taking. I howl with delight, and if I was limber enough – and twenty-five years younger – actual cartwheels would have been at least attempted.

Following several weeks of continuously pinching myself and feeling some level of sympathy for those friends who were not so lucky, the day of the show finally arrives.

A 5am start is the order of the day, and as I wait for my lift to the airport in the predawn darkness, I am already consumed by thoughts of ""am I up to this?"" It is all I can do to hope beyond hope that by the time 8:30pm comes around, I will have been energised with some new-found burst of adrenaline to see me through it all.

After a short flight across the Irish Sea, we are greeted by a rainy London as we touch down at Stansted, and thanks to the knowledge of my travelling companions, there is no time wasted in boarding the train to Liverpool St. The few hours that follow are spent killing time before check-in at our hotel and after some much-needed grub and a coffee at the lively Spitalfields Market, I am finally feeling awake. Outside, a mince pie giveaway to mark ‘National Mince Pie Day’, (stick it in your calendars) is gladly received. Our stroll through London continues, part of which finds us in the iconic Rough Trade Records, off Brick Lane: a street name that was not unfamiliar to me, but I’m not quite sure why. Monopoly perhaps? 

Check into the hotel, where between us we either pass out, venture back outside for a spot of sightseeing, or, like me, kick back to watch some run-of-the-mill daytime television. Very slight feelings of drowsiness are swiftly batted away.

Fast forward a few hours - during which I find myself in the most chilled out of company - we make our way to the venue. Whatever nerves had made themselves known to me up until that point have swiftly vanished and morphed into unbridled anticipation. World-famous landmarks appear before me with almost every corner turned, and with each hour that passes in this enormous and vibrant city, I feel simultaneously inspired and overwhelmed by everything around me.

Destination O2 Arena, and after a quick bite, we descend into the capital’s head-scratchingly cavernous and labyrinthine underground rail network.

I casually scan the hoards of commuters for any signs of where they are headed, and notice I am in the minority of those sporting Radiohead t-shirts. Perhaps the 'new breed' – who are well represented - see the displaying of one's allegiance/devotion to a musical entity as being a little too '20th century' for their liking. 

We trundle on, and as we near closer to our destination, the previous week’s calculations of ""how many more sleeps?"" become ""how many more stops?"". 

We emerge, sardine-like, from the train station, and the hubbub that surrounds us becomes increasingly apparent. Shouts of ""anyone selling tickets?"" are interspersed with ever so slightly out of tune buskers and sights of ticketless fans holding aloft home-made signs which very graphically encapsulate their hopeless situation. The exterior dome of the O2 arena magically appears before us, impossibly stretched across the Greenwich Peninsula, with its protruding beacon-lit steel masts reaching skyward. You've made it, you’re here. 

Suddenly a fleeting sense of panic washes over me as we approach the main entrance. ""What if we've been scammed?"", I thought. ""What if these tickets aren't genuine?"". The ramifications of such an outcome are too extreme for my brain to contend with, and within the space of a few seconds, I think there and then that it’s all been a sick joke and that the jig is officially up.

'BEEP' goes the scanner, as my friend holds out his phone, followed by '""go ahead""................and breathe.

Once inside, the sheer scale of the building truly hits home, and walking through the seemingly endless interior feels like a journey into the unknown, in more ways than one. Passing by the multitude of busy shops, restaurants and bars (is this a concert venue or shopping complex?), I am struck by just how calm and relaxed I feel. This is not only a world away from my state of mind earlier that morning, but also from Radiohead gigs past where I would have done whatever was necessary to secure a prime location in front of the stage. Welcome to your 50's, I think to myself.

With coats deposited, we finally enter the arena where we are immediately confronted by the stage's impressive - if not intimidating in appearance - enclosure. First impressions are of just how close the stage feels, regardless of our vantage point. The less than conventional ‘in the round’ set-up is new territory for the band and fans alike and gives the occasion a somewhat ceremonial feel.

We circle the stage for a few minutes and settle on a spot facing what I refer to as 'Jonny's switchboard', an instrument of sorts, comprised of a multitude of wires, knobs and controls. It would not look out of place in a 1950’s-era science laboratory but is one of many contraptions that contributes so crucially to the overall Radiohead sound.

In just over sixty minutes, I would witness Radiohead take to the stage for the twenty first time, a little over 30 years to the day since I first saw them perform at the Brixton Academy, a few miles down the road. 

I don’t see Radiohead's sound engineer at his usual spot at the sound desk and as I scan the faces of the crew behind the barrier, not one of them are familiar to me. A brief name-check returns a confused expression from a crew member. Ok, no setlist tonight, deciding there and then to let it go. Position resumed.

30 minutes. 20 minutes. 8 minutes. 2 minutes. 45 seconds......... the security staff part the crowd just to our right, as a pathway to the stage is made for the band. Lights down. Noise.

The sweetest of Kid A-inspired drones momentarily fills the arena, and there they are. My heart is pounding, and I find myself giddily balancing on the balls of my feet, as I crane my neck to get a look at them passing within mere feet of where I am. It's all getting a bit too much.

With the enclosure still fixed firmly in position, the intro to 2+2=5 kick-starts proceedings. I exchange glances with my friend as we give each other a knowing grin. I can't believe I am actually here. Giant projections fill the entire enclosure with in-your-face close-ups.

‘Airbag’ follows, which sees the band exposed for the first time as the individual screens are slowly hoisted upwards by degrees. Jonny, flitting between keyboard and Telecaster, is impressively bent double over his axe, making it do things that eventually make me laugh out loud, as I take in my surroundings and think ""bloody hell"". 

The momentum continues with 'Jigsaw' and the whole place is positively alive. 'All I Need' brings things down a notch and for the first time, a baggy-trousered Thom crosses to the other side of the stage, hidden from where we stand, but Jonny and his xylophone are in full view. My 16 year-old daughter informed me earlier this year that this was her favourite Radiohead song, so it was only right that I recorded some video footage to soften the blow of her not being here. Spoiler alert: it didn't.

The menacing and foreboding tones of 'Ful Stop' give Thom an opportunity to get his groove on, which I can just about make out from where we stand.

An honourable mention, even at this early part of the show, has to go to Radiohead’s newest touring member, percussionist Chris Vatalaro, who is very much in the zone and assuredly putting his own stamp on things. An inspired choice.

Preceded by a beautiful piano intro, 'Nude' comes next as Thom falsettos his way through in the way only he can. That said, I cannot help but notice that certain parts of the song (and one or two others throughout the evening) are not delivered with the same intensity as they have become associated with. Perhaps the vocal cords are being rested tonight or maybe the high notes are coming to him less easily. Either way, the song does not suffer.

We are treated to yet another In Rainbows offering in the shape of ‘Reckoner’, followed by ‘The Bends’, a song that my 22-year-old self ‘air-guitared’ to death in the confines of my 90's bedroom. Thirty years on, I am still at it. Just in a much bigger room.

‘Separator’ - the first of two King of Limbs era songs in the set - gives us another opportunity for a breather before a 'restarted' Pyramid Song leaves us all warm and fuzzy, and the temptation to drum along to Phil's fractured beats is too great to resist. 

Still with only a partial view of Thom on stage, the opening electro beats of ‘Sit Down Stand Up’ arrive and as ever, I eagerly await the change of gear about halfway through from the introduction of the electronic beat - one of my favourite Radiohead moments. Thom, meanwhile, wigs-out to the extreme during the 'the raindrops' section before the song grinds to its usual abrupt halt.

So far, I am in dreamland, and it feels slightly odd watching them perform not in support of an album release. The mood on stage too, feels different. Less tense, more, I don't know.....free. More celebratory. Euphoric, even. Whatever you want to call it, they're all clearly enjoying the moment and I find it impossible to imagine how anyone else witnessing this could not feel the same way. ‘Myxomatosis’ has me transfixed as I spit the words out line by line, while finding myself almost mimicking Thom's 'twitching' actions as he roamed the length and breadth of the stage. If only my kids could see me now.

I had already given up on catching any glimpse of drummer Phil, with him being barricaded in by all manner of instruments, but by now I was beginning to wonder if I would get even the briefest sightings of Ed either, apart from the top of his head. Clearly not thinking straight, I ponder switching sides to enjoy some 'Ed time' before eventually thinking better of it. ‘No Surprises’ came next which was as gorgeous as ever.

The groovy ‘Optimistic’ get my hips moving again, but it's my feet that are starting to feel signs of tiredness. Hardly surprising, having been on the move for the last 16 hours straight.

No choice but to fight through it, and as if to serve as a warning to my slowly fading limbs, ‘Bodysnatchers’ jolts me into life, and I am once again back in the room.

An impeccably observed silence accompanies ‘Exit Music’ and the final song of this part of the set – a beautiful version of Street Spirit - almost makes me blub but I hold it back. Still plenty of time for waterworks.

With that, the stage is once again shrouded and a much-needed shake-out of the legs provides some temporary relief to my creaking joints.

Despite having largely steered clear of news or talk of any set lists from the previous nine shows, it is hard to ignore the feeling that something big is about to happen, comparatively speaking of course. After not too long of a wait - the boys return to the stage and deliver quite possibly the most jaw-droppingly perfect rendition of Let Down I have seen them play. I am utterly floored. The song - having been given a recent new lease of life – is greeted by a huge cheer from the masses, which feels strangely weird to me. For the longest time, this has been *my* song, and to find myself in a 20,000-capacity arena, singing it back to the band en masse, I feel like a proud parent. “Go! Go free!”.

It is Jonny who I cannot take my eyes of during these few minutes. He aimlessly circles the stage as if being controlled by the song itself while he gently jolts the neck of his guitar. His movements are more akin to that of a marionette and I am transfixed.

Not for the first time this evening, Chris Vatalaro’s efforts do not go unnoticed.

One of Thom’s few utterances of the night (“thank you, goodnight”?) precedes ‘Weird Fishes’ and once again, Jonny - appearing to exist in an alternate universe to everyone else – is the focus of my attention. Giddy big brother Colin encourages a universal, but slightly out of time hands-in-the-air clap-a-thon during the ‘I get eaten by the worms’ refrain. I watch Thom like a hawk, wondering if he is irked by this momentary distraction as he turns his head in Colin’s direction. Whether rehearsed or by intuition alone, the band’s stand-in percussionist counts them back in and all is well with the world again.

‘Idioteque’ (or ‘Idioteque Lite’, if you will) – in my own experience, the Radiohead song most likely to go wrong – goes off without a hitch, and gives Thom an opportunity to be slightly more improvisational with the lyrics than usual. It’s allowed.

‘Present Tense’ comes and goes like a dream and gives me yet another opportunity to witness up-close Jonny’s ethereal interludes that plants this song firmly within my Radiohead top five.

‘Daily Mail’ is arguably the night’s least well-known inclusion in the set, but the delicate piano-led intro followed by the rousing outro guarantees a huge cheer at the end, and as we draw closer to the night’s end, I feel emotionally spent. If not ever so slightly physically.

‘Paranoid Android’ provides me with my first proper sighting of Ed as he makes his way around to our side of the stage. But what more can be said about this song? Like Let Down before it, I am transported back to the days when this song was a work in progress, when I wondered how a band with only two studio albums to their name could have the nerve to unleash something so ambitious and incredibly not of its time.

Lord knows how many performances later (several hundred I am guessing), and each one that I have personally witnessed has been unique. Tonight is no exception.

Jonny once again takes up a familiar position in our line of vision, which I relish. Every musician on stage is switched on and contributing to this incredible piece of music in their own individual way. A certain phrase by Aristotle springs to mind but I can’t quite make it fit.

And here we are, the last hurrah. The psychedelic ‘dah-dah-dah-daaaah’ of ‘Everything in Its Right Place’ produces one of the night’s loudest roars. Thom performs at the piano directly in front of us as the other band members assume their respective positions for the twiddle-fest that ensues. It is the perfect way to bring this two and a bit hour rollercoaster of emotions to a close. This band. I can’t even.  
A round of end-of-performance bows and joined palms of genuine appreciation are sent in our direction, and the band leave the stage for the last time before making their way once again, through the parting in the crowd. I try my best to position myself so that I can get a better look at the chaps before they leave the arena and just miss out on a high five from Ed.

Security are hell bent in getting every last person out of the arena in record time as we are all ushered in the direction of the exit. I quickly scan the activity by the perimeter of the stage and the sound desk barrier, and it appears reasonably quiet. In a last throw of the dice, I hurriedly weave my way against oncoming traffic down to the sound desk at the back of the venue, which feels like an achievement in itself.

There are a handful of others pleading with various members of the sound crew, but who are eventually shooed away by some over-zealous security staff. I lean on the barrier, trying desperately to catch the eye of one of the crew, who is sitting down with a folded copy of the set list resting tantalisingly in front of him. I compose myself.  
“Excuse me, is there any chance I could get a copy of the set list?” A shake of the head is all that comes back, before he picks it up and shoves it in his back pocket.

“You haven’t come this far to get this far” I thought, so I move further down the barrier towards where more audio/visual crew were positioned. Almost out of nowhere, a guy looking ‘crewy’ enough emerges and I walk over to him as calmly as I can.

“I’m very sorry, you don’t happen to have a copy of the set list?”

 With a wry smile, he replies “maybe”. Completely thrown by this, it takes me several seconds for me to realise what he’d just said.  
   
“Oh……could I possibly have it?” (I wisely opt against bookending the question with the word ‘perchance’ for fear of overkill)  
   
“Maybe”  
 

Before I could utter another syllable, he reaches into his back pocket and produces a perfectly folded copy of the set list, as if it were a party trick. I hesitantly take it from him in amazement, my hand shaking. I’ve done it. By Jove, I’ve done it!

I shake his hand firmly and say with purpose “you will never know just what it means for me to have this.”, though I can see by his expression that he gets it. I walk away in complete and utter shock, with the biggest smile on my face. Security, do your worst!

The last time I saw Radiohead in 2017, I came away feeling like it was the end of something for the band, and I guess I was right to an extent.

This time, although it feels different, there’s something about tonight that feels somewhat temporary, with no real clues as to what 2026 and beyond might or might not bring.

A fellow-obsessive, who met briefly with Phil after the show on night three was eventually waved off with a hopeful “see you again soon”.

Watch this space.

I notice that one employee submitted the exact same Uber receipt twice (same ride and same amount 38 bucks) once in February and again in April. at first I figured it was just a mistake like maybe they just accidentally uploaded the same photo twice or something

I then started actually looking at their other submissions and that's when I was able to figure it out. Personal grocery runs labeled as 'office supplies' dinner with their friends labeled as 'client meeting' and I'm pretty sure some of the receipt screenshots were edited because the fonts looked off and dates didn't line up with the transaction amounts

I went back through about 6 months of their reports and conservatively they probably stole around $2500 (2544 bucks to be exact) from us. When I confronted them they got immediately defensive and tried to say it was ""unclear what counted as a business expense"" and then quit on the spot. Yes they quit on the spot

1pdaw1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub/comments/1pdaw1n/professional_cuddler_here_im_giving_5_free/,Professional cuddler here. I’m giving 5 free sessions to anyone who needs them.,"Hey everyone,

With the holidays coming up, I know this season can be really tough for a lot of people.

Loneliness, depression, stress, and anxiety tend to spike around this time, and sometimes what we really need is simple human connection.

I’m a professional cuddler with two years of experience, and I’d like to offer five free cuddle sessions to people who feel they could genuinely benefit from supportive, platonic touch during this time of year.

My practice has many paying clients which allows me to offer my services pro bono to others.

•	⁠What is professional cuddling? -

Professional cuddling is a structured, platonic service focused on emotional comfort, grounding, and stress relief through consensual, respectful physical touch.

Think of it as a form of touch therapy. Similar in norm-breaking to how therapy and personal training once felt “weird” before we normalized them.

Healthy human connection shouldn’t be stigmatized, and touch is something many people are starved for without even realizing it.

•	⁠If you’re struggling… -

If you’ve been dealing with loneliness, anxiety, stress, depression, or just feel disconnected, feel free to DM me. Let me know a bit about your situation and why you think cuddle therapy might help you right now. I’ll choose five people for free sessions - no strings attached.

•	⁠About me -

•	I’ve been a professional cuddler for two years •	I have references available •	I prioritize safety, consent, and comfort •	This is 100% platonic

•	⁠Logistics & Safety -

For safety reasons, I always meet new clients in a public place first, usually a coffee shop. I typically cuddle with people either at my office in Melrose or, if needed, I can drive to you (as long as you’re within about 1 hour of the Boston area).

•	⁠Important Boundary -

This is not a solicitation for dating, hookups, or a relationship of any kind.

I’m happily married, and I’m offering only platonic cuddle therapy. Please respect my boundaries. 

Update: since this came up in the comments. 35 male here. I don’t discriminate on the basis of age, race, genders, orientation or body type. This is a profession just like others. 

•	⁠General info -

We should normalize cuddling and healthy, consensual touch the same way we’ve normalized going to therapy, hiring a personal trainer, or seeking other forms of emotional/physical support. Touch is human, and many people need it far more than they’re able to admit.

As I often tell my clients, asking for help is not a sign of weakness, it is a sign of strength.

If you think this could help you, my DMs are open. 💛",0,1764783676.0,BostonSocialClub,18,0.39,False
1pdavqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/1pdavqk/power_rv_camping_info_from_an_old_guy_with_a/,Power RV Camping info from an old guy with a camper.,"I’ve gathered some stuff from previous posts to compile a helpful list of stuff for RV camping at the farm. Feel free to drop questions or share other helpful tips and tricks.



Required disclaimer: I’m 50 and my wife and I bring our 4 teenage kids to Bonnaroo. This is our big annual family vacation, so I do everything I can to make it fun and super comfortable. I completely understand that all of this seems extravagant and silly to most folks who car camp at the farm and I am certainly not trying to tell anyone how they should enjoy the experience. This is simply what works for us. Happy Roo!



**Parking:**

Please take your time and find your inner peace. Parking an RV often isn’t any fun.

If you need help backing that big bastard into your tiny little spot, ask for it. There are people around who will be happy to help you.

Park within your assigned space. Seriously, those areas are small enough without having someone else’s stuff taking up space. 

If your unit has slideouts, leave enough room when you park so that the slide(s) don’t extend into your neighbor’s space.

Meet your neighbors.

  


**Power:**



RV sites have  standard 30 and 50 amp receptacles. [Youtube Video of power connection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3zCWjan6tc)



Pro tip: get an extension for whatever power cord your RV needs in case the power box is more than 25 feet from your shore power connection. We needed one in '23 and I was glad I had it.



My RV requires a 30 amp connection, but I use a 50 amp splitter, plug the camper into one leg and run an adapter to a standard extension cord to power all of our outdoor appliances(coffee pot, air fryer, fans, party lights, etc). This minimizes the current draw on the RV’s electrical system and helps keep the power available for the AC unit, which is the single most important thing.



Here's my list of power gear that lives in my camper:

[50 Amp to 2x30 Amp Adapter Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075VKM9NQ?th=1)

[30 Amp Surge Protector](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0791RW8M2)

[30 Amp RV Power Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B093X5DHMV?th=1)

[RV 30 Amp Extension Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004809YBE?th=1)

[30 Amp to 15 Amp Adapter (10-30P to 5-15R)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00192QB3I)

[12/3 25 foot extension cord](https://www.amazon.com/AgriPro-67729001-Heavy-Duty-Workshop-Extension/dp/B07Q54VWJ1?th=1)

[Furman Power Strip](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002D017M) \- this is what I plug all my stuff outside into. It's durable and the receptacles in it are more solid than most cheap power strips.

  


**Tanks:**

It costs $60 cash(maybe more this year?) to get your tanks pumped and by day three, it can be a challenge to flag a truck down. Same cost, IIRC, to refill your freshwater tank. Overestimate how many times you will need to have your tanks pumped and bring that cash in $10 notes so you can pay the dump fee and tip the person who is literally dealing with your shit. 



Black Tank - When you flush the toilet, it goes to the black tank. Understand how much capacity the tank in your unit has, most are around 30 gallons, but there are variables that impact how quickly the thing fills up.

Here are my rules for the toilet on the camper that have served us well at places that do not have full hook-ups, like Bonnaroo. 

1. Start the trip with 5 gallons of clean water in the black tank. Dry black tanks are bad and a bit of water in there helps any solids spread out, so you don’t end up with a pyramid of stuff in there.
2. No poops in the camper, unless it’s a surprise. This isn’t a mandate, but the tank fills much slower if it’s used for #1 action only.
3. No TP in the toilet for #1 wipes. There’s a separate trash can in the bathroom for this that is emptied daily. If there are people in your group who use way too much toilet paper, it can be problematic. I once had to glove up and go shoulder deep in my camper’s shitter because someone in my group thinks they need to use a softball sized wad of TP to wipe.
4. The folks in the group who can use urinals should not use the RV toilet.

When getting the black tank pumped, hold down the flush lever when the black tank is being pumped to break the vacuum, add more water to the mix and ensure that everything leaves the tank.

  


Gray Tank - The kitchen sink, bathroom sink and shower drain into the gray tank. Just like the black tank, understand the capacity and configuration of your RV’s gray water system. Some have a single 30 gallon tank, larger units can have dual tanks or much larger single tanks. The thing that will fill your gray tank most quickly is the shower. 

1. Use an aerator shower head, this will give you good pressure, while minimizing water use. My preference is the [Oxygenics BodySpa RV Handheld Shower Head](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T91J54S?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_4).
2. Military Showers. If you’ve got a large group and small tank, this isn’t optional.
   1. Organize the stuff you need for the shower.
   2. Turn on the water long enough to get your entire body wet.
   3. Turn off the water.
   4. Wash everything.
   5. Turn the water back on long enough to rinse.
3. Dish washing
   1. Scrape all dishes and utensils into the trash prior to washing in the kitchen sink. 
   2. Do not run the sink water while washing dishes.
   3. Fill a bowl with soapy water. Use a minimal amount of Dawn, as it works the best and rinses quickly.
   4. Scrub all of your dishes with the soapy water and a Scotch-Brite Scrub Sponge.
   5. Run the water only long enough to rinse everything clean.
4. Bathroom sink activities. As with everything else, only run the water as long as you need to, that is, do not leave the water on while brushing your teeth.



I have a portable [36 gallon dump tank](https://www.amazon.com/Camco-Rhino-36-Gallon-Camper-Built/dp/B07K8NK525) that I use for gray water only. I park that next to my tank connection and use that to get an extra day out of my shower gray tank and tip the Vac-Truck operator a little extra to drain that tank as well.



Freshwater Tank - There’s a pump on the RV that draws from the freshwater tank and pushes water to all of the water fixtures. Unless you own the camper and properly service your freshwater tank, do not drink the water coming out of that tank. Bring no less than two gallons of drinking water per person for the trip. I have 6 people in my RV and we typically bring 15 1 gallon jugs of drinking water. My freshwater tank is clean and safe to drink out of, but the treatment for that makes it taste a little off, so we just don’t drink out of it. 



If I rented an RV, I’d probably figure out a way to flush the tank with a bleach solution before using it, just to be extra cautious. Empty the tank, then fill it with fresh water, adding a ½ cup of bleach for every 15 gallons. Run the pump and flow water through all of the fixtures. Let it sit for a minimum of four hours, then empty the tank and flush with fresh water prior to refilling for the trip, making sure to also flush the bleach water out of the lines going to the fixtures as well. 

  
  


Hot water - I usually run my water heater on propane, again to keep current draw down so the AC gets what it needs. Not an absolute need, but I know my camper will pull the full 30+ amps if I’m running the AC, Refrigerator and Water Heater on the electric service and given the potentially less than ideal electrical distribution system at the farm, this could cause some problems if voltage dips. 

  


**RV Luxuries:**



This is part of why we’re in RVs in the first place.

I own my camper, which is a 30 foot toy hauler, so here’s a list of fun stuff that I always have on board in no particular order:

1. [Icemaker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09133YZL4) This thing is an absolute game changer. I empty the icemaker into a 2 gallon ziploc bag that I keep in the Freezer. When that fills up, I dump it in the cooler. We never have to buy ice or have a shortage of ice for cold drinks.
2. Toaster, Instapot, Air Fryer and electric kettle, hence the need for an outdoor powerstrip on a separate feed from the camper.
3. 3 Vornado Fans, we keep one running in the camper at all times to circulate air around so the thing stays at a comfortable temperature throughout since the bedroom in mine tends to get more AC than the rest of the unit. The other two move around, but they are outside when we’re all awake and then moved inside to provide white noise and airflow for better sleep.
4. Portable Blackstone, thanks to the Canadian friends we made at ‘roo ‘25.
5. Weber Q2000 portable grill. Both this grill and the blackstone, can run on the installed propane system on the camper, but I also keep a 20lb propane tank on hand just in case.
6. Comfortable camp chairs, I have an assortment of chairs, but my current favorites are the [Kijaro Dual Lock Chairs. ](https://www.amazon.com/Kijaro-Portable-Camping-Sports-Chair/dp/B004C0QDLO?th=1) Add in some memory foam cushions for an extra dash of luxury. 
7. Tapestries to attach to the camper awning using [tarp clips](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NGCGLQL?th=1), tent stakes and shock cord.
8. [Awning Tie Down Anchor Kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDDDX3XT) good to prevent the awning from breaking when the winds pick up.
9. Thermacell, bug haven’t been a problem for us at Bonnaroo, but I always have the [Thermacell Backpacker](https://www.amazon.com/Thermacell-MR-BPR-Backpacker-Mosquito-Repellent/dp/B077ZMVMGD/) on the camper because it runs on the 100g or 230g  backpacking butane canisters which last much longer than the little butane cartridges in the standard Thermacells.
10. A healthy stock of [Nagene 32oz bottles](https://www.amazon.com/Nalgene-Sustain-BPA-Free-Material-Derived/dp/B0BMS3CLLR?th=1). There’s no glass allowed on the farm, these are great for storing liquids that come from the store in glass bottles.
11. [Coffee maker with a stainless carafe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2JK9Y8V?th=1) Again, no glass allowed on property and if the person at the gate wants to be a real stickler for the rules, they can and will take your glass coffee pot.
12.  Generator, my camper has one on board, so I just fill up the fuel tank on the way. The power at Bonnaroo has always been reliable for us, but shit happens. If you already have a generator, it’s not a terrible idea to bring it. I have a [Harbor Freight Predator 3500](https://www.harborfreight.com/3500-watt-super-quiet-inverter-generator-with-co-secure-technology-epa-71358.html) in my hurricane stash that I’d bring if I didn’t already have one on the camper.
13. Some kind of rug or mat for the area under the awning. I’m sure the new grass out there will be amazing, but having a mat outside is a nice barrier if the grass is tall.
14. [Flag Pole with LED Locator Beacon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LB7828L) Super handy for finding your camper if you happen to be parked in the middle of a row.
15. Jumper cables and a portable jump box. Nothing sucks more than attempting to start your car after a long weekend only to find out that your battery is dead. You may not need it, but it’s a nice to have to help others who might. 
16. I have a portable bluetooth speaker, but I’ve rarely used it at bonnaroo because there’s almost always someone nearby who has pretty good taste in music and a bigger speaker.
17. Cards, games and stuff to do when the weather turns to shit. Cell service is trash out there, so make sure you have some entertainment available for your group if Centerroo is evacuated again.
18. Radio Bonnaroo is back, so if your camper doesn’t have a built-in radio, it might be nice to bring one.

1pdat6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1pdat6i/a_dream_i_desire/,A dream I desire,"The silence of the morning is the loudest sound I know. It's a hollow echo that rings in the pit of my stomach, a persistent emptiness that no amount of coffee or distraction seems to fill. I wake up, and the first thought isn't of the day ahead, but of the lack within it—the sheer absence of a purpose that makes getting out of bed a necessity, not just an obligation.
I find myself wishing for a connection so profound it changes the geography of my life. To say, ""I wish I belonged to you,"" is to express a desperate yearning to be seen, to be chosen, to finally feel like a vital piece of someone else's world. What would that truly feel like? To be wanted, to be desired by the one I desire? It feels like a fantasy spun from the thread of hopeless romanticism, a wishful prayer whispered into a void.
I crave the simple, profound acts of intimacy: to be held, truly held, in an embrace that says, ""You are safe here."" To be romanced, not with grand gestures, but with the consistent, gentle attention that affirms my worth. I have so much love to give—a fierce, undivided attention that is a desire, a need, a foundational part of who I am—and it has nowhere to go. It just pools inside me, heavy and unused.
This loneliness is a physical thing. It’s the reason my mind constantly seeks an exit, a detour from the pain. It’s what drives me to that dangerous numbness, the one provided by the drug. It’s a cruel, effective shield. The drug blocks the ache, temporarily silencing the part of me that screams, ""You are alone."" It makes other things—anything, everything—more important than my own well-being, helping me ignore the gaping hole where meaningful connection should be.
I don't just lack a lover; I lack an anchor. My children have their own beautiful, full lives now, and while I’m happy for them, I miss the days of being central to their existence. Even my friends are distant or nonexistent in this landscape of solitude. Nobody is seeking my attention, and it is a pain that settles deep in my bones. It’s more than hurt; it’s a profound sense of being overlooked, of being completely adrift.
I need a reason for arising daily. I need to be someone’s sun, or even just their reliable moon. Until I find that, I will keep navigating this fog, hoping that one day, the longing will transform into belonging.

The flavor is awful, it is like a perfume or chemical with no bergamot flavor. I contacted Tazo to voice my concern about the new tea and they stated there has not been any formula changes.

1pdaoy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1pdaoy0/problems_with_the_oracle_jet/,Problems with the Oracle Jet,"Recently I've been trying to troubleshoot two issues with my Oracle Jet.

First, the volume of water from the hot water jet is way, way under where it should be. If I pour 7 ounces, I average around 5.5. If I pour 5, I get closer to 4.xx. All the way down the line, every volume is off. My first thought was scale building, but I've been descaling as recommended and this hasn't changed. The volume is consistently short.

Second, my coffee is coming out sour. I have the portafilter set to measure by volume (not time), and even if I land at exactly 30 seconds, the espresso itself is somewhere between ""noticeable sour notes"" and ""undrinkable"". Temp was at 203; I just raised it to 204 and that helped a tiny bit. This is consistent no matter what beans from what roaster I use (FWIW, I stick to dark roasts). We normally make lattes so this gets dampened by the milk, but I'd still like to tackle this.

My water is municipal tap water. It goes through an ANSI 53 filter before going in the tank, where it goes through the Breville ANSI 42 filter. It's rarely more than 3-4 days old and the tank gets scrubbed once a month with regular dish soap. I tried using remineralized distilled water (CoffeeWater brand), but that didn't make a difference ... and my water tank got slimy. Gross.

I have to say, the reputation for it being super noisy is **really** overblown, it's much quieter than my blender, and pretty much on par with my burr coffee grinder. My wife and I, hearing the reviews were trying to figure out how we could run it at night after the baby goes to bed, but when I ran it while she was in the nursery, she said she couldn't even hear it.

The recipe we tried first was

> 2 scoops whey (Ghost, Cinnamon Bun)

> 2 cups Fairlife fat free

> 1/8 tsp Xantham Gum

> 21g sugar free pudding mix

> pinch salt

> 4tsp splenda sugar blend

> 1 snickdoodle as a mixin

And it was **fantastic**, had a gelato-ish texture, tons of flavor, and shockingly rich considering that it has practically no fat (<1g).

Next batch is very similar, except that I'm trying reduced fat instead of whole fat, real sugar (the splenda blend only saved like 50 calories for the whole pint), bumping the gum to 1/4tsp and trying different mixins. Also just ordered some Soy Lecithin to play around with emulsifiers.

We'll see if the extra fats translate to a significantly better ice cream.

27F. 5’5’’. Nonactive lifestyle.

In my early 20s, I was around 130-135lbs. Over the pandemic, I was 160-165lbs.

SW: 160lb. GW: 130lb.

- June 2025: 160lbs
- July 2025: 155lbs

- Sep 2025: 147lbs
- Oct 2025: 145lbs
- Nov 2025: 142lbs
- Dec 2025: 140lbs

Starting off on Contrave was not easy for the first few days. I made the mistake of having my daily coffee with my medication on Day 1, and I was out of commission all day. (I recommend NO caffeine and eating clean to help with the nausea for the first week). However, quickly after I felt perfectly fine! 

I do still avoid caffeine where I can, but I can treat myself to a nonfat latte or a Coke Zero here or there. 

Contrave just helps with eating less, and minimizing food noise. I was never a snacker, and I eat really clean, so I didn’t really think it would work. Consider my surprise that just on Contrave alone, I’ve lost 20lbs in 6 months. I know for some, that might seem slow, but it has made a huge difference in my life with no side effects. It gradually shed my weight that steps, diets, and fastings never could. 

I’m curious to see if I can hit my GW in the next few months. Honestly, I’m thinking I might have to start adding time to the gym to get there, but I’ll report back on my process. Hope this helps someone with the same starting build as me!",3,1764783164.0,Contrave,0,1.0,False

1pdampn,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/1pdampn/coworking_in_boulder/,Coworking in Boulder?,"I moved out to Boulder and worked from Galvanize when it was on the top floor of the West End Plaza on Pearl. The space had a huge open floor plan, an outdoor deck with mountain views, and a kitchen where two beer kegs seemed to spark spontaneous conversations in the middle of the day. Weekly events kept the place buzzing, and the energy was contagious. I met people there who remain close friends even now.

Coming back though, the atmosphere feels drained. Coworking spaces don’t seem to hum with the same vitality, and working from home or coffee shops leaves me isolated. It makes me nostalgic for the kind of structured environments I’ve read about elsewhere, where even staged offices set rules like fixed working hours, bans on office romances, and codes of conduct to make the experience feel more real. Some people even used those places as a safe haven from the pressure of job hunting, or as a backdrop for social media proof that they “had found a job.”

What I’m wondering now is whether Boulder has any coworking spaces that capture that same sense of energy and belonging. Not just desks and Wi-Fi, but the little touches that make you feel part of something.  The rhythms, the gatherings, the sense that you’ll see familiar faces tomorrow. Are there spaces here that still offer that kind of community, with someone actively organizing things to keep the place alive?

I’m 20 and traveling with my boyfriend before beginning a study-abroad program in Rome. We’re doing a short trip through Central Europe and I’ve already checked the wiki pages for each city, but I’d love advice from people who’ve recently traveled these exact routes.

Here’s our current plan and the options we’re considering:

📍 **Prague — Dec 27–30**  
We land on the 27th and are choosing between:

* *Hostel One Old Town*
* *Czech Inn* Budget: ideally under €30–35 per person per night. Looking for: social but clean, lockers, decent kitchen, good tram/bus connections. Also unsure whether bus (RegioJet) or train is better/cheaper for the next leg.

📍 **Brno — Dec 30–Jan 2**  
We already booked *Hostel Eleven*, but we’re open to food/coffee bar recommendations, especially local and inexpensive spots.

📍 **Vienna — Jan 2–4**  
Looking at:

* *Wombat’s Naschmarkt*
* *a&o Wien Hauptbahnhof* Budget: under €30–40 pp/night. If anyone has experience with these around New Year, I’d love your thoughts. Also comparing RegioJet vs ÖBB for transport.

📍 **Budapest — Jan 4–7**  
We have an Airbnb already. Mainly interested in recommendations for cheap restaurants, baths, or museums that aren’t too tourist-pricey.

✈️ **Rome — Jan 7**  
Flying out that evening.

**Bonus question:**  
We’re considering adding a short trip to Morocco (Jan 15–19/20) from Rome. I’ve been reading safety threads already, but if anyone has favorite cities or budget stays they’ve personally enjoyed, I’d love to hear them.

Ill be in italy through march in Rome so any advice on things to see/do/stay would be great!! Or trips I shouldn't miss that are safe for solo/women group trips that are budget friendly ofc.

I’ve checked the relevant country guides and RegioJet/Flix/ÖBB pricing, but would appreciate input on:  
• which of the accommodation options above are reliable  
• if bus or train is better for these exact routes during winter  
• any can’t-miss but inexpensive food spots

After months of being single I decided to take matter into my own hands and ask out this guy I kept running into at a local coffee shop. We'd chatted before and I felt a spark, so next time I saw him I decided to just give him my number. He seemed excited about it and immediately texted me to plan a date. Life got in the way a bit, so we ended up moving the date to a few weeks later. I had to initiate this, no problem. It was a good date, no awkward silences, nice conversation, lots of things in common, etc. He hugged me afterwards, said he had a good time and to text me when I got home, and that we should do it again soon. He texted me a few times during the week saying sweet things, asking bout my weekend, the usual.

After a while the texting slowed down. We both had a busy month so I was fine with it, I don't care for texting too much anyway. I'd rather go on actual dates... obviously. Last he'd said was he'd plan something, but after nearly two weeks of silence, I decided to text him asking when I'd see him again. He responded all excited again, saying he'd plan something soon and I would hear from him. Another week went by... So I text him again, saying it's been a while since we'd seen each other and asking if he still wanted to plan another date and if not, all good, I just wanted to know what to expect. He responded, apologised for communicating badly, saying he has had a lot on his mind and was busy but that he would love another date. He asked me if I had time that week. So I said I am free on Friday, and if that would work for him. This was 2 weeks ago and he never responded.

I am so sick of this lazy ass vague behaviour literally every guy I have EVER dated shows sooner or later. Why do they act like they are interested, say they like you, give you compliments and say the want to take you out when in reality they have zero interest and just end up ghosting you? I honestly 100% just do not understand!

I know I put in way too much effort and initiated too much, and I should've taken the first silence as a hint. But when he did text, he seemed so genuine and excited and interested in me. I thought this guy must really just be busy... how stupid I am. But I just really don't get it why people ghost in the first place, it is so mean and rude. He kept saying he was excited and wanted to see me again. Why lie???

I am literally at a loss, I just want to give up. Is it too much to ask for one person to just show genuine interest and put in some effort?",1,1764782793.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False
1pdag8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1pdag8l/cant_ai_just_no/,"Can't AI just...?"" – No!","The great disillusionment

A customer recently asked me, ‘Can't AI just optimise my taxes... in such a way that the tax office doesn't notice?’ My answer: ‘No. But it can write you a very creative excuse for the late submission.’

Welcome to the end of 2025 – when AI is supposed to be able to do everything! Except what really matters. Turing's legacy: why AI is not an all-rounder

Alan Turing – father of modern computer science and the man who made life difficult for the Nazis by cracking the Enigma code – would have been highly amused by today's AI hysteria. His Turing test was not intended to prove that machines can think, but that they can bluff like a poker pro with a pair of twos. Three hard facts:

AI is not a genius – it is a hard-working idiot. It combines data as if it were an over-motivated intern. Ask it why, and it stutters like a student in an oral exam.

Anything is possible! – Wrong. Turing proved with the halting problem that some questions are fundamentally unsolvable – even for the smartest AI. Example: ‘Will my start-up be successful?’ AI throws around statistics, but it can't even predict whether it will ever stop calculating. Let alone whether you're the type who still writes emails at 3 a.m... or the type who likes LinkedIn posts drunk at 3 a.m.

AI is a tool, not a magic wand. It can book appointments, answer FAQs and generate 10 versions of your CV.

But it won't:

Persuade your grandmother to finally use WhatsApp.
Convince your boss that you were really ill.
Or evade your taxes for you (yes, I've been asked that before).

The good news:

At getVIA, we use AI for what it can do:

Automate boring tasks (so you can take care of the important ones).
Recognising patterns that humans overlook (e.g. why your customers are particularly grumpy on Fridays at 3 p.m.).
Boosting creativity – by giving you 10 bad ideas from which you can filter out the one good one.

Conclusion: Why AI doesn't work miracles – and why that's okay

Imagine if Allen Turing and Kurt Gödel were on LinkedIn today. Turing would smile politely and say, ‘My machine can calculate anything... except whether it will ever finish.’ And Gödel would dryly remark, ‘Even if it finishes, it cannot prove that its answers are true.’

That's exactly the point: AI is like an overambitious maths student who solves every problem – except the ones that really matter. It can tell you how to optimise your business, but not why it works in the first place. It can help you make better decisions, but it will never decide for you. And it certainly won't answer your existential questions – except with the standard response: ‘I'm sorry, but I can't answer that question.’ AI is a supercomputer without gut instinct. It can analyse data, recognise patterns and even write texts that sound meaningful – but it doesn't understand what it's doing. Turing showed us that there are problems that even the perfect machine cannot solve (the halting problem). And Gödel proved that even the most logical AI cannot prove whether its own answers are true.

So: use AI for what it is – a powerful tool that takes work off your hands, recognises patterns and sometimes even makes you laugh. But don't expect it to tell you what to do. For that, you still have your brain. And your gut decisions. And – when in doubt – a good cup of coffee.",2,1764782749.0,AI_Agents,2,1.0,False

A bit nervous posting here - but I am hoping this awesome community can help guide me in the right direction. 

I used to be a ""gym rat"" - but I am going on 14 years now of essentially doing nothing. I worked out even while I was pregnant, cutting back on bench work because I was dealing with hyperemesis and got down to 125 lbs and felt very weak by 7 months (I'm 5'6, I was 135 before getting pregnant). I did a lot of strength training about an hour - 1.5 every day and about 30-45 min of jogging daily. It worked for me and I was very pleased with my body, health and energy levels. I stopped working out after I had an emergency cesarean and they stapled me up, followed by divorce and life getting significantly hard (emotionally and stress, I am LE). 

Now I am now 41 and in my 2nd year of therapy and ready to really start focusing on making some life style changes so I can feel better and keep up with my awesome 14 year old son. I have all kinds of work out equipment: home gym/weights/rower/tread. But my issue is this: I don't know where to start. I  have had to humble myself by accepting that I will no longer be able to do what I could do 14 years ago, on top of now weighing 210 pounds. But it's hard to get motivated when I feel like there's no hope and I'll just be stuck this way.

I am exhausted all the time and incredibly discouraged by some of the people around me and media reminding me that I'm ""older and female"" and even though I'm not in perimenopause  yet (per OB/dr evals), I that I should just accept that I'm going to be chunky, and maybe use a weight loss medication. When I spoke to my gen pratc about my weight struggles, I was told essentially the same thing, ""it's to be expected, you're older, female, put down the second taco"".  On a side note, I do not have PCOS, but my T levels are just a smidge high on the normal range. 

I do not want to use any medication. I take  supplements like berberine, raw liver, and other things that help female hormonal balance, etc. I walk around 10k steps a day, sometimes 6.5k if I'm on desk duty. I try to drink around 96 oz of water a day - I have one cup of coffee in the morning. And I'll do hot teas - soda isn't really my thing, except the occasional pre-biotic soda. My diet could really use improvement. I did a few months of cutting out all processed sugars and carbs, lost maybe 12 pounds but I lost nearly 3 inches around my belly. I gained it all back immediately when I went back ""normal"". So I am aware this is the biggest change I need to get on.

So here's the question: Is it really that difficult to get back into shape? I would like to get to 140 - that's a 70+ pound loss. Where can I start? I feel like I need to start on my core because it supports everything - right? I have the start of very mild arthritis in my lower back and it's only getting worse because of my weight. HIIT I feel at the moment is out of reach because I'm so weak. Yoga? Stretching? How can I start to rebuild a foundation?

Looking for some new perspective to help move things along. My kitchen and dining room are in one long narrow room that is 14’ x 32’ long. A hallway passes through the kitchen and there’s an exterior door on the other side so it’s really only 10’ x 13’ of usable kitchen space. I’ve included two photos of our current state (very 70’s!).

- I have three floor plans included. I’m leaning towards the first but it’s also essentially what I have today and it’s not great. I’m no designer so take it easy on me!

- window and door location on the drawings are current. We’d like to put in a bigger window centered over the sink/counters and floating shelves, and then a smaller door so we can make the kitchen bigger.

- we own a large set of new (to us) hickory cabinets but will also  need to buy new. We’ll be adding colored cabinets to add some fun flare to the room. Inspiration photos included.

- The very bottom (south wall) green cabinet situation is an idea for a floor to ceiling pantry. I’ve included an inspiration pic of a pantry made entirely out of stacked upper cabinets to keep it narrow yet usable. We don’t have a pantry today so a pantry is a priority.

- we’d like to put in a coffee wet bar which is what you’re seeing to the right of that bottom interior opening. Inspiration photo included. We’re trying to find ways to break up the big long room and create corners. We’ve struggled decorating one long room without lining the walls with furniture.

- we’d like to put in a built in dining nook of sorts to help break the long room up. The coffee bar would go all the way to the ceiling with built ins but the dining nook would only have a short open shelf cabinet to keep it open. I forgot to add this to one of the drawings but it is in the other two.

- we don’t love the current location of the oven since we have limited working space on either side, however it is easiest to keep it in place since the exhaust is piped in..

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0yGdNEWdn0&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0yGdNEWdn0&t=2s)

That idea stuck with me.

So I built my own study plan:

* **1,800 real-world example sentences** (generated with Gemini and then manually curated)
* **2,000 core vocabulary words** (to hit the 90–95% comprehension range)
* **180 days × 3 hours/day = 540 hours**
* **Daily target:** memorize 10 sentences + 20 words

My Goal: Go From Zero to A2/B1 Conversational French in 6 Months

I didn’t post for so long time. I just thought I can do it by myself. but you know, It really needs some will power to study 3 hours everyday. after day job, I just wanted to watch netflix stuffs and skiped a few days. so I just thought it’d be good to post daily for motivating myself to continue this stuff.

My last 3 logitech gaming mice, started double clicking within months of purchase. Compared to my very first gaming mouse the Logitech MX510, which lasted 5 years of Quake 3 arena abuse on a daily basis. And even then, it went out of service because the usb cable frayed a little too much which started to cause disconnects. 

Keyboard stories seem to be the same. A logitech purchased by me, mechanical, would often have keys not responding within the first 2 months. A friend, purchased their absolute high end one to have the same problem. 

Lately, however, I have started to test and rely on newer brands. Redragon is one of them. I do not know how anyone else here would feel about it, but till now I have had a good experience with them. Apart from the last mechanical keyboard I got from them on which I spilled coffee, making a few of its keys malfunction randomly. It worked great and even now still works but I cant rely on it for gaming because of the spill. 

At the moment I am now using a membrane keyboard from Redragon because I wanted something which had all the keys but in a smaller form factor. And I am happy to report it has been doing really well.

1pd9vzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/IllnessTracker/comments/1pd9vzy/want_to_seek_ultimate_truth_of_life/,want to seek ultimate truth of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I always appreciate suggestions from this group. During this fast I've used tips of drinking warm water and a little pickle juice, which have been great.

Are there any other foods I should probably keep away from that y’all would recommend? Also, what are your thoughts on decaf coffee? I think it has even less caffeine than matcha.

1pd9rsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1pd9rsv/aita_for_kicking_out_my_brother_after_he_moved_in/,AITA for kicking out my brother after he moved in 'temporarily' three years ago and I caught him running an OnlyFans with my wife?,"I'm 34, software engineer, work from home three days a week. My brother is 29 and has been ""finding himself"" since he dropped out of grad school. When he asked to crash at our place temporarily I said yes because that's what family does. My wife seemed fine with it. She's 31, works part-time as a yoga instructor.

The first year was whatever. He'd sleep till noon, play video games, occasionally apply to jobs he had no intention of taking. I paid for everything. Groceries, utilities, his phone bill because he couldn't afford it. My wife kept saying he just needed time and support.

Year two he started getting really into ""content creation."" Set up ring lights in the guest room, bought a nice camera with money I'm pretty sure came from my credit card he borrowed once and never gave back. He said he was building a personal brand. I figured YouTube or Twitch or something. My wife started helping him with his social media presence. They'd spend hours together working on captions and hashtags.

I didn't think anything of it. She was being nice to my brother. I was busy with work, pulling extra hours to cover all our expenses since I was supporting three people on one salary.

Then last month I came home early from a client meeting that got canceled. The house was quiet. I went upstairs to grab my laptop from the office and the door was locked. We never lock interior doors. I knocked and heard scrambling inside, my wife's voice saying ""just a second"" in this weird high-pitched way.

When she opened the door she was in lingerie I'd never seen before. My brother was behind her shirtless holding a camera. There was a setup with professional lighting and some kind of backdrop. My desk was pushed against the wall and they'd moved in a small couch I didn't recognize.

My wife started crying immediately, saying it wasn't what it looked like. My brother just stood there with his arms crossed. Then he said, ""We need to talk about this like adults.""

I lost it. Started yelling, asking what the hell was going on in my own house. My brother got defensive and said they'd been running an OnlyFans together for eight months. That they'd made over $200K and he was finally financially independent. He said I should be happy for him.

I told him to get out. Pack his shit and leave. My wife was still crying, begging me to calm down and let them explain. She said it was just business, that they never actually had sex, it was just photos and videos that looked suggestive. She swore nothing physical happened between them.

My brother laughed. Actually laughed. He said, ""Don't be such a prude. This is 2024. Sex work is real work.""

I told him he had 24 hours to be gone. He said fine, he didn't need my charity anymore anyway, and walked out. Just left. My wife followed him downstairs and I heard them talking in low voices for like 20 minutes before he finally took off.

She came back up and tried to explain everything. How they started it because she felt financially dependent on me and wanted her own income. How my brother suggested it because he knew about lighting and angles. How it was always supposed to be temporary but the money was too good. She kept insisting they maintained boundaries, never did anything explicit, it was all ""implied"" content.

I asked to see the account. She refused. Said it would just make things worse. That made me more suspicious so I did some digging and found it. They had almost 3,000 subscribers at $25 a month. The photos were way more than suggestive. They were posed to look like they were together. Intimate. There were comments from subscribers asking when they'd do more explicit content, asking if they were a real couple.

My brother had used the money to buy a Tesla. I saw it parked outside when I drove past our coffee shop the next day. He was sitting in there on his phone, saw me, and didn't even look guilty.

The real kicker came at Thanksgiving. My parents host every year and I wasn't going to go but my mom guilted me into it. My brother showed up like nothing happened. My wife stayed home, said she didn't feel welcome.

After dinner my brother cornered me in the garage. He said I was overreacting. That my wife and him had a creative partnership and a connection I was too boring and conventional to understand. He said I should be thanking him for helping her become financially empowered instead of being a jealous child about it.

I punched him. Split his lip. My dad had to pull me off. My whole family was staring. My mom started crying. My brother told everyone what happened, made it sound like he was just trying to help my wife start a business and I was being controlling and abusive.

Half my family thinks I'm TA for hitting him and kicking him out. They keep saying he's young and was just trying to make money, that I'm being too sensitive about the OnlyFans thing. My mom says I should apologize and let him come back until he finds an apartment.

My wife moved out last week. She's staying with her sister. She says we need counseling but I told her I want a divorce. She's been blowing up my phone saying I'm throwing away our marriage over a misunderstanding, that they never touched each other inappropriately.

But I saw those photos. I saw how they looked at each other in them. And he's my brother. In my house. Using my furniture and my space to do this behind my back for months.

Was I wrong to react the way I did?",16,1764781303.0,FoundandExpose,11,0.81,False

1pd9qqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/fit/comments/1pd9qqu/tips_for_fat_loss/,Tips For Fat Loss,"I wanted to share some tips i've learned over the years in both training and nutrition.



# Limited Equipment At Home:

  
If you are like me with limited equipment, say only have a 20kg(44lb) barbell or adjustable dumbells, For an way to make it more difficult, there's two options. By using Time Under Tension like Rest Pause, it will make it more difficult by slowing the movement down with a 1-3sec pause at the peak but there's another option, By using timed reps. I learned this when i tried out Cbum's PPL & its been a staple in my workouts ever since. 

Essentially you set your timer on for 40-60sec and keep going, this allows you to achieve failure easier with minimal equipment, especially useful for bodyweight, Combine this with a Opposing muscle group in a superset and you have a quality workout to maximize muscle usage, easier to reach failure and raise your heart rate, Place the timer on for 45 sec and you got a great workout.



# Walking Is Superior:

Walking for 30-60mins is really the best form of cardio, it taps directly into your fat stores and lets be honest, Treadmills and gym cardio machines are boring & 60min walking is generally about 6000-7000 steps. If you have to use the gym's machines for this, spend 10mins per machine to ensure you don't get bored and to keep it fresh



# Glycemic Load Is Important For Optimal Blood Sugar:

Not to be confused with Glycemic Index, This has been one of the best implementations i learned, GL is the effect food has on your blood glucose, which in turns impacts your insulin levels. GL is more important than GI. GI vs GL is like BMI vs Body Fat Percentage. By choosing foods high in fiber and low in GL, it keeps your blood glucose level & insulin low and leads to better hunger control & late day crashes. Food preparation also affects your GL level.



# Protein Intake:

This is a notorious take that the general population will argue always. In reality your protein intake for fat loss isn't actually 1g per 1lb, its a old and outdated system, Competitor Coaches recommends 1g per lb of goal weight however in reality for the general population on a fat loss journey is a lot more manageable. 1.3g for Fat loss & 1.6g for Appetite Control, this way you aren't sacrificing your carb intake nor fat intake & believe me from personal experience? Having low fat levels for extended periods is really not fun. Stick to 1.6g & you have a good balance.



# Tip For Late Night & Gamers:

 As a avid gamer myself struggling with late night hunger, one thing that is exceptionally useful to dealing with it, is have a cup of milk and sugar free herbal tea, being South African, i use Rooibos but i hear Chamomile is equally amazing for this. The sweetness curbs your cravings and the water fills you up & its calorie free, An easy way of dealing with hunger, especially if you do IF. Black Coffee is another great option but not recommended for late night",1,1764781244.0,fit,2,1.0,False
1pd9pe5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mercerinfo/comments/1pd9pe5/want_to_know_final_purpose_of_human_life/,want to know final purpose of human life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1764781172.0,Mercerinfo,0,0.5,False
1pd9pbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1pd9pbx/ran_into_a_staff_engineer_at_a_series_b/,ran into a staff engineer at a Series B healthtech ($150m valuation) who claims their 4-person team rewrote their entire patient data pipeline in 6 weeks using claude + cursor,"Met this woman at a coffee shop near the office - she overheard me talking about AI coding tools and jumped into the conversation. 9 years in backend systems, currently at a healthcare startup doing patient record management.

she casually drops that they just replaced a 3-year-old system that was ""held together with duct tape and prayers"" in a month and a half. with four people. including testing and migration.

obviously I had to hear this story.

their old system was classic tech debt hell - built by contractors who left, patched by whoever was around, documentation existed only in Slack threads. processing patient records was slow, the code was a mess, and nobody wanted to touch it because changing one thing broke three others.

management wanted a rewrite but estimated 6 months with 8 engineers. she convinced them to let her small team try a different approach - treat AI as a subject matter expert who never gets tired of explaining legacy code.

first two weeks were just archaeological work. they'd feed chunks of the old codebase to claude and ask ""what is this trying to do?"" not ""how does it work"" - what's the actual business logic buried in here?

claude would explain it in plain English. they'd verify with the product team. then they'd document the real requirements separate from the implementation. turns out half the complexity was solving problems that didn't exist anymore.

here's the genius part - they built the new system in parallel using what she calls ""specification-driven development."" write a detailed spec for each component in plain English, hand it to cursor, let it generate the implementation, then immediately write integration tests.

tests failed constantly at first. but that's the point - the failures told them exactly where the spec was unclear or where they'd missed edge cases. they'd refine the spec and regenerate. usually took 2-3 iterations per component.

she said the breakthrough moment was realizing they didn't need to review AI-generated code line-by-line. instead, they'd ask claude to review its own code against the spec. ""does this implementation actually handle all the requirements?"" the AI would catch its own gaps.

for the gnarly parts - complex HIPAA compliance stuff, tricky data transformations - they'd have claude generate multiple approaches and explain the tradeoffs. like having three senior engineers propose different solutions, except it takes 2 minutes instead of 2 days of meetings.

migration was the scary part. they used claude to write migration scripts AND validation scripts that compared old system output vs new system output on every single patient record. found 47 edge cases in production data that weren't in their test data.

went live 6 weeks in. not beta, not soft launch - full production cutover. zero data loss, zero patient impact. monitoring showed the new system was 12x faster and used 40% less infrastructure.

but here's what she was most excited about - the codebase is actually maintainable now. everything is documented, patterns are consistent, and new features that used to take weeks now take days.

their junior dev - fresh bootcamp grad, 4 months in - added a new data export format last week. solo project, start to finish, including tests and documentation. shipped in 3 days. she said that would've been impossible in the old system even for a senior engineer.

the CEO apparently walked into engineering and asked ""why did we ever hire contractors?"" she had to explain that AI is a tool amplifier, not a people replacement - you still need engineers who understand healthcare systems, compliance, and can architect good solutions.

other teams are now coming to them asking how they did it. backend team wants to rewrite their API gateway. data team wants to rebuild their analytics pipeline. she's worried about becoming the AI workflow consultant instead of actually engineering.

one weird thing she mentioned - they actually slowed down their PR approval process. sounds backwards, but they realized they needed MORE review time specifically to catch when the AI was being too clever. ""elegant"" code that nobody else can understand is still bad code.

they also banned cursor from directly accessing their production database. AI is great at generating queries, but one hallucinated WHERE clause could be catastrophic in healthcare. all DB access goes through a tested, human-reviewed data layer.

she did warn that this approach only worked because they had crystal clear requirements and good test coverage. trying to use AI to figure out what to build AND how to build it is apparently a recipe for disaster - you end up with working code that solves the wrong problem.

anyone else completely rewritten legacy systems like this? I'm curious if this velocity is reproducible or if they just got lucky with a well-scoped project.",0,1764781168.0,vibecoding,9,0.35,False

👉Before you point me to the dialing in troubleshooting guide, I’ve had this dialed in and have been using this machine for almost 3 years now! I’ve been using the same roast of beans from the same local coffee roaster, the same grinder with the same grind setting, and the same dose that I’ve had dialed in for a while. So now I’m wondering I’ve there’s an issue with my machine getting the right pressure? Maybe there’s a valve the can be replaced?

The groceries and meals are split... It's like we're very bad roommates and it's terrible.

Anyway, I've been craving cinnamon rolls for months but the idea of going into the kitchen and then having narc mother coming in to inspect that I haven't used her groceries and also to just bother me was too stressful so I kept putting off the cooking.

Today, I had the afternoon off from work. I decided to buy the ingredients and actually did it. Everyone was napping and the house was dark and quiet. I did most of the preparation in my room, it was great! But of course when I went to use the oven my mother showed up all bleary eyed and started making coffee and putting some dry dishes away. I had headphones on and completely ignored her but I was dreading her reaction. Her comments, and even the sound of her voice irritate me to no end. Thankfully, she didn't say anything and I took my baked, and beautifully golden brown, cinnamon rolls to my room. I could tell she was so angry because she hates when I cook nice things for myself.

I had one cinnamon roll and texted my sister, with whom I've had a very difficult relationship but now we're talking again because we ended up on the same side, but unfortunately she said was spending the night out...

Somebody told me this one day: ""just because the heirarchy in the family changed, don't assume your place has changed""... And just because the narcs have finally fully revealed themselves (parents and brothers) it doesn't mean that the ones being abused (my sisters and myself) have truly bonded. We're on friendlier terms, that's true, but in the end we're all alone.

I'm the youngest and the scapegoat and I'm still craving the warm cosy feeling of having a family. My sister telling me she's spending the night out when I was expecting her saddened me more than I thought. It's because I'd tricked myself into thinking I had gained a family member but in the end I'm still all alone.

I wish I had my own family. I wish I had you guys with me. We'd rant about our horrible families over cinnamon rolls.

I asked for logic, not opinions. Do you people know the difference? There are very few replies that are structured, objective, or can be verified.  

It was a question pertaining to one individual’s choice and not the general public. 

The question was “Why does someone call into work saying it’s to stormy to drive there, then leave their house thirty minutes to an hour later to run errands, get groceries and grab a coffee?”

A factual based observation would say if it’s too bad for one, then it’s too bad for the other. 

Somehow you guys have turned this into an argument (when there wasn’t one) about everybody driving in bad weather or that I’m asking why there are vehicles on the road. I asked neither. 

Logic: Reasoning based on evidence that is objective and systematic that can’t be tested or verified. 

Opinion: a belief that is subjective and influenced by personal perspective often shaped by emotions and not always provable.

1pd9l1n,https://i.redd.it/c4f8u1fpr05g1.jpeg,First bad review online in eight years.,"First and worst bad review ever at new gig

Story goes like this:
My background is 8 years of high volume restaurant by the beach in St Augustine, Fla.
Now new in Annapolis, MD. Taken a year off due to moving states, buying house, doing remodel projects for myself and others. Also suffering with chronic pain (pudendal neuralgia) after surgeries gone wrong in 2022. This gig is like a fresh start after being burned out on life. Last three years of figuring out life with less abilities have taken a toll on me physically and mentally. 

Couple in their 40s come in during lunch. I’m on my second double b2b, during my first week after training at a French restaurant. 
They ask about wine, I got them set up with samples. They ordered an appetiser and I ordered that. When I come back with the wine, they ask where the app is.. They start asking questions about our trout dish and a benedict platter. I answered those questions and asked if they wanted to order it. They said they were good with the app and wine for now. When the app shows up I ask them if they needed anything else. Said they were good.
I go and check like 5 times, asking if I could do anything else for them. They’re “good”.
Our family meal comes out, we eat. I check on them again, and suddenly it happens: “Where’s our food?”
I told them I was confused, I never rang anything in. They were confused as well. I told them I could still make it happen. But they wanted the check, understandably. When I went to the computer, he follows me, starts complaining. I told him I was sorry but I also checked on them like 5 times. I said it was a misunderstanding. Guy proceeds to say things like: “what am I gonna do now, I’m on a date with a fine woman,” and “this says a lot about your character”. Told him that was unfair and it was a misunderstanding and apologised. 
They leave and 30 minutes later this.

Things to know: I don’t drink. I have never had a bad review online. Feeling horrible about this. Management understands but still, not used to being dragged through the mud like that. 

Also, they didn’t know what type of wine they like but go to a French place. Never did they ask about the food in 40 minutes. And who says things like: I’m on a date with a fine woman lmao. Sounded cringey. Feeling like he just wanted to prove himself. And threw everything at me he possibly could in a review cause he had a glass of wine and felt like he needed to impress his date. Also, I don’t come around to “just say hi”..
Still overall depressed with my life because of my condition and this doesn’t help. New job, new motions. Doing bar drinks now for first time, including coffees. Been feeling suicidal lately because of stress in relationship, my condition and the new job where I feel like I don’t know wth I’m doing, after doing the same gig for 7 years.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Should I still meet her because she's old and a nice person? Am afraid she'll try to use the meet up to try to persuade me/my parents to use her as a realtor to sell our homes.,"My parents bought their house about 15 years ago and used a realtor who stayed very friendly with them for years. My parents used her to rent their house to 3 different tenants and she always kept in touch (on the off chance my dad decides to sell, which he has yet to). When I was 27 and buying my first home (2022), she was more than ready to help me!

The issue is that she was already around 75 when I was house hunting 3 years ago, and I realized she was a lot more complacent with me than she would've been had I been a stranger. She never drove me to showings (but she was older so I gave her grace). In fact, a few times I had to drive to her house, pick her up, and then drive her to see homes. Instead of her coming to me to have me fill out forms or give me info, she'd ask me to drive to her house.

She also pushed me toward the townhouse I bought, and it has been nothing but problems. It's not her fault but I also would've felt less guilty about walking away from buying altogether if she'd been a stranger. I feel like I overpaid (waived inspection and paid $20k over asking) and I have never been happy with it. She also did not give any small closing gift (like towels..) like she had with my parents, which is something most realtors do.

For the past two years I have had a lot of personal things going on, including ankle surgery and recovery. I am finally doing better, and she reached out wanting to grab coffee. We hadn't seen each other for over a year.

I told her I am super busy for the next two months (have a big exam and work is busy in Dec/Jan) and just came back from an overseas trip and am tired, which is true. She still seemed really eager to meet. If we do meet, it has to be near where she lives because she is older and had surgery herself. Her husband is also now in a nursing home. I would feel bad asking her to come to me (a 30 minute drive).

**The thing is, I would not mind going out of my way if we were actually friends**. But since using her as a realtor to buy my house I have felt like she saw me as a client and a friend at the same time, not just a friend. **It feels like she always had some level of ulterior motive with my parents and then with me.**

I do not know if I am being rude, overthinking this, or if it is reasonable to keep some distance. How do I handle this without feeling guilty and without committing to something I do not have time or emotional energy for right now?

1pd9gzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/1pd9gzg/question_for_pc_voters_about_rtowfh/,Question for PC Voters about RTO/WFH,"I'm curious to hear from PC voters and even some more conservative Liberal voters about their views on RTO (Return to Office) and WFH (Work from Home) as well as a more broad question at the end.

  
If a party other than the Conservatives were to introduce a policy in their campaign which made working from home a protected labour right if the job can be provably and demonstrably done from home, would that be an engaging policy in your opinion?

I know that the discussions around RTO/WFH have sometimes been divisive but the protected right to WFH has the potential to improve certain aspects of many people's lives. 

**Traffic/Commute Time:**

With everyone needing to commute to work, typically to the same places and at the same time, RTO will inevitably Increase traffic, increase the cost of transport including gas, parking, or even the cost of public transport fare. However, as an example, if 20% of workers are now able to WFH consistently if they choose to, that's a 20% reduction in traffic overnight. 

**Childcare:**

Parents can bring children to appointments during the day without taking time off of work. Parents of younger children who need to be dropped off and picked up from school can do so with less interruption of their work day. After school child minding won't be as necessary any more. 

**Food/Groceries:**

No or decreased need to purchase lunch/coffee/snacks at an increased cost near work, food could be prepared at home. This could also have a more positive health outcome since healthier food can be prepared at home rather than relying on heavily processed pre-made meals.

**Housing:**

More consistent access to WFH work could also allow people to live where housing is more affordable without sacrificing opportunity which could also revive small, rural towns and communities by bringing higher wages and increased local spending to those areas. Simultaneously decreasing the cost of housing in larger cities due to decreased demand. 

**Public Services:**

It would also lower the cost of some public services like Ontario Works and ODSP because a lot of the barriers to work would be eliminated for many disabled people or non-disabled adults whose current work options are limited due to commitments in the home (i.e. caring for children or elderly relatives). 

**Healthcare:** 

It could also lower health care costs by decreasing stress-related illnesses as commutes can be stressful and often demand that you be sitting and immobile for prolonged periods of time, something which has been repeatedly demonstrated to be bad for our overall health. It could also result in fewer sick days used, and fewer sick workers out in public. Not eliminating this entirely obviously but a decrease is still a good thing with a positive impact. 

  
All of the above being said, if a political party were to introduce this policy and show evidence for the above benefits, would that be a policy which could sway you to vote for that party rather than the Conservatives?

A follow up question, what other policies could the other parties introduce or problems they could tackle (which are within the province's purview) that would convince you to change which party you vote for?

I’m dealing with cognitive dissonance regarding an experience and please help me understand. I went through a difficult divorce 3 years ago and was overwhelmed by financial loss, young kids, no support system and harrasment by ex. I had a well paying job and was working on rebuilding but very depleted after years of abuse. 

  
One of my childhood acquaintances reached out inviting us over. our kids got along well and I was comfortable as our parents were good friends. We met a few times and I gradually opened up about divorce and all conversations were in front of his wife. They were disciplined, successful professionals and seemed to have a happy and stable marriage. I felt a little off one evening when he brought up topics about dating etc and decided to pull back. We got in touch again when I needed help with something a month later. He is logical, grounded and I found his problem solving approach very helpful. His wife and kids were out of town and he suggested we could meet at a coffee shop. We went to the coffee shop and i felt safe and was particularly in a low phase and needed to talk. At closing time, he offered we could go to his home if I was ok and I did. I know it’s a bad idea and not right and I should not have gone.

I trusted him and we were talking about childhood, sharing some jokes and relaxed. I gradually startrd talking about challenges, grief etc. I was not tearful, just alone and starving for companionship and support. He was attentive, offering practical solutions. He did bring up a few sexual topics and stopped when I did not respond. when I expressed my disgust for porn, he said all men watch open and those that say they don’t are probably lying. We were on 2 different couches with zero physical contact. Early mmorning, he moved next to me and gently put arm around my shoulder. I moved away and said it’s time to leave and he did not stop. I went home felt confused and horrible. I called later and said I should not have come home in his wife’s absence and apologized. He kept it neutral. The next 2 days he started texting me which sounded playful and nothing inappropriate . I freaked out, called him I’m not interested in flirting and blocked his number and stayed no contact.

i experienced shame, guilt and fear after that and labeled him a predator in my mind and closed that chapter. Two years later I met him at a party and saw him as a god husband, father and a son. His wife and kids are thriving and happy and teen girls adore him. My mind is spinning  if I overreacted but also could not process his  intention that night. I will continue limited contact. Did he have any intentions if possible or was it just trying to help me and poor judgement on our part? Was he just an honorable man who probably felt some connection or attraction and stayed in line and respected my boundaries or a man who appears perfect but open to an opportunity? He never reached out after I blocked him and our interaction at the party was brief, cordial and warm. I’m so cynical about men but also don’t want to misinterpret decent men. what are your thoughts?

About Me

Hi, I’m 37M, 5'7, and I work from home for both EU and US companies, so weekdays are usually packed for me. Pag weekends naman, I like going out, exploring new spots, or grabbing coffee to decompress after a long week. I’m a foodie who enjoys simple but meaningful dates and trying out new places.

I’m Catholic if that matters to you, and I used to be a church keyboardist and guitarist. I can sing too, so music has always been part of my life. I enjoy trying new things, whether it’s a café, a hidden restaurant, or something spontaneous to make weekends more fun. I don’t have a car, but I do have a stable and good job. And syempre, kapag date, ako sasagot sa gastos.

When it comes to relationships, I appreciate someone who communicates well, updates naturally, and knows how to handle things with maturity. I value emotional intelligence and calm conversations because they keep things steady and healthy. I’m not into drama, and I prefer a relationship that’s simple, honest, and grounded.

About You

I’m hoping to meet someone petite, chinita, at maputi, ideally between 27 to 35 years old, with a stable job and living within Metro Manila. Bonus points if you’re from North Caloocan or QC. Mas okay if you’re also a foodie and someone who enjoys trying new things.

The gut issues overshadow everything else I deal with. If I didn’t have the gut issues I’d feel pretty ok. 

I have some other symptoms like chest tightness, shortness of breath, and a weird fluttery feeling around my heart. These are all rare and don’t bother me that much. I also have on/off fatigue and muscle weakness that’s gotten a little better within the last year.

I got tested for every other thing that could be affecting my gut and nothing really showed up except for leaky gut. A Lyme test was a last resort.

I had a stock single shot basket from ECM on my Profitec Go, I set it up that I came around with the 20g in 24 seconds-ish and was happy with the results.

I bought the 12g ECM IMS Precision basket for single shots, I change 0 settings on anything to see where we stand, and the coffee comes out pouting at around 4 times the speed.

I grind finer, stick to the 12.3g-12.5g range, and then I get to the limit of before the machine sounds like it is. It still comes out too fast, around 20g in 11 seconds but better. So then I try onwards, after looking at Youtube videos and what ""chirping"" sounds like; I turn it finer to set it up that the 24g come out in around 22 seconds, there is not as much crema but its fine, however. My Eureka now sounds like the sound clip that is attached, is this sound OK?

Thanks a lot for the help beforehand,

1pd98ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/Torchwood/comments/1pd98ct/rec_list_older_torchwood_fics_that_were_never/,Rec List: Older Torchwood fics that were never transferred to AO3 [Part 1 A-M],"This list is made up entirely of older Torchwood fanfiction whose authors never transferred the stories to AO3 (therefore the majority of fics are pre-2011). I found most of these by going through all the posts on the communities [twstoryfinder](https://twstoryfinder.livejournal.com/), [twgenrefinders](https://twgenrefinders.livejournal.com/), and [torchwood\_fic](https://torchwood-fic.livejournal.com/) on LJ, as well as finding other people’s old fic rec lists, other lj communities, and my own old bookmarks. Most stories link to livejournal, some to [fanfiction.net](http://fanfiction.net) and a few to other sites like whofic, insanejournal, dreamwidth, and even the wayback machine. These fics span a wide range of lengths, fanfic genres, and writing styles, although most are longer than 1k. However, I am fairly picky when it comes to fic quality, so these are only the ones out of everything I read that I thought were very good. Any warnings, pairings, or clarifying notes I might want to write are in brackets. All fics are either gen or Jack/Ianto unless otherwise specified. This list is alphabetical by title.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1pd95ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy_Universe/comments/1pd95ni/surgery_saga_part_2/,Surgery Saga Part 2,"Setting: The auto shop. It smells like oil, rubber, and old coffee. Dez’s comfort zone. Tools clang. A radio mutters classic rock from somewhere behind an engine block.

 

Desdemona is bent over the open hood of a beat-up sedan, tightening a bolt with the exact combination of precision and muscle memory that she’s built over years.

 

Rick is at the next bay, soldering something that looks like it shouldn’t be legal. For a moment, everything is normal.

 

Then— Desdemona’s hand freezes. Not trembles. Not slips. Just… stops.

 

She stares at the wrench like it’s suddenly foreign. Her breath catches. Rick notices.

 

Rick: “You good?”

 

It’s gentle, too gentle. Her jaw tightens.

 

Desdemona: “Don’t.”

 

Rick raises both hands in surrender: “Just checking.”

 

She sets the wrench down carefully, like it might break.

 

Desdemona: “What if I forget how to do this?”

 

Rick blinks. She keeps going, words tumbling out, brittle around the edges.

 

Desdemona: “What if I wake up and I can’t fix anything? Or I forget torque ratios. Or how to read an engine by sound. Or forget which wires feed into what. What if my hands don’t remember? What if I don’t remember?”

 

She laughs, sharp, too loud: “God, who am I without knowing how to take things apart?”

 

Rick leans against the workbench, not too close. Not crowding her. Just present.

 

Rick answers with soft honesty: “You’ll still be you.”

 

Dez scoffs: “Yeah? Says who?”

 

Rick: “Me. Your doctor. Your parents. Pookie. Angel. Your kid. Your cat. The entire dysfunctional roster of St. Somewhere.”

 

He shrugs: “Also the laws of neuroplasticity, but that didn’t sound as poetic.”

 

Desdemona rubs the back of her neck.

 

Desdemona: “But what if the surgery changes something about how my brain works? What if I’m not good at this anymore?”

 

Rick nods and gives her a half smile

 

Rick: “Then we figure it out. Together. Shift gears. Relearn. Rebuild. You’ve rebuilt more engines than I’ve rebuilt firewalls. And that’s saying something.”

 

She almost smiles. Almost.

 

Rick, softly: “You’re scared.”

 

And that’s it. That’s the sentence that hits her in the sternum like a hammer. Her whole body goes rigid. For a moment she almost vibrates. The air around her shifts, energy crackling.

 

Rick flinches as she becomes QUEEN KEPPRA. Imperial posture. Electric tension. Voice sharp enough to slice steel.

 

Queen Keppra: “Of course I’m scared! Someone is going to crack my skull open like a pistachio, Rick!”

 

She paces, gesturing wildly.

 

Queen Keppra: “What if they take something I need? What if they take something I love? What if something stupid gets damaged–memory, speech, filters– I mean, I barely have a filter NOW. And don’t tell me filters belong on cigarettes!! You’re not my father!”

 

Rick tries again.

 

Rick: “Dez–”

 

Queen Keppra explodes: “AND STOP ASKING IF I’M OKAY!”

 

Her voice reverberates off the metal walls. A wrench clatters to the ground.

 

Queen Keppra: “I AM FINE. STOP WORRYING ABOUT ME.”

 

The shop falls silent. Even the radio cuts out. Rick waits. Not scared. Not defensive. Just… patient.

 

After a moment, Dez deflates. Queen Keppra fades like smoke.

 

She presses her palms to her eyes.

 

Desdemona, voice small and quiet: “I’m not fine.”

 

Rick steps closer.

 

Rick: “I know. You don’t have to be.”

 

Her shoulders shake once, half a laugh, half a sob.

 

Desdemona: “It’s just… I love this job. I love knowing things. Knowing machines. Being good at something. And what if this surgery takes that?”

 

Rick reaches out, placing a hand gently on hers.

 

Rick: “They’re not taking anything. They’re giving you a chance.”

 

He lifts the wrench she dropped.

 

Rick: “And hey– if anything feels different afterward… I’ll teach you whatever you need. Torque ratios, wiring, engine song… We’ll relearn it together.”

 

She takes the wrench back. Her grip steadies.

 

Desdemona grumbles, but there’s no heat in it: “You’re really annoying when you’re helpful.”

 

Rick: “That’s what my Mother says too.”

 

Desdemona snorts. She breathes easier. The weight in her heart doesn’t seem as heavy. Friends seem to have that effect.",2,1764779970.0,Epilepsy_Universe,1,1.0,False

1pd91jh,https://i.redd.it/usifub40o05g1.png,[Advent of Cocktails 2025: December 3] Pantheon,"Welcome to **Day 3** of the [Advent of Cocktails 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1p1dkeh/advent_of_cocktails_2025/)! Today's cocktail is...

# Pantheon

\_\_\_

**History**

The Pantheon is a modern cocktail created by Tokyo bartender Daisuke Ito, owner of Land Bar Artisan and widely regarded for his technical skill and dedication to refining classic recipes rather than inventing new ones. Despite his usual preference for updating historical drinks, Ito devised the Pantheon in response to a request for an original recipe for Nicholas Coldicott’s cocktail book, *Tokyo Cocktails* published in 2019.

Ito's approach to the Pantheon began not with the base spirit but with Bénédictine, a French herbal liqueur he felt was underutilized in contemporary bars despite its universal presence. His goal was to create a drink that bartenders around the world could easily reproduce without obscure ingredients.

Ito intentionally avoided specifying a particular style of Scotch, arguing that the drink works with a wide range of expressions—from blended whiskies like Dewar’s to single malts such as Talisker. Lemon juice was selected for its compatibility with high-proof liqueurs like Bénédictine.

After experimenting with several naming options, Ito settled on the name “Pantheon”, chosen for its memorable sound rather than for any historical or symbolic reference.

Following the book’s publication, the Pantheon began appearing in notable cocktail bars:

* **Bar Trench** (Tokyo), where bartender Rogerio Igarashi Vaz served it with **Cragganmore 12**, emphasizing the whisky’s herbal character.
* **Ray Cocktail and Bite** (Bangkok), using **Monkey Shoulder blended whisky**.
* **Bar Glide** at the St. Regis (Bangkok), where the team selected **Chita grain whisky** for the base.

Bartenders noted that although the ratio initially seemed unconventional, the drink delivered surprising balance and complexity.

The Pantheon stands out in an era when many new cocktails rely on elaborate syrups, infusions, or specialized equipment. Its simplicity—three widely available ingredients, straightforward technique—was intentional. Ito hoped to create a drink that could travel far beyond its origins and be ordered in bars decades into the future.

While still young, the Pantheon’s adaptability, bar-friendliness, and early international uptake suggest it may have staying power. As Ito notes, his aspiration is modest yet telling: that one day, a guest will ask him whether he knows how to make a Pantheon.

*Source: Punchdrink.com,* [*The Pantheon Is a Japanese Modern Classic in the Making*](https://punchdrink.com/articles/pantheon-cocktail-japan-modern-classic/)

\_\_\_

**Pantheon**

* 1 oz (30 ml) blended Scotch whisky
* ½ oz (15 ml) Bénédictine D.O.M. liqueur
* ½ oz (15 ml) freshly‑squeezed lemon juice

1. *Add all ingredients into a cocktail shaker filled with ice.*
2. *Shake vigorously for about 10‑12 seconds to chill and dilute.*
3. *Fine‑strain into a chilled coupe or Nick & Nora glass.*

\_\_\_

**Variations**

A sign of the cocktail’s early acceptance is the emergence of variations:

* Charles Schumann of Schumann’s Bar (Munich) created a version blending Bénédictine and **yellow Chartreuse**.
* Ito himself developed several riffs, including:
   * **Rum** Pantheon
   * **Tequila** Pantheon
   * **Calvados** Pantheon (which he cites as particularly successful)
   * Versions made with **Japanese whisky**

Though the original specs are modest, many bartenders recommend scaling up the recipe by **1.5× or even double** to fill a coupe more satisfyingly.([cocktaillove.com](https://www.cocktaillove.com/recipes/pantheon/))

Difford’s Guide suggests adding a couple of drops of saline solution—or even just a merest pinch of salt—to enhance balance and bring out complexity in the flavors.([diffordsguide.com](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/25701/pantheon))

Mandingo Graves Episode 2

The meeting room next to the Kodiak High library was a small, miserable box, smelling faintly of decades-old floor wax and failure. Dust motes danced in the lone overhead light above the display of tarnished football trophies. Marcus Thorne, clad in a shockingly bright, red Alabama Crimson Tide blazer—utterly unsuited for Alaskan weather—paced the room. He had a stack of brochures so glossy they seemed to sweat and a legal pad clutched in a white-knuckled grip.
​“Look, fellas, I flew thirty-six hours—thirty-six!—to get from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to Kodiak Island,” Thorne grumbled, checking his watch again. “I took a bus, a ferry, and what I’m pretty sure was a snowmobile taxi. I need to get this kid's letter of intent signed and get back before my fingers snap off. Where is this... Mandingo?”
​Ulabar and Uck sat stiffly at a laminate table. Uck, attempting to be subtle, was using a paperback copy of Moby Dick as a coaster for his tepid coffee. They watched the door with the anxiety of men waiting for a bomb to drop.

​The door creaked open, groaning in protest.
​Mandingo Graves entered, carrying his whalebone club, and the small room instantly shrank. He was wearing a tattered, thin Orcas t-shirt, entirely unaffected by the cold, and his sheer bulk seemed to displace the air itself.
​Mandingo’s huge eyes fixed on Thorne’s attire. “Small man smell like flowers and too much running.”

​Marcus Thorne froze mid-pace, the rehearsed, welcoming smile vanishing. He took a hasty breath, adjusting his tie. “Mr. Graves! What an absolute privilege. Marcus Thorne, Alabama Crimson Tide. We are offering you a full-ride scholarship to play quarterback. A four-year commitment to a premier Division I program.”
​Thorne slid a shimmering brochure across the table. It featured pictures of palm trees and a stadium that Mandingo probably could have fit his entire Kodiak village inside.

​Mandingo picked up the brochure, studying it with deep suspicion, then poked a picture of the Head Coach with his massive index finger. “Tiny Ball man. Speak loud?”
​“He speaks very loud,” Thorne assured him, a little too quickly. “And very strategically. We are talking about the SEC, Mandingo. We’re talking about national championships, professional futures, and an education that sets you up for life!”
​Mandingo pointed to the word on the brochure's header. “What is this word? Edu-kay-shun?”
​Ulabar leaned forward, intervening before Mandingo could attempt a physical demonstration of confusion. “He means, what are the primary focuses of the academic program, Mr. Thorne? Mandingo is very goal-oriented.”

​“Right, right. Well, it’s all laid out here,” Thorne said, relieved. “It involves a rigorous academic schedule alongside your football requirements. We need to maintain a 2.5 GPA, pass our core classes... We'll need your transcript and, of course, your SAT or ACT scores.”
​Mandingo’s face, usually set in a fierce earnestness, contorted with genuine panic. He stared at Ulabar. “Scores? Mandingo score touchdowns. Mandingo not score numbers on paper.”
​Uck delivered a swift, hard kick to Ulabar’s shin under the table.
​Ulabar didn’t flinch, but sweat beaded on his temple. “Ah, yes. The scores. Mandingo’s... academic aptitude is currently being assessed through a new, culturally sensitive tribal standard. We are awaiting the official translation. The important thing is his athletic profile. He runs the forty-yard dash in 4.5 seconds. While carrying a whalebone club.”
​Thorne’s eyes, which had glazed over at the mention of the ""tribal standard,"" immediately came alive at the speed. “4.5 at 239 pounds?! That’s… incredible. Listen, we can get him set up with a tutoring team, remedial classes, whatever he needs to be eligible. We just need him to sign this letter of intent. This guarantees his scholarship.”
​Thorne presented a folder crammed with legal documents. 
Mandingo picked it up, finding it alarmingly light. “Paper thin. Mandingo use thin paper for fire. Keep feet warm.”
​“No! No, Mandingo, this paper is very important!” Thorne nearly shrieked. “It is promise! It means you come to Alabama! It means guaranteed Ball!”

​Mandingo put the folder down to grab his club. “Promise is in the blood. Paper is for burning. But... you say guaranteed Ball?”
​“Guaranteed, Mandingo. Four years of the best Ball in the nation!”

​A deep, satisfied smile, frightening in its intensity, spread across Mandingo’s face. “Good. Mandingo like guarantee. If Mandingo make many touchdowns, Alabama give scholarship to Ice Tooth?”

​Thorne glanced desperately at Ulabar, who merely offered a small, helpless shrug.
​“We… we have a very competitive veterinary program, Mandingo,” Thorne managed weakly. “The point is, you’re in. You’re our guy. Now, tell me about the Anchorage Mammoths next week. What’s your game plan?”
​Mandingo tapped his club against the floor once, the sound echoing sharply and rattling the nearby trophies.
​“Mammoths big. But Mammoths soft. Mandingo run fast like wind spirit. Mandingo hit hard like mountain falling. Mandingo make quarterback run. Then Mandingo make touchdown. No more high school Ball after this. Mandingo go to big Ball place.”
​He grabbed the legal folder, rolled the expensive documents into a tight, ignored scroll, and tucked it casually into his pants like a forgotten fishing lure. He then turned and strode out of the office, leaving Marcus Thorne standing with his jaw hanging open, staring at the empty doorway.

​Uck took a slow, measured sip of his coffee. “Well, at least he didn’t pay you with caribou hair this time.”
​Ulabar stood, retrieving the glossy, crushed brochure from the table. “We have a week to explain what a ‘GPA’ is. And where exactly the nearest glacier is to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for Ice Tooth.”",0,1764779623.0,CFB25,2,0.5,False

He sells 250g & 500g bags primarily targeted to espresso enthusiasts - but the branding is actually really nice to look at and caters towards espresso mainly.  It's one of those bags that has printing all over (unlike the ones with plain color with a standard info label on top), in super nice colors and very attractive artwork. It does draw your attention to the bag if you'd see it in a retail shop. 

However, his business is primarily e-Commerce so you only get to see the packaging after you have made the purchase. 

I did point this out to him that a simple label with a nice logo and interesting text might be more than enough as it's a fairly cheaper option for him - he argued that a lot of people like to have a ""Nice looking coffee bag"" at home vs a plain labeled bag which got me thinking - how much of your buying decision actually revolves around what the packaging looks like?

Personally, I buy 250g bags - And couldn't care less on what they look like as long as they contain the bean I want. 99% of the times, I'll immediately transfer the beans into my airtight coffee jar and throw out the bag - but with that said, if I stroll into a shop and see a nicely packaged coffee bag - I'll definitely check it out! 

  
Any thoughts? - Yes, he is on here also so will see this thread. (Hey Jason). ",0,1764779595.0,espresso,6,0.5,False

So i just began my fragrance-journey like a month ago. I researched some gourmands and clean/fresh scents here on reddit, looked at the notes, read some reviews and ordered a bunch of samples. I got some very popular ones but i only like a few of them. I'm wondering if yall can give me recommendations based on what i like and dislike(cause i dislike a few that are loved by many others)? I'd appreciate it since i'm super new to the fragrance game🙌 (I got some more samples coming in the mail, will add after i've tried them😄)

Ps: i hate patchouli. I can somehow ALWAYS smell it and it stays on my skin for a long time😵‍💫

❤️Like: Guerlain - Aqua Allegoria Rosa Verde EDT: perfect fresh and light cucumber, rose and mint for me, in love with this

Diptyque - Eau Rose EDP: very nice, gentle and photorealistic rose with a little twist of chamomile and artichoke, dries down to a wonderful skin scent

Kerosene - Follow EDP: very nice sweet coffee, not as cloying as followed

Zoologist - Bee EDP: i like that it's not just honey but also beeswax and pollen, it's not overly sweet

Billie Eilish - Eilish #1 EDP: red fruity opening and a gentle, smooth vanilla base, doesn't last super long but very delicious

Montblanc - Signature EDP: creamy, slightly sweet, fresh and a hint of fresh laundry, might become my signature scent

Initio - Musk Therapy EDP: Also creamy and fresh with a slight fruity mandarine note, also signature potential

Zarkoperfume - The Muse EDP: smells exactly like a laundromat, i do prefer it on clothes rather than skin tho

Perfumer's Workshop - Tea Rose EDT: photorealistic rose but a bit heavier, reminds me of classic old rose soap. Not sure if i wanna get a full bottle

👎🏼Dislike: Dolce & Gabbana - Light Blue EDT: zitric, fresh and minimally floral. Will use up but don't like it enough to buy

Montale - Intense Cafe EDP: I get no coffee from this, just a slightly too sweet rose and a bit floral, won't even use it up

Kenzo - Amour EDP: sweetly fresh, slightly creamy and powdery, rice note in the dry down, timeless feminine, too boring for me

Van Cleef & Arpels - Moonlight Cherry EDP: almond, cherry, minimal rum, slightly creamy, not too sweet. A bit boring, will not buy

💀Hate: Hermes - Ambre Narguile EDP: this ones just sweet to me. Too sweet. And not anything specific. Unoriginal and too much imo

Snif - Crumb Couture EDP: every gourmand lover i've listened to has been praising this but i get jammy croissant for like 2 seconds before it turns disgusting. Can't even reeally describe it. It smells like bad bread. Not moldy bread; just disgusting bread. Too dry, too bready idk really weird

Montale - Chocolate Greedy EDP: every gourmand lover also seems to love this one but the fruits makes it sour in a way that's disgusting to me. I do like the cocoa powder/chocolate note, i wish there was no fruits in this🙁

Tom Ford - Vanille Fatale EDP: barely vanilla, mostly frangipani with a slight mahagoni undertone, patchouli in the drydown

Clean - Warm Cotton EDP: smells like zitric toilet cleaner with a mix of fresh laundry to me, hate it",2,1764779221.0,FemFragLab,10,1.0,False

Transfemme, bi, queer, AUDHD.

It really feels like since identifying as transfemme and socially transitioning dating has become extremely flaky.

I don’t use the apps, but it’s not particularly hard to meet queer women IRL who say they are interested in going for a cute drink or coffee… we will swap details but when it comes to actually going on a date… it’s just impossible!

This has happened three times now - they will say “sorry I’m just so busy I’ll let you know” 2 weeks later nothing so I ask again… same response. When I ask “are you sure you want to it’s really fine if you don’t but please tell me“ they always say yes… and then never agree to a time. After a couple of times I just give up.

it’s been driving me crazy and the RSD is not fun. I feel like giving up entirely and I honestly don’t understand how people can say they are interested and then not show up.

1pd8nor,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AdAccording8979/comments/1pd8nor/retail_storytelling_turning_everyday_products/,Retail Storytelling Turning Everyday Products Into Emotional Experiences,"In today’s competitive retail world, customers are no longer moved by just price or product; they're drawn to *stories*. Every purchase is emotional, whether it’s a cup of coffee that brings comfort, a pair of shoes that inspires confidence, or a phone that makes someone feel connected. Retail storytelling turns ordinary items into meaningful experiences and that’s what keeps customers coming back.

# 1. Start with “Why,” Not “What”

People connect with purpose. Instead of focusing on product details or discounts, share the reason behind your brand. Why did you start? What change do you want to bring? A powerful “why” builds emotional trust and makes customers feel they’re part of something bigger than a transaction.

# 2. Make the Customer the Hero

The best stories don’t spotlight the brand, they highlight the customer. Show real-life scenarios where your products make life easier, better, or more joyful. When customers see themselves in your story, your products become part of their identity.

# 3. Use Visuals to Tell Your Story

Your store layout, packaging, and digital content all communicate your story visually. Use consistent colours, imagery, and tone across social media, website, and physical spaces. A cohesive visual story creates familiarity and emotional comfort two key drivers of brand loyalty.

# 4. Create Memorable Moments

Even small gestures can tell powerful stories. A personal note with a purchase, a loyalty message after checkout, or a thank-you email can turn a simple sale into a heartwarming experience. These “micro-stories” make customers feel seen and valued.

# 5. Combine Data with Emotion

Technology plays a major role in personalising your storytelling. Analysing sales data, buying patterns, and preferences helps you craft messages that resonate with individual customers offering the right product, at the right time, with the right tone.

# How Piggy Bank POS Helps You Build That Connection

**Piggy Bank POS** isn’t just a payment system it’s a complete retail growth partner designed to help you understand, engage, and delight your customers. From tracking sales and inventory to analysing customer behaviour and automating loyalty rewards, it helps you make smarter decisions and create emotional connections that last.

I am a revert and my husband and I have been going through a rough patch. Yesterday he asked me to pack my things and leave. I am currently staying with my Aunt. I am early twenties, and don’t know much about talaq or legal divorce. I feel heartbroken and want to fix our problems within our marriage since I really do love him, but he feels that these problems will never change. 

This morning he messaged me asking me to meet him at a coffee shop because he wants to give me a letter and ask if I am willing to proceed with a joint separation.

I really love this man. He has went to the imam for guidance before deciding divorce and the imam told him to talk with me to reconcile but due to external pressure and him deciding our relationship will not work with the external pressure, so I don’t think there’s much opportunity for reconciliation. 
We have only lived together since this January and had our nikkah February 7th. We are legally married on March 9th, all in this year. 

Edit to add: I am in Ontario, Canada. Not too sure about separation and divorce here

Any advice or kind words are truly appreciated",1,1764778856.0,MuslimDivorce,4,0.99,False
