I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Coffee Crisps in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",1,1729483937.0,UofT,0,1.0,False
1g8h9y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1g8h9y7/first_and_last_season_w_bixi/,First and Last Season w/ Bixi,"* The grey bikes are terrible. They are the lowest quality bicycles I've ever had the displeasure to attempt to ride. They make every single cheap bike I've ever had in my lifetime seem like expensive luxury road bikes. The electric bikes are the only bikes worth riding especially if you aren't riding casually, and are using it to get to and from work/school like myself, and it's hardly a guarantee you'll be able to use one.

* For people who don't have data plans (like myself), the Bixi terminals that don't let you rent a bike with the card linked to your account are inconvenient. Even if I did have a data plan, why should I need to use more gigs to rent a bike when all I should need is my credit/debit card? The ability to rent from the app should be an additional feature for simplicity and ease of use, not the exclusive way to rent from some terminals.

* Even when the terminal allows you to rent a bike with your payment card, they are typically very buggy, damaged or simply do not work.

* A large majority of the docks across the city, at least one per terminal, are prone to malfunction. The amount of times I've nearly been made late to work because I tried to rent a bike but the dock refused to unlock it, requiring me to quickly think of a work around! If I need to constantly consider leaving way earlier than I should have to just because I need to plan ahead for the inevitable failures with Bixi, why even bother paying for it and putting myself through that heartache? I might as well save energy and to some extent money, and take the metro and bus which are unfortunately way more reliable than this bike sharing service. Hearing the loud buzzing of a malfunctioning dock which won't unlock your desired bike is vexing beyond understanding.

* Service as a whole is generally underwhelming, inefficient and not worth the trouble. From an outside perspective, Bixi seemed like a convenient alternative to public transport or risking the chance that my own bike might not end up in my possession anymore. However, though I expected convenience, I was met with headache after headache, problem after problem, inconvenience after inconvenience. It simply makes no sense for me to continue paying for this service if I had more peace of mind traveling the city without it.

The quality of the bikes are bad. The quality of the docks are bad. The quality of the terminals are bad. One time, in a rush to work, I realized the bike I was on had a punctured tire. I docked it at another station to try to switch bikes, and though the dock locked, the app (I was observing this on my phone with the Wifi from a nearby coffee shop) insisted that I was still on the initial bike that I had docked. I waited ten additional minutes that I really couldn't afford to waste hoping the app would update, but it didn't. Finally, I ended up having to take a taxi to work, costing me even more money, time and peace of mind. That's just one of many incidents.

It's come to a point where I'm lucky if there are absolutely no issues in renting and using a Bixi bike. 1/6 times there are absolutely no issues, and those odds are too low for this to be worth the money.

And now? Just before I tried to take a blue bike home from work, only to see that my account was suspended due to an error with my billing information. I ended up wasting another thirty minutes on hold for customer support, while I was checking the app to try to fix the issue. The e-mail sent to me to notify me of my suspension linked me to resources to fix my problem but the links were dead. My card had money, and I had renewed my membership ten days ago with the payments from this cycle due in November.... ???? Still on hold with customer support, I decided to use the ""Rent an Additional Bike"" feature which charges you additionally per minute... and it works? So my card suddenly can't be accepted and my account is ""suspended"" but everything's still A-OK when I decide to use the more expensive option. That totally makes sense! I get home and log in to my account on the website, see that there are no outstanding payments due (until November) but somehow, because they were ""Unable to verify my payment information"" my account was suspended. BUT SOMEHOW MY CARD STILL GOT ACCEPTED TO RENT ANOTHER BIKE. This was the last straw and I'm not going out of my way to waste time on hold with customer support to both MAYBE fix this and MAYBE get the amount I was charged for the bike reduced given yet another inconvenience with this service.

I'm rambling at this point but I don't actually see how anyone is satisfied with this service. Maybe it used to be better in the past but right now I'm not sure how they're making business with how bad the service is. I don't even use it daily and I'm constantly trying to stay one step ahead of this garbage service to avoid being late to the places I need to go. I'm done with it at this point and am more than delighted to cancel and never look back. Thank you for reading.",1,1729483850.0,montreal,0,1.0,False

1g8h8jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g8h8jv/the/,the,"*Insert im on my phone disclaimer here*

So I moved into a sharehouse late last year with strangers, all was well and I got along with rm1 well at the start. We wanted similar things at home etc.

It's important to note that rm1 made it clear she didn't have time to play tour guide and help me make friends (I was new to the city but knew a few people) and I said that's fine, I'm a big girl and I'll adventure on my own. 

Now this year has been shit for me, I've had some things come up that have hurt my mental health and it's just been a big year. This means I haven't been my normal bubbly chatty self all the time. I also enjoy quiet at home anyway so not a big deal. 

Rm1 has also had a rough year, studying honours at a very high level university and I have dealt with and supported her through countless breakdowns and rough patches. I've messaged her friends and told them she needs them, done her chores around the house to lighten her burden. I even adjusted my wfh days to be there for her dogs dinner so she didn't have to stress about her. The list is long but this should give you a rough idea. I've never asked to be thanked and don't expect to be and I would do this for any of my friends.

Now its important to note that rm1 has invited me to a number of things with her friends over the last year we have lived together, but I've also made more of my own friends. This includes the neighbour (TN). TN moved in next door at the start of the year, I got along well with them and their partner, as well as the other roommates next door and we have done numerous things together (house parties, nights out etc.) and I would consider them friends. unsurprising considering we are similar ages with similar interests. Rm1 has been invited to most of these things however constantly turns them down as they aren't of interest to them. Despite this I have continued to invite them where I felt i could because TR has asked me to, and have encouraged TN to as well. She doesn't want to feel excluded (which is fine, minor thing happy to oblige where I feel I can).

So this weekend a friend I met through TN invited me to a house party. I said yes and TN, they're roommates and I coordinated to go together. They invited me over early for pre's and I was getting ready to go when rm1 came home from being out all day. She walks through the door looked exhausted and explains as much so i say early night then and continue getting ready. She asks where im going, when Im leaving etc. and I say in about 5 minutes, TN's roommate wants to do pres and wants my help getting ready (the theme is 2000s punk and I very much give lifestyle not a phase). She then asks if she can come, and I said yeah of course if you want (we're both friends with TN) and Ill message them to make sure its cool (because its not my house so Im going to be polite). Then she back peddles and decides she doesn't want to go. I push gently in encouragement because its been a while since she hung out with them and I know she's anxious about loosing friends from always turning down invites but she's firm and says no I want to go to bed so I say ok and leave.

Party goes well, fun night with new friends and many drinks. I get home at about 2 am and sleep so hard my face is numb the next morning. TN, TNs roommates and I had discussed going to the local cafe for hangover cure and coffee at about 10 the next day and TN messages in the group chat between our houses at about 10. I had just woken up so said let me get dressed and im in, RM1 also joins us for a break from study. Im not feeling great but im not dying. mild headache, bit spacey. nothing unusual for a hangover. We all eat and I get up to pay the bill, my shout because TN covered the uber home last night and TR had just handed in they're thesis so I thought Id do it as a lil treat. we head home and I veg on the coach watching tv all day just enjoying my day off while they study. Our other roommate who works nights awakens at about 4 and we're just chatting away. I mention in passing ""man I wish you were there last night, I feel like you and friend would get along so well"" to our other roommate (this is important). and she goes off to work.

The second she leaves rm1 turns on me and blows up. Im making her feel like crap because Im always complementing our other roommate, I never invite them to anything even though she asked me to and i've been treating her like shit for weeks.

Now im definitely the asshole here but I snapped. asked her if she was joking and got angry. I could see she was upset but after months of dealing with her shit and doing all of the above I was like are you for real rn. I have never had a friendship that was so emotionally draining and mentally demanding.

She tried to justify her upset about not being invited to the party by saying she always asks her friends if i can come and so now all i feel is like im some pitty case her friends don't actually like on top of being pissed off about her blowing up at me and saying im not being a good friend and before i could point out any of the reasons why i find that so aggravating she took off to her room in tears. I knew we wern't going to get anywhere so I made dinner and went and hung out in my room because i didn't want to make things bigger then they need to be and then left for work this morning.

She sent a message to see where we stood today and I basically said im hurt and angry rn and if she can't handle a tough conversation to come see me when she could because If Im not honest with her Ill just end up hating her and I would ideally like to avoid that but honestly the temptation to tell her to grow up and get over herself and that her emotional stability is not my responsibility is real.

So am I the asshole? or is she really just toxic like all my friends keep telling me?",1,1729483706.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/HcD8T7AdtN): **October 7, 2024**

I (28F) and my fiancé (29M) have been engaged for three months and dating for two and a half years. Everything was going great and we were very happy, but recently we started having some issues. We are not having a wedding ceremony, mainly because we want to start having children soon and don't want to spend that kind of money (both of our families live abroad so it would be very expensive to fly everyone out) and reserve it for our down payment on our house. We decided to buy a house together and after that get legally married and start our family once we get settled. This is where the issues came.

I come from a family of farmers (the fruits and vegetables kind not the animal type) from both sides of my family but my parents are not farmers. My dream has always been to have a farm, for personal use, not as a job but my fiancee doesn't want that and i accepted that. However, one thing that is non-negotiable for me are my chickens. I have 10 chickens and he knows that, so when house hunting i was looking for a house with a decent backyard to be able to raise them freely as they do in the house im renting for now.

He started getting distant and avoiding me after i told him i planned to bring my chickens to our new house but i didnt put two and two together until l asked him a week later. After a week of being avoided I decided to go to his house to talk things out this past Saturday. I asked him what was wrong with him he said that he thought i would get rid of my chickens before moving together and that's why he was putting up with it, but that he didn't want chickens in our house and that it was making him reconsider our relationship, because, his words, “he didn’t want someone who came with package” and then asked me to get rid of my chicken. 

This made me extremely angry and I admit that I lost it, I started hysterically crying and told him that my chicken were more important to me than our relationship (not true at all, I said this without thinking in a state of panic) so if he was not willing accept that my chicken are coming with me then we were done. I got in my car and went home, where I spent the whole day crying. He tried calling me, and I did not pick up because I didn’t want to say more things i didn’t mean, which I told him in a message.

On Sunday I was feeling better and decided to call him and we agreed to meet for coffee that same afternoon to talk about it. I started by apologising about what I told him, and I told him it was not how I felt at all, to which he told me that he knew I didn’t mean it and that he didn’t hold it against me. I decided to be honest with him and told him about the farm thing, how it was my life dream and that it affected me not being able to have this when we could well afford it (we are both engineers and have decent salaries) and he wouldn’t need to do anything on it. I was honest about how I was not aware of the impact this had had on me until he asked me to get rid of my chickens (which, as weird as it may sound, I love like my own children), ultimately asking me to get rid of the last piece of my childhood dream, and how that just set me off. He said I was being selfish and that he needed some time to think because he was not sure if this is how he wanted his life to be from now on, which I accepted (though, being honest, I don’t understand)

I talked to my best friend about this and she told me to just give up the farm thing, insinuating I was in the wrong, but, I assume, not wanting to directly tell me.

Me and my fiancee have not talked after that, and I’m giving him the space to think about our situation.

Am I really in the wrong here? I genuinely do not understand why this is such a big deal and I feel like he really must not love me as much as I thought he did if he doesn’t want my dreams to come true and it’s eating me alive. Any advice is appreciated, but please don’t be too harsh.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Was OOP planning to have the chicken inside the house**

> **OOP:** No I do not. I have them in my backyard. I was thinking about building a fence to keep them in a separate space since I understand that it might be uncomfortable for him if they can be around the whole backyard.

+

> We talked about this on Sunday. They wouldn’t come into the house and I told him he wouldn’t have to do anything for them and that they are my responsibility but he doesn’t agree.

+

> I don’t know if you have had chickens before, but they really do not require much. You can go on weekends trips easily and hire someone to feed them for longer trips. I don’t kill my chickens and I did tell him that they are my responsibility and mine alone so he would not have to do anything. They are not fed with his money,honestly I make slightly more than him and he has expensive hobbies too, but even if he didn’t money is not an issue. We agreed on a house outside the city bc we want to have a large family. I really don’t get why you would think I’m going to have him do everything when I have been taking care of them alone for years.

**Commenter 1:** Honestly, I m surprised you two didn’t discuss this earlier in your relationship. I myself being an urban person I can understand why your boyfriend maybe reluctant about raising chicken for starters I won’t want that responsibility further I m sort of nauseated with the whole idea of seeing my dinner roaming in my backyard - pooping, eating and more!

> **OOP:** Well I think it’s worth mentioning that we are both vegetarian. We did talk about pets and we agreed on dogs and cats. I assumed they were fine because honestly I talk about them more often than I should and he never said anything about it.

**Why did it take OOP so long to talk about living on a farm and such on**

> **OOP:** he knew that my dream was to have a farm before this. i agreed to not do the farm thing but i didn’t think my chickens were included here since they are my pets and i live with them. the getting rid of my chickens thing was just the last straw, since it’s the closest thing to what i actually wanted, and getting rid of that was just too much for me to handle.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/xdIBO65Vq0): **October 14, 2024**

Hello, i wanted to give an update to my post since a lot has happened in a week and honestly i need to get it off my chest. I also wanted to thank everyone for giving their thoughts on the situation and take the time to respond.

this is my og post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/Ss1wHtjfbM

Now onto the update.
I guess this does not come as a surprise to anyone, me included, but we broke up. There is A LOT more to the story than what i knew and honestly im still trying to process everything that has happened.

After almost a week of no contact, he called me on Friday and told me he wanted to talk to me as soon as possible so i told him to wait for me in my house and i would go there once i was done with work. I got home at 9pm and i found him drunk on my couch crying while hugging his dog, why was his dog in my house? i had no clue either. By the time i got home, he was way too drunk to have a conversation with me so i put him to sleep and decided we would talk the next day.

I woke up first so i started cleaning the kitchen (which he made a mess trying to find any alcohol) but at some point he came in, looked at me straight in the eyes and told me “i’m moving to New York, we are over,” before even saying good morning. After that he tried to leave but i grabbed him and asked him to explain himself. We talked, and he finally explained himself.

He told me how before everything happened, he thought about living in a farm and how the more he thought about it the more he liked it, and that he was thinking about suggesting it to me again (after he said that there was no way he could live that way and to just forget about it) . After that he told me everything that has been happening recently. 

Apparently, a day before he started ignoring me, his boss told him that there was a vacancy on a role he could take in the main office in New York (he was working on a branch in our city) and he asked for a day to think about it, but he really wanted to take it. He talked to his mom about it, and she told him that it was good and that we both could move to New York together and start there as a new family. 

After that, he decided to call MY best friend (idk why) and she told him that i would never approve of moving to New York and he shouldn’t even suggest it because i would get mad, that he should either move alone or reject the job, but not tell me (this makes me sound horrible, but i swear i can in fact communicate, i do not know why she says that). After that he called his mom AGAIN and told her that he was moving to New York alone and breaking off our engagement, and his mom told him that it was a horrible idea and that he should just reject the offer because he was getting old and needed to start a family soon. Mind you this man is pushing 30 and still doing everything his mom tells him, so of course he decided to do just that. The next day he rejected the offer, and that’s when he started ignoring me.

During the week he was ignoring me, he thought about everything and decided that the best idea was to make me sacrifice things too, until he didn’t feel bad about rejecting the job offer anymore (miserable but together basically? lmfao), so everything started with asking me to get rid of the chickens. He called me selfish because he gave up a lot for me but i wasn’t willing to give up my pets for him (mind u i did not know he had rejected the job offer), and he asked for time to think about our engagement because he didn’t feel better about anything after telling me to give up something, and he had to think about how far he should go to feel better about rejecting the job offer, or if he would feel better at all after i gave up almost everything for him(the audacity of this man LMFAO). So basically, the chickens were never an issue he was just trying to make me feel miserable because he was.

On Friday he came to the conclusion that he did not hold enough power over me to make me give up everything for him (finally) so he decided to just move to New York alone and break up with me. He contacted his boss to ask if the job offer was still valid, but after two weeks, it obviously wasn’t, but there was a lower position available (worse than his current job) and since he had already made up his mind he just took it. That’s when he called me and told me he needed to talk to me ASAP. He went home, picked up his dog (too big to bring to an apartment, so he’s just “getting rid of it” by giving it to me, said by him) and came to my house to drink everything i had in my home.

After telling me all of this he decided it was an amazing idea to ask for the ring back but after everything he said there’s no way i was not selling it and taking the money. That’s the situation we are in now, he left after that and, obviously left the dog in my house.

This weekend was hard It’s weird to go from engaged to single but it’s better to break it off now than when I’ve given up everything for him and we have children stuck in the middle of everything. I’m also trying to figure out whether my best friend is really my best friend or not (i did not go into detail but this bitch dragged me through the mud to my ex) but that’s another story.

I also contacted my boss today and asked if there was any possibility of working from home full time ( i currently wfh four days a week and go to the office on Friday) and it might be possible in a few months so im very excited to move further away from the city and getting my dream farm. Hopefully i find a farm man to build my dream farm and a big family with hahaha, but for now im focusing on myself and my chickens, and im going to buy a coop like those in movies with seats for each one of them that look like a little house because after all this i feel like i deserve it.

Anyways Im doing better than i expected and im loving having his St bernard in my house, it makes it feel a lot fuller and i love it.

I don’t know if anyone wanted an update but thats it, hope you enjoy. If anyone has any tips on how to get over all of this let me know hahaha.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP on the communication issues with her ex**

> **OOP:** Thank you. To be honest, we’ve always had issues with communication on his end and it was the cause to most if not all of our fights so that’s definitely a must for my next relationships haha.

**Commenter 1:** Why wouldn't he even suggest moving to NY together? This is extremely weird.

> **OOP:** Because my best friend told him not to, he really is that simple minded somehow.

**Commenter 2:** Please update us after your talk with the best friend because that came off as a bit suspicious to me. Maybe she will up and move to NY because she thinks he will like seeing a familiar face and fall madly in love! Or maybe she was just jealous of you and your relationship.

> **OOP:** I highly doubt she’s into him, I think the second is more likely. Anyway I’m honestly not in the right space for more confrontation so it’s something I’m putting off for now, but I will confront her eventually

**OOP on her ex’s dog adjusting to new surroundings**

> **OOP:** He’s doing great so far. It’s not the first time he’s staying in my house since I kept him when he went out for more than a day, which is often. I’m worried about when he realises that this is not temporary but nothing wrong so far, he has always liked me a lot.

After my wife and I make an iced coffee and the kids get ice for their water bottles for the school day, we never had enough by mid-day. 

We saw the Samsung model RF27CG5400SR counter depth fridge with dual ice makers and multiple types of ice and thought this was a perfect solution. We were assured by the Lowe's sales specialist that all manufacturers have the same kinds of issues with compressors, and no one manufacturer has more or less issues than another. 

The delivery arrived the next day and the installer said to run several gallons of water through the water line after he installed it. He didn't bother to remove the dozen strips of industrial tape that got stuck on shelving and on the ice makers, which I didn't realize until he left. After running the initial 3 gallons of water and connecting it to wifi with the Samsung mobile app, the water dispenser suddenly stopped working. 

I tried locking/unlocking the door dispenser from the control panel, but that had no effect. I called Samsung for support and they were of no help. They insisted I call the Lowe's store I bought it from for support. After calling the store, someone there redirected me to the Lowe's installer and distribution center phone line. Someone there assured me a manager would get back to me today, which they did not. 

Needless to say I'm disappointed by this product and the delivery/installation. I'm concerned about the faulty of this installation and refrigerator, as we recently had severe damage from a previous refrigerator line leak that cost us a significant water damage home owners insurance claim and plumbing work to improve the leaky plastic water line with a flex metal cable and water line connection box. 

I assume I'm going to hear something by tomorrow morning for the next steps to deal with this. I’ll likely be returning this and will need to re-evaluate my purchase decision for a replacement. I may prefer to go to the local smaller appliance retailer we've done business with before, as we found we got a better sales and delivery/installation service.

I may need to find a side-by-side model with an ice maker that isn't on the door or in a refrigerator compartment, as they tend to freeze up and fail.",1,1729483034.0,Appliances,0,1.0,False

My symptoms are:
Red patches on chest, both sides of my abdomen, stomach, hands, arms, back and face. 
Itchy scalp, forehead.
Hands feel swollen and almost like they're going to pop when I drop them down to my sides.
Feeling faint and tired.
Loss of appetite.

I didnt eat anything before it happened. I had a coffee from a gas station and nicotine pouch. So Is this an allergic reaction to something? An autoimmune disease?

I just had to change the SSR to the bigger relay as my old one burnt out. Common apparently.

Now I have a really weird issue where the machine is full of water. You turn it on then, the green and orange lights turn on and it heats up. Then after 15-20 minutes the orange light will turn off along with the PID display. Powering the machine down and on and again at this state does not resolve the issue and only the green light is on. Taking the water tank out and putting it back in also does not trigger the relay.

 If I leave it to cool for 5 minutes and then turn it off and on again. The orange light clicks on but will only stay on for 2 mins and then turn off again.

I have also played with the magnetic tank float switch and can audibly her the relay click when it's in its operational 15-20 minute window of working correctly. When it's in this hot broken state the relay does not click even if you hold the magnet directly to the sensor.

I have gone through numerous troubleshooting pages but nothing I have read pertains to this issue.

Has anyone had this before? Is something wrong with the main control unit?

I have to say nothing more frustrating than being denied coffee in the morning by a faulty machine!!

A new classmate of mine and I bonded on the first day of class (grad school) this past Fall. He (32M) and I (27F) hit it off right away because we had several things in common, including that I happened to know his sibling. I had a crush on him immediately, but of course wanted to determine if he was straight and single before I actually hit on him. Over the next month I would see him 3-4 times a week and we would have small conversations here and there, always joking and friendly. He never hit on me, but something about his eye contact and eagerness to talk made me think he liked me in some capacity. We had chemistry. I asked around, no one knew what his relationship status was. I invited him to a group event which I thought would be a good chance to have someone ask him, but he cancelled last minute to help his sibling. In order to invite him I got his number, and in texts and in person after he seemed genuinely interested in going to another thing like that. So invited him again and he accepted, but then cancelled again last minute for a family thing. At this point I thought he must not be interested, but he kept texting me so I decided to try to shoot my shot and asked him hang out with me and get coffee or a drink. He was down to get drinks and we made plans for happy hour the next week. 

At this point we're six weeks into knowing each other, and I still don't have his instagram so I asked for it. He said he got rid of it before school started. I couldn't find him myself when I tried. On the day of the happy hour ""hang"" he asked if I was still on and if we could change to coffee, so we did and walked to a place near campus. He was immediately warm, all smiles, responsive when I teased him and he teased me back. We talked for two straight hours, about growing up, personal interests, travel, family, his sibling's engagement and wedding preparation, where we were living right now and where we wanted to live in the future. At two hours it seemed like a good time to head out, so he walked me out and I saw bus had just left. He offered to drive me home, and we talked more about family and music on the way. We shared the same taste. As soon as he got home he texted me in a very warm, borderline flirty way that he had enjoyed spending time with me. The next morning I sent him the music I told him about and when the conversation progressed I hinted that I would invite him to something in the future as a plus one, and he loved the message and said he was happy to be in the running.

One hour after those texts, my roommate texts me having done DEEP internet scraping to find out he does have an instagram (though private so I couldn't tell if he was actively using it) and a threads account. His most recent post, from 2 weeks ago, is with his fiancee. Her most recent tagged post is together with him attending a wedding 1 week ago. I was shocked and cried. Everyone has told me it's good it didn't go any further. Some have made suggestions that I had just built up this crush in my head, as if it had all been one-sided, but the feeling in the pit of my stomach says otherwise. Also, as a woman, I had more than one friend actively discourage me from just straight up asking him out or asking if he was single because I would be giving up the game too soon.

Given the thing he said when I asked for his instagram and the length of our knowing each other without him bringing up his fiancee once, 3/3 my friends have told me this was an EA. Thank goodness my roommate discovered the truth in time, because people had been telling me he's probably just shy and I should keep pursuing him, and tbh I would have.

The question is, are we correct that this was an EA? I'm going to see him in class tomorrow and for the rest of the semester. What do I do?",1,1729481511.0,emotionalaffair,0,1.0,False

The options are almost overwhelming and I usually prefer a simple cup of coffee. Sometimes I'll order their iced caramel machiatto though. 

When I ordered, I panicked like I always do when placing someone else's drink order at Starbucks because I don't know all the different cheat codes. So I ordered an iced latte and then said with vanilla. 

My friend swears up and down that it tasted different because I ordered it with vanilla and not as an iced vanilla latte. Like... Isn't it the same all around? Milk, espresso and vanilla syrup? I don't understand how they could make it any different based on what I said. I know they have caramel syrup and caramel sauce but is there a magic vanilla sauce I don't know about or something?

I stopped fasting or intentionally trying to fast throughout my holiday.

Expected weight gain because I was eating 6-7 times a day. ( trying all tasty looking restaurants and food as you do)

Now that I'm back and stepped on the scale, I'm shocked to see I didn't gain as much as I expected. 

When before going to japan my SW: 110.3kg and after coming back from japan 115.3kg. 

5kg exact gain of weight. 

I was expecting 10kg or more tbh.

From my many months of fasting experience, I know 100% or nearly all of this is water weight. And I was proven right. 

As soon as I landed home, I started a fast. I was intending to go 66 hours but only made it 36 hours. 

I lost 2.7kg in a mere 36 hours... 

Went from 115.3kg to 112.6kg.

After a 3 hour refeed of japan matcha flavoured kitkat and 500g of beef mince, got back into a another fast. 

Woke up today and weighed myself again. (12 hours into fast) 

I'm now officially 111.9kg. Loss of 0.7kg. 

After finding out I've lost more than half of what I had gained, legit rewarded myself by breaking my fast with a coffee.

It do be like that sometimes. 


Anyway, just wanted to post this to motivate other fasters who are stressing when going on holidays to fast or not. Just enjoy your holiday and know a simple 36-48 hour fast will help ypu lost nearly 60% of weight gain.

Best way to get my attention is via a DM. I'm likely not gonna be checking replies/notifications on this post.

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

Lattafa Khamrah: Night time, dates with the missus and special occasions

Lattafa Maahir Legacy: Work, errands and gym

Arabiyat Prestige Nayel Queen: Lectures and casual hangouts

In terms of projection, I’m looking for something that has a good scent bubble/projection (when I’m taking orders or handing a coffee over I’d like people to get a nice whiff) and for performance, a solid 8hours or so is nice but I understand that that might be asking for a lot.

A woman sat across from me and suddenly asked, ‘Why are you sitting like that? Do you need to use the restroom?’ I have no idea why someone would ask a complete stranger that, so I fully ignored her. She asked two more times, and I still didn’t respond or even look at her. Then, she came up to me and started talking to my dog, saying, ‘Yeah, she’s lazy,’ referring to the fact that I was sitting on the grass. I asked her to leave us alone, and she eventually turned back to her side. I had no idea she would come back, but she did—and this time, she grabbed her coffee, which I hadn’t noticed before, and spilled it on me.

I did file a police report, and they classified it as harassment, but they won’t investigate further since I don’t have her details (she isn’t my neighbor or anything).

With that being said, have you seen this woman? If you have any information about her or where to find her, please let me know",32,1729480068.0,Upperwestside,9,0.91,False

I’d like to get some tips re. how you would invest if you were in my situation:

I’m 31, and currently own the following:

1. One apartment (Brussels), mortgage has been fully reimbursed already. Worth ~€210-220k. Currently renting it for 1050€. 
2. Saving account (Keytrade high fidelity): ~€75k
3. Pension fund (Argenta): €8.5k

I’m currently not working but planning to start working again in 6 months. My job allows me to save around €90k a year, and my goal is to work two (or three) more years to have enough money saved to do something I enjoy more without caring too much about how much money I make (so let’s assume I will have an extra €180k saved in two years). 

How would you invest that money if you were me (ETF, invest in a new apartment, etc)? FYI I’d like to keep around 70k to potentially open a small business (coffee shop). ",3,1729479990.0,BEFire,1,1.0,False

A big movie production comes and starts shooting where she lives and she meets a famous actor who is arrogant. He's playing the main character in an a christmas carol type movie (so scrooge. But I can't remember if they stayed completely true to the original) and they incorporate his role into real life. It's like a love story between him and the girl.

Now all of this I know 100% was in the book, this next part I'm pretty sure it was too but I could also be unknowingly mixing in details I read in a different book.

I believe her brother was in jail and her father owned a convenience store or her brother robbed a convenience store and that's why he's in jail. Her dad could have owned the diner or whatever she worked at. It's one of those. I think she danced when she was little and stars may have played a role in her life.

Hey there,

I intentionally made the title straightforward, I’m currently looking for a healthy companionship now because I’m not sure if I’m ready to be in a relationship as of now but I’m open to the idea of it. I have fairly decent life, work’s pretty decent, friends are great, I have healthy relationships with my family, but I just don’t have anyone to connect with on a deeper level. I’m looking for someone to unwind and let go of all the pressures of the world and be the real me with. 

I mean wouldn’t it be nice to be the real you with someone where you don’t feel judged or schooled or something. Someone to live in the moment with and just enjoy life and be happy? I want that. 

I wanna hangout with someone where we support eachother emotionally, be each other’s accountability partner, help eachother from drifting off from sanity haha. I am a very outgoing person, I explore the city on weekends, I’d wanna explore with someone like minded where we can truely compliment eachother with our aura. I wanna hold hands and go for long walks and do stupid things and make some memories. 

Maybe I’m just too lonely these days? I don’t know. 

I’m looking for someone, nice, someone who’s single and moved on from any previous relationships, someone who’s in the right headspace to invest their time and energy, and hopefully someone who’s lives in Bangalore. I don’t mind your past, your present or future I want this to be a non judgemental connection where we can truely be genuine. I hope you’re from the age group 24 - 30, if you want something more someday, something final.

So I’m a southie, little dusky guy with messy hair, and I’m rocking a well groomed beard. Just like every other human being I enjoy binging shows, listening to music, gaming, anime, and what not. Currently I’m an elden ring player, obsessed with it. I’m a huge fan of horror and fantasy genre. I enjoy rap music, be it English or punjabi, or even hanumankind. I love sci-fi, and thought provoking content, anything that makes my mind busy. I’m a huge coffee lover (but I don’t drink excessively). I’m into spirituality and mindfulness, this year I’ve taken that seriously and it has done wonders to my life, so it goes without saying it would be amazing if you’re into it too. As for my height I’m 186cm, so that would be 6ft and 1in I guess anyways. So let’s get to know eachother more as we interact so I’m stopping my self intro here. 

If you think what I’ve said here resonates with you then hit me up. I’m on the chat waiting for like minded souls hoping something great will happen this time.

He said he only has a quarter and he’s hungry so i said i get you something like a burger combo and this other lady heard me she must’ve been homeless too and asked for help. But as i was ordering this meal the cashier was extremely rude and annoyed now ( she wasn’t before ) the homeless man was right next to me i should add. 

Made me thinks maybe her POV that she had to work for everything in her life so she’s mad when shes sees a “handout” or shes just having a bad day. Idk im not her.

But this isn’t my only example. it happens over and over again.

Do people don’t care anymore or is this the society we live in.

It’s easier to be mean and it’s safer but it’s like you’re punished for doing good.  

Im tired of the idea that homeless people are subhuman

Where all just trying to enjoy life for the first time and some got it easier some had it worse. So why not help someone if you can unconditionally and not expect a “Thank you”.

Money is seriously the root of all evil.

Im curious what you think about this?

Do you think it has gone bad? To be fair, there is nothing weird about the smell and it doesn’t have molds or anything.

Also, the same goes for the budino but like the budino has this “alcoholic” taste aside from the tangy flavor.

There’s more to what led to the breakup than this, but it’s important to note that part of how my ex and I got together was through having similar Christian faith and worldview. I was a Christian for many years, but deconstructed to agnosticism about two years ago. My ex and I managed to stay together for a few more years despite that, however it (among other issues) eventually caught up to us. Ultimately, the relationship didn’t work out. Now, I am four months post-breakup and have started to dabble in dating apps a bit. It’s my first time in the dating realm as a non-Christian. So instead of trying to match with possible future pastors, or men with more fundamental values, I have now been matching with more progressive, agnostic/atheist men. 

Another important bit of context: when it comes to dating apps, I have a boundary where I do not typically give out my phone number to someone I match with until after I’ve met them in person over something simple, like coffee or lunch. If we hit it off, I give them my phone number in the chat after  I get home, and then we plan a more “proper” date. Not that coffee or lunch isn’t a date necessarily, but it’s a bit more on the casual friend side in these situations

Three days ago, I matched with a man (we’ll call him Michael, 42m). Michael’s dating profile made it clear that he was agnostic and progressive just like I was. We matched on the app and started chatting. He seemed intelligent and well spoken. He was very passionate about social issues, which I really appreciated. We also had a lot of other things in common outside of our religious and political stances, such as similar hobbies. We were having really good conversation and hitting it off.  

The conversation between Michael and I started to take a bit more of a spicy/flirty turn when we started joking about having sex in a church for fun. I’ll admit, I was a little bit turned on by it. So even though it went against my initial boundary (which he was aware of), I said, “I’m not usually this forward, but do you want my number?” He said yes, but only if I was comfortable. I assured him I was and gave him my number. I think the spicy church sex conversation mixed with us hitting it off in general just sort of pushed me over the edge. We then switched to texting, and over the next couple of days, he would casually bring up the fantasy and I would just flirt back, but also try to simmer it down a bit since we were still getting to know each other and hadn’t met yet.

Just a couple of hours ago, he texted “Can I ask what made you feel comfortable enough to give me your number?🙂”. I was a little taken aback by the question, but I was honest with him, and told him that I enjoyed talking to him, and the church sex fantasy sort of pushed me over the edge. He was silent for a while, and then replied “Oh” I said “haha yeah, I’ll admit it was kind of hot.” He just said “It was.” I sent a smiley face, and he replied with just a thumbs up. I felt like something was off. So I apologized if I had somehow offended him, but then he said “I'm not sure what I'm feeling right now. A bit hurt and confused but I do like you. I thought I had simply made that much of an impression that you wanted to talk off the app. Especially since you said that it was out of character for you to be that forward.” I tried to assure him that he wasn’t wrong about that, and that maybe the fantasy was sort of the cherry on top of a sundae. Or rather just what pushed me over the edge. He then responded “Par for the course, I suppose.” He had mentioned early on in the conversation that the reason he was single at 42 was because women were either not as interested in him as he was, or vice versa. His use of this phrase rubbed me the wrong way, because it was as if he was assuming that I was only interested in the fantasy. Nevertheless, I apologized again and just said “it was nice talking to you. I hope you have a good week.” He responded back with “Take care.” I assume I won’t be hearing from him again. 

I was just talking with a couple of friends about this, one thinks that there was nothing wrong with my answer and that Michael was just overthinking it. The other thought I was the asshole because they could see where it sounded like I was only interested in the fantasy rather than him. So I thought I would bring it here. AITAH for telling a guy I matched with that I gave him my number mostly because I was turned on by a fantasy that we created together, but at the same time was starting to like him?

I put the dark walnut stain on about 10 years ago with a friends help- they had all the equipment and knowledge so I’m starting from scratch with noob level knowledge. 

I read that you’re not supposed to go up more than 40 ish in grit strength. That being said, I started sanding at 80, and the google directions I found said to sand again at 180 and 220 before staining. The sheets I bought don’t have 180, they go from 80 to 120 to 150 to 220. Can I replace the 180 with 150, or is that 180 really important?

Like so many, I'm convinced it has some connection to my gut health even though cardiologist and gastroenterologist both said no, and that everything seems fine.  
 Anyways, I've been meeting with success over the past while (after 10 months of these PVC episodes) so I thought I would share my strategy:
- stopped any obvious triggers (coffee, alcohol)
- started logging everything I was eating. I mean everything!
- logging any burping / bloating / heartburn and of course PVCs. Part of the log was documenting the severity of the PVCs
-  strict about regular exercise (5x a week)
- and gross as it sounds, also started logging bowel movements

A few patterns emerged:
- I found new potential food triggers as well as saw that it's not always about the last thing that I ate.
- The simple act of logging / labelling the severity of the episodes felt like I was actually doing something, which helped with feeling of helplessness.
- I've always had questionable gut health, but documenting everything showed that constipation is a HUGE trigger.  Small changes to my diet just for this has been the biggest improvement yet. 
- seeing the connection between my gut health and the PVCs (as well as the exercise), makes me feel better about my heart health, which in turn lowers the anxiety around the episodes/flare-ups when the do happen. They feel bad, they are inconvenient, but they are NOT killing me.

6 days out of the past month I've had episodes, but just 3 months ago that number would have been more like 26. 

Anyways, I hope this helps and thanks to so many of you for sharing your stories.",8,1729478782.0,PVCs,1,1.0,False

We have a 6 month old Dalmatian shepherd mix (mine and GF dog, got him at 4 months old), been crate training and structured walks daily. We also have a 4 year old dachshund (originally GFs dog before moving in) who will try to kill anyone that walks by the house. She has great manners with guests but anyone outside the fence in front of our house is a target. He has no issue with crate training and will go right in on command and sleep. 

Our 6 month old was doing very well with exposure training for the first two months we had him. Trips to Home Depot, coffee shops, restaurants. He’d show great manners and body language in public with people and other dogs. 

Around the house he has picked up the dachshunds behaviors of barking at passersby/ running to the front fence (5 ft vinyl fence). In public and on walks he’s started to bark at any dog in sight (we keep distance) and has had a few melt downs. 

We’re going to a trainer in a few weeks but I’d like to see what’s worked for others in a similar multi dog household. 

Note* We’ve spent a lot of time before getting this puppy trying to train these behaviors out of the dachshund and got nowhere, another trainer told us “good luck trying to train it out of a dachshund”. ",1,1729477889.0,puppy101,1,1.0,False

[Verse 1]

Pullin’ off the highway, got a long road ahead,


Dusty old sign, yeah, it’s time to rest my head.


Neon lights flicker, like a beacon in the night,


Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, everything feels just right.

[Chorus]

Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, where the stories never end,

Road-weary travelers, find a place to mend.

Laughs and late-night tales, over beers and gin,

At Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, let the good times begin.

[Verse 2]

Rooms are kinda quirky, but the vibe is always warm,

Grumpy old cat lounges, keeps the place from harm.

Motel coffee brewin’, gotta grab a cup or two,

Chatting with the locals, they’re as wild as they’re true.

[Chorus]

Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, where the stories never end,

Road-weary travelers, find a place to mend.

Laughs and late-night tales, over beers and gin,

At Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, let the good times begin.

[Bridge]

Underneath the stars, by the fire’s glow,

Tales of love and laughter, the miles come and go.

With every friendly face, I feel right at home,

In this quirky little spot, I never feel alone.


[Chorus]

Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, where the stories never end,

Road-weary travelers, find a place to mend.

Laughs and late-night tales, over beers and gin,

At Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, let the good times begin.

[Outro]

So if you’re out there drivin’, needing to unwind,

Stop at Big Dick’s Halfway Inn, leave your worries behind.

Every road leads somewhere, but this one feels like kin,

You’ll find a little magic at Big Dick’s Halfway Inn.",0,1729477066.0,SunoAI,0,0.4,False
