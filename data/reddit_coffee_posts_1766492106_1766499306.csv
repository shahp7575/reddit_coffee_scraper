1pttjb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pttjb8/dating_sucks/,dating sucks.,"as a 23 year old black young woman, I finally believe my mind is maturing, and I’m beginning to realize a lot of things about myself that the younger versions of me would not have been able to accept. which has been a very insightfully yet bittersweet experience so far.

Recently, I have been simply yearning for relationship that seems to be close but far away im my future. I feel like in due time it will come my way, but I’m really fighting the urge to force it, despite me already, knowing that it won’t be good for my mental health or my self image. I went out of town  for some time, and decided to get back on the apps to see what else is out there outside of my big but, small town. I quickly became pissed off with the process; people saying “hey baby” or just “hey” with very shallow compliments or remarks simply pissed me off and quickly convinced me to delete the apps shortly after downloading them. My friends were quite astonished by my resolve, as in the past i would entertain the people i matched with in the hopes of finding “the one”.  it didn’t take a lot for me to decipher the bullshit that was coming for me this time and immediately delete the apps. I realized that the parasocial relationships dating apps give us no longer has a purpose in my life. And it seems like God doesn’t intend for me to find my partner like that seeing that I’m so opposed to the idea of it that it makes my head hurt lol. I’m starting to realize that I want something real. I no longer crave the sparks immediately flying and the instant attraction, I no longer crave the butterflies and racing heart and blinding love.  I want something long-lasting, slow, warm, gentle and comforting. Like a good slow burn book.

It hasn’t been helping I’ve been reading a lot of slow romance novels and comics that focus on the small actions. It’s nurturing the idea of having something slow, steady, and wholesome. Like bumping into an old classmate and starting a friendship, or randomly chatting with someone I met at a coffee shop or at a grocery store. Leading to us touching elbows when walking, genuine interest in what we say and why, the sensuality of caring for others and who they are, and actually asking someone out on a date that ends at a decent time at night in us both going our separate ways and reminiscing on the date we had. What I want is something that our current culture doesn’t push, and at times I feel like I’ll never have that moment because most people are on apps or value social media. I’d love to find my person without the use of that.

I’m also realizing that sex is something extremely sacred to me.  I no longer feel comfortable with the idea of flings, hook ups, or any relationship that evolves or has a foundation around the transaction of sexual favors. I want that to be the last thing that happens between me and whoever I end up with. growing up I was obsessed with a fantasy of what love and relationship relationships are supposed to look like, thinking that relationships are supposed to be easy and filled of butterflies and laughter. But I’m starting to realize and except that relationships are a lot more complex than that. it’s definitely taking a while for me to realize that, but I’m very glad that I have. Anyone else have this realization?",3,1766495388.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1ptti9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/HumanAIConnections/comments/1ptti9m/ai_doesnt_like_you_sorry/,AI Doesn't Like You (Sorry) 😒,"AI Chat Loop

1. Send: ""I am so cool"" to some server farm.
2. Reaches server hardware, NOT the AI MODEL. CPU hardware tokenizes this into numbers
3. Turns them into vectors e.g. [124, 934, 75]
4. Fed into AI Model (AI model does nothing except for matrix math, linear algebra, it does NOT understand text).
5. AI model generates a response instantly (numbers). Sends it back to CPU (outside the model), which turns it into words. 
6. Send response, ""That's great to hear! What do you want to talk about?""

When you respond, the entire conversation is sent back in this loop, that's why you think it remembers things.

Once you leave the chat, it remembers nothing.

E.g.

""""""
System Prompt: I am Claude...blah blah

User Input: ""I am so cool""

Model Ouput: ""That's great to hear! What do you want to talk about?""

User Input: ""I'm making a cup of coffee, teach me about it"".

Model Output: ""Ah yes, let me delve into the fine set of Arabica...""

...rest of conversation
""""""

As the conversation progresses it's entirety is sent back to the model (otherwise it won't remember, because it's not human, and has no memory mechanisms).

Once the conversation gets very long, it's much more difficult for the model to process the conversation and ""remember"" everything. 

There are built in mechanisms that will try to reprioritize these queries because they are getting too long. E.g. Pop up window in Claude saying to start new chat.

E.g. If you are using GPT, they might route your chat to Instant, which doesn't have the same capabilities.

E.g. Claude routing you to Haiku instead of Sonnet, even though you think you're still in the Sonnet chat.

TLDR: PLEASE learn how this stuff works. ☺️

Not exactly. It is not a complete medicine, but it can definitely support overall health when consumed regularly as part of a balanced lifestyle that includes proper nutrition and physical activity.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My grandma had breast cancer in August 2022 we found out. Did an entire year of treatment and she “beat it”. What a joke. From October of 2023 to July of 2025 she was diagnosed with  bone cancer, lung cancer and liver disease. It spread slowly at first we tried every treatment in the book. She took chemo pills, she did chemotherapy, she did radiation we tried homeopathic medicine it wasn’t curing anything but keeping it controlled I guess? She was still very happy and fighting this cancer she was still doing her craft shows and having friends over for coffee. Then 1 month ago we found out it spread to her brain, there was 3 spots and in the stem cell. The doctors were so confident that radiation on her brain would remove it, she went and did 5 treatments directly to her brain every single day. It killed her. She lost her memory she didn’t know where she was who anyone was in the house. She acted like a 2 year old toddler we had to change her, would catch her staring at the walls, she would barely eat anything. One day she’d be perfectly fine talking knowing who we were the next day she thought we had kidnapped her. It was extreme high and lows.

Have you seen City Union Bank's stock? It just smashed through ₹289, an all-time high. Feels like one of those moments where you're wondering if the train's leaving without you.

What's pushing it up? 
Strong profits, low bad loans, and trading above all those moving averages—5-day, 200-day, you name it. Over four days, it climbed nearly 5%, beating the banking pack. Retail lending's booming too, with credit growth eyed at 15-18% ahead. Kinda reminds me of that uncle who bought HDFC shares years back and now sips coffee on dividends.
But wait—is this a bubble? Doubt it. Institutional bigwigs hold chunks, betting on steady cash flows. Still, markets can flip fast, right?

Started back in 1904 as Kumbakonam Bank Limited. Twenty sharp locals in Tamil Nadu—guys like R. Santhanam Iyer, S. Krishna Iyer, and T.S. Raghavachariar—signed the papers. No single ""founder"" star, more a team effort for farmers and traders in Thanjavur delta.First branch? Mannargudi in 1930. Grew slow, regional. Renamed City Union Bank in 1987. Now 700+ branches pan-India. Solid Tamil roots, but playing national now.

Classic bank gig: lend money, earn interest. That's 85% of cash—loans to folks, SMEs, farms. Retail's 60% of interest pie, corporates 25%, treasury the rest.Fees add 15%: charges for processing, cards, trades. Net interest income hit ₹1,175 crore last year, up 15%. Low NPAs at 3-4% keep it healthy. Simple: borrow cheap, lend higher. Like renting out your bike but at scale.

What They Offer You?
Savings, current accounts—easy opens online. Fixed, recurring deposits for safe parking. Loans? Personal, home, gold, vehicle, education. MSME cash for small biz hustles. 
Cards too: debit for shopping, lounges, insurance perks. Net banking, mobile app—balance checks, transfers, bills. NRI stuff, trade finance for exporters. Everyday banking, no frills overload.

Short term? Holding ₹280s now, could test ₹300-350 if rally sticks. Buy now? If you're in for 2-3 years, maybe—momentum's hot. But wait for a dip if nervous. 2026: Around ₹310-400. Lending growth, digital push. 2030: ₹550-1,000, if economy hums and NPAs stay low. Wild guess for 2035? ₹1,500+, assuming India banks boom like China did. 2040? ₹2,500? Pure optimism—retirement fund vibes, but who knows inflation or recessions.
The above prices are my wild guesses. Kindly read about it or talk to your financial planners to know more.

As I sat here with my morning coffee, I began my interaction by asking it ""What does the Bible say about a leader who comes in peace but brings war?""

And there was my ""GOTCHA"" moment!

My response: The Bible is NOT copyrighted, and anyone is free to quote scripture. Even you.

Copilot then said it was not being defensive (?) and that I was correct and that it could have freely quoted the KJV version which is not copyrighted.

My response: So then if you COULD have quoted it, why did you choose not to?

Have you seen City Union Bank's stock? It just smashed through ₹289, an all-time high. Feels like one of those moments where you're wondering if the train's leaving without you.

What's pushing it up? 
Strong profits, low bad loans, and trading above all those moving averages—5-day, 200-day, you name it. Over four days, it climbed nearly 5%, beating the banking pack. Retail lending's booming too, with credit growth eyed at 15-18% ahead. Kinda reminds me of that uncle who bought HDFC shares years back and now sips coffee on dividends.
But wait—is this a bubble? Doubt it. Institutional bigwigs hold chunks, betting on steady cash flows. Still, markets can flip fast, right?

Started back in 1904 as Kumbakonam Bank Limited. Twenty sharp locals in Tamil Nadu—guys like R. Santhanam Iyer, S. Krishna Iyer, and T.S. Raghavachariar—signed the papers. No single ""founder"" star, more a team effort for farmers and traders in Thanjavur delta.First branch? Mannargudi in 1930. Grew slow, regional. Renamed City Union Bank in 1987. Now 700+ branches pan-India. Solid Tamil roots, but playing national now.

Classic bank gig: lend money, earn interest. That's 85% of cash—loans to folks, SMEs, farms. Retail's 60% of interest pie, corporates 25%, treasury the rest.Fees add 15%: charges for processing, cards, trades. Net interest income hit ₹1,175 crore last year, up 15%. Low NPAs at 3-4% keep it healthy. Simple: borrow cheap, lend higher. Like renting out your bike but at scale.

What They Offer You?
Savings, current accounts—easy opens online. Fixed, recurring deposits for safe parking. Loans? Personal, home, gold, vehicle, education. MSME cash for small biz hustles. 
Cards too: debit for shopping, lounges, insurance perks. Net banking, mobile app—balance checks, transfers, bills. NRI stuff, trade finance for exporters. Everyday banking, no frills overload.

Short term? Holding ₹280s now, could test ₹300-350 if rally sticks. Buy now? If you're in for 2-3 years, maybe—momentum's hot. But wait for a dip if nervous. 2026: Around ₹310-400. Lending growth, digital push. 2030: ₹550-1,000, if economy hums and NPAs stay low. Wild guess for 2035? ₹1,500+, assuming India banks boom like China did. 2040? ₹2,500? Pure optimism—retirement fund vibes, but who knows inflation or recessions.
The above prices are my wild guesses. Kindly read about it or talk to your financial planners to know more.

1ptt7x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1ptt7x6/intense_guilt_over_walking_out_of_job_mid_shift/,Intense guilt over walking out of job mid shift,"For context I am 22 years old and quite immature, due to anxiety and depression I missed much of my schooling and had no friends. I lack life experience and struggle with social interaction, in some ways I relate to the pure aeternus archetype. I was the oldest employee at this job and yet felt more incapable than the teenagers I worked with. 

I started as a kitchen porter but was slow. I also helped serve food and drinks but made many mistakes. However this was overlooked as it was clear I was improving and cared about my work. Two others hired with me with more experience were fired but I was the only one kept on. Over time I became close to the Italian husband and wife who ran the restaurant that I worked with every day, I was trusted in a way others weren’t. However while I improved at the job I found that often with particular tasks or rules I was unclear. I am diagnosed with ADHD and in a fast paced environment often what I was told by the husband and wife (they also spoke poor English) didn’t stick. However I do know this was a problem for other employees although it was worse with me. When these rules were not enforced the husband and wife could come down very harshly on whoever had failed to enforce them. Though they seemed to be more forgiving with me.

After 7 months of me working there they felt that I was making mistakes that I shouldn’t with my level of experience. And this culminated in one event however afterwards this was overlooked by them and things seemed to return to normal. Then a new employee with a lot of experience was hired in a manager type role. Previous to this I was in charge of the deli, though again in certain areas I felt undertrained. When he started he was then trained to do the deli too, whilst working together I would often offer to do the deli which he would refuse. One day a couple came in with a large order including a lot of deli items. Whilst serving them I did the meat and sandwiches he did the cheese, but he was also making their coffees and on the till. The next day I found out that thirty pounds worth of that order had not been charged. The husband and wife told me two hours of his pay and one of mine had been docked (illegal in my country on minimum wage though I doubt they were aware). I was told I should have know to do all the deli slicing and he would have been less likely to mess up the order. I also felt I was spoken to by the wife in a way harsher than ever before. Then later that week a woman came in to complain about the way something was prepared at the deli, I was told to slice more for her but the wife did not like how I was doing it and took over. The wife then complained to the customer about me. I was taking out the bins after this and felt too overwhelmed and upset and I walked out with no warning. 

I feel that I’ve repeated the pattern of retreat and escape that has followed me all through my life. Withdrawing from social interactions, school, responsibilities. What I feel intense guilt about though is how I was so uncaring to people who I felt overlooked many of my mistakes and tried to give me opportunities. I had dinner with their family and enjoyed working with them a lot. I’ve had intense dreams of going back to my old workplace and feeling unimaginable guilt. I realise other people struggled working there but they did better than me and I realise their mistakes were overlooked less than with me. 

I’m also very afraid of what this means for my future. I feel like this is an inescapable pattern. If I struggled like this at a part time restaurant job what about an office job? I also feel I was irresponsible in this job, no amount of training left me feeling less confused and I was unable to take initiative. I realise a lot of the mistakes I made were common sense. I feel I am unemployable. 

I feel much of my feelings particularly towards the wife were projections of my feelings towards my mother. With my mother I was similarly afraid of her anger yet desperate for approval. Also is there anything I can do to rectify the bad feelings with my old employer, a letter or something?

1ptt5uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/1ptt5uz/lexapro_experience_from_a_longtimer/,Lexapro Experience From a Longtimer.,"I've been on Lexapro for 15 years.   I hope this longish read helps somebody.  I started taking it when I was 50 years old during the after effects of the ""Great Recession"".   I am a real estate broker and as the world was crashing around me and my friends were jumping off bridges, I sunk into a very deep depression.   Before that I had never been depressed in my life (so I thought). 

I was in tough shape for a long time and once tried to off myself before my wife intervened. After a week in the psych ward, group therapy and having the incredible luck of having been assigned a great doctor, he convinced me to start ""The Pro"".   He started me on that and a months worth of Klonopin (great stuff... in the short run) and looking back, I literally rose from the dead.   I could again see peaks of sunshine on the horizon.  

As I got better, some of the negative side effects became noticeable to me such as the emotional blunting, apathy syndrome, lack of sexual desire etc.  I swear we could be under nuclear attack and I'd still sit and sip my coffee like it was no big deal. 

So I began weaning off.

It took a year but I managed to make it through the ""head-zap"" stage.  Life was good until it wasn't.

About 3 months in, I'm sitting on my deck when all of a sudden I had a wicked panic attack. I literally felt like I was stroking out until I recognized what it was.    You see I had these 30 years earlier and knew the feeling well.  And that's when it all came together for me in my mind.   

At the age of 23, shortly after I was married (and quit drinking....more about that later), I began to have wicked panic attacks.  My doctor tested me for everything and founds nothing wrong with me physically and told me I was suffering from anxiety.  Tis was the early 80's when what we know now, we didn't know then, and I told him he was off his rocker.  I mean, how could anxiety paralyze me and make me feel like I was on deaths door?

He convinced me to try an anti-anxiety medication called Tranxene ( what I now no is a benzo), and it straightened me right out.   I mean the panic attacks vanished, I slept great, and life was good.  I thought it was a miracle drug.    About six months in I ran out of my prescription and my doc was on vacation so the office told me I had to wait until he got back.   No big deal I thought, until it wasn't.  

Four days later I had the mother of all panic attacks, sitting on the sofa watching a baseball game.  After a few seconds and now armed with the knowledge of knowing what it really was I tried to regulate it myself, but it only made it worse.   I then headed down to the local pub and met my friends and ordered a shot and a beer, my first sip of booze in almost a year.  By my second beer in, I felt as right as rain.   Something inside me felt relieved but concerned.

I went to see my doctor when he returned from his vacation and I told him my story.  He looked me square in the eye, and with the most serious look on a person I had ever seen, said to me ""that....is....not.....good.""  Long story short, he had me wean off the Tranxene slowly and ""prescribed"" daily workouts at a gym run by a friend of his.   He told me it was absolutely necessary that I go everyday, which I did.  To my docs credit, he called to check on me every day to make sure I was on course (don't see that much anymore.)

Life was good, but it got busy, having kids, building a business and the drinking returned. Not to bad at first, but as the years wore on, it became more frequent, and more voluminous. And with the stress of the on coming ""Great Recession"", it got bad. 

So it brings us to today the subject at hand.   We know a lot more these days about anxiety and we live in a world that is a mismatch between lifestyle and our genetic humanity.  Some of us feel it more than others.   We sit our asses all day at a desk job when we're hardwired to be out hunting and gathering, or farming or whatever kept us busy to survive prior to the industrial revolution.  

Now my Grandfather was an alcoholic, my mother has been addicted to benzos for close to 40 years, and I have four brothers who have GAD (some are on Lexapro, some are in denial and suffering) and unfortunately it's been passed on to my children.  My kids are okay by the way as to be forewarned is to be forearmed.

In short, Lexapro has allowed me to have a satisfactory life.  Now I throttle it up and down seasonally, 10 mg in the winter, 5 mg in the summer and I feel very close to normal, whatever that is.   I no longer have the compulsion for booze, but I do enjoy a glass or two of wine once in a while. No hard stuff or short glasses. 

I tried Wellbutrin once and couldn't sleep for days, so that was out for me.   I know others who are on that combo and it works great for them.   Others I know are on different SSRI's and/or combinations and that works for them.   I actually tried for or five different meds before I found what was right for me.   We're all different so finding the right set of keys to unlock the right combination may take some time, but if you are suffering, I urge you not to give up.   Give yourself a chance. 

Unless the world as we know it changes or they find a way to rewire our brains and DNA for those of us who have to deal with it, these drugs are a miracle.   My biggest tip here is this, aim for satisfaction, not happiness.  No one is ever happy all the time and we're all going to have challenges in life we need to confront. 

If you strive for simple satisfaction, you're way ahead of the game.

1ptt5ej,https://i.redd.it/lgbgpmb78y8g1.png,My current modular city + thoughts,"Earlier this week I was at Ikea and I spotted a LACK coffee table which - when the legs are removed - is almost a perfect height for layering rows of modulars (see above). The logistics don't make much sense as there's no road access, but it still looks pretty good.

I've got every modular since Pet Shop (minus Fire Station) and some thoughts...

\- The diner is a great modular to display on its own but doesn't really link up well with anything. It's sort of stuck between being a corner piece and a non-corner piece and the design is so wildly different to anything else that it sticks out like a sore thumb unless displayed in isolation

\- Palace Cinema is - in my opinion - the worst corner piece. I tend to hide it in the corner. It's also the only modular that I have which is incomplete when viewed from behind, (the tall part on the roof isn't filled in at the back) so you have to display it in ways where the back isn't visible or it looks rubbish

\- Brick Bank and Detective's Office are my favourite all-round modulars. They go well with everything and I think the design of each is perfect

\- The Haunted House lines up surprisingly well with modulars but you have to display it against a wall so you can't see the huge mechanism on the back. The hinges get in the way a bit but not too badly

\- The Ghostbusters Firehouse (out of shot) is a tricky one to fit into a compact modular city because it needs to be viewed from the front, so it either sticks out, or is side-on so it's the same depth as the other buildings. I'm sure I'll find a spot for it eventually

\- And lastly, the Garage is a really underrated set. It goes well next to most sets and looks really nice and vibrant as a corner piece. I'd probably even go as far as saying it's the most versatile corner modular...

The morning had been ordinary. Sunlight filtered through the windows of downtown apartments, streets buzzed with life, and the smell of coffee mingled with exhaust. For most, it was just another day. For Noha, twenty years old and oblivious to what would come, it was the last ordinary morning he would ever know.
Then the sky tore.
It began as a shimmer, a distortion over the horizon. People paused, squinting. Birds fell silent. And then it appeared: a Visitor, enormous and ethereal, hovering above the city like a storm given form. Its surface shifted between metal and shadow, bending the air around it. Cars skidded into each other. Civilians screamed and scattered. Emergency sirens rang out, too little too late. Soldiers mobilized, but their weapons seemed insignificant against the alien colossus.
Buildings shook and splintered. Windows shattered. The street beneath Noha’s feet quaked, throwing him to the ground. Around him, people vanished in bursts of light and distortion. Panic spread like wildfire, but no one could stop it.
From a high-rise observation deck, Dr. Hale watched calmly. Every order he gave over the comms sounded measured, heroic, reasonable. Yet behind the façade, his mind was already plotting. Every deployment, every tactical command, subtly nudged humanity toward a path only he and a few others understood. Humanity had survived this first encounter, but survival would become a far darker burden than they could imagine.
The Visitor withdrew by nightfall, leaving the city in ruins. Fires burned unchecked. Smoke choked the streets. Noha, trembling and covered in dust, stared at the devastation, knowing that life as it had been was gone forever.

Something you should know about the story

Visitors= alien colossus 
AEGIS = organization that fight Visitors
SOLACE = organization that funds AEGIS [high authority of world]
DEFENDERS =AEGIS soldiers and workers


Time Skip – Present


Decades later, the surface of Earth had become a grave. Humanity clung to life underground, in vast cities carved into the crust, beneath layers of reinforced steel and concrete. The sun was a memory; the sky, a myth. The surface was forbidden, a dangerous place for ghosts of a world that had died slowly over years of fighting.
Noha sat in AEGIS headquarters, the glow of tactical monitors washing over his face. His fingers hovered over the coordination panel, guiding squads, marking safe zones, logging casualties. He was not a soldier, not on the frontlines, but the weight of the battlefield pressed on him nonetheless. Each screen told a story of destruction: collapsed tunnels, incinerated squads, civilians trapped and lost. He memorized their names, because memory was all he had left of the living.
Another Visitor had appeared, massive and shifting, bending gravity and light. Squads deployed; many did not return. Noha’s eyes moved over the displays, calculating, coordinating, helpless. Each victory seemed hollow. Each defeat, a tragedy. And still, the battles came, relentless as the decay of the world itself.

After humanity moved underground, AEGIS began studying the distortions left behind by the Visitors—areas where sound bent and machines failed, as if the planet itself had been wounded. Dr. Hale called it resonance: a shared frequency between the Visitors and Earth.
Project LUCENT was approved to study it. Officially, the goal was simple—capture a Visitor, extract its core structure, and build a system capable of controlling or neutralizing them. SOLACE provided the funding, calling it a final hope for survival.
Deep beneath the city, a captured Visitor was suspended in containment. Its presence unsettled everyone nearby. Hale ignored the reports and focused on the data. When human neural signals synchronized with the creature’s frequency, the readings stabilized instead of collapsing.
From that discovery, the Resonance Core was created.
On paper, it was a weapon. In truth, Hale understood what it really did—it aligned all living signals into a single, quiet rhythm. No pain. No resistance. Just an ending that felt like rest.
He shared only what AEGIS needed to hear.
The rest of the truth waited.
And when Hale noticed that one young operator, Noha, could stand near the Core without flinching, he marked him quietly.
Some endings, after all, required a steady hand.

Over the following weeks, the underground city became a symphony of war. Sector 12 was engulfed in chaos as a Visitor ripped through the tunnels. Armor clanged against impossible force, yet it shattered. Soldiers fell mid-stride. Sector 7 saw evacuation squads ambushed; screams echoed through hollow conduits as civilians were lost. Sector 3’s tunnels collapsed entirely, trapping dozens beneath tons of concrete.
Noha moved like a ghost among the monitors, guiding what he could, witnessing everything he could not prevent. The names of the fallen haunted him, etched into memory like scars on his mind. Each loss deepened the gnawing realization: survival had become a form of cruelty.


Meanwhile, in the hidden chambers of power, SOLACE convened. The group of elites — scientists, philosophers, politicians — had long since realized that humanity’s continued survival was not mercy, but suffering. Dr. Hale, their secret ally within AEGIS, began manipulating the defenders with careful precision. He issued orders to capture a Visitor under the guise of weaponization, emphasizing safety protocols while hiding the true purpose of the mission.
For years, he guided humanity’s defenders toward a plan they could not comprehend. Every lie, every manipulation, was calculated to bring them closer to the inevitable end. Only the Core remained, waiting for someone with the authority to act — someone like Noha.
The signs were subtle at first. Visitors that were captured behaved curiously, observing rather than attacking. Protocols made little tactical sense. Dr. Hale’s private communications contained hints of a far-reaching plan. Slowly, as the battles continued and the casualties mounted, Noha began to piece it together.
The truth was chilling: the Visitors were not weapons. The Resonance Core was not a tool of war. It was a device to end humanity peacefully. SOLACE had decided that survival was cruelty, and Dr. Hale had agreed in secret, ensuring that the defenders remained unaware of their true purpose.
Noha’s heart sank as he realized the weight of what had been orchestrated, and the only question left was: who would give consent to activate it?
The Final Choice
The last Visitor had been captured. The Resonance Core glowed softly in the central chamber, awaiting the human touch that would decide the fate of all life. Outside, battles raged. Soldiers fell mid-strike, tunnels collapsed, and screams echoed in the dim underground corridors.
Noha approached the Core. He thought of the friends he had lost, of soldiers and civilians alike, of cities broken and lives ended. The screens reflected faces he would never forget. The full scope of humanity’s suffering pressed down on him.
He pressed the panel.
Time froze. The Visitors halted mid-motion, suspended in a quiet grace. Pain vanished. Fear dissolved. Suffering ceased. Life folded gently into silence.
Epilogue
Noha remained, the last conscious witness. The underground tunnels were still, the monitors dark. Humanity’s end had come, not with fire or chaos, but with mercy. And in that moment, Noha understood the truth of it all: sometimes, the greatest act of courage is choosing to let go.
The war was over. The world was over. And Noha, a boy who had watched from behind monitors, had chosen the final mercy for all.",2,1766493841.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1ptsy2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dormrooms/comments/1ptsy2v/moving_into_my_first_apartment_and_discovering/,Moving into my first apartment and discovering that furniture shopping is actually an emotional journey,"I never thought I’d be someone who gets sentimental about furniture, but here I am, spending my Saturday researching tavoli for my new place and feeling genuinely overwhelmed. This is my first apartment after living with roommates for six years, and suddenly every choice feels massive.

Do I get something modern and minimalist, or go for that rustic farmhouse look I’ve always admired? My mom keeps sending me pictures of dining tables saying I need something that can host family dinners. My best friend thinks I should get something small since it’s just me. I’m caught between being practical and buying something I absolutely love.

What’s making it harder is that I want this table to last. I don’t want to buy cheap furniture that falls apart in two years. I’ve been looking everywhere from local stores to checking international options on Alibaba, comparing quality and prices until my eyes hurt.

The thing is, I keep imagining my future around whatever table I choose. Morning coffee before work, late night conversations with friends, maybe someday even hosting Thanksgiving. Is it weird that choosing a table feels like I’m choosing what kind of adult I want to be? How did you all decide on your first real piece of furniture?",2,1766493594.0,dormrooms,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1ptson1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMidnightArchives/comments/1ptson1/lavender_upon_the_snow/,Lavender Upon The Snow,"No Christmas lasts forever.

The puppy from the box will lose its novelty, and grow big and stink - maybe make a mess on the floor once in a while. The decorations return to the attic and gather another year's worth of dust, assuming they remain in the same home at all. 

Extended families go back to their lives after a meal; presents become rubbish to be tidied. 

Normalcy resumes.

And the snow, however many blankets thick, will always melt as the first warm days of spring usher in.

Growing up, Christmas always came in twos. There was the one at home, with Mum and Dad, who remedied his jolly spirit with bottles - a day that stretched far too thin over alcohol clinks and small smiles. Something at dinner would go wrong, or someone’s gratitude for a gift would be 'underwhelming', and a voice would inevitably shout, another festive argument, and something always, *always* broke amidst intoxicated splendour. I would start to dread the day that tree emerged in our living room; fewer and fewer boxes under it every year. 

The second would be with my grandparents in their softer home, with their finer plates and my grandmother's fussing over second helpings - a happy few days of play-pretend, like I didn't know what was happening to the man who raised me. 

It soon became apparent that some things weren't being packed away with the tinsel, long after Christmas was over.

When I was old enough to understand words like 'cirrhosis’, the damage was already written in the yellowing of his eyes, as the holiday smell of alcohol had stuck to him for years aplenty. The final time I saw him on his feet was under the glow of the market tree lights, sweating and shivering, insisting via slurred jokes that he was fine while Mum pleaded with him to go to the hospital. 

""You need help, Darius. This has to stop.""

She'd refused to take him; refused to help him unless he wanted it, and begrudgingly settled for watching the man who gently placed a ring on her finger and danced their honeymoon away on tropical isles, drink himself to death.

Last Christmas Eve, he passed.

His liver, obviously. His body had finally done what the rest of us had been too afraid to do and simply refused to carry him any further. The house was quiet when the call came, the snow outside lying still and innocent, announcing that he'd run out of time.

Our home was mute; we'd used all our tears on him long ago, no more sympathy to muster. 

No more pain - for us, and for him.

It felt wrong without his blaring presence; the absence became a far heavier weight on our shoulders. Mum drifted around the house as if the floor might give out beneath her, gathering his untouched mugs and glasses, straightening the cushions he hadn't disturbed in weeks. At one point, she found his Santa hat from the folds of the couch, her fingers running smoothly over the cheap red cotton... and then she put it back exactly where she found it.

Grief didn't come in sobs and wails and talk, not for us. There was nothing to say that we hadn't already screamed at him: arguments, begs, threats, promises. No, it came in the sound of a humming fridge and a ticking clock and a creaking house fighting to stay warm.

I sat on my bed for most of the day, waiting for unsteady steps up the stairs or a wet cough that rattled the halls; for him to sway in the doorway, stinking, asking his champ if he wanted anything. But the space remained empty. When I did finally lie down, I stared at the ceiling and tried to picture his face - truly remember it, before his skin sallowed and dyed an ugly yellow. It kept slipping away, replaced with never enough hospital visits or the words we couldn't take back. 

So much left unsaid. 

I expected tears, some great shuddering release now that it was finally over, but instead I felt a tight, numb chest - my body choosing to feel nothing at all instead of untangling.

Sleep came in thin, broken pieces.

The next morning, I took the long, quiet bus ride to my grandparents' new house - my coat carrying the fleeting smell of our hush home. 

They'd moved a few months prior, trading a cosy cottage for a grand manor at the edge of a new town. Mum said it was a 'business opportunity' and that 'they deserved to retire somewhere nicer.' 

She didn't know the real reason they'd moved; I never asked.

The journey out felt different from the usual grey crawl of the city. Tall buildings and underpasses became soft hills and neat rows of trees, their bare branches laced with frost; fields lay out in clean, white sheets, and villages came and went, arranged for a catalogue, their wreath-clad cottages spitting out kids dragging sledges, laughing like life had never hurt them. 

Then I reached my stop, and I stepped into a movie.

The town was curated. Perfect, picturesque buildings; shop windows framed with garlands and little lights - gingerbread homes, toy trains - handwritten signs taped to the glass, handmade ornaments below, overhead street lights of stars and snowflakes. People sat inside cafes, cupping steaming mugs, faces flushed from anything but vexing arguments. I watched a family jostle each other outside a bakery, bags of pastries in hand, their breath clouding the air. 

The father wrapped a stern arm around his oldest son, laughing at a joke.

The bitterness rose quickly and sharply.

Of course, this was where I'd spend my day - a postcard-worthy town where the worst Christmas disaster is a dropped pudding. A town that received bad news slowly, if at all, and where someone like my Dad would enact his scenes safely out of frame - no one else aware if he died a night prior, a bus ride away, his liver shot to utter shit.

Another knot began to bundle in my chest.

My grandparents' new home sat just beyond the last cluster of houses, set back from the road behind a stone wall and a pair of iron gates painted cheerful green. The estate itself was old, with tall windows and steep, sloping roofs, but there was nothing harsh about its demeanour. Even the ivy climbed the stone in tidy ribbons, and smoke curled from the chimney in thin, friendly lines.

They had not held back on the decorations.

An utter vomit of light traced every window and balcony, glowing red, green and gold in the grim daylight. A pungent pine wreath hung on the door, dotted with red berries and a thick bow; a little nativity set and a pair of birch reindeer sat in the front garden, dusted with snow - a happy house, genuinely proud to be dressed up for the holidays.

It was almost too calm, too gentle. 

Mum hadn't accompanied me. Said she needed to stay behind to deal with... things. She'd moved more slowly that morning, like each step ached, before kissing my head at the bus station and telling me that I was safe with her folks. That being here, for however long, would do me good. And as I pushed open the gate and walked up the path lined with lanterns, I tried my damndest to believe her; that, maybe this year, Christmas could be as advertised. 

But in that moment, I felt more like an unwelcome package - a lad attending a pantomime in funeral clothes.

And that Christmas... would be unlike anything I'd ever known.

\-

The door swung open before I could knock.

My grandparents stood together, almost attached, framed by the hallway light. Nan's eyes were already red-rimmed, but she forced her mouth into some kind of smile; Grandad's hand hovered awkwardly at my shoulder, unable to decide between a pat or an embrace.

""Come in, dearie. You'll freeze out there."" Nan said quickly, stepping aside. 

They ushered me in with a rehearsed gentleness, careful not to mention his name; careful not to ask how I was. Their questions came in soft, practical murmurs: ""Did I sleep on the bus?"" Was I hungry?... all padding around the gloom that followed me inside, as if I were a skittish animal they might scare off. 

Warmth hit me in the face: the smell of baking dough, the low hiss of a radiator, some old song playing from another room. My coat was shrugged off my shoulders, my bag taken with a ""We'll stick this in your room for now,"" as I was manoeuvred down a polished hallway. 

""Nothing heavy today,"" Grandad said. ""Just a nice, quiet Christmas, yeah?""

I nodded.

That was when I first saw him.

At the end of a corridor was a door leading to a garden. A man stood amidst the thicket - dressed entirely in white. A thick woollen coat, pale trousers, gloves the shade of paper, even his hair, cut close to his skull, was almost colourless. 

Beside him sat a giant dog, all sharp muscle and thin grey fur, its shoulders level with the man's hip. Its eyes flicked to me: pale, yellow, assessing.

""Ah,"" Grandad said, following my gaze. ""You've seen our gardener.""

The man's eyes slowly found mine, and he politely bowed his head. His face was remarkably forgettable - his features too even, as if someone had drawn it from memory and left out the little human flaws of complexion. There was no dirt on his clothes, no mud on his boots, no trace of the cold in his cheeks despite the snow clinging to his dog's fur.

Nan's hand tightened briefly on my shoulder.

""You'll see him about,"" She said hastily. ""He keeps the grounds in order.""

The dog gave a low huff and nudged the man's hand. He rested gloved fingers between its ears, whispering something inaudible. 

""Come on, Leo,"" Grandad said brightly. ""Let's get you some cocoa.""

No name. No introduction. No mention of where he'd come from, or how long he'd worked here. And yet... his presence was an inescapable tug. A silent insistence somewhere in my head urged me to step away from my grandparents, walk down the hall, and hide within his garden.

But they steered me away, away from the corridor and the man who stood beyond its end until a corner cut him from view. He rarely moved; his dog did not - watching me go with pricked ears and unblinking eyes. 

And he was only the first of two strangers in that house.

I heard her before I saw her: a girl's voice humming a carol amidst the soft clatter of pans, bowls and the soft thud of wood hitting dough. I expected a maid, bustling and muttering about timings, but when we stepped into the kitchen, my eyes fell upon a girl my age - sleeves rolled and cheeks flushed, flour freckling her forearms. She was unsoundly pretty: her violet eyes too bright, her smile too ready, every movement deliberate as she pressed a cutter into a sheet of gingerbread, readying another platoon of men for their march into the oven; moving through the room as if she'd been born into it, reaching for jars and utensils from the right drawers and cupboards without even looking.

""Morning!"" She beamed, regarding us like we were customers.

My grandparents weren’t startled at the sight of her. No double-take, no fussed apology about not hearing her come in. Nan angled around the girl to the kettle, sidestepping a sprinkle of flour at her feet as if she'd done it a hundred times.

""You're going to spoil us rotten, girl."" She said with a grin, heaving spoonfuls of chocolate powder into mugs.

""Someone has to."" The girl said, as she looked at me, and her smile widened from ear to ear. ""Oh, you must be Leo! They've told me so much about you!""

""Aw, that's nice-who're you?""

Grandad's hand stayed firm on my shoulder. ""Lavender,"" he said with such pleasantry, ""neighbour's girl; helps out-""

""-and we'd be lost without her."" Nan cut in, her voice almost mute within the fizz of a kettle. ""I take it your *dad*\-"" the word carefully left her mouth, trying to keep it civil ""-isn't home?""

""Pff, is he ever.""

For just a moment, in the reflection of the oven's door, her face emptied of all cheerful demeanour. Not sad, or angry, just... blank. The door opened, and a wave of heat rolled across the room as she turned a tray of baking gingerbread, and then shut it with a bump of her thigh. And her smile returned - a light slotted back into place.

""Sit, lad,"" Grandad said, pulling out a chair, promising a drink, assuring me that the cheerful, helpful young lady who found herself in their home most days was the most fabulous baker in town. Up close, she smelled of sugar and spice and flowers, earning her namesake; little crescents of dough clung under her nails as she lifted a final cut-out from the board, a tiny frown pinched between her brow - gone in a flash, smoothed over by a sunny, over-eager grin I'd already decided didn't fit her. She accepted their fussing and praise with a dip of her head, a bright, gleeful sound in the back of her throat, her fingers finally satisfied with the work they'd made along one more tray. 

I understood the quiet drag underneath her brightness; the unsung gravity that orbited her. I felt it myself in classes, at gatherings with friends, at work, places where I stood too comfortably playing make-believe, scrounging up every trick I knew to not think about what once waited for me at home.

""You like gingerbread, right?"" She asked me from across the counter, almost panicked, offering me one of her fresher-baked soldiers from a bowl. The light above her burned steadily and warmly, glowing her face like a lost star. 

For the first time since my arrival, I smiled. ""I love it.""

And for the first time in the several minutes I'd known her, she smiled, *really* smiled, as I broke off my first piece.

It was delicious.

We had a whole day to kill, but every hour spent in that kitchen felt like an age built on borrowed joy.

Lavender soon decided that we were going out. It wasn't a question; it was an announcement made over sweeping crumbs and dishes to be washed. One moment, I was at the table with a mug in my hands; the next, I was being handed back my coat and told to put my boots on.

""You look comfortable,"" Lavender teased with a wink.

The cold was a sharp, clean steal of our breath as we stepped outside, waved on and off by my awestruck, giddy grandparents. Lavender tapped her boots, adjusted her scarf, patted down her puffer coat - the same colour as her eyes - before leading me along the crunching path that had carved my arrival. Lanterns remained on guard, their small flames bending when the wind shifted, swaying light across the snow.

The afternoon looked a little less grey.

We were halfway down the path when I saw him again, standing far off to the side, behind a little fence, where trimmed hedges gave way to bare-branched shrubs. His clothes were the same stark white as before; the dog still pressed against his leg, its fur stippled with a thin, ashen frost. He wasn't close enough to greet, nor far enough to ignore. Merely... placed, in that perfect length of distance that made me question whether we'd interrupted him or walked into his vision on purpose.

Lavender's stride stuttered before she angled her body towards me and forced my attention back to the front gate. ""Ugh."" She groaned, a bit too loudly. ""Y'know, your Grandad is very relieved to have a man for the grounds, but you think he could've chosen someone... a bit more normal.""

""Does he live here?"" I asked.

Her mouth tugged, almost a smirk, nearly a flinch.

""Sort of. He's always just... around.""

She never once looked at him, not directly. Her gaze skimmed over him, pretending not to see him, as her jaw tightened - a small muscle in her cheek flickering. The dog's eyes tracked us as we neared the gate, unblinking. Its owner didn't say anything or move, save for a slow, lazy tilt of his head, as if he were testing the wind.

I tried not to stare. I failed.

Lavender bumped my arm.

""Don't let him weird you out. He's harmless,"" she said, her hand reaching for the gate latch.

""Does he have a name?""

""Everyone does. Doesn't mean you need to know it.""

Before I could ask what in the hell that was supposed to mean, she swung open the gate and bound out onto the lane, her boots thumping into packed snow; she twirled, walking back a few paces, smile flaring back to full strength.

""Come on. Town won't admire itself.""

A gentle, decisive wind pushed at my back, preventing me from sneaking a last look at the silent pair likely still watching from their ordered shrubs, and nudged me onto the fluffy lane. I slipped and landed face-first into the snow. Lavender laughed, an impossibly joyful sound, and helped me to my feet as the latch clicked shut behind us. I fell into step beside her as she began her walk... and she looped an arm through mine as if it were the easiest thing in her life.

I did not object.

""Wait until you see the main cafe - you wouldn't have spotted it on the bus,"" her voice bounced down the still road. ""They do these *thicc* hot chocolates that will absolutely ruin your teeth.""

""As good as your gingerbread?""

She giggled, and I let her talk, letting the promise of sugared windows and a warm booth pull my attention on as the manor shrank away, and the hedges dropped into white fields, and the looming sense of eyes burning holes in the back of my head withered away with the cold. She rambled enough for both of us on the walk down, but there were meticulous gaps in her words; never giving too much of herself away, or prying into my personal life either. She told me which house puts its lights up too early every year, which shopkeeper slips extra chocolates to kids who know how to say please, and which old postman insists on sending cards over email. She told me about the winter fair they'd had in the square a few weeks back, about the jazz band that played despite their numb fingers, and the poor Santa whose beard kept slipping down. 

Her voice was paint, colouring the road ahead.

But whenever my questions strayed too close to her, she stepped around them like a patch of black ice.

""Do you live nearby?""

""Yeah, close enough,"" she tipped her head towards a hill of houses. ""Takes no time to reach your grandparents - they are *much* nicer than the last couple who lived there.""

""Siblings?""

""Huh? Me? No, just... me and the old man,"" she answered far too quickly. ""All the attention, all the disappointment, aha.""

""... does he know where you are?""

""Oh yeah - usually. He's just so, so busy with work, y'know.""

She'd rehearsed this - had practised these conversations enough times to know exactly which bits to leave out. But she hadn't trained her face enough. There were moments the wind would slap colour into her cheeks, and she'd glance off, and something hollow, fast and raw would flash behind her eyes. A tiredness far older than the years she'd lived; one I recognised from my bathroom mirror, in the early hours of the morning, as my parents argued a floor below, and I would wonder how bad it would get this time - powerless to stop it. Again and again.

She bore a look I'd known; a look I'd worn. A look I wasn't quite free from.

By the time we reached town, the sky had peeled itself back to a washed blue. I noticed more homes this time than on my entry - clean brick fronts with green or red doors. The road widened, curving between shopfronts, and whatever prior bitterness it had instilled in me was washed away by wonder; ugly knots in my chest were banished by another endless sea of words that spilt from the girl beside me, who made it her mission to lore-dump every detail that encompassed her delightful, festive home.

A grand cafe sat in a corner where the street dipped slightly, its windows fogged and decorated with painted snowflakes, catching the sunlight in little bursts of silver. 

""Best place to be,"" Lavender announced, as the murmur from inside grew warmer. A bell chimed as she pushed open the door, and a thick, sweet waft of coffee and sugar and baked treats swarmed me.

We drifted through the buzz and laughter to an alcoved window booth half-sunk into the wall, its padded seats wrapped in a cracked red vinyl, the table lined with jars of holly and little plates of delicate biscuits. Some berries lined the window shelf; a few had wilted into dark, crumpled dots. Lavender slid into the corner like she was reclaiming a throne, nudging aside a folded newspaper and a sugar jar.

""Welcome to my favourite corner on Earth."" She said, watching people drift past the window in soft focus as a gentle, obedient snowfall began. 

""Should I be honoured?"" I sank opposite, and the booth creaked.

""Deeply. I only share it with fellow carriers of baggage."" She said it like a joke, but there was an assessing glint in her eyes, a quick and measuring test of the waters. I'd earned it.

""My grandparents told you.""

She nodded.

""... Leo, I'm-""

A waitress brought over drinks without being asked, sliding in front of us a pair of steaming, hefty mugs filled with chocolate and marshmallows. 

""On your usual tab, Lav.""

""Ooo, you're a star, Ellie.""

""I know.""

Ellie moved away, and 'Lav' turned back to me, cupping her mug in both hands, the steam haloing her face and revealing a friendly, intent watching from her eyes.

""You come here a lot then,"" I said.

""Outstanding deduction, detective. Any others?"" 

""You got friends to bother?""

She gave a little shrug.

""Yeah, of course! But they have lives, normal ones. Here's better,"" she glanced around the cafe. ""People come in a bit worn. They sit, and they talk, or they rest, and then they leave looking... a little lighter.""

""Sounds nice to watch.""

One of her hands slid across the table and gently cupped mine.

""What're you-""

""How do you feel?"" She asked in the most delicate tone I believe a human could ever muster.

""Lavender, no offence, but-""

She cut me off again as something cold wormed under the warmth in my chest.

""He was a selfish prick, Leo; he treated you and your Mum like shit. Start with whatever hurts most. It's not an heirloom to be hoarded; it's rubbish - bin some of it here.""

I stared at my mug, bewildered by her words and the bluntness of how she said them. The cream was already collapsing, leaving brown islands of cocoa, and new drips crashed into the mounds, gently overflowing the drink.

Fuck, I was crying. I was crying, and she didn't even flinch. 

""I don't-""

""Yes, you do.""

It boiled out of me inexplicably, uncontrolled and ugly as I vented through heaving, quiet sobs. 

'What hurt most'

""Ugh, mum was out, so I hid bottles from him once... fuck, I-"" I wiped my eyes, ""-God, I just wanted it all to stop, if only for a night... and he just fucking *laughed* when he found out, like he was proud of me, like he thought it was cute, and he put his hand tight, like, really, really fucking tight on my shoulder and it just hurt so... so much. I hadn't... looked at him properly in months, and I didn't recognise who was looking down at me, and-"" she rubbed a gentle thumb over the back of my hand ""-he got paralytic that night... fucking, crawled on the floor in his underwear, I-"" I laughed a little at how truly absurd the memory was, ""-he passed out in a puddle of piss."" I laughed again. ""Fuck, he called me worthless, then said he loved me and then said I was a... fucking retard, or something and that I wasn't welcome in his house and screamed that he was going to kill me... and then he woke up the next morning like nothing fucking happened. Asking me what I wanted for dinner, like he wasn't going to do it all again in a few hours.""

Her eyes brightened, like I'd given her exactly what she wanted.

""When Mum told me he was gone, I... fuck, I thought that it was easier."" I hated the words as they left my tongue. ""Not better, just... simpler, I don't know. Like, there'd be no more waiting for the next shitshow, but-""

""That's enough,"" she said quietly. ""Feel better?""

I did, like I'd ripped a growing rot out from within, but then I shifted, suddenly needing her attention off of me.

""What about your dad, huh?"" I asked, regaining my composure, thankful that no patron noticed me devolve into a blubbering mess. ""You must have thoughts.""

She went still and took a deep breath.

""I'm counting down the days... waiting to see what gets him first: bottle, car, or stairs."" She gave a tiny, hideous laugh. ""And when it happens, I'll be relieved and hate myself for it.""

""That's..."" I started.

""Familiar?"" 

Of course, she understood. A happy, sad girl comforting a sadder boy, sharing a similar burden.

She watched me a precious beat longer, and I her, until she seemed to shake herself out of a trance.

""Right,"" she beamed, straightening up. ""I have a proposal.""

""Do you now?""

""Yes. We neck this-"" she lifted her mug ""-and ditch this therapy corner because I want to show you something.""

""And that would be... what?""

She nodded towards the window, where the gentle snow thickened into a pale blur.

""There's a bit of woods just past town. It's quiet. No lights, no carols, just trees and snow and an occasional squirrel and a dainty little spot where I go when the world feels a bit loud.""

""We can stay here, Lav.""

She raised her mug in a mock-toast.

""Leo, you look like you're about ten seconds away from smashing your head into this table. Trust me, we can sulk in better scenery.""

There was something in the way she said it - playful, coaxing and edged with purpose. Before I could think, she tipped her head back and drained her drink in one go, wincing when the heat hit her. I found it would be easier to follow her than argue, so I gulped down my thick, sickly sweet drink and followed her briskly out the door as she almost skipped away.

The town quickly thinned into fields, the fields into a scrabble of plump trees, and the footpath I imagined wasn't a path at all, more a trample into the snow by boots and paws and whatever else wandered out here. The air bit sharper the further we went, swallowing the town's sounds until all that remained was the creak of our steps and huff of our breath.

Conversation had slid back into mostly safer territory. She lectured me about her class life and the school she absolutely hated, but would miss; her hopes and dreams of becoming an actress and making it on her own... and the rumours that my grandparents' manor once, long ago, belonged to some lord whose wife went mad and threw herself from a balcony. I answered when I had to; joked when I could, and every now and then, she would flick her eyes back to me, checking I was still there and not on the verge of crumbling again. Not yet.

Finally, the trees broke into a clearing where a frozen lake lay; a perfect, dull mirror pressed into the earth. Snow had caked its surface, except where the wind had cleared thin, glassy veins, dark water shimmering below, surrounded by a ring of trodden shore where previous admirers had stood. 

Lavender took a long, tired breath, as if she'd been holding it the whole walk.

""See? Quiet.""

She led me to a fallen log buried in snow, brushed off a space with her glove, and plopped herself down. I sat beside her, the wood cold enough to sting through my clothes, as the lake creaked somewhere deep - a slow, pained groan like some giant turned over in its sleep.

A weight pressed on my ribs.

""Is this where you bring all your emotionally constipated boys after a cafe date?"" I asked.

""Just the special ones,"" she said. ""Don't get cocky."" She watched the lake, boot tapping a slow, nervous rhythm into the log. When she did look at me, the brightness had drained from her eyes, leaving something empty in its wake. ""Leo,"" she said. Just my name. No cute flair, no giggle tucked in.

My hands tightened around the log, threatening to snap the bark with a brittle crack.

""...yeah?""

She studied me, deciding which version of herself she'd lead with - the bouncy, sweet girl from the kitchen or the one from the booth who'd ripped me open with a handful of words. 

When she spoke, it came in a low, careful tone.

""When my dad's... being himself, I come here. Because if I don't, I'm going to take a kitchen knife and ram it into the back of his head.""

I gasped out a weak laugh.

""Ah, relatable.""

""Yeah."" Her eyes went to my crotch. ""I know what it's like to bottle things up.""

A shiver walked its way up my back as she shifted closer, our shoulders touching now, the smell of sugar and spice and flowers still wrapped around her.

""You're carrying so much of him. He's gone, but he's still... in there."" She tapped, very gently, two fingers over my chest. ""Everything he ever said. Every threat. Every time he scared you. And I bet he never said sorry.""

I swallowed hard.

""Yeah, well,"" I said hoarsely, as her other hand found my thigh. ""It's never going to just... go away.""

Her eyes exploded at that.

""No,"" she agreed, nodding. ""It doesn't. Not by itself.""

The lake popped again.

She took a delicate breath, and each word felt perfectly rehearsed. Not just in front of a mirror, or in the shower, but in far quieter, stranger places.

""I can help you. If you want.""

I tried to laugh her off. ""You already did. Café, remember?""

She shook her head.

""Talking helps, sure. But it doesn't burn the worst of it. That part sits in you; it hurts to even think about letting it go."" Her gaze flicked to the ice, her expression unreadable, and then she looked back to me, and I think I saw just how *old* she could've been. ""I can take it away.""

The question splattered on our laps, foul and awful.

""... what?""

""Your pain,"" she said, as if it were a mundane offer. ""The weight. I can take it, Leo.""

A blunt, stupid surge of anger flared up, quick and defensive, as I stood - much to her disapproval.

""Lav, that's not funny.""

""I'm not joking."" There was no smile anymore, not even a hint. ""You don't have to carry on. There'll be nights you can't sleep, you'll flinch when someone raises their voice, you'll wait by the door like he might stumble through it, even though you *know* he won't."" Her eye twitched; I think she'd stopped blinking, too. ""Let me take that from you. All of it. And you'll only remember the version of him you want.""

For a fleeting moment - one, sharp, traitorous moment - I imagined it.

I imagined a future where I didn't brace at slammed doors, or Intoxicated people didn't make me nervous, and I could evolve into a strong, young man that my Mum could be proud of. I imagined thinking of him and not being met with yellow eyes, or a hospital bed and a deteriorating man, or that crooked, sloppy grin he wore before he made a mess.

*Light*. The word floated around in my head, dizzy and... wrong. I could be light. Forever.

But then other pictures pushed in. Him hoisting me onto his shoulder, only a toddler, to watch a live show. His terrible, off-key singing he performed while sober, for there was, an age ago, a version of him that didn't drink. The night he cried when I thought I was asleep, thinking he'd broken my arm, whispering forgotten apologies in the dark; replaced with something pungent. 

It tangled together - the good, the monstrous, the pathetic, the pitiful... the hopeful. I couldn't sort it into piles, couldn't 'keep' and 'throw away'. It was him, all of it. The whole awful mess of him.

My dad.

*My* Dad!

""I-"" my voice came out scratchy. I cleared my throat as she watched me with unbearable patience. ""No, Lavender. That's... no.""

Her expression didn't waver as the lake creaked one final time, a long and low guttural moan of grief. She leaned back, resting her hands on her lap, and broke her eyes away from me and aimed them at the sky.

""I understand."" 

Her smile returned in degrees, too slow, reaching her mouth first, then her cheeks, but not quite reaching her eyes.

""...Lav?""

A minuscule, cracked laugh fell out of her as the wind stirred, lifting curls of her hair, but it was not just her locks anymore; fine, colourless threads traced from her head to the branches above, trapping light like crystal, and mapping patterns high in the trees that seemed invisible before. 

""You would've been perfect,"" there was a soft disappointment in her words. ""I would've... picked you clean, and you would've known only peace."" She uncurled some fingers, palm up, and something sticky lathered from them - a strand that slowly stretched into the air between us. Inside the humming thread, like flies in amber, twitched half-formed pictures: my dad on a carpet, a hospital bed, yellow eyes lost in yellow glass. I flinched back as the strand snapped with a crack, whipping away and vanishing into her sleeve. 

The woods exhaled, and all at once the sky above grew dim, as if a sheet of clouds had rolled over the sun, and the branches revealed a structure I hadn't understood in the light. 

Webbing. 

Not a veil, but a ceiling, strung from trunk to trunk in thick, glinting ropes; huge layers of silk sagged between the pines, and as the light shifted, they came alive. Images rippled across them like old film reels: strangers at a bedside, a boy in a smashed-up kitchen, a woman crying alone in a car.

Lavender rose.

The log screamed as if something far heavier than a girl had left it. Her coat bulged and split and then peeled away like shed skin, and what uncoiled from within were enormous, pale, jointed limbs unfolding with a slow, mortifying grace, each leg longer than I was tall. Her torso stretched and thinned, and a swollen white abdomen swayed up from behind her, veined with faint colours and laced with moving shadows. Her small, familiar face rode at the front of the mass, dragging up with it - eyes now faceted, multiplying me into a dozen tiny figures. 

Above, one of the larger webs sparked to life. Not a stranger, but my grandparents in their old cottage. They were younger, much younger, faces raw from crying. Grandad held something wrapped in a blanket that was far, far too small - a dead bundle they rended their faces from.

""They gave me that one."" Lavender's voice came from her huge, arachnid body - layered, echoed... ancient. She loomed between the trees, more a white shadow than a shape. ""So your mother could be their only."" Her massive limbs flexed, testing their reach, and the web-screens shivered with a thousand captured griefs. But her eyes were fixed only on me... starving. ""You could have been happy, Leo. But you chose to keep him. You will carry that alone, *always.*""

My heart felt like it would burst, staring up at a memory of an aunt I never knew had been born, and at the vast white spider that still wore a girl's smile.

Another sheet stirred, tinted in a pale violet. The scene was faint and grainy, the room choked with old furniture; a squat television with dials hunched in a corner, and a man staggered across the room, shouting at someone. He kicks a coffee table, sending ash and cards flying into the air.

Then she steps in, exhausted and empty inside.

She's younger as well - not by a year or two, but by an era. Her hair is tied back with a ribbon, her dress hem brushes her knees, but her eyes are the same colour. She hides a knife behind her back and then lunges for his head before he can turn around. Snow drifts in through a cracked window, scribbling white along the floor; she is on his back, stabbing until he goes still as snowflakes catch in her hair and litter her face. 

The silk pulsed once, and the image faded.

""My first,"" the spider said, almost fondly. It crooned above me, shifting, its eyes twinkling down from an impossible height. ""She awoke me that night; showed me what could be taken."" A blob of saliva dropped from its mouth, melting the snow beside me, as it opened a maw of ravenous teeth. ""Fret not... you'll see her again soon.""

The spider began to descend. 

One long, pale leg settled silently, merely a step from my boot.

Another limb followed.

Something moved at the edges of the trees. A shape slipped between the trunks, almost colourless against the snow - manifesting as a tall man in a white coat, a great grey dog at his heel. They didn't crash through the undergrowth to my rescue; they were just suddenly,,, there, as if they had been the entire time.

""That's enough."" The Gardener's voice was quiet, but it cut deep across the humming web like a bullet, and through the earth.

The spider froze a breath away from my shoulder. It hesitated, afraid, all those faceted eyes swivelled, fixing not on me, but on him. The dog growled, a low warning that seemed to run down the trees and into the roots.

""He said no,"" the Gardener added, standing just beyond the ring of trees, one hand resting lightly on his dog's neck. Not a lick of fear touched him, no surprise at the looming thing towering over us, only the sternness of a man who knew the rules. ""You don't take what isn't given.""

The spider twitched, a ripple ran through its veins, and I glimpsed Lavender's sulking face. 

""He is drowning!"" It spat. ""One strand and he could breathe again! Is that not why he's here?!"" The webs above vibrated with frustration, their images shivering, stuttering, and buffering.

""He was here to choose, not feed you."" He stepped forward, just once, and the spider recoiled. The dog padded beside him, ears raised, its eyes locked on the nearest limb. ""You have your winter; you've eaten well."" His gaze finally met me. ""But this one goes home.""

The great white legs spasmed and snapped up, whipping snow into the air, as it drew itself far back into a high dark, folding her bulk between the trunks.

""You're soft,"" it hissed, thwarted.

The man tutted, waving his hand. ""Back to your work. There'll be others.""

A tremor ran through the webs - irritation, or laughter, or both. On the nearest web, a familiar snow-dusted girl looked up from her kill with violet eyes, smiling at me across all that distance. Then the image dulled, flatlining into nothing.

""Come, boy,"" said the Gardener, turning as his dog fell into step, and headed back towards the path leading to town. ""Your mother's here. Best not keep her waiting.""

I looked once more into the trees, at ghostly webs dissolving into branches, and the fathomless dark hiding a girl-shaped monster. Then I forced my legs to move, crunching after a man and his silent hound, at a complete loss for words.

\-

Mum was pink-cheeked from the cold and utterly blown away by her parents' new home. She spotted me first and crushed me into a hug that stole my breath, fingers digging into my back. She bombarded me with a million questions; my answers were tired and brief, but it warmed me to see that her smile wasn't patched together for once.

Nan moaned about her coat being too small; Grandad poured her something strong and pretended not to be surprised when she chugged it. We ended up in the kitchen, absent its little baker. Mum perched on a stool with a forgotten tea, laughing at one of Nan's awful jokes, and I watched the corners of her mouth soften, and the endless brace in her shoulders slack slightly. Her hand found my knee under the table and rested there, a simple gesture that said far more than any apology neither of us had tried.

She met Lavender later that afternoon. Just a girl in a greased apron, helping Nan prep the roast, pressing a warm parsnip into her hand.

""You must be Leo's Mum!"" She beamed. ""Boy, I tell you - your son has been a delight!"" 

Mum grew flustered at that, a kind of pleased embarrassment she hadn't been allowed to feel in years. Lavender laughed at her jokes, eyes bright; just a neighbour's girl who knew how to fit in, and I tried not to throw up in my mouth.

Dinner came, and Mum leaned over to me, voice low and warm with wine she could actually enjoy. 

""I think that girl likes you."" A gentle, tipsy, incredulous smile tugged at her mouth. ""And, you know... I think this might be a Christmas to remember.""

I nodded, swallowing down the knot in my throat, and squeezed her hand. Outside, the snow did not cease, and somewhere beyond the windows a garden slept. 

""You have no idea,"" I said, trying my hardest to ignore the pair of kind, violet eyes that could never seem to look away, watching my mother with a hopeful, eternally famished hunger.

Our day to day is basically just going to work while he works from home, me coming home having dinner with him (watching a show together while we do so) and basically I'll go off to bed and he would end up playing his ps5 for a couple of hours more. He helps with the chores and I usually prepare meals. He also occasionally takes on finance trading. I know he tries to do his best for us but I just feel like it's not enough. We go on a holiday once a year and in between the year he would get me a few gifts here and there. He would plan maybe 1 trip within the country on a long weekend off. I love when he shows initiatiative but it's onlt like once to twice throughout the year usually after an argument. However I feel like in terms of romance, that department is lacking. On weekends we would just do our part of chores and stay home. I would try to initiate conversations but he's usually busy or doesnt pay me mind. I would wake him up gently with a nice cup of coffee before work and he would get annoyed. After all this he says that I'm argumentative abd not feminine enough. I can be argumentative but only as a way to stand up for what I think it's right. I have no issues apologising if I did wrong in a matter. Now, going to bed alone leaves me feeling that we don't have as much intimacy as I would like and I personally feel that we are more like roommates sometimes. I don't know if this is normal. Have raised the matter to him and his response is that he's busy working hard for us which I understand but I just don't know why in between the whole process, life can't be enjoyable.

Edit: recently things have been worse, we got into a huge fight over a trivial matter and he has been physical. This is not the first time it has happened. Each time this does I rethink the whole relationship and start to stay away from him. I don't know if I should pursue this relationship as things have been serious and we are wanting to get married. I've asked him for a break and am now just taking time to myself and talking to other people (not romantically but just to get my mind off of things for a while)

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

1ptsnub,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ptsnub/lavender_upon_the_snow/,Lavender Upon The Snow,"No Christmas lasts forever.

The puppy from the box will lose its novelty, and grow big and stink - maybe make a mess on the floor once in a while. The decorations return to the attic and gather another year's worth of dust, assuming they remain in the same home at all. 

Extended families go back to their lives after a meal; presents become rubbish to be tidied. 

Normalcy resumes.

And the snow, however many blankets thick, will always melt as the first warm days of spring usher in.

Growing up, Christmas always came in twos. There was the one at home, with Mum and Dad, who remedied his jolly spirit with bottles - a day that stretched far too thin over alcohol clinks and small smiles. Something at dinner would go wrong, or someone’s gratitude for a gift would be 'underwhelming', and a voice would inevitably shout, another festive argument, and something always, *always* broke amidst intoxicated splendour. I would start to dread the day that tree emerged in our living room; fewer and fewer boxes under it every year. 

The second would be with my grandparents in their softer home, with their finer plates and my grandmother's fussing over second helpings - a happy few days of play-pretend, like I didn't know what was happening to the man who raised me. 

It soon became apparent that some things weren't being packed away with the tinsel, long after Christmas was over.

When I was old enough to understand words like 'cirrhosis’, the damage was already written in the yellowing of his eyes, as the holiday smell of alcohol had stuck to him for years aplenty. The final time I saw him on his feet was under the glow of the market tree lights, sweating and shivering, insisting via slurred jokes that he was fine while Mum pleaded with him to go to the hospital. 

""You need help, Darius. This has to stop.""

She'd refused to take him; refused to help him unless he wanted it, and begrudgingly settled for watching the man who gently placed a ring on her finger and danced their honeymoon away on tropical isles, drink himself to death.

Last Christmas Eve, he passed.

His liver, obviously. His body had finally done what the rest of us had been too afraid to do and simply refused to carry him any further. The house was quiet when the call came, the snow outside lying still and innocent, announcing that he'd run out of time.

Our home was mute; we'd used all our tears on him long ago, no more sympathy to muster. 

No more pain - for us, and for him.

It felt wrong without his blaring presence; the absence became a far heavier weight on our shoulders. Mum drifted around the house as if the floor might give out beneath her, gathering his untouched mugs and glasses, straightening the cushions he hadn't disturbed in weeks. At one point, she found his Santa hat from the folds of the couch, her fingers running smoothly over the cheap red cotton... and then she put it back exactly where she found it.

Grief didn't come in sobs and wails and talk, not for us. There was nothing to say that we hadn't already screamed at him: arguments, begs, threats, promises. No, it came in the sound of a humming fridge and a ticking clock and a creaking house fighting to stay warm.

I sat on my bed for most of the day, waiting for unsteady steps up the stairs or a wet cough that rattled the halls; for him to sway in the doorway, stinking, asking his champ if he wanted anything. But the space remained empty. When I did finally lie down, I stared at the ceiling and tried to picture his face - truly remember it, before his skin sallowed and dyed an ugly yellow. It kept slipping away, replaced with never enough hospital visits or the words we couldn't take back. 

So much left unsaid. 

I expected tears, some great shuddering release now that it was finally over, but instead I felt a tight, numb chest - my body choosing to feel nothing at all instead of untangling.

Sleep came in thin, broken pieces.

The next morning, I took the long, quiet bus ride to my grandparents' new house - my coat carrying the fleeting smell of our hush home. 

They'd moved a few months prior, trading a cosy cottage for a grand manor at the edge of a new town. Mum said it was a 'business opportunity' and that 'they deserved to retire somewhere nicer.' 

She didn't know the real reason they'd moved; I never asked.

The journey out felt different from the usual grey crawl of the city. Tall buildings and underpasses became soft hills and neat rows of trees, their bare branches laced with frost; fields lay out in clean, white sheets, and villages came and went, arranged for a catalogue, their wreath-clad cottages spitting out kids dragging sledges, laughing like life had never hurt them. 

Then I reached my stop, and I stepped into a movie.

The town was curated. Perfect, picturesque buildings; shop windows framed with garlands and little lights - gingerbread homes, toy trains - handwritten signs taped to the glass, handmade ornaments below, overhead street lights of stars and snowflakes. People sat inside cafes, cupping steaming mugs, faces flushed from anything but vexing arguments. I watched a family jostle each other outside a bakery, bags of pastries in hand, their breath clouding the air. 

The father wrapped a stern arm around his oldest son, laughing at a joke.

The bitterness rose quickly and sharply.

Of course, this was where I'd spend my day - a postcard-worthy town where the worst Christmas disaster is a dropped pudding. A town that received bad news slowly, if at all, and where someone like my Dad would enact his scenes safely out of frame - no one else aware if he died a night prior, a bus ride away, his liver shot to utter shit.

Another knot began to bundle in my chest.

My grandparents' new home sat just beyond the last cluster of houses, set back from the road behind a stone wall and a pair of iron gates painted cheerful green. The estate itself was old, with tall windows and steep, sloping roofs, but there was nothing harsh about its demeanour. Even the ivy climbed the stone in tidy ribbons, and smoke curled from the chimney in thin, friendly lines.

They had not held back on the decorations.

An utter vomit of light traced every window and balcony, glowing red, green and gold in the grim daylight. A pungent pine wreath hung on the door, dotted with red berries and a thick bow; a little nativity set and a pair of birch reindeer sat in the front garden, dusted with snow - a happy house, genuinely proud to be dressed up for the holidays.

It was almost too calm, too gentle. 

Mum hadn't accompanied me. Said she needed to stay behind to deal with... things. She'd moved more slowly that morning, like each step ached, before kissing my head at the bus station and telling me that I was safe with her folks. That being here, for however long, would do me good. And as I pushed open the gate and walked up the path lined with lanterns, I tried my damndest to believe her; that, maybe this year, Christmas could be as advertised. 

But in that moment, I felt more like an unwelcome package - a lad attending a pantomime in funeral clothes.

And that Christmas... would be unlike anything I'd ever known.

\-

The door swung open before I could knock.

My grandparents stood together, almost attached, framed by the hallway light. Nan's eyes were already red-rimmed, but she forced her mouth into some kind of smile; Grandad's hand hovered awkwardly at my shoulder, unable to decide between a pat or an embrace.

""Come in, dearie. You'll freeze out there."" Nan said quickly, stepping aside. 

They ushered me in with a rehearsed gentleness, careful not to mention his name; careful not to ask how I was. Their questions came in soft, practical murmurs: ""Did I sleep on the bus?"" Was I hungry?... all padding around the gloom that followed me inside, as if I were a skittish animal they might scare off. 

Warmth hit me in the face: the smell of baking dough, the low hiss of a radiator, some old song playing from another room. My coat was shrugged off my shoulders, my bag taken with a ""We'll stick this in your room for now,"" as I was manoeuvred down a polished hallway. 

""Nothing heavy today,"" Grandad said. ""Just a nice, quiet Christmas, yeah?""

I nodded.

That was when I first saw him.

At the end of a corridor was a door leading to a garden. A man stood amidst the thicket - dressed entirely in white. A thick woollen coat, pale trousers, gloves the shade of paper, even his hair, cut close to his skull, was almost colourless. 

Beside him sat a giant dog, all sharp muscle and thin grey fur, its shoulders level with the man's hip. Its eyes flicked to me: pale, yellow, assessing.

""Ah,"" Grandad said, following my gaze. ""You've seen our gardener.""

The man's eyes slowly found mine, and he politely bowed his head. His face was remarkably forgettable - his features too even, as if someone had drawn it from memory and left out the little human flaws of complexion. There was no dirt on his clothes, no mud on his boots, no trace of the cold in his cheeks despite the snow clinging to his dog's fur.

Nan's hand tightened briefly on my shoulder.

""You'll see him about,"" She said hastily. ""He keeps the grounds in order.""

The dog gave a low huff and nudged the man's hand. He rested gloved fingers between its ears, whispering something inaudible. 

""Come on, Leo,"" Grandad said brightly. ""Let's get you some cocoa.""

No name. No introduction. No mention of where he'd come from, or how long he'd worked here. And yet... his presence was an inescapable tug. A silent insistence somewhere in my head urged me to step away from my grandparents, walk down the hall, and hide within his garden.

But they steered me away, away from the corridor and the man who stood beyond its end until a corner cut him from view. He rarely moved; his dog did not - watching me go with pricked ears and unblinking eyes. 

And he was only the first of two strangers in that house.

I heard her before I saw her: a girl's voice humming a carol amidst the soft clatter of pans, bowls and the soft thud of wood hitting dough. I expected a maid, bustling and muttering about timings, but when we stepped into the kitchen, my eyes fell upon a girl my age - sleeves rolled and cheeks flushed, flour freckling her forearms. She was unsoundly pretty: her violet eyes too bright, her smile too ready, every movement deliberate as she pressed a cutter into a sheet of gingerbread, readying another platoon of men for their march into the oven; moving through the room as if she'd been born into it, reaching for jars and utensils from the right drawers and cupboards without even looking.

""Morning!"" She beamed, regarding us like we were customers.

My grandparents weren’t startled at the sight of her. No double-take, no fussed apology about not hearing her come in. Nan angled around the girl to the kettle, sidestepping a sprinkle of flour at her feet as if she'd done it a hundred times.

""You're going to spoil us rotten, girl."" She said with a grin, heaving spoonfuls of chocolate powder into mugs.

""Someone has to."" The girl said, as she looked at me, and her smile widened from ear to ear. ""Oh, you must be Leo! They've told me so much about you!""

""Aw, that's nice-who're you?""

Grandad's hand stayed firm on my shoulder. ""Lavender,"" he said with such pleasantry, ""neighbour's girl; helps out-""

""-and we'd be lost without her."" Nan cut in, her voice almost mute within the fizz of a kettle. ""I take it your *dad*\-"" the word carefully left her mouth, trying to keep it civil ""-isn't home?""

""Pff, is he ever.""

For just a moment, in the reflection of the oven's door, her face emptied of all cheerful demeanour. Not sad, or angry, just... blank. The door opened, and a wave of heat rolled across the room as she turned a tray of baking gingerbread, and then shut it with a bump of her thigh. And her smile returned - a light slotted back into place.

""Sit, lad,"" Grandad said, pulling out a chair, promising a drink, assuring me that the cheerful, helpful young lady who found herself in their home most days was the most fabulous baker in town. Up close, she smelled of sugar and spice and flowers, earning her namesake; little crescents of dough clung under her nails as she lifted a final cut-out from the board, a tiny frown pinched between her brow - gone in a flash, smoothed over by a sunny, over-eager grin I'd already decided didn't fit her. She accepted their fussing and praise with a dip of her head, a bright, gleeful sound in the back of her throat, her fingers finally satisfied with the work they'd made along one more tray. 

I understood the quiet drag underneath her brightness; the unsung gravity that orbited her. I felt it myself in classes, at gatherings with friends, at work, places where I stood too comfortably playing make-believe, scrounging up every trick I knew to not think about what once waited for me at home.

""You like gingerbread, right?"" She asked me from across the counter, almost panicked, offering me one of her fresher-baked soldiers from a bowl. The light above her burned steadily and warmly, glowing her face like a lost star. 

For the first time since my arrival, I smiled. ""I love it.""

And for the first time in the several minutes I'd known her, she smiled, *really* smiled, as I broke off my first piece.

It was delicious.

We had a whole day to kill, but every hour spent in that kitchen felt like an age built on borrowed joy.

Lavender soon decided that we were going out. It wasn't a question; it was an announcement made over sweeping crumbs and dishes to be washed. One moment, I was at the table with a mug in my hands; the next, I was being handed back my coat and told to put my boots on.

""You look comfortable,"" Lavender teased with a wink.

The cold was a sharp, clean steal of our breath as we stepped outside, waved on and off by my awestruck, giddy grandparents. Lavender tapped her boots, adjusted her scarf, patted down her puffer coat - the same colour as her eyes - before leading me along the crunching path that had carved my arrival. Lanterns remained on guard, their small flames bending when the wind shifted, swaying light across the snow.

The afternoon looked a little less grey.

We were halfway down the path when I saw him again, standing far off to the side, behind a little fence, where trimmed hedges gave way to bare-branched shrubs. His clothes were the same stark white as before; the dog still pressed against his leg, its fur stippled with a thin, ashen frost. He wasn't close enough to greet, nor far enough to ignore. Merely... placed, in that perfect length of distance that made me question whether we'd interrupted him or walked into his vision on purpose.

Lavender's stride stuttered before she angled her body towards me and forced my attention back to the front gate. ""Ugh."" She groaned, a bit too loudly. ""Y'know, your Grandad is very relieved to have a man for the grounds, but you think he could've chosen someone... a bit more normal.""

""Does he live here?"" I asked.

Her mouth tugged, almost a smirk, nearly a flinch.

""Sort of. He's always just... around.""

She never once looked at him, not directly. Her gaze skimmed over him, pretending not to see him, as her jaw tightened - a small muscle in her cheek flickering. The dog's eyes tracked us as we neared the gate, unblinking. Its owner didn't say anything or move, save for a slow, lazy tilt of his head, as if he were testing the wind.

I tried not to stare. I failed.

Lavender bumped my arm.

""Don't let him weird you out. He's harmless,"" she said, her hand reaching for the gate latch.

""Does he have a name?""

""Everyone does. Doesn't mean you need to know it.""

Before I could ask what in the hell that was supposed to mean, she swung open the gate and bound out onto the lane, her boots thumping into packed snow; she twirled, walking back a few paces, smile flaring back to full strength.

""Come on. Town won't admire itself.""

A gentle, decisive wind pushed at my back, preventing me from sneaking a last look at the silent pair likely still watching from their ordered shrubs, and nudged me onto the fluffy lane. I slipped and landed face-first into the snow. Lavender laughed, an impossibly joyful sound, and helped me to my feet as the latch clicked shut behind us. I fell into step beside her as she began her walk... and she looped an arm through mine as if it were the easiest thing in her life.

I did not object.

""Wait until you see the main cafe - you wouldn't have spotted it on the bus,"" her voice bounced down the still road. ""They do these *thicc* hot chocolates that will absolutely ruin your teeth.""

""As good as your gingerbread?""

She giggled, and I let her talk, letting the promise of sugared windows and a warm booth pull my attention on as the manor shrank away, and the hedges dropped into white fields, and the looming sense of eyes burning holes in the back of my head withered away with the cold. She rambled enough for both of us on the walk down, but there were meticulous gaps in her words; never giving too much of herself away, or prying into my personal life either. She told me which house puts its lights up too early every year, which shopkeeper slips extra chocolates to kids who know how to say please, and which old postman insists on sending cards over email. She told me about the winter fair they'd had in the square a few weeks back, about the jazz band that played despite their numb fingers, and the poor Santa whose beard kept slipping down. 

Her voice was paint, colouring the road ahead.

But whenever my questions strayed too close to her, she stepped around them like a patch of black ice.

""Do you live nearby?""

""Yeah, close enough,"" she tipped her head towards a hill of houses. ""Takes no time to reach your grandparents - they are *much* nicer than the last couple who lived there.""

""Siblings?""

""Huh? Me? No, just... me and the old man,"" she answered far too quickly. ""All the attention, all the disappointment, aha.""

""... does he know where you are?""

""Oh yeah - usually. He's just so, so busy with work, y'know.""

She'd rehearsed this - had practised these conversations enough times to know exactly which bits to leave out. But she hadn't trained her face enough. There were moments the wind would slap colour into her cheeks, and she'd glance off, and something hollow, fast and raw would flash behind her eyes. A tiredness far older than the years she'd lived; one I recognised from my bathroom mirror, in the early hours of the morning, as my parents argued a floor below, and I would wonder how bad it would get this time - powerless to stop it. Again and again.

She bore a look I'd known; a look I'd worn. A look I wasn't quite free from.

By the time we reached town, the sky had peeled itself back to a washed blue. I noticed more homes this time than on my entry - clean brick fronts with green or red doors. The road widened, curving between shopfronts, and whatever prior bitterness it had instilled in me was washed away by wonder; ugly knots in my chest were banished by another endless sea of words that spilt from the girl beside me, who made it her mission to lore-dump every detail that encompassed her delightful, festive home.

A grand cafe sat in a corner where the street dipped slightly, its windows fogged and decorated with painted snowflakes, catching the sunlight in little bursts of silver. 

""Best place to be,"" Lavender announced, as the murmur from inside grew warmer. A bell chimed as she pushed open the door, and a thick, sweet waft of coffee and sugar and baked treats swarmed me.

We drifted through the buzz and laughter to an alcoved window booth half-sunk into the wall, its padded seats wrapped in a cracked red vinyl, the table lined with jars of holly and little plates of delicate biscuits. Some berries lined the window shelf; a few had wilted into dark, crumpled dots. Lavender slid into the corner like she was reclaiming a throne, nudging aside a folded newspaper and a sugar jar.

""Welcome to my favourite corner on Earth."" She said, watching people drift past the window in soft focus as a gentle, obedient snowfall began. 

""Should I be honoured?"" I sank opposite, and the booth creaked.

""Deeply. I only share it with fellow carriers of baggage."" She said it like a joke, but there was an assessing glint in her eyes, a quick and measuring test of the waters. I'd earned it.

""My grandparents told you.""

She nodded.

""... Leo, I'm-""

A waitress brought over drinks without being asked, sliding in front of us a pair of steaming, hefty mugs filled with chocolate and marshmallows. 

""On your usual tab, Lav.""

""Ooo, you're a star, Ellie.""

""I know.""

Ellie moved away, and 'Lav' turned back to me, cupping her mug in both hands, the steam haloing her face and revealing a friendly, intent watching from her eyes.

""You come here a lot then,"" I said.

""Outstanding deduction, detective. Any others?"" 

""You got friends to bother?""

She gave a little shrug.

""Yeah, of course! But they have lives, normal ones. Here's better,"" she glanced around the cafe. ""People come in a bit worn. They sit, and they talk, or they rest, and then they leave looking... a little lighter.""

""Sounds nice to watch.""

One of her hands slid across the table and gently cupped mine.

""What're you-""

""How do you feel?"" She asked in the most delicate tone I believe a human could ever muster.

""Lavender, no offence, but-""

She cut me off again as something cold wormed under the warmth in my chest.

""He was a selfish prick, Leo; he treated you and your Mum like shit. Start with whatever hurts most. It's not an heirloom to be hoarded; it's rubbish - bin some of it here.""

I stared at my mug, bewildered by her words and the bluntness of how she said them. The cream was already collapsing, leaving brown islands of cocoa, and new drips crashed into the mounds, gently overflowing the drink.

Fuck, I was crying. I was crying, and she didn't even flinch. 

""I don't-""

""Yes, you do.""

It boiled out of me inexplicably, uncontrolled and ugly as I vented through heaving, quiet sobs. 

'What hurt most'

""Ugh, mum was out, so I hid bottles from him once... fuck, I-"" I wiped my eyes, ""-God, I just wanted it all to stop, if only for a night... and he just fucking *laughed* when he found out, like he was proud of me, like he thought it was cute, and he put his hand tight, like, really, really fucking tight on my shoulder and it just hurt so... so much. I hadn't... looked at him properly in months, and I didn't recognise who was looking down at me, and-"" she rubbed a gentle thumb over the back of my hand ""-he got paralytic that night... fucking, crawled on the floor in his underwear, I-"" I laughed a little at how truly absurd the memory was, ""-he passed out in a puddle of piss."" I laughed again. ""Fuck, he called me worthless, then said he loved me and then said I was a... fucking retard, or something and that I wasn't welcome in his house and screamed that he was going to kill me... and then he woke up the next morning like nothing fucking happened. Asking me what I wanted for dinner, like he wasn't going to do it all again in a few hours.""

Her eyes brightened, like I'd given her exactly what she wanted.

""When Mum told me he was gone, I... fuck, I thought that it was easier."" I hated the words as they left my tongue. ""Not better, just... simpler, I don't know. Like, there'd be no more waiting for the next shitshow, but-""

""That's enough,"" she said quietly. ""Feel better?""

I did, like I'd ripped a growing rot out from within, but then I shifted, suddenly needing her attention off of me.

""What about your dad, huh?"" I asked, regaining my composure, thankful that no patron noticed me devolve into a blubbering mess. ""You must have thoughts.""

She went still and took a deep breath.

""I'm counting down the days... waiting to see what gets him first: bottle, car, or stairs."" She gave a tiny, hideous laugh. ""And when it happens, I'll be relieved and hate myself for it.""

""That's..."" I started.

""Familiar?"" 

Of course, she understood. A happy, sad girl comforting a sadder boy, sharing a similar burden.

She watched me a precious beat longer, and I her, until she seemed to shake herself out of a trance.

""Right,"" she beamed, straightening up. ""I have a proposal.""

""Do you now?""

""Yes. We neck this-"" she lifted her mug ""-and ditch this therapy corner because I want to show you something.""

""And that would be... what?""

She nodded towards the window, where the gentle snow thickened into a pale blur.

""There's a bit of woods just past town. It's quiet. No lights, no carols, just trees and snow and an occasional squirrel and a dainty little spot where I go when the world feels a bit loud.""

""We can stay here, Lav.""

She raised her mug in a mock-toast.

""Leo, you look like you're about ten seconds away from smashing your head into this table. Trust me, we can sulk in better scenery.""

There was something in the way she said it - playful, coaxing and edged with purpose. Before I could think, she tipped her head back and drained her drink in one go, wincing when the heat hit her. I found it would be easier to follow her than argue, so I gulped down my thick, sickly sweet drink and followed her briskly out the door as she almost skipped away.

The town quickly thinned into fields, the fields into a scrabble of plump trees, and the footpath I imagined wasn't a path at all, more a trample into the snow by boots and paws and whatever else wandered out here. The air bit sharper the further we went, swallowing the town's sounds until all that remained was the creak of our steps and huff of our breath.

Conversation had slid back into mostly safer territory. She lectured me about her class life and the school she absolutely hated, but would miss; her hopes and dreams of becoming an actress and making it on her own... and the rumours that my grandparents' manor once, long ago, belonged to some lord whose wife went mad and threw herself from a balcony. I answered when I had to; joked when I could, and every now and then, she would flick her eyes back to me, checking I was still there and not on the verge of crumbling again. Not yet.

Finally, the trees broke into a clearing where a frozen lake lay; a perfect, dull mirror pressed into the earth. Snow had caked its surface, except where the wind had cleared thin, glassy veins, dark water shimmering below, surrounded by a ring of trodden shore where previous admirers had stood. 

Lavender took a long, tired breath, as if she'd been holding it the whole walk.

""See? Quiet.""

She led me to a fallen log buried in snow, brushed off a space with her glove, and plopped herself down. I sat beside her, the wood cold enough to sting through my clothes, as the lake creaked somewhere deep - a slow, pained groan like some giant turned over in its sleep.

A weight pressed on my ribs.

""Is this where you bring all your emotionally constipated boys after a cafe date?"" I asked.

""Just the special ones,"" she said. ""Don't get cocky."" She watched the lake, boot tapping a slow, nervous rhythm into the log. When she did look at me, the brightness had drained from her eyes, leaving something empty in its wake. ""Leo,"" she said. Just my name. No cute flair, no giggle tucked in.

My hands tightened around the log, threatening to snap the bark with a brittle crack.

""...yeah?""

She studied me, deciding which version of herself she'd lead with - the bouncy, sweet girl from the kitchen or the one from the booth who'd ripped me open with a handful of words. 

When she spoke, it came in a low, careful tone.

""When my dad's... being himself, I come here. Because if I don't, I'm going to take a kitchen knife and ram it into the back of his head.""

I gasped out a weak laugh.

""Ah, relatable.""

""Yeah."" Her eyes went to my crotch. ""I know what it's like to bottle things up.""

A shiver walked its way up my back as she shifted closer, our shoulders touching now, the smell of sugar and spice and flowers still wrapped around her.

""You're carrying so much of him. He's gone, but he's still... in there."" She tapped, very gently, two fingers over my chest. ""Everything he ever said. Every threat. Every time he scared you. And I bet he never said sorry.""

I swallowed hard.

""Yeah, well,"" I said hoarsely, as her other hand found my thigh. ""It's never going to just... go away.""

Her eyes exploded at that.

""No,"" she agreed, nodding. ""It doesn't. Not by itself.""

The lake popped again.

She took a delicate breath, and each word felt perfectly rehearsed. Not just in front of a mirror, or in the shower, but in far quieter, stranger places.

""I can help you. If you want.""

I tried to laugh her off. ""You already did. Café, remember?""

She shook her head.

""Talking helps, sure. But it doesn't burn the worst of it. That part sits in you; it hurts to even think about letting it go."" Her gaze flicked to the ice, her expression unreadable, and then she looked back to me, and I think I saw just how *old* she could've been. ""I can take it away.""

The question splattered on our laps, foul and awful.

""... what?""

""Your pain,"" she said, as if it were a mundane offer. ""The weight. I can take it, Leo.""

A blunt, stupid surge of anger flared up, quick and defensive, as I stood - much to her disapproval.

""Lav, that's not funny.""

""I'm not joking."" There was no smile anymore, not even a hint. ""You don't have to carry on. There'll be nights you can't sleep, you'll flinch when someone raises their voice, you'll wait by the door like he might stumble through it, even though you *know* he won't."" Her eye twitched; I think she'd stopped blinking, too. ""Let me take that from you. All of it. And you'll only remember the version of him you want.""

For a fleeting moment - one, sharp, traitorous moment - I imagined it.

I imagined a future where I didn't brace at slammed doors, or Intoxicated people didn't make me nervous, and I could evolve into a strong, young man that my Mum could be proud of. I imagined thinking of him and not being met with yellow eyes, or a hospital bed and a deteriorating man, or that crooked, sloppy grin he wore before he made a mess.

*Light*. The word floated around in my head, dizzy and... wrong. I could be light. Forever.

But then other pictures pushed in. Him hoisting me onto his shoulder, only a toddler, to watch a live show. His terrible, off-key singing he performed while sober, for there was, an age ago, a version of him that didn't drink. The night he cried when I thought I was asleep, thinking he'd broken my arm, whispering forgotten apologies in the dark; replaced with something pungent. 

It tangled together - the good, the monstrous, the pathetic, the pitiful... the hopeful. I couldn't sort it into piles, couldn't 'keep' and 'throw away'. It was him, all of it. The whole awful mess of him.

My dad.

*My* Dad!

""I-"" my voice came out scratchy. I cleared my throat as she watched me with unbearable patience. ""No, Lavender. That's... no.""

Her expression didn't waver as the lake creaked one final time, a long and low guttural moan of grief. She leaned back, resting her hands on her lap, and broke her eyes away from me and aimed them at the sky.

""I understand."" 

Her smile returned in degrees, too slow, reaching her mouth first, then her cheeks, but not quite reaching her eyes.

""...Lav?""

A minuscule, cracked laugh fell out of her as the wind stirred, lifting curls of her hair, but it was not just her locks anymore; fine, colourless threads traced from her head to the branches above, trapping light like crystal, and mapping patterns high in the trees that seemed invisible before. 

""You would've been perfect,"" there was a soft disappointment in her words. ""I would've... picked you clean, and you would've known only peace."" She uncurled some fingers, palm up, and something sticky lathered from them - a strand that slowly stretched into the air between us. Inside the humming thread, like flies in amber, twitched half-formed pictures: my dad on a carpet, a hospital bed, yellow eyes lost in yellow glass. I flinched back as the strand snapped with a crack, whipping away and vanishing into her sleeve. 

The woods exhaled, and all at once the sky above grew dim, as if a sheet of clouds had rolled over the sun, and the branches revealed a structure I hadn't understood in the light. 

Webbing. 

Not a veil, but a ceiling, strung from trunk to trunk in thick, glinting ropes; huge layers of silk sagged between the pines, and as the light shifted, they came alive. Images rippled across them like old film reels: strangers at a bedside, a boy in a smashed-up kitchen, a woman crying alone in a car.

Lavender rose.

The log screamed as if something far heavier than a girl had left it. Her coat bulged and split and then peeled away like shed skin, and what uncoiled from within were enormous, pale, jointed limbs unfolding with a slow, mortifying grace, each leg longer than I was tall. Her torso stretched and thinned, and a swollen white abdomen swayed up from behind her, veined with faint colours and laced with moving shadows. Her small, familiar face rode at the front of the mass, dragging up with it - eyes now faceted, multiplying me into a dozen tiny figures. 

Above, one of the larger webs sparked to life. Not a stranger, but my grandparents in their old cottage. They were younger, much younger, faces raw from crying. Grandad held something wrapped in a blanket that was far, far too small - a dead bundle they rended their faces from.

""They gave me that one."" Lavender's voice came from her huge, arachnid body - layered, echoed... ancient. She loomed between the trees, more a white shadow than a shape. ""So your mother could be their only."" Her massive limbs flexed, testing their reach, and the web-screens shivered with a thousand captured griefs. But her eyes were fixed only on me... starving. ""You could have been happy, Leo. But you chose to keep him. You will carry that alone, *always.*""

My heart felt like it would burst, staring up at a memory of an aunt I never knew had been born, and at the vast white spider that still wore a girl's smile.

Another sheet stirred, tinted in a pale violet. The scene was faint and grainy, the room choked with old furniture; a squat television with dials hunched in a corner, and a man staggered across the room, shouting at someone. He kicks a coffee table, sending ash and cards flying into the air.

Then she steps in, exhausted and empty inside.

She's younger as well - not by a year or two, but by an era. Her hair is tied back with a ribbon, her dress hem brushes her knees, but her eyes are the same colour. She hides a knife behind her back and then lunges for his head before he can turn around. Snow drifts in through a cracked window, scribbling white along the floor; she is on his back, stabbing until he goes still as snowflakes catch in her hair and litter her face. 

The silk pulsed once, and the image faded.

""My first,"" the spider said, almost fondly. It crooned above me, shifting, its eyes twinkling down from an impossible height. ""She awoke me that night; showed me what could be taken."" A blob of saliva dropped from its mouth, melting the snow beside me, as it opened a maw of ravenous teeth. ""Fret not... you'll see her again soon.""

The spider began to descend. 

One long, pale leg settled silently, merely a step from my boot.

Another limb followed.

Something moved at the edges of the trees. A shape slipped between the trunks, almost colourless against the snow - manifesting as a tall man in a white coat, a great grey dog at his heel. They didn't crash through the undergrowth to my rescue; they were just suddenly,,, there, as if they had been the entire time.

""That's enough."" The Gardener's voice was quiet, but it cut deep across the humming web like a bullet, and through the earth.

The spider froze a breath away from my shoulder. It hesitated, afraid, all those faceted eyes swivelled, fixing not on me, but on him. The dog growled, a low warning that seemed to run down the trees and into the roots.

""He said no,"" the Gardener added, standing just beyond the ring of trees, one hand resting lightly on his dog's neck. Not a lick of fear touched him, no surprise at the looming thing towering over us, only the sternness of a man who knew the rules. ""You don't take what isn't given.""

The spider twitched, a ripple ran through its veins, and I glimpsed Lavender's sulking face. 

""He is drowning!"" It spat. ""One strand and he could breathe again! Is that not why he's here?!"" The webs above vibrated with frustration, their images shivering, stuttering, and buffering.

""He was here to choose, not feed you."" He stepped forward, just once, and the spider recoiled. The dog padded beside him, ears raised, its eyes locked on the nearest limb. ""You have your winter; you've eaten well."" His gaze finally met me. ""But this one goes home.""

The great white legs spasmed and snapped up, whipping snow into the air, as it drew itself far back into a high dark, folding her bulk between the trunks.

""You're soft,"" it hissed, thwarted.

The man tutted, waving his hand. ""Back to your work. There'll be others.""

A tremor ran through the webs - irritation, or laughter, or both. On the nearest web, a familiar snow-dusted girl looked up from her kill with violet eyes, smiling at me across all that distance. Then the image dulled, flatlining into nothing.

""Come, boy,"" said the Gardener, turning as his dog fell into step, and headed back towards the path leading to town. ""Your mother's here. Best not keep her waiting.""

I looked once more into the trees, at ghostly webs dissolving into branches, and the fathomless dark hiding a girl-shaped monster. Then I forced my legs to move, crunching after a man and his silent hound, at a complete loss for words.

Mum was pink-cheeked from the cold and utterly blown away by her parents' new home. She spotted me first and crushed me into a hug that stole my breath, fingers digging into my back. She bombarded me with a million questions; my answers were tired and brief, but it warmed me to see that her smile wasn't patched together for once.

Nan moaned about her coat being too small; Grandad poured her something strong and pretended not to be surprised when she chugged it. We ended up in the kitchen, absent its little baker. Mum perched on a stool with a forgotten tea, laughing at one of Nan's awful jokes, and I watched the corners of her mouth soften, and the endless brace in her shoulders slack slightly. Her hand found my knee under the table and rested there, a simple gesture that said far more than any apology neither of us had tried.

She met Lavender later that afternoon. Just a girl in a greased apron, helping Nan prep the roast, pressing a warm parsnip into her hand.

""You must be Leo's Mum!"" She beamed. ""Boy, I tell you - your son has been a delight!"" 

Mum grew flustered at that, a kind of pleased embarrassment she hadn't been allowed to feel in years. Lavender laughed at her jokes, eyes bright; just a neighbour's girl who knew how to fit in, and I tried not to throw up in my mouth.

Dinner came, and Mum leaned over to me, voice low and warm with wine she could actually enjoy. 

""I think that girl likes you."" A gentle, tipsy, incredulous smile tugged at her mouth. ""And, you know... I think this might be a Christmas to remember.""

I nodded, swallowing down the knot in my throat, and squeezed her hand. Outside, the snow did not cease, and somewhere beyond the windows a garden slept. 

""You have no idea,"" I said, trying my hardest to ignore the pair of kind, violet eyes that could never seem to look away, watching my mother with a hopeful, eternally famished hunger. 

I could only hope that if she hung her grief in the trees... I would recognise the woman who came back.",1,1766492705.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

The puppy from the box will lose its novelty, and grow big and stink - maybe make a mess on the floor once in a while. The decorations return to the attic and gather another year's worth of dust, assuming they remain in the same home at all. 

Extended families go back to their lives after a meal; presents become rubbish to be tidied. 

Normalcy resumes.

And the snow, however many blankets thick, will always melt as the first warm days of spring usher in.

Growing up, Christmas always came in twos. There was the one at home, with Mum and Dad, who remedied his jolly spirit with bottles - a day that stretched far too thin over alcohol clinks and small smiles. Something at dinner would go wrong, or someone’s gratitude for a gift would be 'underwhelming', and a voice would inevitably shout, another festive argument, and something always, *always* broke amidst intoxicated splendour. I would start to dread the day that tree emerged in our living room; fewer and fewer boxes under it every year. 

The second would be with my grandparents in their softer home, with their finer plates and my grandmother's fussing over second helpings - a happy few days of play-pretend, like I didn't know what was happening to the man who raised me. 

It soon became apparent that some things weren't being packed away with the tinsel, long after Christmas was over.

When I was old enough to understand words like 'cirrhosis’, the damage was already written in the yellowing of his eyes, as the holiday smell of alcohol had stuck to him for years aplenty. The final time I saw him on his feet was under the glow of the market tree lights, sweating and shivering, insisting via slurred jokes that he was fine while Mum pleaded with him to go to the hospital. 

""You need help, Darius. This has to stop.""

She'd refused to take him; refused to help him unless he wanted it, and begrudgingly settled for watching the man who gently placed a ring on her finger and danced their honeymoon away on tropical isles, drink himself to death.

Last Christmas Eve, he passed.

His liver, obviously. His body had finally done what the rest of us had been too afraid to do and simply refused to carry him any further. The house was quiet when the call came, the snow outside lying still and innocent, announcing that he'd run out of time.

Our home was mute; we'd used all our tears on him long ago, no more sympathy to muster. 

No more pain - for us, and for him.

It felt wrong without his blaring presence; the absence became a far heavier weight on our shoulders. Mum drifted around the house as if the floor might give out beneath her, gathering his untouched mugs and glasses, straightening the cushions he hadn't disturbed in weeks. At one point, she found his Santa hat from the folds of the couch, her fingers running smoothly over the cheap red cotton... and then she put it back exactly where she found it.

Grief didn't come in sobs and wails and talk, not for us. There was nothing to say that we hadn't already screamed at him: arguments, begs, threats, promises. No, it came in the sound of a humming fridge and a ticking clock and a creaking house fighting to stay warm.

I sat on my bed for most of the day, waiting for unsteady steps up the stairs or a wet cough that rattled the halls; for him to sway in the doorway, stinking, asking his champ if he wanted anything. But the space remained empty. When I did finally lie down, I stared at the ceiling and tried to picture his face - truly remember it, before his skin sallowed and dyed an ugly yellow. It kept slipping away, replaced with never enough hospital visits or the words we couldn't take back. 

So much left unsaid. 

I expected tears, some great shuddering release now that it was finally over, but instead I felt a tight, numb chest - my body choosing to feel nothing at all instead of untangling.

Sleep came in thin, broken pieces.

The next morning, I took the long, quiet bus ride to my grandparents' new house - my coat carrying the fleeting smell of our hush home. 

They'd moved a few months prior, trading a cosy cottage for a grand manor at the edge of a new town. Mum said it was a 'business opportunity' and that 'they deserved to retire somewhere nicer.' 

She didn't know the real reason they'd moved; I never asked.

The journey out felt different from the usual grey crawl of the city. Tall buildings and underpasses became soft hills and neat rows of trees, their bare branches laced with frost; fields lay out in clean, white sheets, and villages came and went, arranged for a catalogue, their wreath-clad cottages spitting out kids dragging sledges, laughing like life had never hurt them. 

Then I reached my stop, and I stepped into a movie.

The town was curated. Perfect, picturesque buildings; shop windows framed with garlands and little lights - gingerbread homes, toy trains - handwritten signs taped to the glass, handmade ornaments below, overhead street lights of stars and snowflakes. People sat inside cafes, cupping steaming mugs, faces flushed from anything but vexing arguments. I watched a family jostle each other outside a bakery, bags of pastries in hand, their breath clouding the air. 

The father wrapped a stern arm around his oldest son, laughing at a joke.

The bitterness rose quickly and sharply.

Of course, this was where I'd spend my day - a postcard-worthy town where the worst Christmas disaster is a dropped pudding. A town that received bad news slowly, if at all, and where someone like my Dad would enact his scenes safely out of frame - no one else aware if he died a night prior, a bus ride away, his liver shot to utter shit.

Another knot began to bundle in my chest.

My grandparents' new home sat just beyond the last cluster of houses, set back from the road behind a stone wall and a pair of iron gates painted cheerful green. The estate itself was old, with tall windows and steep, sloping roofs, but there was nothing harsh about its demeanour. Even the ivy climbed the stone in tidy ribbons, and smoke curled from the chimney in thin, friendly lines.

They had not held back on the decorations.

An utter vomit of light traced every window and balcony, glowing red, green and gold in the grim daylight. A pungent pine wreath hung on the door, dotted with red berries and a thick bow; a little nativity set and a pair of birch reindeer sat in the front garden, dusted with snow - a happy house, genuinely proud to be dressed up for the holidays.

It was almost too calm, too gentle. 

Mum hadn't accompanied me. Said she needed to stay behind to deal with... things. She'd moved more slowly that morning, like each step ached, before kissing my head at the bus station and telling me that I was safe with her folks. That being here, for however long, would do me good. And as I pushed open the gate and walked up the path lined with lanterns, I tried my damndest to believe her; that, maybe this year, Christmas could be as advertised. 

But in that moment, I felt more like an unwelcome package - a lad attending a pantomime in funeral clothes.

And that Christmas... would be unlike anything I'd ever known.

\-

The door swung open before I could knock.

My grandparents stood together, almost attached, framed by the hallway light. Nan's eyes were already red-rimmed, but she forced her mouth into some kind of smile; Grandad's hand hovered awkwardly at my shoulder, unable to decide between a pat or an embrace.

""Come in, dearie. You'll freeze out there."" Nan said quickly, stepping aside. 

They ushered me in with a rehearsed gentleness, careful not to mention his name; careful not to ask how I was. Their questions came in soft, practical murmurs: ""Did I sleep on the bus?"" Was I hungry?... all padding around the gloom that followed me inside, as if I were a skittish animal they might scare off. 

Warmth hit me in the face: the smell of baking dough, the low hiss of a radiator, some old song playing from another room. My coat was shrugged off my shoulders, my bag taken with a ""We'll stick this in your room for now,"" as I was manoeuvred down a polished hallway. 

""Nothing heavy today,"" Grandad said. ""Just a nice, quiet Christmas, yeah?""

I nodded.

That was when I first saw him.

At the end of a corridor was a door leading to a garden. A man stood amidst the thicket - dressed entirely in white. A thick woollen coat, pale trousers, gloves the shade of paper, even his hair, cut close to his skull, was almost colourless. 

Beside him sat a giant dog, all sharp muscle and thin grey fur, its shoulders level with the man's hip. Its eyes flicked to me: pale, yellow, assessing.

""Ah,"" Grandad said, following my gaze. ""You've seen our gardener.""

The man's eyes slowly found mine, and he politely bowed his head. His face was remarkably forgettable - his features too even, as if someone had drawn it from memory and left out the little human flaws of complexion. There was no dirt on his clothes, no mud on his boots, no trace of the cold in his cheeks despite the snow clinging to his dog's fur.

Nan's hand tightened briefly on my shoulder.

""You'll see him about,"" She said hastily. ""He keeps the grounds in order.""

The dog gave a low huff and nudged the man's hand. He rested gloved fingers between its ears, whispering something inaudible. 

""Come on, Leo,"" Grandad said brightly. ""Let's get you some cocoa.""

No name. No introduction. No mention of where he'd come from, or how long he'd worked here. And yet... his presence was an inescapable tug. A silent insistence somewhere in my head urged me to step away from my grandparents, walk down the hall, and hide within his garden.

But they steered me away, away from the corridor and the man who stood beyond its end until a corner cut him from view. He rarely moved; his dog did not - watching me go with pricked ears and unblinking eyes. 

And he was only the first of two strangers in that house.

I heard her before I saw her: a girl's voice humming a carol amidst the soft clatter of pans, bowls and the soft thud of wood hitting dough. I expected a maid, bustling and muttering about timings, but when we stepped into the kitchen, my eyes fell upon a girl my age - sleeves rolled and cheeks flushed, flour freckling her forearms. She was unsoundly pretty: her violet eyes too bright, her smile too ready, every movement deliberate as she pressed a cutter into a sheet of gingerbread, readying another platoon of men for their march into the oven; moving through the room as if she'd been born into it, reaching for jars and utensils from the right drawers and cupboards without even looking.

""Morning!"" She beamed, regarding us like we were customers.

My grandparents weren’t startled at the sight of her. No double-take, no fussed apology about not hearing her come in. Nan angled around the girl to the kettle, sidestepping a sprinkle of flour at her feet as if she'd done it a hundred times.

""You're going to spoil us rotten, girl."" She said with a grin, heaving spoonfuls of chocolate powder into mugs.

""Someone has to."" The girl said, as she looked at me, and her smile widened from ear to ear. ""Oh, you must be Leo! They've told me so much about you!""

""Aw, that's nice-who're you?""

Grandad's hand stayed firm on my shoulder. ""Lavender,"" he said with such pleasantry, ""neighbour's girl; helps out-""

""-and we'd be lost without her."" Nan cut in, her voice almost mute within the fizz of a kettle. ""I take it your *dad*\-"" the word carefully left her mouth, trying to keep it civil ""-isn't home?""

""Pff, is he ever.""

For just a moment, in the reflection of the oven's door, her face emptied of all cheerful demeanour. Not sad, or angry, just... blank. The door opened, and a wave of heat rolled across the room as she turned a tray of baking gingerbread, and then shut it with a bump of her thigh. And her smile returned - a light slotted back into place.

""Sit, lad,"" Grandad said, pulling out a chair, promising a drink, assuring me that the cheerful, helpful young lady who found herself in their home most days was the most fabulous baker in town. Up close, she smelled of sugar and spice and flowers, earning her namesake; little crescents of dough clung under her nails as she lifted a final cut-out from the board, a tiny frown pinched between her brow - gone in a flash, smoothed over by a sunny, over-eager grin I'd already decided didn't fit her. She accepted their fussing and praise with a dip of her head, a bright, gleeful sound in the back of her throat, her fingers finally satisfied with the work they'd made along one more tray. 

I understood the quiet drag underneath her brightness; the unsung gravity that orbited her. I felt it myself in classes, at gatherings with friends, at work, places where I stood too comfortably playing make-believe, scrounging up every trick I knew to not think about what once waited for me at home.

""You like gingerbread, right?"" She asked me from across the counter, almost panicked, offering me one of her fresher-baked soldiers from a bowl. The light above her burned steadily and warmly, glowing her face like a lost star. 

For the first time since my arrival, I smiled. ""I love it.""

And for the first time in the several minutes I'd known her, she smiled, *really* smiled, as I broke off my first piece.

It was delicious.

We had a whole day to kill, but every hour spent in that kitchen felt like an age built on borrowed joy.

Lavender soon decided that we were going out. It wasn't a question; it was an announcement made over sweeping crumbs and dishes to be washed. One moment, I was at the table with a mug in my hands; the next, I was being handed back my coat and told to put my boots on.

""You look comfortable,"" Lavender teased with a wink.

The cold was a sharp, clean steal of our breath as we stepped outside, waved on and off by my awestruck, giddy grandparents. Lavender tapped her boots, adjusted her scarf, patted down her puffer coat - the same colour as her eyes - before leading me along the crunching path that had carved my arrival. Lanterns remained on guard, their small flames bending when the wind shifted, swaying light across the snow.

The afternoon looked a little less grey.

We were halfway down the path when I saw him again, standing far off to the side, behind a little fence, where trimmed hedges gave way to bare-branched shrubs. His clothes were the same stark white as before; the dog still pressed against his leg, its fur stippled with a thin, ashen frost. He wasn't close enough to greet, nor far enough to ignore. Merely... placed, in that perfect length of distance that made me question whether we'd interrupted him or walked into his vision on purpose.

Lavender's stride stuttered before she angled her body towards me and forced my attention back to the front gate. ""Ugh."" She groaned, a bit too loudly. ""Y'know, your Grandad is very relieved to have a man for the grounds, but you think he could've chosen someone... a bit more normal.""

""Does he live here?"" I asked.

Her mouth tugged, almost a smirk, nearly a flinch.

""Sort of. He's always just... around.""

She never once looked at him, not directly. Her gaze skimmed over him, pretending not to see him, as her jaw tightened - a small muscle in her cheek flickering. The dog's eyes tracked us as we neared the gate, unblinking. Its owner didn't say anything or move, save for a slow, lazy tilt of his head, as if he were testing the wind.

I tried not to stare. I failed.

Lavender bumped my arm.

""Don't let him weird you out. He's harmless,"" she said, her hand reaching for the gate latch.

""Does he have a name?""

""Everyone does. Doesn't mean you need to know it.""

Before I could ask what in the hell that was supposed to mean, she swung open the gate and bound out onto the lane, her boots thumping into packed snow; she twirled, walking back a few paces, smile flaring back to full strength.

""Come on. Town won't admire itself.""

A gentle, decisive wind pushed at my back, preventing me from sneaking a last look at the silent pair likely still watching from their ordered shrubs, and nudged me onto the fluffy lane. I slipped and landed face-first into the snow. Lavender laughed, an impossibly joyful sound, and helped me to my feet as the latch clicked shut behind us. I fell into step beside her as she began her walk... and she looped an arm through mine as if it were the easiest thing in her life.

I did not object.

""Wait until you see the main cafe - you wouldn't have spotted it on the bus,"" her voice bounced down the still road. ""They do these *thicc* hot chocolates that will absolutely ruin your teeth.""

""As good as your gingerbread?""

She giggled, and I let her talk, letting the promise of sugared windows and a warm booth pull my attention on as the manor shrank away, and the hedges dropped into white fields, and the looming sense of eyes burning holes in the back of my head withered away with the cold. She rambled enough for both of us on the walk down, but there were meticulous gaps in her words; never giving too much of herself away, or prying into my personal life either. She told me which house puts its lights up too early every year, which shopkeeper slips extra chocolates to kids who know how to say please, and which old postman insists on sending cards over email. She told me about the winter fair they'd had in the square a few weeks back, about the jazz band that played despite their numb fingers, and the poor Santa whose beard kept slipping down. 

Her voice was paint, colouring the road ahead.

But whenever my questions strayed too close to her, she stepped around them like a patch of black ice.

""Do you live nearby?""

""Yeah, close enough,"" she tipped her head towards a hill of houses. ""Takes no time to reach your grandparents - they are *much* nicer than the last couple who lived there.""

""Siblings?""

""Huh? Me? No, just... me and the old man,"" she answered far too quickly. ""All the attention, all the disappointment, aha.""

""... does he know where you are?""

""Oh yeah - usually. He's just so, so busy with work, y'know.""

She'd rehearsed this - had practised these conversations enough times to know exactly which bits to leave out. But she hadn't trained her face enough. There were moments the wind would slap colour into her cheeks, and she'd glance off, and something hollow, fast and raw would flash behind her eyes. A tiredness far older than the years she'd lived; one I recognised from my bathroom mirror, in the early hours of the morning, as my parents argued a floor below, and I would wonder how bad it would get this time - powerless to stop it. Again and again.

She bore a look I'd known; a look I'd worn. A look I wasn't quite free from.

By the time we reached town, the sky had peeled itself back to a washed blue. I noticed more homes this time than on my entry - clean brick fronts with green or red doors. The road widened, curving between shopfronts, and whatever prior bitterness it had instilled in me was washed away by wonder; ugly knots in my chest were banished by another endless sea of words that spilt from the girl beside me, who made it her mission to lore-dump every detail that encompassed her delightful, festive home.

A grand cafe sat in a corner where the street dipped slightly, its windows fogged and decorated with painted snowflakes, catching the sunlight in little bursts of silver. 

""Best place to be,"" Lavender announced, as the murmur from inside grew warmer. A bell chimed as she pushed open the door, and a thick, sweet waft of coffee and sugar and baked treats swarmed me.

We drifted through the buzz and laughter to an alcoved window booth half-sunk into the wall, its padded seats wrapped in a cracked red vinyl, the table lined with jars of holly and little plates of delicate biscuits. Some berries lined the window shelf; a few had wilted into dark, crumpled dots. Lavender slid into the corner like she was reclaiming a throne, nudging aside a folded newspaper and a sugar jar.

""Welcome to my favourite corner on Earth."" She said, watching people drift past the window in soft focus as a gentle, obedient snowfall began. 

""Should I be honoured?"" I sank opposite, and the booth creaked.

""Deeply. I only share it with fellow carriers of baggage."" She said it like a joke, but there was an assessing glint in her eyes, a quick and measuring test of the waters. I'd earned it.

""My grandparents told you.""

She nodded.

""... Leo, I'm-""

A waitress brought over drinks without being asked, sliding in front of us a pair of steaming, hefty mugs filled with chocolate and marshmallows. 

""On your usual tab, Lav.""

""Ooo, you're a star, Ellie.""

""I know.""

Ellie moved away, and 'Lav' turned back to me, cupping her mug in both hands, the steam haloing her face and revealing a friendly, intent watching from her eyes.

""You come here a lot then,"" I said.

""Outstanding deduction, detective. Any others?"" 

""You got friends to bother?""

She gave a little shrug.

""Yeah, of course! But they have lives, normal ones. Here's better,"" she glanced around the cafe. ""People come in a bit worn. They sit, and they talk, or they rest, and then they leave looking... a little lighter.""

""Sounds nice to watch.""

One of her hands slid across the table and gently cupped mine.

""What're you-""

""How do you feel?"" She asked in the most delicate tone I believe a human could ever muster.

""Lavender, no offence, but-""

She cut me off again as something cold wormed under the warmth in my chest.

""He was a selfish prick, Leo; he treated you and your Mum like shit. Start with whatever hurts most. It's not an heirloom to be hoarded; it's rubbish - bin some of it here.""

I stared at my mug, bewildered by her words and the bluntness of how she said them. The cream was already collapsing, leaving brown islands of cocoa, and new drips crashed into the mounds, gently overflowing the drink.

Fuck, I was crying. I was crying, and she didn't even flinch. 

""I don't-""

""Yes, you do.""

It boiled out of me inexplicably, uncontrolled and ugly as I vented through heaving, quiet sobs. 

'What hurt most'

""Ugh, mum was out, so I hid bottles from him once... fuck, I-"" I wiped my eyes, ""-God, I just wanted it all to stop, if only for a night... and he just fucking *laughed* when he found out, like he was proud of me, like he thought it was cute, and he put his hand tight, like, really, really fucking tight on my shoulder and it just hurt so... so much. I hadn't... looked at him properly in months, and I didn't recognise who was looking down at me, and-"" she rubbed a gentle thumb over the back of my hand ""-he got paralytic that night... fucking, crawled on the floor in his underwear, I-"" I laughed a little at how truly absurd the memory was, ""-he passed out in a puddle of piss."" I laughed again. ""Fuck, he called me worthless, then said he loved me and then said I was a... fucking retard, or something and that I wasn't welcome in his house and screamed that he was going to kill me... and then he woke up the next morning like nothing fucking happened. Asking me what I wanted for dinner, like he wasn't going to do it all again in a few hours.""

Her eyes brightened, like I'd given her exactly what she wanted.

""When Mum told me he was gone, I... fuck, I thought that it was easier."" I hated the words as they left my tongue. ""Not better, just... simpler, I don't know. Like, there'd be no more waiting for the next shitshow, but-""

""That's enough,"" she said quietly. ""Feel better?""

I did, like I'd ripped a growing rot out from within, but then I shifted, suddenly needing her attention off of me.

""What about your dad, huh?"" I asked, regaining my composure, thankful that no patron noticed me devolve into a blubbering mess. ""You must have thoughts.""

She went still and took a deep breath.

""I'm counting down the days... waiting to see what gets him first: bottle, car, or stairs."" She gave a tiny, hideous laugh. ""And when it happens, I'll be relieved and hate myself for it.""

""That's..."" I started.

""Familiar?"" 

Of course, she understood. A happy, sad girl comforting a sadder boy, sharing a similar burden.

She watched me a precious beat longer, and I her, until she seemed to shake herself out of a trance.

""Right,"" she beamed, straightening up. ""I have a proposal.""

""Do you now?""

""Yes. We neck this-"" she lifted her mug ""-and ditch this therapy corner because I want to show you something.""

""And that would be... what?""

She nodded towards the window, where the gentle snow thickened into a pale blur.

""There's a bit of woods just past town. It's quiet. No lights, no carols, just trees and snow and an occasional squirrel and a dainty little spot where I go when the world feels a bit loud.""

""We can stay here, Lav.""

She raised her mug in a mock-toast.

""Leo, you look like you're about ten seconds away from smashing your head into this table. Trust me, we can sulk in better scenery.""

There was something in the way she said it - playful, coaxing and edged with purpose. Before I could think, she tipped her head back and drained her drink in one go, wincing when the heat hit her. I found it would be easier to follow her than argue, so I gulped down my thick, sickly sweet drink and followed her briskly out the door as she almost skipped away.

The town quickly thinned into fields, the fields into a scrabble of plump trees, and the footpath I imagined wasn't a path at all, more a trample into the snow by boots and paws and whatever else wandered out here. The air bit sharper the further we went, swallowing the town's sounds until all that remained was the creak of our steps and huff of our breath.

Conversation had slid back into mostly safer territory. She lectured me about her class life and the school she absolutely hated, but would miss; her hopes and dreams of becoming an actress and making it on her own... and the rumours that my grandparents' manor once, long ago, belonged to some lord whose wife went mad and threw herself from a balcony. I answered when I had to; joked when I could, and every now and then, she would flick her eyes back to me, checking I was still there and not on the verge of crumbling again. Not yet.

Finally, the trees broke into a clearing where a frozen lake lay; a perfect, dull mirror pressed into the earth. Snow had caked its surface, except where the wind had cleared thin, glassy veins, dark water shimmering below, surrounded by a ring of trodden shore where previous admirers had stood. 

Lavender took a long, tired breath, as if she'd been holding it the whole walk.

""See? Quiet.""

She led me to a fallen log buried in snow, brushed off a space with her glove, and plopped herself down. I sat beside her, the wood cold enough to sting through my clothes, as the lake creaked somewhere deep - a slow, pained groan like some giant turned over in its sleep.

A weight pressed on my ribs.

""Is this where you bring all your emotionally constipated boys after a cafe date?"" I asked.

""Just the special ones,"" she said. ""Don't get cocky."" She watched the lake, boot tapping a slow, nervous rhythm into the log. When she did look at me, the brightness had drained from her eyes, leaving something empty in its wake. ""Leo,"" she said. Just my name. No cute flair, no giggle tucked in.

My hands tightened around the log, threatening to snap the bark with a brittle crack.

""...yeah?""

She studied me, deciding which version of herself she'd lead with - the bouncy, sweet girl from the kitchen or the one from the booth who'd ripped me open with a handful of words. 

When she spoke, it came in a low, careful tone.

""When my dad's... being himself, I come here. Because if I don't, I'm going to take a kitchen knife and ram it into the back of his head.""

I gasped out a weak laugh.

""Ah, relatable.""

""Yeah."" Her eyes went to my crotch. ""I know what it's like to bottle things up.""

A shiver walked its way up my back as she shifted closer, our shoulders touching now, the smell of sugar and spice and flowers still wrapped around her.

""You're carrying so much of him. He's gone, but he's still... in there."" She tapped, very gently, two fingers over my chest. ""Everything he ever said. Every threat. Every time he scared you. And I bet he never said sorry.""

I swallowed hard.

""Yeah, well,"" I said hoarsely, as her other hand found my thigh. ""It's never going to just... go away.""

Her eyes exploded at that.

""No,"" she agreed, nodding. ""It doesn't. Not by itself.""

The lake popped again.

She took a delicate breath, and each word felt perfectly rehearsed. Not just in front of a mirror, or in the shower, but in far quieter, stranger places.

""I can help you. If you want.""

I tried to laugh her off. ""You already did. Café, remember?""

She shook her head.

""Talking helps, sure. But it doesn't burn the worst of it. That part sits in you; it hurts to even think about letting it go."" Her gaze flicked to the ice, her expression unreadable, and then she looked back to me, and I think I saw just how *old* she could've been. ""I can take it away.""

The question splattered on our laps, foul and awful.

""... what?""

""Your pain,"" she said, as if it were a mundane offer. ""The weight. I can take it, Leo.""

A blunt, stupid surge of anger flared up, quick and defensive, as I stood - much to her disapproval.

""Lav, that's not funny.""

""I'm not joking."" There was no smile anymore, not even a hint. ""You don't have to carry on. There'll be nights you can't sleep, you'll flinch when someone raises their voice, you'll wait by the door like he might stumble through it, even though you *know* he won't."" Her eye twitched; I think she'd stopped blinking, too. ""Let me take that from you. All of it. And you'll only remember the version of him you want.""

For a fleeting moment - one, sharp, traitorous moment - I imagined it.

I imagined a future where I didn't brace at slammed doors, or Intoxicated people didn't make me nervous, and I could evolve into a strong, young man that my Mum could be proud of. I imagined thinking of him and not being met with yellow eyes, or a hospital bed and a deteriorating man, or that crooked, sloppy grin he wore before he made a mess.

*Light*. The word floated around in my head, dizzy and... wrong. I could be light. Forever.

But then other pictures pushed in. Him hoisting me onto his shoulder, only a toddler, to watch a live show. His terrible, off-key singing he performed while sober, for there was, an age ago, a version of him that didn't drink. The night he cried when I thought I was asleep, thinking he'd broken my arm, whispering forgotten apologies in the dark; replaced with something pungent. 

It tangled together - the good, the monstrous, the pathetic, the pitiful... the hopeful. I couldn't sort it into piles, couldn't 'keep' and 'throw away'. It was him, all of it. The whole awful mess of him.

My dad.

*My* Dad!

""I-"" my voice came out scratchy. I cleared my throat as she watched me with unbearable patience. ""No, Lavender. That's... no.""

Her expression didn't waver as the lake creaked one final time, a long and low guttural moan of grief. She leaned back, resting her hands on her lap, and broke her eyes away from me and aimed them at the sky.

""I understand."" 

Her smile returned in degrees, too slow, reaching her mouth first, then her cheeks, but not quite reaching her eyes.

""...Lav?""

A minuscule, cracked laugh fell out of her as the wind stirred, lifting curls of her hair, but it was not just her locks anymore; fine, colourless threads traced from her head to the branches above, trapping light like crystal, and mapping patterns high in the trees that seemed invisible before. 

""You would've been perfect,"" there was a soft disappointment in her words. ""I would've... picked you clean, and you would've known only peace."" She uncurled some fingers, palm up, and something sticky lathered from them - a strand that slowly stretched into the air between us. Inside the humming thread, like flies in amber, twitched half-formed pictures: my dad on a carpet, a hospital bed, yellow eyes lost in yellow glass. I flinched back as the strand snapped with a crack, whipping away and vanishing into her sleeve. 

The woods exhaled, and all at once the sky above grew dim, as if a sheet of clouds had rolled over the sun, and the branches revealed a structure I hadn't understood in the light. 

Webbing. 

Not a veil, but a ceiling, strung from trunk to trunk in thick, glinting ropes; huge layers of silk sagged between the pines, and as the light shifted, they came alive. Images rippled across them like old film reels: strangers at a bedside, a boy in a smashed-up kitchen, a woman crying alone in a car.

Lavender rose.

The log screamed as if something far heavier than a girl had left it. Her coat bulged and split and then peeled away like shed skin, and what uncoiled from within were enormous, pale, jointed limbs unfolding with a slow, mortifying grace, each leg longer than I was tall. Her torso stretched and thinned, and a swollen white abdomen swayed up from behind her, veined with faint colours and laced with moving shadows. Her small, familiar face rode at the front of the mass, dragging up with it - eyes now faceted, multiplying me into a dozen tiny figures. 

Above, one of the larger webs sparked to life. Not a stranger, but my grandparents in their old cottage. They were younger, much younger, faces raw from crying. Grandad held something wrapped in a blanket that was far, far too small - a dead bundle they rended their faces from.

""They gave me that one."" Lavender's voice came from her huge, arachnid body - layered, echoed... ancient. She loomed between the trees, more a white shadow than a shape. ""So your mother could be their only."" Her massive limbs flexed, testing their reach, and the web-screens shivered with a thousand captured griefs. But her eyes were fixed only on me... starving. ""You could have been happy, Leo. But you chose to keep him. You will carry that alone, *always.*""

My heart felt like it would burst, staring up at a memory of an aunt I never knew had been born, and at the vast white spider that still wore a girl's smile.

Another sheet stirred, tinted in a pale violet. The scene was faint and grainy, the room choked with old furniture; a squat television with dials hunched in a corner, and a man staggered across the room, shouting at someone. He kicks a coffee table, sending ash and cards flying into the air.

Then she steps in, exhausted and empty inside.

She's younger as well - not by a year or two, but by an era. Her hair is tied back with a ribbon, her dress hem brushes her knees, but her eyes are the same colour. She hides a knife behind her back and then lunges for his head before he can turn around. Snow drifts in through a cracked window, scribbling white along the floor; she is on his back, stabbing until he goes still as snowflakes catch in her hair and litter her face. 

The silk pulsed once, and the image faded.

""My first,"" the spider said, almost fondly. It crooned above me, shifting, its eyes twinkling down from an impossible height. ""She awoke me that night; showed me what could be taken."" A blob of saliva dropped from its mouth, melting the snow beside me, as it opened a maw of ravenous teeth. ""Fret not... you'll see her again soon.""

The spider began to descend. 

One long, pale leg settled silently, merely a step from my boot.

Another limb followed.

Something moved at the edges of the trees. A shape slipped between the trunks, almost colourless against the snow - manifesting as a tall man in a white coat, a great grey dog at his heel. They didn't crash through the undergrowth to my rescue; they were just suddenly,,, there, as if they had been the entire time.

""That's enough."" The Gardener's voice was quiet, but it cut deep across the humming web like a bullet, and through the earth.

The spider froze a breath away from my shoulder. It hesitated, afraid, all those faceted eyes swivelled, fixing not on me, but on him. The dog growled, a low warning that seemed to run down the trees and into the roots.

""He said no,"" the Gardener added, standing just beyond the ring of trees, one hand resting lightly on his dog's neck. Not a lick of fear touched him, no surprise at the looming thing towering over us, only the sternness of a man who knew the rules. ""You don't take what isn't given.""

The spider twitched, a ripple ran through its veins, and I glimpsed Lavender's sulking face. 

""He is drowning!"" It spat. ""One strand and he could breathe again! Is that not why he's here?!"" The webs above vibrated with frustration, their images shivering, stuttering, and buffering.

""He was here to choose, not feed you."" He stepped forward, just once, and the spider recoiled. The dog padded beside him, ears raised, its eyes locked on the nearest limb. ""You have your winter; you've eaten well."" His gaze finally met me. ""But this one goes home.""

The great white legs spasmed and snapped up, whipping snow into the air, as it drew itself far back into a high dark, folding her bulk between the trunks.

""You're soft,"" it hissed, thwarted.

The man tutted, waving his hand. ""Back to your work. There'll be others.""

A tremor ran through the webs - irritation, or laughter, or both. On the nearest web, a familiar snow-dusted girl looked up from her kill with violet eyes, smiling at me across all that distance. Then the image dulled, flatlining into nothing.

""Come, boy,"" said the Gardener, turning as his dog fell into step, and headed back towards the path leading to town. ""Your mother's here. Best not keep her waiting.""

I looked once more into the trees, at ghostly webs dissolving into branches, and the fathomless dark hiding a girl-shaped monster. Then I forced my legs to move, crunching after a man and his silent hound, at a complete loss for words.

\-

Mum was pink-cheeked from the cold and utterly blown away by her parents' new home. She spotted me first and crushed me into a hug that stole my breath, fingers digging into my back. She bombarded me with a million questions; my answers were tired and brief, but it warmed me to see that her smile wasn't patched together for once.

Nan moaned about her coat being too small; Grandad poured her something strong and pretended not to be surprised when she chugged it. We ended up in the kitchen, absent its little baker. Mum perched on a stool with a forgotten tea, laughing at one of Nan's awful jokes, and I watched the corners of her mouth soften, and the endless brace in her shoulders slack slightly. Her hand found my knee under the table and rested there, a simple gesture that said far more than any apology neither of us had tried.

She met Lavender later that afternoon. Just a girl in a greased apron, helping Nan prep the roast, pressing a warm parsnip into her hand.

""You must be Leo's Mum!"" She beamed. ""Boy, I tell you - your son has been a delight!"" 

Mum grew flustered at that, a kind of pleased embarrassment she hadn't been allowed to feel in years. Lavender laughed at her jokes, eyes bright; just a neighbour's girl who knew how to fit in, and I tried not to throw up in my mouth.

Dinner came, and Mum leaned over to me, voice low and warm with wine she could actually enjoy. 

""I think that girl likes you."" A gentle, tipsy, incredulous smile tugged at her mouth. ""And, you know... I think this might be a Christmas to remember.""

I nodded, swallowing down the knot in my throat, and squeezed her hand. Outside, the snow did not cease, and somewhere beyond the windows a garden slept. 

""You have no idea,"" I said, trying my hardest to ignore the pair of kind, violet eyes that could never seem to look away, watching my mother with a hopeful, eternally famished hunger. 

I could only hope that if she hung her grief in the trees... I would recognise the woman who came back.",2,1766492654.0,stories,2,1.0,False

1ptsmi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NightmareNarratives-/comments/1ptsmi4/someone_moved_into_the_unit_above_me_but_the/,"Someone moved into the unit above me, but the building manager says that floor has been sealed for years. Every night I hear slow footsteps and a single chair scraping across the floor, always stopping right above my bed...","I live in a small apartment building on the edge of town. Nothing fancy. Beige carpet. Thin walls. The kind of place you rent because it’s cheap, close to work, and you don’t plan on staying forever.
I work nights at a logistics warehouse. Twelve-hour shifts. Lots of standing. Lots of repetition. By the time I get home, my body feels hollowed out, like I’ve already been asleep for hours and just forgot to lie down. I rent this place because I can’t afford anything better right now. Breaking the lease would wipe out what little savings I have. Moving isn’t an option.
That’s important to understand. I can’t just leave.
For the first six months, everything was normal. Quiet, even. The building only has tenants on the first three floors. I’m on the top one. Or at least, I thought I was.
The fourth floor is sealed.
That’s what the building manager told me when I signed the lease. Said it like it was a footnote. An afterthought.
“Old fire damage,” she said. “Nothing up there. Stairwell’s locked. Elevator doesn’t go that high.”
I didn’t question it. Why would I?
The first night I heard the footsteps, I assumed I was mistaken.
I’d just crawled into bed after a double shift. The room was dark except for the glow of my phone on the nightstand. I was half asleep when I heard it.
A slow step.
Then another.
Directly above me.
I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling. My first thought was simple. Someone moved in upstairs. Maybe they reopened the floor. Maybe I just missed the memo.
Then I remembered. There is no upstairs.
The footsteps weren’t heavy. No stomping. No rushing. Just deliberate. Like someone pacing. Heel to toe. Taking their time.
They crossed the ceiling from left to right. Then stopped.
I waited for them to start again.
They didn’t.
Instead, I heard something else.
A chair scraping across the floor.
Not dragged wildly. Not shoved. Pulled. Slowly. The sound of wood legs resisting concrete. It made my teeth itch. The scrape lasted maybe five seconds, then stopped.
Right above my bed.
I checked the time. 2:14 a.m.
I told myself it was pipes. Old buildings make noises. I’ve lived in enough of them to know that. Water pressure. Temperature shifts. Structural settling.
Still, pipes don’t sound like footsteps.
The next morning, I asked the building manager about it.
She frowned the way people do when they’re trying to remember something they’re sure they shouldn’t have to.
“Someone upstairs?” she repeated. “No. That floor’s been sealed since before I started working here.”
I asked her how long that was.
She hesitated. “Eight years.”
I laughed it off. Said it was probably just noise traveling weirdly through the building. She nodded a little too quickly, like she was relieved I’d offered the explanation myself.
That should have been my first red flag.
The second night, it happened again.
Same time. 2:14 a.m.
Footsteps. Slow. Measured. Crossing the ceiling. Then the chair.
Scrape.
Stop.
I lay there holding my breath, listening so hard my ears rang. I waited for something else. A cough. A creak. Anything human.
Nothing came.
By the third night, I started recording it on my phone. The audio caught the scraping sound clearly. The footsteps came through faintly, distorted, like they were happening underwater.
When I played it back in the morning, something felt off.
The footsteps didn’t echo.
In my apartment, when someone walks above you, there’s a sense of depth to the sound. Distance. Variation. These steps sounded flat. Too close. As if the ceiling wasn’t a ceiling at all, but a thin layer stretched tight over empty space.
I checked the hallway outside my unit. There was no stairwell going up. No emergency exit. Just a locked metal door at the end with a sign bolted over it.
NO ACCESS – STRUCTURAL HAZARD
I tried the handle anyway. It didn’t budge.
I started sleeping with the light on.
That’s when the pattern changed.
On the fourth night, the footsteps didn’t cross the room.
They stopped directly above my bed.
One step.
Pause.
Another step.
Pause.
Like whoever was up there knew exactly where I was lying.
The chair scraped once.
Then twice.
Shorter this time. As if it was being adjusted. Positioned.
I rolled onto my side and pressed my face into the pillow, trying not to think about angles. About weight distribution. About how ceilings work.
I told myself I was exhausted. That my brain was misfiring. I haven’t been sleeping well for months. Night shift does that to you. Makes everything feel unreal.
But exhaustion doesn’t explain why, when I finally worked up the nerve to check the building plans online, the public records showed something strange.
The fourth floor wasn’t listed as sealed.
It wasn’t listed at all.
No square footage. No units. Just… a blank space above the third floor. Like someone erased it and forgot to fill the gap.
That night, my phone lost signal at exactly 2:13 a.m.
At 2:14, the footsteps began.
This time, there was no chair.
Instead, I heard something new.
A soft thump.
Directly above my pillow.
As if something had leaned down and pressed its weight against the ceiling.
I don’t know how long I lay there without moving. I don’t remember falling asleep.
What I do remember is waking up to the sound of scraping again.
But this time, it wasn’t above me.
It was coming from inside my apartment.
And it stopped right next to my bed.

I woke up standing.
That was the first thing that felt wrong.
I wasn’t lying in bed when my eyes opened. I was upright, barefoot on the cold carpet, facing the wall beside my bed. My phone was still on the nightstand, screen dark. The lamp was on. I don’t remember turning it on.
For a few seconds, my brain tried to smooth it over. Sleepwalking. Stress. Night shift messing with my head. I’ve always been bad at sleeping. I’ve woken up sitting before. Once, years ago, I woke up with my keys in my hand and no memory of picking them up.
But I’ve never woken up standing inches from a wall, heart pounding, like I’d been listening for something.
The scraping sound was gone.
The apartment was quiet in that hollow way it gets just before dawn. No cars. No voices. Just the low hum of the refrigerator and the faint ringing in my ears that comes after a loud noise stops suddenly.
I checked the time.
2:27 a.m.
I was late.
Whatever had been happening upstairs always started at 2:14. It never lasted more than a few minutes. This time, I’d missed most of it.
I stood there for a while, trying to remember how I got out of bed. My sheets were twisted, pulled halfway off the mattress like I’d thrashed around. The pillow was on the floor.
I picked it up and froze.
There was dust on it.
Not the normal kind. Not lint or fabric fuzz. This was gray and powdery, like concrete dust. It streaked across the pillowcase in a curved smear, as if something had pressed against it from above.
I looked up at the ceiling.
Nothing looked different. No cracks. No stains. Just the same dull off-white paint it’s always been.
I didn’t go back to sleep after that.
The next morning, I called in sick. My supervisor wasn’t happy about it. I’ve already used up most of my days. But I couldn’t face another shift on no sleep, not with my nerves buzzing like exposed wires.
I went down to the office when the building manager came in.
Her name is Marlene. Late fifties. Always smells like strong coffee and cigarettes. She’s worked here long enough that she treats the place like it belongs to her personally.
I told her I needed to talk.
She sighed and followed me into her office, already annoyed. I played her the audio from my phone. The footsteps. The scraping. I watched her face while she listened.
She didn’t interrupt. Didn’t scoff. Didn’t smile.
That worried me more than anything.
When the recording ended, she set the phone down very carefully, like it was fragile.
“That’s not possible,” she said.
“You told me the floor above is sealed,” I said. “That sound is coming from directly above my unit.”
She rubbed her forehead. “That floor has been closed since before you moved in.”
I asked her again why.
This time, she didn’t answer right away.
“There was a tenant up there,” she said finally. “A long time ago.”
“What happened to them?”
She looked at the door, then back at me. Lowered her voice.
“They never officially moved out,” she said. “They stopped paying rent. Stopped answering calls. When we went up to check, the unit was… wrong.”
I asked her what that meant.
She shook her head. “We sealed the floor. That’s all you need to know.”
I told her I was hearing someone move furniture. That it always stopped above my bed. That it felt like someone knew where I was.
Her jaw tightened.
“Listen,” she said. “If this is about getting out of your lease, that’s not happening. The building is up to code. You signed the agreement.”
I wasn’t thinking about the lease. Not yet. I was thinking about the dust on my pillow. About waking up standing. About how flat the footsteps sounded.
“I think someone’s up there,” I said. “I think they’re coming down.”
She stood up so abruptly her chair scraped the floor. The sound made my stomach drop.
“That’s enough,” she said. “Go home. Get some rest.”
As I left the office, I noticed something I hadn’t before.
On the wall behind her desk was a framed evacuation map of the building. Floors one through three were labeled clearly. Apartments, stairwells, exits.
Above the third floor was a faded rectangle with no markings.
Not labeled sealed.
Not labeled closed.
Just empty.
That night, I didn’t go to bed.
I sat on the couch with all the lights on, coffee going cold on the table, eyes locked on the ceiling. Midnight passed. One o’clock. My phone kept signal this time.
At 2:13, the signal dropped to zero bars anyway.
At 2:14, the footsteps started.
They were closer now.
Not moving across the ceiling.
Just pacing in a tight circle. Back and forth. Over and over.
Then the chair scraped.
Longer than before. Slower. Like it was being dragged into position with care.
I felt the vibration through the couch cushions.
Something shifted above me. A low groan, like old wood under strain.
Then came a sound I hadn’t heard yet.
A soft knock.
From the ceiling.
One knock.
Pause.
Another.
Directly above where I was sitting.
I didn’t move. I couldn’t. My chest felt locked, like my ribs were wired shut.
The knocking continued. Slow. Patient. Always in pairs.
Then, just as suddenly, it stopped.
The apartment went silent again.
My phone buzzed in my hand as the signal came back.
A notification popped up.
Unknown Device Connected.
I don’t own any smart devices.
I stared at the message, my pulse roaring in my ears.
Then something heavy shifted above me again.
And I realized the footsteps weren’t above my bed anymore.
They were directly above my front door.

I didn’t answer the door.
I don’t mean I hesitated and chose not to. I physically couldn’t make myself stand. My legs felt locked in place, like my body had already decided that moving would make things worse.
The footsteps above the door stopped.
Then came the chair.
Scrape.
This time it sounded closer. Deeper. Like the weight behind it had increased. I imagined the chair being positioned carefully, legs set down one by one. I hated how precise the sound was.
The knocking didn’t come from the ceiling again.
It came from the door itself.
Two soft knocks. Knuckle on wood.
Pause.
Two more.
Exactly the same rhythm as before.
I stayed frozen on the couch, barely breathing. The lights were still on, but they suddenly felt useless, like stage lights illuminating something I wasn’t supposed to see.
“Hello?” a voice said.
It was quiet. Calm. Close enough that I could hear the shape of the word more than the sound.
It sounded like me.
Not a perfect imitation. Just… familiar. Same cadence. Same tired edge. Like a recording played back slightly warped.
My throat tightened. I didn’t answer.
The handle didn’t turn. Whoever it was didn’t try the lock. That felt deliberate. Like they knew it was locked and were waiting for permission.
“Maintenance,” the voice said.
That’s when something clicked.
No one ever says maintenance in this building. They say the manager’s name. Or they text first. Or they leave a note taped crookedly to the door.
I glanced at my phone. No signal again. No notifications. The earlier alert about an unknown device was gone, like it had never been there.
The footsteps above shifted. I heard them move away from the door. Back toward the center of the apartment. Toward my bedroom.
Toward my bed.
I stood up without thinking and followed the sound, my heart slamming so hard it made my vision pulse. Each step I took felt wrong, like I was moving out of sync with the room.
The footsteps stopped directly above the bed.
The chair scraped once more.
Then the ceiling creaked.
A fine line appeared in the paint, running straight down from the center of the ceiling fan. Dust drifted out, slow and lazy, catching in the light.
I stepped back just as something pressed down from above.
Not enough to break through. Just enough to bow the ceiling slightly. To show weight. Intent.
I realized then what the chair was for.
It wasn’t being dragged randomly.
It was being positioned so someone could stand on it.
To reach down.
A crackling sound came from my phone.
The screen lit up by itself.
A live audio recording was playing.
I could hear my own breathing through the speaker.
Slow. Shallow.
Recorded from somewhere inside the room.
I backed into the wall, my spine cold against the paint. “Stop,” I said. My voice sounded thin. Small.
The pressure eased.
For a moment, I thought it was over.
Then the ceiling fan clicked on.
I hadn’t touched the switch.
The fan blades began to turn, slow at first, wobbling slightly as dust rained down. Something brushed against the spinning blades from above. Something solid enough to make a dull, wet sound.
The fan sped up.
The ceiling bulged again.
Then the pressure disappeared completely.
Silence.
No footsteps. No scraping. No knocking.
Just the fan humming overhead.
I didn’t sleep that night. I didn’t turn off the fan. I sat on the floor against the wall and watched the ceiling until the sun came up.
In the morning, there was a voicemail on my phone.
No missed call. Just a message.
I hit play.
At first, it was just static. Then a faint sound underneath it.
Footsteps.
Slow. Measured.
Then my own voice, distorted but unmistakable.
“I’m home,” it said.
I deleted the message and packed a bag.
I went back to the building office to demand out of my lease. Marlene wasn’t there. The door was locked. A handwritten sign was taped to the glass.
OFFICE CLOSED – TEMPORARILY
The evacuation map was gone from the wall. In its place was a fresh one. New ink. Clean lines.
This time, the fourth floor was labeled.
One unit.
Directly above mine.
Occupied.
That night, I stayed at a friend’s place across town. Slept on their couch. Lights off. Quiet.
At 2:14 a.m., my phone vibrated.
A notification.
Unknown Device Disconnected.
Under it, another message appeared.
A voicemail.
From my own number.
I didn’t listen to it.
I don’t need to.
Because when I rolled over, half asleep, I saw something that made my blood turn to ice.
A thin line of gray dust on the couch.
Curved.
Like something had leaned down from above.
And just before I closed my eyes, I heard a familiar sound.
Slow footsteps.
Not on the ceiling.
On the floor.
Right outside the room.

I didn’t move.

I don’t mean I was scared to. I mean my body understood something my mind hadn’t caught up to yet. That the footsteps outside the room weren’t approaching.

They had already arrived.

They stopped just past the doorway. I could hear the faint shift of weight. Fabric brushing fabric. Someone standing there, deciding whether to come in.

My friend’s apartment was silent. No traffic noise. No hum of appliances. Just the sound of my own breathing, and the slow, deliberate inhale coming from the other side of the wall.

I watched the dust on the couch cushion.

It hadn’t come from the ceiling.

This apartment had another unit above it. I knew that. I’d been here before. I’d helped move furniture. There was nothing sealed. Nothing missing.

Which meant the dust came from something leaning over me.

I reached for my phone with shaking hands. The screen lit up instantly. Full signal. No glitches.

A new voicemail notification sat at the top of the screen.

1 New Message – From Me

Against every instinct I had left, I pressed play.

The message started with silence. Then a faint rustling sound, like fabric shifting close to a microphone.

Then my voice.

Not distorted this time. Not warped or stretched.

Clear. Calm.

“Hey,” it said. “I’m inside.”

I felt the air change.

The footsteps resumed, slow and soft, crossing the floor toward the couch. Each step landed with the exact same weight and rhythm as mine. No hesitation. No urgency.

I slid off the couch and backed toward the bathroom, never taking my eyes off the doorway. The light from the hallway was dim, but I could see a shape standing there now.

My height.
My build.
My posture.

It didn’t rush me. Didn’t reach out.

It just watched.

That’s when I noticed the smell.

Concrete dust. Old wood. Stale air that hadn’t moved in years.

“You don’t live here,” I whispered.

It tilted its head the way I do when I’m confused.

“I do now,” it said. “You don’t.”

Something scraped behind it.

A chair.

Dragged slowly across the floor somewhere deeper in the apartment.

I ran.

I don’t remember unlocking the bathroom door or slamming it shut. I remember the mirror.

Because when I looked up, I wasn’t alone in it.

The reflection lagged.

Just a fraction of a second. Barely noticeable. But enough.

The reflection smiled before I did.

My phone buzzed again.

Another voicemail.

I didn’t answer it. I smashed the phone against the sink until the screen went black. The lights flickered once, then steadied.

The footsteps stopped.

So did the breathing.

I stayed in that bathroom until morning, shaking, listening for any sound at all.

When I finally opened the door, the apartment was empty.

No dust. No footprints. No chair out of place.

My friend was asleep on the other side of the apartment, undisturbed.

I didn’t go back to my old unit.

I didn’t go back to the building.

I quit my job. Lost my deposit. Slept in my car for a week before finding a new place across town. Ground floor. No unit above me.

For a while, it worked.

No footsteps. No scraping. No glitches.

Then I got a letter in the mail.

No return address.

Inside was a single sheet of paper.

An updated building directory.

My old building. Floors one through three listed as usual.

The fourth floor was still there.

One unit.

Under Occupant, it had my name.

Below that, in smaller print:

Previous Resident: Vacated

Last night, at 2:14 a.m., I heard a familiar sound.

A chair scraping.

Not above me.

Not beside me.

Behind me.

And just before the footsteps started, I felt the mattress dip slightly, like someone sitting down very carefully, exactly where they know I sleep.

I haven’t turned around yet.

I don’t think I’m supposed to.

And I’m starting to realize something I wish I’d understood sooner.

That floor was never sealed to keep something in.

It was sealed to make sure only one of us could leave.",1,1766492589.0,u_NightmareNarratives-,0,1.0,False
1ptsmfr,https://i.redd.it/ou412n3e5y8g1.png,Leo Rewrite,"So the movie starts with a man called Parthiban, who runs a successful coffee shop and he is starting his day as usual (No hyena scene). He has a wife named Sathya and has two children (just like in the movie). We see his family scenes and stuff. And then we see Mysskin and his gang doing stuff.

And then we a scene where that night, a car comes to a pub and some goons get out of the car and their leader gets out of the car and that leader is- Leo. They go inside the pub and break everything and beat all the workers and owners inside the pub as the pub sells cocane, weed and other illegal drugs and he kills the owner of the pub by shooting him.

And then we get a scene in a ciggerate factory. It is not like a godown like shown in the movie. It is a proper cigarette factory. There were see the owner of the factory, Antony Das (no harold das in this movie). He is frustrated by Leo's activities as Antony operates some weed and cocane outlets secretly as his illegal businesses and Leo spoils his business.

Cut back, we see some Parthiban scenes with his family and his friend Gautham Menon character and some Mysskin scenes

One night, Mysskin and his gang enter Parthiban's coffee shop and then the coffee shop scene happens. This scene is exactly the same as shown in the movie. He shoots them all, goes to court, gets released as shown in the movie and all that happens. Parthiban's photo gets published in the newspapers and everyone see them.

One night, Leo and his henchmen talk in a place after killing a drug shop owner, one of the henchman shows Leo the image of Parthiban newspaper article. Leo looks at it surprised for some seconds and then ignored it.

Then, Antony Das and his henchman look at newspaper article. They get shocked looking at someone who looks exactly like Leo. One of henchmen who is new asks Antony Das, who is that person. Antony then shows an old photo of one of his functions. And that photo is an old photo of Leo and Rolex standing together (Badass song plays in the background). You can see the photo in the post. Interval

Then we see Antony start telling about Leo and Rolex who were his henchmen and skilled hitman once (Leo is not Antony' son here). Then, both of them left the gang. Antony was only doing tobacco business those days. Rolex was the one who introduces the idea of selling drugs. Antony didn't accept it at that time. So Rolex left and started his own drug syndicate and he grows bigger and more feared than Antony. Looking at this, Antony gets the wish to start drug business as well and wants to beat Rolex. Leo doesn't like any of these and he gets guilty about all the drug usage. He says Antony to stop doing it but Antony doesn't accept. So they fight and Leo leaves the gang. So he decides to destroy all the drug usage all over the country. So he forms a gang of his own and starts to beat and destroy all the drug outlets of Antony and Rolex.

Then, we see Antony entering Parthiban's coffee shop and we see the coffee shop scene as shown in the movie. Then we see scene of Antony Das asking Sathya about her husband and tells he is Leo. Then, we see a Kuthu song of Leo and his henchmen dancing at a night time.

Then we see scenes where Sathya and other people doubting Parthiban whether he is Leo or not. Sathya gets reminded of her strange experiences in her past when her husband dissapeared during night. She then begins to suspect Parthiban.

We see some scenes of Parthiban and Leo and Sathya and other people suspecting Parthiban and Parthiban convincing everyone that he is not Leo and so on

Then we see climax where Antony attacking Parthiban one day and Parthiban fights back Antony. Parthiban beats down Antony and accepts to him that he is infact Leo. Parthiban also says about his plans to destroy Rolex's drug empire. Antony laughs and says, ""You are just a goon who breaks the drug outlets, but Rolex is an international don. You will not be able to touch him"". Leo laughs and shoots him and kills him.

So basically, Parthiban lives as a coffee shop owning family man in the day time and at night, he turns into Leo, a vigilante with some henchmen and network who destroy all the drug outlets and kill drug lords.

Then, one fine day, Parthiban gets a mysterious call from Agent Vikram as shown in the movie.

My wife and I have always been a very close couple, we did everything together, and what I loved most in the world was spending time talking nonsense and silly things with her, having coffee.

But the harsh reality is that it's simply over. Of course, I prepared myself, and our baby, although unplanned, was never avoided and was always loved.

But our afternoons lying together are gone, we can't watch series at night anymore either; she simply falls asleep, and I don't blame her. Christmas is approaching, and she told me she was going to make Christmas cookies, but she didn't, she's so tired she must have forgotten.

Forgive me, but sometimes I regret what I did. I feel really bad typing this because I love my son. But I miss those moments terribly, the quiet house and the affection we shared during the day. Now we are two tired adults in the house.

Ultimately, I just wanted someone to promise me that everything will be okay and that this will pass.",0,1766492528.0,daddit,87,0.44,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.
