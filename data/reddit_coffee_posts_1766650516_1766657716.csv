I’m trying to rearrange my living room to fit three things: a comfortable TV area, a small work zone, and a coffee corner.

* the sun hits my face directly when I work, and my eyes get tired pretty fast
* in most other realistic layouts, the TV ends up in the corner, which makes movie watching pretty bad

I’m planning a few dates in Bangalore and I really want to choose cafés that feel comfortable, safe, and conversation-friendly, not just loud or overcrowded places where you can’t hear each other talk.
What I’m ideally looking for:
Calm and cozy vibe (not club-level music)
Comfortable seating where you can actually sit and talk
Good food & coffee (doesn’t have to be luxury, just genuinely good)
Nice ambience without being pretentious
Safe and decent crowd
Good for first or second dates
Any area is fine — Indiranagar, Koramangala, Jayanagar, Whitefield, MG Road, etc.
Bonus points if:
The place feels romantic but not awkwardly “try-hard”
Staff isn’t rushing you out
It’s a place where you would feel comfortable going on a date
I’ve seen a lot of “top 10 cafés” lists online, but they often feel very generic. I’d much rather hear real opinions and personal experiences, especially from women — what places actually felt nice, thoughtful, and date-appropriate?
If possible, please also mention:
Why you liked the place
Whether it’s better for daytime or evening dates

I was making beef stew last winter and realized halfway through that I forgot to buy beef broth. I had chicken broth but that felt wrong. I had water but that felt sad.

I remembered reading somewhere that coffee can add depth to beef dishes. I didn't have brewed coffee but I had instant coffee in the cabinet. Dissolved maybe a tablespoon of instant coffee in a cup of hot water and added it to the stew.

It was the best beef stew I've ever made. The coffee doesn't make it taste like coffee at all - it just makes the beef flavor deeper and more intense. Something about the bitterness enhancing the meat.

I've made it this way every time since and my family has no idea. My dad keeps saying I ""finally figured out how to make it right"" and asking what changed. I'm not telling him it's Folgers instant coffee because he'll think I'm insane.

The ratio I use now is about 1 tablespoon instant coffee per 4 cups of liquid. Dissolve it first in a little hot water so you don't get clumps. Add it when you add your broth.

Tried it with pot roast too and same result - just makes everything taste richer and more complex without tasting like coffee.

1pva84u,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1pva84u/full_guide_to_overcoming_bad_habits_from_someone/,"Full guide to overcoming bad habits, from someone who wasted 6 years of his life","I was the definition of self-sabotage. My rock bottom came last winter when I realized I hadn't gone a single day in years without binge eating, procrastinating important work until the last minute, and staying up until 3 AM doom scrolling. My health was deteriorating, my career was stagnating, and my relationships were suffering. I was trapped in a prison of my own making.

THE FAILED ATTEMPTS

Before I share what worked, let me tell you what didn't. I tried cold turkey quitting (lasted 2 days), using willpower (depleted by noon), and setting ambitious goals (abandoned within a week). I downloaded productivity apps that went unused and bought planners that gathered dust. Each failure reinforced my belief that I was just ""wired this way"" and would never change.

ENVIRONMENT DESIGN

The first breakthrough came when I realized willpower is finite, but environment design is forever. I completely restructured my physical spaces:

* Removed all junk food and replaced with pre-prepped healthy meals
* Created a designated workspace with no entertainment devices
* Set up charging stations for all devices outside the bedroom
* Pre-packed gym bags and placed them by the door
* Deleted social media apps and set up website blockers

At first, I felt ridiculous baby-proofing my life this way. But I learned that successful habit change isn't about strength it's about removing friction from good behaviors and adding friction to bad ones. James Clear's ""Atomic Habits"" was instrumental in helping me understand this concept.

IDENTITY SHIFT

The next phase was the hardest but most transformative. Instead of focusing on what I wanted to do, I focused on who I wanted to become. I started making statements like:

* ""I'm a person who reads before bed"" (not ""I should read more"")
* ""I'm someone who prioritizes sleep"" (not ""I need to stop staying up late"")
* ""I'm the kind of person who shows up early"" (not ""I should stop being late"")

This identity-based approach felt fake at first almost like I was lying to myself. But over time, as I took small actions aligned with these identities, they started feeling genuine. The shift from ""trying to change"" to ""becoming someone else"" was profound.

HABIT STACKING AND TRIGGERS

I learned to attach new habits to existing ones, creating automatic triggers:

* After brushing teeth → 1 minute meditation
* After pouring morning coffee → write three priorities for the day
* After arriving home → immediately change into workout clothes
* After dinner → 15-minute cleanup

By connecting new behaviors to established routines, I bypassed the decision-making process that often derailed me.

ACCOUNTABILITY AND MEASUREMENT

I created simple tracking systems:

* A habit tracker app with daily check-ins
* Weekly reviews with measurable data points
* Monthly check-ins with an accountability partner
* Quarterly ""habit audits"" to eliminate what wasn't working

Seeing my progress visually provided both motivation and feedback. I could identify patterns like how poor sleep predictably led to poor eating the next day and adjust accordingly.

THE TRANSFORMATION

The first two months felt like pushing a boulder uphill. Everything was forced, uncomfortable, and unnatural. But around month three, something shifted. New behaviors started feeling easier than old ones. My energy levels improved, which made good decisions easier, which improved my energy further.

Now, eight months in, what once seemed impossible feels like my default mode. I've maintained consistent sleep, nutrition, and productivity habits. I've developed a reading practice, regular exercise routine, and mindfulness habits that have completely transformed my mental clarity.

THE SCIENCE OF HABIT CHANGE

Understanding the neurological basis of habits helped immensely. I learned about the habit loop (cue, craving, response, reward) and how to manipulate each component. I realized my bad habits weren't character flaws but automated responses to specific triggers.

Books that helped me understand this included:

* ""The Power of Habit"" by Charles Duhigg
* ""Tiny Habits"" by BJ Fogg
* ""Why We Do What We Do"" by Edward Deci

HANDLING SETBACKS

Perhaps the most important lesson was learning how to handle inevitable failures. Instead of letting a single slip-up become a complete relapse (the ""what the hell effect""), I developed a ""recovery protocol"" specific steps to take after breaking a habit streak.

This mental framework prevented the all-or-nothing thinking that had sabotaged my previous attempts.

I've learned that lasting change isn't about perfection but about how quickly you get back on track after deviating.

FINAL THOUGHTS

The journey from being controlled by habits to controlling them has been the most meaningful transformation of my life. What started as an attempt to fix specific behaviors has evolved into a completely different relationship with myself.

If you're currently struggling with bad habits that feel impossible to break, remember that action precedes motivation, not the other way around. You won't ""feel like"" changing until after you've started changing.

So far i've only watched it weekly. And then go on these discussions. Which honestly, although I usually enjoy that, and some of the things that have played out I was on the same page as you folks. But I wonder if these theories may have ruined a part of the watching experience. It's almost like a spoiler. But maybe thats just me. 

But some of the details I would've never caught if it wasn't for this subreddit, despite watching frame to frame and rewinding if needed. Some of these theories that didn't pan out were still super interesting and wild to read. 

Great show but jeez the dread that is having to wait on each cliffhanger. Better Call Saul I stopped watching after S4, I think when >!Chuck's house is burnt/dies??)!<

Not because of dislike or anything, in fact I thoroughly enjoyed it, but bcuz by the time I think another season came out I forgot a lot of things/the flow of the show. I still remember many things, though, out of pure fondness/sentiment. (Saul + kids + billboard, Mike in the backyard talking to his daughter, Saul & Kim brushing together, the song Coffee Cold + scene).

I have still yet to finish it, I don't want to watch it all over again sorry. Life doesn't wait on ya and I'm too busy and with a billion-number list on my watchlist.

I'm going to make another post about Carol being too much of a center focus, I really wanted to see other parts of the world/characters. Maneousea was a fresh breath of air. Loved the stylistic choices for him (the car, landscapes, one liners like ""My mother was a bitch.)

The (killer) description/hook of the show was defintley not lying tho lol:

***""The most miserable person on Earth must save the world from happiness.""***

I actually like Carol, and loved Rhea Seehorn in BCS. but jeez carol is a bit annnoying to say the least, I got family like that IRL and jeez the arrogance is such a mood killer. Seriously, youre rock bottom as it can get (wife dead, the world is ending) & heres these 12 other people, still doesn't even have any manners or trying to understand lol wow fuck ya

Carol seemed cool in the first episode. And look I get depression, addiction, but being a dick, and a stupid one too? And her inability to say sorry Yikes lol  


And look everything makes sense, its not wrong, its even realistic (her character) still bro I dont wanna see her snoring off benzos for 3 minutes pacing around.   


I realized rereading this that I may be making unfair comparisons between better caul saul and that may be unfair but I'm only doing so cuz it seems like the creator has this style and its what hes going to stick with. I appreciate a well-paced slow burn but Idk maybe my adhd just been undermedicated latley. No i dont have a tick tock brain btw lol

Felt suffocated sometimes by carol, which i guess is how she probably felt too. It was just a bit much at times is all.

Is this relationship salvageable?,"Hey everyone, I know this is quite long, but I feel like it needs these details to show the whole situation. If anyone is willing to read this and weigh in, it would be hugely appreciated!

In March of this year, about two months into seeing each other, my girlfriend told me she had booked a weekend trip for her 35th birthday in November. The trip was to an extremely expensive and extravagant hotel about a 4 hour drive from us. It was a level of fanciness I wouldn’t even know existed if she hadn’t told me about this place. She said she booked it before we started dating and invited me to come along.

I was going through a work transition at the time and looking for a new job. I was honest with her, I said I would love to spend your birthday weekend together, but there’s no way I’d be able to afford to even make a dent in the cost of the trip. She said not to worry about it all, that she’d be going alone if we hadn’t been dating, and she really wanted me to be there.

Fast forward 8-9 months. Everything started out fine on the drive up. We got some dinner near a motel, and had to get up early to make it in time to check into the main hotel for the weekend. At around 3am, I woke up to her yelling at me to get up. She said she was really hot in the room and asked me to do something about it. She was fanning the motel door to get air in, and demanded that I wake up and do something. I wasn’t really sure what to do. I got up, checked the thermostat and it was 70 degrees, so I turned it down.

A few hours later our alarms go off. She’s really agitated and telling me we need to leave right now to make sure we check in to the hotel in time. We both needed coffee so we made a stop at a cafe on the way. We got our coffee and started walking back out to the car. She stopped me and in an aggravated way said “what are you doing?? Why are you in such a rush? I thought it would be nice if we sat down and drank coffee together.” I said I thought we were in a hurry to get to the hotel. She said no I really wanted to sit and drink coffee together. So we sat down, and I was super tired and feeling like I can do no right. I’m either taking too long or going too fast.

We checked into the hotel and they needed a couple of hours to get our room ready. As soon as we got there she said she had signed up for a yoga class for that time, and left to go join it. I walked around the grounds for a while.

Later when we got up to the room, I was exhausted from waking up in the middle of the night, then again at 6:30am, then from all the arguing and catching shit no matter what I did. She said she wanted to have sex, and I told her I was about to pass out. I said I need to sleep for a little bit, because I wanted to make sure I had enough time to sleep and get ready for dinner. She started yelling at me and berating me for not wanting to do it. Talking about how it’s her birthday and she’s paying for the room and we should be doing what she wants. I kept telling her how exhausted I was and that we’d both enjoy it more if I had more energy. She kept raising her voice and demanding that we do it, and again I eventually relented.

After we had sex, she went to the bathroom to start getting ready. She got done with 5 minutes before we had to leave, so I hopped in the shower. While I was in the shower she was yelling through the door that we needed to leave now. I told her that’s why I wanted to make sure I had enough time to sleep and get ready earlier. It didn’t matter, she kept going on about how I was making us late to dinner.

I’ll fast forward through the dinner, but all of this so far created a really tense and unpleasant environment.

We got back to the room and she looked at the trash can in the corner and said she didn’t want the trash to stay in the room overnight. I looked and saw it was just a brown grocery bag with a paper cup and a couple of chip bags in it. The front desk/nearest place to dump the trash was a mile walk down a long road and then down a steep hill. I told her it was hardly any trash and it’s not a big deal. She raised her voice, screamed and threw a tantrum about how she wouldn’t be able to sleep with trash in the room. Again, l gave in and made the walk down the long road and down the hill and threw the trash out.

I got back and she was laying in bed. I laid down next to her and she said in a soft voice, “John?.” Yea. “Do you think we’ll be together forever?”

The next day we fought about the trash fight from the night before. She stormed out of the room and left to go walk the grounds alone. She came back and we fought again. It went on like this all weekend. At one point I was in the hotel on my phone and she yelled at me for being rude for being on my phone mid conversation. The problem is we weren’t in a conversation, we were just hanging out lounging.

This dynamic continued for the entirety of the next two days. Just fight after fight over nothing at this $1,200/night hotel. Neither of us enjoying it and just having a totally miserable time.

She had told me on the drive up that growing up her family life was horrible, and that they had money but emotionally it was a living hell. During the second night at the hotel, we sat in complete silence in a giant hot tub dug into a hillside overlooking the Pacific Ocean, and I thought about what she said, and how that exact same dynamic she described seemed to be playing out. An emotional hellscape within fancy an environment.

On the way home I told her how awful the weekend was for me, and how upset I was about being picked at for 4 days straight. I told her I needed a few days of space. Since then she has apologized and acknowledged that she regretted acting the way she did. My question is, is there anything I can say or do that can get things back to the way they were before all of this happened and make this work going forward? I hadn’t caught many glimpses of this side of her for the first 8-9 months we dated, but that weekend made me feel completely insane.

I meet a girl. She is usually pretty or very beautiful, a bit detached, with something artistic, original, slightly weird that already attracts me a lot.

We talk, maybe grab a coffee, drinks, or go for a walk. We seem to get along really well. She is funny, witty, smart, unconventional. Exactly the kind of person I could fall for.

I ask her sign. Of course, she's an Aquarius. We talk about astrology, philosophy, music. My favorite topics. We talk about her life, my life, deep things. We find interesting things in common. I might give a few light compliments. Sometimes there is a bit of physical closeness or light touch. She gives me her number.

One or two days later I text her and ask to meet again.

No answer.

Two or three days pass. I send something light or funny related to something we talked about. She answers immediately, laughs, maybe adds a comment, but nothing that really continues the conversation. I ask again about meeting and she leaves me on read.

This has happened last week, identical to many, many other times. Great first connection, but then nothing.

What am I doing wrong? Am I being too direct, or not direct enough? Why she doesn’t clearly states she’s not interested? And most of all, how do I break this pattern?

So it’s Christmas Eve, grandma falls due to sweating and diarrhea (she ate something she shouldn’t have like lots of sweets/coffee and a Cajun chicken sandwich. She’s 86. She start crying and freaks out asking if she’s going to die. Grandma is fine, no bruises no bumps, no scratches no breaks. I ran out my room when I heard something my uncle got to her first. She got scared then calmed down after 20 mins. We chilled with her when we put her to be until she felt comfortable being left alone. We’ve been up for an hour low key checking up on her. This is the first time this has happened. (Yes she has a motor chair for stairs.) She fell from flat ground.

Meanwhile my dad saw this, shrugged, got pissed off and fucked off downstairs.

Anyways grandma lives alone. She lives in her province due to lots of close relatives that are practically family and some family members (her age). Meanwhile her immediate family are back in the states including me. She doesn’t want to leave due to her connections, she can’t speak English well it’s not her first language and would have hard time making connections/already gets lonely even where she’s at times, it’d be worse if she moved with my uncle in Texas where she has no one else.

She’s currently being taken care of by our cousin who’s younger, but has his own parents to worry about. He’s an angel, visits her everyday.

Should I not take classes this semester and spend the next 5 months with her until grad school? Problem is I live far like 4 hour flight away. It’s expensive.

We thought, this could spice things up a bit- also, because our sexdrive is different. We spoke about rules, about dos and don´ts- for example, not to date at work. Also we spoke about turning things back into a monogamous relationship, when a person would feel uncomfortable- because of course you can’t predict every feeling you might feel when something happens. 

It actually happened, that I dated more than my gf. I had seven dates in a period of 1 and a half- ish years. 

I often tried to check in with my gf, if she is ok and if the CNM is still ok for her. After the first date I had, she told me what she didn’t like and we had a good talk- then I fixed my behaviour. After that, it felt like there was not much of a dialogue anymore. She always said that she was fine, and everything is cool. She also didn’t really seem to care. That she didn’t date anyone, wouldn’t bother her- she just wasn’t into the mood to do so. 

After a bit more than a year, after we opened up, she went on a vacation. I had to work, so I didn’t join. During her vacation, I went on a rave with friends. It happened, that I kissed a friend, that I knew about ten years, even before my gf. We also texted for a period of time before the rave and the vibe between us was very good. When my gf came back, I told her that- and she was shocked. She felt very bad, was really sad- and I felt deeply sorry, because of course, I didn’t want that.

I didn´t break any rule of our CNM. Since that kiss, we went back to a monogamous Relationship.



The problem now: I am still friends with the person I kissed. I don’t have romantic feelings whatsoever, we just get along really well- share a lot of interests.  Sometimes, we meet up for a coffee. Of course I told my gf, that I am not into her- we were at a rave, and it was all just for fun.

She doesn’t feel good about that friendship, She also doesn’t allow my friend to come over to our flat, and she doest want to see her- I respect that. But to give that friendship up, is something, I just don’t want to do. I Also don’t want to lose my relationship, but I don’t want to hurt her feelings.

I Just wish we could all be friends.



So: AMITA for being still friends with the friend I kissed during a CNM, when it makes my gf feel uncomfortable? ",0,1766656010.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

She’s 86. Grandma is fine, no bruises no bumps, no scratches no breaks. She got scared. I ran out my room when I heard something my uncle got to her first. We chilled with her when we put her to be until she felt comfortable being left alone. We’ve been up for an hour low key checking up on her. This is the first time this has happened.

Meanwhile my dad saw this, shrugged, got pissed off and fucked off downstairs.

Anyways grandma lives alone. She lives in her province due to lots of close relatives that are practically family and some family members (her age). Meanwhile her immediate family are back in the states including me. She doesn’t want to leave due to her connections, she can’t speak English well it’s not her first language and would have hard time making connections/already gets lonely even where she’s at times, it’d be worse if she moved with my uncle in Texas where she has no one else.

She’s currently being taken care of by our cousin who’s younger, but has his own parents to worry about. He’s an angel, visits her everyday.

Should I not take classes this semester and spend the next 5 months with her until grad school? Problem is I live far like 4 hour flight away. It’s expensive. Should I hang back until I go to grad school? I’m the youngest yet my cousins don’t gaf, my uncles don’t visit when totally can, and my dad is kind of a dick. This city is amazing, I wish I could live her long term, but I don’t know the logistics not being a citizen here in canada, bc. I just want my grandma to be happy, to be FELT taken care of.

Also. I’m already in a long distant serious relationship, I’m in the closet. (Grandma can’t know that’s break her heart, she always suspects but I shut that down this week. I’m her favorite and don’t want to make her sad.)",1,1766655682.0,Advice,3,0.99,False

1pv9ugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalWrites/comments/1pv9ugs/deathbed/,Deathbed::,"DEATHBED : It’s Friday again. The long, narrow and liminal alley in front of my apartment filled with school going children running and shouting at each other made me realize that another week had passed. This marked the second month since I had been to college. My parents don’t know about it since I live alone. But I wished that they had. I wished that only one of them would visit this godforsaken place and drag me out of here. But wishful thinking it was.



It’s midnight now. The street lights are lit and the streets are covered with thick cold mist. I opened the gate slowly as I did not want to make much noise in the middle of the night. The landlord is a good old man but is a bit stingy when it comes to discipline. And he doesn’t like it when I go out at night. He was a very tall man, pale and skinny. He had an abnormal number of moles in his face which he didn’t like other people pointing out. He wore thick glasses. He lived alone. His wife died a couple of years back and his only son was working abroad. You could tell that he felt lonely at times. His face would show a subtle darker complexion whenever he used to talk about his son or his deceased wife. Tomorrow he’s going to the cemetery. Every Saturday morning he visits his wife in an ironed pink shirt that contradicts the tone on his face when he visits and a  beige colored pants with brown shoes. I once told him that  this was a very unique or kind of ambiguous combination. “They both laughed for an hour when I wore this on his birthday” he said, diverting his eyes off of me.



There was no sign of the cold mist diluting. So there I roam in the streets of the city which I loathe so much. I never liked any city for that matter. In every life, I would always choose the country mouse rather than the city mouse. “That’s just stupid” that's what my friends said when I told them. But that was years ago. They’ve probably forgotten me by now. 



A couple of people are coming towards me. Maybe three or four boys. They are loud. They sound drunk. I walk on the other side of the road. I have a habit of pretending to chew something or doing something with my tongue whenever I am among people. But they couldn't see me, for even I couldn't see them in this heavy mist and the darkness. 



It’s 3 AM now. Too late or too early to do anything. I am in the middle of the woods surrounded by nothing but large trees and cold air. My periphery engulfed by this eerie darkness while my ears freeze in the cold. I had packed coffee in my little white thermos. It seemed like a perfect place to drink it. Oh and I also had a cigarette with me. I bought it yesterday. The shopkeeper gave me a look from top to bottom when I asked her for a cigarette. But I had no lighter or matches to light it. So I sat there on a stone drinking my coffee and pretending to smoke the moist cigarette.



The mist is starting to spread around. It was getting slightly brighter. My night had ended. I thought about taking a different route on the way back to my apartment. I must’ve walked for 45 minutes when I reached the cemetery. It was the same cemetery in which the landlord's wife was buried. I had partially  hoped to bump into him there but it was empty. “ Anny Smith” “Wife, Mother , Writer”. It was written on the plaque. I didn’t know she was a writer. He never told me. I stare at my wrist at the numerous cuts of blade each of different sizes.



The smaller ones are the ones which I cut at the beginning. I was scared, scared of getting hurt, scared of being forgotten, scared of not being found. And as time passed, the cuts grew both in number and size. Nietzsche said""if you stare at the abyss the abyss stares back"". I wonder if death is looking right at me as I look into these cuts hoping to find my end with each attempt. I wished that someone would see these cuts of mine and take me away from this hellhole of a world. Ah yes, of course these wishful thinking never left me. Maybe the only salvation I'm ever going to get is this wishful thinking. I hear someone walking behind me. It was the landlord. In the same outfit as every Saturday morning. “Damnation” I thought. I had picked it up from Dostoevsky's books. 



I thought that I would see the same complexion as every time he came here in this cemetery but it was different this time. His eyes showed something different. He looked like a man who had just found the meaning of his life. His eyes were full of virtue and calmness. We say nothing to each other and go on my way. 



It was 2 PM. I just woke up due to the commotion near my apartment. A lot of people were talking and there was an atmosphere of commotion. Someone knocked at my door then. I thought it was the landlord. When I opened the door, it was the neighbor. “Do you know that uncle Sam committed suicide” he said. Sam was my landlord's name. “ Where?” I asked instinctively. “In the woods” he said. I told him I would come down in a couple of minutes but I didn’t go.



“Is that why his eyes were so contemptuous?” I thought. Maybe tomorrow I won’t forget the lighter.",1,1766655373.0,NepalWrites,0,1.0,False

I can’t find a good job and I constantly feel like my inner light has dimmed to no return. I decided it would be good to try out this new spot, Las Vegas, because the living situation was a once in a lifetime deal. My gf’s (29F) dad offered for us to live in his second home for almost free. I felt like it would be a great environment to start over and truly see if my partner and I are meant to be. 

So far, it has been an internal train wreck. I have completely lost my self esteem because we were experiencing a year long dead bedroom situation. The job market is very hard out here and I have a difficult time wanting to work in the casinos because of the overall culture. Hell I have a hard time job searching because I just don’t want to be here. Every time I sit down to make music, I can’t make anything that makes me happy. I rarely ever get good sleep because my partner snores so loud that I just go to the couch. It feels like I’ve hit this spiritual draught without even a mirage in sight to give me some hope.

Most of my friends say I just need to look at the positives but it just isn’t enough anymore. My life has changed so much in the past couple of years I don’t know how to properly adapt to it. I’m in such a comfy situation yet I feel depressed. I don’t have money for a therapist and I don’t have health insurance anymore. How much more must I lie to myself to force a semblance of happiness? Why is joy such a delicacy now? As of now the only thing that makes me feel normal is my morning coffee and going to the gym. I think I fantasize about leaving every day yet I can’t financially do it. 

Man there’s so much I want to put in here I’m sorry it’s sporadic. If anyone has sources that can help pay for therapy or something of the sort, please send them. I think I need it now more than ever.

I feel like it’s important to note that my relationship has been almost 8 years and we were best friends for 4 years before that.

💚 Skin1004 Centella Ampoule – Absolute holy grail for my sensitive, acne-prone skin. Calms, soothes, repairs. Already restocked. 10/10

💧 COSRX Oil-Free Ultra Moisturising Lotion – Perfect lightweight hydration for combination/oily skin days. Great for layering. Backup done. 9/10

🐌 COSRX Snail Mucin – Helps with barrier repair, plumps the skin, and gives that glass-skin glow. Multiple backups. 10/10

🌙 Laneige Bouncy & Firm Sleeping Mask – Mixed reviews online, but it suits my skin. Woke up with soft, supple skin every time. 9/10

🤍 CeraVe Moisturising Lotion – My go-to for tretinoin days and lazy skincare nights. Simple, effective, no fuss. Will repurchase. 10/10

Products that didn’t work for my face 👀

🚫 Plum Rice Water & Niacinamide Gel – Clogged my pores. Finished it on my body.

🍃 Plum Green Tea Clay Mask – Too drying for my face, but surprisingly worked well as a scalp cleanse when mixed with shampoo.

🚫 The Derma Co 2% Alpha Arbutin Serum – No visible results. Used it up on my body.

🚫 The Derma Co 2% Kojic Acid Cream – Broke me out. Repurposed as a hand cream.

🧴 Cosmo-Q Shampoo – Dermat-prescribed but felt like a regular shampoo.

🍼 Johnson’s Baby Oil – Worked well as a body oil.

☕ MCaffeine Coffee Body Scrub – Messy and overrated. DIY coffee + coconut oil works the same.

👣 Nykaa Lip Crush Macaron Lip Balm – Hated the fragrance. Became my nighttime foot cream.

I’d prefer to interact less and not deal with carts but I hear online shopping can be stressful? If anyone can give me feedback and experience if you have it with either please let me know. I only really have 10-15 hours maximum available do you thats enough and I only have it for limited hours Tuesday/thursday/Friday but all day Saturday and Sunday. Just want to get a feel of others perspectives of what to expect and if it’s worth it or if I should just try to get a job with a coffee place instead. Thanks. ,1,1766654728.0,kroger,1,1.0,False

The real daughter had a baby syndrome. 

She ate out of toddler bowls, slept in a cradle, and insisted on riding in a stroller whenever she left 

the house. 

And that wasn’t all. 

She had the whole law firm remodeled into something straight out of a daycare center, with pastel walls, cartoon murals, and a cafeteria that only served applesauce and oatmeal. 

Even the client coffee bar was replaced with a formula-making station, like that was a totally 

normal thing to offer adults in a legal office. 

“Adults are gross,” she declared. “We need to cleanse the world with pure baby hearts!” 

Our guilt-ridden parents gave in to her every whim, and even my fiancé told me, “Liora, you twenty years of her life. Can’t you be a little more understanding?” 

took 

On the day of the final trial for our firm’s most important case, the entire courtroom sat waiting… 

for her nap to end. 

The judge’s face had gone stone cold. I stepped up in her place, delivered a brilliant defense, saved the client’s $300 million in damages, and earned myself a partner seat at the firm. 

She completely lost face and ran up to the rooftop in a drunken meltdown, trying to drink herself numb. She slipped, missed her footing, and fell to her death. 

And somehow, my parents and my fiancé decided it was all my fault. 

“You take everything from her,” they accused. “Even a sure-win case… why couldn’t you just let 

her have it?” 

They tied me to a chair and dragged in clients I’d once beaten in court. One knife each. 

I died in agony, then opened my eyes… 

I was back to the day the real daughter pouted and begged to take the case. 

This time, I turned around and walked straight into our rival law firm. 

If that case was such a guaranteed win, let them choke on the loss. 

Chanter ?

“Liora, just give the case to me, okay?” 

Her 

syrupy voice 

rang 

in my ears. 

Celene Crosswell, dressed head-to-toe in a custom pink onesie, was practically hanging off Cassian 

Veylor. 

She pouted, her twin pigtails swatting at his arms as she bounced in place. 

“I really wanna try the Thornridge case too!” 

Cassian looked at me, his face full of hesitation. 

“Liora, Celene’s new here. She needs to build confidence. You’ve got a lot on your plate anyway. Why not let her take this one for practice?” 

His voice was as soft as ever, but it sent a chill straight down my spine. 

In my last life, he was the one who stabbed me in the heart in the end. 

“You owe Celene your life,” he’d said. 

His eyes were colder and more unfamiliar than I’d ever seen. 

When I didn’t respond right away, my dad, still holding a baby bottle, scowled. 

“You already took twenty years from Celene. Now you’re fighting her over a small case like this?” 

A small case? I nearly laughed. 

The Thornridge Group was facing a $300 million commercial fraud charge. The prosecution had airtight evidence on paper; it was an open-and-shut case. 

But I’d pulled fifteen all-nighters, dug through thousands of pages of material, and finally uncovered one loophole, a slim shot at flipping the outcome. 

That “sure-win” had been carved out of blood, sweat, and everything I had left. 

I pushed down the fury building in my chest and spoke, steady as stone. 

“Fine. Give her the case.” 

The room eased instantly.

Celene let out a gleeful squeal and planted a loud kiss on Cassian’s cheek. 

“I get to stand next to my favorite Cassie now!” 

He stiffened, glancing at me nervously. 

“Liora, don’t take it the wrong way. Celene’s got a baby mindset. She acts like this with everyone she likes. It doesn’t mean anything.” 

He said the exact same thing last time. 

Even scolded me for having such “dirty adult thoughts” about a baby. 

But I’d never seen Celene kiss anyone else, only him, and always when she knew I was watching. 

I smiled faintly. 

“I get it. Since Celene wants the case, I’ll step back. I’ll organize the files and pass everything over.” ",1,1766654695.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

I literally never get a chance to just breathe to the point it's driving me insane, but it's a problem that the laundry isn't done. I guess I'm supposed to let the boys beat each other up and the baby scream and scream just so I can get some fucking laundry done. And my husband wants to get after me for staying up til 4:30 every night, but he bitches if his jeans aren't washed, if I wasn't able to get to the dishes, or if I forgot to prep the coffee in the morning. He's also currently snoring away in his chair after insisting he just wanted to help with the baby. But he sure made a hell of a big show of yawning and ""snoring"" and ""dozing off"" 6 minutes after I start pumping while he feeds the baby with a bottle. Even though I'm literally dealing with something that's making me dizzy and pass out from time to time but I still manage to stay up til 4 fucking 30 for the past 3 days.

**I've released my open-source La Marzocco display controller!**

After months of development, I'm excited to share my project ""LaMarzocco Display"": [https://github.com/TobiKr/LaMarzocco-Display](https://github.com/TobiKr/LaMarzocco-Display)

**Features:**

* Power and steam control (on/off)
* Real-time ready indicators for coffee and steam
* Coffee boiler temperature and steam level monitoring
* Shot timer during brewing (still being refined for accuracy)
* **No hardware modifications required** – everything works through La Marzocco's APIs

**Hardware needed:** Just a [Lilygo S3 Display](http://lilygo.cc/products/t-display-s3-amoled)  (\~$20-30). The GitHub repo has step-by-step instructions for flashing the firmware.

**Project background:** I initially explored monetizing this and even hired a developer to build a proof of concept. However, I ultimately decided the community would benefit more from an open-source release.

Unfortunately, La Marzocco has since changed their API architecture, moving from local real-time access to cloud-based endpoints. This introduces latency for commands and affects shot timer accuracy – something I'm actively working to improve.

**Looking for contributors:** I'm focusing on other projects in 2026, so I'd love help with:

* Reducing shot timer latency
* Smoothing UI responsiveness during control changes
* General improvements and testing

Feel free to fork, contribute, or open issues on GitHub. Happy brewing!

(tw for seizures, emotional abuse)","About me: I was emotionally abused by both of my parents as a kid—emotionally neglected, screamed at, made to walk on eggshells all the time. In 2017 I learned about CPTSD and what I'd gone through all clicked, and I put a lot of time into working on healing: I went low contact with my parents, pursued therapy, worked really hard on inner child work and self parenting. I saw big strides and in 2022 felt like I'd gotten 90% there—I felt like I was back in my body, in charge of my choices, finally coming out of the trauma shell. I resumed contact with my parents and though things weren't great, they were ok, and my relationship with my mom especially seemed decent. 

After all this, though, I went through another rough period, where I moved out on my own and quickly started spiraling into depression. During this time I'd call my mom while having panic attacks, and she'd talk me through them. After a really horrible friend breakup in early 2024, I asked her to fly out to visit me—just to have someone to hold onto. She did, and for three days, it was great. I had her full attention in a way I'd never had since I was very little, and I felt really comforted and loved on.

At the end of the three days she was supposed to head back home, but she broached the idea that maybe I could go back home with her—sublet my apartment and fully move back home with her and my dad. I was very, very on the fence—on the one hand, part of the reason I'd moved in the first place was because I was so miserable living with them; on the other hand, my mom had been so great on this visit, and I thought if I could be around more of that love and care, it would heal something in me. On her end, she said that I'd be her #1 priority, that she'd take care of me, that she would make sure I could still be independent but she'd be there to give me emotional support. I asked her over and over again if she was sure. She said yes. Whenever I mentioned not moving home, her face fell. She really wanted me to come home and promised over and over that it would be about caring for me. 

I agreed after days of indecision, we got a rental car, I found a subletter, and the night after I signed my apartment away I had a seizure. It went on for about an hour. I couldn't control the way my body was shaking. I thought it was just a very severe panic attack, but it was scary. My mom sat with me while I had it, soothing, trying to help. 

The next day my mom and I start driving home, and I mention several times how nervous I am to be moving back home, how I'm not sure if it was the right decision. She keeps promising that we'll make it work, and it'll be okay. We drive for a few days and we get home, and within twenty minutes I start having another seizure.

She just stands there, looking at me. Doesn't move. Asks me what she should do. I'm confused, because I expect her to do the same things she was doing back at my apartment—just stay with me and talk me through it. But it's like she'd forgotten everything she had been doing for the last week—just acted confused, like I should be in charge right now and explain to her what to do. She seemed out of it, like a lost kid. 

When my dad gets home, it's worse. I'm angry because I had the seizure and she didn't do anything to help. Dad comes home and the two of them ignore me when I start crying, then get mad at me for getting upset. Dad just watches me sob and Mom goes upstairs alone, leaving me there in the kitchen just crying my eyes out. I am flat-out spiraling at this time, panicked at being back home. I spent the night in a hotel to calm down but the next day I was back.

For four months I lived with them and was having seizures almost every day. That whole time, my mom either ignored them, asked me to talk her through them while I was in them (ignoring advice I'd given earlier when I wasn't actively in the middle of seizing), or berated me/got angry at me for having them. My dad mostly ignored them but occasionally got mad at me for them too. I felt like I was going crazy, because all the things my mom had promised absolutely vanished—there was no care, I was not a priority, there was no independence. I became completely isolated from everyone except them, bedbound in pain, terrified by what was going on with my body, trying to figure out on my own how to calm down. I was also hugely triggered through all this, and knew it, and was trying to parse how much of this was like a CPTSD over-reaction and how much of this was actually bad and abusive. 

I tried talking to my mom several times about what had happened on the move, especially why she had told me to come home when she had no plan for what to do with me once we got there. She would get furious with me, berate me, scream at me, or refuse to talk about it. One time I started having a seizure and she reached out to touch my back, and I screamed in pain because her touch felt like fire. She stormed up to the second floor, and my dad followed shortly after her. I was left seizing up in our basement for the next hour. Nobody came to check on me or make sure I didn't accidentally hurt myself. 

After four months the seizures died back and I found some gigs that let me work outside the house for a few weeks at a time. Those helped, but since then I have found 0 ability to motivate myself to actually leave for good. It's now been a year and a half, and I'm still living with them. I know I need to move, but every time I try to plan something, I'm swamped by indecision—how can I move somewhere and make sure this never happens again and I end up back here? More broadly, what lesson can I even take away from this experience? I still feel unclear on what actually happened—how much was me being a giant baby wanting to be cared for beyond what's reasonable to expect, and how much was truly bad behavior from my parents. I wasn't some innocent victim while I was seizing—I would be angry, I'd yell, I was furious. It's hard for me to figure out what exactly happened here, where my trauma glasses stop and reality begins. 

I've tried about a dozen times to discuss this with my mom, get her side of the story,but she refuses—sighs and says ""haven't we already talked about this!"", says she has nothing left to say, says she doesn't remember. Both her and my dad now act like everything is normal. My mom is excited to see me in the morning, eager to bake foods she knows I'll like, wants to have coffee dates and shopping trips with me. But I cannot move past those months of being alone in my room, having seizures, and her and my dad just acting like nothing was going on, or if anything WAS going on it was my fault. I feel crazy that this significant thing happened to me, that I'm still having seizures every few weeks as a consequence, and it doesn't seem to have factored into my family at all. I went from someone who was physically healthy with depression symptoms to someone always checking to see if an episode is coming on, trying so hard not to do anything that will trigger one. My thyroid also collapsed this year—idk if that was part of the stress or just an extra health issue.

I've seen a few different therapists about this over the last year and a half, but so far none of them have been able to help me parse this. I'm haunted by wondering if what happened here was caused by me, or if this was truly an abuse situation and I need to prioritize getting out and going low/no contact. I'm struggling hard with deciding what to do next, because I'm terrified of making the same mistakes again if I don't process what really went wrong here. I'm also worried that if I move in the wrong direction, the stress will get so bad the seizures will get even worse (or turn into a whole nother health issue). 

Basically, I could use any advice from someone not in this situation who can look at it clearly to help me navigate. How can I start processing what happened to me? What can I do to calm down my nervous system? How can I trust myself to make smart choices and plan a sustainable move when I got myself into this? I'm just...paralyzed. Scared of making it worse, knowing it's bad now. 

Sorry for the long post, but really appreciate any advice or wisdom. 

(One note: I mention seizures a lot here, but they're not epileptic. About a year after they started I realized they weren't like any panic attacks I've had before, and went and saw a neurologist, who found nothing in my MRI or EEG and diagnosed me with ""psychogenic non-epileptic seizures."" She told me they're likely caused by extremely stressful situations, but couldn't prescribe anything beyond CBT therapy. I suspect my nervous system knew moving home was a bad idea and was trying to tell me the only way it had left.)

Today's Pick: **Darius Garland 8+ Asts**

**Score Bet**: **+130**

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.3U

League: Cleveland Cavaliers vs New York Knicks (11AM CST on ABC/ESPN)

**Recap**: Nathan MacKinnon just didn't have it today. He's been such a wagon for me and I'm not disappointed because this guy has been a cash cow for me in so many hot key plays. Avs won this game 1-0 and Connor McJesus and the Oilers did their job (Connor recorded 5+ points that game!). We had a great run on the past 8 POTDs (we went 6-2 on that run) and won the last 3 POTDs! Over +12U won so a 1U loss on the last POTD is miniscule loss, but yea.. parlays/SGPs/SGPx sucks! It's always 1-leg and my lays are always 1-leg L's! Welcome to the SUCK!

**Matchup:** I think it's safe to handicap the Association? Maybe I should go to one of my best bet on the NFL, but I'm taking a chance! X-Mas Day is an NBA day and it always has been. I hate that the NFL is being played on this day, but this isn't a protest it's simply where the value lies and I love the value on this NBA player prop bet in the very first NBA game today between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the New York Knicks! It's not my best bet for my entire betting card, but it's one of my best value wager today (well.. maybe second favorite value, that's still good for me to go 1U).

**Knicks allowed the 9th most apg to their opponents (25.2 apg) and allowed the 2nd most apg to point guards in the league. Knicks also allows 8.02 apg to pg and they have allowed 8 or more Asts three consecutive games to opponent's PG** (8 Asts to Donte DiVicenzo, 8 Asts to Davion Mitchell, 9 Asts to Tyrese Maxey). And not too long ago they allowed 9 Asts to De'Aaron Fox and 12 Asts to Stephon Castle (in the same game).

**Garland has also covered this line in his last 3 games (and 4 of his last 5 games). Garland may average under (6.9 apg) this current line, but** in a game that allows the 2nd most assists  to PG and wit Donovan Mitchell ramping his points, I love this prop bet. **Garland has also covered this line the last time he played the Knicks** (13 Asts on 04/11/25 at MSG)

[Stats provided by Teamrankings.com](https://preview.redd.it/491n1t8hhb9g1.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=8776a1a822a2f7d29ea898ae74ac5cc612bae9d8)

If Mobley plays this game I expect this line to shoot up, but regardless if he plays or not I still love this current line, so much that I almost talked myself to 2U play, but there's a lot of plays I am playing in today's NBA/NFL games, so just 1U play for me.

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on Darius Garland 8+ Asts. Garland records 4 Asts in the 1st quarter and ends wit 5 Asts at halftime. 2nd half he records 3 more Asts.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

1pv9iok,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1pv9iok/i_was_assaulted_by_a_restaurant_in_ao_nang_beach/,"I was assaulted by a restaurant in Ao Nang Beach, Krabi. Need direction on what to do or let it go.","Today, I was having brunch at Restaurant at Ao Nang Beach, Thailand. I arrived at the restaurant at around 12.07pm ordered couple of dishes. The thing was, we had to go back to our hotel at 1 o clock and catch a ferry at Napparat pier at 3 pm. I waited very long at the retaurant and eventually ordered bill for beer and coffee that we had till the time 12.45 pm. (Was supposed to catch tuk tuk back to hotel at 1 pm hence the reason why I wanted to bill out). The waiter, asked us he cannot cancel because it took some time to prepare food. I explained him the situation but he started behaving rudely with me and my wife and said you can't cancel the order as it is being prepared. I said okay whatever was made I will eat quickly and cancel the other item. He agreed, but after 5 minutes he brought the other item and said you have to pay the whole bill and started behaving rudely. I said as per previous discussion I will only pay the amount that I have eaten. 

At this point, I asked for his manager, he said he is the manager. I asked thailand police number, he denied to share that information. So I asked him where the nearest police station was, he pointed me towards it and I started to leave with my wife but he said pay the whole bill or leave your wife at the restaurant. I said no, and asked one of their waiters to come with me to police station because I am not running away with their money. He denied and this is the moment I said stop harassing me and my wife, you can not hold my wife hostage at your restaurant, if you want to come with me to police station I am happy to do that.

This was the point where the assault happened and the waiter held my shirt's collar and pushed me and almost would've hit me if his manager didn't interfere. His manager told me to leave the restaurant which I did.

I went to traffic police stop nearby and explained the situation, they told me that the police station is nearby contact them, I walked towards the direction and asked multiple locals about location of police station and majority of them told me there was no police station that way. I tried calling the helpline numbers but wasn't able to connect due to me having international sim card which of course had international roaming enabled.

Since the time to catch the ferry was approaching fast, I rushed to my hotel (Ibis Styles Ao Nang) and asked them to contact tourist police for me, which they did. After few minutes of waiting the tourist police was at the hotel and I explained the whole situation to them. 

Instead of focusing on the assault, they were majorly concerned whether I paid them in full or not. I told them I was willing to pay for the half amount that I ate but they told me I could've asked for the takeaway and then pay the whole bill. I explained them I am still willing to pay but i need to register the whole incident as a report. I got a response from them it takes a whole to file a report at local police station, and often they give you appointments and you have to go at that specific time register a report and then it takes 2-3 days to look into the issue. They told me since you have your ferry at 3 o clock, it is better to not do anything since restaurant has also not filed a report.

Now I am on my way to phuket on a ferry since I did not have that luxury to wait around in local police station. I want to know what else I can do once I reach Phuket, can I report the assault there? Should I even pursue this or should I let it go? I got a feeling from talking to Tourist police that they wanted us to let it go even when the assault happened to us and top of it the language barrier was consuming too much time.

TLDR : Restaurant waiter assaulted me and my wife, contacted tourist police, they were helpless and suggested us to let it go and get on our ferry and proceed with our trip as if nothing happened. Wondering what else I can do about the assault that happened.

ive been into coffee for a while, i use peculators mostly and have quite a collection. and id like to say ive gotten pretty good at using them. (so does my family who drink the coffee aswell😂)

looking to upgrade to a proper espresso machine using my christmas money this year.

wondering what a good machine would be, so far the sunbeam compact barista is looking to be ok-ish, mostly because its in budget..

sadly i cant really go for second hand as i live in a somewhat rural area, so there isnt much in the market. but if there was something that was around id be happy to take it.

1pv9gy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pv9gy1/advent_calendar_reviews/,Advent Calendar Reviews,"I am a fan of coffee advent calendars: I like going to sleep looking forward to the next days coffees and feel like I learnt a lot of what I know about coffee from advent calendars. Over the last years I tried a few, here are my reviews, to help people decide what to get next year. Please add yours :-)

**19grams 2020-24** The educational speed run of coffee: You get 24 coffees from (currently) all different origins and varied processing, either roasted for filter or espresso from one roaster. Enough beans to try different methods and figure out what you like best with what kind of coffee. Many things didn't work for me, but I learned a lot about what is out there and what I enjoy.

**Onyx 2024** Looked very festive, but was way too darkly roasted for me to taste anything as filter. Apparently most people just make great espresso out of it; unfortunately this didn't come to my mind last year.

**Kaffebox 2025** Twelve nordic roasters, two coffees from each. Beautifully made and all coffees are very pleasant, but it feels like the roasters are all chasing the same Perfect Cup TM for the holiday season (well, the second half has some more adventurous coffees, like an Exelsia from Vietnam and some strongly fermented ones). If you are fascinated by how clean of a honey processed coffee you can get, then this is for you. Otherwise, there are at least enough beans to brew some side-by-side and pick up some of the nuances as a hobbyist.

**Tanat 2025** Elegant calendar (maybe too elegant: the color code for the recipes was so subtle, they had to post an explanation, what was what), showcasing Tanat's delicate style of coffee, like those eight Geshas from Panama. If you like your coffee tea-like and clean, look no further.

**Pirates of Coffee 2025** All about wildly processed coffees. Rather darkly roasted, but I don't mind that in this case; they are varied and funky enough to still be interesting and we drank many as espresso.

1pv9f2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1pv9f2g/lost_as_to_what_to_do_next/,Lost as to what to do next,"At this point in my life I am genuinely lost as to what to do. 

I have been in a relationship with my fiancée for 8 years, engaged for 3. She had two sons (12 and 16) from a previous relationship, and we have a pair of twins that are two and a single baby that is one. 

99% of the time, things seem good. 

1% of the time, my fiancée seems to have a mental breakdown that lasts hours, days, or weeks. I don’t know how to help her, I don’t know how to prevent it, I don’t know how to stop it. Sometimes it’s triggered by events in our lives, holidays are a big trigger for her as she’s obsessed not only with our holidays as being perfect for the children, but being SEEN as perfect as well. 

I’m a pretty laid back person, I have had some troubled relationships in the past but nothing like that. Even my (violent) previous ex was not on this level. I don’t understand what triggers it, but when it happens she goes into a rage there is no talking to her. I can usually feel it coming - like if she is having a bad day and she feels it piling up, she tends to get rougher as the day goes on. But once she is there, it’s far too late. She’s screaming, hitting herself, throwing shit around, breaking things, etc. When she’s like this she will send long diatribes via text, but won’t talk to me in person. The texts are overwhelming, I’m talking scrolling for several minutes. And if I don’t respond fast enough it gets worse. If I stop responding or block or, or worst of all
Leave the house - she will tell me to “stay gone” and that I have abandoned her, and generally threatens to kill herself at some point. 

Police have been involved several times - one time in particular after the twins were born. She was going through postpartum depression and I ended up having to call the cops on her. The older boys have seen this an unfortunate amount of times, and they’re very aware that their mother sometimes struggles with mental health. Not to say that they understand it, but I don’t understand it either. Suffice to say that she doesn’t seem to be able regulate her emotions, and it doesn’t take much to get her from A to Z if she’s having a bad day. 

Today was Christmas Eve. We have been tired the last few days as we have a lot on our plates with presents and childcare and everything else, but still this day didn’t have the normal “indicators” of an episode. We were both in good spirits, getting the house ready for tomorrow, we had coffee, breakfast and energy drinks and were getting some things that had slipped through the cracks like wrapping paper.

This changed when we got home. She kicked me out of the bedroom to wrap presents (she didn’t want and REFUSES to ask for help) while I took care of the children. 

I got dinner, got the babies up from their nap, etc. fed the babies, got them ready for bed, took the twins to their room and got them settled in. Everything still seems normal. She was still seemingly in a good mood, and I had the single baby out with me since she still sleeps in our bedroom. We had been discussing the older boys coming home from church at 8pm and not having had dinner. She said she was exhausted and irritated, and I said the boys were old enough to get their dinner situated. She agreed. 

A little while later, I texted asked how she was doing. She replied with “I’d like to die now, thanks.” I asked her if I could do anything to help, and she declined me. I then got “I’d like to die now, thanks,” again - followed by a “I hate EVERYTHING.” I asked her what was going on but received no response. I went to our bedroom door and could hear her cussing and throwing things around. The door was locked, and I asked her to unlock it. She did not respond but continued to swear and throw things around. 

I asked her to unlock the door and she told me to leave her alone. I walked back to the body and texted my fiancée asking what was going on. I asked her to stop throwing and screaming things, which she did not do. She told me to fuck off instead. She was getting ready to go off, so I blocked her. 

By this point, it was well past the one year olds bed time but she was still wide awake, with no crib available. With her mom screaming her head off, I took the baby for a short drive as she always falls asleep in the car. 

I drove into one of the neighborhoods that has a lot of Christmas lights and displays an just cruised for 10 or 15 minutes. It was this point I received a Facebook message from her telling me to stay gone, and not come back. I asked her why she was acting this way, and told her I had only left the house to get the baby to sleep and that I would be back soon. 

In my absence, she locked every door in the house - which we generally do not do when someone is out - including the interior garage door and the back door. This was a message. Considering I still had a sleeping baby in tow, I asked one of the boys to unlock the front door. He did, and I got the baby situated with some lullabies and a blanket. 

At that point, I went to go talk to my fiancée.

I admit, I lost my cool. I told her that the next time she locked me out of the house (she knows this gets to me) that we were going to be done, and that I was not happy with the way she was acting. I asked her repeatedly why she was acting like this, and once again she flew into a rage. She started throwing presents around, at me, and punched me in the chest yelling “Hit me, HIT ME.” A lot of pointed words were said, neither of us accounted well for ourselves.   Long story short, I told her she needed help and that her behavior was wildly unacceptable. I left the room, and she went back to screaming at the walls. 

An hour or so later she (seemingly calm) took the one year old and put her to bed. But as soon as she was out of my sight she was still yelling through the walls. Fortunately, this little baby sleeps through most sound. 

It’s now 12:30AM on Christmas Day, and I am utterly hopeless, alone, and out of ideas. I don’t know how to live with this. I don’t know how to deal with a woman who seemingly randomly loses her marbles. This one was bad, and I never know where to go from there. She screams at me to leaver her alone, and then gets pissed and tells me I don’t care about her after she’s pushed me away. 

Our children are wonderful, the absolute light in my life. Fatherhood was one of my greatest joys. And normally my Fiancee’s wonderful too. An empathetic woman who loves our babies, loves being home to raise them, smart, funny, etc. 

These episodes kill me, because I never know where it’s going to go. Like I mentioned, I have called the police before and I genuinely considered doing so tonight. 

I’m terrified of what happens to our babies if we split. She hasn’t worked in several years, and the cost of childcare being what it is, we decided it wasn’t worth it to try to both work and have someone else raise our babies. That also means we’re a single income family. If we split, we have to move out of the house we’re in. I can’t support two households, and I worry greatly about what the added financial stress will do to her mental health  and what that means for our children. 

We’re not wealthy. I can’t afford to lose my job, or take much time off work. While salary, I am expected to be in office every day. We also live in an expensive city and if I take a different job to be with my kids, I can’t afford to live in a safe part of town or with people I trust. I don’t have a support structure, my parents died in the last several years and my sister and brother live thousands of miles away. 

It’s 12:44 now, and it seems to have quieted down a little. Despite what you might think, this is usually not a good sign. 

I can’t leave because of my children, but I can’t keep doing this because it fucks with my mental health and I don’t know what she’s willing to do to “keep” the children. The police / hospitals are worthless - she once was willing to admit she needed help, we spent nearly 7 hours in an ER without seeing anyone. When previously suicidal, the cops were unwilling to help or took her at her word when she said she was fine. I’ve wrestled sharp objects out of her hands more than I care to relay. 

I’m lost, alone, and tired. I’m hoping she crashes and falls asleep so that I can sleep, and tomorrow things might be different. I’m not sure how much longer I can keep doing this. My own physical and mental health are at an all time low. 

I will probably delete this in the morning. Thank you for listening if you’ve made it this far. Good night, and merry Christmas.

Hi, need some unbiased advice because my friends would just tell me to break it off with him. My bf and I are closing into a year now, we've celebrated our birthdays and spent an early Christmas weekend together. Both of which he didn't get me anything. Gift-giving is not my main love language, it's more of the principle of ""hey, I thought of you"" or ""this reminded me of you"" that | like. He used to be very thoughtful, get me surprise flowers or ask to come see me kahit mas mahaba pa yung biyahe kaysa sa actual hangout, gagawin niya. 

And yes, I got him gifts for both occasions and ones he actually wants to have. I'm never empty-handed whenever we do see each other (madalang na meet kasi busy na siya sa work ff a promotion, I understand that), always have some form of coffee, food he likes, or a thoughtful gift ""just because"". But he got himself a new high-end wallet and a PS5 for Christmas, maybe new car parts he stopped telling me about. Para sakin ok lang naman, pera niya yun and he works hard + has odd hours.
All I got from him this Christmas a text around midnight. ""Merry Christmas!! Love you"" with a kiss face emoji after ignoring the other texts I sent above it. For context, he spent the entire day helping his tamily set up for the holidays and receive all his cousins. I understand holidays are hectic and he came straight from night shift but I'm feeling left out during a day like this. Siguro naman may karapatan ako kasi parte naman ako ng buhay niya 😂

If it helps, we both came from long-term relationships (and ample time of 'singleness' before we started talking and officially dated) so kung ganun... hindi na dapat bago to diba? Kahit papano naman may gamay ka na sa ganyan. OA lang ba ako at mataas expectations?

The title might be a bit of an exaggeration, but after wearing this Daytona for a few months, I'm genuinely rethinking the concept of ""value.""

It's not a collector's item hidden away in a safe, but a tool and accessory that truly integrates into daily life. The solid feel of the Oystersteel, the scratch resistance of the ceramic bezel, and its perfect presence whether in a boardroom or a coffee shop – that's the power of classic design. The details speak for themselves (hopefully the photos convey some of this).

Recently, due to personal plans, I'm streamlining my collection. This has made me realize that the effort I put into finding it initially, and now considering letting it find its next appreciative owner, are both part of this watch's story.

If you've also been searching for a Daytona in perfect condition that seamlessly integrates into your life and elevates the quality of every day, perhaps we can talk. It's waiting for a wrist that understands it just as well.

One important discovery: When you view it from the perspective of ""legacy"" rather than ""hoarding,"" the means and conditions of acquiring it might be more within reach than you think.

For the past two years, I have been caring for my terminally ill child. The last year has been particularly challenging, as my kid has lost 90% of his mobility. He can currently only use his right arm and requires extensive care (help with just about everything) and 24-hour entertainment. I adore him and try to cherish every moment we have, but the truth is that I am too depleted to be carrying this kind of weight by myself.

Things culminated a few weeks ago. I went to a kids’ event with friends, where I met a man. During that day, I caught myself laughing with delight at some of his jokes, then him laughing at some of mine. Conversations with him flowed in such a natural way. The fact that he was very kind to my son surely played a role too, compared to many other people who cannot even bear the sight of a severely disabled kid. Then there was the hug when the event ended and we parted ways. Damn, that hug of his felt so good, like hot chocolate melting all over my body. How sweet, I thought to myself, despite all the shit I’ve been through, my heart is still beating. 

We exchanged phone numbers and agreed to stay in touch. It took me two weeks to find the courage to write to him, he was happy to hear from me and then we agreed to go on a hike together. It seemed to go well. We had lots of thoughtful conversations; he seemed like such a kind and emotionally mature person. The attraction was there. It felt so nice to spend time with him, to feel excited about stepping out of my caregiving role and getting to know him slowly.

After the hike, he stayed in closer touch, writing more regularly, checking in, sending kiss emojis, and saying that he would really like to see me again. Damn… I had forgotten what it feels like to be WANTED by someone, and to WANT someone. We agreed to do a second hike. The sweet message exchanges continued for a few days. Then he slowly started fading.

First, there were fewer “kisses” at the end of messages and less of “I can’t wait to see you.” Then his response time started increasing, from replying within 30–60 minutes to replying within 10–12 hours. I assumed he must be busy and didn’t push the conversation; I wanted to give him space. After all, nothing bad had happened… we were still set to meet soon.

Then, two days before the hike, I asked what time we would meet. We had agreed on the morning but hadn’t set a time yet. After 12 hours of silence, his answer came: he had done a lot of Pilates and needed to rest, so we should schedule the hike for another day. This felt like a major shift from “I can’t wait to see you.”

It also pissed the hell out of me, because I had to put a lot of effort into finding someone who could care for my son… to be able to meet him. And now he’s just cancelling because pilates was too exhausting. Really. Couldn’t he have suggested something calmer instead? Like just meeting for coffee or in a park? This makes me so angry on so many levels. Does this person even know what it means to feel exhausted? To put your life on hold for two years? To live day by day while your child is slowly, painfully dying?

But I know what “I’m tired, let’s schedule another day” means, when there is no concrete suggestion. He’s not the first man I’ve tried to date while going through this fucked-up never-ending crisis situation. He’s not the first man to suddenly give me the cold shoulder. I am used to it, being ghosted. But I don’t know why, somehow, this time it hurt a lot more.

Maybe because I felt, somehow he is more mature and patient than most people. And had a flicker of hope, that he would dare to stand by my side. Maybe because I am so exhausted. Maybe because I am desperately craving a shoulder to lay my head on, even if only for a brief glimpse. Maybe because my need to be wanted by someone is beyond unmet. And when he said, “I’d really like to see you,” he opened a can of emotions that would have been better left sealed. I feel so lonely and unwanted.",4,1766652656.0,CaregiverSupport,1,0.84,False

I’m looking to meet up with new people visiting or living in London. I’m here for few weeks I always travel to London for winter holidays specially cuz I love Christmas vibes.

With that being said it would be nice to go try new coffee places like cafe at the Ned then walk around and enjoy the view from sky garden and maybe go for some shopping (if people wish to do so)!

Also introducing myself, I’m 27M living in one of the gulf countries, I love coming to central London and just strolling around and doing different thing usually I have friends here also visiting but this time I’m solo. I’m usually social and make friends on streets but this time I wanted to try Reddit. I can talk all day about topics like history, politics and economics.

So either today on Christmas or 26/12/2025

Start coffee at the Ned around 2-3pm

Go to f1 arcade around 4 pm

Portobello market around 6 pm

Soho in the evening to try out dinner place

Also, the banners do not look great for the Youtube row.

So I don't get much from the Google TV experience and in South Africa, I find it a downgrade from the older Android TV launcher.

So I bought the Acer AITV Google TV box (2gb ram, 32gb storage, S905X5M processor) with Android 14 on it.

[Front \/ Top view of Acer AITV Google TV Box](https://preview.redd.it/j9hnx5f69b9g1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97ad8286066fd07b9e56cd92e7405e56ccaaa52c)

So I used Launcher Manager to disable Google TV's launcher and replace it with Projectivy as my default launcher

[Launcher Manager disabled Google TV Launcher and makes Projectivy Launcher my default home launcher instead](https://preview.redd.it/95c4ycmn8b9g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=efa58616d3b7b18b1082e0936e8a3cc118ad6263)

When you disable Google TV launcher, you also will have Google Home panel AND Google Search Results Panel disabled, so I don't use those on this converted Android TV 14 Box. Maybe one day Google will make Google Home Panel and Google Search Results Panel their own separate apps on Google TV instead of it being part of the Google TV launcher, then I will get those 2 features on my Android TV 14 experience.

I also use TVQuickActions to remap the buttons on the controller:

* Star button opens my Custom Actions Side Menu
* Settings button opens the Google TV settings
* Profile Switcher button opens the Account settings page
* Guide button opens a bottom app dock
* Live TV button opens DSTV app
* Channel UP / Down buttons switch to previous apps
* Youtube / Netflix / Prime / Youtube Music buttons open a diamond menu with the respective app in the middle of the diamond and quick actions around the diamond

All of the above means that I have a launcher now that isn't linked to any particular user or google account and just a list of apps, and when I open an app, the user profile is chosen within the app. Even the latest Youtube for Android TV app doesn't tie itself to the Google Launcher profile switcher anymore, making it a much better experience. Also, Google Cast and Ambient Screensaver are all detached from the launcher app now, so those work fine too.

I showed her the app starwalk and after a while she started to talk about her life... 

She was a Stewardess for Alitalia '69-'71 and later for Lufthansa & Condor '71-'75. 

A pilot shortly before retirement at Alitalia spilled his heart out, he saw so much that he can't talk about. And she talked to other pilots over the years and they said similar, don't speak about sightings or you lose your credibility and your job. 

The two of us hardly talk about aliens and what could be, or what possible are there within all the plausible theories, yesterday we did...

then she triggered memories... 

->Conversation summary:
Mom: do you remember the one time,... ah no you had moved out already... your sister was there... it was in the morning I think somewhere between 8-10am, Nadine was just awake, Summer Holliday's 1994... and she was drinking her coffee bowl outside on the terrace. 

Nadine called me outside. And then we saw it, some metallic long shaped object and two fighters planes guiding it just flying over the village at a hight of 100-200m. The two planes left and right next to it, some silver coloured object, flying together in sinc... and as we were standing there in awe, the UFO dropped out of the formation and made a radical movement and was gone within a few seconds, it just raced off. 

The plans had to make a big curve to follow it, but the UFO already disappeared at the horizon...<-

I personally haven't thought about the story for at least 30 years, I had different things going on in my life at that time. But I could remember them telling me about it, and that it was a hot Story in the small village at that time, because the two were not alone in seeing this incident.

No pictures, and it didn't find its way into the local newspaper, to abstract for a German newspaper... but it's a 'remember the time there was a UFO over Worpswede' story in the community.

1pv8tcj,https://i.redd.it/h8zxrd7h8b9g1.jpeg,Reviews of the Fragrances I own (#5),"Here I am, this time with my last Smytten haul (and the only time I’ve ever seen TDH on there). Again, just like my previous posts, I haven’t tried any designers or niche perfumes yet, so I won’t be comparing these with anything - just my nose and my thoughts coming together to explain the scent profile and the performance in the best way possible.

This has a lot of different fragrances so this will be a pretty long post. Sit back, relax, take your time while you read these out. Here we go:

# 1. Bella Vita CEO Man (5/10):

Got this one mainly because I had 1 trial point left, and nothing else seemed worth it. Surprisingly a good one from the brand. Opens up with a mild alcohol blast, then becomes fruity with mango being the most prominent note. It’s like the Mango Bite toffee we used to get a few years ago (sweet, sticky), fairly linear with a slightly woody dry down. It’s pleasant and I’d have rated it at least a 7 if only it lasted for a longer time. This won’t make you nose blind, but it has the same problem as most of the BV fragrances- longevity is poor, and abysmal on the skin. You can barely smell it on your wrist even with your nose dug into it after an hour or so.

*Projection- Around 20–25 mins*  
*Longevity- Approx. 3.5–4ish hours (weak)*

# 2. Lone Wolf White Fang (2/10):

So, this brand was constantly being shoved into my face whenever I used to go to the Trials section. 3 ml for 1 point was decent enough, but then they gave out 2×3 ml combos for 1 point, so I had to get these 4. They’re priced in the 1500–2500 range so you’re probably better off getting MEs.

White Fang by far is my least favorite of the bunch. You get an extremely loud alcohol blast that goes straight up your nose, and it stays on for quite a while. Even when it goes away, you can still figure out that it’s too synthetic—enough to give you a mild headache since it constantly keeps getting in your nose. Coming to the scent profile (or at least what I could figure out), the citrus, fresh and floral notes are not blended well imo, and this is not something I’d suggest anyone to even try.

*Projection- Around 30 mins (most of it being the alcohol blast)*  
*Longevity- Approx. 3ish hours*

# 3. Lone Wolf Lucifer (4/10):

This is a decent leather fragrance that will somewhat remind you of Beardo Whiskey Smoke Bourbon (the only leather cheapie I own). The low rating may also be due to my less affinity towards leather as a note, so you can try it out for once.

This one opens with a milder alcohol blast, and slowly you start getting slightly bitter whiffs, and then the leather comes up. The official notes mentioned are amber, raspberry, suede leather, jasmine (so ig they tried to clone TF Tuscan Leather?), but the leather is the most prominent. As you move towards the dry down, you start getting a sweet smell along with the leather which actually makes it smell better, and I believe comes from the amber note in it. Longevity is an issue and you’ll get better options for this scent profile in this, or even lower price range. Has a cool bottle though.

*Projection- Around 30–40 mins*  
*Longevity- Around 4 hours*

# 4. Lone Wolf Black (5.5/10):

Now this was the first LW that I actually liked. It’s more suited for the Oct–Nov weather, when it’s not too hot nor too cold. Opens with a nice coconut note, slightly fresh. This is the only fragrance I’ve liked so far with a coconut note (which didn’t give me the oily vibe). With some time, some sweetness comes in slowly, which blends with the coconut and as you move further towards the dry down, you start noticing some leathery and tobacco notes. I believe this has been blended decently enough to not let the bitter notes take over. I know I mentioned leather not being my preferred note, but I could actually find myself liking it in this fragrance. Definitely a masculine one. Again, performance is not the best for this price.

*Projection- Around 30 mins of weak projection*  
*Longevity- Not more than 4 hours*

# 5. Lone Wolf Rebellion (7/10):

My favorite fragrance from this brand, rated a bit low due to performance issues and the higher price. The full bottle gives off Guerlain L’Homme Ideal Extreme vibes (only the bottle though :p). Scent profile wise, this smells amazing even though it’s a fairly linear scent. Has an airy vibe around it as it opens with some citrus notes. The top notes wear off pretty quickly, and the vetiver comes out. Once that happens, you’ll see that it maintains this scent for the rest of the time it’s on.

I’m into vetiver based fragrances, so I liked it a lot—even more so because it’s an airy kind of vetiver and not the dark one (like the one I’ll mention later in this post). I know this might be a bit of a stretch, but for now this is one of my favorite vetiver based fragrances. If the longevity had been a LITTLE better, I could’ve gone for a full bottle even.

*Projection- Around 30 mins (weak)*  
*Longevity- Approx. 3ish hours*

# 6. Titan Skinn Raw (8/10):

Read a lot of good things about this on Reddit and YouTube. Everyone seems to suggest it whenever we talk about freshies with good quality. I feel like the hype is somewhat justified. This is fresh, and will work as a really good daily driver during the summers. Opens with a nice fresh, slightly citrusy vibe, moves towards a slightly white floral mid and then keeps on giving you those fresh whiffs every now and then.

Initially when I sprayed it, it didn’t seem anything special. But 2–3 weeks after getting it, it started showing some metallic characteristics, and that was working really well with the overall fresh profile—I liked it a lot. I even got a compliment from a guy in the office, he said that it will go really well in summers when you’re wearing a suit or crisp formals. Longevity is decent for a freshie, although you’ll have to top it up in the second half of your workday.

*Projection- Almost 1 hour of decent projection*  
*Longevity- Around 5ish hours*

# 7. Titan Skinn Verge (5.5/10):

Again, good reviews online. But unlike Raw, it didn’t appeal to me that much. It’s a decent mass pleasing scent—I’ll give it that. But it’s more of a personal opinion rather than a generalized one.

This opens with a mild spicy note, fresh too. As time passes by, you can feel a sweetness coming up, which is almost bubblegummy sweet. It does go up the nose a bit, since it has that barbershoppy aspect to it as well, but only in the air not on the skin. I’d say it’s somewhere between a mild Dior Sauvage, and a less sweet Rasasi Hawas. You can think of it like this—take Hawas, tone down the sweetness a bit, add some mild spices—you get Verge. Overall the profile is a bit linear. What I didn’t like was that it gave some “stale” vibes (idk how to explain this), maybe it’s due to the oakmoss? Idk.

*Projection- Around 40 mins (weak)*  
*Longevity- Around 4–4.5 hours max*

# 8. Titan Skinn Amalfi Bleu (5.5/10):

I’d read a lot of positive reviews about this on Reddit, so when I got the discovery set, I was pretty excited to try this one out. But I was really disappointed because to my nose, this was just a generic aquatic freshie with not a lot of depth. People might like it because of how safe it is to pull off, but that’s just it. It’s a safe scent—that’s all.

It opens with a fresh, aquatic, mild citrus note, and slowly a VERY faint metallic nuance creeps in. I know this sounds the same as Raw, but trust me, it isn’t. Not in the least. As it reaches the drydown, some musk comes out which keeps giving you whiffs every few minutes, so projection is decent. On its own, it isn’t much special for me, but I have a feeling that you can overspray this, and then do a couple of sprays of YSL Y DNA to make this an easy 7.5–8/10 scent profile.

*Projection- Around 45 mins (weak)*  
*Longevity- At most 4 hours*

# 9. Titan Skinn Country Road (9/10):

This might be my favorite from the whole Titan discovery set. I like this even more than Raw for summers, and I really REALLY wish they had 20 ml bottles for Country Road too. They don’t know how much market they’re missing out on by not having smaller bottles for Country Road and Mediterranean Grove (tried it once at a friend’s house).

The first time I opened it and sprayed in the air (I always do the first one in the air to see the mist), I smelled it and immediately went “OOH THIS IS GOOD!”. I haven’t said this for a lot of fragrances on the first go in my limited experience, so you know how good this was for me right off the bat.

This is aquatic, slightly sweet (maybe from the tonka?) in the drydown and a little musky too. The use of red apple instead of the green one, gave it that edge which I was not expecting from a freshie. This isn’t something you’ll go nose blind to, and the whiffs will keep coming for quite some time too.

*Projection- Around an hour or so*  
*Longevity- Can go 5–5.5 hours easily (gets weaker in the latter half)*

# 10. Titan Skinn Steel (8/10):

Now this is the darkest of the lot. This is a “grown man” fragrance, and I feel like you have to be a little mature to enjoy it more. A bit difficult to understand as well, since Skinn typically uses notes you may not even have heard of.

This opens with a relatively darker citrus top, and slowly starts becoming spicy. The base is sweet (they mentioned praline and tonka in the base notes sooo), and a little heavy—so you know this will be a good winter scent too. For me, Steel is to winters what Raw is to summers—a formal, suited up fragrance that is made to catch attention.

It’s more of a personal preference, and I don’t think it’s a mass pleasing scent profile because I’ve never gotten any compliments from this. Projection is really loud in the first 30 minutes and you’ll keep getting pleasant whiffs for a much longer time.

*Projection- Around 60–75 minutes*  
*Longevity- Almost 7–7.5 hours (lasts almost the whole workday for me)*

# 11. Terre d’Hermès Eau Intense Vetiver (8.5/10):

I like vetiver as a prominent note, so you know I had to get this as soon as it was available on Smytten (all hail Smytten!). I did it once, I’ll do it again and again. You can say this was my first ever designer (?) and the quality difference between this and the clones is so damn obvious.

This has no alcohol blast whatsoever, and opens with a really nice citrus top which is fresh and bright. The vetiver comes in fairly early and blends in really well with the citrusy top notes too. From here on, it’s all about the hero note—a little mature, grown up vibe.

It will work as a very nice daily wear during the humid weather. The projection is pretty good too. I know this because another guy in my office wears this, and every time I walk past his cabin, I get strong whiffs even if his door is closed. This is not a scent profile that will get you compliments from girls though—it’s like getting jacked and then being the center of attention of guys who start looking up to you.

*Projection- Around 1.5–2 hours (based on the whiffs I get from the office guy)*  
*Longevity- Easily 7–8 hours (Intense Vetiver is EDP while TDH is EDT, hence the better longevity)*

# 12. Lalique Encre Noir (7/10):

Okay here’s a little fuck up from Smytten—I saw Encre Noir Sport on the app, and ordered that with the rest of my stuff. I wanted to try it because I’d heard it’s a bit more playful and lighter than the OG. But somehow they sent me Encre Noir instead, and this seemed to have happened with a lot of guys back then.

Nevertheless, I got to try this DNA and even though I didn’t like it as much as I think I’d have liked Sport, it’s still a pretty good vetiver based fragrance from the Encre Noir line. I’ll definitely try a decant of Sport at some later point of time.

This one is more vetiver forward, but this time the vetiver is darker, more mature, a bit heavier (?), and more intense than TDH. I didn’t like it the first time I sprayed it, but as I kept on trying it out more, it grew on me. Again, this is something you’d wear for yourself and not for compliments.

*Projection- About 45 minutes*  
*Longevity- Somewhere between 5–6 hours*

# 13. Wild Stone Code Terra (8/10):

When I said I liked vetiver as a note, I also meant it being a bit airy, and a bit brighter. TDH scratches that itch well for me, but it’s too pricey for now. WS Terra is done really well—the price at which they’re offering it, and the closeness to the OG, I’d say this is punching above its weight.

If I’m getting 70–75% of the brightness and quality of the OG at roughly 500–600, I’ll definitely go for it. This is more citrusy in the opening, a bit more suited for the younger users, and once the vetiver comes in… I just keep smelling it over and over.

This is a bit less personal, and something other guys will like smelling when you walk into the room. A little mass pleasing aspect here with the extra citrus, and the projection is really good too. The biggest USP, again, is the price point. Definitely a good choice if you want to experience the DNA but are on a limited budget.

*Projection- Almost an hour*  
*Longevity- Lasts for around 5–6 hours on my clothes*

**---END---**

Sooo that’s all for today. This is my second time writing this post from scratch because my laptop went off after the 8th point 😭. Thankfully Good Keep has a version history so I could refer to my write-ups again for the reviews.

I hope you liked reading them, and if you were thinking of buying any of these, your confusions were somewhat cleared :)

We’ll meet next time with some more fragrances. I got 3 from Arabian Aroma, 4 from Menworks (5 including the free sample), and a bunch of decants which I’m excited to test out. I’m also planning to get the Revelation set by Ababel just to try out that Imagination and Megamare DNA. Do let me know what I should do next :)

**Edit:** Oh, before I go, can anyone tell me where I can get Al Rehab attars from? I have Choco Musk currently and now I wanna try French Coffee but the sites I was referring to have it out of stock. I’ll be getting 2 more in addition to FC sooo another review material? 👀

	•	I compare £/100g in supermarkets. I don’t always buy the cheapest, I still check ingredients, but I’m definitely doing the maths.

	•	I shop around for fuel and plan journeys so I hit the cheapest station on the way there or back.

	•	I avoid spending money in coffee shops, museums, corner shops etc like the plague because it just feels like being mugged off.

	•	I avoid paying for parking and choose free spots even if it means walking 20 mins and justify by was saying it's good exercise lmao. Again some places charge like £1.20 or even more an hour and it just feels like a waste.


That said, I still spend money on things I actually enjoy:

	•	museums

	•	theme parks with the kids

	•	cinema with the kids

	•	bowling.  although fuck the food and drinks. And it’s not just the price. If it was genuinely good, I’d probably pay. I’m just not paying £12 for some frozen Costco type rubbish.

Honestly, the more I think about it, I don’t even think price is the main issue anymore. It’s that everything feels enshitified, but still priced like it’s premium.

So now I'm also thinking I may not need much for retirement at this rate lol. Anyone else had the same ""struggle"". How do I get out of this mentality? Ive heard all the ""you can't take your money with you when you die"" but that never really helps and is similar to ""I could get hit by a bus tomorrow"". ",10,1766650716.0,FIREUK,42,0.71,False
