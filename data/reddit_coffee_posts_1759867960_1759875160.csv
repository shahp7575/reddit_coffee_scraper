i am powerful. i am enlightened . i am just and righteous. i am always right. and if it turns out i wasn’t 100% right, i graciously update my worldview and forgive myself for my ignorance, and everyone sees how readily i learn and change and forgives me for ever being wrong too.

i have soft skin, and my salivary glands produce copious liquid, so i never make weird mouth sounds when i talk (and i can always easily hawk tuah if you catch my drift). i have no hatred in my heart or cancinogenic air in my lungs.

i am american and free. i invested in the stock market, but in a chic and anti capitalist way. the arches if my feet are high and curved. i like coffee and tea equally and don’t look down on anyone for liking frapachinos. i do not donate to charity because i know it is a scam.

i can differentiate different species of woodpeckers by the pace at which they peck wood. one vial of my semen would be as valuable as a racehorse’s — if i was a horse and also male. but i am female, which is better than being male.

i am thinking of milking my sweat glands (which are as engorged as my virile salivary glands) and distilling the phermones of my sweat for perfume so that the poor, unwashed masses can imitate my greatness by smelling somewhat like me. this is a great business idea bc i could make four seperate perfumes for each quarter of my cycle. four times the perfumes. four times the money. 

i am a genius.

I noticed the street adjacent to where I parked had a paid parking sign however the street I parked on had no parking signs or pay meters. I walked up and down the entire street to confirm this. About a month later I received a letter in the mail with a $70 parking ticket. I disputed the fine online and they just came back with this determination:

“Auckland Transport implemented a paid parking zone parking area within AUCKLAND
CENTRAL. The placement of signage for zone parking is different to the placement of signs for a linear parking restriction.
Zone parking restrictions only require signage to be placed at the entry and exit points to
stipulate the zone, repeater signs are then placed at no more than 200m.”

I think this is ridiculous as how is anyone supposed to know about this ‘zone parking’ when the street you parked on has no signage, and the signs on the adjacent street never mentioned anything about it either? 

I understand that ignorance is no excuse for breaking the law, but I feel in these kinds of cases it is on the council to make this information accessible to the public by way of better signage.  

Along with the determination letter I just received regarding the dispute, they sent a form to apply for a court hearing. I know it’s only $70 but times are tough and on the principle of the matter I wonder how many others have been misled into parking where they thought was safe and then stung with a fine way out of proportion to the ‘offending’. Has anyone had success going to court over a parking fine? Would it be worth it or should I just suck it up as a very expensive coffee date and just pay the $70?",3,1759874260.0,newzealand,5,0.8,False

1o0sjzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o0sjzm/this_isnt_my_dog_part_1/,This Isn't My Dog (Part 1),"Hello.  I’m not sure whether this is the place to put this story, but reading through some of the other posts here, I think you all could help me.

As the title suggests, I don’t think the dog in my house is mine.  This isn’t a case of mistaking my pet for another, Lucy looks exactly like how she left.  However, that’s the problem.  I’ll do my best to relay the story to you with as much detail as I can.

My name is Ellice and I’m married to my husband, Mahesh.  We have one son, Lucius and we have our dog, Lucy.  Rather, we had Lucy.  Honestly, I don’t know what it is at this point.

I still remember the day we got her.  She was a present for Lucius’ fifth birthday.  A few months old, soft, labrador retriever with golden fur, the brightest hazel eyes, and the cutest squeaky bark.  “A puppy!” I remember him exclaiming.  “You got me a puppy!”  He jumped up and down, his green eyes locked on her.

“Yes we did, Lu,” Mahesh said, petting her fur.  “Me and your mom decided we wanted a new addition to the family.”  I’m not even sure if Lucius heard his father, as he ran to her and started petting her.  She immediately warmed up to him, licking him all over his face.

“What do you want to name her?” I asked him while going to hug Mahesh.  “I can name her?” he said, grinning from ear to ear.  “Of course,” I responded.  “She’s your present.”

He stayed there petting her for a while before speaking up.  “Lucius!  I want to name her me!”  Mahesh and I laughed.  “Lu, your name is for boys.  She’s a girl.”  He looked defeated and pouted.  “What about…” Mahesh began.  “Lucy?”  

He looked up at us.  “Is that the girl version?”  “Yep.” I answered, actually unsure.  “She’s Lucy then!” he exclaimed, embracing her.

We loved her.  She was such a sweet puppy, always playing with us and laying on the couch whenever we would watch movies.  Lucius took the most charge by feeding her, taking her on walks with us, even helping to potty train her.  She was a major part of our family.

Unfortunately, I also remember the day that would start this whole mess.  It was two months after we got her.  I was sitting on the couch reading a book as Lucius just went outside to play with Lucy.  “Momma!” Lucius screamed.  I jolted up as he ran to the door.

He was sobbing uncontrollably and fell into my arms.  “What’s going on, baby?” I asked, brushing his black hair from his tear stained face.  He barely managed to get any words out.  “Lu-Lu-Lucy… she’s not o-outside!”

I wiped tears from his now dull green eyes.  “It’s okay, Lu,” I began, looking at him.  “Let’s go look for her together.”  He nodded, still crying.

We searched the back and front yards inside and out.  There wasn’t even a single strand of fur we could find.  Eventually, we went to ask neighbors.  Sadly, they hadn’t seen her but told us they’d spread the word and keep an eye out.  With every house that had no clue as to her whereabouts, Lucius’ face grew more pale and I could tell he was giving up hope.

I walked back, hand in hand with Lucius.  He sniffled here and there, his face covered in tears.  “Why did she run away, Momma?” he asked, staring at the ground while avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk with his tiny feet.  I stayed silent for a bit before answering, “I’m not sure, baby.”

I heard him whimper and I kneeled down.  Gently grasping his shoulders, I looked him in his eyes and wiped some tears away.  “My sweet baby boy,” I began, brushing his hair with my fingers.  “It’ll be alright.  Some puppies like Lucy will find their way home.”

“What about the puppies who don’t?” he questioned with pleading eyes.  I smiled and said the first thing that came to mind, “Then there’s a big park full of warm grass, bones, and other dogs.”  He wiped his nose and asked, “Is there plenty of salty tuna for Lucy?”  “Of course there is.”  He displayed a slight smile and I brought him in for an embrace.

“Are you tired, Lu?” I asked when I pulled away.  “A little,” he responded, his voice barely audible.  “Come here,” I said with a smile, opening my arms again.  “I’ll carry you back home.”

Mahesh came home soon after and I told him what happened.  “Aw damn,” he said, scratching the back of his neck.  “I can go talk to him and try to explain it.”  “Maybe not,” I began, staring at the ground while gnawing at my lip.  “I told him that if Lucy doesn’t come back, she’ll go to a magical dog park.”

We chuckled together, also in an attempt to cheer ourselves up.  “Anything to cheer him up, I suppose,” he stated, still laughing.  “Alright then, I’ll explain it when he’s older.”  He kissed me before wrapping his arms around my waist.  I hugged him back, burying my face in his chest.  For a long while we stood there in silence, mourning our loss.

That month was hard.  I can’t remember seeing Lucius smile a single time.  He often cried for Lucy at night, a light sound that would wake me up.  I remember one night in particular when I went to check up on him.

“Hey, Lu,” I began in the sweetest voice I could muster.  “Do you want to sleep with Dada and I tonight?”

He didn’t respond and continued to cry.  I sat on his bed and combed his soft hair gently with my hand.  Through muffled sobs, I heard him say, “Lucy’s in pain, Momma.  She’s hurt.”  I pulled my hand back, confused.

“What do you mean, Lucius?” I asked.  He seemed to not hear me and stayed crying.  I stayed in his room until his cries became soft snores.  I asked him about it the following morning, but he seemed to have no recollection of it happening.

Later, he also started excluding himself from activities at school.  After a couple of months, it got so bad to the point I got a call from his teacher, so I had a meeting with her.  

“This is a bit strange for children his age,” she began, her expression filled with worry.  “His behavior is odd, as most kids calm down their worries by this point.”  “I’m aware,” I replied, looking down at the table, the sinking feeling of failure building in my stomach.  “My husband and I are doing everything we can, but he was just so attached to Lucy.”

She smiled, “I know how hard it can be.  I raised four little rascals of my own, and it was always difficult when we lost pets.”  I gave her a small smile in response and straightened my posture, the parental pressure easing.

“I’ll help him out in class more and see if I can offer some extra support,” she continued with a bright grin.  “Just focus on helping him get through it at home.”

“Thank you so much, Mrs. Janson.” I remarked, feeling as if a weight was lifted off of my chest.  “We will continue to do so.”  My eyes unconsciously traveled to look at the table as I debated speaking about the night of Lucius’ strange comment from a while ago.

“Mrs. Iyer?” she spoke up, catching my attention.  “Is everything alright?”  “Y-yeah,” I stuttered, gaining my composure.  I fidgeted with the hem of my sleeve before asking, “Has Lucius ever said anything strange about Lucy?”

She looked at me confused, “Like her behavior before you lost her?”  I shook my head.  “No, like if he can tell she feels things.  He mentioned a while ago that she was in pain, but he doesn’t remember telling me that.”

She displayed a look of surprise.  “That is very weird.  He’s never said anything even remotely like that here.”  I slouched in my seat in defeat, thinking I must’ve sounded insane.

“I’ll keep an open ear.” she responded, a slight smile appearing on her face.  “You’ll be the first to know if he mentions something along those lines.”  “Th-thank you,” I managed to say, feeling worried that I came across as a lunatic.

I left her classroom shortly after, feeling as if I accomplished nothing.  I wanted so badly to help my son, but not a thing seemed to help.  A large part of me wished Lucy would just hurry and come back.  I had no idea just what the wish would bring.

It took a while, but Lucius adjusted back to life without Lucy.  He began to smile more and stopped crying at night.  It was such a huge relief to have our son back again.  Lucius still held onto the hope that maybe she would return home one day, but we figured once he grows up, he’ll be mature enough to understand the concept of death.

But that day didn’t have to come because of four weeks ago.

That day was so strange.  It was a little after a year from when Lucy went missing.  We were eating mashed potatoes and tacos while watching a movie.  In the middle of it, we heard scratching at the door.

I glanced at my husband, unsure of what to do.  Lucius looked at me with scared eyes.  “What is it, momma?” he asked, tightening his grip on the fork.

“I’ll go check,” Mahesh said, standing up from the table.  “Stay here.”  He placed a hand on my shoulder as he passed behind me.  “It’s probably just a racoon, but you never know,” he told me under his breath.

I turned to face Lucius.  “It’s all right, baby,” I assured him, squeezing his hand.  “Your Dada will figure it out.”  He nodded slightly.

I looked back to Mahesh.  He opened the door and froze.  “What…” he began, looking near the ground.  “Honey?” I asked, about to get out of my seat.  “Who is it-”

A squeaky bark resonated into the house.  So familiar, yet so foreign.

“Lucy?” Lucius exclaimed, jumping out of his seat.  He started running to the door and I tried to chase after him.  “Wait, Lucius!” I called out, following him.  He was already past Mahesh and out the door.

By the time I reached him, he was already being slobbered by the dog.  It was undeniably the very dog we lost.  The golden fur, the hazel eyes, even the bark was all her.

“Momma!” Lucius cried, hugging her tightly.  “It’s Lucy!  She came back!”  I looked at Mahesh with a surprised look still on his face.  “That’s really her,” he said in disbelief.  He turned to me with a smile.  Mirroring him, I gave him one in return, still shocked.

Mahesh was the first to go to his knees and embrace them both.  I followed soon after, almost brought to the point of tears seeing Lucius so happy.  We were a family again.  The warmth from all of us felt so familiar.

Except for what was touching my arm.  I opened my eyes slightly.  Lucy’s body was against it, but it was a lot colder than I remembered.  Pulling my head back a little, I noticed she was the same size as well.  It had been a year, why does she still look like a two month old puppy?

After we all got back inside, Lucius couldn’t be pried off of her.  Lucy was running around the living room, sniffing everything and licking Lucius’ face.  My husband and I watched them from the couch.

“I can’t believe she really came back,” Mahesh said, a big smile plastered on his face as he observed the two.  He turned to me.  “Maybe the dog park lie wasn’t a lie at all.”

I returned a slight smile, trying to hide my discomfort.  “Yeah, maybe.”  He looked at me confused.  “Is everything okay?” he asked, leaning in closer to me.

“I could just be in shock,” I responded, looking at the rowdy pair.  “But Lucy is colder than she should be.”  “Ellice, she’s been gone for a year.” he replied, placing his hand on mine.  “She was probably a street dog for a while which affected her health.  Of course she’s cold.”

“But that’s what’s weird, Mahesh,” I continued, turning my head toward him.  “She looks well fed and groomed, not like a street dog.”  “Someone could’ve taken her in,” he responded.  “She probably just found her way home after a while.”

“But that doesn’t explain why she still looks like a puppy,” I said in desperation, my eyes widening for emphasis.  “Hey,” Mahesh began, his grip tightening on my hand.  “It’s okay Ellice.  We’ll get everything explained soon.”

I looked up at him, confused.  “I’m going to make a vet appointment tomorrow,” he told me.  “You’re not the only one who noticed how young she looks.”  He gave me a wink and kissed my hand.  He began to get up saying, “You take Lucius to bed and I’ll put Lucy in her doghouse outside.”

Taking a deep breath, I nodded and said, “Thank you, honey.  I guess I’m just still in disbelief.”  Mahesh kissed my forehead and told me, “That makes sense, don’t worry about it.”  He then made his way to the living room.  “Come here girl,” he called to Lucy.  She trotted after him, sniffing his shoes.

I got up and walked to Lucius.  “Ready for bed?” I asked, reaching out to him for his hand.  “But momma!” he cried, taking my hand anyway.  “I want to play with Lucy!”  “I know, Lu,” I told him, rubbing the back of his hand with my thumb.  “But you can play with her all you want tomorrow after school.”  He gave me a pout but followed me to his room.

He fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, bringing a smile to my face.  I kissed his forehead and left him to rest.

I woke up the next day feeling more tired than when I went to bed.  It was hard for me to fall asleep, I just kept trying to piece together how Lucy ended up back here and looking like she did.  The more I thought, the more questions I had.

My eyes shot open, a loud sound waking me up.  I shook my head as I looked up.  “Did you manage to sleep at all?” Mahesh asked, his hand on the coffee mug he placed on the counter rather hard.  He smiled, “You look really tired, honey.”

I rubbed my eyes a bit, causing them to water.  “I got a few hours,” I responded, blinking back my watery eyes.  “I think.”  He gave me a toothy grin and chuckled while walking over.  “You still look beautiful,” he assured me, wrapping his arms around my torso and kissing my forehead.  “Even with your emo-looking eye bags.”  I rolled my eyes and kissed his nose.  He laughed and let me go.

“I’ll take Lucius to school today,” he began, grabbing his keys off the counter.  “I don’t want you driving while you’re so tired.”  “Are you sure, love?” I questioned, picking up the hot coffee mug.  “Of course,” he replied, making his way to the staircase.  “You always take him.”

“Lucius!” he called out at the bottom of the stairs.  “Are you ready, buddy?”  “Yes dada!”  my son’s cheery voice called from above.  I couldn’t help but smile.

He jumped off the last step while making a small *tup* sound.  “I’m taking you to school today,” Mahesh told him while ruffling his hair.  “So say bye to Mamma.” Looking over to where I was standing, Lucius ran while exclaiming, “Bye Momma!”  He gave me a quick hug around my legs and moved his head to face me.

“You said I can play with Lucy all I want when I get back, right?” he asked, wide eyed.  “We’ll see, baby,” I responded, squatting down to his level.  I swallowed down the lump of nerves.  “I want all of your homework finished first.”  He replied with a pouty face before nodding.

“Give me a hug,” I said, outstretching my arms.  He fell into them, wrapping his arms around my neck.  “Oh,” I groaned playfully.  “You’re getting so big, I can barely keep myself from falling over!”  He giggled, squeezing tighter as I swayed from side to side as if losing my balance.

“Let’s go now, buddy,” Mahesh said with a smile, gently tapping Lucius’ shoulder.  He turned and grabbed his hand with a small jump.  “Bye, momma!” he called, walking to the door.  “I’ll see you later, Ellice,” Mahesh said while giving me a quick kiss on the lips.  He blew me another one, and I responded with the same.

The door closed and the house fell silent.  The lack of sound was nothing new, it’s all I heard when I came back from dropping off Lucius.  However, this time it felt different, more ominous.  Then I remembered.

Lucy’s here.

The concept of dread in that moment was almost laughable to me.  Before she was lost, she was my working buddy.  She always accompanied me on grocery runs and stayed with me while I finished work assignments.  The fact that I was so anxious to spend time with her was so foreign to me.  I decided to use this day to see if there was a chance she was the same Lucy from a year prior.  “*Just treat her like you aren’t suspicious.*” I thought to myself as I headed to the back door.

When I stepped out, Lucy was there.  Staring at me.  Her hazel eyes peered deep into mine, appearing more dark as time went on.  “*Easier said than done.*” I thought.  “*Why did Mahesh have to let her out before he left?*”

“Hey, Lucy,” I called, kneeling to the ground a safe distance away.  Lucy stared at me for a minute, her eyes unwavering from mine before slowly trotting over to me.  She sniffed my hands and my face before sitting down.  This was significantly different from how she always acted, even different from last night when she came back.  “*Does she know I’m wary?*”

She continued her staring contest with me, the eyes once so full of love and excitement now trapped behind a wall deprived of emotion.  I raised a hand and brought it to her fur.  “*Still cold,*” I thought, moving it along the silky strands, praying she couldn’t feel the slight tremble.  Lucy stayed still, unaware of the possible friend or foe.  “*What on Earth happened to you?*” I asked her in my head.  “L-let’s get you some food, girl.” I said, standing up.

I led her to the door, opening it with haste.  She followed slowly, sniffing the ground as she crossed the threshold.  As soon as she was in, I reached to close the door.  A cold chill ran down my spine.  My vision became blurry as every hair on my body stood up.  My body shook in fright as I sensed the threat behind me.  I whipped my head around to see.

The only thing there was Lucy, staring at me just as she had outside.  I let out a nervous chuckle as I placed my hand over my heart in an attempt to slow it down.  I prayed that she would do something to remind me that I was spooked by a dog, but she didn’t give me even a head tilt.  She only watched me.  Clearing my throat, I stepped past her, embarrassed and unsettled.

 I walked into the kitchen, the slow tapping of nails on the hardwood floor following close behind.  Swallowing a lump in my throat I didn’t know I had, I opened up the fridge door and pulled out leftover chicken from last night’s tacos.  

“*I didn’t think we’d ever use this again.*” I thought to myself, walking over to the pantry.  I pulled out a red dog bowl with “Bensen’s Hardy Tardy Food” plastered on the side.  Lucius had begged us to keep it in the pantry, just in case she did come back.  It ended up coming in handy after all.

I placed the chicken inside and bent down to place it in front of Lucy.  There was a slight *dink* as the bowl touched the tile.  As soon as I heard that, Lucy lunged at my hand.  Her eyes grew wider as she bared her teeth before opening her jaw.  She bit down, the sound echoing throughout the whole house.  Bits of chicken flew out of the bowl.

Screaming, I yanked my hand away and took a few steps back.  With my heart racing, I looked back at her, preparing to defend myself.  However, I didn’t have to do anything like that.  Lucy was just eating out of her bowl as if she had been starved for days.

I steddied my breathing, my hand still shaking.  “You’re okay,” I whispered to myself.  “Your hand is still attached.”  This was just another thing I’d have to talk to Mahesh about.  He’s the one who fed her last night, but he didn’t say anything about her almost biting him or lunging at the food.

After I could stand normally on my own two feet,  I approached Lucy cautiously.  She seemed like an average, hungry dog.  The chicken was almost all gone.  I swallowed as I made my way past her.  I usually would put off work for a little longer, but I had to get to another room as soon as possible.

As I walked away, I noticed something on the ground.  It was small and white, almost like a clump of dried rice on the floor.  I picked it up and studied it.  It was rough and had a slight yellow tint.  I looked up at the ceiling, thinking some drywall might’ve fallen off.  “*Great.*” I thought with a sigh.  “*Now the house is falling apart.*”

I took it with me upstairs to my office, grabbing my coffee on the way.  Placing it next to my mouse, I took a seat.  The familiar tone played from my computer speakers as the logo displayed.  I got to work checking emails and setting up my presentation.  It was a proposition for a new social media software, a task that took a lot of time and energy.  In other words, a great distraction.

About fifteen minutes passed before I heard the stairs creaking with the tapping of nails on the wood.  A year ago, this wouldn’t have bothered me.  However, due to the events of that day, it was obviously different.

I took a deep breath in anticipation for Lucy’s arrival.  As if on cue, she walked in as silent as ever.  I turned to look at her.  She held no excitement to be in my office as she used to, she didn’t lick my feet or try to jump on my lap.  Lucy simply walked across the floor and sat a few feet away from me.  Just like outside and the kitchen, she just sat there.  I could’ve mistaken her for a house decoration if I didn’t see her walk in a few moments prior.  Moments that felt like hours.

“Hey, girl,” I called out, looking into her beady eyes that appeared more black than hazel.  It felt wrong so I changed my gaze to her nose.  “Do you want to come here?” I asked, patting the side of my chair as an invitation.  It didn’t deter her decision and she kept watching me.  I cleared my throat and brought my attention back to my work.

I tried to work, I really did, but I just kept feeling her eyes on me.  Her stares burned into my face like a sunburn.  It was like I was doing a test back in grade school with my teacher watching over my shoulder, making sure I wasn’t cheating.  Nothing brought me any comfort.  Even the warm streams of light from the window near my desk felt cold.

I looked out the opening, lifting my head to get a clear view of the backyard.  I drew in a big breath, gathering my courage.  I stood up and headed toward the door.  “Come here, Lucy,” I called, motioning.

She followed soon after, even moving past me to walk in front.  “*Does she know where we’re going?*” I thought, worried about what she might do.  We walked to the door and I opened it immediately.  She made her way out, giving me a quick glance as she passed the threshold.  I practically slammed the door as soon as her tail was out.

I breathed a sigh of relief, already feeling more comfortable.  Then came the guilt.  Maybe it was just because Lucy still looked like the dog we knew, but I didn’t like just leaving her out there.  My fear triumphed and I decided to just leave her a bowl of water.

I quickly washed her food bowl and filled it with tap water.  I slowly walked over to the door, hoping she was far from it before I gave her the bowl.  She sat at the far end of the lawn, facing the door.  It was as if she was waiting for me to peek at her.

Feeling as if I was intruding, I quickly opened the door back up and kneeled to place the water bowl in front of it.  She then rose up and slowly took one step towards me.  I sprung back up and shut the door.

I walked to the stairs, wiping my sweaty palms on my clothes.  My heart was still racing as I made my way up and back to my office.  My shaky legs made it hard to get there as fast as I had wanted, so I braced myself with the rail.  I half expected to hear Lucy’s nails walking behind me.  I pushed it from my mind as I quickened my pace.

I finally got back to my office, instantly feeling much more comfortable.  Rubbing my temples, I sat back down in my chair and unlocked my computer once more.

Work continued as normal with only minor hiccups in the presentation.  Boring stuff, but I’d rather have that than a dog intensely watching me work.  However, despite my desperation to ignore it, there was still the sinking feeling of abnormality creeping up on me.  The only feeling I’ve ever had since Lucy’s return.

I did what my gut was screaming at me not to do.  I turned toward the window.  I lifted my head up and gazed outside, not knowing what to expect yet knowing full well.

The two black, beady eyes stared back up at me.  It wasn’t as if she looked up at the last moment, she always had always been looking into the window.  I had never felt so violated in my own home before that moment, and the dog wasn’t even inside.

I quickly ducted my head down, a part of me hoping she didn’t see.  However, I knew she had.  “*What in the world?*” I thought to myself, feeling as if she would hear if I said it aloud.  I took a shaky deep breath.  “*She’s just an animal.  I don’t have to be this scared.*”

My body didn’t reflect that sentiment.  My hands had a slight tremble and every breath came out unsteady.  The lump in my throat was hard to swallow and the hair on my neck and arms stood up.  It was as though I was intruding on Lucy.  I wasn’t supposed to be here.

I slowly raised my hands and slapped both sides of my face.  My thoughts slowed and the fear died down a bit.  “You’re fine,” I lied, breaking the silence around me.

I turned my attention back to my work, trying my best to ignore Lucy.  The temptation to look out the window was hard to fight.  I’ll admit, a few times I took a quick glance, even using my phone camera to see without actually looking.

Lucy was there every.  Single.  Time.  She was out the window, in the same spot, staring up at the window.  And every single time, I had to calm myself back down and resist the urge to run out of the house.  I don’t even know how I would explain that to Mahesh.  “*Sorry honey,*” the imaginary me said to my husband.  “*Our dog scared me so much, I ran out of the house.*”

I glanced at the corner of my computer, a usual habit today.  4:32 p.m.  “*Mahesh should be on his way home with Lucius soon.*” I thought, as my breath escaped with relief.  Then, I recalled what Lucius asked.

It had been a full year since he had seen her.  My heart fell heavy with guilt as I grit my teeth.  I’d talk about it with Mahesh, but my stance would be firm due to when I fed her.  The entire time both of them would be in the house, neither would leave my sight.",1,1759874115.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1o0sgfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o0sgfe/this_isnt_my_dog_part_1/,This Isn't My Dog (Part 1),"Hello.  I’m not sure whether this is the place to put this story, but reading through some of the other posts here, I think you all could help me.

As the title suggests, I don’t think the dog in my house is mine.  This isn’t a case of mistaking my pet for another, Lucy looks exactly like how she left.  However, that’s the problem.  I’ll do my best to relay the story to you with as much detail as I can.

My name is Ellice and I’m married to my husband, Mahesh.  We have one son, Lucius and we have our dog, Lucy.  Rather, we had Lucy.  Honestly, I don’t know what it is at this point.

I still remember the day we got her.  She was a present for Lucius’ fifth birthday.  A few months old, soft, labrador retriever with golden fur, the brightest hazel eyes, and the cutest squeaky bark.  “A puppy!” I remember him exclaiming.  “You got me a puppy!”  He jumped up and down, his green eyes locked on her.

“Yes we did, Lu,” Mahesh said, petting her fur.  “Me and your mom decided we wanted a new addition to the family.”  I’m not even sure if Lucius heard his father, as he ran to her and started petting her.  She immediately warmed up to him, licking him all over his face.

“What do you want to name her?” I asked him while going to hug Mahesh.  “I can name her?” he said, grinning from ear to ear.  “Of course,” I responded.  “She’s your present.”

He stayed there petting her for a while before speaking up.  “Lucius!  I want to name her me!”  Mahesh and I laughed.  “Lu, your name is for boys.  She’s a girl.”  He looked defeated and pouted.  “What about…” Mahesh began.  “Lucy?”  

He looked up at us.  “Is that the girl version?”  “Yep.” I answered, actually unsure.  “She’s Lucy then!” he exclaimed, embracing her.

We loved her.  She was such a sweet puppy, always playing with us and laying on the couch whenever we would watch movies.  Lucius took the most charge by feeding her, taking her on walks with us, even helping to potty train her.  She was a major part of our family.

Unfortunately, I also remember the day that would start this whole mess.  It was two months after we got her.  I was sitting on the couch reading a book as Lucius just went outside to play with Lucy.  “Momma!” Lucius screamed.  I jolted up as he ran to the door.

He was sobbing uncontrollably and fell into my arms.  “What’s going on, baby?” I asked, brushing his black hair from his tear stained face.  He barely managed to get any words out.  “Lu-Lu-Lucy… she’s not o-outside!”

I wiped tears from his now dull green eyes.  “It’s okay, Lu,” I began, looking at him.  “Let’s go look for her together.”  He nodded, still crying.

We searched the back and front yards inside and out.  There wasn’t even a single strand of fur we could find.  Eventually, we went to ask neighbors.  Sadly, they hadn’t seen her but told us they’d spread the word and keep an eye out.  With every house that had no clue as to her whereabouts, Lucius’ face grew more pale and I could tell he was giving up hope.

I walked back, hand in hand with Lucius.  He sniffled here and there, his face covered in tears.  “Why did she run away, Momma?” he asked, staring at the ground while avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk with his tiny feet.  I stayed silent for a bit before answering, “I’m not sure, baby.”

I heard him whimper and I kneeled down.  Gently grasping his shoulders, I looked him in his eyes and wiped some tears away.  “My sweet baby boy,” I began, brushing his hair with my fingers.  “It’ll be alright.  Some puppies like Lucy will find their way home.”

“What about the puppies who don’t?” he questioned with pleading eyes.  I smiled and said the first thing that came to mind, “Then there’s a big park full of warm grass, bones, and other dogs.”  He wiped his nose and asked, “Is there plenty of salty tuna for Lucy?”  “Of course there is.”  He displayed a slight smile and I brought him in for an embrace.

“Are you tired, Lu?” I asked when I pulled away.  “A little,” he responded, his voice barely audible.  “Come here,” I said with a smile, opening my arms again.  “I’ll carry you back home.”



Mahesh came home soon after and I told him what happened.  “Aw damn,” he said, scratching the back of his neck.  “I can go talk to him and try to explain it.”  “Maybe not,” I began, staring at the ground while gnawing at my lip.  “I told him that if Lucy doesn’t come back, she’ll go to a magical dog park.”

We chuckled together, also in an attempt to cheer ourselves up.  “Anything to cheer him up, I suppose,” he stated, still laughing.  “Alright then, I’ll explain it when he’s older.”  He kissed me before wrapping his arms around my waist.  I hugged him back, burying my face in his chest.  For a long while we stood there in silence, mourning our loss.

	

That month was hard.  I can’t remember seeing Lucius smile a single time.  He often cried for Lucy at night, a light sound that would wake me up.  I remember one night in particular when I went to check up on him.

“Hey, Lu,” I began in the sweetest voice I could muster.  “Do you want to sleep with Dada and I tonight?”

He didn’t respond and continued to cry.  I sat on his bed and combed his soft hair gently with my hand.  Through muffled sobs, I heard him say, “Lucy’s in pain, Momma.  She’s hurt.”  I pulled my hand back, confused.

“What do you mean, Lucius?” I asked.  He seemed to not hear me and stayed crying.  I stayed in his room until his cries became soft snores.  I asked him about it the following morning, but he seemed to have no recollection of it happening.

	

Later, he also started excluding himself from activities at school.  After a couple of months, it got so bad to the point I got a call from his teacher, so I had a meeting with her.  

“This is a bit strange for children his age,” she began, her expression filled with worry.  “His behavior is odd, as most kids calm down their worries by this point.”  “I’m aware,” I replied, looking down at the table, the sinking feeling of failure building in my stomach.  “My husband and I are doing everything we can, but he was just so attached to Lucy.”

She smiled, “I know how hard it can be.  I raised four little rascals of my own, and it was always difficult when we lost pets.”  I gave her a small smile in response and straightened my posture, the parental pressure easing.

“I’ll help him out in class more and see if I can offer some extra support,” she continued with a bright grin.  “Just focus on helping him get through it at home.”

“Thank you so much, Mrs. Janson.” I remarked, feeling as if a weight was lifted off of my chest.  “We will continue to do so.”  My eyes unconsciously traveled to look at the table as I debated speaking about the night of Lucius’ strange comment from a while ago.

“Mrs. Iyer?” she spoke up, catching my attention.  “Is everything alright?”  “Y-yeah,” I stuttered, gaining my composure.  I fidgeted with the hem of my sleeve before asking, “Has Lucius ever said anything strange about Lucy?”

She looked at me confused, “Like her behavior before you lost her?”  I shook my head.  “No, like if he can tell she feels things.  He mentioned a while ago that she was in pain, but he doesn’t remember telling me that.”

She displayed a look of surprise.  “That is very weird.  He’s never said anything even remotely like that here.”  I slouched in my seat in defeat, thinking I must’ve sounded insane.

“I’ll keep an open ear.” she responded, a slight smile appearing on her face.  “You’ll be the first to know if he mentions something along those lines.”  “Th-thank you,” I managed to say, feeling worried that I came across as a lunatic.

I left her classroom shortly after, feeling as if I accomplished nothing.  I wanted so badly to help my son, but not a thing seemed to help.  A large part of me wished Lucy would just hurry and come back.  I had no idea just what the wish would bring.



It took a while, but Lucius adjusted back to life without Lucy.  He began to smile more and stopped crying at night.  It was such a huge relief to have our son back again.  Lucius still held onto the hope that maybe she would return home one day, but we figured once he grows up, he’ll be mature enough to understand the concept of death.

But that day didn’t have to come because of four weeks ago.

That day was so strange.  It was a little after a year from when Lucy went missing.  We were eating mashed potatoes and tacos while watching a movie.  In the middle of it, we heard scratching at the door.

I glanced at my husband, unsure of what to do.  Lucius looked at me with scared eyes.  “What is it, momma?” he asked, tightening his grip on the fork.

“I’ll go check,” Mahesh said, standing up from the table.  “Stay here.”  He placed a hand on my shoulder as he passed behind me.  “It’s probably just a racoon, but you never know,” he told me under his breath.

I turned to face Lucius.  “It’s all right, baby,” I assured him, squeezing his hand.  “Your Dada will figure it out.”  He nodded slightly.

I looked back to Mahesh.  He opened the door and froze.  “What…” he began, looking near the ground.  “Honey?” I asked, about to get out of my seat.  “Who is it-”

A squeaky bark resonated into the house.  So familiar, yet so foreign.

“Lucy?” Lucius exclaimed, jumping out of his seat.  He started running to the door and I tried to chase after him.  “Wait, Lucius!” I called out, following him.  He was already past Mahesh and out the door.

By the time I reached him, he was already being slobbered by the dog.  It was undeniably the very dog we lost.  The golden fur, the hazel eyes, even the bark was all her.

“Momma!” Lucius cried, hugging her tightly.  “It’s Lucy!  She came back!”  I looked at Mahesh with a surprised look still on his face.  “That’s really her,” he said in disbelief.  He turned to me with a smile.  Mirroring him, I gave him one in return, still shocked.

Mahesh was the first to go to his knees and embrace them both.  I followed soon after, almost brought to the point of tears seeing Lucius so happy.  We were a family again.  The warmth from all of us felt so familiar.

Except for what was touching my arm.  I opened my eyes slightly.  Lucy’s body was against it, but it was a lot colder than I remembered.  Pulling my head back a little, I noticed she was the same size as well.  It had been a year, why does she still look like a two month old puppy?

After we all got back inside, Lucius couldn’t be pried off of her.  Lucy was running around the living room, sniffing everything and licking Lucius’ face.  My husband and I watched them from the couch.

“I can’t believe she really came back,” Mahesh said, a big smile plastered on his face as he observed the two.  He turned to me.  “Maybe the dog park lie wasn’t a lie at all.”

I returned a slight smile, trying to hide my discomfort.  “Yeah, maybe.”  He looked at me confused.  “Is everything okay?” he asked, leaning in closer to me.

“I could just be in shock,” I responded, looking at the rowdy pair.  “But Lucy is colder than she should be.”  “Ellice, she’s been gone for a year.” he replied, placing his hand on mine.  “She was probably a street dog for a while which affected her health.  Of course she’s cold.”

“But that’s what’s weird, Mahesh,” I continued, turning my head toward him.  “She looks well fed and groomed, not like a street dog.”  “Someone could’ve taken her in,” he responded.  “She probably just found her way home after a while.”

“But that doesn’t explain why she still looks like a puppy,” I said in desperation, my eyes widening for emphasis.  “Hey,” Mahesh began, his grip tightening on my hand.  “It’s okay Ellice.  We’ll get everything explained soon.”

I looked up at him, confused.  “I’m going to make a vet appointment tomorrow,” he told me.  “You’re not the only one who noticed how young she looks.”  He gave me a wink and kissed my hand.  He began to get up saying, “You take Lucius to bed and I’ll put Lucy in her doghouse outside.”

Taking a deep breath, I nodded and said, “Thank you, honey.  I guess I’m just still in disbelief.”  Mahesh kissed my forehead and told me, “That makes sense, don’t worry about it.”  He then made his way to the living room.  “Come here girl,” he called to Lucy.  She trotted after him, sniffing his shoes.

I got up and walked to Lucius.  “Ready for bed?” I asked, reaching out to him for his hand.  “But momma!” he cried, taking my hand anyway.  “I want to play with Lucy!”  “I know, Lu,” I told him, rubbing the back of his hand with my thumb.  “But you can play with her all you want tomorrow after school.”  He gave me a pout but followed me to his room.

He fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, bringing a smile to my face.  I kissed his forehead and left him to rest.



I woke up the next day feeling more tired than when I went to bed.  It was hard for me to fall asleep, I just kept trying to piece together how Lucy ended up back here and looking like she did.  The more I thought, the more questions I had.

My eyes shot open, a loud sound waking me up.  I shook my head as I looked up.  “Did you manage to sleep at all?” Mahesh asked, his hand on the coffee mug he placed on the counter rather hard.  He smiled, “You look really tired, honey.”

I rubbed my eyes a bit, causing them to water.  “I got a few hours,” I responded, blinking back my watery eyes.  “I think.”  He gave me a toothy grin and chuckled while walking over.  “You still look beautiful,” he assured me, wrapping his arms around my torso and kissing my forehead.  “Even with your emo-looking eye bags.”  I rolled my eyes and kissed his nose.  He laughed and let me go.

“I’ll take Lucius to school today,” he began, grabbing his keys off the counter.  “I don’t want you driving while you’re so tired.”  “Are you sure, love?” I questioned, picking up the hot coffee mug.  “Of course,” he replied, making his way to the staircase.  “You always take him.”

“Lucius!” he called out at the bottom of the stairs.  “Are you ready, buddy?”  “Yes dada!”  my son’s cheery voice called from above.  I couldn’t help but smile.

He jumped off the last step while making a small *tup* sound.  “I’m taking you to school today,” Mahesh told him while ruffling his hair.  “So say bye to Mamma.” Looking over to where I was standing, Lucius ran while exclaiming, “Bye Momma!”  He gave me a quick hug around my legs and moved his head to face me.

“You said I can play with Lucy all I want when I get back, right?” he asked, wide eyed.  “We’ll see, baby,” I responded, squatting down to his level.  I swallowed down the lump of nerves.  “I want all of your homework finished first.”  He replied with a pouty face before nodding.

“Give me a hug,” I said, outstretching my arms.  He fell into them, wrapping his arms around my neck.  “Oh,” I groaned playfully.  “You’re getting so big, I can barely keep myself from falling over!”  He giggled, squeezing tighter as I swayed from side to side as if losing my balance.

“Let’s go now, buddy,” Mahesh said with a smile, gently tapping Lucius’ shoulder.  He turned and grabbed his hand with a small jump.  “Bye, momma!” he called, walking to the door.  “I’ll see you later, Ellice,” Mahesh said while giving me a quick kiss on the lips.  He blew me another one, and I responded with the same.

The door closed and the house fell silent.  The lack of sound was nothing new, it’s all I heard when I came back from dropping off Lucius.  However, this time it felt different, more ominous.  Then I remembered.

Lucy’s here.

The concept of dread in that moment was almost laughable to me.  Before she was lost, she was my working buddy.  She always accompanied me on grocery runs and stayed with me while I finished work assignments.  The fact that I was so anxious to spend time with her was so foreign to me.  I decided to use this day to see if there was a chance she was the same Lucy from a year prior.  “*Just treat her like you aren’t suspicious.*” I thought to myself as I headed to the back door.

When I stepped out, Lucy was there.  Staring at me.  Her hazel eyes peered deep into mine, appearing more dark as time went on.  “*Easier said than done.*” I thought.  “*Why did Mahesh have to let her out before he left?*”

“Hey, Lucy,” I called, kneeling to the ground a safe distance away.  Lucy stared at me for a minute, her eyes unwavering from mine before slowly trotting over to me.  She sniffed my hands and my face before sitting down.  This was significantly different from how she always acted, even different from last night when she came back.  “*Does she know I’m wary?*”

She continued her staring contest with me, the eyes once so full of love and excitement now trapped behind a wall deprived of emotion.  I raised a hand and brought it to her fur.  “*Still cold,*” I thought, moving it along the silky strands, praying she couldn’t feel the slight tremble.  Lucy stayed still, unaware of the possible friend or foe.  “*What on Earth happened to you?*” I asked her in my head.  “L-let’s get you some food, girl.” I said, standing up.

I led her to the door, opening it with haste.  She followed slowly, sniffing the ground as she crossed the threshold.  As soon as she was in, I reached to close the door.  A cold chill ran down my spine.  My vision became blurry as every hair on my body stood up.  My body shook in fright as I sensed the threat behind me.  I whipped my head around to see.

The only thing there was Lucy, staring at me just as she had outside.  I let out a nervous chuckle as I placed my hand over my heart in an attempt to slow it down.  I prayed that she would do something to remind me that I was spooked by a dog, but she didn’t give me even a head tilt.  She only watched me.  Clearing my throat, I stepped past her, embarrassed and unsettled.

 I walked into the kitchen, the slow tapping of nails on the hardwood floor following close behind.  Swallowing a lump in my throat I didn’t know I had, I opened up the fridge door and pulled out leftover chicken from last night’s tacos.  

“*I didn’t think we’d ever use this again.*” I thought to myself, walking over to the pantry.  I pulled out a red dog bowl with “Bensen’s Hardy Tardy Food” plastered on the side.  Lucius had begged us to keep it in the pantry, just in case she did come back.  It ended up coming in handy after all.

I placed the chicken inside and bent down to place it in front of Lucy.  There was a slight *dink* as the bowl touched the tile.  As soon as I heard that, Lucy lunged at my hand.  Her eyes grew wider as she bared her teeth before opening her jaw.  She bit down, the sound echoing throughout the whole house.  Bits of chicken flew out of the bowl.

Screaming, I yanked my hand away and took a few steps back.  With my heart racing, I looked back at her, preparing to defend myself.  However, I didn’t have to do anything like that.  Lucy was just eating out of her bowl as if she had been starved for days.

I steddied my breathing, my hand still shaking.  “You’re okay,” I whispered to myself.  “Your hand is still attached.”  This was just another thing I’d have to talk to Mahesh about.  He’s the one who fed her last night, but he didn’t say anything about her almost biting him or lunging at the food.

After I could stand normally on my own two feet,  I approached Lucy cautiously.  She seemed like an average, hungry dog.  The chicken was almost all gone.  I swallowed as I made my way past her.  I usually would put off work for a little longer, but I had to get to another room as soon as possible.

As I walked away, I noticed something on the ground.  It was small and white, almost like a clump of dried rice on the floor.  I picked it up and studied it.  It was rough and had a slight yellow tint.  I looked up at the ceiling, thinking some drywall might’ve fallen off.  “*Great.*” I thought with a sigh.  “*Now the house is falling apart.*”

I took it with me upstairs to my office, grabbing my coffee on the way.  Placing it next to my mouse, I took a seat.  The familiar tone played from my computer speakers as the logo displayed.  I got to work checking emails and setting up my presentation.  It was a proposition for a new social media software, a task that took a lot of time and energy.  In other words, a great distraction.

About fifteen minutes passed before I heard the stairs creaking with the tapping of nails on the wood.  A year ago, this wouldn’t have bothered me.  However, due to the events of that day, it was obviously different.

I took a deep breath in anticipation for Lucy’s arrival.  As if on cue, she walked in as silent as ever.  I turned to look at her.  She held no excitement to be in my office as she used to, she didn’t lick my feet or try to jump on my lap.  Lucy simply walked across the floor and sat a few feet away from me.  Just like outside and the kitchen, she just sat there.  I could’ve mistaken her for a house decoration if I didn’t see her walk in a few moments prior.  Moments that felt like hours.

“Hey, girl,” I called out, looking into her beady eyes that appeared more black than hazel.  It felt wrong so I changed my gaze to her nose.  “Do you want to come here?” I asked, patting the side of my chair as an invitation.  It didn’t deter her decision and she kept watching me.  I cleared my throat and brought my attention back to my work.

I tried to work, I really did, but I just kept feeling her eyes on me.  Her stares burned into my face like a sunburn.  It was like I was doing a test back in grade school with my teacher watching over my shoulder, making sure I wasn’t cheating.  Nothing brought me any comfort.  Even the warm streams of light from the window near my desk felt cold.

I looked out the opening, lifting my head to get a clear view of the backyard.  I drew in a big breath, gathering my courage.  I stood up and headed toward the door.  “Come here, Lucy,” I called, motioning.

She followed soon after, even moving past me to walk in front.  “*Does she know where we’re going?*” I thought, worried about what she might do.  We walked to the door and I opened it immediately.  She made her way out, giving me a quick glance as she passed the threshold.  I practically slammed the door as soon as her tail was out.

I breathed a sigh of relief, already feeling more comfortable.  Then came the guilt.  Maybe it was just because Lucy still looked like the dog we knew, but I didn’t like just leaving her out there.  My fear triumphed and I decided to just leave her a bowl of water.

I quickly washed her food bowl and filled it with tap water.  I slowly walked over to the door, hoping she was far from it before I gave her the bowl.  She sat at the far end of the lawn, facing the door.  It was as if she was waiting for me to peek at her.

Feeling as if I was intruding, I quickly opened the door back up and kneeled to place the water bowl in front of it.  She then rose up and slowly took one step towards me.  I sprung back up and shut the door.

I walked to the stairs, wiping my sweaty palms on my clothes.  My heart was still racing as I made my way up and back to my office.  My shaky legs made it hard to get there as fast as I had wanted, so I braced myself with the rail.  I half expected to hear Lucy’s nails walking behind me.  I pushed it from my mind as I quickened my pace.

I finally got back to my office, instantly feeling much more comfortable.  Rubbing my temples, I sat back down in my chair and unlocked my computer once more.

Work continued as normal with only minor hiccups in the presentation.  Boring stuff, but I’d rather have that than a dog intensely watching me work.  However, despite my desperation to ignore it, there was still the sinking feeling of abnormality creeping up on me.  The only feeling I’ve ever had since Lucy’s return.

I did what my gut was screaming at me not to do.  I turned toward the window.  I lifted my head up and gazed outside, not knowing what to expect yet knowing full well.

The two black, beady eyes stared back up at me.  It wasn’t as if she looked up at the last moment, she always had always been looking into the window.  I had never felt so violated in my own home before that moment, and the dog wasn’t even inside.

I quickly ducted my head down, a part of me hoping she didn’t see.  However, I knew she had.  “*What in the world?*” I thought to myself, feeling as if she would hear if I said it aloud.  I took a shaky deep breath.  “*She’s just an animal.  I don’t have to be this scared.*”

My body didn’t reflect that sentiment.  My hands had a slight tremble and every breath came out unsteady.  The lump in my throat was hard to swallow and the hair on my neck and arms stood up.  It was as though I was intruding on Lucy.  I wasn’t supposed to be here.

I slowly raised my hands and slapped both sides of my face.  My thoughts slowed and the fear died down a bit.  “You’re fine,” I lied, breaking the silence around me.

I turned my attention back to my work, trying my best to ignore Lucy.  The temptation to look out the window was hard to fight.  I’ll admit, a few times I took a quick glance, even using my phone camera to see without actually looking.

Lucy was there every.  Single.  Time.  She was out the window, in the same spot, staring up at the window.  And every single time, I had to calm myself back down and resist the urge to run out of the house.  I don’t even know how I would explain that to Mahesh.  “*Sorry honey,*” the imaginary me said to my husband.  “*Our dog scared me so much, I ran out of the house.*”

I glanced at the corner of my computer, a usual habit today.  4:32 p.m.  “*Mahesh should be on his way home with Lucius soon.*” I thought, as my breath escaped with relief.  Then, I recalled what Lucius asked.

It had been a full year since he had seen her.  My heart fell heavy with guilt as I grit my teeth.  I’d talk about it with Mahesh, but my stance would be firm due to when I fed her.  The entire time both of them would be in the house, neither would leave my sight.",1,1759873886.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1o0sg6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1o0sg6z/the_museum_doesnt_collect_art_it_collects_us/,The Museum Doesn’t Collect Art. It Collects Us.,"I swear this is real. I don’t know if anyone will believe me, but I have to write it down while I still can before whatever this is finishes what it started. 

It began yesterday morning, when the museum appeared.

That’s the part everyone in town agrees on. We woke up and there it was, sitting in the empty lot next to the old post office. A sprawling, black structure that hadn’t been there the night before. No trucks, no construction noise, no flyers. Just there.

The sign out front read, in tall white serif letters:

THE MUSEUM OF LOST PEOPLE

And underneath:

ADMISSION FREE — ONE DAY ONLY

The whole thing looked temporary but somehow ancient, like someone had dragged a piece of another century into ours. Black canvas walls. Brass frames. A faint smell of dust and candle wax even from the sidewalk.

By noon, half the town had already gone in.

I wasn’t going to. I had work, deadlines, a normal life to keep moving. But then someone from the café posted a picture online, a dim hallway full of wax figures so realistic it made my skin crawl. Each one had a little plaque with a person’s name and the date they’d gone missing.

That’s when the comments started.

“My cousin disappeared in ‘03. That’s his name.”

“This one looks EXACTLY like my sister.”

“How the hell did they get the details right? Her birthmark’s there.”

By evening, people were freaking out. Some called it a hoax, some said it was performance art, some said it was a government project. No one knew. And no one knew where the curators were. There was no one at the entrance, no ticket booth. The doors just stood open.

So after dark, I went. The air changed the second I stepped inside. You know that muffled quiet museums have, where your own footsteps sound too loud? It was like that but heavier, like the silence had a weight.

The first room was lit by these weak amber bulbs that made everything look sepia-toned. The floor creaked under me, and rows of figures stretched into the gloom, each behind a little velvet rope, perfectly still, eyes glassy and skin with that waxy translucence that looked too close to real.

The plaques said things like:

AMANDA CROWLEY — MISSING SINCE 1984

LEONARD GRAVES — MISSING SINCE 1999

RITA NGUYEN — MISSING SINCE 2007

Hundreds of them.

I kept telling myself it was just art, some elaborate installation. But I couldn’t stop staring at the details, pores, tiny hairs, the moisture line along the eyes. The kind of things wax museums don’t get right.

Then I noticed something else. Every few steps, I’d feel… watched. Like the air itself was shifting behind me. But every time I turned around, the statues were still.

Still but not quite where I remembered them. There was this man in a long coat near the start. I swear, when I first walked in, he was looking straight ahead. But when I looked back, his head was turned slightly toward me.

I laughed it off. Told myself I was imagining it.

But then the lights flickered. And I realized there was music playing, so faint I hadn’t noticed it until then, a warbling old phonograph tune, something scratchy and distorted, looping over and over.

“Come wanderer, come find your way home…”

I felt sick. Still, I went deeper.

The second room was colder. The figures here weren’t behind ropes. They just stood along the walls, close enough to touch. I shouldn’t have. But I reached out and brushed one’s sleeve. A woman in a polka-dot dress, head slightly bowed. The fabric was soft. Not plastic. Not wax. Real cloth.

And her skin under it, not cold like I expected. Room temperature. I jerked my hand back.

The plaque at her feet read:

MARJORIE WELLS — MISSING SINCE 1971

And when I leaned closer to look…her eyes moved. Just the tiniest flicker, like her pupils adjusted to the light. I stumbled backward, knocking into another figure, a child holding a stuffed rabbit. Its head lolled, almost imperceptibly.

That’s when I realized something else.

Every statue’s head was angled ever so slightly toward the exit. As if they were all watching whoever walked through.

I wanted to leave right then, but the path was narrow, winding deeper into the dark. The sign above the next archway said THE RECENTLY LOST.

I told myself I’d look for just a second. Just enough to say I saw it.

But when I stepped through, the temperature dropped another ten degrees. My breath came out white. The smell changed too…no more wax or dust, just that thick, organic rot smell, like a cellar that hasn’t been opened in years.

The lighting was dimmer here. Each figure stood under its own single bulb, humming faintly. And these ones…weren’t historical.

They were current. Names I’d seen on missing posters. People from the next county. A girl from my high school who’d disappeared last year. Even a local cop who went missing on duty.

And every single one of them was perfect. Too perfect. The kind of perfection that only comes from the real thing. I think that’s when I started shaking. I couldn’t breathe. I wanted to scream but my throat locked up.

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a curtain at the far end. Behind it, faint movement. Something whispered my name. I froze. It came again, from behind the curtain. And it sounded exactly like me.

My own voice. I don’t know why, but I stepped forward. The curtain was made of black velvet, heavier than it looked. I pushed it aside and there it was.

Another room. Smaller. Only one figure in the center, under a single white light. At first, I thought it was just another statue. Same glassy eyes, same stillness.

Then I saw the plaque.

\[MY NAME\] — MISSING SINCE OCTOBER 7, 2025

Today’s date. I laughed like, really laughed, the kind of sound you make when you’re too scared to think straight. I thought it had to be some kind of prank. Someone from town messing with me.

But the longer I looked, the less I could deny it. The statue wasn’t just a look-alike. It was me. Down to the scar on my chin, the tiny chip on my front tooth. Even my clothes, my jacket, my shoes, the stain on the sleeve I’d gotten that morning spilling coffee.

And my expression frozen mid-breath, like I’d just seen something terrifying. I staggered back. My hand brushed the figure’s arm and it was warm.

Warmer than mine.

Then its chest moved. Just once. Like a slow inhale. I ran. I don’t even remember how I made it out, just flashes of faces turning as I passed, those dead eyes following me, the lights flickering overhead like the building itself was breathing.

When I burst through the exit, the night was completely silent. The lot was empty. No building. No crowd. No sign.

Just dirt and gravel under my shoes, like it had never been there at all. I thought maybe I’d hallucinated the whole thing. Maybe there’d been gas leaks, or carbon monoxide, or something. But when I got home and checked my phone, the photos were still there, blurry shots of the exhibits, the names, the faces.

Except… when I scrolled further, there was one I didn’t remember taking.

A photo of me, standing in front of the “MARJORIE WELLS” statue, staring at something behind the camera.

Only I wasn’t holding the phone in the reflection. Someone else was.

I didn’t sleep last night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that figure of me breathing in the dark.

This morning, I called the police. They said they’d send a car to the lot, but when they got there, it was just empty ground. No tracks, no structure. They sounded annoyed. Said I should probably talk to someone. But then the officer paused.

He asked me to confirm my name. And when I did, there was a long silence.

Then he said, “That’s strange. We already have a report open under that name. You’ve been missing since yesterday.”

I hung up. Now I keep noticing little things that don’t add up.

My reflection’s a half-second behind. The lights flicker when I pass under them. And my phone camera glitches every time I point it at my face. I thought maybe I could post this, get help, make someone believe me. But while I’ve been typing, I noticed something.

On the floor, faint, like dust scuffs, there’s a trail of footprints leading from my front door to where I’m sitting.

They’re bare. And smaller than mine. I just heard the music again. That same old phonograph tune, coming from somewhere outside.

“Come wanderer, come find your way home…”

It’s getting louder. I think they’re setting up the museum again. Maybe for the next town. Maybe for whoever’s reading this. But there’s one more thing I have to tell you before it’s too late.

When I looked closer at the photo of my statue, the one of me breathing, I noticed something I hadn’t before. There was someone standing behind it. Just a dark silhouette with long, thin hands reaching toward my shoulders.

And between its fingers, something shiny, like a tag. A plaque. I zoomed in as far as I could. 

It didn’t say MISSING SINCE.

It said RETURNED.

Returned *to where*?

Then it hit me. The museum doesn’t just collect the missing. It replaces them. It takes you, keeps the real you, and sends something back that looks and sounds the same, something hollow, trying to remember what warmth felt like.

I touched my arm just now, and it didn’t feel right. The skin’s too smooth. No pulse, just a faint vibration under the surface, like machinery humming through [wax.](https://www.reddit.com/user/salty_Astronaut77/comments/1nurxyq/want_more_horror_im_sharing_exclusive/)

1o0sfya,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o0sfya/give_me_brutal_real_advice_and_some_level_of/,Give me brutal real advice and some level of insight por favor gang,"Hey all, 21M here, 22 next week. Had a beautiful, probably the nicest relationship I had in my life end about a month and a little bit ago. Our relationship spanned about a year and a half and it was rly rly good. I have nothing rly bad to say abt her as a person. For some reason I still have a soft spot for her despite of being dumped but when we went through a rough month before the breakup she mentioned that she felt overwhelmed with a lot in her life and couldn’t give to a relationship in this moment. She had her lsats coming up, law school apps, a new course in uni, but mentioned that she can’t give fully to a relationship. Met up with her like 3 weeks after the breakup and it was different for sure, she side hugged me and I said that was weird. She removed me off her private account on IG, I called it out jokingly and she giggled saying it’s weird to have me on there now despite of her throughout the relationship telling me how much she loves me, we spoke abt marriage, kids, even her family rly likes me. I’m her first boyfriend and we’re both brown so there are social rules around that in itself but, I rly loved her. Still do. Think abt her often and it was hard and still is but started putting myself first now. I wonder if she thinks about me. She loves posting on social media and we had rly good trips tgt to LA nyc etc but she posted a post on ig not too long ago of her on a trip to LA which I was supposed to be on. She’s w her sister and friend there. It sucks that way but rly I asked her if at any point I pushed her to breakup and again she said it was purely a she feels like it’s a pivotal moment she needs for herself in her life in terms of growth. It feels as though im discarded but I remember vividly all our conversations about each other. She rly did love me when we r together i don’t doubt it. Just sad to think that eventually she’ll stop and probably doesn’t think about me. Lots of my friends said social media is fake but eh idk. Anyone gone through something like this? She also while breaking up mentioned she can’t see herself without any1 else, doesn’t think she’ll fall out of love but now that’s just noise or atleast that’s what I need to tell myself because our last interaction was certainly not like how we were when together. Still caught up and had a nice coffee but maybe cuz it was still fresh? Hurts to see that she’s livin so much better and in a fun manner. Hard to believe this since I remember what we had was good. We treated each other well nothing inherently crazy had our small arguments that transpired to bigger ones but we’re young & learning. What annoyed me was when I said so do u wanna date other ppl now? That would’ve made me delete her from my life if she said yes cuz then why is she breaking up w me and masking it as a I need to work on myself thing but she said no not right now she doesn’t see it has no time but eventually duh is what she said. Then she said would you invite me to your wedding??? I said bruh I want you as of rn so why am I even imagining a wedding she said ur someone I loved I want to celebrate you??? Dude idk if it’s because this was her first relationship or not but how much of what she’s saying rly is true. Thought she was my biggest blessing but turned out to be my biggest lesson. We rly were super tight, but yeah despite of her thinking she wanted to stay friends we called crying one night when it was fresh and realized it was not the solution to stay friends. Still though i said yeah so we’re fully done? And she said well yeah (but when breaking up she said I hope you’re single when I improve) but now she said well yeah?? Followed by but idk what If 10 years down you’re still in this place. Idk. Help. Just gotta do me ",1,1759873852.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

**Day 1: Albany to Hudson (44 mi)** – Easy rail trail, some hills. Stayed at The Wick Hudson.

**Day 2: Hudson to New Paltz (57 mi)** – Hilly roads, not much ""trail"", beautiful scenery. Friend's headset came loose, luckily found a garage mechanic off-trail near Germantown. Gravel section between Kingston and New Paltz was a highlight. Stayed at Americas Best Hotel.

**Day 3: New Paltz to Brewster (50 mi)** – Nearly all rail trail, flat with easy descents. Remote and scenic. Stayed at Heidi's Inn (1.5 mi off trail, uphill, but good breakfast and walkable Mexican restaurant).

**Day 4: Brewster to Battery Park (70 mi)** – 90% trail, flat and easy. Greenway was packed on a sunny Sunday but still fun.

**Lunch & Coffee Stops**

* **Hamrah's Lebanese Takeaway** (Kinderhook) – Perfect cycling fuel
* **Tivoli General** (Tivoli) – Sandwiches, great espresso
* **Village Grocery and Refillery** (Kingston) – water bottle refill, also coffee, snacks, fruit, etc
* **Homestead Marketplace** (Stormville) – Last good lunch option before Brewster
* **Trailside Cafe** (Yorktown Heights) – coffee and smoothie stop
* **Booskerdoo Coffee & Baking** (Ardsley) – Bagel sandwiches, great espresso

**Notes**

* No bike shops between Hudson and Kingston
* Stick to pedestrian path on Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge
* 28mm tires handled gravel section between Kingston and New Paltz fine in dry conditions.

I’ve been a long time lurker on this subreddit and have been interested in an espresso machine for quite some time.

I’ve tried a manual (breville bambino) and semi-automatic (ninja luxe) but could never get them to pull good espresso. The ninja customer service agent actually just told me to return mine because everything was super acidic and it wasn’t even resembling espresso at all. So I’ve finally decided to simplify the process and just go for a fully automatic to save time and all the headache. 

Costco currently has a deal where the Delonghi ($150 off) and the Philips ($280 off) are about the same price and I’ve been debating which one would be better. I’d mostly make cappuccinos or espresso shots for iced coffee. 

Mostly curious on espresso quality, maintenance, and durability of these two machines!  

I’ve also been considering the KF7 with an insider pass but I’m nervous about the return policy since it is quite a bit more expensive.

Someone is also selling a TK-01 on marketplace for $250 but haven’t seen many good reviews for this machine on here. 

Let me know if you guys have any insights! Thank you in advance!!

1o0s893,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1o0s893/do_you_do_coffee_chats_with_strangers_who_want_to/,Do you do coffee chats with strangers who want to know about your work?,"I’m wondering if anyone accepts coffee chats with people that are not in your industry and are in an industry that you’re not interested in or are still students. 

I used to do coffee chats with random ppl who ask nicely, but it’s usually me spending the hours telling other people about my work and I don’t get anything in return. I’m not interested in moving industry and 99% of the times, the people who asks me was just taking my industry as one of their 100 options. In the end I didn’t really make a meaningful professional nor real life connection.

I understand that ppl expect industry professionals to want to help other people, but is it wrong for me to not want to schedule any coffee chats with people that are not already in the industry or have info that I also want to know? Is it okay to tell them I no longer do coffee chats? 

Edit: Maybe I’ll just thank them for their interest in the industry and encourage them to apply, and if they ask again about the coffee chat I’ll let them know I am really busy? (TBH I’d rather spend 30 mins to listen to podcasts or take a online course that will actually benefit my career) ",1,1759873361.0,AskWomenOver30,15,0.6,False
1o0s861,https://www.reddit.com/r/HoustonPlatonicR4R/comments/1o0s861/36_f4a_looking_for_likeminded_friends_platonic/,36 [F4A] Looking for Like-Minded Friends (Platonic Only),"Hi everyone! I'm a 36-year-old woman who lives in the Houston area (East End), and I'm hoping to meet people with similar interests to build some meaningful friendships. I'm open to friends of any gender, but just to be clear, I’m only seeking platonic connections. I recently went through a rough breakup, so I'm not looking to jump into dating. I'm working on rebuilding my life and support system at the moment (hence looking for friends). 

I'm not really into drinking or the bar/club scene anymore, so I’m a bit out of my element when it comes to meeting new people these days. I also have social anxiety, which makes it tough to initiate conversations (especially with strangers), but I’m kind, genuine, and always happy to connect once I feel comfortable.

A little about me and what I’m into:

I love reading, art (drawing & painting), photography (though I don’t currently own a camera), and DIY projects. I like walking on nature trails, gardening, city biking (I ride a road bike), thrifting, traveling, cooking and baking. My favorite movie genre is horror (but I do watch others). I like collecting and admiring oddities/curiosities, and specimens. Music is also a huge passion—especially punk, metal, goth, garage, post-punk, etc. I love going to shows and collecting records and tapes. I’m far left on the political spectrum.

Due to chronic health conditions, I do have some physical limitations, so I’m not looking for a gym buddy or to train for marathons. But, I am always down to hang out casually, grab coffee or dinner, visit local markets or museums, go to a show, craft together, or just stroll a nature trail.

I’m looking to find a genuine connection with a friend. The kind that feels easy and real. Someone I can talk to about anything, without feeling judged or misunderstood. The kind of friendship where silence isn’t awkward, where laughter comes naturally, and where honesty doesn’t have to be filtered. I’m not looking for perfection, just authenticity. Someone who values depth over small talk, and sincerity over surface-level connections.

I'd like to start with messaging, graduate to texting, and then hopefully make plans to hang out in person once we're both comfortable.",1,1759873355.0,HoustonPlatonicR4R,0,1.0,False

* I became an aquafit instructor just for access to the pool’s lost & found shampoo. I didn’t have to buy these items FOR YEARS!
* Lived in an RV parked in the driveway of my rental property. Gave my tenant $100 off rent to let me stay there. I taped my debts to the ceiling for motivation. It was humbling and cold, but it got results.
* I took everyone’s leftovers at restaurants when eating out with friends and family. I would “forget” my wallet. Sometimes I would crash my friends’ vacations and sleep on the hotel room floor to save on travel.
* Used dollar-store solar lights indoors, washed dishes at work, reused cracker boxes as paper towels for bacon grease.
* My ex added all the kids to his YMCA pass for a few years. So I bathed my kids at the YMCA every night to save on utilities. I would volunteer to “clean up” after parties just to get free leftovers.
* I volunteered at a thrift store. The staff would set aside the best finds, then I flipped them on Poshmark.
* Sold my car and bought cargo bikes. Transportation costs dropped to 3% of our budget.
* We would pretend to have “plans” when invited to get-togethers at restaurants, and either show up early just for drinks, or at the end just for dessert/coffee. We paid for Christmas with TD promo gift cards we got during a promotional week. Showed up at opening every day to be one of the first 10 transactions to get the gift cards. 
* I bought dirty work clothes from a Cintas laundry guy for $5, washed and resold them to tradies for $10.
* Unplugged my fridge for winter and kept food on the balcony.
* RSVP’d to corporate events in my area for free catered meals. I’d pretend to be a junior analyst or a consultant. I even carried a clipboard and used a fake name. 
* Joined a gym for a free trial, showered there daily, never worked out.
* I bought used clothing bundles on Facebook for my kids, then resold them at the same price when they grew out of them. I did have to be careful to keep them in good shape though. 
* I used to buy used, broken items and return them to manufacturers with lifetime guarantees for full refunds. Only certain brands do this, though, like Cutco, Le Crueset. So you need to do your research first. 
* My father-in-law stole toilet paper from the YMCA twice a day. He had a laundry basket full of it.
* We saved shower water to flush the toilet.
* Save wild apples and put them in a cooler to eat over winter. 

Your turn.

Here’s What I Learned from Researching Installations in Tennessee,"I’ve been digging into screen room installations lately, and honestly, it’s one of the best ways to upgrade an outdoor space—especially if you live somewhere hot or buggy like Tennessee.

A good screen room isn’t just about keeping mosquitoes out. It’s about creating a space you *actually* want to use. Morning coffee without sweating. Dinner outside without swatting bugs. Rain? Still fine.

One company I came across, **JB’s Enclosures**, has done some really solid projects around Riverview, FL. They handle design, materials, and installation, and they focus on custom builds instead of those cookie-cutter kits. Aluminum framing, UV-resistant screens, even optional lighting.

A few takeaways I picked up while researching:

* **Design matters.** Placement and shade make a big difference in comfort.
* **Good screens** (fiberglass or solar/UV) keep airflow while cutting glare.
* **Durability counts.** Aluminum framing lasts and doesn’t rust.
* **ROI is real.** Screen rooms can boost home value and curb appeal.

If anyone’s done a screen room or screened patio enclosure before—what did you wish you knew beforehand? Anything you’d recommend (or avoid) for Tennessee weather?",1,1759873326.0,ContractorCorner1,0,1.0,False

1o0s76w,https://www.reddit.com/r/RatsRatsRats/comments/1o0s76w/new_rat_owner/,New Rat owner,"Hello,

I have just got 2 male rats I believe they are around 3 months old. One of them hadn’t been handled before (Coffee) and one had (Lychee), Coffee has bitten me a few times now even when I’m not near him but stroking his brother or when I have just opened the cage and called them over. He will come up and sometimes take food from me with his front paws on my hand other times he will just try bite my fingers even if there is no food or smell of food on me.

Lychee has come out and onto my hands now and let me put him on my bed but will try and get off the bed and get into gaps that I have tried to cover. I thought he wanted to go back and would put him back into the cage and he will jump into my hands again to come back out.

When I put Lychee back in the cage he will attack Coffee and Coffee will squick, it doesn’t look like he’s hurt. Is this normal behaviour?

Is there anything that I can do to help them to bond with me, I am going to make sure my room gets sorted so that they can’t get any where they shouldn’t but I don’t have tons of space as they have them in my bedroom. I’m thinking about getting them a cat tree as I’ve seen that rats enjoy them.

Sorry for the amount of writing, any help will be appreciated on anything that I can do to help them",1,1759873294.0,RatsRatsRats,0,1.0,False

Entitled"" where is he now "", dedicated to Rudolf Hess which contains hitherto unseen reports from both axis and allied sources on his life, medical history psychological profiles etc. it also contains a series of "" aged"" photographs purporting to show how Hess will look in 1970, 1975 and 1980.

* A three foot (one meter) length of red silk. At either end, the silk is weighted by a small stone disk tied into the silk. If held at one end, flinging the other end at a human sized target will cause the silk to wrap once around the target's throat and fly back towards the thrower's free hand. Without fail.
* A Husqvarna 385XP gas-powered chainsaw with a 24"" blade; 15lbs, low-vibration, quick-start. Despite being cleaned after its last use, a forensics exam of the chainsaw will reveal specks of human gore and blood.

* A Vietnam-era USMC M2A1-7 flamethrower, perfectly maintained. There are three extra sets of fully-charged cylinders. A three-ring binder contains a photocopy of the official instruction manual, quick-use notes, and details for cleaning, maintaining, restocking and long-term storage of the unit. There are eight notches scratched into the side of the firing trigger.
* An antique Katar punch dagger in bluish steel. The blood runnel seems permanently etched by some acidic liquid.
* A stag handled hunting knife in an old leather sheath. The blade is 6 inches long and has the initials K.R.A. carved onto one side.
* CPS1500 Super Soaker squirt gun. Delivers one liter in 4 seconds, after which pumping is required. Holds 3 liters (4 if the firing chamber is filled too). Range: 40 feet. New in box.

* A modern blow-pipe including half a dozen needle-sharp arrows with tips covered in a dried substance (old, and quite useless, curare). 17 12-Gauge Shells- Loaded with Sea Salt, Silver, and Cold Iron. A steel hand-and-half-sword with sharpened edges. Obviously of modern making and stamped with a small rose that can be traced to the Czech smith Pavel Moc.
* A Nitrochemie/Rheinmetall DM72 ballistic artillery charge turned into a crude time-bomb by the addition of two AA batteries, an egg timer and some American Tape. Looks rough and dangerous.
* A well-honed scythe with a black wooden shaft and a crimson ribbon tied to its handle.
* Three atlatls (spear throwers) made of bone and bundled together by a rubber band. They each have catalog markings from Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History; they were part of a large collection of Native American artifacts that went missing from a storeroom in 1981.

* One Ithaca model 37 ""stakeout"" shotgun, unloaded and wrapped in brittle plastic tarp. The barrel of the weapon is severely pitted and corroded as if it had been subjected to extremely powerful acid. A large tuning fork that, when struck, is audible only to Hounds of Tindalos and may cause them to hesitate before attacking. Collection of 37 dried human ears (all left) on a string necklace
* A computer hard drive (of the internal variety) with a yellow sticker on it that says ""Do NOT connect!"". If it is connected to any kind of Windows controlled hardware a mimetic cryptovirus undetectable by any current anti-virus software will spread from the hard drive and turn all data on the hardware to gibberish.",7,1759873187.0,DeltaGreenRPG,0,1.0,False

* I have a rose that appeared on my Grandmother's rose bush a few days ago.  She died in 2019.  We moved into her house a few months later.  Within a year, the beautiful rose bush that was at least 20 years old was dead.  I am not a good plan person.  I can make a dead plant deader.  Fast forward to present day, briars and all sorts of mess had grown up around the dead rose bush stump.  A couple days ago while walking through my living room, a spot of hot pink caught my eye.  The rose bush has somehow come back to life.  It made me really happy.  I went to buy resin today to preserve the rose.  When I got home and pulled out my resin supplies... surprise... half of the sphere mold I needed to use has disappeared.  
* I also broke out while cutting back the briars.  Who knows what I am allergic to in that mess.  
* The loppers broke.  

My energy is DEAD.  I don't have it in me to do the other organizing and picking up I planned to do.  So my house looks like chaos which is making me anxious. But I don't have the energy to even fix a space to get away from the visual reminders of my to do list all over the house.

But now i kind of like it more than the df64v with dlc burrs. Coffee tastes better. It seems build quality is superior, and I kind of like the old workflow that I had years ago while using a smart grinder pro, you know, time based dosing.
Yeah, it has small retention, but what bothers me is that it takes way more space than the df64v. It also looks a bit weird. 
I also like that it has a switch that also shuts the display off and there are no fking PLASMA GENERATOR SOUNDS, and there is practically zero static. It seems also quieter than the df64v while grinding and sounds better (no squealing sounds).

“Share a photo or short story about what a day in your business looks like.”
👉 This builds authenticity and trust.

2. Customer Value
“What’s one tip or trick your customers could use today that relates to your product or service?”
👉 Helps position you as a helpful expert.

3. Origin Story
“Explain why you started your business in 3 sentences.”
👉 People connect with your why, not just your what.

4. Problem/Solution
“Think of the #1 pain point your customer has. Write a post showing how you help solve it.”
👉 Keeps your content focused on customer needs.

5. Engagement 
“Ask your followers a simple either/or question related to your niche (e.g., coffee vs. tea, DIY vs. hire a pro).”

I wrote a spell for finding a new job. I intend to perform it tomorrow on three people, including myself. I’d like you to read it and give me feedback — what you would improve, whether you think it’s a good spell, what doesn’t align or make sense. I’d be very grateful for your help.

(Also, please forgive my English — it’s not my first language.)


---

Here’s what I wrote:

You will need:

a photo (plus optional DNA),

a printed employment contract template,

a sheet of paper for the petition with the intention and qualities of the desired job,

a marker, a pen,

tweezers,

a green candle,

green or orange thread,

bay leaves.(I’ll write petitions with intentions on them, as if we were pushing luck and that intention into the flame.)

Honey sweetens your image for employers and binds the job offer and employment contract to the person.

Catnip attracts job offers like a magnet.

Marjoram brings wealth and abundance, money.

Allspice guarantees success and prosperity.

Basil attracts business and money.

Cloves ensure the position, the employment contract, hiring, and satisfaction.

Cinnamon brings quick success and abundance.

Coffee speeds up the entire process — offers and calls should appear quickly.

Licorice dominates the workplace and ensures employment.

Poppy ensures that they will see only me — they will see only the person the spell is cast on as the employee.

My own financial oil.Steps in the spell:

1. Dedicate the candle as a manifestation of energy. Carve in the personal data and connect it energetically with the person.


2. Anoint it with the financial oil.


3. Take the photo and the employment contract. Connect them with honey. Smear honey on the photo, saying: “Employers see you sweetly, from a good side.” Stick the contract onto the honeyed photo, saying: “The employment contract sticks to you.”


4. Write a petition — what you want, in one sentence. Write it three times, turn the paper to the right, and write the first and last name three more times.


5. Take green or orange thread and roll the petition three times toward yourself, then tie it to the photo and contract, making seven loops toward yourself.


6. Place the candle on top of that. Create a circle of salt around the candle.


7. Light the candle while focusing on your intention.


8. Add the herbs, saying what they are to do and accomplish.

I always feel awkward, even ashamed (I don't know what for) in these moments but I want to hold my dignity and feel confident. Have you experienced something similar?


Backstory:

Three years ago my (33F) lifelong friend (34F) randomly stopped to reach out to me in every way there is, without blocking me though and when we bump into each other there are these awkward hi's and no chats. The last time I talked to her I was asking if I could drop by her house for a quick coffee but, she was moving that day - to my hometown actually, and responded by saying we'd have a good meet up when she was done with the moving. We never did that meet up and I genuinely have no idea why, she also stopped responding to things I posted on social media. 

We were very close friends from ages 9 to 16. Went separate ways in high school and weren't in the same friend groups in our teenage years although we hade some mutual friends. We regularly kept contact through phonecalls, social media and catched up maybe a few times a year, less and less after we got older, but always kept each other in our friend circles. We were in each other's babyshowers, birthday parties, visited each other when we had our babies and so on. I really valued this friendship, she was my only friend I had from childhood and I could always catch up with her, and her with me,  even after a long time of us both being busy, and it would never be weird or anything. Our communication was always positive. Nothing ever came up that would explain that she suddenly wanted to lock the door on me completely, but I guess we have the right to choose who we want to be friends with. 

This has been very painful for me, I miss her so much I even dream about her regularly. ",1,1759872507.0,AskWomenOver30,5,0.67,False

**Time:** 3-5 minutes

**Type:** Personality style quiz (like Myers Briggs for kink)

# What This Is

I built a kink personality quiz that measures you across 8 different dimensions instead of just giving you Dom/Sub percentages. Think of it like a personality test for your kinky side.

The 8 dimensions are:

* Power exchange
* Pain/intensity
* Sensation play
* Bondage/restraint
* Exhibition/visibility
* Caregiving dynamics
* Service orientation
* Primal energy

You'll get sorted into one of 9 archetypes based on your strongest interest, plus tags for your style (Brat, Protocol lover, Explorer, etc.).

# How It Works

You'll rate statements on a 5 point scale (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree). The quiz adapts as you go. If you're clearly not into something, it skips those detailed questions and moves on.

Takes about 3-5 minutes total.

# What You Get

Immediate results showing:

* Your primary archetype (Power Player, Sensation Seeker, Pain Enthusiast, Bondage Lover, etc.)
* Your full profile across all 8 dimensions
* Your orientation (Dom/Sub/Switch, Top/Bottom, etc.)
* Edge tags that add flavor to your result
* Starter activity suggestions

# Privacy

* No email required to see results
* Anonymous by default
* No data resale
* You can save/share results if you want (totally optional)

# Who Can Take It

Anyone 18+ with any level of kink experience (or just curiosity). You don't need to be active in the community or have any experience at all.

# The ""Research"" Part

I used some academic research and prevalence data to help define the dimensions and make sure I wasn't just making stuff up. But this is primarily a fun personality quiz, not a scientific instrument. Think entertainment value with some educational grounding, not a dissertation.

We did NOT want another cat cause we have three we wouldn’t have kept buuuutttt she’s perfect. She is so nice and outgoing and we all always wanted an orange kitty soooo… 😭 I think she’s super cool especially cause orange cats are usually always male but the vet confirmed she’s a female! Good thing is we have a lot of people in our house to take care of all these pets so the work can be divided a bit but she is my financial responsibility. 

She had her first vet visit today cause we found her over the weekend. She has something going on with her eye, but that doesn’t stop her from constantly purring. She didn’t like the cat carrier but she loved riding in the car, she wouldn’t be quiet unless she was on my lap or the seat purring so I just had to drive carefully. Went through a drive through for some coffee and she was very popular, I told the drive thru  girls I’d come back again next week after her follow up appointment lol 🤣 my other cats don’t like other people and hate riding in the car so it was so sweet, she purrs around everyone she meets and even at the vet. 

We’ve only had her a few days but I love her so much already. No more cats though no matter how cute 😂 I’ll def take her with me when I move out someday! And some of my cats like my bestie Duncan is getting quite old (he’s like 15 or 16) so he won’t be around forever unfortunately even though he’s my son and childhood cat, but luckily for an old man he’s still living his best life! I feel like she embodies some of his spirit to though too cause she is quite friendly, and once they get used to each other I’ll be in cat paradise with the chillest cats ever for a bit! lol.

1o0rriq,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1o0rriq/aunt_speaks_to_my_siblings_but_not_me/,Aunt speaks to my siblings but not me,"Hi all! I have a situation - I am always open to hearing others' point-of-views. 

Main characters: aunt and two sisters (called A and B)  
  
Here are the 'raw' facts:

* 10 years ago, when I was 24, my aunt decided to cut my dad off - her brother. At the time, I had assumed that because she decided not to talk to my dad that she was taking distance from me and my two sisters as well.



* One year later, my aunt decided to reconnect with her brother. When she did this, she also reached out to invite me over. Prior to going to her house, I learned that she had been hanging out with my sisters 1:1 over the last year and that my sisters had also spent time with my cousins - including sleepovers. This left me feeling hurt, shocked, and confused. - (context - I was living with my mom and dad at the time. I can assume that she did not reach out to me over that year because I was living with my dad whereas my sisters were not). My aunt never communicated to me in that year explaining her choice to maintain a relationship with my sisters but not me. 



* Because I had just found out my aunt and cousins were seeing both my sisters often over the last year, I definitely stepped into the hang out with my cousins and aunt feeling rejected. When I arrived, neither of my cousins wanted to hang out with me - which was odd because we had always had so much fun together (in fact, just one year prior!) and the ""hang out"" consisted of me accompanying them and my aunt while doing back-to-school shopping. I left her house feeling odd and uncomfortable because it didn't feel like a normal hangout with people who wanted to spend time with me.



* Some time later, my aunt invited me out for a coffee at a cafe near her house. I took 2 and a half hours of transit to get there and it was fine - though it was a little odd because, for me, family always meant we all spent time together and this was the first time I spent 1:1 time with my aunt and outside of the house. For additional context, I dont think either of my sisters or my parents have ever spent time with my aunt outside of the house - save for maybe going to a playground as kids. 



* For the next couple of years, I didn't see my aunt. I was still feeling odd about the whole thing and, at the time, was living in a one-bedroom apartment with a romantic partner who didn't want us to have guests over. My option was to invite myself over to her house, but I didn't feel comfortable with this as my uncle had hit on me/made very inappropriate comments towards in my mid to late 20s and I was scared to be in a situation where I might end up alone with him. I also didn't want to communicate this to my aunt because I was worried about disrupting her marriage or experiencing backlash. 



* Once I moved into a bigger place and was no longer in a romantic relationship, I invited her over to my house twice - both times, she declined. Then, one day, she offered for me to join her for a walk in the park with her cousin. I am not close with this cousin. He lives about a 10 minute walk from my house. I joined them and, it was fine, but I was left feeling uncomfortable still as, rather than inviting me to spend time 1:1 or to join a hangout with my sisters, I was added to a hang out with someone that I did not have a relationship with. I am also aware that she often sees her cousin and could easily have accepted an invite to my place one day if only to drop in for one hour given how convenient it would be. I am a very intuitive person, so I do trust my instinct that the invite was meant to appeal to my attempts to get together in a 'nice' way without having to dedicate time to me specifically. 



At this point, I realize that I could have asked her about this directly. But, being in my 20s, most of us are not yet comfortable having direct conversations and this was happening within a backdrop of her maintaining a relationships with both of my sisters AND frequently being in my neighbourhood to see my cousin who lived 10 min away. The logical conclusion was that she did not want to spend time with me. 



As a 29 year old, I was left feeling like she genuinely did not want to have a relationship with me. I would also share, again, for context, she had spent time with both my sisters separately either at their house or hers and had a 'normal' flow of a relationship where it's assumed that time will be spent together. 



Fast forward, post-covid, I see my aunt again at a family event that sister B organized. She was nice and, seeing her at other events, I was friendly with her and, on multiple occassions, had nice conversations with her 1:1. I was starting to give her the benefit of the doubt and thought that maybe I could have taken the lead to make plans more frequently in the past even if she did not initiate. I tend to blame myself and take on too much responsibility for other people's actions FYI.



Then, one year ago:

* My aunt invites me to her house along with my sisters - and their kids - and my parents. I was super happy and communicated how happy I was to be invited and that I would definitely love to join to see her.
* A few days before the event, she cancelled because one of my sisters, sister A, was sick (the other sister B RSVPed no and doesn't attend family gatherings much...she is close with my aunt and spends more 1:1 time with her). I thought it was odd because my parents and I had RSVPed yes. This would also be the first time I was invited to her house in several years. I had the feeling that she had only wanted to see sister A and that was why she cancelled. Although I had this quick feeling and thought, I didn;t think about it again and genuinely thought this was all a misunderstanding and things were back to normal. 
* A few months later, she invited me to her house again. I communicated that I was incredibly grateful to be invited, but that I had plans with a friend. I said that if my plans fell through, I would definitely join and would love to be there. I offered her other weekends when I was free if she wanted to get together. She responded, ""Too bad. Next time!""
* This seemed dismissive, particularly since I shared that I would attend if my plans fell through and offered other times to get together.
* After this happened, I mentioned it to my sister A casually because it seemed odd. She shared, oh, last summer, I had a conversation with our aunt telling her that I felt uncomfortable being invited to her house without you, Sister B and my parents. I shared that we used to always spend time as a family unit and the sudden switch to 1:1 relationships felt weird. I said, in the future, if you invite me over, it needs to be with me, my parents, and both my sisters. 
* Once I learned this (and learned that my aunt only invited me after confirming Sister A's availability), it felt disgenious. If there was any past misunderstanding and a genuine desire to form a relationship with me, she would have seen all of my positive reactions around being invited and my attempt to schedule an invite and could have responded positively to my desire and efforts to get together. She chose not to.  

At 34, I am very comfortable having open and direct conversations with people to resolve conflict collaboratively and with love and understanding. I find it actually makes the relationship stronger. In this case, I chose not to confront my aunt directly because (1) we don't have any relationship upon which we build, (2) her decision to invite me appeared to be a direct result of Sister A stating my inclusion as a pre-condition in her going to my aunt's house, and (3) my limit with people is that if I can't even secure time with you, there is not even an opportunity to have a conversation and you can't fight for a relationship that does not exist.

Also, I felt that if my aunt's decision to include me was due to Sister A stating it as a necessity for my aunt to see sister A, my aunt might tell me what I wanted to hear in order to maintain her relationship with sister A. In essence, her recent actions created distrust and were a continuation of the lack of interest I have felt over the last decade. 

  
For further context, my sister has two cute and adorable kids. I had been picking up on a vibe that her desire to maintain a relationship with Sister A was partly to get close to the kids. My life partner also picked up on that vibe - neither of us has kids. 

Two months later, my sister had a birthday party for my neice, my aunt does not say hi to me even though I say hi to her and was directly in her face. She left the party early. I nicely asked what plans she had and she explained she is going to see a cousin. This is a distant cousin that she only knew existed 7 years ago. It struck me that she was able to build a relationship with a NEW relative while not putting an effort into her relationship with her niece. This distant cousin lives even further away so she has put the commitment and effort into this relationship.

  
After this event, I was crying for days. The relationship had really hurt me in the past and I had been dealing with the rejection for years, but it reached a breaking point for me. In combination with this experience and my experience with my uncle, who was inappropriate with me on a few occassions, I told sister A that I needed to opt out of family events for the time being.

  
After a lot of tears and tough conversations, sister A and I decided that the best course forward was not to include our aunt at the next birthday event in order to give me a space where I felt safe and because her and I are incredibly close and it was the best for the kids given how close I am to them. We agreed that Sister A would speak to my aunt directly and let her know and I shared that, although I would not initate with my aunt directly, I was open to having a conversation with her if she expressed interest. I also shared that because of her recent disingenous behaviours, I did not trust that any attempt from her to smooth things over would reflect her care for me, but instead may reflect her desire to maintain a good relationship with Sister A. I said I would stay open in the future but that, at this point, it would not be resolved through one conversation. 

  
I typically tolerate a lot from others and am willing to self-sacrifice for people I love. However, after experiencing extreme self-isolation during the pandemic where I lived alone and my family did not talk to me (longer story), I have become incredibly sensitive to being around people - particularly if it is family - that do not care about me. Even if I cognitively am aware that my aunt's behaviour is not a reflection of me, I am filled with anxiety and pain at the thought of seeing her. Outside of this context, I am known to be emotionally stable, emotionally mature, and resilient (one of the most common pieces of FB I hear from friends and good relatives).

  
After all of this, sister B has accused both me and sister A of 'being in the wrong' and not being inclusive. She believes this exclusion is unwarranted (even if Sister A maintains a relationship with my aunt on her own and it's only her kids' birthday parties that my aunt would not be invited to). She claims that this decision will damage Sister A's kids' relationship with their great aunt and her two kids - who are both adults in their 20s btw. She says that she does not stand by this decision.

  
The whole situation is complicated by my uncle's inappropriate behaviour towards me as an 'attractive woman' and any risk that poses to my niece as she matures.  

Would love to hear your thoughts on the healthy way to navigate this situation. ",1,1759872276.0,family,1,1.0,False

Studio Divisions

Each division would have its own aesthetic, leadership, and style — like how Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm all live under Disney but have distinct DNA.

1. SAPPHIC STUDIOS

For lesbian, bisexual women, and queer feminine stories.
Genres: Romance, drama, comedy, sci-fi, thriller, slice-of-life.
Flagship Shows (examples):
	•	“Coastal Heat” – Two women rebuilding their lives in a seaside town uncover a decades-old love story that mirrors their own.
	•	“The Crew” – A lesbian-led Formula racing drama (because why not give lesbians the Drive to Survive treatment?).

2. HORIZON FILMS

For gay male and queer masculine stories.
Genres: Comedy, action, mystery, romance, musical.
Flagship Shows:
	•	“King Street” – Found family drama set in a city drag bar where everyone’s fighting their own battles.
	•	“The Agency” – Gay spy thriller with heart and high stakes.

3. FLUID MEDIA

For bisexual and pansexual storytelling, often exploring complexity and identity fluidity.
Genres: Psychological drama, romance, fantasy, sci-fi.
Flagship Show:
	•	“Split Screen” – A bisexual filmmaker struggles to separate her art from her messy love life — until her movies start mirroring her reality.

4. BEYOND STUDIOS

For trans, nonbinary, and gender-expansive creators and stories.
Genres: Everything. Representation here is front and center, not background.
Flagship Show:
	•	“Ecliptic” – A trans-led cyberpunk series about identity in the age of digital consciousness.

⸻

💡 Unique Features
	•	Creator Equity Program – Queer writers, directors, and producers own part of their IP.
	•	Community Curation – Viewers can vote for projects to greenlight each season.
	•	Genre Hubs – Romance, sci-fi, horror, drama, comedy, all within each identity category.
	•	Pride Premieres – Global streaming events each Pride season highlighting new films.


🔞 Audience Ratings System

Like Netflix or Hulu, Spectrum Studios would have a built-in rating structure — not to restrict content, but to guide viewers and make sure every kind of queer story has a home.

🌟 P13 (Parental Guidance 13)
	•	Light, heartfelt, or coming-of-age stories.
	•	Clean romance, friendship themes, slice-of-life comedies.
	•	Great for younger queer audiences exploring identity in a safe space.

Examples:
	•	“Heartwired” – Teen girls bond over coding club and crushes.
	•	“The Queens of Middle School” – A PG-rated animated comedy about drag-inspired creativity and self-expression.

⸻

💞 PG / PG-15
	•	Romantic comedies, musical dramas, found-family series.
	•	Deals with love, identity, and emotion — mild language, limited intimacy.

Examples:
	•	“Sunset Coffee” – Two college girls running a coffee cart fall for each other while competing for a small business grant.
	•	“Roommates” – Queer coming-of-age dramedy about four best friends trying to survive adulthood.

⸻

🔥 R-Rated
	•	Mature romance, emotional drama, thrillers, and raw stories exploring complex relationships and identity.
	•	Realistic portrayals of sex, heartbreak, trauma, and self-discovery.

Examples:
	•	“Velvet Heat” – A lesbian firefighter drama where passion and danger collide.
	•	“The Fall of Eden” – Gay gothic romance set in a repressed 19th-century town.

⸻

🖤 M for Mature
	•	Darker, boundary-pushing, or experimental storytelling.
	•	Horror, erotic thrillers, psychological dramas, adult humor.
	•	Explicit themes handled with artistic integrity and purpose.

Examples:
	•	“Hunger” – Erotic vampire series exploring power, obsession, and queer desire.
	•	“Subtext” – Meta anthology about queer intimacy in digital and real worlds.

⸻

A bit about me:

I loooooove anything to do with the outdoors (activities, wildlife, the environment, etc) and I'd have to say I feel most at peace when I'm outside. I'd love to find someone to join a run club with, or to accompany me out on trails and hikes or literally anything else outdoorsy. 

I love movies, gaming, reading, and most things artsy. 

If I had to pick tea or coffee, it's gotta be coffee. 

And another thing about me is that I do thoroughly enjoy a deep, meaningful chat every so often. I'm quite an empathetic, caring person and I do value getting to share more intimate thoughts and opinions.

1) Expenses: when I bought my flight in January I barely knew anything about the country, a quick search told me it was going to be expensive. So, budget was usd 3.210 (a total of 4k if adding the flights). I live in a country where every foreign expense is paid in USD, so I was exposed to isk/usd variations and then usd/my local currency. From January to sep, rates were like 15% higher, was making me nervous. In the end, the real expense was usd 2.743: 
  - usd 1.315 rental car. Booked with Zero a used Dacia duster, full insurance, and they gave me a Suzuki Vitara. Used road assistance once and had two chips in windshield, all covered.
  - Drove 2.940 km, clockwise, and fueled up 8 times for a total of usd 445. Budget was 600, so it was good. I used gsmbensin to map the cheapest (mostly orkan) stations along my route, then managed to compensate the high prices from akureyri to hofn. 
  - 900usd in accommodation. I slept in hostels (once in 10bed room, others 4bed), guesthouses (private room, shared bathroom) and room in house with Airbnb. Every night I was sleeping in a different place, except for two nights spent near Laugar. This was feeling tiring by the end. Booked everything around may/June, and prices range between 52-90 usd, except one night near Skaftafell for 120usd. 
  - 94 usd in parking. Payed everything with the machine in place or parka website (they charge a 86 krn fee). 
- 133 usd in food. Bought most of my food in kronan and bonus, mostly vegetables and fruit, bread and peanut butter, milk, a couple of pizzas, sandwich meat/cheese and eggs. From home I brought pasta, crackers, tea, coffee, instant soup, trail mix. Brought my thermos and used it everyday for coffee mid morning, soup, or a tea mid afternoon. Oh and brought a bottle of wine in my checked bag. Outside of that were just two hot dogs and the breakfast at KEF. So in total may be 150usd.
  -12 usd esim from Airalo. Got 5gb and used it at 95%. 
  - 0 usd on tours/activities. Originally I was planning on doing the cave in Snaefellness but that day was under yellow alert and I was focusing on getting to my accomm in Olafsvik, so passed it. Also planned on doing the fjallsarlon boat tour, but waited till last minute and was doing other things, so missed it. My schedule included going back the next morning to glacier area, but wind alert changed plans and had to kept going towards vik. 

Some thoughts: 
- even though the distances weren't long in terms of km, changing from paved to gravel (some roads are pretty bad), some parts being pretty plain in terms of sights, and/or driving under winding/raining conditions, and being just me, got me tired. I don't think I ever drove more than 1.30hs/2 hs without stopping though. And in total for a day wasn't past 4 or 5 hours. 
- the part from myvatn to skaftafell was just so so beautiful. A combination of sun and clouds gave the landscape such a mood, and with the colors changing from green to yellow/orange/red, it was awesome. I was nervous about the part from Eggilstadir to Seydisfjordur, but omg, definitely my favourite. Also troll peninsula, very pretty. 
- was lucky to see the northern lights up north, for 3 nights in a row. And didn't have to stay until late. One night they were so strong that were green and dancing in bare eye. I used the Aurora app, but didn't rely on getting notifications to go out, it was mainly to see if people were seeing anything in my area. Also checked Facebook group northern lights iceland. 
- checked weather, mainly wind and precipitation, using vedur website. Have the app but it doesn't show all the info. Also for road.is. 
- when driving saw so many cars with the lights in auto, even under heavy rain. TURN THE LIGHTS ONNNNNN FFS! You are not been seen from behind either. Grey pavement, grey car, grey day, poor visibility due to the rain, not a great combination. Also on the other extreme, if you're not comfortable with driving at night, then don't. Don't go driving with the high beams, you're blinding the driver that's on the other side. Just use the sticks as guidance, drive slow, or wait until daylight. 
- please take the trash with you. It's disgusting to see toilet paper, Kleenex, pads, coffee cups tossed around. 
- respect the signs. It seems that some people cant even understand a picture. Stay on track, don't go pass the ropes, don't fly the drone. 
- never used the credit card pin. Just payed everything with Google pay, except for once when I had to insert my card in the machine, but it got approved immediately. Every time I put gas, there was a hold of 250usd (30k krn), and after 2 or 3 days the real expense appeared in my card. 

I think that's all. Thanks to the people in this group! I like reading other experiences and advices, and really helped me prepare for my trip.

The intent of this document is to provide a brief guide for the Revelations cards of Persona 5: The Phantom X: what they are, how they work, and what stats you can find on them. I will also provide some recommendations for what cards to collect as you sift through the vast number of cards you'll run into over time.

# Revelations Cards Basics

Revelations cards are items that you collect for your Phantom Thieves in P5X. Each card has a quality (white, blue, purple, or orange), a level (0-25), a main stat (two for Space cards), and substats.

Revelation cards have different level caps according to their color: 15 for blue, 20 for purple, 25 for orange. I suspect white has a cap of 10, but I've never actually leveled one to confirm.

Each Phantom Thief should end up with five cards at a time, with five specific slots per character:

* Space
* Sun
* Moon
* Star
* Sky (looks like the planet Saturn)

Revelations cards come in named sets. Some sets are specific to the Space slot only, like Integrity and Trust. The other sets are found across the other four card slots. Each set has a different visual design.

Each four-card set comes with two set bonuses on top of the stats they provide. One of the bonuses is for having two-of-a-set, the other for four-of-a-set. So far, there has not been a recommended setup that mixes the two-card set bonuses, so you will always want to have four-of-a-set on your characters.

Each Space card has specific four-card sets that it interacts with, and it provides an additional set bonus when paired with one of those sets. **Trust**, for instance, is a space card that can be used with the Prosperity, Power, or Renewal four-card sets.

# Revelation Card Main Stats

A Revelation card's main stat is the only stat on the card that is guaranteed to increase every time you level the card. The main stat's growth is also predictable and consistent across cards; for any Revelation cards that have the same slot, same color/quality, same level, and same main stat, the main stat value will be the same for both.

Each card slot has a different set of main stats possible.

* All Space cards have the same two main stats, each of which are flat amounts: Attack and Defense.
* All Sun cards have the same main stat, a flat amount of HP.
* Moon cards have one of the following five main stats: Attack %, Defense %, HP %, Attack Mult, or HP Recovery (Healing).
* Star cards have one of the following six main stats: Attack %, Defense %, HP %, Crit Rate, Crit Mult, or Ailment Accuracy.
* Sky cards have one of the following five main stats: Attack %, Defense %, HP %, SP Recovery, or Speed.

# Revelation Card Substats

In addition to the main stat, a Revelation card will have a group of substats (up to four). Most of the cards you'll want to keep will have four stats. Some purple and orange cards will *start* with three substats, with a fourth that will be revealed when the card is brought to level 5 or higher.

These substats are allocated randomly, and they can include:

* Attack (flat amount)
* Attack %
* Defense (flat amount)
* Defense %
* HP (flat amount)
* HP %
* Attack Mult
* Crit Rate
* Crit Mult
* Pierce Rate
* SP Recovery
* Ailment Accuracy
* Speed

At every five levels, a card will increase one of its substats (though for the cards that start with three stats, they will instead add their fourth). It is not predictable as to *which* substat will receive the increase.

You may have come across **Retrograde Cards**; these will let you un-level a revelation card, allowing the substat bonuses (and fourth substat, if applicable) to be reset, and granting the user leveling materials equivalent to the card experience removed. These cards have limited but sometimes valuable use, especially if a card with three useful substats and one less-useful substat seems to be giving all its bonuses to the least useful substat.

# Where to Get Them

The cards that fit in the Sun, Moon, Star, and Sky slots are all readily available in the Realm of Repression. Each ROR session you run will give you a random assortment of cards, with each coming from one of two card sets (depending on the ROR activity you chose). The quality of these cards improves as you level up, with ROR sessions at level 80 providing much better rewards than at 70 and so on.

Space cards are a bit less reliable to obtain. Occasionally you will get random space cards as gifts or prizes for completing game goals. Random space cards of orange quality can be purchased in the Exchange at the Land of Fortune shop, and both orange and purple space cards can be purchased in the Companio shop.

Sometimes you will even get an item that lets you choose a specific space card by set, though its substats will still be randomized.

If you need a predictable source of space cards, the Companio shop also sells blue-quality cards by name. These won't have the best stats, and their lower level cap limits their usefulness, but they are a reliable means of making sure you can complete a named set correctly.

# How to Level Them

The ""Enhance"" option within the Revelations card interface will let you level a card up. You can consume Sun, Moon, or Star crystals; they grant 1000, 250, or 50 experience respectively. You can also consume *other* revelation cards that you don't need.

Additionally, you can consume revelations cards that have been partially or fully leveled. In addition to the value of the card itself, these will also provide a partial amount of the experience used to level the card consumed.

In general you want to be careful about this approach, as you can end up wasting resources. I do tend to find that leveling up a card to 5 to get its fourth substat to be revealed is typically a good measure from a risk/benefit standpoint; you don't lose too much experience in the process if you end up feeding that level 5 card to something else later.

**I also recommend leveling Revelations Cards slowly**. Make sure you have wide coverage before you start building out most cards up to 25. The later levels get *much* more expensive.

I recommend working up most/all of your cards by 5-level increments in parallel: four level 5 cards are less costly than a single level 20 card (and will likely yield better overall results). If you're trying out a new strategy or set, you can usually get a decent feel for whether the set will work at all while it's still low-leveled. After you confirm that, *then* come back and throw more experience at it.

# Locking Cards

The question of which cards to keep, and which to consume, gets very complicated. I'll provide some guidance in a later section regarding specific card sets. However, one feature to take advantage of is the ""lock"" mechanism. When in the Revelations card interface you select a card that you know (or suspect) that you may keep, look for the little padlock icon at the bottom left of the card's title bar. Tapping this icon will lock and unlock a card.

A locked card can still be equipped and leveled, but it will not show up when looking at potential cards to consume when leveling other cards.

# Vicissitude Ink

Vicissitude Ink is a relatively new feature on global, available in rare quantities. It lets you create a new orange card for a sun, moon, star, or sky slot. It lets you pick the card set and the main stat for the card (which means you really shouldn't bother with it for sun cards). If after you've been grinding for cards for a while, you just *cannot* get a correct main stat for one slot, this is a good last resort.

For instance, I could not, for whatever reason, get a Sky Virtue card for Tropical Motoha that had Attack as its main stat, neither purple or orange. This was after *repeated* attempts at ROR over the course of weeks. When I finally pulled her and still didn't have a card for that slot, then I used the ink.

Because it's rare, use it sparingly.

# Which Cards to Keep: An Introduction

This section won't give thorough advice for every character and card possibility. You are much better off going to [Lufel.net](https://lufel.net/character/?lang=en) for those details, which you can find on each character's page. I do, however, have some good rules of thumb.

**1. Keep all Space cards until you are absolutely sure**

This is pretty straightforward. Keep every space card you get until you're 100% sure you don't need it and will never need it. Usually, the ""don't need it"" point arises when you already have a bunch of those cards and at higher quality or with better stats. If you aren't sure, don't trash it.

**2. It's OK to trash all white cards and most blue cards**

Except for blue Space cards, which are a special case, you usually don't need any white or blue cards. Early on when you're leveling, you *may* occasionally need a blue card in a sun/moon/star/sky slot to complete a set. But it's rarely worthwhile to keep white cards, and the vast majority of time you won't need the blue ones.

**3. Keep** ***at least*** **one purple or orange sky card with Speed as the main stat per named set**

Speed is the stat used to set ally turn order, and there are a number of situations where you have to shuffle that around for an optimal strategy. Keeping some speed main stat cards, even if you don't level them immediately, can make that much less of a headache (especially when you need to move a character forward that would normally be last).

**4. Keep Speed off of elucidator cards** ***unless*** **a specific character needs them**

Right now, the only elucidator that actually uses Speed is Wind. Speed is the only stat that isn't shared by elucidators with the rest of the group, but Wind has some additional mechanics that make it valuable. Speed is a waste of space on elucidator cards other than hers.

**5. SP Recovery is currently a bit of a waste generally**

There are some occasions where you'll want this substat, and sometimes you just have to put up with it on a card that has *other* great substats. There will eventually be characters that actually use SPR like a secondary or main stat. But for now, it's a very niche stat, most useful on healers but rarely actually *needed* even there.

# Card Advice Set by Set

This section has to do with building your card library, ensuring that you keep around cards that may be useful in the future, and freeing you up to trash/consume the ones you don't need. Each named set has different needs and uses, with some much more limited.

In general, my guidance (when you're starting out) is to look for the following:

* Space and Sun cards that have at least two desirable substats for the target character(s)
* Moon, Star, and Sky cards that have a desirable main stat and at least one desirable substat for the target character(s).

While orange cards are better than purple ones overall, keep in mind that a purple card with a correct main stat is going to be better than an orange card with an incorrect one. Occasionally a purple card's substats may even be worth forgoing the value of a comparable orange card's main stat. It's all a bit wishy-washy, but it's worth keeping purples around until you're sure you're set for all the gold cards you need in that set/slot.

Be on the lookout for ""DPS substats"" in your cards. These are Pierce, Attack, Attack Mult, Crit Rate, and Crit Mult. While not every one of these stats has the same value for every character, they are generally the ones you want to look out for when setting up most characters, as even many support characters can also benefit from these substats.

For specific substat advice per character, check [Lufel.net](https://lufel.net/character/?lang=en).

**Truth**

This set is used by Nuclear characters, particularly Vino (Harmony Truth) and Queen (Awareness Truth). Leon doesn't tend to use Truth, so you can ignore him.

For Truth cards, look for DPS substats in each slot. For Vino, you'll also want Ailment Accuracy and Speed.

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Attack and Attack Mult.
* Star: Crit Rate, Crit Mult, and Ailment Acc (*Attack if you're struggling to get something better*).
* Sky: Attack and Speed.

**Control**

Awareness Control is a standard set for Key and is occasionally even used by Soy (when part of a ""fire team""). However, Departure Control is a set that kinda floats around, used by various types of support characters (though usually not DPS).

As a result, you probably want a wider variety of stats for your Control cards, and you will probably want to maintain several sets of them.

Control cards are sometimes used by characters that use Attack as a main stat, but often they are found on characters that derive their abilities from HP or Defense instead. These characters currently include Key, Soy, Marian, Fox, and Yukimi (though Fox would probably use a different card set).

When keeping Moon, Star, or Sky cards that have an HP substat, for instance, be on the lookout for cards that *don't* include Attack as a substat. Attack is nearly useless on Soy, Key, or Marian. It won't hurt anything to have it, but something like Crit, HP, Attack Mult, or even Defense may serve you better.

Main stats to care about?

* Basically all of them.

You definitely want a few Sky cards with Speed as the main stat. You want at least one HP Recovery card in the Moon slot. Defense main stat cards are a lower priority, as Yukimi rarely uses Control, but you might want one per slot anyway.

**Hindrance**

This set amplifies curse damage. Joker will use it, either paired with Awareness (for when all enemy targets are immortal) or Departure (when at least two enemy targets in the fight will die, as is the case for most Joker-oriented boss fights).

You can also put together a set of Awareness Hindrance for Sumi and Rin, though Rin will more often be using something else.

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Attack and Attack Mult.
* Star: Crit Rate, Crit Mult, Attack, and Ailment Acc.
* Sky: Attack and Speed.

**Prosperity**

Prosperity may be the single most-used card set (and the single most swapped around). You frequently need at least one set of Prosperity for a boss fight, though no *more* than one Prosperity set (as its Highlight and attack bonuses don't stack).

Support characters that perform skills that target allies at least once every other turn (Leon, healers, Chord, etc.) can use Trust Prosperity, while supporting characters that instead do some form of attack *every* turn (Vino, Rin) use Departure Prosperity. Trust Prosperity is also a useful option for certain elucidators like Okyann and Puppet, so long as you're okay missing out on the damage buff in the first turn.

As with Control cards, you will want a wide variety of main stats. Nearly every main stat has a potential use for a character that might use a Prosperity set. The one exception is Defense, since usually Yukimi would be kitted out with something else.

**Opulence**

Right now the Opulence set, which increases ice damage and follow-up attack damage, is really only used by two characters: Fox and Kotone (Mont). Fox is recommended to have Meditation Opulence, while Kotone can have either Meditation Opulence or Growth Opulence.

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Attack, Attack Mult, and Defense.
* Star: Crit Rate and Crit Mult (*Defense or Attack for Fox or Kotone in a pinch*).
* Sky: Attack, Defense, and Speed.

Remember that Fox does not benefit from Attack, though he does benefit from Attack Mult.

**Renewal**

Renewal is the electric set, and it is used currently by Yui and Closer. Yui should always use Growth Renewal, while Closer uses Trust Renewal.

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Attack and Attack Mult.
* Star: Crit Rate, Crit Mult, and Ailment Accuracy (*this last one is for specific cases where you need Closer to be a reliable shocker*).
* Sky: Attack and Speed.

**Power**

Another portable set! Power is a generic attack-amplifying set used by elucidators and support units. You can have multiple Power characters in the same team, but make sure you have no more than one Trust Power and no more than one Harmony Power.

The most common use case for Trust Power is on an attack-based support character, though you will sometimes find Harmony Power recommended outside of attack-based characters of particular elements (like putting it on Marian to increase bless damage).

However, typically it's an Attack set.

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Attack. *Sometimes* Attack Mult or HP.
* Star: Attack. *Sometimes* Crit of some kind or HP. Ailment Accuracy very rarely.
* Sky: Attack and Speed. *Sometimes* HP.

You *may* also want to put Trust Power on Puppet, so you'd need Defense main stats, though generally there are better options.

**Oppression**

This is Messa's set, but we don't have him quite yet. It amplifies physical damage and ailment accuracy. Because of the ailment accuracy boost, there's apparently a configuration appropriate to Sumi as well, though that appears to be a niche setup (and he won't use the bonuses to physical damage).

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Attack. (*Attack Mult for the weird Sumi setup*)
* Star: Attack. (*Ailment Acc for Sumi*)
* Sky: Attack and Speed.

**Pleasure**

This psy set is intended for Haru, who isn't on global servers yet. She will probably use Wisdom Pleasure, as she benefits from Ailment Accuracy. By the time this article is posted, Seaside Tomoko will be available on global servers (or will be shortly). She will more likely run other sets (like Trust Prosperity), but Integrity Pleasure is an option for her as well, especially if you intend to use her as a quasi-DPS. Lufel doesn't list it as a recommended set, but it does appear to be designed with her in mind.

You can also put Wisdom Pleasure on regular four-star Tomoko, like if you need to increase her damage in the Velvet Trials.

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Attack Mult for Haru (*Attack in a pinch*). HP Recovery or Attack for Seaside Tomoko.
* Star: Crit Rate, Ailment Acc, and Attack.
* Sky: Attack and Speed.

**Virtue**

This is a bless damage set for Tropical Motoha and Yoshizawa (Violet).

As of this writing, there's currently a mistranslation in the text for Wisdom Virtue that says a buff occurs *after* a highlight. In reality, this buff only occurs *during* a highlight. Yoshizawa's highlight is a bit different than other characters and can stretch over a longer period, so Wisdom Virtue is intended for her. Resolve Virtue is what you want for Tropical Motoha.

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Attack and Attack Mult.
* Star: Crit Rate and Crit Mult (*Attack in a pinch*).
* Sky: Attack and Speed.

**Courage**

This is a set that increase both physical and electric damage. It is only currently used by Skull (Meditation Courage). Skull is one of few DPS that can basically ignore Crit Rate, since his most powerful attack automatically crits (and is computed as 100% CR for final damage in SOS and such).

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Attack and Attack Mult.
* Star: Crit Mult.
* Sky: Attack and Speed (*though Speed is unlikely to be needed*)

**Love**

The game recommends this set for healers, but frankly you can skip it. Your healers nearly always have plenty of capability to heal without these cards, and they're usually better equipped with something else.

If you want to collect them anyway:

* Moon: HP Recovery and Attack.
* Star: Attack.
* Sky: Attack and Speed.

**Peace**

These cards are defense amplifiers and are best used by Puppet (Faith Peace) and Yukimi (either Faith Peace or Acceptance Peace). Sometimes they'll float over to someone like Leon, but rarely.

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Defense
* Star: Defense, Crit Rate, and Crit Mult.
* Sky: Defense and Speed.

It's possible you may want to tweak these further, adding Attack or HP if using them for Puppet (since the team inherits a portion of most elucidator stats). But usually it's not worth it; just keep it as a defense set.

**Victory**

This is a wind damage set intended for Fleuret (Harmony Victory). Apparently there's a niche usage for Seaside Tomoko as well, though she won't benefit from the wind bonus.

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Attack and Attack Mult (*maybe HP Recovery for Tomoko*).
* Star: Crit Mult and Crit Rate.
* Sky: Attack and Speed.

**Labor**

This is an elucidator-only set. Use Resolve Labor on debuff-based elucidators (Wind) and Integrity Labor on buff-based elucidators (Phoebe, Puppet, Okyann).

Among elucidators currently in global, only Wind uses Speed; you *want* speed for her stats and substats, though you want to *avoid* speed on everyone else.

Because Elucidators share their stats with the team, it's not always a bad idea to put stats on them that aren't their main stat. Generally, though, you'll want to reserve Defense cards for Puppet.

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Attack and Defense, *maybe* Attack Mult.
* Star: Attack, Defense, Crit Rate, Crit Mult, and Ailment Accuracy (*the last probably rarely*).
* Sky: Attack, Defense, and Speed

**Strife**

This fire-based set is for Ann (Acceptance Strife).

Main stats to care about:

* Moon: Attack and Attack Mult.
* Star: Crit Mult and Crit Rate.
* Sky: Attack and Speed (*though very unlikely*).

# Conclusion

Phew, that's a lot of cards. And there are more coming! But hopefully that should give you some guidance for the sorts of cards to lock and save for current and future characters. Please let me know in the comments if you spot an error, and I'll try and fix it.

The Revelations Cards are the most tweaky, random-numbery parts of character progression. The stats they provide, because they are so random and varied, are what will make *your* character different from everyone else's of the same type, even if other factors are the same.

I advise you not to immediately go grinding for *the* perfect card. That way leads to madness. Eventually you'll come to a point where tiny incremental improvements like that are all you have left, but more often what you need are *good* cards, not stellar amazing ones. Once you have enough of a variety of *good* cards, then you can start chugging coffee aids and grinding ROR.",22,1759871370.0,personaphantomx,4,1.0,False

After working with various doctors over five years who could offer only incremental improvement at best (and drastic setbacks at worst), it occurred to me to try giving an AI/LLM a crack at solving my brain fog.

I asked Claude AI to look at my medical history and ask me follow up questions with the goal of narrowing down the possibilities to a handful of testable hypotheses and questions I could bring to my medical providers.  Claude immediately offered a handful of ideas and a treatment plan for the most likely candidate that would also be diagnostic if I experienced subsequent improvement. Claude's highest probability hypothesis was that I have a vitamin B1/thiamin deficiency caused by chronic SIBO, and he recommended a handful of supplements which I ordered immediately since I had nothing to lose.  Within 3 hours after taking the first thiamin capsule, I noticed dramatic changes including the sudden emergence of long lost libido and the ability to enjoy my coffee (I've been dispassionately noticing how my coffee tastes every morning, but I it's been a long time since I experienced anything like enjoyment.)

The idea of a thiamin deficiency was never proposed as a possibility by any of the 10+ physicians with whom I have discussed my symptoms over the last 5 years, but Claude's first guess seems to be at least a major factor for me if not the entire cause of my brain fog (which remains to be seen).

YMMV, obviously, but it might be worth giving an AI a crack at it.

Food & Drink Experiences – small bites, cocktails, or coffee tastings
Creative Nights – art, crafts, or DIY activities
Men’s Meetups – chill nights or activity-focused events just for guys
Women’s Meetups – casual hangouts or themed socials for women
Student Meetups – fun ways for students to meet and connect
Travel & Adventure Hangouts – travel stories, dream destinations, and planning trips together
Book & Podcast Clubs – discussions about books, podcasts, or learning new skills
Career & Networking Meetups – industry chats, ambitions, casual career advice
Fitness & Wellness Events – yoga, running clubs, meditation circles, or wellness workshops
Pet & Animal Lovers Meetups – dog walks, cat cafe visits, or pet-themed socials
Tech & Gaming Meetups – gadgets, apps, esports, VR, or board games
Spirituality & Personal Growth Nights – meditation, astrology, philosophy, or reflection circles
Sports Nights – playing sports, watching games, or cheering on teams together

**Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click :**  
I’m a 20 year old, I have ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading: *Het gouden ei* by Tim Krabbé), journaling, baking, crafting. I love making a million playlists for every mood or vibe and end up never listening to them again (and then hoarding them on my iPod). I don’t enjoy watching movies but am into series (currently: *Lang Leve de Liefde*, *KOTH*). I love going to cafés and drinking too much coffee or tea. I like playing online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes, reading Wikipedia articles and just chilling in the sun doing whatever. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. I am up for talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click!

And [in case you missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Torontoevents/comments/1npm1oc/events_to_help_you_meet_new_people_explore_the/), here's some background:

Hey Toronto Redditors!

We're Denys & Dan, and have been living in and around this amazing city for years,but noticed a common theme: there are so many cool things to do, but it's not always easy to find a group to do them with! We've both tried attending various events and using social apps, but often feel like there's a missing piece when it comes to truly fostering genuine connection.

That's why **we're launching a new series of events designed to bring people together, inspire new friendships, and explore the best of Toronto**. Think of it as a low-pressure way to meet like-minded individuals and discover new experiences, without the awkwardness!

# A little about us:

* **Denys:** I moved to Toronto with my parents when I was 4 and have lived here ever since. I love to travel and spend time outdoors. Whether it be running, biking or just strolling around, you will almost never find me inside (expect when I am working).

1o0r3c4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o0r3c4,Want input from cholesterol trackies,"Im looking for all thoughts and ideas. Ask away. Im really am keen to research here whats going on and explore some potential unheard of options. Hoping  you can give me some things to consider and investigate further beside all the main info regarding cholesterol. 

I am generally considered very healthy and fit and have been my entire life. I eat very clean. No sugar, healthy carbs mostly in the form of veggies, basically zero saturated fat, cook most meals from scratch, primarily vegetarian (lots of greens, peppers, mushrooms, lentils, beans, onions, tomatoes etc), some fruit daily and almost never use / ingest butter or animal fats. Not a fan of red meat, so when I do eat meat (which is not common) it’s usually chicken. I do eat eggs but not a wild amount, maybe 1x a week. I am a coffee drinker and other than that occasionally have a glass of orange juice. Otherwise it’s water all the way. I rarely drink alcohol. 

I have no family history of high cholesterol. 

I workout 4x a week strength training, HIT, weight lifting, cardio  and supplement with yoga. 

Im a woman, late 30’s, 5’9, weight fluctuates between 125lb - 135lb on average. Recently gained some weight due to a pregnancy that is no longer so I’m at 139lbs. BMI is 20%. Body fat % is 21 right now. Would like to see that go down to about 18-19%, as that has generally been my avg. 

Anyway, I have high cholesterol since first tested last year. Every recommendation by my dr has not resulted in change. In fact, it went up! He does not believe I should take a statin. No family history as said Negative FH. Lifestyle factors seem not to be an issue. Im pretty low stress and spend a lot of time doing things I enjoy. I have no underlying known disorders. Thyroid is at ideal levels. Hormones all normal. I am on birth control (the ring) and I do have children. No issues during pregnancy. No diabetes. I do have lower oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, but not out of range. And I do right now have lower iron levels but that seems to be related to recent pregnancy loss.

Hey Toronto Redditors!

We're Denys & Dan, and have been living in and around this amazing city for years,but noticed a common theme: there are so many cool things to do, but it's not always easy to find a group to do them with! We've both tried attending various events and using social apps, but often feel like there's a missing piece when it comes to truly fostering genuine connection.

That's why **we're launching a new series of events designed to bring people together, inspire new friendships, and explore the best of Toronto**. Think of it as a low-pressure way to meet like-minded individuals and discover new experiences, without the awkwardness!

# A little about us:

* **Denys:** I moved to Toronto with my parents when I was 4 and have lived here ever since. I love to travel and spend time outdoors. Whether it be running, biking or just strolling around, you will almost never find me inside (expect when I am working). Furthermore, over the last couple of years, I have turned into a bit of a coffee addict, and now know almost every cafe in the city.

I wanted to share my 1-year long socializing journey with your guys. I am 27 yo, and I’ve started the journey 13 months ago. I have to say I have been through a lot more than I thought I will in a year. Started as a completely anti-social person, much of it is still left in me today, but the journey has been amazing. I’ve started going to the gym, bars, language exchange meetups, dancing, I’ve started reading which I did not do ever before (one of the books that I’ve read was The Answer, which changed a lot). Ive done social experiments approaching people in public. I also got a bunch of new friends, and eventually an amazing girlfriend, whom with I’ve done monk mode for several weeks. And even though we are not together anymore I owe her big time for showing me a completely different world, a world of self-love, boundary setting, positivity... For me, at the end of the day, it all comes down to being able to work with yourself, and becoming the best version of yourself. 

  
I am still far away from where Id like to be. There is a lot of things I struggle with. Approaching in public, and social situations where I care about the outcome, fearing to be intrusive, to be embarrassed, or to show interest in a girl.

  
The most important lesson I learned: Dont be stuck in your life, write down your dreams, and follow them. The world will not do it for you. No dream is ever a bad or an unworthy one, it is a dream, and in this moment, you should go after it.



Let\`s meet:  
I am now solo-traveling around Europe, first stop - Madrid. And I would love to meet you guys! Talk deep self-improvement topics, exchange experiences, cold-approach, or even just grab a coffee or a drink! DM me if you are interested!

Moving out wasn’t easy. I didn’t have everything planned, I just knew I couldn’t stay where I felt trapped. Now I wake up in my own little apartment it’s small, a bit messy, but it’s mine. I make my own coffee, play my own music, and choose what kind of life I want to build.

1o0qykm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1o0qykm/priest_sharing_private_information/,Priest sharing private information?,"This is outside of confession. 

I shared some private information with our priest, in order to ask for prayers and spiritual counsel. I asked that he not share this information with anyone and he agreed readily. He did tell Matushka, which I guess I can understand, since I'd expect that she's also held to a high degree of integrity. In person, in private, she told me she hadn't told anyone and I asked her to please keep it that way. 

However, I've been approached by parishioners who indicate they know what's going on, and there is literally zero way for anyone else to know without it coming from Fr/Mka, especially given the specific details these people told me they knew. There was also a statement indicating this was discussed as a group within church leadership. As many as a dozen seem to know, and I assume it will spread. This is on the level of, say, a terminal cancer diagnosis, or having a miscarriage, or a financial collapse. Ironically the folks who usually gossip the most seem to not know yet, which only reinforces that this came from a discussion with specific people. 

I feel very exposed and alone. I don't know how to fix this. What if I talk to Fr and he doesn't think it was a big deal? I have attended this parish for three years and it felt like home until now. Since this happened I have not stayed for coffee hour and that really hurts.

1o0qyg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1o0qyg8/explore_tide_laundry_stain_remover_review_is_it/,Explore Tide Laundry Stain Remover Review Is It the Best for Tough Stains?,"Testing out Tide 10814521013381 Laundry Stain Remover has been nothing short of an adventure in itself. As someone who deals with an unfortunate amount of coffee spills and the occasional red wine incident, I knew I needed a product that could tackle stubborn stains on a variety of surfaces. Spoiler alert: while this stain remover impressed me with its robust capabilities, there are some aspects worth a closer look.

**Performance That Packs a Punch**

The Tide Laundry Stain Remover's advanced formula left a significant mark on my cleaning routine (in a good way!). Honestly, I wasn’t expecting it to go head-to-head with persistent red wine spills, but it removed them from both a white shirt and my beige carpet with surprising efficiency. I followed the instructions by spraying directly onto the stain, giving it a 5-minute wait before washing, and voilà! No trace of the incident remained. It blew me away how well it worked on grass stains from my nephew's soccer uniform, making it a top choice for versatile stain removal.

[Grab Tide 10814521013381 at the best price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b09c2kfz22/)  

**Ease of Use for Busy People**

This product is straightforward to use even if you're juggling a hundred tasks. You get two sprayer nozzles and four bottles in the pack, which I found really convenient. The spray mechanism is smooth and doesn’t clog, which is always a huge plus when you’re in a hurry. After a quick spray and a little gentle rubbing, it took mere minutes to work its magic. My work shirts now look as good as new, which is no small feat when you’re as coffee-prone as I am.

**Strengths**

- Works efficiently across multiple surfaces like clothes, carpets, and upholstery.  
- Targets a wide variety of stains, from grease and coffee to grass and dirt.  
- Includes two spray triggers for hassle-free application.  
- Gentle formula that doesn’t ruin your fabrics even with frequent use.  

**A Few Caveats**

Admittedly, the Tide stain remover isn’t without its flaws. Here are a couple of things I noticed that could be improved:  

- It performs better on fresh stains as opposed to older ones, which may require multiple treatments.  
- Despite its stellar performance, stains from oily foods still needed a couple of attempts for a complete clean.  
- The bottles, while sturdy, could use a clearer measurement line for tracking usage.

**Design and Packaging Thoughtfulness**

As for packaging, the included spray triggers are a handy bonus that helps maximize value. The bottles are sturdy but lightweight enough to handle with one hand, which might seem like a small thing but makes all the difference when you’re trying to work quickly. Tide really thought about the user experience here, and it shows.

**Product Contenders**

Comparing this to other stain removers in the market, I’ve tried sprays like Shout Advanced Gel and OxiClean Spot Remover, but neither gave me the versatility this product offers. While Shout performed well on lighter stains, it struggled with heavy-duty grime. OxiClean, on the other hand, was effective but led to some discoloration on my delicate fabrics, which Tide avoided entirely. For households with children, pets, or simply lots of opportunities for spills, the extra reliability Tide provides is worth noting.

**Worth Every Penny**

From a cost perspective, you're getting a well-rounded package that outperforms its price competitors. The fact that you get not just one but four bottles in a pack makes it very economical, especially if you deal with frequent stains like my family does. While price points fluctuate, this product delivers a feature set I’d gladly pay for again.

1o0qxwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBBConsulting/comments/1o0qxwf/is_it_worth_it_for_me_to_transfer_to_northwestern/,Is it worth it for me to transfer to Northwestern for MBB consulting?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a freshman like a month in college. For context in hs I got into multiple T20 schools including many targets for consulting, however ended up chosing my current state school since I got a full-ride scholarship and was told aside from it's lack of prestige all else would be equal.

Aside from the fact that I absolutely hate it socially (big party school, I am a nerd) and it's location (feels suffocating as I've lived in my state/city my entire life but love adventure and exploration), after coffee chatting a lot of different professionals over summer and the first month of school, I realized I really want to do consulting.

My current school has absolutely horrible placements (5 going to MBB would be considered pretty good for a year; our student population is one of the largest in the country), and there is literally no culture around consulting here. There are only two main consulting clubs on campus, and neither of them works with big companies or has good placements.

I was thinking of transferring to Northwestern because I like Chicago, am fairly confident I could get in, and their consulting placements are obviously extremely high. However, my biggest reservation is cost. My family is in a weird financial position where I'm not going to get any aid, but they also can't really afford to pay for me to attend. While they're supportive and willing to support me as much as they can, that support would include draining their life savings and potentially digging into their retirement. My parents are very hard-working and very frugal, so obviously I'd feel horrible asking them to go to that extent even if they say it's okay.

Other context:

1. Through my network I acquired in hs and my current scholarship program, getting a referral at my current school isn't a problem. I already have like five McKinsey Associates-Managers that have offered case prep and official referrals when I apply to internships.
2. I'm pretty sad at my current school. While I have decent friends (most of them from hs) I feel super out of place in all my classes and clubs and really want to explore new places. At the same time though not sure if my happiness is worth 300k...
3. There are absolutely no resources or information surrounding consulting at my school. The clubs genuinely don't know anything, and I have literally been ghosted by career services anytime I have asked questions about consulting or placements. However, with the money I'm making/saving with my scholarships, I'm willing to spend 10-20k on a coach to navigate recruiting/interview prep when the time comes, so I guess this can kind of be mitigated.
4. I'm currently an engineering major. I do not like or care about engineering, however it's the only decent program at my current school so I chose it so if all else fails I will be employed post grad. I'll likely have to transfer as an engineering or some life science major as that's where all my credits will be, but I love chem and physics so I could probably just choose one of those at NU.

In summary, I'd like to know if the school name, network, and school culture of NU would be worth the extra 300k to attend. I know it's early on and transfer applications aren't due until well into next year, but I kind of have to start planning rec letters, finances, and summer plans now with that in consideration.

The bold black script of Aroma conveys sophistication and calm, while the yellow coffee text adds a touch of warmth and energy — representing the cozy, inviting atmosphere every coffee lover seeks.

The main idea behind the design is to blend the feeling of aroma with the peaceful moment that every cup of coffee brings.

Before getting diagnosed and put on medication, it felt like I could never make myself do anything. I felt so lazy. Once I was on meds, it was like I could do everything I couldn't before (remembering things, laundry, keeping a clean space, routines, etc). I realized that I hadn't been lazy all my life, I had just needed to treat my ADHD. As I went off to college though, it's like everything I had in place unraveled. Freshman year I managed to maintain a relatively consistent routine, but every year since I keep getting less disciplined. It's now my senior year. I find myself putting off dishes, cleaning, anything really. I never fold my laundry, just dump it in a basket (and that's assuming I do my laundry at all). I'm late for everything because I find it so hard to get out of bed and stop scrolling. I don't go to bed until at least midnight, but often it ends up being 2 in the morning. I press snooze over and over and over. I've tried the ""54321"" countdown for getting out of bed and my brain is like, ""okay whatever, 5 more minutes."" I'll know I have stuff to do, but I'll put it off. Without any external structure or pressure, I will waste an entire day away and then feel so guilty I could cry. I don't even spend my free time how I'd like. I could be doing SO many things, but I watch tv or scroll. I don't think this is depression because I am happy. I have friends, I'm in clubs, I enjoy things. This medication really worked for me in high school, so I don't think I'm on the wrong meds. If I try and increase the meds now, I end up feeling anxious and having bad side effects. The only instance that I feel I'm really productive is when I combine pressure (like an exam) and a coffee. I really want to be different. I'm applying to an intense graduate program and I know this lifestyle won't cut it. Now that I'm medicated and an adult, is this truly laziness? How do I start to fix things if I can't seem to make myself do anything?",1,1759870326.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I'm a 24 year old female studying in a foreign country. Last year I entered the university a week later than others, so at this point people had already formed groups (there is also specific nationality groups that hang out only with each other). I tried to make friends, but ultimately I managed to make only one friend, 20 year old female native to this country, who I will refer to as Petty. We would hang out every day and had a good time together, I even let her stay in my apartment a few times. Petty was already friends with 3 other girls but they distanced themselves from her as we got closer. In June classes ended and the exam season started, petty had many more exams than me so she was stressed, I asked her twice if she wants to grab a coffee but she declined. I had a weird feeling about it as I could see her posts on Instagram indicating she isn't that busy, but I still understood her and didn't want to overreact. Then again all year we had talked about how we would go see each other in the coast in August as her families beach house is half an hour away from my boyfriends, and as to also hang out on my birthday in August. THEN AGAIN, she apologized saying the same excuse. This time it really hurt me but I let it slide.   
I failed one big subject (65% of the class did tbh), and Petty failed even more, so we both had to repeat the year. We had a phone call two weeks before the start of classes and she said she would like to see me but that she is busy, I said I would like to also but that it's also okay if not because school is starting soon anyway. AGAIN, she hung out with other friends and posted it. At this point I called her and explained how hurt I felt and how I didn't want to friends with her anymore because I feel like she is avoiding me on purpose and making me think I'm crazy, but that I would like to hear her explanation if she has one. She replied in such a cold tone that she was stressed from moving, BLABLA same sht as before. She asked if I really don't want to be friends with her, I said I still love her as a friend and that it's okay if she was genuinely in a bad situation, she said the same and we even talked for 40 minutes on the phone.   
Today on the first day of classes, she came in the classroom with two other girls, greeting almost everyone with a huge smile, went to sit somewhere else, said a forced hi to me in under a sec and proceeded to laugh with others, as if she was doing it just to hurt me.   
I don't tolerate bullshit, I distance myself IMMEDIATELY from anyone or anything if I feel they don't want me even a bit, but I gave this person many chances in order to be a better version of me. My heart aches as I remember the way I felt at that moment. I just waited to sign my presence on the paper and left the class. I wrote her that I didn't expect this and that I have no clue what happened but regardless this was the meanest thing she could do, then blocked her number and unfriended her from social media.  
I don't believe this person deserved anything from me or any of my time even thinking about her anymore, the reason I'm still hooked on this and can't move on is how sorry I feel for myself. I'm generally insecure but I still think I am beautiful, relatively funny, honest, caring and definitely not deserving of this. I will try to make friends with some new students as to just have someone to talk to and not feel alone while having to sit with this petty Petty in the same class.

Then I started a load of laundry and made 5 phone calls in an hour! Short calls, but still. I even ran my main laundry load as delicates, pulled out the few things that need to be air dried or low heat, ran the dryer while adding an extra spin to the rest of the load. Transferred the rest of the load to the dryer and got my bedding in the washer. 

The real moment of truth will be putting away the laundry and making my bed later, but I feel good about it. Now I have a few hours to cross stitch a present for my girlfriend in front of the TV. I am on FIRE 🔥!

Please God, I want to impregnate Makima so bad. I want her to bear my children with those beautiful child-bearing hips. That beautiful, radiant angel. Like a goddess, having come down to Earth to cleanse us of our sins.

Makima is beyond divine. I can’t help but drop to my knees in worship whenever I see her beautiful figure even though it's behind that unnecessary gym clothes. I yearn for her in a way both primal and spiritual. I would commit more war crimes than every president in United States history just to lick the sweet, glistening sweat from her smooth, creamy skin. I want to listen to her moans as my manhood throbs within her, I want to hear her heart race as our bodies become one and our souls irreversibly intertwine in the holy sin of carnal union.

I want to suckle at her motherly bosom, slurping that rich juche milk from her teat as she gently strokes my raging erection. I would stir her velvety cream into my coffee and let my balls boil in it. Her cries of pleasure and the rocking of our bed would be louder than the cacophony of ten thousand drone strikes. I would make love to her until my body gave out, and then some. I would let her break my rib cage with any part of her body. I would let her hit me with her car just to be near her for a brief moment.

She’s so perfect it hurts. Every moment without her I suffer a pain worse than breaking every bone in my body simultaneously while drowning and also having shards of glass coated in hot sauce forced through every orifice of my body. I want her, I need her. I want to desecrate her crisp general suit. I want to start a family with her and retire after our twenty seven children have grown up and moved out. I want to see those luscious lips speak such filthy, perverse words into my ear while she slides ice cubes down my gaping pisshole.

I want to fuck her like she owes me money. I would let her step on me, just to feel the soft, firm warmth of her feet upon my face and groin area. I would sleep under her just to catch her drool in my mouth. I would fish the strands of hair from her shower drain just to smell her alluring scent, and braid them into necklaces to keep her with me always. Or cock rings. Whichever would please her more.

God please, I would do anything for her. I would relinquish my life, all my hopes and dreams, just to become the socks on her feet so that I may warm her mouthwatering toes with my very being, so that she may feel the heat of my love always. I would encase myself in cement and become her doorstep, so that she may wipe her heels upon my face. I would tear my own limbs off. I don’t know what I’d do after that, or why she might want my limbs. But I would do it.

My queen, my goddess, the light of my life. Please God, let me have her. I want her to be mine and only mine. I would lick the Doritos dust from her fingers and fill her belly button with honey mustard to dip my tendies in. I would give her a sponge-bath with my tongue every morning and serve her breakfast in bed. I would let her eat her eggs and pancakes off my body if it pleased her, no matter how painful the third-degree burns would be.

I would bear the torment of eternal damnation until the end of time to taste the seat of her car but once. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for her, nothing I wouldn’t say. I would beat my own friend to death with my engorged penis if it would bring a smile to Makima's shining face. I wouldn’t even let myself cum until she gave me permission.

I love you, Makima. Please. Be mine. Be my wife, my lover, my mommy, my everything. Say yes. Answer my calls, respond to my letters. Something. Give me a sign.

1o0qq69,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o0qq69/there_are_bugs_everywhere_part_two/,There are bugs everywhere. part two,"Now, I wouldn't say I'm afraid of bugs. They just gross me out and I avoid trying to have to deal with them.  I leave them alone if they leave me alone. I'm not the type of person to start screaming when I see one, or run across the country to avoid a spider, but place one in my hand I'll definitely drop it in disgust. If one is crawling on me I'll slap it off. 

So obviously I'm not a fan of them like my older sister is. She's the type to save them. She sees a spider in her home she'll take it outside, sees one on the sidewalk she'll take it to the grass to avoid it from getting stepped on. If she sees a bug with a cool pattern on it, or one she doesn't see often, she'll take a photo of it.  Which is all to say that she's weird and I have forbidden her from sending me that crap, yet she still sends it to me. 

This is why I asked her to come over and help me with this infestation of silverfish. I told my landlord about it on Monday, and he told me he'd look into it to see what he can do about it.  That was last week, and he still hasn't done anything to help me. He hasn't picked up any of my calls nor responded to any of my emails. So plan b, get my sister to help me. 

She came over Saturday, on her day off. She seemed tired and already annoyed with me. I was waiting in the living room anxious to get this problem done and over with. My leg was bouncing up and down as I sat on the edge of the couch. I heard the buzzer signaling that she was at the front of the apartment building so I buzzed her in and got up to start waiting by the door for her. When I heard the first knock on my door I opened it. 

She was standing there tired from a week of late night shifts with a grocery bag in her hand, probably leftover food from our mom. I stepped aside letting her in. I closed the door behind her, following her to the kitchen nearby. I watched her from my kitchen island, the one that separated the kitchen from the living room. She started to put away the leftovers and extra groceries. I waited for her to say something to me and when she didn't I decided to start 

“Cassie, please,..” 

“I know Jess, just give me a second,” she interrupted. I watched her finish putting those groceries away and she finally looked at me “now tell me, where are you seeing those bugs again?”

I got up, maybe a little too fast, and led her to my room. You see I kept seeing more and more of them throughout the week. Moving around like I wasn't here. It kept getting harder to ignore them. I opened the door to my room and stepped inside. I stopped at my bedside table looking towards the office area of the room. “They're mostly over here.”  I gestured towards the whole area. ‘Mostly’ implies that I see them elsewhere, but I don't.  I see them in my office only. They never go past my bedside table. 

My sister came in and looked over the area. I looked to the floor surprised to see nothing. The bugs that were plagueing my room were gone. I looked at my desk and other parts of my room suddenly feeling embarrassed. My office was a mess. The plant I kept near my desk was definitely at the end of its life. Papers, pens, pencils littered about. I had a pile of clothes in the corner, and what I like to call ‘boxes of doom’ underneath my desk. They were boxes of random things, like a junk drawer but underneath my desk and in a box. Obviously you could see the reason as to why I might have attracted these bugs. 

My sister didn't say anything about the state of my office. Instead she handed me bug spray “well, let's start getting rid of your bug problem.” 

We started to move things around to find where the silverfish were hiding. I moved the pile of clothes into my laundry hamper. The boxes off the floor and out of the room, looked underneath my drawer, and nothing, no bugs to be found, just dust and a couple things that rolled underneath my drawer. My sister continued to look around with me but we soon gave up. Putting the boxes back we went to go drink some coffee in the living room, taking a break. 

“I swear they were there, practically taking up the whole space,” I exaggerated. 

She looked at me skeptically, “Maybe they found a hiding spot underneath the floor, or in the cracks of the floor and wall.”

“Maybe, but I saw them this morning, they don't care if I'm around, so why would they all collectively decide to hide?”

“Jess, they're bugs, they didn't decide anything, they're just doing what bugs do.”

I sighed, feeling defeated. I looked up at the ceiling, my head being supported by the couch, and my hands warmed up by the cup of coffee I'm holding. Today was cooler than the others. It probably rained recently. 

My sister broke the silence, “Maybe this is like the spider thing.” 

“The spider thing?” I repeated back glancing at her. 

“Yep, remember when we had bunk beds as kids?”

I sat up, taking a sip of my coffee.  “I guess,... I had the top bunk, right?” 

She nodded, “Yep, and well after a couple years or so you started seeing these spiders in the corners of the ceiling, you refused to go up there, telling Dad to kill them.” 

I didn't remember any of this, I do remember that if I saw a spider I would get my father to kill them, but nothing about these times.

“Usually, I would've told him not to kill them just to take it outside.” 

“Oh yeah, I remember that,” I smiled.  “I didn't really care as long as he got rid of them.” 

“Yep, but,.. um there were no spiders.” 

“What?” I looked at her confused.

“Whenever you brought Dad to kill those spiders you saw, there wasn't actually anything there.” 

I really don't remember any of this.

“I don't get it, why the hell would I do that, then.” 

She shrugged.  “Not sure.  Dad thought it was a kid thing, that you'd grow out of it. I think that you didn't want to have a bunk bed anymore, that you wanted your own room. I'm pretty sure when we got rid of the bunk bed, you stopped seeing those spiders everywhere.  And well, Dad was right in a way, you grew out of it.” 

I paused, taking in this new memory.  “Alright, so how does that relate to this?” 

“You need a change of pace Jess, maybe go outside, hang out with friends, maybe take a vacation from work.”

I rolled my eyes at that.

“Maybe get a pet, give you something to take care of.” 

“I don't know, I'm not big on pets.” 

After that she started to nag me, needlessly worried about me, my sleeping and eating habits. She's always like that whenever she comes over. I got her to change the subject and we had a normal, relaxing time. On the couch taking a much needed break. I think we both need days like that. where it's just the two of us hanging out like old times. 

After she left that afternoon, I didn't see the silverfish until two or three days later. Except they were so much bigger than before, crawling in groups of three or four, together as moving clumps on the floor, as if one being. I know for a fact if I went into my office they wouldn't hesitate to climb onto me. 

The worst part is I started seeing spiders. ",1,1759869944.0,creepcast,0,0.99,False

I am his first girlfriend and basically his first everything if you know what i mean.. I’ve had 2 boyfriends before him but the relationships were shorter than 3 months and we did nothing but kiss.

Now, this boy is one tear younger than me. We are at a music school together. I’m 19, he’s 18. Since he is one year younger than me he is in a different class and in this class there is this girl…let’s call her Emma. Emma is that type of girl that is so naturally pretty, attractive, godly beautiful, literally perfectly built. Blonde, blue eyes, tall and a very very good singer. Nick and Emma know each other since they were 11. They have got through difficult times together, with their family situations that are similar: drunk fathers, beaten mothers and just conflicts. They have always been there for each other. He also had a crush on her from grade 5 to 7. He used to have her contact in his phone by “emma<33” 😐 They got presents for each other for Christmas, i mean not ordinary presents but expensive perfumes and stuff.

I met him in may 2024. We have chatted for a little bit (like 2 weeks), then we fell for each other and  poof-  relationship. I have asked hum about this girl because i had such a strong gut feeling that there is something off about nick and emma, but he told me that there is nothing going on between them so i trusted him. Now they remained friends on social media, she sends him memes on tiktok and he does too. They sit next to each others in class, sometimes go to coffee together (with another classmate too). I started to get pretty mad about this. Don’t get me wrong, he is very affectionate with me and told me that he does not have any feelings for her but i just feel that this is not the truth. For example, something that really pisses me off so bad and i told him about this too is this: whenever she gets huge news she calls him. For example, she went to the preselections to this big national competition for singing. She signed a confidentiality contract  to not tell anyone informations or “spoilers” about the show and guess what she did. She called nick and told him right after she found out and it was also during an important recital for me🫥

After talking with him about this and telling him that i am not ok with all of this bs, and told him straight in the face that im gonna break up with him if i catch him sitting next to her in class again, guess what he did today? - he sat next to her, and his excuse was that the only choice he had was the first bench in class that is basically nearest point to the teacher. He always uses this fvckass excuse ffs.

I went to a different hospital today for a second attempt at ureteroscopy and laser. Sadly the surgeon was just not able to safely get the instruments through my very narrow ureter. To his credit, he did warn me there was a relatively high chance of failure but still worth trying. So the stone is still there and I've  got a new stent (the internal kind, non-string).

ENORMOUS difference in this hospital with aftercare. You can read my linked post above about the barbaric treatment in previous hospital. Imagine telling a post-surgery patient who's shouting in pain to get dressed and to ""call your GP"" for pain relief.

In this hospital today, woke up from surgery, of course the first thing I asked was whether the surgery had succeeded, the recovery nurse very sympathetically told me no. I had pretty bad pain (7ish out of 10) and so she immediately sorted a morphine drip. With the pain controlled I was able to sit up and talk with surgeon. 

Went back to ward and was told absolutely no rush. Their protocol is that you have to stay until you 1. eat something and 2. pee.

I was given a sandwich and coffee and water. Nurse assistant came every 30 min to take blood pressure and ask how I was doing. I felt fine. Really hungry! 

Surgeon, anesthesiologist, and recovery nurse all popped by to see how I was doing.

Went to pee and there was pain and some blood, but nothing worse than what you might feel with a UTI. Poured warm water over myself while peeing, which helped.

Nurse discharged me with pain medication and a pain management plan. 

I literally have no pain at all and am relaxing at home now. Obviously I would have liked to be done today, but I know that when I go back for next treatment I'll be treated decently again so that makes all the difference. ",3,1759869887.0,KidneyStones,0,0.81,False
1o0qoj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenrelationships/comments/1o0qoj9/i_f_18_have_a_problem_with_my_boyfriend_m_17/,I [F 18] have a problem with my boyfriend [M 17],"Me and my boyfriend, Nick, are together for 1 year and 4 months. I am his first girlfriend and basically his first everything if you know what i mean.. I’ve had 2 boyfriends before him but the relationships were shorter than 3 months and we did nothing but kiss.

Now, this boy is one tear younger than me. We are at a music school together. I’m 18, he’s 17. Since he is one year younger than me he is in a different class and in this class there is this girl…let’s call her Emma. Emma is that type of girl that is so naturally pretty, attractive, godly beautiful, literally perfectly built. Blonde, blue eyes, tall and a very very good singer. Nick and Emma know each other since they were 11. They have got through difficult times together, with their family situations that are similar: drunk fathers, beaten mothers and just conflicts. They have always been there for each other. He also had a crush on her from grade 5 to 7. He used to have her contact in his phone by “emma<33” 😐 They got presents for each other for Christmas, i mean not ordinary presents but expensive perfumes and stuff.

I met him in may 2024. We have chatted for a little bit (like 2 weeks), then we fell for each other and  poof-  relationship. I have asked hum about this girl because i had such a strong gut feeling that there is something off about nick and emma, but he told me that there is nothing going on between them so i trusted him. Now they remained friends on social media, she sends him memes on tiktok and he does too. They sit next to each others in class, sometimes go to coffee together (with another classmate too). I started to get pretty mad about this. Don’t get me wrong, he is very affectionate with me and told me that he does not have any feelings for her but i just feel that this is not the truth. For example, something that really pisses me off so bad and i told him about this too is this: whenever she gets huge news she calls him. For example, she went to the preselections to this big national competition for singing. She signed a confidentiality contract  to not tell anyone informations or “spoilers” about the show and guess what she did. She called nick and told him right after she found out and it was also during an important recital for me🫥

After talking with him about this and telling him that i am not ok with all of this bs, and told him straight in the face that im gonna break up with him if i catch him sitting next to her in class again, guess what he did today? - he sat next to her, and his excuse was that the only choice he had was the first bench in class that is basically nearest point to the teacher. He always uses this stupidd excuse. I just feel that my relationship with him has interrupted something personal between them and i seriously need to know if i am delusional or if i should take initiative.",1,1759869839.0,teenrelationships,1,1.0,False

I have been researching different grief support groups in OC and have had a difficult time finding one that is exactly what I'd be interested in. I know other people have posted in this subreddit about grief support groups before, but I am specifically interested in starting a group for women between the ages of 18-30 who have lost a parent, sibling, or other important person and are working through their grief at a young age. Additionally, this group would be peer led, and would be more focused on sharing experiences/offering support through community. More like an informal coffee chat than a GriefShare group. The group would also be non-religious (as in not specifically focused on religion), but if you are religious and would find this group helpful please feel free to reach out.  
  
I am flexible about finding a public meeting place that would work for anyone interested. If you fit the above criteria and have also been having a difficult time finding a group that works for you, please message me with some details about your experience with grief (does not have to be detailed, you can be as brief as you like) as well as your name/city.",13,1759869743.0,orangecounty,3,1.0,False

**Premise 3:** The One Religion's [need-based moral equation and framework](https://theonereligion.org/need-based-morality/) with recursive necessity is the best assessment of how an action fulfills or frustrates needs.

**Premise 4:** Everyone uses the best moral framework they can.

**Conclusion 2:** All people use The One Religion's objective need-based morality.

Friends, all morality really is need-based. And emotions are ""simply"" signals that our need-states have apparently changed.

Ever get that warm glow from helping someone? Or that knot in your stomach when you see something unfair?

That's not just a random feeling. It's a signal from a high-precision moral compass that's automatically tracking all your needs (and often other's needs, too), and you were born with it.

Think about it for a second:

1. Every single thing you consciously do, from grabbing a coffee to calling a friend, is an attempt to meet a **need**. (The need for energy, for connection, for safety, for joy).
2. And what is ""being good,"" really? It's just the simple, beautiful art of choosing the best way to meet those needs for yourself and for the people around you.

When you put those two truths together, the conclusion is breathtaking:

**You are already a moral being, every second of every day.** You don't have to learn a complicated set of ancient rules. You just have to learn to understand and listen to the wisdom your body is already giving you. All emotions are signals that specific need-states have changed. Think about that. They are not always right, but it helps to understand what they actually are signaling.

That gut feeling is data. That pang of empathy is guidance. That spark of joy is confirmation.

This isn't about becoming something you're not. It's about awakening to the profound, compassionate genius you already are.

The One Religion's Need-based morality teaches that **an action is moral or immoral to the degree that it meets or frustrates objective needs to the degree that those needs are objectively necessary**. **The more we need something, the better it is to provide it and the worse it is to take it away.** I bet you already agree with us. One can even start determining how necessary each need is by using our recursive necessity equation.",0,1759869718.0,DebateReligion,28,0.43,False

Maintaining excellent oral hygiene is more than just a routine—it's a critical investment in your overall health and well-being. Your smile is one of the first things people notice, and healthy teeth can boost your confidence, prevent painful dental issues, and contribute to your overall physical health. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the most effective strategies to keep your teeth sparkling clean, prevent decay, and maintain a radiant smile that lasts a lifetime.

Understanding Dental Hygiene Basics

Proper dental care goes far beyond simple brushing. It's a holistic approach that involves multiple techniques and consistent practices. Let's break down the essential components of maintaining impeccable oral health.

Daily Brushing Techniques

Brushing your teeth might seem straightforward, but many people make critical mistakes that compromise their oral hygiene. Here are the **best practices for effective tooth brushing**:

• Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
• Brush at a 45-degree angle to the gums
• Use gentle, circular motions
• Brush for at least two minutes
• Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months

Choosing the Right Toothpaste

Not all toothpastes are created equal. Look for these key ingredients:

1. Fluoride (prevents tooth decay)
2. Calcium carbonate (gentle abrasive)
3. Potassium nitrate (reduces sensitivity)
4. Antimicrobial agents

The Science Behind Dental Plaque

Dental plaque is a sticky biofilm containing millions of bacteria that continuously form on teeth. Understanding its formation can help you develop more effective cleaning strategies. Research shows that plaque can begin forming just 4-12 hours after brushing, which is why consistent oral care is crucial.

Flossing: The Unsung Hero of Oral Hygiene

Many people underestimate the importance of flossing. **Daily flossing removes up to 40% of plaque** that brushing can't reach. Proper flossing technique involves:

• Using about 18 inches of floss
• Gently sliding between teeth
• Curving around each tooth's base
• Using a clean section of floss for each tooth

Mouthwash and Additional Protection

A quality antibacterial mouthwash can provide extra protection against:

• Bacterial growth
• Bad breath
• Plaque buildup
• Gum disease

Diet's Impact on Dental Health

What you eat significantly affects your teeth. Foods and drinks to limit include:

• Sugary snacks
• Acidic beverages
• Sticky candies
• Excessive coffee and tea

Professional Dental Care

Regular dental check-ups are non-negotiable. Dentists recommend:

• Bi-annual professional cleanings
• Annual X-rays
• Early detection of potential issues
• Professional tartar removal

Advanced Oral Hygiene Tips

Consider incorporating these advanced techniques:

• Electric toothbrushes
• Water flossers
• Tongue cleaning
• Probiotics for oral health

Common Mistakes to Avoid

Prevent these typical oral hygiene errors:

• Brushing too hard
• Neglecting your tongue
• Using the wrong toothbrush
• Skipping regular dental visits

Conclusion

Maintaining pristine oral health requires dedication, knowledge, and consistent practice. By implementing these comprehensive strategies, you can protect your teeth, prevent dental problems, and maintain a confident, healthy smile. Remember, your oral health is a window to your overall well-being, so invest the time and effort to keep your teeth clean and strong for years to come.",1,1759869572.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

I've been getting many videos about mooncakes leading up to mid autumn festival season. I've never tried them (I'm planning to!), but I love all the different flavor pairings and beautiful designs I've been seeing.

For the past couple of years, I've done homemade Christmas presents (one year personalized candles, last year cinnamon coffee cakes), and I'm inspired by the moon cakes.

I am not chinese and not Asian-American at all, and would feel strange giving dozens of mooncake gifts to my friends and family. (I'm not looking to be convinced to just make and give them, it would feel like appropriation to me)

Are there any other pastries or baked goods that involve a dough with a sweet, thick filling? Or any other ideas that can be presented very nicely. I wouldn't want to do cupcakes because I don't want to make icing haha, and something easy to transport and keep in a cute box.

  
FYI I am African American, I enjoy baking simple things. I will likely include a variation with a sweet potato flavoring to add my own heritage/culture, but also flavors I like as an individual and want to share.

1o0qeiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CamGirlProblems/comments/1o0qeiz/cam_girl_money_magic/,Cam Girl Money Magic,"Hello lovelies,

  
I practice witchcraft and I'm just sharing the bones of a camming/pso specific money bowl I'm starting to use for any fellow spiritual babes in this forum. I've practiced witchcraft on and off for a decade but I'm starting to do more folk magic and sex magic focused workings that are easy to weave into my daily life. Big ceremonial ritual is too exhausting, it just becomes another task my ADHD avoids or my OCD overthinks. This is as big of a spell as I do nowadays and its like twice a year maybe. You don't have to identify as a witch to do this btw, call it manifestation if it makes you more comfortable, or you can easily make it a prayer bowl situation by dedicating it to a deity of your choice. I'm not some manifesting expert, I just love talking about this stuff and this spell is helping to motivate me to work harder in the real world on my cam sites. I watched a few YT videos from various witch channels (mainly Chaotic Witch Aunt) and tweaked the basics to make it focused on online SW. This is just what I'm experimenting with atm, feel free to comment with your ideas!

\*BTW, I used an altoid tin for my money ""bowl"", because I have cats whose life mission is to bankrupt me at the vet by consuming forbidden items, so an actual bowl wasn't gonna work for me. You can use literally whatever receptacle works for you. I also don't want cat hair all over loose ingredients that are impossible to clean so a closed container was a must for me.\*

A lot of the ingredients I used are from my garden I share with my roommates, so I'm going to list categories/ purposes and then mine and other possible/ more accessible ingredients.

  
1. Pick your container and cleanse it. I used smoke because I love lighting shit on fire but I made sure there was plenty of ventilation since I have cats, do not use smoke cleansing in a closed room with animals. You can also use sound, that's the easiest way imo, I usually use a bell or my favorite song to cleanse tools/ my space.

2. Place some representation of your camming persona inside. I also wrote mine on my petition, so you can always just do that I suppose. My altoid tin has a death moth engraved on the top, which is part of my business logo so that worked for me.

3. Compile your loose ingredients. Due to the tiny space, I batch mixed mine and then put a spoonful in a paper sachet to reduce mess. Below are the main categories and then what I used/ what you could use:

**♡ Money and/or some representation of wealth:** US money is ugly to me, so I used herbs and green candle wax to represent money instead. I used green celosia flower seed (1 flower makes thousands and thousands of seeds) but you could easily use something more common in kitchen spice cabinets such as poppy seeds, sesame seeds, rice, fennel seeds, dill, etc. Or use actual physical cash if that makes more sense to you, that's what most people do I think.

**♡ Financial protection/cleansing of energy coming in:** I used some sea salt to cleanse away self doubt and shitty energy from clients, and then ground cloves to protect me during my work/ protect my money. Cloves are extremely antioxidant rich and genuinely amazing for our health, so that made sense for protection to me, but you could just use salt or garlic or frankincense or whatever feels protective to you.

**♡ Abundance Attraction:** I went ham on ingredients for this category lol. Brown sugar (bonus binding energy/ making money stick to you with the molasses), and then half a dozen flowers from my garden that attract tons of pollinators/ catch the eye when looking at the garden. I used these both for attraction but also to boost my visibility on my cam sites. I also included beans, since that plant will climb anything vigorously, to aid me in climbing the ranks of my cam sites/ being seen by many clients. I think most people don't have a garden but you could just use brown sugar and something bright/ flashy/ eye catching to achieve the same effect. I work heavily with plant ingredients so that's just what I used. 

**♡ Siren Call:** As cam models/ phone sex operators/ content creators, we use our mental and physical voices to make money. I used two herbs that are genuinely good for vocal and lung health for this category but honestly I think you could use whatever for this. I don't think it even has to be a physical ingredient, I think you could write out some sexy ""call"" and speak it over the ingredients, whatever works for you. 

**♡ Lust/ Beauty/ Sex Appeal:** You can get infinitely creative with this category too. I used vanilla, damiana (aphrodisiac) and jasmine for this, but you could literally just put a spritz of your favorite perfume, a paper with your lipstick print, even something energetic like whatever song makes you feel sexy and powerful and magnetic played over the ingredients every so often. I also use sex magic and ""feed"" my bowl with my actual orgasms, so that satisfies this category too imo.

**♡ Short term and Long term Prosperity:** On the outside of the sachet, I placed coffee beans for short term abundance. I plan to feed this tin daily before each cam shift, and coffee speeds along intentions for a very brief period. So that is in there for my actual daily cam goals. I also chose a small piece of branch from a very old and strong tree near my home that has been around for at least a century for long term prosperity. Just choose whatever represents these two categories to you.

**♡ Road/ Path Opener:** Something to open/ clear the path you're on. I used ground cayenne since it is a vascular dilator. If you have a spare key I think that would work great too. Hell, even something like a bobby pin could work since that is a common lock pick. Maybe even a small blade to ""cut through obstacles"" if you're wanting a really assertive path opener. I like cayenne because it genuinely makes my body feel warm/ energized and I struggle with apathy and mental paralysis from my mental health issues. You get the gist, use what feels significant to you, that will be what's most powerful, not what someone else decides means said thing.

4. Write your petition(s). Write your name, birthday, and cam persona. Then write a specific goal as if it is guaranteed/ already exists. Write your signature at the bottom or on the back. Honestly just research writing petitions, there's different ways of doing it and I'm the furthest thing from an expert/ experienced in this arena. The main advice I found across the board is to be specific and phrase your intention as ""I have"" not as ""I want"" if that makes sense. You are projecting your will into the world, it is a command you are following up with hard work, not a wish you hope happens. If your current goal for this petition happened, what does that reality look like? Write that achieved goal down in present tense. I will say reach high but remain realistic. Writing ""I've won the lottery, I own a yacht"" if you're currently struggling to pay rent probably is gonna leave you disappointed/ doubting your abilities lol. I write a ""by this date, this exists"" kind of command to give me a time frame and specific numbers to aim for/ measure. You can place your petition in your money bowl like I did or activate it with fire or whatever you want. I like keeping mine around for physical correspondency.

5. Ancestors/ Spirit/ Deities: I don't worship any gods/ goddesses, but if you do, use an ingredient that represents them or do something to dedicate the money bowl to them. You could also make an offering to them or spirit or maybe your blood ancestors if you're wanting their help with this money bowl. I personally work with the archetypal ancestors of all sex workers as far back as we have existed, which is basically all of human history. The advice I've heard about feeding money bowls when working with forces outside our own will is to ""feed"" them with actual money, which makes sense to me. However, due to limited space and my own beliefs, I make offerings to the ancestors of sex workers by donating to either a sex work charity like the Red Umbrella Fund or by sending money to fellow sex worker. This feels like a powerful way to feed my bowl and the most impactful way I can make an offering to these specific ancestors. I love my community and in the end we only have each other so it feels like contributing to that reciprocity loop both on this plane and beyond the veil.

6. Wake/ feed your bowl: If you're already putting money in your bowl every so often, you're technically feeding it/ keeping it active. I will be doing that every couple weeks but I also use sex magic through ritual orgasm before I clock in to energetically feed my spell and bring its energy into my cam shift. No matter how you do it, this bowl can help keep you focused on your sex work goals. Your will followed by action is powerful. 

  
I know everyone's beliefs differ so customize this outline however you would like, I just love witchcraft and wanted to put my customized spell work for our line of work out there to inspire anyone else wanting to do something similar.

I met someone from a dating app for the first time after matching and chatting with a lot of different people. 90% of my conversations ended fizzling out within a few days for various reasons. They were either vapid, surface level conversations i couldn't get into, or women just asking me for money haha. I finally matched with a really cute girl on hinge that I didnt really get my hopes up for because, honestly, she's out if my league. I expected she was probably talking to multiple people and I probably wasnt at the top of her list but apparently I was wrong.

 We chatted for nearly a month before I finally asked if I could take her out and she agreed. I suggested an activity because I wanted to impress her but she actually asked if we could just get coffee and take a stroll. The date went so well we didnt want it to end and ended up finding a little video arcade and spend a few hours there playing Mario kart and knocking back a couple of libations. She's even more beautiful in real life than in her photos and she has a very odd sense of humor much like myself. She's a bit of an open book and over sharer but that's totally okay because I can be too. 

Anyways, I had a great time but I can have a great time with anyone, so I didn't know if she'd actually want to see me again. I was happy even if she didnt like me romantically because I couldn't have picked a better person to be my first date from a dating app. Luckily the story gets even better because she called me the next day and we talked for a few hours and we're going on a second date soon. I'm a grown man and have been in a really long term relationship and have a pretty healthy and secure attachment style yet I cant help but feel like a lovesick sophomore when I talk to her. She knows I'm totally crushing on her and she doesnt make me play those stupid mind games or pretend I'm less interested in her than I actually am. She actually confided in me that she hasn't even checked her dating apps since we started talking because she likes me back. 

This has been pretty great for me and no matter where this leads I will be content with it.",25,1759869027.0,dating,8,0.96,False

A uniformed officer from the emergency room approached Mike and Tom in the lobby, delivering grim news. The doctor said Jerry died on the operating table, too much blood lost to save him.

“Let’s get out of here,” Mike said. “We’ll meet back at midnight to talk with Celia. It’s make or break. If she can’t help, I’m closing the case as a mugging gone bad.”

Tom nodded, and they left, set to reconvene later. He didn’t want to think about the case anymore. He blamed Ann, the manipulative widow, for Jerry’s death—the only one he truly felt for. But he wasn’t about to let Vic walk free if he could help it, if only to do what’s right.

Tom stopped by Regina Pacis Church. He wasn’t religious, but he felt compelled to light a candle for Jerry’s soul. He prayed for guidance, for God’s will to close the Crowbar Skull Murder case and bring justice.

He turned to find Monsignor Coffey standing behind him.

“Glad to see you praying for a change, not stirring up trouble,” the Monsignor said.

“It’s winding down,” Tom said. “I’ll be gone in a week, out of your hair. It’ll take a miracle to catch the killer now.”

“If you’re seeking a miracle, Tom, this is the place,” Coffey said. “I’ll leave you to pray. Just ask God for help.”

The Monsignor slipped into the sacristy. Tom lit a candle to the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Mother before leaving, figuring if they were banking on a Hail Mary, it couldn’t hurt to have Her on his side.

Tom drove past the beauty parlor on his way to the hotel. Through the window, he saw Ann working on a client’s nails, as if nothing had happened, as if Jerry’s life meant nothing to her.

They were all gone—Jimmy, Carmine, Jerry. She was a praying mantis, devouring the men she’d used. Free now to find her next victim. God help him.

At midnight, Tom walked into Maimonides Hospital and entered Dukes’s office. Mike was already there. “This is your show, Tom,” Mike said. “We’re here to back you up. Hope you know what you’re gonna say.”

“I got nothing planned,” Tom said. “Haven’t thought about it all day. I’m winging it, going on instinct to see what shakes out.”

“Let’s get this started, gentlemen,” Dukes said. “Celia’s shift just began.”

They stepped out of the elevator. Celia was at the front desk, reviewing medication paperwork.

“Nurse Jorgensen, we’d like a word in the conference room,” Dukes said.

“I already told you everything I know,” she said. “I don’t see what more I can add.”

“Celia, it’s important,” Tom said. “We’ve got new information—about Dr. Jorgensen.”

Her eyes widened, the tips of her ears flushing red. Tom saw it—she was holding back something that could crack the case wide open, he could feel it.

They shut the conference room door. Tom took the head of the long table, Celia on his right, Mike on his left. Dukes, a towering Black man, sat beside Celia, his presence more to box her in than offer support. Tom took a deep breath, knowing he had one shot to make it count.

“We have an eyewitness,” he said. “A woman who saw it all. She described the man who bludgeoned Jimmy to death.”

Celia flinched, gripping the armrests, her knuckles whitening.

“He’s about five foot nine, bowlegged,” Tom continued. “Fits your husband to a tee, Celia. He’s got motive and a sordid history we can get people to swear to. You’ll be caught in the middle, on the side of Jimmy’s murderer—the man you say you loved. Or you can give us something to end this quick and stand with the angels.”


“You’re asking me to turn in my husband,” Celia said, weeping.

“We’re asking you to turn in a vicious murderer who crushed your lover’s skull because he knew you were leaving him for Jimmy,” Tom said.

Her sobs deepened, her control slipping.

“Yes, I was going to leave Vic for Jimmy,” she said. “He hounded me that night until I admitted it. He said he’d never let me leave and threatened to kill me first.”

Dukes poured her a glass of water from the corner cooler. She gulped it down before continuing.

“He went to the basement and came up with a crowbar. We knew Jimmy walked his dog before work near Regina Pacis at eleven. He put on his black hoodie and said I’d soon see he wasn’t bluffing. I didn’t know what to do, so I went to work. Jimmy never showed. An hour later, word spread through the hospital that he’d been murdered.”

 “Why didn’t you go to the police, Celia?” Mike asked.

“I was too scared,” she said. “He threatened to kill me before he left. When Jimmy turned up dead, I knew he meant it.”

“You’re in too deep now, Celia,” Tom said. “You can’t take back what you just said in front of three cops. You have to go all the way. Is there anything about his clothes or the murder weapon that can pin this on him?”

Her tears stopped, survival mode kicking in. She needed Vic locked away for good to protect herself. After a moment, she spoke.

“Vic’s father worked construction, proud of his tool collection. Jorgensen is a Danish name, venerating St. Jorgen—George in English. He engraved all his tools with a small ‘StG’ for luck. It wouldn’t mean anything unless you knew the story, but it ties Vic directly to the murder.”

Mike stood and called the 69th Precinct from the conference room. “Send two squad cars to Dr. Victor Jorgensen’s house. Cuff him and bring him in. Secure the basement, especially the tools. Don’t let anyone near them. I’m on my way.”

“You did good, Celia,” Tom said. “That took courage. It was only a matter of time before he killed you to keep you from doing this.”

Mike had Dukes take Celia to the 69th to make a formal statement. He and Tom raced to the Jorgensen house. When they arrived, two officers were loading a handcuffed Vic into a squad car. He glanced at them sheepishly, as if knowing his fate was sealed.

In the basement, every tool—from small screwdrivers to large power drills—bore a small “StG” engraving, a guaranteed indictment for Dr. Jorgensen. Jimmy’s murderer was finally in custody.

Chapter Fourteen

Mike invited Tom to the precinct to witness the booking, but Tom declined politely. It was late, he was exhausted, and he’d had enough of what the press called the Skull Crowbar Murder.

Loneliness hit him like a fist in his hometown. He had no friends or family here. An only child of two only children—no siblings, aunts, uncles, or cousins. Nothing. All he’d had in Brooklyn was Jimmy Grillo, his best friend, his surrogate family. Solving his murder had meant everything.

But Jimmy wasn’t the man Tom thought he was—not family, but a depraved degenerate who bit off more than he could chew and paid with his life.

No, Tom didn’t want to celebrate cracking the case with Mike and Dukes at the precinct. All he craved was sleep and a cab to the airport for a flight back to L.A.

Back in his room, Tom stripped to his boxer shorts and guinea tee, collapsing onto the bed. He sank into a deep sleep almost instantly, dreaming of Brooklyn as it should’ve been with Jimmy.

At a ballgame, bowling, sharing drinks at a bar—laughing, swapping high school tales, dodging Officer Beales.

But in every dream, lurking in a corner just over Jimmy’s shoulder, stood Dr. Vic Jorgensen, Carmine, or Ann, each clutching a gleaming, sharp blade, their soulless faces blank, waiting to strike.

His phone jolted him awake at ten a.m. It was Mike, wired on black coffee and adrenaline, calling from the precinct.

“Tom, it’s Mike. Meet me at 6601 17th Avenue ASAP. It’s not over.”

Tom, still groggy, sat up. 

“Mike, what’s not over? You’re not making sense.”

“We’ll talk there. Gotta go, Tom.”

Sweat beaded on Tom’s forehead. He didn’t know what to think or what had happened. Mike’s cryptic tone felt deliberate. Then it hit him—6601 17th Avenue. Jimmy and Ann’s place. What the hell now?

Tom threw himself into the shower, the icy water jolting him awake. He toweled off and tossed on clothes.

A gray, cloudy day loomed outside, threatening thunderstorms. He fired up his car’s engine and headed up Fourth Avenue toward Bensonhurst and Ann’s place, his gut telling him she was tied to Dr. Jorgensen somehow.

When he pulled up, they were loading a lifeless body, sheet draped over its head, into a van marked City Morgue.
Mike stood out front, waiting for Tom.

“She’s dead, Tom,” Mike said. “Someone drove a stiletto clean through her heart. Whoever did it knew what they were doing. She never had a chance.”

The words hung heavy in the air. “So, it’s come full circle. Karma’s a bitch, as they say,” Tom said, his voice steady, almost detached.

Mike nodded, glancing at the crime scene. “It went down last night while we were at the Jorgensen place. Whoever did it didn’t waste time. My guess? One of Carmine’s crew. He was livid when I leaned on him, and he probably blamed her. Likely ordered the hit before he bit it.”

Tom’s eyes narrowed. “What about Lucy, the dog? Was she in the apartment when it happened?”

“Nah,” Mike replied. “Lucy’s been staying with one of the gals at the beauty parlor. She was Jimmy’s dog. After he died, Ann gave her away.”

Tom let out a dry chuckle. “Typical. That woman had a heart of stone.”

Mike gestured toward the staircase. “Come on, let’s head upstairs and look for clues.”

Tom shook his head, his expression hardening. “I’m done here, Mike. Good luck catching her killer, but her murder? Doesn’t spark my interest.”

Mike sighed, then tried a different tack. “Tom, I got the captain to sign off on reimbursing you for your two weeks here. You’ve been a damn lifesaver on this high-profile case. You’ve still got a couple of days left. Help me out til Friday, and I’ll personally see you off at the airport.”

Tom’s gaze softened, just a fraction. “That’s generous of you, Mike. Alright, let’s go upstairs. But I’m doing this for you, not her.”

Tom crouched by the door, his eyes scanning the frame. No signs of forced entry. The lock was intact, the chain undisturbed.

“She let the killer in,” Tom said, straightening up. “Had to. Took the chain off herself. A commotion this late would’ve woken the neighbors.”

Mike nodded, his gaze drifting to the bloodstained foyer where the body had been. 

“Yeah, makes sense,” Tom continued. She was right here, just inside the door. Whoever it was didn’t linger—walked in, stabbed her, and left. She never saw it coming.”

“Cops tossed the place,” Mike said, nodding toward the disheveled apartment. “Just twenty bucks in her dresser. I think we can rule out robbery.”

Tom’s eyes narrowed. “Who took over for Carmine at the club?”

“Billy Notto,” Mike said, his voice grim. “Did collections for Carmine’s crew. A real sweetheart. No mercy for late payers—likes breaking fingers.”

Tom’s jaw tightened. “We’ll need to talk to him. Problem is, we’ve got nothing solid linking him to Ann. Just guesses.” He paused, then added, “Let’s check with the ladies at the beauty parlor. See if Ann was cozying up to anyone we don’t know about.”

Tom and Mike walked into the beauty parlor and broke the news to Sheila. She sank into a chair, tears welling up.

“Poor soul,” she whispered. “Lousy husband, always making life hard for her. Let her rest in peace.”

“Did she mention anyone new?” Mike asked. “A secret lover, maybe? Someone who might’ve done this?”

Sheila shook her head. “Not to me. And if she didn’t tell me, there wasn’t anyone. We were close.”

Mike turned to the other two beauticians. “What about you? Did Ann ever mention a relationship we should know about?”

Both shook their heads. “We weren’t that tight with her,” one said quietly.

Mike handed Sheila his card. “Call if you hear anything that could help.”

Their next stop was the club. Billy Notto sat alone at a poker table, playing solitaire.

Mike pulled up a chair, leaning in close. “What do you know about Ann Grillo’s murder? A hit Carmine ordered before he died?”

Notto stared, confusion flickering across his face. 

“That the woman you were grilling Carmine about? He never mentioned her to me. That what’s going on across the street?”

Mike’s voice hardened. “Know anyone who blamed her for Carmine’s death? Or maybe someone she was seeing? Tell us, and we might ease up on your business.”

Notto shrugged. “I worked for Carmine, not his diary. He gave orders, I followed. I don’t know this Grillo woman. That’s the truth, like it or not.”

Tom motioned Mike aside. “I believe him. The only two who’d be tied to her murder died with Carmine in here. We’re chasing the wrong lead.”

Mike glared at Notto. “Alright, we’ll buy it for now. But if I find out you’re lying, I’ll burn you and this place to the ground. Understood?”

Notto met his gaze. “One hundred percent.”

They left the club, the door slamming behind them, and paused on the corner to talk.

“I’m gonna shake down some informants,” Mike said. “See if I can dig up a lead.”

“I’ll check a few angles myself,” Tom replied. “Stay in touch. I’ll let you know if I find anything.”

They split up, each chasing different shadows, both knowing the clock was running out.

Chapter Fifteen

Tom stopped at Silver Star Chinese Restaurant for pork fried lo mein. He couldn’t leave Brooklyn without eating there.

He sat at a table, dipping oversized fried noodles into a small plate of duck sauce. The aroma of wok-fried meats and vegetables wafted from the kitchen, making his mouth water, just like it did when he and Jimmy were in high school.

He was piecing together thoughts about Ann’s murder when the waiter delivered his steaming metal plate of lo mein.

Tom had ruled out nearly every obvious suspect. He couldn’t see Mike’s informants turning up anyone to pin the murder on.

Tom finished his meal, loosening his belt a couple of notches. He skipped the ice cream and fortune cookie, not bothering to read it. The only fortune he wanted was, “Your flight to L.A. is now boarding.”

But he’d promised Mike he’d help wrap up this final piece of the Crowbar Skull Murder case. With Mike’s captain covering Tom’s two-week tab—a hefty sum—he owed it a shot.

Tom didn’t bother with the women at the beauty parlor or the hoods in Carmine’s circle; he knew Mike was chasing those leads. Instead, he headed to the Brooklyn Criminal Court. Flashing his PI badge at the records department, he dug through dusty ledgers from twenty-five years back.

After two hours, he found what he was looking for. It confirmed his theory. He closed the book and handed it back to the clerk, taking no notes, making no copies. His speculation satisfied, he now had to decide what to do with it—and how.

Tom met Mike Thursday afternoon at the 69th Precinct, both lawmen swapping what they’d found.

As Tom expected, Mike had spent days strong-arming local mobsters tied to Carmine’s crew. They reacted like Billy Notto—clueless about Jimmy or Ann, no secret lovers with grudges. Mike came up empty.

Tom shared his theory, vaguely mentioning he’d chased leads on Jimmy’s old acquaintances, but they fizzled out.

“You gotta get ready to leave tomorrow,” Mike said. “When’s your flight? I’ll see you off at the airport.”

“Five p.m.,” Tom said. “I hate rushing to the airport. Appreciate the offer, Mike, but it’s not necessary. I’ve got the rental, and you’re busy. We can say goodbye here.”

“Nah, I want to be there,” Mike said. “Someone should see you off. You’re a damn good cop, Tom. Without you, Jorgensen would’ve walked. Plus, I’ve got your reimbursement check—four hundred bucks. You earned every cent.”

“Alright, my friend,” Tom said. “We made a good team. Too bad we couldn’t crack Ann’s case. But I know you’ll figure it out.”

“One of many,” Mike said. “We gave it a shot. See you at the gate tomorrow.”

“I know you will,” Tom said, shaking his hand before heading out.

Tom hurried toward the front door, head down, dodging his childhood nemesis, Sergeant Beales. He nearly made it when a familiar voice cut through.

“Hey, Tommy,” Beales smirked. “You grew up to be a good cop. My kicks in the ass helped with that.”

“Take care, Harry,” Tom said. “I’d like to say it was good seeing you, but—”

“Still a wiseass,” Beales said. “Now get outta here before I give you another kick for old times’ sake.”

Tom grinned, tossing a two-finger salute. He’d tied up almost everything—except one last thing.

Friday morning, Tom strolled to the Tiffany Diner and took his usual spot at the counter. When Sally, the waitress, came over, he ordered “the usual”—Western omelet, home fries, white toast, and coffee. They traded their ritual flirty banter, Tom complimenting her pink lipstick and the scent of her perfume.

She brought his breakfast, peppering him with questions about L.A. Between forkfuls of eggs and home fries, he handed her his card, telling her to call if she ever visited—he’d show her around.
He left a five-dollar tip, and they said their goodbyes. 

Those breakfasts at the Tiffany had kept him grounded through the chaos of his two weeks.
Walking back to the hotel, he mulled the irony: Ann had called him for Jimmy’s funeral, and he never imagined she’d be dead by the time he left.

He wasn’t shocked Mike couldn’t find Ann’s killer. Mike’s focus on Carmine and his crew had blinded him to what was right in front of them.

The morning flew by. At noon, Tom had one place in mind for what would likely be his last meal in Brooklyn.

Tom checked out of the hotel. It wasn’t luxurious, but it had served its purpose, and he wasn’t sorry to leave. He pulled up in front of Marino’s Pizzeria. Stepping out, he glanced at his old corner—66th Street and 17th Avenue—where he and Jimmy had spent countless hours growing up.

Inside, Tony greeted him from behind the counter. “Slice and a grape drink,” Tom ordered. “Had to have my last Brooklyn lunch here, Tony.” Tony poured a grape drink from the fountain and handed it over.

Tom settled into a booth, hands wrapped around the sweating paper cup. The aroma of hot cheese and oregano filled the small pizzeria. Tony slid a fresh slice in front of him, steam rising from the melted cheese.

“Sit for a minute,” Tom said, gesturing to the seat across.
Tony hesitated, then sat, his face unreadable.

“I know how much you loved Jerry,” Tom said quietly.

“Like a brother,” Tony replied, voice taut.

Tom nodded, taking a slow sip of his drink. “I looked into your past. Back in high school, you ran with a crew called The Holy Boppers. Stiletto knives were their weapon of choice.”

Tony didn’t flinch or speak, just stared at the table.

Tom leaned back. “Ann had it coming. She used Jerry. Used all of us. The way she played him… a man can only take so much.”

Silence hung thick, broken only by the pizza oven’s hum.
Tom stood, tossed a few bills on the table despite the free meal. “I liked Jerry too. Take care, Tony.”

Tony met Tom’s eyes at last. No fear, no guilt—just a quiet, grim understanding.

Tom took a bite of his slice, chewed, and walked out. The cool Brooklyn air hit his face.
Sliding behind the wheel of his rental, he almost smiled. 

Some things never made the police file. Some justice was better left unspoken.

A uniformed officer from the emergency room approached Mike and Tom in the lobby, delivering grim news. The doctor said Jerry died on the operating table, too much blood lost to save him.

“Let’s get out of here,” Mike said. “We’ll meet back at midnight to talk with Celia. It’s make or break. If she can’t help, I’m closing the case as a mugging gone bad.”

Tom nodded, and they left, set to reconvene later. He didn’t want to think about the case anymore. He blamed Ann, the manipulative widow, for Jerry’s death—the only one he truly felt for. But he wasn’t about to let Vic walk free if he could help it, if only to do what’s right.

Tom stopped by Regina Pacis Church. He wasn’t religious, but he felt compelled to light a candle for Jerry’s soul. He prayed for guidance, for God’s will to close the Crowbar Skull Murder case and bring justice.

He turned to find Monsignor Coffey standing behind him.

“Glad to see you praying for a change, not stirring up trouble,” the Monsignor said.

“It’s winding down,” Tom said. “I’ll be gone in a week, out of your hair. It’ll take a miracle to catch the killer now.”

“If you’re seeking a miracle, Tom, this is the place,” Coffey said. “I’ll leave you to pray. Just ask God for help.”

The Monsignor slipped into the sacristy. Tom lit a candle to the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Mother before leaving, figuring if they were banking on a Hail Mary, it couldn’t hurt to have Her on his side.

Tom drove past the beauty parlor on his way to the hotel. Through the window, he saw Ann working on a client’s nails, as if nothing had happened, as if Jerry’s life meant nothing to her.

They were all gone—Jimmy, Carmine, Jerry. She was a praying mantis, devouring the men she’d used. Free now to find her next victim. God help him.

At midnight, Tom walked into Maimonides Hospital and entered Dukes’s office. Mike was already there. “This is your show, Tom,” Mike said. “We’re here to back you up. Hope you know what you’re gonna say.”

“I got nothing planned,” Tom said. “Haven’t thought about it all day. I’m winging it, going on instinct to see what shakes out.”

“Let’s get this started, gentlemen,” Dukes said. “Celia’s shift just began.”

They stepped out of the elevator. Celia was at the front desk, reviewing medication paperwork.

“Nurse Jorgensen, we’d like a word in the conference room,” Dukes said.

“I already told you everything I know,” she said. “I don’t see what more I can add.”

“Celia, it’s important,” Tom said. “We’ve got new information—about Dr. Jorgensen.”

Her eyes widened, the tips of her ears flushing red. Tom saw it—she was holding back something that could crack the case wide open, he could feel it.

They shut the conference room door. Tom took the head of the long table, Celia on his right, Mike on his left. Dukes, a towering Black man, sat beside Celia, his presence more to box her in than offer support. Tom took a deep breath, knowing he had one shot to make it count.

“We have an eyewitness,” he said. “A woman who saw it all. She described the man who bludgeoned Jimmy to death.”

Celia flinched, gripping the armrests, her knuckles whitening.

“He’s about five foot nine, bowlegged,” Tom continued. “Fits your husband to a tee, Celia. He’s got motive and a sordid history we can get people to swear to. You’ll be caught in the middle, on the side of Jimmy’s murderer—the man you say you loved. Or you can give us something to end this quick and stand with the angels.”


“You’re asking me to turn in my husband,” Celia said, weeping.

“We’re asking you to turn in a vicious murderer who crushed your lover’s skull because he knew you were leaving him for Jimmy,” Tom said.

Her sobs deepened, her control slipping.

“Yes, I was going to leave Vic for Jimmy,” she said. “He hounded me that night until I admitted it. He said he’d never let me leave and threatened to kill me first.”

Dukes poured her a glass of water from the corner cooler. She gulped it down before continuing.

“He went to the basement and came up with a crowbar. We knew Jimmy walked his dog before work near Regina Pacis at eleven. He put on his black hoodie and said I’d soon see he wasn’t bluffing. I didn’t know what to do, so I went to work. Jimmy never showed. An hour later, word spread through the hospital that he’d been murdered.”

 “Why didn’t you go to the police, Celia?” Mike asked.

“I was too scared,” she said. “He threatened to kill me before he left. When Jimmy turned up dead, I knew he meant it.”

“You’re in too deep now, Celia,” Tom said. “You can’t take back what you just said in front of three cops. You have to go all the way. Is there anything about his clothes or the murder weapon that can pin this on him?”

Her tears stopped, survival mode kicking in. She needed Vic locked away for good to protect herself. After a moment, she spoke.

“Vic’s father worked construction, proud of his tool collection. Jorgensen is a Danish name, venerating St. Jorgen—George in English. He engraved all his tools with a small ‘StG’ for luck. It wouldn’t mean anything unless you knew the story, but it ties Vic directly to the murder.”

Mike stood and called the 69th Precinct from the conference room. “Send two squad cars to Dr. Victor Jorgensen’s house. Cuff him and bring him in. Secure the basement, especially the tools. Don’t let anyone near them. I’m on my way.”

“You did good, Celia,” Tom said. “That took courage. It was only a matter of time before he killed you to keep you from doing this.”

Mike had Dukes take Celia to the 69th to make a formal statement. He and Tom raced to the Jorgensen house. When they arrived, two officers were loading a handcuffed Vic into a squad car. He glanced at them sheepishly, as if knowing his fate was sealed.

In the basement, every tool—from small screwdrivers to large power drills—bore a small “StG” engraving, a guaranteed indictment for Dr. Jorgensen. Jimmy’s murderer was finally in custody.

Chapter Fourteen

Mike invited Tom to the precinct to witness the booking, but Tom declined politely. It was late, he was exhausted, and he’d had enough of what the press called the Skull Crowbar Murder.

Loneliness hit him like a fist in his hometown. He had no friends or family here. An only child of two only children—no siblings, aunts, uncles, or cousins. Nothing. All he’d had in Brooklyn was Jimmy Grillo, his best friend, his surrogate family. Solving his murder had meant everything.

But Jimmy wasn’t the man Tom thought he was—not family, but a depraved degenerate who bit off more than he could chew and paid with his life.

No, Tom didn’t want to celebrate cracking the case with Mike and Dukes at the precinct. All he craved was sleep and a cab to the airport for a flight back to L.A.

Back in his room, Tom stripped to his boxer shorts and guinea tee, collapsing onto the bed. He sank into a deep sleep almost instantly, dreaming of Brooklyn as it should’ve been with Jimmy.

At a ballgame, bowling, sharing drinks at a bar—laughing, swapping high school tales, dodging Officer Beales.

But in every dream, lurking in a corner just over Jimmy’s shoulder, stood Dr. Vic Jorgensen, Carmine, or Ann, each clutching a gleaming, sharp blade, their soulless faces blank, waiting to strike.

His phone jolted him awake at ten a.m. It was Mike, wired on black coffee and adrenaline, calling from the precinct.

“Tom, it’s Mike. Meet me at 6601 17th Avenue ASAP. It’s not over.”

Tom, still groggy, sat up. 

“Mike, what’s not over? You’re not making sense.”

“We’ll talk there. Gotta go, Tom.”

Sweat beaded on Tom’s forehead. He didn’t know what to think or what had happened. Mike’s cryptic tone felt deliberate. Then it hit him—6601 17th Avenue. Jimmy and Ann’s place. What the hell now?

Tom threw himself into the shower, the icy water jolting him awake. He toweled off and tossed on clothes.

A gray, cloudy day loomed outside, threatening thunderstorms. He fired up his car’s engine and headed up Fourth Avenue toward Bensonhurst and Ann’s place, his gut telling him she was tied to Dr. Jorgensen somehow.

When he pulled up, they were loading a lifeless body, sheet draped over its head, into a van marked City Morgue.
Mike stood out front, waiting for Tom.

“She’s dead, Tom,” Mike said. “Someone drove a stiletto clean through her heart. Whoever did it knew what they were doing. She never had a chance.”

The words hung heavy in the air. “So, it’s come full circle. Karma’s a bitch, as they say,” Tom said, his voice steady, almost detached.

Mike nodded, glancing at the crime scene. “It went down last night while we were at the Jorgensen place. Whoever did it didn’t waste time. My guess? One of Carmine’s crew. He was livid when I leaned on him, and he probably blamed her. Likely ordered the hit before he bit it.”

Tom’s eyes narrowed. “What about Lucy, the dog? Was she in the apartment when it happened?”

“Nah,” Mike replied. “Lucy’s been staying with one of the gals at the beauty parlor. She was Jimmy’s dog. After he died, Ann gave her away.”

Tom let out a dry chuckle. “Typical. That woman had a heart of stone.”

Mike gestured toward the staircase. “Come on, let’s head upstairs and look for clues.”

Tom shook his head, his expression hardening. “I’m done here, Mike. Good luck catching her killer, but her murder? Doesn’t spark my interest.”

Mike sighed, then tried a different tack. “Tom, I got the captain to sign off on reimbursing you for your two weeks here. You’ve been a damn lifesaver on this high-profile case. You’ve still got a couple of days left. Help me out til Friday, and I’ll personally see you off at the airport.”

Tom’s gaze softened, just a fraction. “That’s generous of you, Mike. Alright, let’s go upstairs. But I’m doing this for you, not her.”

Tom crouched by the door, his eyes scanning the frame. No signs of forced entry. The lock was intact, the chain undisturbed.

“She let the killer in,” Tom said, straightening up. “Had to. Took the chain off herself. A commotion this late would’ve woken the neighbors.”

Mike nodded, his gaze drifting to the bloodstained foyer where the body had been. 

“Yeah, makes sense,” Tom continued. She was right here, just inside the door. Whoever it was didn’t linger—walked in, stabbed her, and left. She never saw it coming.”

“Cops tossed the place,” Mike said, nodding toward the disheveled apartment. “Just twenty bucks in her dresser. I think we can rule out robbery.”

Tom’s eyes narrowed. “Who took over for Carmine at the club?”

“Billy Notto,” Mike said, his voice grim. “Did collections for Carmine’s crew. A real sweetheart. No mercy for late payers—likes breaking fingers.”

Tom’s jaw tightened. “We’ll need to talk to him. Problem is, we’ve got nothing solid linking him to Ann. Just guesses.” He paused, then added, “Let’s check with the ladies at the beauty parlor. See if Ann was cozying up to anyone we don’t know about.”

Tom and Mike walked into the beauty parlor and broke the news to Sheila. She sank into a chair, tears welling up.

“Poor soul,” she whispered. “Lousy husband, always making life hard for her. Let her rest in peace.”

“Did she mention anyone new?” Mike asked. “A secret lover, maybe? Someone who might’ve done this?”

Sheila shook her head. “Not to me. And if she didn’t tell me, there wasn’t anyone. We were close.”

Mike turned to the other two beauticians. “What about you? Did Ann ever mention a relationship we should know about?”

Both shook their heads. “We weren’t that tight with her,” one said quietly.

Mike handed Sheila his card. “Call if you hear anything that could help.”

Their next stop was the club. Billy Notto sat alone at a poker table, playing solitaire.

Mike pulled up a chair, leaning in close. “What do you know about Ann Grillo’s murder? A hit Carmine ordered before he died?”

Notto stared, confusion flickering across his face. 

“That the woman you were grilling Carmine about? He never mentioned her to me. That what’s going on across the street?”

Mike’s voice hardened. “Know anyone who blamed her for Carmine’s death? Or maybe someone she was seeing? Tell us, and we might ease up on your business.”

Notto shrugged. “I worked for Carmine, not his diary. He gave orders, I followed. I don’t know this Grillo woman. That’s the truth, like it or not.”

Tom motioned Mike aside. “I believe him. The only two who’d be tied to her murder died with Carmine in here. We’re chasing the wrong lead.”

Mike glared at Notto. “Alright, we’ll buy it for now. But if I find out you’re lying, I’ll burn you and this place to the ground. Understood?”

Notto met his gaze. “One hundred percent.”

They left the club, the door slamming behind them, and paused on the corner to talk.

“I’m gonna shake down some informants,” Mike said. “See if I can dig up a lead.”

“I’ll check a few angles myself,” Tom replied. “Stay in touch. I’ll let you know if I find anything.”

They split up, each chasing different shadows, both knowing the clock was running out.

Chapter Fifteen

Tom stopped at Silver Star Chinese Restaurant for pork fried lo mein. He couldn’t leave Brooklyn without eating there.

He sat at a table, dipping oversized fried noodles into a small plate of duck sauce. The aroma of wok-fried meats and vegetables wafted from the kitchen, making his mouth water, just like it did when he and Jimmy were in high school.

He was piecing together thoughts about Ann’s murder when the waiter delivered his steaming metal plate of lo mein.

Tom had ruled out nearly every obvious suspect. He couldn’t see Mike’s informants turning up anyone to pin the murder on.

Tom finished his meal, loosening his belt a couple of notches. He skipped the ice cream and fortune cookie, not bothering to read it. The only fortune he wanted was, “Your flight to L.A. is now boarding.”

But he’d promised Mike he’d help wrap up this final piece of the Crowbar Skull Murder case. With Mike’s captain covering Tom’s two-week tab—a hefty sum—he owed it a shot.

Tom didn’t bother with the women at the beauty parlor or the hoods in Carmine’s circle; he knew Mike was chasing those leads. Instead, he headed to the Brooklyn Criminal Court. Flashing his PI badge at the records department, he dug through dusty ledgers from twenty-five years back.

After two hours, he found what he was looking for. It confirmed his theory. He closed the book and handed it back to the clerk, taking no notes, making no copies. His speculation satisfied, he now had to decide what to do with it—and how.

Tom met Mike Thursday afternoon at the 69th Precinct, both lawmen swapping what they’d found.

As Tom expected, Mike had spent days strong-arming local mobsters tied to Carmine’s crew. They reacted like Billy Notto—clueless about Jimmy or Ann, no secret lovers with grudges. Mike came up empty.

Tom shared his theory, vaguely mentioning he’d chased leads on Jimmy’s old acquaintances, but they fizzled out.

“You gotta get ready to leave tomorrow,” Mike said. “When’s your flight? I’ll see you off at the airport.”

“Five p.m.,” Tom said. “I hate rushing to the airport. Appreciate the offer, Mike, but it’s not necessary. I’ve got the rental, and you’re busy. We can say goodbye here.”

“Nah, I want to be there,” Mike said. “Someone should see you off. You’re a damn good cop, Tom. Without you, Jorgensen would’ve walked. Plus, I’ve got your reimbursement check—four hundred bucks. You earned every cent.”

“Alright, my friend,” Tom said. “We made a good team. Too bad we couldn’t crack Ann’s case. But I know you’ll figure it out.”

“One of many,” Mike said. “We gave it a shot. See you at the gate tomorrow.”

“I know you will,” Tom said, shaking his hand before heading out.

Tom hurried toward the front door, head down, dodging his childhood nemesis, Sergeant Beales. He nearly made it when a familiar voice cut through.

“Hey, Tommy,” Beales smirked. “You grew up to be a good cop. My kicks in the ass helped with that.”

“Take care, Harry,” Tom said. “I’d like to say it was good seeing you, but—”

“Still a wiseass,” Beales said. “Now get outta here before I give you another kick for old times’ sake.”

Tom grinned, tossing a two-finger salute. He’d tied up almost everything—except one last thing.

Friday morning, Tom strolled to the Tiffany Diner and took his usual spot at the counter. When Sally, the waitress, came over, he ordered “the usual”—Western omelet, home fries, white toast, and coffee. They traded their ritual flirty banter, Tom complimenting her pink lipstick and the scent of her perfume.

She brought his breakfast, peppering him with questions about L.A. Between forkfuls of eggs and home fries, he handed her his card, telling her to call if she ever visited—he’d show her around.
He left a five-dollar tip, and they said their goodbyes. 

Those breakfasts at the Tiffany had kept him grounded through the chaos of his two weeks.
Walking back to the hotel, he mulled the irony: Ann had called him for Jimmy’s funeral, and he never imagined she’d be dead by the time he left.

He wasn’t shocked Mike couldn’t find Ann’s killer. Mike’s focus on Carmine and his crew had blinded him to what was right in front of them.

The morning flew by. At noon, Tom had one place in mind for what would likely be his last meal in Brooklyn.

Tom checked out of the hotel. It wasn’t luxurious, but it had served its purpose, and he wasn’t sorry to leave. He pulled up in front of Marino’s Pizzeria. Stepping out, he glanced at his old corner—66th Street and 17th Avenue—where he and Jimmy had spent countless hours growing up.

Inside, Tony greeted him from behind the counter. “Slice and a grape drink,” Tom ordered. “Had to have my last Brooklyn lunch here, Tony.” Tony poured a grape drink from the fountain and handed it over.

Tom settled into a booth, hands wrapped around the sweating paper cup. The aroma of hot cheese and oregano filled the small pizzeria. Tony slid a fresh slice in front of him, steam rising from the melted cheese.

“Sit for a minute,” Tom said, gesturing to the seat across.
Tony hesitated, then sat, his face unreadable.

“I know how much you loved Jerry,” Tom said quietly.

“Like a brother,” Tony replied, voice taut.

Tom nodded, taking a slow sip of his drink. “I looked into your past. Back in high school, you ran with a crew called The Holy Boppers. Stiletto knives were their weapon of choice.”

Tony didn’t flinch or speak, just stared at the table.

Tom leaned back. “Ann had it coming. She used Jerry. Used all of us. The way she played him… a man can only take so much.”

Silence hung thick, broken only by the pizza oven’s hum.
Tom stood, tossed a few bills on the table despite the free meal. “I liked Jerry too. Take care, Tony.”

Tony met Tom’s eyes at last. No fear, no guilt—just a quiet, grim understanding.

Tom took a bite of his slice, chewed, and walked out. The cool Brooklyn air hit his face.
Sliding behind the wheel of his rental, he almost smiled. 

Some things never made the police file. Some justice was better left unspoken.

It was late, around 8 PM, and the office was quiet except for the hum of the servers and the frantic clicking of my keyboard. I was tasked with cleaning up a test database, a routine, mind-numbing job. Fueled by stale coffee and a desperate desire to impress my boss, I had two terminal windows open side-by-side: one connected to the safe, sandboxed development environment, and the other… the live, beating heart of the company’s production server.

You know where this is going, don't you? My brain was on autopilot, muscle memory taking over as I navigated directories. I typed out the fatal command: `rm -rf *`. A simple, elegant, and utterly catastrophic string of characters designed to wipe everything in the current directory. I took a final sip of coffee, feeling satisfied with a job well done, and hit Enter. Except, my cursor wasn't in the development window. It was in the production one.

For a split second, nothing happened. Then, the confirmation messages began to scroll past my screen at a terrifying speed, a waterfall of data being permanently erased. A cold dread washed over me, so intense it felt like my stomach had been replaced with ice. My heart was hammering against my ribs. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, completely useless. I felt like I was watching a car crash in slow motion, except I was the one who had cut the brakes.

I did the only thing I could think of: I made the walk of shame over to my senior developer’s desk. He was a quiet, perpetually tired-looking guy named Dave. I mumbled something like, “Dave… I think I just deleted everything.” He slowly turned, looked at my screen, and just sighed this incredibly deep, world-weary sigh. After a moment that felt like an eternity, he cracked a tiny smile and said, “Relax, kid. Backups ran ten minutes ago. Everyone does this once. The important thing is you’ll never, ever do it again.” He was right. I’ve never triple-checked a command line so carefully in my entire life.

The war waited in the shadows, restless and hungry.
But for once, the Blacks decided not to listen.

After the chaos of the Ministry, after shattered prophecies and close calls, Sirius woke one morning, slammed the kitchen table, and declared,

“We’re taking a holiday.”

Eight heads turned at once.

“A what?” Harry asked.
“A holiday,” Sirius repeated. “Sun, sea, food, and absolutely no Death Eaters.”
Isabel raised an eyebrow. “You mean voluntarily gathering teenagers near open water?”
He grinned. “Exactly. What could go wrong?”

⸻

☀️ The Potter Villa

The Potter villa sat high above a turquoise Mediterranean cove — a white-stone house wrapped in ivy and salt air.
When the gates opened, the scent of lemon trees hit them, soft and golden.

Elara gasped. “It’s paradise.”
“Temporarily rented paradise,” Isabel corrected, adjusting her sunhat.
Lyra ignored her entirely and dove into the sea. “COLD!” she screamed.
Elara rolled her eyes. “You did that to yourself!”
Adrián Vogel laughed from the dock. “I’d rescue you, but this is excellent entertainment.”

Neville explored the garden, whispering to herbs that hummed faintly in the heat.
Luna wandered after him, barefoot, hair glowing silver under the sun.
“They’re singing,” she murmured.
Neville smiled shyly. “You hear it too?”
“Always.”

On the dock, Ginny kicked off her sandals beside Harry.
“So this was your parents’ villa?” she asked.
“Yeah,” he said softly. “Mum loved the sea.”
“Good taste runs in the family,” she said, brushing his hand.

⸻

🍳 Chaos à la Fairfax-Black

Inside, Sirius announced his culinary plans with suspicious enthusiasm.
“We’ll make breakfast the old-fashioned way!”
“Without magic?” asked Remus, horrified.
“Without rules,” Sirius said confidently.

Ten minutes later, the villa was filled with smoke.
Isabel appeared in the doorway, wand on her hip. “Explain.”
Sirius pointed proudly to a burning omelet. “Experimental cuisine!”
“Charred chaos,” she corrected, extinguishing it with one flick.

From the terrace, Lyra whispered, “Are they always like this?”
Elara grinned. “This is their calm phase.”

Tonks waddled in, her belly round beneath a bright sundress. “You two are worse than my mum arguing about curtains.”
Sirius looked offended. “We’re innovators.”
Remus smirked. “Of destruction, maybe.”
Tonks laughed. “My son’s going to grow up thinking this is normal.”
Isabel kissed her cheek. “If chaos means safety, then yes — let him.”

⸻

🎣 Beachside Lessons

Adrián decided the boys needed a Muggle fishing lesson.
Harry caught his own shoe.
Ron got tangled in his line.
Neville fell in.

“Brilliant teamwork, lads,” Adrián said, valiantly keeping a straight face.
“Ten points to Gryffindor for enthusiasm,” Elara called from the dock.
Lyra conjured a glowing banner: SEAFOOD: 0. CHAOS: 10.

Meanwhile, Isabel and Gisela Vogel shared coffee beneath a sun umbrella.
“I used to think raising children was the hardest part,” Gisela said, smiling faintly.
“It’s keeping them alive once they think they’re adults,” Isabel replied.
Both laughed, watching Sirius try to revive a half-drowned Ron with entirely unnecessary dramatics.

⸻

🍷 Dinner and Fireflies

That evening, the villa glowed.
Candles floated in enchanted bubbles, plates of grilled seafood filled the table, and soft music drifted from Georg Vogel’s wand — a lilting violin melody that belonged to another century.

He raised his glass, eyes twinkling.
“Ah, look at us — a band of dangerous revolutionaries pretending to be civilized.”

Tonks snorted. “Dangerous? We’ve been fighting mosquitoes, not Death Eaters.”
Remus chuckled. “You’ve declared war on them twice.”
“I’m losing,” she said, scratching her arm.

Sirius leaned back in his chair, tanned and smug. “At least mosquitoes aren’t pureblood supremacists.”
Isabel smirked. “They’d probably still follow Lucius if they were.”

Georg chuckled — that dry, elegant kind of humor that could only belong to him.
“Lucius Malfoy,” he said. “Ah, yes. The man with the posture of a prince and the soul of a tax form.”
Sirius nearly spat out his drink.
“You met him?” Isabel asked.
Georg nodded. “Once. He spent twenty minutes describing his hair care routine. I thought he was joking.”
Gisela smiled. “He wasn’t. Georg almost told him he looked like a statue of Narcissus.”
Isabel burst out laughing. “You didn’t.”
“I did,” Georg said with pride. “Politely. I have the gift of insult wrapped in diplomacy.”

Even Dobby, serving dessert in a tiny linen tunic, giggled.
“Master Malfoy’s hair is cursed, sir,” he said seriously.
Everyone roared with laughter.

⸻

🌅 Stories and Secrets

As the sun sank, the conversation softened.
Harry told stories of his parents — James’s mischief, Lily’s kindness, their laughter echoing through the old walls.
Remus listened with a small, tired smile. “They’d be proud of what you’ve made of this place, Harry.”
Sirius raised his glass. “To the ones who built this — and to the ones who keep it alive.”
“Cheers,” Isabel said softly.

Lyra enchanted fireflies to spell Peace Looks Good on You above their heads.
Luna sighed dreamily. “It does.”

Ginny and Harry slipped away toward the shore.
“You think this’ll last?” she asked.
Harry smiled, brushing her hair back. “Even if it doesn’t, we’ll remember it did once.”

⸻

🌌 Moonlight and Mischief

Later, inside the villa, laughter spilled from the adults’ table.
Tonks dozed against Remus’s shoulder, murmuring about baby names.
Gisela hummed softly while Georg swirled his wine, the picture of peace.

Isabel and Sirius danced barefoot across the tile floor.
“You burn breakfast, but you waltz perfectly,” she teased.
“I’m a man of contrasts,” he said.
“You’re a man of chaos.”
“Your chaos,” he murmured, and kissed her temple.

From the corner, Georg observed, amused. “Ah, young love. Passion, foolishness, and no concept of rhythm.”
Remus chuckled. “You do know Sirius can hear you, right?”
“I hope he can,” Georg said, sipping his wine. “A duel at dawn would liven up breakfast.”

⸻

🌙 Peace Before the Fire

By midnight, the villa was silent except for the waves.
Remus tucked a blanket around Tonks, resting a hand on her belly.
“Do you think he’ll ever know peace?” he whispered.
“Only if we keep fighting for it,” she murmured, half-asleep.

Outside, Sirius stood on the balcony beside Isabel, the sea reflecting in their eyes.
“They’re laughing again,” he said quietly.
“They deserve to,” she answered. “Even if it’s the last time before the storm.”
He took her hand. “Then we’ll make it count.”

⸻

💌 The Letter

Inside, one light still burned.
Lyra sat by the window, moonlight spilling over parchment. A sleek black owl had delivered it moments ago.
The handwriting was neat, precise… and trembling.

She unfolded it carefully.

⸻

Lyra,

If my mother knew I was writing you, she’d hex me first and hug me later. I’m not sure which would hurt more.

You’ll probably call me dramatic — you usually do — and you’d be right. I’m not brave, Lyra. I’ve never been.
But lately, I’m starting to hate that about myself.

Things here are… darker. My father won’t say it aloud, but I can feel it. There are meetings I’m not meant to attend, doors I’m not supposed to open, and whispers about a task that sounds like a death sentence no matter who it’s for.

I can’t tell you details. You know why. But I need you to believe me when I say I never wanted this. I never wanted any of it.

Sometimes I think about that day at Hogwarts — the fireworks you and your sister set off in Umbridge’s office. You were laughing while everyone else hid.
And I remember thinking — maybe courage looks different on everyone.

I’m not asking for forgiveness. Just… don’t hate me if I do something foolish.

— D.

Also I score much better on CARS when I do passages at night (after the focus part wears off but I’m still pretty awake). 

I’m thinking of stopping it for my next retake because this is the last thing I haven’t tried yet and my sleep has been crap on it, but everytime I don’t take it for a day I go through withdrawals where I have zero motivation and sleep the day away. Idk if it’s worth it to go cold turkey for a few weeks and then try studying with maybe coffee or smthn.

Most of the books and lists I've seen include socialization at places like:

* Grocery stores
* Coffee shops
* Schools
* Libraries
* etc

In an ideal world I'd like to do some short 10-15 minute socialization outings to these places as we build confidence between the 8-14 week age with my puppy. Ideally using a puppy stroller at first before paws on the ground.

1o0pxrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1o0pxrp/review_of_cardinal_scents_and_some_random_sunday/,Review of Cardinal Scents and some random Sunday Destash goodies,"Hello everyone! I’ve been on a low-buy recently, so I thought it would be fun to smush a review together of some stuff I’ve bought from others on IMAM along with some samples I got from Cardinal Scents, which was my last “direct” order!

A bit about my preferences: I love incense, resins, apples, hay, and most forest/woods type scents. I love me a good atmospheric, especially if I can tie it directly to a memory or two. I lean away from straight gourmands- I prefer they have a little “edge” to them. If I’m gonna smell like pumpkin pie and vanilla ice cream, I wanna smell like pumpkin pie and vanilla ice cream that was served in the middle of midnight mass at a haunted cathedral. 

**Cardinal Scents**

I ordered via Etsy before she closed to catch up on orders and take a break. I really hope that if she decides to re-open, Haley returns on track, because I’m impressed with these scents (even the one that didn’t work!). 

**Pop Astrology**: *nag champa incense, cream soda, bubblegum, white musk.*

This starts with a burst of bubble gum, like opening a pack of bubble tape with that powdery residue on it- it’s sweet and it’s exactly what I imagine the color pink would smell like! And ugh, that beautiful nag champa incense, sweet and warm. The white musk adds a touch of sophistication, like paging through your mom’s magazines and opening up one of the perfume samples to make you feel adult. This reminds me of flipping through teen magazines and reading our star signs  or playing with tarot decks at a high school sleepover. It’s listening to post-punk at the vintage record shop I worked at in my twenties, with its bright colored walls and the bundles of nag champa incense I’d burn to lure in customers. This is a keeper and worthy of a full size. 


**Girl Crush:** *(hazelnut cappuccino, raspberry body spray, pear shampoo, warm skin.)*

This is gas station cappuccino and I mean that in the best way possible. Rich and sweet and pairs perfectly with the raspberry, like sitting at a coffee shop with your crush in your freshman year of college and this is what you order. Or perhaps it’s early morning at school and you get a cappuccino out of the vending machine to go with your Pop-Tarts. As it dries it does become more shampoo-y on me (much in the way that some scents become soapy) and reminiscent of taking a big huff of a fresh bottle of Herbal Essences. That hazelnut note remains, however. I LOVE this and it’s also worthy of full size. 

**Witch Hat:** *black plum, caramel, wormwood, patchouli*

This is a very heady scent, full of spice and plum. Unlike the other Cardinal Scents goodies, I can’t seem to place this one. It’s holding an elusive memory. I don’t see myself wearing this much, though. As lovely as it is, the plum isn’t quite my style. 

**Once bitten:** *chocolate covered cherry, white honeycomb, whipped cream, patchouli, skin musk.*

This is strong on the chocolate-cherry. It brings to mind running around the mall and hitting Buddy Squirrel or Gloria Jean’s.  This isn’t something I personally vibe with though- I’m not a fan of chocolate-forward perfumes, but it does bring good memories back! I destashed this one and hopefully it will get more love in someone else’s hands!

**and now for the random destash scents!**

**Alchemic Muse Countrycide:** *darkened heart of musky clover, caramelized benzoin, beeswax, and black vanilla absolute. At the center is a corrupted foundation of bitter almond, tonka bean, gaiacwood and sandalwood, waiting to be revealed for a sensual and unforgettable experience.*

What a complex scent at first sniff! At first whiff it’s reminiscent of a freshly sliced apple thats been dropped in a pile of leaves. Oddly specific but I’m not sure how else to say it! I get a bit of that lovely bergamot and dry golden hay. Unfortunately though, this turns plastic at the end of its life- I think I would love this as a hair mist or body whip more than a perfume. 

**Crow Moon 2025:** * An ironic caw: dry hay absolute, syrupy candied fig, a lash of scathing pink pepper, and the dark gleam of bittersweet blackcurrant.*

On first application and sniff this is..weirdly soapy and clean. Not at all what I expected from the description. Then, as suddenly as a murder of crows bursts from the autumn trees, I’m getting rich, syrupy dark fruits. then holy cats, dark juicy fruit, a bit of hay, and just a kiss of spice. 

**Organic Perfume Girl Fox in the Snow:**
*Deep rich dark woods / Snow Blooming Flowers / Douglass Fir, Coast Redwood, Seqoia, White Cedar*

I’ve never heard of this house before, but foxes are one of my favorite animals so I had to try this. This reminds me a lot of a Solstice Scents scent- perhaps Night Watcher? Regardless this is a fantastic coniferous forest scent.  It doesn’t give me the winter vibes I’d hoped for, but it’s a lovely forest perfume for when you’re craving a hike through the wilderness but are stuck staring at spreadsheets. 

**Obscura Hortus The Autumn People** * *Ancient frankincense, and amber create a strange fog that billows from the midnight steam engine. It mixes with hints of sweet apples, pumpkins, and black tea that hover in the atmosphere around the sleepy autumn town. The presence of dark patchouli and vanilla lingers in the shadows with the dust witch.*

Oh my god. This one is instantly in my Pantheon of Autumn GOATs. Crunchy autumn leaves! The sexy dark combination of frankincense and amber! It’s earthy and a little spicy, just a kiss and a whisper of apple and pumpkin to add some subtly sweet ~fall vibes.~ I love love love it.

* I emailed that address, but then got a reply from a completely different email address, supposedly a “work email”, except it was a hotmail.com one (lol).

I asked them twice by email to power the units on and send a video (to make it feel more trustworthy), but he ignored that and only sent photos. Anyone can grab photos from other listings online. Even AI thinks it could be a scam.

1o0pv1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1o0pv1a/my_frustrations_with_the_xbloom_studio/,My frustrations with the XBloom studio.,"Hi, I purchased an XBloom Studio about seven months ago after becoming quite frustrated with my inability to get consistent results from daily pour-overs. I figured this machine would take much of the human error out of the equation and deliver great-tasting coffee with minimal effort.

While it does make excellent coffee when paired with the right recipe for the right beans, I’ve been struggling to dial in coffees from roasters that aren’t offered through XBloom. The pods they sell are extremely expensive, so I’ve never purchased any and instead I order my own beans from various roasters.

The issue is that none of the roasters I buy from have recommended recipes available in the XBloom app—or even in third-party apps where users upload their own custom recipes. It becomes a process of trial and error, tinkering with different parameters to come up with a recipe that brings out the best in the beans I’m using. At this point, it often feels like I’m just making my own pour-over, except with an automated machine doing the pouring for me.

So I’m curious—are there others here who use the XBloom, and have you been satisfied with your results when using non-pod coffees? I think it’s an awesome machine and have definitely gotten some great cups from it, but I like to experiment with new roasts every few weeks, and it can be challenging to dial things in when you’re not very knowledgeable about pour-overs.

I tried fiber gummies, laxatives, even prune juice (don’t recommend 😅).  
Nothing worked consistently — until I realized it wasn’t about *adding more fiber*, it was about **timing + hydration + small movement**.

Here’s what fixed it for me:  
1️⃣ Morning water before coffee (huge difference).  
2️⃣ 5-minute walk after each meal.  
3️⃣ A daily checklist so I could actually see patterns — when I tracked, things improved fast.

Once I put it all in one place, I stopped stressing.  
If anyone wants the exact tracker/routine I use, I linked it in my bio.
