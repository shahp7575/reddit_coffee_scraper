1ozew8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1ozew8c/starting_over/,Starting over,"Hi there. I’m writing this from a place I didn’t quite expect to be at in my late 30s - getting divorced, gay, and learning how to rebuild a life that feels like mine again. It’s strange, liberating, scary, and exciting all at once.

So here I am, doing something I’ve never done before: putting out a genuine call for friendship. I’ve lost myself in someone else’s life for the last little while. 

If you’re in or around DC or NoVa, maybe also navigating transitions, maybe also queer, maybe just someone who values good conversation and genuine connection—I’d love to meet you. I’m looking for friends to grab coffee with, explore the city, laugh at the absurdity of adulthood, talk about life, hike, find great food, go to queer events, or just sit on the couch with takeout after a long week.
A little about me:
• late 30s, lesbian
• Recovering from a tough chapter but hopeful for what’s next
• Loves bookstores, dogs, art, road trips, and people who can appreciate awkward humor
• Trying to say yes to more things, even when it feels scary
If you’re also building or rebuilding your circle, or just want to expand it, I’d love to connect. Sometimes friendship starts with something as simple as “hi,” so… hi.",1,1763382276.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

As America is deep into football season, the USPTO is lining up under center to remind everyone that **teamwork, tenacity, and thoughtfulness** are the real keys to victory! 💪📜

After all, innovation isn’t a solo sport — it’s a full-contact collaboration! 🤝

Just ask the inventors behind:

🏈 **U.S. Patent No. 1,559,117** — the ellipsoid football! Proof that with a little hot air, anything is possible. 😉

🪖 **U.S. Patent No. 9,943,128** — the helmet impact sensor. Because safety’s the best defense (and, let’s face it, the best offense too)!

🏆 **Trademark Reg. No. 882,283** — Super Bowl®, the Big Game™ itself, that reminds us you can’t spell “brandwagon” without “brand”!

Here at America's Innovation Training Camp, we’re all about **moving the goalposts (like U.S. Patent No. 3,908,992) — in the best possible way**! Whether you’re running a search, reviewing a claim, or calling an audible on your workflow, remember:

* 📑 Every application’s a new play.

* 🧠 Every Office Action’s a chance for a comeback.

* 🦾 And every after-final amendment is just a *two-minute drill for improvement*!

So grab your coffee, check your metrics, and get ready to *give 110%* (because we ran the numbers, and **95% just wasn’t enough**)! 📈

Let’s make this week a *winning drive* for innovation:

Don’t fumble your filings!

Keep your morale flags down!

And remember, in the great game of patents — even when you’re under (streamlined) review, **you’re always in play**!

Stay productive, stay positive, and stay in formation!

Let’s punt burnout, tackle excellence, and score big for our stakeholders! 🦅

1ozeq1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeudalistParty/comments/1ozeq1u/ultimate_truth_of_life/,ultimate truth of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1763381748.0,FeudalistParty,0,1.0,False

1ozeoy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/techiesgonemad/comments/1ozeoy8/a_tiny_onpage_seo_trick_that_quietly_boosts/,A tiny On-page SEO trick that quietly boosts rankings (and barely takes 2 minutes),"Okay, sharing a super underrated SEO hack that I swear more people should use — and it’s so simple you’ll wonder why you weren’t already doing it.

# Add a “People Also Ask–style” mini FAQ at the bottom of your article.

Not a full-blown FAQ page… just 2–3 short Q&As that directly answer related search questions.

Why this works:

1. **Google LOVES clear, concise answers.** When you give clean answers in an FAQ format, Google often picks them up for snippets or PAA boxes.
2. **You naturally sprinkle long-tail keywords.** Without overthinking it or stuffing keywords like a robot.
3. **It boosts topical relevance.** You’re basically telling Google, “Hey, I understand everything around this topic — not just the main keyword.”
4. **It improves user experience.** People get quick answers, which increases dwell time and reduces bounce rates.

Here’s a small example:

**Q: Is black coffee good for weight loss?**  
A: Yes — when consumed without sugar or milk, black coffee may boost metabolism slightly.

**Q: How many cups of coffee a day is safe?**  
A: Most research suggests up to 3–4 cups for healthy adults.

Clean. Simple. Helpful.

# Bonus tip:

Mark your FAQ with **FAQ schema**.  
It takes 30 seconds and can help your result appear bigger in SERPs — which = more clicks.

This tiny addition has helped several of my pages jump a few spots without changing anything else.

Try it on one article and see how Google reacts over the next 1–2 weeks.

There is no specific intent expect having a good company and genuine conversation. Ping me if you're on same boat as I'm.  ",1,1763381443.0,punemeetup,4,1.0,False
1ozemb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1ozemb6/which_smart_plugs_for_remote_control_needs/,Which smart plugs for remote control needs?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting asked a lot lately about smart plugs for remote control, and honestly, I was in the same boat a few months ago trying to figure out which ones actually work well.

Let me save you some time and headaches.

**What I Actually Use Them For**

I started using smart plugs because I kept leaving my coffee maker on when I rushed out for work. Now I can turn it off from my phone wherever I am. Pretty simple stuff, but it's saved me from worrying about burning my house down more times than I'd like to admit.

I also have one controlling a lamp in my living room, and another on a space heater in my bedroom. Being able to schedule when things turn on and off without getting out of bed? Yeah, that's worth it.

**The Important Stuff You Need to Know**

Here's what matters when you're picking wireless outlet switches:

First, make sure they work with your WiFi. Most need 2.4GHz, not the 5GHz network. I learned this the hard way after spending 20 minutes wondering why mine wouldn't connect.

Second, check if they work with Alexa or Google Home if you use voice control. Not all of them do, which is annoying when you find out after buying them.

Third, look at the app reviews. Some apps are garbage and make the whole experience frustrating. The good ones let you set schedules easily and actually connect when you need them to.

**Where I Found the Best Options**

After trying a few different brands, I found that checking out [multiple smart plug options here](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) helped me compare features and prices without driving myself crazy. Amazon usually has the best selection since you can read real reviews from people who've actually used them.

**My Honest Take**

You don't need anything fancy. The basic models work fine for most people. I use mine for automated scheduling, remote access when I'm not home, and energy monitoring so I can see what's actually using power.

The mini versions are great if you don't want to block both outlets on your wall plate. I wish someone had told me that before I bought the bigger ones.

**Bottom Line**

Smart plugs are one of those things that seem unnecessary until you have them. Now I can't imagine not being able to control my devices remotely. Whether you're automating lights, controlling appliances from work, or just want to make your home a bit smarter without spending a fortune, they're worth checking out.

If you want to see what's available and compare different models, [check out the options on Amazon](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs). Read the reviews, watch for sales, and start with one or two to test them out before going all in.

Hope this helps someone out there who's on the fence about these things!",1,1763381440.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

Honestly, thank you to everyone who came by to see us last weekend at Intersect and this weekend at Minutes + Hours Watch Show 

The venues were wonderful but the ATX community was so so POWERFUL!! We saw CW on so many wrists from all kinds of collections of the present and recent past. 

The new Sealander Extreme GMTs, the Jump Hours and of course the new Bel Canto Lumiere were the stars of the shows but once again, Tridents, Sealanders and Twelves (our core) found new homes deep in the heart of Texas!

Not going to lie, I’m feeling the burn as we continue to get through a memorable year for the brand but I’m so bloody proud of Trey and my team as we push to one last huge achievement…opening NEW YORK CITY!!!

CW HQ opened a showroom in London today (congrats to you all) and so to have two places in two of the greatest cities on earth showcasing our watches is so incredibly exciting. 

If you see me, give me a hug and a coffee lol

1ozel8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_sayandas1998/comments/1ozel8m/do_you_truly_need_an_sds_for_nonhazardous/,Do You Truly Need an SDS for Non-Hazardous Materials? The Quick Answer Is: Nope,"Let's be realistic: if you're employed in EHS, manufacturing, laboratory work, or any position that meets chemicals, chances are you've looked at an SDS at some point and wondered, ""Do we really need this for everything?"" The response may shock you—non-hazardous products aren't legally required to have an SDS, according to OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard. But don't go ahead and toss those drab documents into the recycling bin just yet (isn't there always a catch?). 

# The Simple-Sounding Rule Requires You to Dive Deep 

Here's the catch: OSHA only requires SDSs for hazardous chemicals. If what you have doesn't qualify under the hazard criteria—i.e., it won't physically harm someone, have any health effects, or damage the environment—then technically, you don't require an SDS. Sounds easy, doesn't it? Not. 

The catch? What really qualifies as ""hazardous"" is a heck of a lot more complex than most are aware of. A product that is innocuous in one scenario may become dangerous in another based on how it is utilized, how frequently, and where. This is where many workplace safety professionals get caught short. 

**When Non-Hazardous Materials Are Truly Exempt** 

Let's discuss the products that actually do not need an SDS under any condition: 

* Food and Beverages: When you're having a sandwich or coffee at your workspace, no SDS is Necessary. The same applies to food prepared or retailed. 
* Cosmetics and Personal Care Products: That lotion in the break room or the lip balm on your desk? Exempt. Even cosmetics employees use in the workplace don't need an SDS. 
* Medications and Drugs: Over-the-counter pain meds, first aid materials, prescription medications in retail packaging? All cool, no SDS is necessary. 
* Tobacco Products: Self-explanatory. 
* Unprocessed Wood and Wood Products: A hunk of lumber lingering? Excluded. But the moment you begin to see or mill it, things change. 
* Articles (pre-manufactured items): Here's a doozy: your computer, desk, or that spool of metal wire doesn't need an SDS because it won't release dangerous chemicals during routine use. 
* Biological and Ionizing Radiation: These are regulated by other regulatory frameworks and aren't addressed by OSHA's HazCom standard.  

# The ""Grey Zone"" That Gets Everyone in Trouble  

And then there's the real kicker: consumer goods that are utilized in the workplace. This is where ostensibly ""non-hazardous"" material gets extremely problematic. 

Picture your facility using a typical glass cleaner, disinfectant spray, or general-purpose adhesive. Those are consumer items, aren't they? Perhaps no SDS is required? Wrong again, if your workplace employs them differently from a typical consumer.  

The determining factors are: 

* Frequency of Use: An occasional office worker spraying glass cleaner on their screen? That's a consumer application, so no SDS is needed. But do the janitorial staff do the same product for hours a day? They now need an SDS since the frequency of exposure is more common for consumer use. 
* Exposure Duration: Tying up the occasional misspelling with White-Out? Exempt. Blanking out whole pages daily? Now it needs an SDS. 
* Quantity and Concentration: One squirt of hand sanitizer during the day is not equivalent to a maintenance person habitually using heavy-duty adhesives on a regular basis. 
* Purpose of Use: If the product is being used precisely as the maker intended and in a way that's typical for consumer behavior, it may qualify. If it's being used within an industrial process or in other non-typical manners, all bets are off. 

This is the reason why context is everything. An otherwise harmless consumer item can tip over into ""hazardous workplace chemical"" status if usage patterns shift. 

# So. Should You Get an SDS Anyway? 

Here's the pragmatic bottom line: although OSHA does not mandate SDSs for non-hazardous substances, it is usually a good idea to ask for them anyway. Why? 

* Because ""non-hazardous"" is judgment based on current information, if new hazard data comes up later, having records counts. 
* Because legal teams adore paper trails – Maintaining SDSs, even for seemingly benign products, shows good faith in case of audits or incidents. 
* Because your workplace culture is better – Having available, complete hazard data creates a better safety culture overall. 
* Because regulatory definitions continue to change – What's ""safe"" today can be reclassified tomorrow. 

 

The Bottom Line 

Non-hazardous products actually don't need an SDS under OSHA requirements. But ""hazardous"" vs. ""non-hazardous"" is a heck of a lot less black-and-white than it appears, particularly in professional situations where products are utilized differently from the way general consumers would utilize them. 

The safest wager? Judge each product on how it is really being used in your particular workplace. If you're uncertain, and you generally will be, obtain the SDS. Your safety team will appreciate it, OSHA won't fine you for being overly cautious, and you'll sleep better with the knowledge that you've done your due diligence.

1ozel57,https://www.reddit.com/r/outlast/comments/1ozel57/mamma_mia/,Mamma Mia,"Eddie Gluskin used to go to a coffee shop on the strip mall his tailor shop shares. Normally his order was taken by a guy name Jared who preferred to man the cashier.

That was different on March 5, 1994.

Eddie came in around the time Jared normally was on break, leaving Emma alone behind the counter. Eddie has been keeping a particular eye on her due to nearly making her his sacrificial lamb when he was a boy and she was a little girl.

He found having someone from that miserable chapter of his life in the town that's supposed to be his fresh start aggravating.

Eddie found she's lucky he was catching up old colleague of his.

Emma thought it would be the typical greeting of ""Hello, sir. How may I help you?"" and then take his order.

When Eddie mentioned the character getups he's working on, that piqued her interest, as she knows it involves her favorite Musicals. Eddie further impressed her by sharing his previous involvement with the play. Other than being one of the stage crews, he played Erik, the Phantom himself. Emma could see why he got the role. Tall, intimidating, nice voice, keep himself well-groomed, very skilled in various trades.

Emma fumbled a little but Eddie acted nicely. He complimented her a little to ""throw her a bone"" and get back at his boy arch-enemy.

Flustering from her came easily to him, and he found she was quite attractive. Fairly symmetrical face, jade green eyes, cupid bow-shaped lips, thick locks that caught light like a lit match. He didn't find her skin flawless, but sun-kissed and adorned with some freckles that he found cute and along with a neck he perceives to be lovely. He does find  black lace choker compliments her throat.

What put him off was the gunge style she had from the fringe main to the retrofitted attire.

Eddie has an eye and appreciation for beauty, but he has a preference for styles he finds classy and timeless, both in women and his clients.

During Eddie's conversation with Emma, he was surprised to learn that nemesis was married and that his relationship ended due to death. Eddie couldn't help but glance at Emma's oldest nephew, Archie who leer at him in suspicion, a look that mirrored his father, Mitch. He puzzled a little at the boy's existence since the kid looked about 12. At the time, Eddie was 27, and Mitch was only a year older than him.

He didn't linger further inside when Maury called for him.

\---

""So, Eddie, did you enjoy your conversation with your friend?"" Maury asked, casually.

""Yes, though that was the first time she communicated with me in such a comprehensive manner,"" Eddie replied, his voice thoughtful.

""Comprehensive manner?""

""She usually kept her distance from me, often scurrying away when I was near. I didn't understand why—didn't think I did anything to make her act that way, except for today. When I saw her smile, the one she uses for customers, it had a hint of fear when she faced me. But that fear seemed to fade as we spoke. She looked more comfortable, even glowing, and her tone had more pep.""

""Sounds like Emma might like you,"" Maury said with a knowing grin.

""...I guess that could be the case,"" Eddie muttered. ""How do you know her name?""

""Her little nephew came outside and asked me about what it's like to be a theater director and event coordinator—pretty sharp kid. Sometimes I forget how curious little kids can be.

I decided to reward a kid to play around with Liana for a while.

He gets some answers and fun. I get to leave with a tired pup, which is a good pup for traveling.

Anyway, back to you and the lady that you got pretty caught up with. It appears she had gotten you pretty occupied.""

""I suppose she did,"" Eddie admitted.

""I don't think I've ever seen you so invested in casual conversation with a girl before,"" Maury added, eyeing him curiously.

""Really?""

""Yes, well, besides... um..."" Maury trailed off, uneasy.

""You mean sweet old Mrs. Alhadeff or that whore Eileen?"" Eddie said, his tone flat.

""Yes,"" Maury replied, cringing at the harshness of Eddie's words.

""It’s been five years since I last saw either of them,"" Eddie continued, his mind drifting back to the last time he saw his foster mother before pulling out a cigarette to blow out his frustration.

He then offered the pack to Maury. ""Would you like one too?""

""Sure, thanks,"" Maury replied, taking one and lighting it.

Eddie exhaled slowly, his mind returning to the small town he barely knew. ""Huh, I never noticed. Well, I guess I have to pay attention more now since I hardly knew anyone when I came here. Can't just rely on meeting another chatterbox like you to land an opportunity.""

""Right,"" Maury replied, his mind wandering back to the time he first met Eddie. In it was near fall in 1982. Maury had woken up, and went to the kitchen to make breakfast. The vent was jammed, so he opened the window to let the smoke from his stove escape. He wounded up startling Eddie who was napping on a fire escape, only to be startled when Eddie swung a bag at his head. The bag, though cushioned by clothing, still made an impact.

""What the hell is your problem?!"" Maury had shrieked in pain as he tried to crawl away.

""Oh, I'm so sorry, sir,"" Eddie had apologized, his voice calm and collected. ""I just forgot my keys and was waiting for my parents to come back.""

Maury paused, looking puzzled. ""You're a new tenant here?""

""Yeah,"" Eddie nodded. ""Mom, Dad, and I moved in really late—around midnight. Don’t really remember much since we were exhausted from the trip.""

""How old are you? Are you going to the community college nearby?"" Maury had asked.

""I plan on it,"" Eddie said with a shrug.

""What major are you pursuing?""

""I'm not sure yet.""

Maury thought for a moment. ""Tell you what, I have a catalog from when I went to college. It may not be exactly what you're looking for, but it’s something. And hey, sometimes it's better to put in the effort and keep up your GPA, even if you end up switching majors later. I can mention some unions too. I dropped out, but they really helped me get my footing when I found a job I wanted to pursue.""

Eddie chuckled lightly. ""I'll admit, I was a little excessive with my ranting, and you were mostly zoning out as the big, silent kid who somehow got so tall thanks to 'dear old dad.'""

""Okay, short stack,"" Eddie teased, ""I was mostly agreeing with you because I was nervous. Half the time, I was zoning out.""

""Nervous?"" Maury laughed. ""I was freaking out, feeling like a fish trying to escape a bear until I came to my senses.""

Maury then noticed his dog chewing on the cup that had whipped cream. “Liana, no! Don’t eat the plastic. Here—eat this instead,” he said, waving a burger in front of her. Thankfully, Liana stopped chewing on the trash and happily switched to the burger.

Eddie gave a soft smile. ""Let’s change the topic.""

""Away from when you almost got charged with murder?"" Maury asked with a grin.

""I would prefer that,"" Eddie said quickly. ""So, you’re really going to meet up with a bunch of people you don’t even know for what, a doggy family reunion?""

Maury smiled, his eyes softening. ""I think it’ll be great for her to see her mom and siblings again. Plus, I want to meet the other kind people who helped make this possible. There’s a charming, cheesy lady who’ll be there too.""

Maury raised an eyebrow, and Eddie leaned back with a smirk. ""Let me guess, it's the famous Celine?""

""Yeah,"" Maury sighed, his face lighting up with a grin. 

""What makes her so special that you’re willing to travel a few states to see her?"" Eddie asked, curiosity piqued.

""She's there for her father, who doesn't have much time left,"" Maury explained, his tone soft. ""I would like to also commission you for the wedding my fiance and I intend to have? Celine does want to be brought down the aisle and have her daddy-daughter dance. I intend to ensure that does happens.""

""You're serious about this girl.""

""I am, do find I'm incredibly lucky to encounter Celine. She has been incredibly patient with me and you know how I like to drag on conversations even if the topic isn’t all that important. I can imagine happily living the rest of my life with her. Plus Liana would absolutely be exhilarated live her sister Olive again. What may be a challenge is trying not to get dragged when the two furballs go in hot pursuit of a squirrel and bathing them.""

""That's quite the trade off,"" Eddie Snorted 

""I think the the inside joke, the toot Celine has when we startled is worth it. Of course there is more to it but I think you got the gist.""

""I think about two hours about her on our last phone call a 'gist' is an understatement.""

""Right...""

Eddie’s smile faded into a knowing grin. ""Well Maury,"" he said softly, ""I need to get back to work.""

Maury looked guilty. ""Okay, again, it is great too see you again.""

""It's wonderful to see you too and congratulations,"" Eddie reassured him. ""I'll keep you update with the progress and ask for further details for the day you'll get married. 

The two boxed up their leftover lunch, waved goodbye, and went their separate ways.

 Eddie remembered the day he met Maury. It was also the same day he met his foster mother, Mrs. Alhadeff. She was holding a heavy bag of groceries and asked him to help her open the door. She then invited him to join her for a late lunch, an offer which Eddie accepted. Mrs. Alhadeff was outgoing, kind, and missed her family, who were killed during the holocaust. She caught herself accidentally calling him by one of her deceased sons name so she resorted to calling ""Darling"" or ""son."" Mrs. Allender brought him to events she was paid for, participated and engaged in. Eddie didn't fully trust being emotionally vulnerable around anyone, even her. Similar to his previous situations, he tried not to stick out and blend into her world.

Becoming skilled in customizing clothes became a necessity as he grew rapidly and massively. Lucky Mrs. Alhadeff was a seamstress, so he had a good teacher in that regard. She enjoyed making him look handsome, and he found that people approached him more easily. She set up stages, celebrations, and events to the point that it became a consistent source of revenue for him. He also watched shows with her, which tended to be ones from the 1950s or earlier, where he gleaned some of his insights on how to appear to people. Eddie also snipped scenes from motion pictures to use as some ""memories"" to tell in place of what were supposed to be the days of innocence.

He became skilled with the threads, setups for stages, celebrations, and events to the point that it became his consistent source of income.

He did care for Mrs. Alhadeff, but gradually, things changed in a way that further... complicated things. At first, it was small lapses—forgotten groceries, misplaced items, being locked out—always followed by apologies. But soon, her errors grew: she mismanaged schedules, sent invitations on the wrong dates, or overlooked friends who had passed away. Eddie began to trust her less with important tasks, limiting her to simple or familiar chores. When she noticed, she would confront him:

“I’m your distant cousin. My parents requested me to keep an eye on you.”

***“Liar!”*** she snapped.

 He wound up pretending to be one of her sons who died in the concentration camps. Her body atrophied, and she was gradually reluctant to eat or take her medication. She had these alarming moment in which she wail and shriek in panicked Italian and Greek. The fear she carried in her eyes during these occurrences frequently looked in Eddie's direction. He's **loathed** it, ***he was sick of it!***

Eddie Gluskin remember her murmurs. Her boney fingers balling around the fabric yanking, writhing against his hands, then his wrist. Her grip eventually soften, slid, then her arms fell.

""Mà?"" Eddie said.

His hands began to shake; he took them close to examine. Then he looked at his foster mother. Pillow over her head and still.

Eddie brought his palm over his eyes and his fingers wrapped around his eye he sat on the floor beside her bed.

Denying what he had done as he rocked himself. When he place his foot solid on the floor his back on side rails he slid his hands off his face and have his elbow lean on his knees. After a moment of silent he decides to talk to Mrs. Alhadeff.

“Hello?... Ciao?...Geiá sou?.. Mà… Are you asleep? Are you sure you want to skip supper? I can make it right now… Call me if you change your mind, or if you need anything.”

Eddie stood up and march where he intended to keep the validity of his excuse. The three stove dial went- click click click before the burners went-poof. He brought out a pot and pan, and all landed with a clink. He preheated the oven.

He brought out a jug of water and a jar of broth from the fridge, then retrieved carrots, onions, celery, and a rotisserie chicken. From small cellar he took out the garlic and potatoes.

The seal gave a pop and pssst. He shook some floor in it before he placed the brew into the one of the shallower vessel, next he added water to the taller one. While waiting for the liquid to bubbles he slid out a knife from the drawers.

Eddie chopped up the vegetables afterwards he carve the breast from the poultry to shred.

He boiled the potatoes.

Sauteed the vegetables then combined the slurry, and the thinly sliced meat. He drained the potatoes threw it in the blend with some milk. He regretted it as soon as the machine ran—not because it didn’t work, but because of its screams. Eddie decorated the top in the weaving pattern before he set it in the oven.

While it bake he went into the living room, sat down then turn on the television. It was playing ""Leave it to Beaver.""

""Mà,"" Eddie called out ,""our favorite show is on. Are you sure you want to miss it?""

No other sounds.

""C'mon Mà,"" Eddie continued as he got up to walk through the hallway, ""it's not like you to ever miss it.""

He stopped at the doorway of her bedroom. Still not liking the idea of what he'll see once he passes that point. He tiptoed slowly inside. His hand unsteadily wandered under what he covered Mrs. Alhadeff's face with. He instantly pulled away from the sensation of her eyes were wide in her sockets. He squeezes his lids and clench his grips to form a fist. He uncurled his fingers to forced himself pull town her lids. He yank off the pillow.

""Oh good, you really are asleep,"" he lied to himself again.

""I know you may not hear me but I'm there for you mom. Again if you need anything just yell out and I'll be at your service.""

Eddie ate slowly. His appetite wasn't there but he took every last bite as if savoring his last meal.

Maury was wondering for a while why neither Eddie or Mrs. Alhadeff was around for a while. He had chalked it up that Mrs. Alhadeff was having one of her episodes that made it rather overwhelming for Eddie to bring her out it public but still something was itching the back of Maury's neck. He dialed the phone.

*ring... ring.... ri-*

""Hello?"" came Eddie's voice on the line.

""Hi Eddie how are you and Mrs. Alhadeff are doing?""

""I'm doing well. As for my Mà she's a bit... under the weather.""

""Right... I'm sorry I didn't check in more frequently on the both of you."" Maury apologized, then asked ""Is it okay I stop by?""

""Sure,"" Eddie replied, my mother will be delighted to see you around?""

He came to the floor the two resided on and gave a knock. Maury looked down at the door unlatch, then his eyes crawled up to meet Eddie's. Eddie's wide smile and intense his stare gave off grimace and the likelihood of lunging at one wrong move rather than a warm greeting for Maury.

Maury stopped himself from entering with the stench that hit his nose. He swallowed his vomit and made an excuse that he forgot the care package he made for Mrs. Alhadeff.

Maury walked at a consistent tempo, keeping his ears keep and fighting his temptation to look over his shoulders.

He called some of the members about the situation. He bought a few items, ring his back up into the building, then knocked the door again. Eddie welcomed them inside.

They saw that Mrs. Alhadeff was no just breathing but was a sickly greenish black. They looked back at Eddie subconsciously having the need to huddle closer together under his gaze. Maury and the group adjusted their posture. They improvise their conversation Eddie so they could collect Mrs. Alhadeff's body and prepare her funeral. Eddie chosen the clothes he believed Mrs. Alhadeff wanted to be buried in the one she had worn when she met her husband. The customization kept him fixed until her placement in a casket. The work was seamless.

""You did a good job Ed,"" Maury said, ""I think she is grateful for what you've done. She has been in health... and likely deep down when she wasn't entirely there... Even now too.""

""She's gone."" Eddie said flatly.

Maury frown. At that moment When he looked at Eddie he saw that teen he met on the balcony. The same boy had an intuition he was being deceitful. That was confirmed right by the conversation he once had with Mrs. Alhadeff. She given the same fib as Maury. She had fried some katimeria to greet the fabricated parents Eddie had mentioned only for him to runaway. Mrs. Alhadeff him encountered again at their local sleeping hunched over a study desk with the same duffle bag that he clung onto. She asked if Eddie would like to string together a story they could tell together if it would make it more comfortable for Eddie to come and stay with her. What Maury saw was someone who believed he was alone once more.

Maury tried to place a hand on Eddie's shoulder, an offer Eddie side stepped away from.

Eddie looked at the framed images. One held Mrs. Alhadeff when she her mind could allow her to function in the present. Scene when she was young and in love with her husband. A family portrait taken before he was born. Eddie still curls when in front of lenses or multiple pairs of eyes when he's not consciously keeping himself upright.

More approached him with condolences. The same faces that had greeted with open arms to his foster mother when she had her fortitude. The same faces he saw went through grieving when she was still breathing but in a sense decaying. Eddie Gluskin seethed inside finding most of them likely found relief from her passing.

""You've been strong for your mother... and allow her not be alone before her final rest.""

He didn't remember the name of who said that but his mind clung onto those words.

""Yeah... That's true.""

Eddie found when he stepped closer to the empty apartment he became slower. The picture frames that were above the fireplace, was now in a casket, making the space emptier Eddie put on the television, he can't stand where silence and stagnancy can take his mind. Eddie kept where she died, where he killed her closed.

There is just one issue that is bothering me slightly: I feel like my Espresso cools down a little too fast after extraction. Warming up my cup is not optional, I strictly need to do that to ensure a good drinking temperature.

I have some experience with making coffee from different machines, and I have always found that an espresso is hot enough to drink directly without pre-warming the cup.

To give you some more information: when I brew with the 9barista, steam starts appearing from the chimney after 4.5-5 minutes and the coffee will start showing up just seconds later.

Please read the pack of your protein milk carefully before using. If you’re using processed protein supplements to add to your coffee including, but not limited to, whey protein powder or protein milk, please be mindful about how much you’re heating them.

Heating isolated protein is a nuanced topic, and some studies hint that heating processed protein can cause it to denature depending on the temperature, time, and various other factors. Many brands, for this reason and to offer a reliable taste and experience, write statements like “do not heat” on their protein drinks.

While heating milk to 55°C may be okay (that’s the temperature people generally recommend for latte art), certain protein-fortified drinks may still experience some change in texture or taste when warmed. Products like protein milk are usually tested by the manufacturer only for direct, chilled consumption, not for heating, so the company cannot guarantee the same smoothness or flavor when used in hot drinks. While you will still get the protein, its behavior in the drink may be different from what the product was designed for.",0,1763381212.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.5,False

It’s completely okay if you don’t vibe with the flavour at first… even coffee is bitter when you start! Matcha has its own learning curve, but what truly makes the difference is the quality you try.

Good matcha can change your entire experience. So before deciding whether you love it or not, make sure you’re tasting the real, well-sourced stuff. 💚✨

From my conversations with friends and matcha lovers, I’ve realised it’s not a flex — it’s genuinely transformative for many.
Here’s what people often share:
	•	Women dealing with PCOD or hormonal issues notice clearer skin and better balance.
	•	Men talk about improved gut health, reduced bloating, and better workout stamina.
	•	Overall skin clarity and glow improving for both.
	•	Steady energy and focus without the jittery crash of coffee.
	•	A noticeable boost in productivity and mood across the board.

Matcha isn’t just a trend — the results people experience are genuinely remarkable. 🌿✨

Never. The finality of death never appealed to me, I’d rather just ride out the storms to the depths of hell, I’d rather run up to it and teeter on the edge and admire it, but I’ve never wanted to give into it. I’ll puke and pull back and crawl and sob my face off before I let anyone, anything, do me in before I’m ready. I’m going to die when I’m old and white and smelly and senile and asleep, I’ll welcome the end when *I* am ready, and not a word sooner. And even then, it won’t be the end. I love the *after* too much, the way colours seem brighter, the rain falling a little calmer, the lights from underneath my first full sized Christmas tree a bit brighter. I love the hope that only lives in the rock bottom, the knowledge that it can only get better from here, the relief when it does, the sweetness of knowing *I* can *do this* in any situation that arises. I am in a dance with life, I am a partner to death, swirling and turning and dipping and laughing. The only time I face God is when I want, not in hubris and greed, but in humility and love and grace. We meet for coffee every morning and I tell Him how I’ve played His game, loved His love, and live the life He gave me my own way. I am grateful and demanding, desired only by cockroaches and a Corpse. I exchange vows with only myself, and He smiles at me. He only speaks to me when I’ve drunk and snorted and laughed and yelled from my soapbox to the dirty dishes. Death met me in a dream, and that is the only way I’ll meet Him.

Sleeping through the night.,"He's been easy to put to bed for months. Rocking for 5 minutes would do the trick, then we'd get him completely flat over a 10 minute period to limit spit up before laying him down. He would wake after 4 or 5 hours for a bottle, we'd repeat the bedtime rocking routine, and he'd be out for another 3 hours. Then, out of nowhere, he started sleeping through the night at 13 weeks and I was so excited! Four nights of uninterrupted sleep after being the only one with night duty for three months was the biggest win I've ever experienced. 

But now we're on night 4 of taking 30 minutes to an hour to fall asleep, waking the moment he's set down in his crib, flinging his body every which way to stay awake, crying unless we bend down and cradle him in his crib, waking at the slightest sound, sleeping for two hours, and then waking every 30 minutes to an hour for the rest of the night unless I hold him *all night*. 

And somehow, between the 2:30 am wake up and the 3 am wakeup, while I sit in the rocker staring at my baby who's definitely a war criminal trained in the art of sleep deprivation, my brain has begun actively blaming all of this on my husband. Are we on the same side? Yes. Would I turn on him in an instant for 4 blissful hours of uninterrupted sleep? Also, yes. 

I came to work three hours early today (5 am). I've been up since midnight keeping the baby from waking everyone else in the house. He *finally* fell asleep long enough for me to get dressed at 4:40. I've checked his camera every few minutes since getting to work (it's now 6) and he's still asleep. This isn't helping my husband's case (the one he doesn't know he's fighting). 

If my husband gets his way and the baby's first word is ""dada"", I'm revolting. That will be all the evidence I need of collusion. I'll grab my keys and wallet and go out for a pack of cigarettes hand rolled by keebler elves and a gallon of organic, ethically sourced, free range unicorn milk and won't come back until I find both.


Disclaimer: I do love my husband. I know he is not secretly crushing up 100 mg caffeine pills and sprinkling them into the baby's bedtime bottles (I think). But for some reason, I still want to replace his coffee with decaf. ",6,1763380696.0,beyondthebump,2,1.0,False

1ozeckn,https://i.redd.it/ye2ydaas3t1g1.png,Mercury Retrograde 2025: 4 Warning Signs Your Marriage Needs Attention Before November 25th,"*I knew something was off three weeks before my husband and I had “the talk.”*

“It wasn’t dramatic — no one mentioned divorce or sleeping on the couch. It was quieter than that, and somehow worse. We were still saying “I love you” when we hung up the phone, but I’d catch myself saying it automatically, like checking off a box. Anniversary dinner reservations made, but neither of us mentioned what year it was or why it mattered anymore. We talked about his meeting running late and whether we needed milk, and somewhere in all that coordination, we’d stopped actually talking at all.

I’d been meditating every morning, journaling about gratitude. On paper, I was doing all the healing work. But sitting across from him at breakfast, I realized I’d been using spiritual practice to *cope with* the distance rather than *close* it.

When I mentioned the emotional static to my astrologer, she didn’t pause: “You’re in the pre-retrograde shadow. Mercury enters Scorpio’s shadow November 7th. What you’re feeling now? It’s the preview.”

By the time Mercury retrograde 2025 hit on November 25th, we’d already had three versions of the same fight, unearthed resentments I didn’t know I was carrying, and somehow — thank god — started actually talking again.

The pre-shadow period saved us. It gave us a three-week warning before the full communication breakdown hit.

**Key Dates:**

* **Pre-Shadow:** Nov 7–24, 2025 (Early warning period)
* **Retrograde:** Nov 25-Dec 15, 2025 (Peak intensity)
* **Post-Shadow:** Dec 15-Jan 2, 2026 (Integration)

# What Is the Pre-Retrograde Shadow (And Why It Matters for Your Marriage)

Mercury retrograde gets all the press — missed flights, ex-texts, tech meltdowns. But the pre-retrograde shadow is where real marriage problems surface, and most of us miss it because we’re maintaining the illusion that everything’s fine.

Mercury enters its pre-retrograde shadow November 7th, stations retrograde at 9° Sagittarius on November 25th, and retrogrades back to 23° Scorpio by December 15th. The pre-shadow — those first 18 days — is your early warning system.

In Scorpio, this isn’t about misplaced keys. Mercury in Scorpio governs *hidden truths* — things married couples don’t say out loud. Resentments filed under “not worth the fight.” Needs we’ve stopped voicing. Emotional distance we’ve grieved quietly because admitting it feels like failure.

The gift? You get to address communication in relationships *before* Mercury retrograde 2025 hits and everything explodes during a holiday argument.

# Why Marriages Struggle During This Transit

Scorpio doesn’t do surface-level. When Mercury moves through this sign during the pre-shadow period, it’s excavating. For those of us who’ve done therapy and read the marriage books, this can feel confronting. You think you’ve done the work — learned your attachment style, identified triggers.

So why does everything suddenly feel fragile?

Here’s what I’ve learned: marriage isn’t something you fix once. It’s something you tend to constantly. The more conscious you become, the more you notice the subtle ways you’re still protecting yourself, still performing the good wife rather than being honest.

I’ve watched Mercury retrograde effects on relationships crack open marriages that looked enviable. But I’ve also seen it save marriages dying quietly — where two people stop reaching for each other emotionally and just exist in parallel.

Mercury in Scorpio’s shadow doesn’t create problems. It *reveals* them. And revelation is the first step toward transformation.

# The 4 Warning Signs (November 7–25)

These aren’t dramatic red flags — they’re whispers. As someone who learned to trust intuition, I can tell you: these signs show up as sensations first. Tightness in your chest when you hear his key in the door. Loneliness while lying next to him.

**1. The Roommate Phase: You’re Co-Managing Life, Not Sharing It**

You coordinate calendars efficiently. You divide tasks. You communicate about groceries, bills, the plumber. But when was the last time you talked about something that *mattered*? Shared a fear, a dream, a vulnerable thought?

You’re having deep thoughts during meditation, processing feelings in therapy — and then you come home and talk about dinner.

**What it means:** You stopped bringing your inner life into your marriage. Maybe after the hundredth distracted “mmhmm.” Maybe after kids, when every conversation became logistics. Maybe vulnerability stopped feeling safe.

**What to do:** Skip the meta-conversation about how you don’t talk anymore (creates defensiveness). Simply close the distance. Share something real: “I’ve been thinking about \[something meaningful\]. Can I share it with you?”

One of the practitioners on [coto](https://app.coto.world/ZyhzeSgTmYb) specializes in marriage communication readings — clarity about *how* you actually communicate, where disconnection points are, what each partner needs to hear. For women told we’re “overthinking,” having someone validate that this distance is real — that’s relationship advice deeper than typical marriage counseling alternatives.

**2. The Resentment Ledger: You’re Keeping Score**

You notice every time he doesn’t ask about your day but you always ask about his. You’re counting who initiates deeper conversations. You remember every “forgotten” promise to be more present.

**What it means:** Every “it’s fine” when it wasn’t fine made a deposit in the resentment bank. Mercury retrograde 2025’s shadow is the collections notice.

**What to do:** Write everything down — uncensored. Not a letter to give him; an excavation for yourself. “He never asks how I’m really doing.” “I feel emotionally invisible.” “I’m always initiating vulnerable conversations.”

Look for patterns. Emotional availability? Reciprocity in vulnerability? Being truly heard? The pattern tells you the real conversation — not 47 grievances, but the underlying emotional need.

**3. The Emotional Distance: You’re Together But Feel Alone**

You’re in the same room but on different planets. There’s a new quality to the quiet — not comfortable silence, but charged absence. You talk logistics and surface topics, but depth is gone.

Mercury in Scorpio will surface this. Scorpio rules emotional intimacy, and when it’s dying, the absence feels cavernous.

**What it means:** Someone has checked out emotionally. This happens when being honest feels too costly, so you settle for cordial distance. Not bad enough to leave, not good enough to feel alive in.

**What to do:** Name it with compassion: “I miss feeling connected to you emotionally. I feel like we’ve lost something, and I want to find it again.”

I didn’t know what “clearing energetic blocks” meant until I was desperate enough to try it. A friend mentioned relationship energy healing after her own marriage hit a wall, so I booked a session with a practitioner on [coto](https://app.coto.world/ZyhzeSgTmYb), mostly because I didn’t know what else to do. She walked me through “cord-cutting”, releasing unhealthy emotional patterns we’d built over years. She explained that couples accumulate so much unsaid resentment it creates static between them. Like trying to talk through interference. The session was strange and surprisingly emotional. But afterward, something shifted. Not fixed — shifted. Like I could finally breathe in my own marriage again. It made space for us to start talking honestly instead of just managing around each other.

**4. The Past Haunts the Present: Old Wounds Resurface**

You’re discussing holiday plans but bringing up that time three years ago when he dismissed your feelings. Talking about work becomes about that moment he chose his career over your emotional needs during a crisis.

Mercury retrograde effects on relationships famously bring back old wounds, but the pre-shadow is when themes start stirring.

**What it means:** Something you thought you’d processed hasn’t been truly healed. You had the conversation, someone apologized, you “moved on.” But the emotional scar tissue is still there.

**What to do:** Name it with self-compassion: “I thought I was over \[specific incident\] but I’m not emotionally healed from it, and I need to talk about it because it’s affecting how available I can be now.”

This feels like reopening settled matters. But the alternative — letting wounds fester — is worse. Mercury retrograde 2025 will drag it out anyway, usually at the worst time.

**What to Expect After November 25th**

If you’re reading this before November 25th, you still have time. Use November 7–24 to have the hard conversations, address the resentments, and name the emotional distance out loud. If you do, the retrograde becomes refinement rather than explosion. You’ll still revisit themes — that’s the nature of retrograde — but you’ll be refining understanding instead of discovering wounds for the first time mid-crisis.

If you’re reading this after the 25th, that’s okay too. The work is the same, just more urgent. Because once Mercury retrograde 2025 is in full swing, those whispers become screams. Small issues become “I don’t feel emotionally safe with you anymore” fights. But even mid-retrograde, choosing honesty over avoidance can change everything.

**The Transformation Happens in the Discomfort**

Two weeks after that conversation with my husband — the one where I finally named the loneliness I’d been carrying — we started a Sunday morning ritual. Coffee, no phones, asking each other one real question. “What’s something you haven’t told me lately?” “What’s been weighing on you?”

It’s not perfect. Sometimes we still default to logistics. But it’s connection. It’s choosing to close the distance instead of managing around it.

The pre-shadow period isn’t comfortable. Having avoided conversations isn’t romantic. But this is the real work — not the anniversary-post version.

Mercury in Scorpio’s shadow isn’t trying to destroy your marriage. It’s showing what needs attention before emotional cracks become failures. It’s asking you to stop performing emotional wellness and start being emotionally honest.

**For Women Still Learning**

If you’re recognizing yourself in these signs: you’re not failing. Noticing these patterns isn’t dysfunction — it’s emotional consciousness.

We’re told marriage should be your emotional safe haven. Then we realize: marriage is also emotionally complex, sometimes disappointing, and requires choosing emotional honesty over and over even when it’s hard.

Use these 18 days. Have the conversations. Clear the resentment ledger. Name the emotional distance and say you want connection back.

Your marriage doesn’t need perfection. It needs honesty.

The conversations you have now determine whether Mercury retrograde 2025 refines your marriage or exposes there isn’t enough foundation left. Choose the hard conversation today. Breathe through it. Trust yourself.

It’s easier than tomorrow’s explosion, and far more aligned with the person you’re becoming.[](https://medium.com/tag/astrology?source=post_page-----24b2c29f6631---------------------------------------)[](https://medium.com/tag/relationships?source=post_page-----24b2c29f6631---------------------------------------)",1,1763380599.0,u_cotoapp25,0,1.0,False

1oze9wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1oze9wh/when_a_child_has_a_fever_and_the_house_is_cold/,"When a child has a fever, and the house is cold from those who should support: a story about the mother's strength, endurance and boundaries in the family","- All the relatives are coming to us for the summer! - Sergey announced happily, appearing in the kitchen doorway with a phone, as if with a trophy.

I froze with a cup of coffee, which immediately ceased to seem comforting to me.

The first thought: he's joking.

Second: why this summer?

- What kind of relatives? - I asked cautiously, hoping that it was about his parents at most.

Sergei flopped down on the chair opposite, shining like a child who was given a huge Lego box:

- That's it! Mom and dad, Lenka with Kolya and children, Dimka with Alyona and Mishka. Can you imagine? We're all together for a whole month!

If he had sent it to me by voice, I would have left the message unheard. And so I had to depict a smile, more like a nervous tic. A cauldron of hell appeared before my eyes: our house, stuffed with people, queue to the bathroom, mess, loud conversations, children's screams. And my work project, which is about to bring me a promotion - on condition of complete silence.

- When? - I squeezed out.

- Already this Saturday. Parents and Lenka will arrive first. Dimka - a little later. Cool, isn't it?

There were three days left until Saturday.

I quietly got up, went out into the garden with an ""urgent call"" look, and dialed the hotel number:

- Hello, single room for July, please.

That's how the strangest summer of my life began.


Sergey's parents were the first to come. Anna Petrovna immediately declared the kitchen her territory, and Viktor Stepanovich sat down in Sergei's chair, turning on the TV as if he was trying to shout over the plane.

- Irinochka, - Anna Petrovna whispered with a conspiratorial look, staying with me in the kitchen, - we brought a family box. It's time to give it to a worthy heir.

She took out a carved casket, like a shrine.

- It is passed down in our family for four generations, - the mother-in-law solemnly said. - But who will get it is another question.

The fact that this issue will be resolved ""at the end of the summer"", I understood from her meaningful view.

In the evening, Elena was with Nikolai and the twins. The children immediately caused chaos. Elena - as always, with hugs, pies and a suggestion of ""a little housewife in the kitchen"". Nikolai climbed into my office - the only quiet place - and put his things there.

On the third morning, I woke up at five, quietly packed my laptop and documents, left a note about an ""important meeting"" - and went to the hotel.

The hotel room was so quiet that I almost cried with happiness.

When I went down to the restaurant, I saw Dmitry, Sergei's brother. He also looked like he had escaped from prison.

- Just don't tell me you ran away, - he grinned.

- Were you supposed to come in a week?

- We arrived yesterday. I told Alyona that I had a meeting and moved in here.

We looked at each other and realized that we were allies in misfortune.

- A pact of silence? - I asked.

Stepanovich remained at home, although the latter simply did not notice the chaos, immersed in the TV.

And there was also a casket. Every night Anna Petrovna gave speeches about family values, looking at everyone appreciatively, like a judge.



She had a gala dinner on Saturday night. Everyone gathered, even those who had been hiding all day.

While I was setting the table, I heard a scream.

- The casket is missing!

We ran to the guest room. Anna Petrovna stood in the middle of the room, white as a sheet.

- I left it on the dresser! She was here! Someone took it!

- Maybe you postponed it? - Viktor Stepanovich tried to intervene.

- No! - she said. - Some of you decided to profit from the family heritage!

Everyone looked at each other, and I clearly remembered Dmitry, who whispered in the afternoon:

""You know, it would be nice to get together once. Maybe then something will clear up.""

I think he foreshed...

But then there was a loud laugh from behind the doorway.

- Mom, are you serious? - Elena said, appearing on the threshold with the same box in her hands. - I took it in the morning. I wanted to take it to the master for restoration. The loop loosened.

Anna Petrovna blinked.

- So you... didn't you steal it?

- Mom, who did you bring up? - Lena rolled her eyes. - I would at least say.

We looked at each other and laughed together. Even my mother-in-law, after a minute pause, joined in.

And suddenly the truth came out of all corners of the room - who ran where, who why.

Sergei admitted that he himself did not expect such a crowd.

Nikolai called the house ""a communal house of the XXI century"".

Anna Petrovna embarrassedly admitted that she just wanted to ""collect everyone"", but she couldn't stand the noise anymore.

And I...….👉👉[continue here](https://lifestoryforeveryday2.blogspot.com/2025/11/blog-post_59.html)",1,1763380356.0,stories,0,1.0,False

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. Metrik - Awake [Hospital Records]**  
*Recommended if you like: Sub Focus, Grafix, Pendulum*  

We are truly living in a golden age of Dancefloor albums right now. We've had _Andromedik_, _Grafix_, very soon also _Sub Focus_, and this week, none other than **Metrik** joined in as well. So let's take this opportunity to _finally_, after all those years, talk about him!

**1.1. Tom Mundell (1986 - 2006)**  

Born and raised in Surrey's very own Guildford, Tom Mundell, the man behind the anti-imperial alias, took a path you don't see very often. Infused with the musical tastes of his parents, namely 70s/80s synth pop and the likes of _Depeche Mode_, he, too, started falling down the rabbit hole of anything guitar-based, even teaching himself to play the guitar at the mere age of 7 (!) and starting his first band, **Mutris**, while still in his pre-teens. However, _electronic_ music was also starting to take hold of him, and very soon lead to him trading his beloved PlayStation for a cheap pair of belt drive turntables, on which he learned to spin the countless vinyls he bought at the local record store each week - at 12, mind you! Shortly after, at around 13, he already ran his own internet radio show, **Skycast**, from his bedroom, mixing anything from House to Trance to Techno. Perhaps surprisingly, it took one of the regular chatters in the attached IRC chat room sending him a CD full of D&B for Tom to take notice of this our genre (it was around 2000 though, to be fair), but once he was exposed to the futuristic sounds of _Bad Company_, _Dom & Roland_, _TeeBee_ and _LTJ Bukem_, he was _hooked_.

Over the next couple of years, Tom expanded his musical expertise by not just learning to play the keyboard, how to hit a set of drums right, and how to theoretically read and write music, he also got expelled from not just one, but two different schools. Oopsie. To finally get his act together, he downloaded Fruity Loops to git gud at this music production thing, with one explicit goal: Getting into Guildford's _Academy of Contemporary Music_! At the same time, so at age 16, he started going to his very first raves at the legendary _Fabric_, and about a year later, he even organised his own DnB nights in Guildford - which were sadly later shut down by the local council. Eventually, he moved to Brighton to study digital music, in the hopes of creating some of that future funk himself one day.

**1.2. Everybody Get Viper (2006 - 2012)**  

Following his studies, Tom found himself working for a London-based music distribution company, managing social media branding and graphic-slash-web design for _Adam Beyer_ and _Drumcode_. As it became time for him to put his own music out there, he used the expertise acquired during said work to attempt to stand out from the already saturated market, by puting together the absolute _perfect_ Myspace page in 2005-2006 - which actually paid off! One day, an A&R from _Splinter Productions_, Jeremy James Ford, if my Google skills are to be trusted, stumbled upon said online presence and offered him a deal! Around this time, so in 2006, Tom's new **Metrik** project would make the first of many splashes after another on _Collective Records_ and its _elp_ sister imprint, with reworks of _Scotja_'s 'Through The Night' and, more importantly, Jesper Dahlback's _DK8_ banger 'Murder Was The Bass', which lead to remix opportunities for French band _Undergang_, but what truly put him onto the DnB map was 2007 anthem 'Your World' on _Intrinsic_, which absolutely _stormed_ the Beatport download charts and earned itself support from big inspirations like _Bad Company_ and _Pendulum_, and a certain _Futurebound_. 

Ever the talent scout, Brendan of course jumped at the chance to sign a promising talent like Tom, and from 2008 on, Metrik became part of the **Viper** family! Flying into another stratosphere of success, one of the first couple of his singles on the imprint, _Technicolour_, not only made its way onto BBC Radio 1, through support from Zane Lowe, Hugh Stephens, Annie Mac and Colin Murray, it was also used as a sound bed for the station's coverage of _Barack Obama's victory speech_ in 2008. My fellow americans, here's some DnB. 

Anyway. Tom's futuristic approach to sound design and hard-hitting productions would continue ravaging the scene, with EPs like _The Departure_ and _Between Worlds_, a pair of huge collaborations with main man Futurebound, and _True Believer_ with Australian up-and-comers _ShockOne_ & _Phetsta_ being early highlights, but he would also embrace another thing massively: Remixes! From known names like _Camo & Krooked_, _BCee_, _Rockwell_, and _Dirtyphonics_, to absurdly popular ones like _Swedish House Mafia_ or _Eric Prydz_, the Metrik remix tag became absolutely infamous in the early 2010s, and to be honest, stayed that way until this very day. However, one particular tune would stand tall above the rest of the bangers: 2012's **Freefall**, with ShockOne sister _Reija Lee_ providing the iconic vocals. So tall, in fact, that a certain other label simply _had_ to snatch him away (once he randomly bumped into them at a rave).

**1.3. It's A Different Kind Of Hi! Now (2013 - 2019)**  

That's right, in 2013 none other than **Hospital Records** got their hands on him! Launched with the self-titled _Metrik_ EP, a collab with the aforementioned Austrian Atzen, a remix for upcoming album releaser _Sub Focus_, and his very own _BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix_, it's safe to say this first year was already quite a whirlwind, but it had nothing on what would follow. After a short series of large-splashes-causing singles, including _Want My Love_ and its instant classic Club Mix, Tom presented his debut album, **Universal Language**, in September 2014. Amidst another avalanche of rather big remixes for _John B_, _DJ Fresh_, _Martin Garrix_, _DVBSS_ and _Sander van Doorn_, and a kinda-offline _Netsky_ collab ('Cant Speak'), this album was his first, unmissable statement of intent, and was followed by extensive touring across basically the entire world, but album numero two was already on the (Forza) horizon.

Aside from filling the time between LPs with collaborations with _TC_ and Shogun head honcho _Friction_, a remix for _Enter Shikari_, a VIP that made it onto season 4 of _Luther_, and some Hospital compilation one-offs like _Terminus_, Tomo Arigato Mister Mundello was also working _hard_ on this follow-up of his, and in 2016, it smashed onto the scene: **LIFE/THRILLS** was here! Inspired by Japan's eclectic Jazz-Pop movements, and the likes of _The Prodigy_, _The Chemical Brothers_, _Björk_, _Brian Eno_ and many more, he threw out the entire rulebook, and did whatever he wanted to do - resulting in instant anthems like _We Got It_, _Chasing Sunrise_, _Cadence_, and bangers for the ages like _Fatso_. 2017 kept the hype going, with _Tension_, the award-winning _S.P.Y_ remix of _We Got It_, and the truly massive VIP of _Fatso_. Plus, he was appointed resident DJ for _BBC Radio 1_! Chasing pure perfection for the next longer entry into his ever more impressive discography, he continued with one-off after one-off, including my beloved Forza anthem _Dawnbreaker_, blaow banger _Ultrafunk_, remixes for (and with) _Wilkinson_ and _Polar Youth_, and, of course, the omni-present festival banger that's still wreaking havoc today, _Hackers_. In fact, that last one seemed _extra_ crunchy, in a way that could be called... album-worthy.

**1.4. We Are The Ex Machina (2019 - 2025)**  

Having perfected the Dancefloor snare, and with inspirations ranging from the guitar-based sonics of his youth to retro-futuristic projects like Porter Robinson's Y2K throwback _Virtual Self_, Tom finally embarked on the journey towards his third album, **Ex Machina**, in late 2019. Focusing even more on his sci-fi aspirations, both via the visual language, crafted by visual designer Vitaliy Havrylyuk and Tom himself, and the vast, futuristic soundscapes, Ex Machina really did fulfill that desire of his for a ""definitive Metrik album"". However, it was not just indeed ""a pure statement of his sound"" in an instrumental fashion, it was also the first time Tom jumped on the mic himself, solidifying this as a shift in sound unlike any other before it. 

While its launch was slightly undermined by that whole pandemic thing, this global downtime allowed him to directly connect to his fans in an entirely new way in the leadup to the release, via the legendary, crab-filled, beer-cam-featuring, weekly livestreams - I still miss them sometimes. Especially the [Virtual Album Launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCCXGihNOX4) he did a day before the LP fully released is a memory I cherish deeply. Even five plus years on, anthems like _We Are The Energy_, _Gravity_, and _Parallel_ with compadre _Grafix_ are still widely considered some of his finest works, and _will_ cause sing-alongs no matter where you play them - no wonder he won that Best Producer award that year.

With 'Utopia' on Forza Horizon 5, VIPs for 'Parallel' and 'Cadence', collaborations with _Grafix_ and _Sub Focus_, whose 'X-Ray' he also remixed, and an entire A/V show for the album, most notably performed at _Rampage_'s _Renegade_ edition in 2022, he kept rightfully riding the Ex Machina hype train afterwards, but what about all the other stuff in between and after? Well, let's get to talking about that. Let's talk about album four, **Awake**.

**1.5. Awake**

Emerging from a nebula of sci-fi atmospheres, opener and title track **Awake**, a collaboration with Blanke's **ÆON:MODE** project, is not just a classic return to sonic form for Metrik, with guitar-infused basslines, catchy leads, and more than just punchy drums, it also represents Tom figuring out what he wants to achieve with his music, by allowing himself to open up and writing about way more personal topics and themes amidst the grandiose arrangements. Similarly bratty, **Immortal** takes one short look at continuing down the road of safe, cookie-cutter bangers, and throws the whole idea out with a swift ""no I'm not gonna die (inside) like that today"". As soon as he utters this refusal of conformity, overwhelmingly large wobbly walls of bass enter the arena, which become the star in a showdown between said utterly obliterating sirens stuttering their way upwards and only brief relief in the form of a bassline response - this refusal is a violent one, and the tune is an all-timer.

Further embracing these personal feelings of his, **Hole** takes us deep down to the chasm Tom found himself in during the intense burnout he suffered recently. Unable to keep steady the tremendous balancing act that is life as a touring artist, with ADHD no less, the literal Tom needed a hiatus to get back on his feet, but the lyrical Tom has someone else helping him out: **Rou Reynold** of _Enter Shikari_, with the help of songwriter-producer **Filthy Pig**, violently pulls him out of the melancholy and into some of the most rock-infused, heaviest-hitting, and somehow also catchiest arrangements so far. Absolute banger. On the other side of the energy spectrum, **Setting Sun** captures Tom's confusing feelings of grief and letting go with a _gorgeous_ vocal synth singing a soothing lullaby on top of darkly rumbling, but also heartwarming bass waves, while he softly expresses his sorrows with some of his loveliest vocals yet. Fun fact, this was written with UK songwriter _Georgia Meek_, who you might recognise from the Andromedik breakdown! 

Jumping back in time quite a bit, we become witnesses to Tom warning himself of overworking, on **Fall To The Dust**. Realising he should take things slowly instead of plowing full steam ahead, or he would end up sleeping the day away, this one is surprisingly self-aware considering what we know about his hiatus now! Production-wise, we're fittingly treated with a relentlessly _pounding_ bassline putting all sorts of pressures on our ears, while high-pitched synths screech the day away - all of it surrounded by rather ominous atmospheres. Why didn't he just listen to himself? Well, **Synchronise** might have an answer to this. According to interviews specifically about his struggles with ADHD, from fitting in (""synchronising"") to trying to get ""the chaos"" inside his mind under control, this one goes deeper than just being a banger - but oh boy is it also a banger! Going from gentle guitaristic rhythms joined by distant, melancholic flutes towards the already iconic whomp-whomp melody, we are thrown right into the chaos, with the lead, well, _synchronised_ with the guitar riffs to incredible effect, while his stuttery 8th note basslines fill out the rest. Top top top.

Quite literally dealing with the feelings he went through during his, at the time, unexplained absence after last year's ""album launch"" at Outernet, **Disconnection** takes us down a more somber route, with minimalistic guitar plucking, and generally less full-on dancey and a more rolling, melodic approach to a drop, while Tom depicts the anxiety-induced paralysis he found himself in, through one of his cleanest vocal performances yet. After all this beautiful pondering, we find release in the most absurd of tunes on this album, **Simulation**. Initially composed on a flight to play in Braunschweig's infamous Brain Klub (I know because I was there!), this one takes _zero_ prisoners: distortion blowing out entire soundsystems, a bassline taken to its extreme, relentlessly ticking 8ths thrown on top - this one's _huge_.

With our ears now firmly tinnitus-ed, let's sit back and relax with another throwback: **Overdrive**! You know this one. **Grafix** feature, came out shortly after _Ex Machina_, revels in its use of their collaborative trademark Linkin Park-esque scratches and Tony Hawk's skater vibes, with lyrics reminiscent of lockdown times, and a drop pitting ultraviolent knocks on your mental door against incomprehensibly large synths! A tad newer, however, is **Abyss**. Written together with _Cameron Warren_, this one takes the profound loss he was dealing with on _Setting Sun_ head-on. With Tom employing all sorts of _heavily_ metal-inspired 8th-note riffs, wildly distorted synth leads, hypnotically whispery breakdowns (both mentally and sonically), and larger-than-life background vocals, we are fully riding into battle against the demons that have been haunting him, and finding cathartic energy in the sadness of it all.

One last time, we delve into the stasis Tom found himself in, on **Alive**. Written with prolific Dutch singer-songwriter _Jantine Heij_, this one focuses more on the desperate urge to return to normality, to finally feeling alive again, but once he approaches some sense of alivelihood, he is thrown through a multi-layered drop of lasers, semi-squelchy basslines, uplifting synths and chuggy basslines - a journey of self-discovery, and a bit of a banger, I must admit. Lastly, we let things roll out, with second **Grafix** feature and album closer **Waves**. Distinctly more optimistic and life-affirming than its predecessors, with the titular waves crashing onto our mental shores and an assortment of acoustic and surf-y guitars forming a rather picturesque scenery, Tom's vocals taking us beyond the stratosphere of beauty, and a melody that is simply _gorgeous_, this one is special, and despite the stylistic differences, an incredible fitting end to this personal saga.

**1.6. Conclusion**

While sonically mostly a straight continuation of what we were introduced to in _Ex Machina_, **Awake** sees Metrik opening up in ways he's never done before. Exploring his own, raw experiences with loss, burnout, and ADHD, this one seeks to find happiness through the catharsis that comes with the all-around heavier approach he's taking on here. Produced as masterfully as ever, but with an added focus on the wonderful songwriting, performed more fantastic than ever. Welcome back, Tom.

I was holding a cup of coffee and trying to look calm and normal. My crush walked by and said “Hey,” and for some reason my brain froze. I tried to say “Hey” back, but instead I panicked, waved too hard and ..... spilled my coffee all over myself.

Not a little spill. Like a full blown spill and messed my clothes too.

My crush looked surprised, I pretended I was totally fine and then I walked away like a sad, soggy donut.

I had the first-generation-type Brikka with the weight used to build up pressure, and I had that working pretty well until it fell onto the floor and the handle + mounting point for the handle broke.

  
Anyway I have the modern style of Brikka now, and I'm finding things different. I used to try to ""quench"" the pot from passing too much hot air through the coffee at the end (which would create bitterness) but now find that the extraction continues for longer after I do that - but maybe I shouldn't even do that with this pot?

  
The other thing is that while there isn't much liquid left at the bottom of the reservoir, the grounds are still pretty wet. And the coffee does not taste as good as it should. Suggestions? 

(I'm using the ""use boiled water to the reservoir to reduce the time the pot sits on the element"" method, but no paper filter.)",1,1763380256.0,mokapot,2,0.67,False

Especially when it comes to fruit trees and bushes. And I think having them be region-locked would add more reason for the player to have multiple bases in different biomes, as well as gives the teleporter more function. 

Examples;

Grasslands; Typical stuff, add more berry bush species, plums, pears, peaches etc. 

Autumn/Fall Area; Could do more species of mushrooms; turkey tails on trees or fallen logs, maitake, morels, toadstools, lumps on the ground for truffles that you could dig with shovel, or have a pig on a leash, and it could auto-dig it up.

Desert Area; Lotus blossoms in desert lakes/ponds. Dustballs or wickerballs whatever they are called. 

New tropical/island area; guava, passionfruit, mango, Breadfruit, Snakefruit, Coffee Plant, Kiwano Melon, Starfruit, etc

It could even go further as there are so many cool looking fruits and even vegetables that are both real and would be aesthetically pleasing for players

1oze8gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1oze8gm/hii_nervous_newly_diagnosed_as_pvc/,Hii nervous newly diagnosed as PVC,"
I’m 29 female. Been having these “attacks” since I was 19, used to be 2 years apart but I had a huge thing at work last week and drank at least 2 cups of coffee per day for like a week then boom! Past 3 days the palpitations got worse and it caused me to become so anxious (and I’ve had panic attacks before) to the point that breathing felt difficult.

It was 72 hours of “I’m dying?” with the occasional “rest zone” with no palpitations that lasted for maybe 15-30minutes.

Decided to see a cardiologist today, did ECG and was told I had PVC. I’ve had ECG done 2 years ago with similar finding but they thought it was ectopic. Echo was normal, perfect. They’ve ruled out other causes such as hyperthyroid. 

I’m wearing a holter now. They’re planning to start me on bisoprolol after they review the holter. 

Also I think its about time I seek professional treatment for my anxiety disorder as these palpitations only occur when I’m stressed.

What am I supposed to expect from having PVC. I’m turning 30 next year and it sucks that I have this condition. Doesnt help that  I overthink everything.

However, I'm very anxious to tell my colleagues. We are small team of 10, half working from home and half from the office. I'm in the office.

We never have meetings all together, we usually do one on one when necceserry. Although they are all nice and friendly we don't eat lunch or have coffee together which means we don't talk to each other often. 

I don't mind saying I'm pregnant, the main problem is that I don't get many opportunities to say it. I can't just randomly go to people and say I'm pregnant. They are also mostly older men so it kinda feels weird.

The only idea I had so far was to bring cookies and send group email. But I still feel very anxious, how will they react? Will I have to answer to many questions, etc? It's really paralyzing.

1oze6p7,https://i.redd.it/pznnu6782t1g1.jpeg,Post-Dispatch Depression – How Could Season 2 Play Out???,"Alright everybody listen..… I’m officially in PDD, as I call it, which means Post-Dispatch Depression obv, and I need backup, help everyoneee 🚨😭. I literally cannot stop thinking about this game. It has taken full custody of my brain. Please send thoughts, prayers, and maybe a restraining order against myself I am getting dangerous and desperate lol, I just cant 😭🙏.

So, confession time. I see that many of you, well most of you, romanced Visi. Or it's the fact that Invisigal propaganda goes crazy and that's the reason I am only seeing that. Well even though I didn’t romance Courtney (don’t cancel me pls 🙏), I did turn her into a full-on hero, and honestly?? Peak storytelling. Peak character arc. Peak ending. Peak everything! But yeah, I romanced Mandy because… obviously. Blonde Blazer supremacy 💅🔥.

Here’s the thing though. I replayed Dispatch four times from last Wednesday, when the last 2 episodes came out, to Sunday. Yeah. Four entire runs. Four emotional breakdowns. I collected almost every ending, tested every choice, yelled at my screen and cried every time Chase sacrificed himself for Visi (even though I knew he would end up fine 😭), and yet… I WANT MORE. This game is pure dopamine.... PEAK FICTION!!!!

Now I’m out here budgeting like a responsible adult just to buy the extra deluxe stuff, the comics and whatever else is included idk, I crave for anything that gives me more Dispatch content basically. I need these characters injected directly into my bloodstream 🙏😭.

All of this is cool and all that, but then the real depression hits: Season 2 might never happen. YEAH YOU HEARD IT FIRST HERE!!! And honestly? I get it. The branching endings are WILD. The game basically explodes into a spiderweb of possibilities depending on whether you kicked Sonar/Coupe and if you forgave them, who you romanced, whether Waterboy/Phenomenam joined Z-Team permanently, whether you kicked Visi or you kept her on the team, whether she turned into a villian or a hero, etc, etc. Literally the choices and possibilities seemed endless.

And still after all that… I think  it’s not impossible. The way I imagine Season 2 working is:
First,  you start the game and get to pick one of all the S1 endings, even the ones you didn’t personally get, just as the base for the season 2 story to unfold. I mean whatever ending you pick, not a lot would change, just some interactions, some romance scenes, which characters are in the frame, we already seen it happen in some scenes in season 1, it just will have to be a tad bit more complex ( a lot more complex actually I am just delusional 🙏🥀 ). It’s doable. Just not easy. And definitely not guaranteed 😩.

Also almost forgot, the other big mystery:
Should Season 2 be a whole new standalone game, or should it be a DLC expansion that plugs into your existing S1 save file so your choices carry over? If they go the DLC route,  it might be better, they could make  us  replay Season 1 to establish our choices properly, so the second season continues after that. So they could force us replay the first season, which honestly… I’d do anyway. Happily. With snacks 😂. Well it will be also needed to remember the story again so... It's a win-win. Or they could just make as pick the ending we want as I mentioned before.

Honestly, there are so many ways this could be handled, and all of them require effort, dark magic, and maybe three gallons of coffee. But even if it seems unlikely, I’m praying and even though it will be difficult, may the odds be ever in our favor 🙏🥀.

Until then… send help. Or more Dispatch theories. Or Dispatch fanfic. Or whatever Dispatch honestly. Either works. And of course I can't wait to hear all your opinions and thoughts on the stuff I talked abt!!!

My definition of 100% solo compatible is that a single player can make use of all weapons on board. Either through NPC crew or automated turrets. And the ability to do emergency in-flight damage control from the cockpit to keep things from exploding because the goddamn coffee machine is on the fritz. 

For me, i think a great cutoff point would be ships of a size similar to the player ships from Star Wars - The Old Republic, which would roughly be medium ships in SC. Perhaps a few advanced large ships that are highly automated and advanced in design such as the 600i.

The *Hokule’a* passed its shakedown flight without issue. Made the loop in about an hour, which was a perfectly reasonable length of time for 700 kilometers of flight in atmosphere. All the systems checked out just fine, though they were running the captured telemetry through the main computer system just to make sure there weren’t any oddities hiding somewhere.

Alex was doing a little less well.

Sure, he had done the flight by hand with only a few warnings from the ATC system - ones he had ultimately set off on purpose - and parked it manually with zero issues. But that conversation with the Lieutenant was lingering in his mind. He replayed it again for himself, jaw working as he performed the post-test inspection on the shuttle and silently tried to will Carbon to come over and ask how things went, without an entourage.

He had tried checking in with the group shortly after he had landed but they were deep in the process of inspecting the drone. Their mission had shifted a bit - being made for exploration where you didn’t necessarily want to send living people meant its systems had been hardened against radiation way more than the *Hokule’a* was, and radiation in its various forms were how scans were taken. So there were large portions that couldn’t be scanned without radiation sources that were much more powerful than they had on hand.

So when Alex and Williams returned, Carbon and Zheng were both halfway in the drone, manually inspecting the areas they had removed a whole bunch of plating to get into.

This was clearly interfering with his mental signaling to Carbon to come talk to him. Privately. Not that he believed in such things, but it was better than second guessing everything he had spilled to Williams, again. Alex was still pretty sure that he hadn’t done too bad. Just stuff that was generally well known among both the Humans and Tsla’o.

*Probably*.

He had his head stuck into the Ground Support Panel, a holdover from a long time ago that he had been trained to use anyway. He poked the sensor pen from the tablet into an audio connector, the box next to the item in the list filled in with a checkmark. Plug in power and comms, if you could believe it. Sure, it was important if you had a reactorless ship or had to do a black start on the reactor, or on the very slim chance you were taking off from an airport that hadn’t been upgraded in a couple of centuries and the ground crew had to put on wired headphones on to talk to the pilot.

He still hadn’t needed to use any of the functions that were in there, but he’d only been flying for a bit over a decade. There was still time.

Alex checked off the GSP manually and latched the door closed just in time to hear the distinct sound of Tsla’o footsteps approaching. Yes, he got his hopes up. He had successfully communicated to Carbon using fully contactless telepathy that no Human had ever shown the ability to...

Oh, it was just Amalu.

“Alex? Do you have a moment?” Amalu asked, quietly and almost timidly, as he stood next to Alex and watched him prod a pitot tube with the sensor pen.

He nodded, a little curious as to where this was going. Alex had a suspicion already, particularly considering the last thing Amalu had sought him out specifically to ask about. “Yeah, I reckon as long as you don’t mind me working while we talk. About half done with this thing and I want to get it done before dinner.”

“Oh, that is perfectly fine.” Amalu had managed to also sound nervous now as he stared at the pitot tube with deadly intensity, as though he was also working on the shuttle as well. “I have some questions that I want to ask a Human but do not necessarily trust Crenshaw to answer truthfully... I am sure he will eventually but there will be a span where he is - what is the phrase, giving me trouble?”

“Yeah that’s Crenshaw for you.” Alex nodded in agreement. Crenshaw just had that feel to him, he’d take jokes too far and just not treat things as seriously as someone else would, at least when he wasn’t on the clock. Alex had known a couple of those guys over the years. “Could always ask Abbot or Williams... Or Zheng.”

That little choking noise that Amalu made when suggested asking Zheng cemented what this was about in Alex’s mind.

“I would... I would like to ask someone that I know is...” Amalu hummed almost silently, stopping himself before he said something that he was not supposed to. “That I know has some experience with Human women. In a nonprofessional setting.”

“Ask Williams. She’s got loads of experience actually being a woman in a nonprofessional setting. That’s a Marines joke.” Alex said, ushering Amalu a step over as he slid the sensor pen over the forward starboard comm antenna, pausing for a moment to give the short Tsla’o a little smirk and a wink. “Now that I’m done giving you trouble, what’s your question? Or questions? I can’t say I’ve had a lot of luck with Human women in a nonprofessional setting in my past, but that’s been on me.”

A spectrum of emotions washed over Amalu as he recovered from that. Annoyed, surprised, a bit mad, then simply unsure. “Well... I was wondering how Humans signal that they’re interested in entering into a relationship that is more personal.”

“When you say personal...” Alex checked his tablet, moving on to the forward starboard sensor cluster. “Do you mean friendly or romantic?” 

This question was enough to factory reset Amalu, which was not a great sign. His silver eyes widened, antenna and ears both raised in alarm. “I- I, ah. I- I think-”

Romantic. “Out with it man, you have to know your own intentions in life.” There was no other possible answer here other than romantic. Alex didn’t think it would really change the approach very much, but that much stammering could only lead down one path.

“I think romantic, yes.” The gray furred male exhaled hard and smoothed out his face, practically forcing his antenna back down, ears popping back up after he tried to get them under control, too.

Alex fought the urge to advise him to just shoot his shot. It would have amused him to no end to do so, simply because Amalu’s reaction to inane, Human specific advice would be funny. That smirk came back as he enjoyed the thought but set it aside, finishing the starboard side check and moving on to the nose cone area. “Okay. Walk me through how you’d do that for a Tsla’o.”

“Oh, well, first I’d get a kerchief and tie it around my wrist so that she knows...” He petered out, a little confused at the face Alex was making. “What does that look mean?”

He hadn’t really intended to be giving Amalu so much side eye, not such an incredulous glance towards the younger Tsla’o. But he was. He absolutely was. “A *kerchief*?”

Amalu nodded, painfully earnest as always. “Yes. I had noticed that Humans have them, Karras wears one on his head regularly. I assume he is not seeking a relationship of any sort, given it seems to be more decorative.” 

“Oh, like a bandana. Ok, that’s... Better than what I was imagining.” He had gone straight to handkerchief, which, of the two, he assumed would be best kept in the pocket where no one would see it after having blown your nose in it. Tsla’o have plenty of nose, so it stood to reason that they had handkerchiefs, at some point. “So you would use that to signal interest in someone... somehow?”

“One might wear it openly to signal that they are considering pursuing a relationship. The color and even the fold can communicate information about what one is seeking... or if you are interested in a specific person you would keep it hidden in your sleeve until you are talking to that person.” Amalu was relaxing, slowly, as he described this process. “Optimally they would see you reveal it and understand the intent.”

Alex pondered that whole operation as he swept the sensor over the bottom of the windshield. “That seems... Very luck based.” How had they managed to maintain a population? Maybe Alex was missing something here, maybe the Tsla’o were socialized to be more mindful of such things. Alex was sure he would require a slightly... a much more blunt approach to catch someone’s romantic interest than a scrap of cloth sticking out of their sleeve.

This information also left him scrambling to see if he could recall anybody flaunting a kerchief at him and having that sail safety over his head. He assumed not, but you never know. Maybe being a prince made you a hot commodity even with the proximity to The Butcher and her niece that he was married to, before you even counted the whole ‘other species’ thing.

“That is not the only way. But it is the first path one walks.” He said, starting to gesture as he spoke. “It is very informal but a denial or acceptance at that step should be considered a closed matter for some time, at least a year. Obviously if one attempts to court someone via their family, a denial is much more permanent.”

“Well yeah, of course.” Ok, going through someone’s family felt slightly more direct, and more harrowing depending on the family. “So... Given that a Human is not going to pick up on that kerchief thing unless you sit them down and tell them about it while putting it on, you’re probably going to have to be the one that takes the step over the divide. I’d recommend being more direct.”

“How direct?”

“You walk up to them and look them in the eye and say something like: hey, would you like to go out with me? You can ask if they’d want to go out for coffee or tea. Whatever, just to make the offer a little more specific so the imagination doesn’t run wild... That’s gonna be hard here, we don’t have a coffee shop or anything, and very little privacy.” Alex tapped the nose cone check as complete and moved on to the port checks. He could already hear Karras yelling encouragement across the mess hall. “I get the feeling that is very much not a Tsla’o way of doing things, but it’ll make your interest plain.”

Amalu was not reacting well to any of this. “I do not know if that is something I can do.”

“Bro.” Alex paused his inspection and looked at Amalu with a critical frown. “You joined the military and have willingly walked onto an alien dyson sphere we know nothing about via a portal device that should not be able to work by our current understanding of physics. This was fantasy until a dozen weeks ago, and yet here you stand. Putting yourself out there sucks, it can hurt, but I know you can do it.”

“I had not thought of it like that.” He stood up a little straighter and nodded, looking up at Alex with a touch of resolution in his eyes... for a moment. “Is there... Is there a way to judge a Human’s interest in you *before* doing that?”

Alex glanced over his shoulder at the drone, both Carbon and Zheng still at work in it. “Ok - just so I’m not guessing anymore, it’s Zheng, right?”

Amalu followed suit, making sure he was not being watched before nodding vigorously.

He had just the thing for this instance. “Alright. So remember yesterday afternoon when she was spinning tracks... Playing music for you three?”

“Oh yes.” The reply came instantly. “I do.”

Not a big surprise there. “And she was sitting right next to you despite there being enough room that physical contact wasn’t necessary?”

His ears shifted down and outward slightly as he glanced away, a move Alex was familiar with enough to read as a blush without thinking about it. “It- I- Yes. She was.”

“Did she lean on you?” Alex moved down the port side of the shuttle faster than the starboard, there were just fewer things to scan on this side. He was still mindful of their proximity to the person being discussed, keeping his voice low. “For that matter, has she touched you, maybe your arm or hand, for no professional reasons you could discern?”

Amalu’s eyes widened. “I had been warned that humans were just more inclined to initiate physical contact than Tsla’o are, so I took that to mean that... That was just what she did.”

Alex hummed and shook his head. He hadn’t seen Zheng get chummy with anybody, not like that. Except maybe Carbon. Huh. “Look, it’s not a guarantee. Some people are more touchy than others, but I haven’t seen her do that to anyone else. I think she’s been pretty reserved, actually.”

He took a really deep breath here, exhaling slowly as he got his ears back in order again. “So you believe that she has been displaying interest in me?”

Alex closed his eyes for a moment. Amalu was new to this. He wouldn’t get annoyed at the younger Tsla’o for being overly cautious when he was out of the loop on how Humans signaled interest in others with nonverbal cues. It was perfectly reasonable to be careful in that situation and not just get a little drunk and then kiss somebody. “Yeah, I think so.”

If I ask something like: 'Where’s the best specialty coffee near San Antonio with pour-over and Wi-Fi?' Gemini gives a list of cafés, but we’re never there (even though in regular Google Search and Maps we show up just fine).

We’ve already invested in the basics: our Google Business Profile is complete with reviews and a menu; our website is optimized with local keywords; we’re in relevant local directories; and we’re pretty active on social. So at this point, I’m wondering if we’re doing the right things for Google Search but not necessarily for Google’s AI.

What I’m trying to figure out is whether there’s anything specific we should be doing to improve visibility in Gemini answers. Has anyone seen success with optimizing content so AI assistants actually reference your business? And are there any tools that work like a Gemini tracker to show when a business appears in Gemini’s responses? Even a simple Gemini tracking setup or process would help - just something to measure whether changes we make are working.

I’m not trying to be sneaky or manipulative. I just want to show up when someone nearby asks where to grab a good coffee with Wi-Fi. If anyone here has worked on local visibility inside AI assistants, I’d really love to hear what you’ve learned.",8,1763378940.0,GoogleGeminiAI,3,1.0,False

the food is stupid good. everything tastes fresh, everything feels premium, even the way they package stuff looks like they actually care. the workers legit give a damn. whoever their pastry chef is, give that person a raise immediately, because those oreo square things are unreal. like criminally good.

the whole vibe in there is perfect. the design is cute, the coffee hits at a starbucks level or honestly better imo, and the baristas are always friendly even when the place is slammed. they even have their own app and it actually works, i usually order on there so i don’t have to stand in line like a lost soul when it’s packed.

my only complaint is the hours. respectfully please open from like 5am to 9pm. i swear people would come early for coffee and later after class to sit and do work. 

also i’m still shocked the second location didn’t take off. personally i think it should’ve been farther away from the original spot. somewhere like tullys plaza or really anything like a mile away so it wasn’t competing with itself lol.

anyway, strange brew is cute, it’s consistent, the food slaps, the coffee slaps, the staff slaps (in a good way), and it’s one of the few places downtown that feels genuinely well run. easy 10 out of 10.

I’m 19M and I broke up with my girlfriend about 2 weeks ago. Before we split, I stayed twice at a friend’s place in another city, and I ended up hanging out a lot with her roommate (19F). I’ll call her L.

While I was still in the relationship, L and I had a really good vibe. We laughed a lot and it felt like we held eye contact way more than you usually do with someone you barely know. I can’t tell if I’m imagining it or if she was kind of into me but staying respectful because I was taken.

Some examples:
When we were eating sushi, I looked at a piece and she picked that exact one. We smiled at each other for a moment and she joked about it. On a walk, my friend got pulled into an online meeting, so it was mostly me and L talking. She kept the conversation going, even asking small random questions that felt like she just wanted to keep talking to me. She came with me for a smoke even though she didn’t plan to. At the club, I turned her around by her shoulders to help her get to the DJ booth—she didn’t react weirdly or anything. And after I offered her a sip of my drink once, she casually took more throughout the night. Nothing crazy on its own, but the vibe felt different.

The confusing part is my friend (her roommate) told me L is just “really nice” and that she hasn’t heard her say anything about liking me. But at the same time, would she really tell me if her roommate liked her friend’s boyfriend at the time? It feels like that’s something a girl would keep to herself out of respect.

Now I’m single, and I’m seeing them again soon. I kind of want to ask L out for coffee while I’m there. Nothing intense, just a casual “hey, wanna go for coffee?” kind of thing.

So I guess my questions are:
Is it weird to ask someone out only 2 weeks after a breakup?
Does her behavior sound flirty or just friendly?
And is it better to just wait and ask her in person instead of messaging before I arrive?

I’m not trying to jump into a serious relationship. I just felt a connection and don’t want to misread the whole thing.

Would appreciate any thoughts.

edit: something i forgot to mention which might be a sign, earlier when i first met her, she complained about how useless her ex was and whatever, and when i saw her a month and a half later i made those same jokes to her, and she seemed surprised that i paid attention and remembered what she said, pointing it out herself in a flirty way maybe saying something like “oh you remember everything i say to you huh”",1,1763378336.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

1ozdn6k,https://i.redd.it/tcg8cf2iqs1g1.jpeg,A fallen soldier 🫡,"Ever since I got into indie fragrances, especially oils (actually wanting to figure out what I like in fragrances, as I'd been receiving and buying ""mainstream"" frags for a while and never being really attached to any of them), I've been on a no-buy (well, low, I bought some Lush I actually liked) of alcohol-based fragrances to try to start emptying my collection out. I've been doing the same to most makeup except for what I actually use up (mascara, eyebrows).

These are all the VS body sprays I have left. I realize they (at least these) have basically no longevity - except for clothes, where I can't actually smell them after a while but other people tell me their clothes faintly smelled like mine after hugging me etc. So inspired by that, I got the idea of using up these mists not only for the gym and errands, but more liberally as bedsheet scents and generously on my clothes, regardless of what oil I was wearing on my skin. And it's been working out pretty well! I finished 2 VS sprays before this I didn't think of posting (Sparkling Crème and Flower Sorbet). I also have: 

2 more body sprays, but which I actually actively like (1 Lush, 1 Sol de Janeiro)

2 Eau de Toilettes (Spanish supermarket brand)

3 Lush Eau de Parfums which I like a lot

4 Eau de Parfums I am ""eh sure, it's fine"" about (1 Gucci Flora, 1 Jean Paul Gaultier, 1 Rituals, Flower Knows)

The rest are all indies - several non-alcohol EdP, and oils. I'm using up the VS body sprays as I described, and after that might go for the EdTs. The Gucci Flora and Rituals I pack for business trips because they're dumb reaches, the JPG I guess I can use for ""fancy"" occasions (though I like the Lush-es more, but they are quite potent), the Flower Knows is a shockingly strong citrus and Pink Pepper that I guess I'll have a crack at next summer. 

My ideal will be to only keep EdPs I actively enjoy (like the Lush - Lust, Turmeric Latte and Chelsea Morning. I'm thinking of adding more because I do enjoy their collection a lotbut again: low-/no-buy), and one or two EdTs/body sprays for everyday, errands, etc. Otherwise I am very happy with my indies.

As for these scents' reviews: **Private Sundeck (Tonka, pineapple, citrus)** was pretty nice, actually. The description makes it sound very tropical but it's actually a sweet and powdery vanilla with fairly juicy pineapple. I think it made my clothes smell pretty nice! Next on the chopping block is **Sunrise Waves (orange blossom, bergamot, amber)** and it's honestly giving me absolutely nothing. It's just plain and even fainter than Private Sundeck? It's kind of slightly orange blossomy I guess? (As for the older ones: **Flower Sorbet (sugar, peony, blackcurrant)** was a floral, too-sugary juicy blackcurrant, stronger and sweeter than Private Sundeck. I liked **Mallow Crème (marshmallow, gardenia, coconut)** a lot more, a sweet powdery lactonic. Very synthetic of course but it's VS. From the Private Suneck collection I wish I'd gotten the discontinued Poolside Service (gardenia, terry cloth, papaya). The terry cloth note seemed controversial but something I might be into.

As for the other 2: **Amaretto Fizz (almond coffee, orange blossom)** goes a bit into VS plain, synthetic territory but has more character than Sunrise Waves, the almond coffee note is quite apparent and caramel-y. I like it fine. **Cedar Breeze (rosemary, cedar, salty coast)** is a bit of a standout, pretty different from VS's usual synthetic sweetness. It's clean, woody, calming, and bit of aromatics. The rosemary feels like it's including the trunk and branches of the rosemary bush rather than just the fresher leaves. Quite unisex, almost like a room scent. Smells exactly like something I want to spray on my clothes right out of the washing machine. A bit of spa vibes, it's nice if boring.",5,1763378155.0,PanPorn,0,1.0,False
1ozdn0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ceednidniftuceedexam/comments/1ozdn0i/the_biggest_mistake_ceeduceed_aspirants_make_and/,The Biggest Mistake CEED/UCEED Aspirants Make (And How to Fix It),"Here's a fresh Reddit post promoting the GK book:

The Biggest Mistake CEED/UCEED Aspirants Make (And How to Fix It)

Let's be honest—most of us obsess over sketching, design thinking, and spatial reasoning while preparing for CEED/UCEED. We spend hours perfecting our drawing skills and solving logical reasoning puzzles. But here's the harsh truth: neglecting General Knowledge is the silent killer that tanks your Part A score. 
�I've seen so many talented designers lose out on their dream colleges not because they couldn't sketch or think creatively, but because they underestimated the GK section. According to recent preparation analysis, candidates who ignore basic GK topics often lose 30-40% of their Part A marks—that's a massive chunk you can't afford to lose. 
�Why GK Gets Ignored (And Why That's a Problem)Most aspirants assume they ""already know"" general knowledge or plan to ""cover it later."" Big mistake. 
CEED/UCEED GK isn't just random trivia—it's deeply connected to design culture: ��Art movements and their impact on modern design

Famous designers, architects, and their philosophiesAwards (Padma, Nobel, design-specific recognition)Indian heritage, crafts, and cultural knowledgeEnvironmental sustainability and green designLogo evolution and brand recognition
Current affairs relevant to design and innovationYou can't cram this in the last week. It requires consistent, structured learning.The Resource Problem

Here's another issue: scattered resources. You're jumping between Wikipedia, random PDFs, YouTube videos, and blogs. There's no structure, no exam focus, and honestly, no time to curate everything yourself when you're also juggling sketching practice, mock tests, and Part B prep. 
�What Actually WorksI'm speaking from experience here. What saved me was finding a single, comprehensive GK resource specifically tailored for design entrance exams. Not generic GK books meant for civil services or school exams—something built for CEED, UCEED, NID, and NIFT aspirants.The Design Mocktail 400+ page GK Book covers everything systematically:
✅ Art History & Design Movements
✅ Famous Designers, Architects & Design Legends
✅ Indian & World Heritage, Crafts, Festivals
✅ Fashion Industry, Trends, Fashion Weeks
✅ Awards & Recognition (Padma, Nobel, Design Awards)
✅ Science, Technology & Innovation
✅ Geography, Polity & Government Schemes
✅ Sports, Personalities & Current Affairs
✅ Language, Literature & Literary Movements
✅ Environment, Sustainability & Green Building
✅ Logo & Brand Recognition (Automotive, Tech, Fashion)
✅ Daily Preparation Strategies & Reading SourcesIt's visual, structured, and exam-focused. 

No fluff. No wasted time. Just the knowledge you need to ace Part A.

Why This Book Specifically?
Saves Time: Everything in one place. No more hunting for resources.Exam-Relevant: Curated specifically for CEED/UCEED/NID/NIFT—not generic GK.
Visual Learning: Illustrations and visual aids make retention faster.
Community Access: You get access to the Design Mocktail community for doubt-solving and last-minute tips.Lifetime Updates: New editions and updates included—useful if you're attempting next year too.At ₹259, it's literally the cost of two coffees. Compare that to the months of research and scattered learning it replaces.

Final Thought
Don't let GK be your weak link. The students who score high aren't necessarily the best sketchers—they're the ones who prepare smartly across all sections. Build your foundation now, not in the last week.To everyone grinding for CEED 2026 (January 19, 2026)—you've got 2 months. Use them wisely. ��Good luck!

Does her behavior sound flirty or just friendly?
And is it better to just wait and ask her in person instead of messaging before I arrive?

I’m not trying to jump into a serious relationship. I just felt a connection and don’t want to misread the whole thing.

Well I used to go about life thinking solitary life isn’t so bad. Surely I’d be okay being mostly alone? Don’t get me wrong - I have family, really good friends that I can rely on but it gets so lonely at times with no one to text or call to just chat about the mundanes of life. 

I was traveling recently and though I wasn’t alone and I had fun, there was no one to share my travel updates with. It so happened that I was listening to Olivia Dean’s Baby Steps and this song really resonated with me, especially the lines of there’s no one to text when the plan lands or to call when the plane’s taking off. It just got me thinking how lonely my life is at the moment.

I’m not much of a social butterfly - friendly when approached but scary when not (grumpy cat, anyone?) so I thought maybe I can try online? 

Anyhoo, a few bits about me: Unlike the majority of Reddit, I don’t play games though I own a Switch (that is honestly collecting dust at the moment. Impulse purchase woohoo!). I listen to music and podcast a fair bit, mostly while working. I have started to tap into my creative side by dabbling in some water colour arts (they’re more like abstract blobs than masterpieces ngl). I prefer brunch to lunch, tea over coffee (though I can never say no to a Flat White), waking up early on Saturdays to run errands, sleeping in/ bed rotting on Sundays and playing the occasional board/ card games with my friends. 

Come say hello if you’re keen or if not - all the very best out there!

She's had mammary tumors under some of her nipples for a while, but one in particular is worrying me. The tumor is the size of a small grape/cherry and the nipple has had discharge/fluid leakage for years now. Mostly only comes out when handled, but sometimes is seems to ooze out on its own, I keep her fur constantly shaved around that nipple because of the sticky mess. The discharge is mostly a shade of watery brown, sometimes almost clear with just a hint of brownish, sometimes darker, like watery coffee. But a couple of times lately it's been pure blood, doesn't even seem watered down or anything, just pure, red, fresh blood. And it shoots out, super-thin, just barely visible, but high pressured, like poking a hole in a water balloon. It wouldn't surprise me if reached a meter away. It goes back to normal brownish in a day though. 

I've taken her to a vet of course, but they said to wait and see if it gets worse, if it starts to grow rapidly, if she's in pain, etc. But my greatest fear is that I wait until she's in pain, only to hear that now she's too old for surgery and I'll have to have her put down so she doesn't suffer. The vet I went to seemed to think she's already too old, but I'm worried that they just see a big dog that's almost 13 and think that she's practically ancient, but tibetan mastiffs regularly reach like 12-15 years of age so I don't know if it's lack of knowledge about the breed or if it's general vet-consensus that 13 is too old for surgery. 

Should I get a second opinion from somewhere else, or just let it be and keep an eye on my old girl?

She's healthy otherwise, sleeps a lot ofc, and a bit stiff in the joints, but she runs up and down the stairs without issues, jumps up and down the beds etc, loves walks and insists on taking the long way even though she probably shouldn't.
 She's basically my only friend and family at this point  and I love her so much, I want to do everything I can to keep her happy and alive for as long as I can, but I don't know how much is reasonable. 

Any advice appreciated.

Morning everyone. 

I'm having a crap day today, just using here as a hit of a safe space to offload and to gather some  thoughts from the community. 

Im in the process of trying to drastically cut down my caffeine usage in prep for titration (seen some anecdotes about caffeine usage whilst on stimulants). I've moved on to decaff coffee and have limited my energy drink intake to a very maximum of 2 a day (still a lot, but nowhere near the three coffees and 3-4 energy drinks I was having daily). I'm currently on decaff coffee number 2 of the morning and I cannot focus AT ALL. Usually, my most productive time is in the mornings and I generally trail off towards the afternoon. But today, it's a non-starter. Do I just try and battle through, or hit the caffeine... I'm so torn. 

My blood pressure seems to be constantly through the roof at the moment, and my anxiety isn't much better. Only time my BP is a good level is when I take anxiety meds. I don't want to report this to the med assessor and it skew the results. I'm terrified of being refused the most suitable medication based on BP alone. 

Also, what's the deal with trying to get mental health support to talk through a diagnosis and/or address the trauma from pre-diagnosis? I reached out to my private medical benefit provider - ""We don't offer any coverage for nuerodevelopmental conditions"". I reached out to a charity that supports people in my profession - ""We can't offer any support services for ADHD"". I reached out to my local trust's Mental Health support services - ""You don't score high enough on the depression/anxiety scales for us to offer you support"". It's one of the most incredibly frustrating things I've ever experienced. 

Glamorisation (I don't know if that's a word, and if it is whether it's spelt properly or not). That shit needs to stop. It's hard enough having to live with the ""superpower"" of constant burn-out to then have to fight against the stigma for the disorder. Any source material out there that helps with general education?? 

PIP - Has anyone had any successes with PIP? My partner is encouraging me to apply for it, but I don't even know where I stand morally on this one. I feel like PIP should be for those whose lives are drastically altered by their conditions and not just ""I can't take the bus because the noise of the engine makes me angry"". 

Sorry for the offload. I think I just needed to write a whole load of shit down. ARGH!!  So frustrated.

1ozdgva,https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/1ozdgva/revamping_older_ships_please_fdev/,Revamping older ships please Fdev,"Just having a coffee and thinking about spaceships. I feel it would be great to have more balance and tweaks to existing ships since the addition of new ship models brought in this past year.

All older ships have such charm still. It's unrealistic to expect a mk 2 version of every ship. Not every ship manufacturer wants to reinvent their menu. They are corporations and as such are looking for cheaper alternatives to stay competitive with the new era ships.

I think a total rebalance with the recent technologies available in game could justify retrofitting all older ships with adjustments. Helping to define specific niche roles once again. Even before we received new ships some were lacking and their only silver lining was being a cheap stepping stone. 

Not limited to here are some of my ideas:

Type 7. Improve heat, add SCO, and make it fit somewhere between the type 8 and type 9 in terms of cargo capacity. It's a lovely looking ship.

Keelback. This thing is fun. And it's a little gem. Make those independent thrusters work. Give it more manuverbility, SCO, and maybe a smidgen more cargo.

Type 10. This was the Alliances answer to the Thargoids, in theory their big ship to compete with the other powers. Sadly it's a pretty good afk turret. The whole thing needs attention, another lovely ship.

Finally all the Replocked ships, and Alliance counterparts. What's the point of grinding rank to get an old ship. At least make them SCO optimized. The Federal Dropship should be changed to Federal Transporter because it has never been used as a Dropship. It's the ""workhorse"" of the Federation yet has always been lacking.

Anyways was wondering what your thoughts are on a total rework of the games ships and drop and idea or 2 that you would like to see. I enjoy reading!

You're either „on track"" or you've failed. But what if FIRE is actually a toolkit, not a destination? 
If you are following r/FIRE or the orthodox subs that all make the FI at least if not the RE a necessity underlined with concrete minimum/maximum numbers then you may protest: This is diluting the movement! Fair enough. 

Consider lurking, though. Many people do – with a reason. 

TL;DR: Practicing FIRE (without a hard „RE"" goal) gives you literacy, agency, and a plan for bad days. Use the tools; skip the obsession. 


The Heresy Nobody Talks About

Here's the uncomfortable truth: lots of people follow FIRE principles without ever planning to pull the plug. 
They lurk in r/financialindependence, absorb wisdom from r/leanfire and r/povertyfire, maybe even peek at r/fatFIRE to see how life feels among the peers at the other half — but they're not actually trying to retire at 40. Is this some kind of treason? A shortcoming of character?
Not here.
We deliberately chose „It's Complicated"" because we don't want FIRE as dogma. We want it useful. 
We have no problem with anyone who is UnFIRING, cherry-picking just some elements of FIRE but retiring in line with mainstream ideas. Hell, we admit right away that by no means will we ever consider spending time in a van other than for some transportation to a hotel or so but there's so much practical and hands-on wisdom we can learn from r/povertyFIRE and the patient, community-centered mentality that the pioneers brought to the big FIRE subs.

This post is for the outliers who don't fit the useful categories. This is for the FIRE dropout who isn't even really intoFIRE whatsoever anymore. Because FIRE can be a door-opener to a more reflected understanding of the role of money, income, and – inevitably - the real big questions of life.

You don't have to retire early to benefit from thinking like someone who could. Or even retire „super early.“ Retiring at 60 instead of 67? Still counts. Still valuable. Still worth the practice.""

Why Follow FIRE Even If You Won't Pull the Plug?
Financial literacy on autopilot. You learn where your money leaks and what actually matters to you.
Agency beats anxiety. A clear „if X, then Y"" turns doomscrolling into decisions.
Emergency-ready by default. Buffers and checklists already live in your plan.

But… beware over-optimization. If money becomes your main personality trait, you'll miss the life you wanted FIRE for.

Meet Stefan: Practice-FI in Action
Stefan is 34 and plans to work until just a bit below what he expects to be the classical retirement age in his country in the future. But he does his Practice-FI ritual weekly: automates one thing, checks his buffer, hangs out at Reddit and also shares some of his experiences.
Last year his department downsized. Most colleagues panicked. Stefan didn’t. He had a clear plan already mapped out. No panic. No desperation.
He took a month off, reassessed his priorities, and chose his next role from a position of strength. He'll probably never „retire super early""—and that's completely fine. The FIRE toolkit gave him options when life got complicated.

That's the dream. Not necessarily the RE. The calm.


Practice-FI (30 Minutes/Week or YEAR)
You don't need to optimize your life into oblivion. Try this ritual:

One automation (bill or investment).

One ""good enough"" estimate (you don't need perfect data to move forward).

One micro-upgrade (cancel a zombie subscription; add a cash-buffer week).

One sentence you can say out loud: ""If the market drops 20%, I'll cut discretionary spending 15% and won't sell for 90 days.""

Having a sentence you can say matters. When anxiety hits, your brain needs simple, pre-decided language. A smart friend instinctively knew about this. So she had this one sentence at hand when I needed it and I am forever grateful for that. 

🚨Red Flags That You've Crossed Into Obsession

1️⃣ You skip low-cost joy „just to keep the streak."" An overpriced coffee to go on a cold November day in Amsterdam is not a sin. 

2️⃣ You argue about basis points but haven't booked next prophylactic treatment at your dentist.

3️⃣ Your partner hears „we can't afford it"" more often than „what do we really want?""

4️⃣ You've calculated your coast-FIRE number three times this week but haven't called your mom.

5️⃣ Every conversation somehow loops back to savings rates. (For some this works at it can drastically reduce the cost of social interactions…😅

If you're nodding at more than two of these: take a breath. FIRE is supposed to make your life better, not narrower.

🗣️Your Turn

(We like a blonde roast and Nespresso does not have that.) Things have been working fine: I would take an original Vertuo pod, dump and clean it out by wiping it, add my coffee, tamp it down, and brew. This worked flawlessly and when the pod got too damaged (sometimes the barcode would get scratched if not careful or if liquid is used to clean the pods as the paint on them is water soluble) I would just reuse another.

Here’s where things get interesting. A few days ago, I went to brew me a cup and suddenly I got an error (humming for a long time before red light, not producing any drip). I figured that it was damaged, so I tried another pod; same thing. I did have an unused pod so I put it in there and suddenly it worked. Refilled it again and it didn’t. I had a hare brained idea and took an unused pod, empty it out the coffee and replaced it with mine and it worked. But again if I reused it, it wouldn’t.

This is strange. I’m guessing that somehow it can tell if a pod is being reused by the way it is acting. Has there been a firmware upgrade lately? I know there are no bubbles in the line because it works with a new pod. If that’s not the case, then something is preventing “old” pods from being read.  The barcodes are fine to my visual look over (if it is damaged, I can’t see it.) Has anyone ran across this recently?

I wanted to make a post as a counter-example to Dr K.'s latest video, to show how AI-usage could be used in a healthy way, at least I believe that it did so for me. If you have contrary opinions to this, I'd love to hear them.

So my situation has been this: I'm a 27 year old male, who have never been in a romantic relationship. Throughout my life, I've struggled with an anxious attachment style, and as I would later find out, with limerence. Since I was around 16 years old, I've periodically gone to therapy to help with my self-esteem issues and I have also worked a lot on my self, studying psychology, relationships and analysing the existential questions.

Despite viewing myself as a relatively stable and happy person, love has always been a major struggle in my life. I struggled mainly with becoming very attached, very quickly. Falling in love always tended to feel like becoming hit by a truck. Moreover, due to my autism, I struggle to read subtle social cues. Lastly, due to past experience with love that has gone very wrong (when I have behaved in less than appropriate ways due to a spike in anxiety) I never trusted my own instincts and intuitions (partly because I knew that my affection wouldn't be matched so early in the relationship).

A few months ago, after meeting a girl I was attracted to, I started to use chatGPT for emotional regulation advice. Then I started to ask it about pacing and to get an outline of what the process could look like, being detailed about the interactions. To me, dating was always a mystery to me. When do you ask someone out on a date? What type of activities should you do? When do you go for a kiss? How far in advance should you ask someone out for a coffee? When should you start touching and how much? I was completely clueless about all of these questions earlier, to me, dating felt like walking into a room blindfolded to play dart, and maybe hope that you hit something. Nobody could tell me the answers to pacing, but the AI did. It told me how many days in advance to ask for a coffee, how I could slow down, how often I was supposed to meet her based on my current state of mind etc.

Imagine writing a thesis paper, where you have absolutely no idea how fast you will be writing, how long the thesis should be or how long it would take. Does section X take a few days to write? weeks? months? years? That is how lost I felt when it came to pacing and dating.

The fact that I just got any answer at all made my nervous system calm down. I suddenly had a structure to lean back on, some kind of pacing to go with, and it turned out to work well. This is the first time in my life where I have managed to tame and endure the limer-beast. Previously, the limerence would get so overwhelming that I started to behave in a way that eventually made me get rejected, where ""reality"" checked in and the limerence disappeared. This time, I managed to wait out the storm, until it has settled for something far more quiet and pleasant. Eventually, I confessed my feelings for her, steeling myself for a rejection, but instead, she said that the feelings were mutual.

I prompted the AI to always be as brutally honest as possible, to be concrete and very specific. (I also never read the first paragraph of the responses, because it was all about telling me what a genius I was for asking the questions that I did). Of course, I'm not going to say that the AI did all the work, because a lot of it (if not most of it) came from self-help and therapy, and I also had a close friend to talk to. I was also already in the process of moving towards a secured attachment when I met her. Yet I don't believe would have managed it if I didn't have chatGPT to help me out.

And maybe it is a risk, maybe it checks all the boxes of the risky usage of AI-behavior. What do you think?",12,1763376726.0,Healthygamergg,3,0.84,False

I am in international student from India who moved to the UK for pursuing master's. After reaching here, I installed paypal and added my debit card of my UK bank account (which is not a high street bank, by the way).

Two months ago, my brother sent me money on paypal from India, and paypal withheld that money, citing the fact that I am new to the app. I provided all documents they asked me, but nothing changed. Their customer care wasn't of much help either.

Last month, a friend of mine here in the UK transferred money to my paypal (I thought she would send it to my bank account, we didn't communicate properly), but surprisingly that money wasn't withheld and I can see it on my paypal balance now (which I once used to pay for a coffee).

So I tried transferring this paypal balance to my bank account, which is not working, no matter how much I try. A lot of stores here don't take payments from PayPal.

So now I've got money on hold, and money in paypal balance, both of which I want to transfer to my bank account. I have tried pretty much everything I could, but nothing worked.

I usually take evening shifts, but sometimes they put me on morning ones. During one of those morning shifts about two weeks ago, among all the rude and clueless customers, she showed up. A really pleasant and kind girl. She looked around 24–26.

She ordered a drink people don’t usually get here – a matcha latte. My coworker, who’s way more experienced than me, made her an insanely beautiful heart on the milk foam. I swear, I’d never seen latte art that good in my life. Literal masterpiece.

My coworker went to the bathroom, and I called the girl up to pick up her drink. She was shocked when she saw that heart. She thought I made it. For the next half hour while she sat in the coffee shop, I kept catching her looking at me. Maybe I’m overreacting and just imagining things, but I really think she was actually staring at me. When she was leaving, she looked at me for a few seconds while saying goodbye and almost walked straight into a wall.

I get that this could’ve just been normal politeness toward a barista, but it really felt like something more. None of the customers ever acted like that before.

Today I had another morning shift. And again, among the stream of rude, grumpy workers rushing to their jobs, she appeared. I suddenly felt weird – this rush of adrenaline and embarrassment, even though I wasn’t doing anything wrong. It felt like I fell in love or something.

She ordered a matcha latte again, but this time to go. Neither my coworker nor I could draw a new heart on it. She sat down, ate a dessert. I tried to make her catch me looking at her, but nothing really happened. She didn’t stay long – smiled a bit and left.

I’ve been thinking about going up to her. I don’t know how weird it is, because I’m 19 and she looks way older – like I said, around 25. I’d approach her off-shift and say something like, “I like you, and I’d love to talk to you outside the coffee shop. Here’s my number, text or call me if you want.”

1ozctot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ozctot/colleague_takes_my_things_when_im_not_at_work/,Colleague takes my things when I'm not at work.,"Hi,

So I've been working at this place for almost 3 years, always sitting next to the same colleague. Like a year into working here she started asking me if she could have a piece of gum here and there (I obviously always said yes), I also had a box of tissues and she would sometimes take one or two. She then started to take my gum without asking, with me there (like she would scoot her chair next to me, reach with her arm in front of me and take the gum). In the summer I came back from my 2 weeks of vacation and found I had almost no tissues or gum left. She told me they had all been taking some here and there and laughed it off saying ""we owe you some chewing gum haha"". So I stopped bringing tissues and gum. A few months passed and I was pissed that I couldn't have gum when I wanted, so I started bringing gum again. She would again start asking me for gum (but less, and it didn't seem like she has taken any while I was away).

Two weeks ago she wanted some tea bud hadn't brought any, (she usually takes a second coffee at that time, but had been told off by HR for going to the coffee machine too often). I offered her a tea from the box I have on my desk, she took it and I thought that was it. Last week I went on vacation, today she tells me ""I owe you 4 tea bags haha I keep forgetting to buy them (that's always her excuse btw)"". A few minutes later she adds ""I also cleaned your mug, by the way. The other day when you had to leave because your mother in law died, I leaned over to take a gum from you and I saw it was dirty so I cleaned it"".


I am so non confrontational it's stupid, so I feel like I can't say anything to her but I'm SO angry she keeps taking my stuff! What can I do so she takes the hint?

Just for some context: I have my things like sugar, tea bags and gum in a cute cardboard box on my desk, because we don't have any drawers of any kind.",1,1763375255.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1ozctbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ozctbc/im_beginning_to_resent_my_friend_for_her_jealousy/,"I’m beginning to resent my friend for her jealousy, and i dont know what to do","ok to start off with, ive never posted on reddit before and im writing this on my phone. also, by nature im a very non confrontational person and my friend is a very naturally defensive person who never takes accountability for anything (as proven by how she talks about our other friends when shes upset with them) so naturally, i dont really know how to bring it up and so in turn, i held in my minor grievances and its starting to foster into resentment. it has now almost reached a boiling point. we r both 18 F.

So, to start off with im a naturally quiet person who moved provinces two years ago. in this span of time, ive only really made one close friend (who we will call J) and by extension, her friends as well (who im not that close to). its important to note that J refers to me as her best friend, but this only occured after  she started slowly resenting our other friend (who she previously referred to as her best friend) after that friend got a boyfriend. she found small things to nitpick her over, complained she talked abt my bf too much, and that she was a bitch. we both ended up somewhat distancing ourselves from that friend, but in doing so, i guess i kind of replaced her.

during the summer, we hung out almost everyday consistently. but there was a couple of small things that had bugged me.

1. she would consistently ask to borrow my clothes. since i have a lot of clothes, and i love helping out others, i would always let her borrow them for specific events when she had a specific outfit in mind but didnt have the clothes to pull it off (photoshoots, concerts, hiking, etc..) she would wear the clothes, and then…… keep wearing the clothes. idk, please let me know if i am overreacting for this but i find it extremely frustrating that she would begin adding MY clothes to her closet rotation AFTER the specific event she borrowed them for and continuously wear them out until i would gently remind her that i would like them back. she has never returned my clothes without me asking for them back. she never damaged or wrecked the clothes, but one time i went over to her house to retrieve 4 items of clothing. she said i could grab them and told me to look for them myself, and i found my clothes lazily thrown onto the floor like theyre her own clothes. i have a lululemon align tank top i borrowed her one time and i specifically wanted that piece back. not because i wear it often, but because its lululemon yknow?? but she wore it A LOT. i gave it to her for a hiking trip. but then she snapped me wearing it at her job. and then one time we were hanging out late at night at her house, she said “let me change into pajamas” proceeded to put on my lululemon tank top and sat back down like it was normal. but as i was searching through her closet, i couldnt find my align tank. i asked her to help me look for it, to which she paused and very carefully said tgat it ‘might be in her moms closet.’ since it was late at night, and her mom was sleeping and works early, i decided to let it go and asked if she would look for it and bring me it sometime soon. she said yes and i left. that happened in the summer, and shes never given it back. however, i also havent seen her wear it since.

2. weird immature behaviour. this is just cut and dry. we both use snapchat since were 18 lol, and when J is upset at someone shes friends with she will intentionally ‘half face’ snap them and text very bluntly and dryly. she has openly admitted this is intentional to me when she was doing it to another one of our friends. i think its weird. this will be important later.

3. she talks down every guy i talk to. in the summer i began using dating apps, and met two guys that i liked a lot. one, who was an amazing guy, she made fun of his nose, and like… paused? at his face and style. but whatever. the other one, who was much more serious and will come up later, she made fun of weird things like his last name, but also how he acted and his personality. when we went on a double date with her and her bf, she would give me an intentionally disgusted look whenever he spoke or said something she deemed ‘weird.’ which was a lot.
that guy and i ended things pretty badly and so im now afraid of seeing him in public, which again, will come up later at my boiling point. the last guy (who we can call N) is actually a guy that our other friend, M, introduced me to since hes friends with her boyfriend. she makes fun of his instagram posts, his tiktoks, the things he says, and whatever. its interesting to note that when we both met N for the first time, we agreed that he was very good looking (despite the fact she has a bf). not to mention, i dont know why she talks down every guy i talk to to, and even said im “not allowed to date N” because her bf isnt even that great either, hes very controlling and she seems like she hates him 90% of the time.

4. this is just misc stuff, but it builds up yknow? shes very whiney. possibly because shes basically an only child (her half siblings moved out very young and are much older, and are from her dad, whereas shes lived with her mom for most of her life.) if she doesnt get her way she will begin whining like a kid. she is a compulsive complainer. she finds a way to twist everything to be negative. and when i offer solutions, she just brushes them off to continue whining. for example, once she complained that our nail tech had messed up a small but fixable portion of her gel nails. i suggested she just text our nail tech, and said i was sure she’d fix them for free. she just said ‘i dont know…’ then proceeds to continue whining and complaining about her nails. and continue. and continue for weeks. ive realized that maybe she just likes having problems. note that she could literally LITERALLY complain about anything that is mildly wrong. its become expected of me to coddle and comfort her to make her feel better. this complaining isnt limited to just herself though, she of course complains about other people as well. shes very judgey, and often talks A LOT about people behind their back. like said before, she would consistently complain our other friend talked too much about her boyfriend. if i really thought about it, i could probably write a lot more, but its 1 am and i just want to continue on.

5. she doesnt care about what i have to say. she always talks about herself, melodrama at her job, what her mom says, what her boyfriend says, or.. like in point 4, complain lol. I always listen attentively, and respond. like a normal person. but yet, i feel as though every time i try and talk about something happening in my life, if it isnt gossip, she’ll just respond with something like “yeah” or worse. she’ll say ‘lol’ out loud and thats it. no follow up questions, nothing. i wonder if she even listens to me or is just instead waiting for me to finish talking so she can begin talking about herself again. like said before, its become expected in the friendship for me to accomodate for her, so ive began kind of sucking it up, but it still stings that im not being listened to.

6. i know she talks about me behind my back. although nothing explicitly mean has been said (that i atleast know of) she airs out my business and it leaks out in other ways. for example, after the guy from hinge and i went our seperate ways very very messily, the next day me, J, and our other friend went hiking. while J was out of the car, my other friend innocently asked ‘so, what happened with that piece of shit?’ i was confused because i hadnt told her and asked what she meant. she said hinge guys name and i asked her how she knew, and she said that J said something bad had happened between me and the guy and that we were done. i confronted J about it, and she just casually said ‘so? i didnt think it mattered. its just (other friends name).’ and she brings up in convo a lot conversations that she has with M about me and N. i tell her everything she needs to know, so it annoys me that shes speculating my romantic life without me. and based on my other point that she talks down every guy i talk to, i know that its not that good. since she tried making it a point that she was trying to say tgat i “couldnt date N” to M because of his tiktoks, and that M defended N by saying ‘thats just N.’ she tried twisting it that M was being mean, but i was just like … why are you saying that.

that kind of wraps up everything that has built up and why i have been upset with her, i know it seems small but it really builds up. and im sure theres more things shes done that have pissed me off in more specific instances, but my memory in general is very foggy so its a lot to write down. she says im her best friend and that shes never had a friend like me, and that she wants me to be the MOH at her wedding (weve been friends for just over a year so😭) but her ignorance is really building up. and so.. my boiling point ensues.

cue to before halloween. since were 18 year olds (legal drinking age where were from) we like going out a lot to the bars. i was excited for halloween weekend (both friday and saturday) and i thought it was mutually understood between us that we were going out both nights. we discussed costumes, and she brought up the idea of matching costumes. although i wanted to wear what i wanted to wear myself both nights and DIDNT WANT TO DO THE MATCHING COSTUMES, i wanted to make her happy so i agreed. she would send me costume ideas but i didnt really like them, so i sent a few costumes back and we decided on a matching costume together based on my choice. even though it was a costume she didnt choose, i thought it was fine. i wonder now that maybe the reason (spoiler alert lol) it didnt go through was because /i/ was the one who chose the costume. Anyways, multiple times we discussed halloweekend. i asked her multiple times if she booked off both days (friday and saturday) from work yet, and she would just brush it off and be like ‘yeah i guess i have to do that.’ we looked online for outfits for our matching costume and we curated a cart for her costume. she sounded like she genuinely wanted to buy it. so, since i was confident the plans were going through, i bought my own costume for one day, and then my half of the matching one for the next. after a little bit, she admitted she hadnt ordered the things online yet and she said she was concerned that if she ordered it it wouldnt come on time. and so, we went in a costume store together to look for outfits, and she sounded like she genuinely was going to buy them but just didnt at the time. Keep in mind, this is not a money issue. she makes more than me and works more than me since im in school and shes not. she constantly shows me her bank account that has way more money than what i have in mine, and she doesnt pay any bills.

and then, she texts me a week and a half ish before halloweekend and is like “sorry, i work on friday. but only the morning shift so i can go out still, but i probably wont go out saturday because i work the morning shift sunday and dont want to be hungover.” i guess thats perfectly fine in its own right, except for the fact that she bought a matching costume for her and her bf, and didnt buy the matching costume that was suppoded to be for the two of us.. so. keep in mind, i continously gently reminded her to book off all of halloweekend so we could go out for the two days and to get her half of the matching costume, because THAT WAS OUR PLAN WE DISCUSSED AND AGREED TO. she never implied she didnt want to go out both nights until that day. so im like “oh ok, thats fine,” even though, yes i really was annoyed. if she didnt want to proceed with the plans i just think it was really rude that she strung me along to buy two costumes if i only needed my own yknow? So whatever.

and then, our friend M texted me and was like ‘hey, me, N and our friend group are going out to (big city in our province) for a bar crawl on saturday for halloween. wanna come?’ keep in mind, J, her bf and i were just going out in our small town. so i agree, happy i now have something to do for both days of halloween! i tell J and she seems kind of dismissive and annoyed.

in this period of time, J’s boyfriend surprised her with a concert she had been wanting to go to for a long time, and this concert happened to fall on the saturday that i would be going to (big city) with N and M. she told me “good thing i have something to do on saturday now, otherwise i would have crashed out that you and M are hanging out without me.”
… ok.
so saturday of halloween comes and me, N, M and their friend group go to the bar crawl. i keep snapping J throughout the night, but i began getting the ‘half face snap’ treatment. im confused but whatever. i text her that we saw our coworker that J and i both LOVE and all she responds with is ‘lol’ .. i get dry treatment for the rest of the night.

Whatever, sunday rolls around and since we all obviously spent the night in (big city) at one of the guys’ in the groups house, we were all kind of hanging out and chilling before the ones who still lived back home had to do our 2 hour drive back home. me and M both snap her while we are just chilling out with each other and we are both receiving half face snaps. J has literally told both of us she does this intentionally when shes upset. both M and i are confused what shes upset about, but come to the conclusion that she must be jealous that we are hanging out without her. yes, jealousy is normal and understandable. but acting on it so weirdly and making it our problem is not. keep in mind, that while M and i are both friends, we are not very close and the ONLY reason i was invited is because N and i are ‘talking’ to each other and he was too shy to invite me. technically, i am N’s +1, not M’s. as well as the fact that she is literally in a whole other city with her bf and supposed to be having fun at a concert with him!! focus on yourself instead of wallowing in misery about others!!

so now the idea that J is jealous when i hang out with other people despite the fact her and i are almost attached to the hip anyways (and when were not she hangs out with other people and ive never treated her like how she treats me over it) is implanted in my head.

and so now knowing J hates me and M hanging out with each other comes to this week. earlier this week, M told me that her and N’s friendgroup are going to the bars on friday and that i should come. i told her i have work but i should be able to come out afterwards. i told J that M invited me to go out on friday and her mood immediately sours. she begins asking me if im excited to go/if i even wanna go. since im kind of a doormat and people pleaser, i knew that if i acted disinterested in going out she would be happy. and so i do so. her mood immediately switches to happy again and we continue to hangout like normal.

thursday rolls around and M asks if im still good for friday, i say yes and then M asks ‘has J said anything about me behind my back lately?’ and since J truthfully hadnt said anything at all, i say no and ask why she would ask that. she explains that for the whole week J had been dry snapping and dry texting her. i say its weird, but i had a weird suspicion that it was because M had invited me out and J was getting upset at her because of that. M explains that she asked J what she was doing friday night, to which J only said ‘working’ and since this is clearly a disinterested response, M says ‘aw dang’ instead of trying to continue inviting her and J says ‘ye’

So.. friday rolls around. i hadnt gotten a good nights sleep that night, woke up early, had two tests in school, and had to work. i realized that if i went out drinking that night i would be in a horrible mood around people who im not that close with, and was debating if i should suck it up with an energy drink or cancel the plans to relax. i didnt say this to anyone and was just quietly debating in my head.
But then, J texts me. she asked if i wanted to bedrot with her that night. but… the thing is J KNEW i had plans with M that night. i told her. M hinted at inviting her. theres no way she’d simply forget. i knew that this was a test.

if i say “no, i have plans”: she has a reason to be upset at me, dry snap and act passive aggressive towards me, and probably talk about me behind my back to her newest friend shes been hanging out with a lot more recently.

if i agree to hangout with her: she wins, she still seems like the priority in my social life, and i dont hangout with M without her.
since i was already debating on cancelling, and i felt the passive aggression wouldnt be worth it, i agreed and hung out with her.
while im hanging out with her, she eludes to her conversation with M and changes the story to that M was the one being dry, when all J said was that she was just working, when the reality of the situation is that M backed down on inviting J because J seemed so obviously disinterested.

J continues her story and says, “yeah, im just not feeling well and i feel like if i explained that to M she’d get mad at me cause i dont wanna go out” i have a sneaking suspicion that J can’t say the reason shes mad at M is because her and i are hanging out without J, and so is trying to discreetly implant the idea in my head that M is a mean girl towards J to make me dislike her, and seperate me and M by making me pick and choose between them.

the next morning M texted me and said their friendgroup was going out again and im welcome to come. feeling well rested and bad for cancelling the night previous, i tell her i’ll come out. J and i decide to get coffee together and J tells me M invited her to go out to the bars, and i say that i was also invited. J asks if im going to go, and i say yes.

J tells me if i need a dd then she can drive me since she’ll just go out with her bf or stay at his house and get me when im done. i tell her that its okay i don’t need her to since either the group will drive me home or my dad will, and that i’d only like her as a DD if i see ex hinge guy at the bar (since its his bday weekend), or im upset. she agrees and we go back home.
as im getting ready for the night, she texts and offers to dd me again. i dont really think about it and since we had the conversation irl before where i said i DIDNT need her to unless those conditions stated above, i just say “okie, sounds good” and continue getting ready.

her bf fell asleep on their plans and so she decides to hangout with her cousin instead. while deciding on their hangout, she says “or i might just come to the bar and have one drink” and since shes my friend and i didnt think itd be a big deal, im like “yeah! come have a drink! you can hang with me”
she tells me her and her cousin are going out, i tell her to have fun, shes like “no no were going to the same bar, just pretend you dont see us” and im like “i cant talk to you?” and she says “no you can, i just dont want to talk to that group (i.e.: M and N’s friendgroup)”

i end up feeling frustrated about how N is acting at the bar, so i decide to hangout with J and her cousin instead for a little bit since im ultimately closer to J and like her cousin as well. The first thing J says to me is… “did M say anything about me tonight?” i lie and say no, even though M was talking about her behind J’s back but its pretty much just a reflection on her and J’s conversation. i end up hanging out with them for a pretty big portion of the night. i tell them that i should probably go back to my OG group cause i feel bad for leaving for so long. we say bye and i go back to meet up with M and N’s friendgroup.

M is upset and asks if J said anything bad about her, i say no (truth) but ask why shes asking. M says that when she saw J walking around, she tried saying hi and talking to her, but J ignored her and kept talking to her cousin. it ended up making M cry. i feel bad and hangout with M, but a girl ended up spilling M’s drink all over her, so me and M go to the bathroom to clean herself up.
M and i leave the bathroom and J and her cousin are outside, J was like “me and (cousin) are leaving, are you ready?” i was like “okay, see you” and J is like “no, no, are you ready?”

im very drunk already, and what shes asking is confusing me. J kept saying that she only had one drink, wasnt having fun, and that “otherwise it was a waste of gas for me to come here” (implying that the only reason she came out to the bars was to dd me, but since the whole dd thing was conditional there was no need for her to dd me, as well as the fact that i personally thought the reason she came to the bars was because her cousin wanted to go, and we had already told her to come by. does this make sense?) i truly didnt understand what she was saying, what she meant by that it was a waste of gas, and why she kept saying no to me saying goodbye to her and her cousin. keep in mind, i am drunk! but not the sloshed drunk where its like i have to be forced to leave the bar. i was not being stubborn, i truly was genuinely confused and didnt need her to drive me home.

since im confused and she keeps saying shes going to go but wont leave, im like “um. can i just dance to this song? i really like it” because she was talking to me away from the dance floor. she says “sure, just come meet up with us after” im like .. “uh.. ok?” im STILL genuinely confused. M and i end up reconnecting with N and the other boys and i end up dancing more and forgetting to look for J. after the song ended apparently she texted me saying ‘wya’ but since i wasnt looking at my phone, i didnt see and end up leaving her on delivered. she ends up finding me dancing, taps me on the shoulder and is like “are you ready to go? the bars about to close” and it finally clicked what shes trying to say. she misunderstood and thought she was dding me home. i stand there stunned and im like “uh… i didnt need you to drive me home” J looks pissed, literally says “K.” IN REAL LIFE, turns around and leaves the bar without saying anything else. shes never been so directly rude to my face before, usually its all snapchat passive aggression, so i was shocked and pissed that she got mad at me for HER misunderstanding.

yes i understand it was a miscommunication. but im just very very upset. This small incident is my boiling point. i dont know what to say, in my whole 18 years of life ive only confronted friends a small handful of times. id rather be a peacekeeper while keeping my stress and hurt inside my head without making it other peoples problems. Its just so stupid.

today, she asked M if i was upset after she left the bar and M told her that she thinks i was just confused. M said J said: “she said that you had told  her she was ur dd” No i did not. it was conditional. i had a ride home otherwise. yes i am confused. i dont know why shes jealous. i dont know why she treats me and M so rudely whenever were hanging out without her. when she hangs out with our other friends without me and ive never treated her like this. i feel like she wanted me to leave with her so i wouldnt keep hanging out with M without her. do you guys know what im saying??? i feel like i shouldnt have to people please one of my supposed ‘best friends.’

Ive been ignoring J all day because i dont even wanna deal with the passive aggressive half face snaps, and i feel upset that she treats me and M like this because she’s upset that were hanging out when M invited her out both nights. She texted me asking if i wanted to go for a drive, but since i was busy and not on my phone, i ended up responding almost an hour later. she was like “im in bed now sorry” so i said “its fine lol” and she said “Alr” i know. im being stupid and petty back.

anyways, sorry for word vomit. this is probs my first and only post on reddit. i would just like advice on what to say, maybe how to confront her? if this post wasnt obvious enough, i am kind of a doormat. when our friendship is good its good but when she treats me like this, it just sours it for me completely. even just peoples two cents on the situation would be nice too, i understand my passiveness is kind of enabling her behaviour, but i would also just like to note J is still basically my only friend in this province. we are still close and i like her most of the time. yes i have M to hang out with, but we arent very close and have only hung out 1 on 1 while we were in (big city) for halloween. i have no other friends that arent J’s friend as well, since she basically introduced me to everyone. i act very passive and deal with it because i am very lonely otherwise, and losing J would make me lose my whole social life (i guess before i met N and started talking with him) since im very bad at making friends:,)

TLDR; my friend is very jealous, whiney, and has been rude lately. i am a complete doormat and have been enabling this our whole friendship. my boiling point in our friendship was a misunderstanding of her dding me to which she stormed off after i told her she didnt need to. shes never been genuinely pissed at me irl and i wouldnt like peoples 2 cents on my situation

**1: Barbuta**. Liked the idea to pay attention to anything unusual. But the pace is too slow. Need more cryptic stuff with faster movement. I want to have hit effect otherwise I feel like one level beggar desperately swinging a dagger to hit a mudcrab in Morrowind.

**2: Bug Hunter**. As not a logic games fan I was hooked immediately. Curiosity is the key! Tell yourself ""It would be great to do this and that"". Thus I discovered stomping and pushing into the pit.

**3: Ninpek**. Classic ninja platformer done right. Can't say there is any cool gimmick, it is just well made.

**4: Paint Chase**. A bit weird and stressful but okay

**5: Magic Garden**. Cute snake game, well made. Classic casual games like Snake, Tetris etc are dope and it seems that all game mechanics are already invented but everytime I see a new one I am truly surprised by human brain's creativity.

**6: Mortol.** Challenging with good difficulty balance. I wish it could have more interesting theme other than just sacrificing bunch of guys. As a sixth game it's fine.

**7: Velgress**. Stressful but fun as hell. All my fails are my own, can't hate the game. At least it is easier than Star Waspir.

**8: Planet Zoldath**. It was okay to complete once. Not my cup of coffee but I appreciate it.

**9: Attactics**. Fun and short, sweet. My advice is to hit enemy base as soon as possible. Cherry is quite hard, when you are one victory away from rank 100 it is so easy to fall from the steps.

**10: Devilition**. It makes you pray while detonate. It seems a bit long but fair enough.

**11: Kick Club**. This kind of games you tend to hate due to difficulty but then you realize that it is skill issue or you just hurry too much. Another great example of small touches, e.g. the gate is the Boss!

**12: Avianos**. Takes some time do learn and hard to understand the rules without a guide. Birds praying dino ancestors is genius idea.

**13: Mooncat**. I wish it would have normal controls. Have to play it again to see the rest of levels. Unusual controls is not a good gimmick - the game already has unusual moving, that's enough. You have to be really concentrated and observant, especially when figuring out how bouncing from a mushroom works (it is simple though).

**14: Bushido Ball.** Any sports/common game where you can launch super shots is 10x better. Why Technos Japan didn't made this one but made baseball game no one needs. I'm so glad there is no baseball in UFO 50.

**15: Block Koala**. At first I hated it because several levels were too difficult but then I liked it. But I understand those who hate it. I recommend a mod for 2x speed increase. Have to take away one star because learning difficulty curve kicked me hard several times.

**16: Camouflage**. Fun game with chill out vibes

**17: Campanella**. Another stressful game requiring precise movement and determination. I suffered a lot but I respect the game.

**18: Golfaria**. The map should be smaller or easier and have more bosses. I used map for navigation and getting collectibles otherwise I'd get tired of backtracking. Can't see any reason to play it again.

**19: The Big Bell Race**. Just a good racing game. I wish UFO 50 have a true racing game.

**20: Warptank**. Another game that hooked me imediatelly. Brilliant.

**21: Waldorf's Journey**. I love this game but afraid of falling down.

**22: Porgy**. The pace should be much faster. More equippable upgrades at once please.

**23: Onion Delivery**. I hate it even the game is very good. Don't wanna play it again. Rage Quit score: 10 onions of 10. I don't have fear anymore because what can be worse than Onion Monster.

**24: Caramel Caramel**. At least it is not so difficult as Star Waspir.

**25: Party House**. I don't play this type of card games. The first one I got hooked immediately was Inscryption. Party House is the second one.

**26: Hot Foot**. Standard sports games are boring as hell. This one is a good example how to make sports games fun again. As a long time Nekketsu/Kunio kun franchise fan I give this game a seal of quality.

**27: Divers**. Not for me. Too slow, so much backtracking, so little secrets.

**28: Rail Heist**. I was showing my friend all UFO 50 games quickly and this one caught his attention. Haha, his face was priceless after seeing what UFO 50 is.

**29: Vainger**. Not a Metroidvania fan. The game is very good though.

**30: Rock On! Island**. If UFO Soft takes any genre and spice it up we get another banger. I smiled reading people comments who didn't realize they could upgrade their weapon. Guys, be curious, come on, it was easy to find out.

**31: Pingolf**. Another fun game with chill out vibes and spiced up with dunk mechanics. I used to play these kind of games to relax after hours of suffering in Star Waspir.

**32: Mortol II**. Weird but okay

**33: Fist Hell**. Amazing beat'em up, not without a flaws but the game is solid and much better than some modern beat'em ups. Everyone who set it lower than S are just big slow snails who don't make any crowd control. Run a lot, throw enemies often, use every weapon and you'll be fine. Everyone saw Jackie Chan's movies, you know how it works. Of course it is safer to move slower and kill enemies as small groups but it is much more fun to run to the end to gather all the bad boys and make a chaos thanks to enemies' friendly fire. Can watch this forever.

**34: Overbold.** Ultimate Greed Test. Failed miserably tons of times, loved every second of it.

**35: Campanella 2**. Failed miserably tons of times, loved every second of it. Can't find anyhting to hate it. And I'm not even a rouge-like fan. It seems too difficult but fair enough.

**36: Hyper Contender**. I didn't expect it to be the second TMNT TF (NES), may be at least like obscure but fun Fighting Masters (Genesis). Won the gold and didn't come back. Gameplay is fine but something is missing for me.

**37: Valbrace**. I started to use map and guide for the 2nd half of the game. Beat it with lizard bracers and rapier, didn't use magic much. And why it is so complicated to cast spells!? We are not doing MK Brutalities here.

**38: Rakshasa**. Great and challenging platformer. Red birds can go to hell though.

**39: Star Waspir**. Fix wave 3 difficulty and I'll move it higher. Use Grey ship + GGG all the way. If you have a spare life just do a kamikaze kill for the final boss. And kamikaze kill for the 3rd boss from the top doesn't work.

**40: Grimstone**. Too long. I expected it to be more varied in terms of choices (it is RPG after all). Used guide for navigation and I dont' care.

**41: Lords of Diskonia**. Perfect game, got hooked immediately. VS mode rocks.

**42: Night Manor**. It is okay. I wish some tips to solve puzzles were less straightforward. Running and hiding from a monster is a great idea and it adds some replayability.

**43: Elfazar's Hat**. Another action game done right.

**44: Pilot Quest**. It was okay to complete once. Main theme rocks.

**45: Mini & Max**. Masterpiece. Gearface theme brings me to life.

**46: Combatants**. Broken chaos. But I like it for ability to lure spiders to enemies. So vile and fun, haha.

**47: Quibble Race**. I don't understand all this gambling stuff but it is okay and fun to watch.

**48: Seaside Drive**. Just a good arcade shooter with a gimmick. Orcas splashing waves is genius and adorable.

**49: Campanella 3**. At least it is not so difficult as Star Waspir.

**50: Cyber Owls**. Scroll Action is so satisfying, I love all small touches like pushing enemy into trash container, kicking trash bin, scare a cat (don't). Steal Action is fine and quick. The map is easy to navigate. Shooter section is also fun and challenging. Curiosity again, fellows! Riding section is the weakest but very well done.",5,1763375199.0,ufo50,0,0.86,False
