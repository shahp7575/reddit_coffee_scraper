1q02c4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/aquarius/comments/1q02c4b/aquarius_men_and_staring/,Aquarius men and staring,"I met an Aquarius man this year. Initially, I would find myself constantly locking eyes with him, every time I saw him or walked by it's like his eyes gripped onto mine until they couldn't anymore. There was also no smile from him, so I just took them as staring contests. I never understood what the heck was going on.

Later on, I had to move my workstation near his and noticed the eye contact stopped but he would always be staring at me. I've tested things out to confirm he isn't just zoning out (he could be at times), but he would even have his eyes on me when sipping his coffee.

What's also interesting is that he at times would look surprised or stressed when I enter the room. Not sure what I did to make him uncomfortable.

So...after many months of this, I thought...perhaps it's okay for us to talk like normal human beings now! :D So i approached him to attempt small talk... and he was SUPER cold. He gave me one-word answers and didn't seem like he wanted to talk.

I was obviously dejected... and I could've been imagining it, but I think he was observing me for the rest of that day and actually pulled up his standing desk to face me. VERY ODD.

I dunno, I thought he was interested..but maybe not...but then also, why stare so often if he isn't interested. Deep sigh.",1,1767151038.0,aquarius,0,1.0,False
1q02bvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1q02bvw/item_5_kill_the_old_me/,Item 5: Kill the Old Me,"On New Year's Eve, drunk and lonely, I found a minimalist website titled ""The January Manifesto."" It promised to help me become who I was born to be. I laughed, signed the digital contract, and typed out five sincere wishes for the new year:

1. Stop biting my nails.
2. Get a smile that makes people look.
3. Lose 15kg fast.
4. Have an open heart.
5. Kill the old, failed Kaique.

I woke up on January 1st screaming. My fingernails weren't just short; they were gone. Where the nails should have been, there was only smooth, continuous skin. I couldn't bite what didn't exist.

On January 2nd, I fell out of bed. My left leg ended abruptly at the knee. A massive chunk of my right calf was missing, as if scooped out by an ice cream spoon. I dragged myself to the scale. I was exactly 15kg lighter. It wasn't a diet; it was subtraction.

On January 3rd, I woke up with my mouth locked in agony. My lips had retracted and fused near my ears, exposing massive, new, porcelain-white teeth that were too big for my skull. I couldn't close my mouth. I had a permanent, predatory grin.

On January 4th, my sternum cracked open with a wet snap. My ribs peeled back like a bloomed flower, exposing my beating heart to the cold air of the bedroom. I had to wrap my torso in kitchen plastic wrap just to keep the dust out. A literal ""open heart"".

On January 5th, the front door opened.

A man walked in. He was handsome, fit, with a charming smile and manicured nails. He was the Resolution. He looked down at me—a bleeding, one-legged, skin-wrapped monster huddled on the floor—with pity.

""Item 5,"" he said, using my voice, but without the stutter. ""Kill the old Kaique.""

He didn't use a weapon. He pulled a heavy-duty trash bag from his pocket. I was too weak to fight back as he suffocated me.

I woke up this morning feeling fantastic. 70kg, ripped muscles, perfect teeth. I have a date tonight.

I went to the kitchen to make coffee and noticed a smell coming from under the sink. Like meat starting to rot.

I opened the cabinet. Deep in the back, behind the cleaning supplies, there is a large, heavy black trash bag wrapped in duct tape.

I stared at it for a second. I felt a phantom pain in my chest, but I pushed it away. The old Kaique was paranoid. I am not.

Besides, today is trash pickup day. [I’ll take the bag out on my way to work.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q0292f/i_wrote_my_new_years_resolutions_on_an_anonymous/)

1q02blb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moonjewelry/comments/1q02blb/what_type_of_jewelry_is_best_to_use_daily/,What type of jewelry is best to use daily?,"Honestly, the best jewelry for daily wear is the kind you **don’t have to think about**. Something you can throw on in the morning, live your life in, and still feel put together.

For everyday use, **gold-plated and stainless steel jewelry** are absolute lifesavers.

Gold-plated pieces are great when you want that soft, elegant look without wearing real gold every single day. They make even a simple outfit feel a little more feminine and polished. As long as you’re not showering or swimming in them all the time, they hold up really well for day-to-day wear.

Stainless steel is perfect if you’re busy (which most of us are). It doesn’t tarnish easily, it’s durable, and you don’t have to baby it. Think simple hoops, small studs, dainty chains — the kind of pieces you can wear to work, errands, coffee runs, everything.

My personal rule: **stainless steel for everyday basics, gold-plated for when you want that extra glow**.

If you’re looking for cute, wearable pieces that actually make sense for daily life, I’ve come across [**Moonjewelry.ca**](http://Moonjewelry.ca) — they have a nice mix of gold-plated and stainless steel jewelry that’s very “everyday girl” friendly.

My name is Kaique. I’m 32 years old, I work in tech support for a logistics company that will probably be replaced by AI in the next quarter, and I’ve been single long enough for my relatives to stop asking ""any girlfriends yet?"" and start asking ""how is your health?"".

I was sitting on the couch in my tiny downtown apartment, listening to the premature fireworks going off outside. The TV was on the New Year’s Eve special, that show of forced optimism where sweaty singers pretend the coming year will be magical.

I hated it. I hated their hope.

My laptop was in front of me. I was browsing the internet aimlessly when it appeared. It wasn’t an intrusive ad. It was a link on an obscure productivity forum I frequented (ironically, since I was procrastinating my entire life).

The link just said: **THE JANUARY MANIFESTO: Become who you were born to be.**

I clicked. The design was minimalist, almost brutalist. Black background, white font. No ads, no photos of smiling people doing yoga, no promises of ""get rich quick.""

There was only a text field numbered 1 to 5 and a button: **SIGN CONTRACT.**

At the top, a phrase read: *""Change hurts. Permanence kills. What are you willing to sacrifice for the New You?""*

I was drunk enough to find it poetic and desperate enough to take it seriously. I looked at my belly bulging over my belt. I looked at my nails bitten down to the quick, a nervous habit I’d carried since childhood. I remembered my ex, Marina, saying I was ""too emotionally closed off"" before slamming the door.

I decided this year would be different. Not just in theory. I was going to change.

I started typing. My wishes for the new year. A sincere and simple list.

1. **I want to stop biting my nails for good.** (A classic).
2. **I want a smile that forces people to look at me.** (My teeth were yellowed and I smiled with my mouth closed, so having a nice smile was essential for my self-esteem).
3. **I want to lose 15 kilos fast.** (I didn't have the patience for the gym).
4. **I want to have an open heart to the world.** (After all, my ex's criticism still hurt my ego).
5. **I want to kill the old, failed Kaique forever.**

I read the list. It looked like a war plan.

I clicked **SIGN CONTRACT.**

The screen flickered. It didn't ask for an email, it didn't ask for a credit card, it didn't ask for confirmation. Just a message appeared for two seconds before the site went offline and gave a 404 error:

*""The Protocol has been initiated. Happy New Year.""*

I closed the laptop, laughed at my own stupidity for thinking a website would work miracles, finished the bottle of sparkling wine, and passed out on the couch before the countdown.

# January 1st

I woke up with a dry mouth and a pounding headache. The midday sun was coming through the cracks in the blinds, hurting my eyes. I got up, dizzy, and went to the kitchen to drink water.

As I held the glass, I felt something strange. The texture of the glass felt... crooked against my fingertips.

I looked at my hand.

I screamed and dropped the glass, which shattered on the floor, scattering shards and water everywhere.

My nails. They weren't there.

I don't mean they were cut short. I mean... they were gone. Where the keratin plate should have been, there was only skin. Smooth, continuous, pink skin covering the tips of my fingers as if I were a plastic doll or a developing fetus that hadn't grown nails yet.

I brought my hand to my mouth, horrified. The sensation of my tongue passing over the ""blind"" fingertips was nauseating. There were no edges. There was nothing to bite.

I ran to the bathroom. I looked at my feet. The same thing. My toes were smooth, disturbing sausages.

""What the hell is this?"" I whispered to the mirror.

My heart raced. I tried to rationalize. An allergic reaction? A bizarre side effect of some sudden vitamin deficiency? Fungus? But there was no pain. There was no blood. The skin was perfectly healed, as if I had been born that way.

I remembered the list.

**Item 1: I want to stop biting my nails for good.**

Well... technically, it was impossible to bite what didn't exist.

I grabbed my phone to call emergency services. But I stopped. What would I say? ""Hello, my nails disappeared""? They would laugh at me. Or institutionalize me.

I decided to wait. Maybe it was a lucid dream caused by cheap alcohol. I spent the rest of the day wearing gloves, avoiding looking at my hands. The tactile sensation of picking up objects without the rigidity of the nail was agonizing—too soft, too vulnerable.

# January 2nd

I woke up feeling strangely light. Not light in spirit. Light in gravity.

I sat up in bed and, when I went to put my feet on the floor to stand up, I lost my balance and fell shoulder-first onto the carpet. My left leg didn't respond.

I looked down, expecting to see my tangled pajamas. The pajamas were there, but they were empty from the knee down.

The panic was so absolute that my vision went dark. I groped my leg. My left thigh was there. The knee was there. But just below the patella, the leg ended.

There was no blood. There was no open wound. The skin closed into a perfect, rounded, smooth stump, like the end of a sausage cut and healed years ago.

""No, no, no..."" I moaned, dragging myself backward until my back hit the wall.

I pulled up the pant leg of my right leg. A huge chunk of my calf was missing. As if someone had used a giant ice cream scoop and ""dug"" out the meat, leaving only the tibia and fibula bones covered by thin, translucent skin.

I touched my torso. A piece of my back was missing; I could feel the hole. Flesh was missing from my right arm.

I crawled to the bathroom, crying, and weighed myself, supporting myself on the sink. The digital display of the scale blinked.

**70.5 kg.**

Two days ago, I weighed 85.5 kg. I had lost exactly 15 kilos.

**Item 3: I want to lose 15 kilos fast.**

I vomited in the sink. This wasn't a diet. I was being sculpted. Someone—or something—was taking pieces of me to meet the goal. Flesh, fat, bone, muscle... subtracted magically during sleep, cauterized by an invisible force.

I tried to call the police. I dialed 190. The call didn't go through. A synthetic voice spoke in my ear:

*""The contract cannot be interrupted during the processing phase. Please wait for completion.""*

I threw the phone against the mirror, cracking the glass. I was trapped. Trapped in my apartment, trapped in my diminishing body.

I spent the day on the living room floor, a kitchen knife in my hand, waiting for someone to enter. No one entered. The horror was coming from within.

# January 3rd

I didn't sleep. I stayed awake, watching my own body, waiting to see a piece disappear. But sleep overcame me around 4:00 AM.

When I woke up at 9:00 AM, my mouth hurt. A sharp pain in my cheeks and jaw. I tasted copper.

I ran to the cracked bathroom mirror, limping on my single leg. I screamed, but the scream came out gurgled.

My cheeks... had they been torn? No. They had been remodeled. The skin at the corners of my mouth had been pulled back and fused near my ears. My lips were stretched in unbearable tension, exposing all my gums.

I was smiling.

A wide, fixed, maniacal smile, Joker-style, but without the crude scars. It was anatomically impossible, but there it was.

And the teeth. My yellowed, crooked teeth had fallen out (I saw some in the sink drain). In their place, new teeth were growing. White. White as sanitary porcelain. And big.

They were perfect, yes, but they were too big for my mouth. They were predator teeth, teeth made to be seen from miles away. They gleamed under the bathroom light.

**Item 2: I want a smile that forces people to look at me.**

I tried to close my mouth. I couldn't. The lips were too short now. My teeth would be exposed forever. The air dried my gums, causing excruciating pain. I looked like a monster from a bad movie. A one-legged, laughing demon.

I cried in front of the mirror, but the smile didn't fade. I was sobbing, my eyes swollen with dread, but my mouth remained in that mix of eternal, white happiness. The dissonance between what I felt and what I showed was maddening.

I started searching my browser history. I needed to find the site. I needed to cancel. But the history was clean.

I tried to text my sister, asking for help. When I typed ""Help, I need help,"" the letters on the screen changed on their own to: *""I'm great! The process is wonderful!""*

The ""Contract"" controlled my data output. It wouldn't let me spoil the surprise. I was isolated. A prisoner in a tower of flesh.

# January 4th

The pain in my chest woke me before sunrise. It wasn't heartburn. It wasn't a heart attack. It was a cutting pain. Cold and precise.

I looked down. My shirt was open. The buttons had popped off. In the center of my chest, over the sternum, the skin was becoming... transparent. No, not transparent. It was opening.

Like the petals of a grotesque flower, the skin and pectoral muscle were slowly retracting to the sides, curling in on themselves. I wasn't bleeding. The edges of the wound were clean, shiny, and moist.

The sternum bone cracked and split in half. The ribs pulled apart with a wet cracking sound, like green branches being bent.

I screamed, writhing in bed, clutching the sheets with my nailless hands. The smile on my face remained fixed, mocking my agony.

I could see my lungs inflating and deflating. They were pink and gray. And in the middle of them, beating frantically, was my heart.

The tissue around the heart began to dissolve. The organ was exposed. Naked. Vulnerable to the room's air. I could see the arteries, the blue veins, the yellow fat. I could see every terrified beat.

**Item 4: I want to have an open heart to the world.**

The literal interpretation was of artistic cruelty.

I felt the cold air touch the surface of my heart. Every beat hurt, scraping against the open edges of my ribcage. Any dust, any bacteria, any touch there would be fatal. I was a living anatomical doll.

I dragged myself to the cleanest corner of the room. I grabbed rolls of plastic wrap I used for leftovers and wrapped my own torso, crying as the plastic stuck to the exposed flesh and bone. I needed to protect myself. I was too ""open.""

I sat in the dark, listening to the wet sound of my heart beating against the plastic.

There was one item left. The list had five items.

I looked at the clock. It was 11:50 PM. Day 5 was coming.

**Item 5: I want to kill the old, failed Kaique forever.**

The dread I felt in the previous days was nothing compared to the ice that flooded my veins in that moment. The other items were modifications. Tortures, yes, but modifications. The fifth item was a death sentence.

""Kill the old Kaique.""

I grabbed the kitchen knife I kept by my side. If anyone came to kill me, I would take them with me. I dragged myself to the front door, the only access point.

I stayed there, with my giant smile, my heart exposed under the plastic, my missing leg, my smooth hands clutching the knife handle.

I waited.

Midnight.

Nothing happened.

1:00 AM.

Nothing.

3:00 AM.

I ended up falling asleep from exhaustion, leaning against the door, praying the nightmare was over, that the literal interpretation had been ""metaphorical"" this time.

# January 5th

I woke up to the sound of a key turning in the lock.

The sound came from behind my head. I was leaning against the door. The key was being inserted from the outside.

My blood ran cold. I live alone. Only I have the key. The copy is with my mother, who lives in another city.

I pulled away, dragging my mutilated body across the floor, pointing the knife.

The doorknob turned. The door opened softly. The hallway light flooded in, creating a silhouette.

A man entered.

He wore a gray suit, impeccable, tailored. Italian leather shoes. He closed the door gently behind him and turned to me.

The knife slipped from my smooth hand and fell to the floor with a metallic clang.

The man was me.

But not me.

He had my face, but improved. The skin was glowing, healthy, tanned. He was thin—15 kilos thinner than my old self, but proportionally, athletically. He smiled at me. The smile was wide, confident, with perfect white teeth that actually fit in his mouth. A magnetic smile.

He looked at my hands on the floor. His hands had perfect, well-groomed nails. He placed a hand on his chest. I knew, instinctively, that his heart was protected by strong bones, but that he was emotionally charismatic, ""open"" in a figurative way.

He was the New Kaique. Version 2.0. The final result.

And me? I looked at my shredded body on the floor.

I wasn't the client. I was the raw material. I was the cocoon. I was the bio-waste left over after the butterfly emerges. The ""old, failed Kaique.""

The New Kaique walked up to me. He didn't seem disgusted. He had a look of pity, like someone looking at a dog run over by a car that needs to be put down.

""You were very brave,"" he said. His voice was mine, but without the stutter, without the insecurity—projected and firm. ""Thank you for the sacrifice. I'll take it from here.""

""Who... are... you?"" I gurgled through my stretched smile.

""I am what you asked for. I am the Resolution.""

He crouched down. From his suit pocket, he didn't pull a gun. He pulled a black trash bag, thick, industrial. And a roll of duct tape.

""The contract was clear, Kaique. For the new to be born, the old must die. Coexistence does not exist."" ""It's a server space conflict in reality.""

He lunged.

I tried to fight. I tried to scratch him with my nailless fingers, tried to bite with my oversized teeth. But I was weak. Missing pieces. My heart exposed.

He was strong. He pinned me easily. I felt his hands—my hands, but strong—close around my neck. It wasn't a strangulation of anger. It was a shutdown.

As my vision faded, the last thing I saw was my own face, perfect and beautiful, smiling at me while he killed me.

I woke up.

I heard the alarm clock ring. 7:00 AM. I sat up in bed. I took a deep breath. My lungs filled with air without pain. My chest was closed. My legs were there.

I ran to the mirror. I was thin. 70kg, defined muscles. I opened my mouth. Perfect, white, aligned teeth. I looked at my hands. Impeccable nails.

I felt an inner peace, a confidence I never had in my life. An ""open heart.""

I did it. It worked. I am the Kaique I always dreamed of being.

I put on my new suit. I have a job interview today, and I know I'll get it. I have a date with Marina later; I called her and my voice was so charming she agreed to see me.

I walked to the kitchen to make coffee. I opened the cabinet under the sink to get a new filter.

Deep in the back, behind the cleaning products, was a black trash bag, large and heavy, wrapped in duct tape.

It smelled like meat starting to turn.

I stopped for a second. I looked at the bag.

I felt a pang of... memory? An echo of pain in my chest? A ghost of a torn smile?

No. Must be my imagination. The old Kaique was full of paranoia. I'm not like that.

I closed the cabinet door.

I grabbed my coffee, gave my best smile to the hallway mirror, and went out to conquer my New Year.

After all, today is trash pickup day. I’ll take the bag when I go down.

My heart raced. I tried to rationalize. An allergic reaction? A bizarre side effect of some sudden vitamin deficiency? Fungus? But there was no pain. There was no blood. The skin was perfectly healed, as if I had been born that way.

I remembered the list.

**Item 1: I want to stop biting my nails for good.**

Well... technically, it was impossible to bite what didn't exist.

I grabbed my phone to call emergency services. But I stopped. What would I say? ""Hello, my nails disappeared""? They would laugh at me. Or institutionalize me.

I decided to wait. Maybe it was a lucid dream caused by cheap alcohol. I spent the rest of the day wearing gloves, avoiding looking at my hands. The tactile sensation of picking up objects without the rigidity of the nail was agonizing—too soft, too vulnerable.

# January 2nd

I woke up feeling strangely light. Not light in spirit. Light in gravity.

I sat up in bed and, when I went to put my feet on the floor to stand up, I lost my balance and fell shoulder-first onto the carpet. My left leg didn't respond.

I looked down, expecting to see my tangled pajamas. The pajamas were there, but they were empty from the knee down.

The panic was so absolute that my vision went dark. I groped my leg. My left thigh was there. The knee was there. But just below the patella, the leg ended.

There was no blood. There was no open wound. The skin closed into a perfect, rounded, smooth stump, like the end of a sausage cut and healed years ago.

""No, no, no..."" I moaned, dragging myself backward until my back hit the wall.

I pulled up the pant leg of my right leg. A huge chunk of my calf was missing. As if someone had used a giant ice cream scoop and ""dug"" out the meat, leaving only the tibia and fibula bones covered by thin, translucent skin.

I touched my torso. A piece of my back was missing; I could feel the hole. Flesh was missing from my right arm.

I crawled to the bathroom, crying, and weighed myself, supporting myself on the sink. The digital display of the scale blinked.

**70.5 kg.**

Two days ago, I weighed 85.5 kg. I had lost exactly 15 kilos.

**Item 3: I want to lose 15 kilos fast.**

I vomited in the sink. This wasn't a diet. I was being sculpted. Someone—or something—was taking pieces of me to meet the goal. Flesh, fat, bone, muscle... subtracted magically during sleep, cauterized by an invisible force.

I tried to call the police. I dialed 190. The call didn't go through. A synthetic voice spoke in my ear:

*""The contract cannot be interrupted during the processing phase. Please wait for completion.""*

I threw the phone against the mirror, cracking the glass. I was trapped. Trapped in my apartment, trapped in my diminishing body.

I spent the day on the living room floor, a kitchen knife in my hand, waiting for someone to enter. No one entered. The horror was coming from within.

# January 3rd

I didn't sleep. I stayed awake, watching my own body, waiting to see a piece disappear. But sleep overcame me around 4:00 AM.

When I woke up at 9:00 AM, my mouth hurt. A sharp pain in my cheeks and jaw. I tasted copper.

I ran to the cracked bathroom mirror, limping on my single leg. I screamed, but the scream came out gurgled.

My cheeks... had they been torn? No. They had been remodeled. The skin at the corners of my mouth had been pulled back and fused near my ears. My lips were stretched in unbearable tension, exposing all my gums.

I was smiling.

A wide, fixed, maniacal smile, Joker-style, but without the crude scars. It was anatomically impossible, but there it was.

And the teeth. My yellowed, crooked teeth had fallen out (I saw some in the sink drain). In their place, new teeth were growing. White. White as sanitary porcelain. And big.

They were perfect, yes, but they were too big for my mouth. They were predator teeth, teeth made to be seen from miles away. They gleamed under the bathroom light.

**Item 2: I want a smile that forces people to look at me.**

I tried to close my mouth. I couldn't. The lips were too short now. My teeth would be exposed forever. The air dried my gums, causing excruciating pain. I looked like a monster from a bad movie. A one-legged, laughing demon.

I cried in front of the mirror, but the smile didn't fade. I was sobbing, my eyes swollen with dread, but my mouth remained in that mix of eternal, white happiness. The dissonance between what I felt and what I showed was maddening.

I started searching my browser history. I needed to find the site. I needed to cancel. But the history was clean.

I tried to text my sister, asking for help. When I typed ""Help, I need help,"" the letters on the screen changed on their own to: *""I'm great! The process is wonderful!""*

The ""Contract"" controlled my data output. It wouldn't let me spoil the surprise. I was isolated. A prisoner in a tower of flesh.

# January 4th

The pain in my chest woke me before sunrise. It wasn't heartburn. It wasn't a heart attack. It was a cutting pain. Cold and precise.

I looked down. My shirt was open. The buttons had popped off. In the center of my chest, over the sternum, the skin was becoming... transparent. No, not transparent. It was opening.

Like the petals of a grotesque flower, the skin and pectoral muscle were slowly retracting to the sides, curling in on themselves. I wasn't bleeding. The edges of the wound were clean, shiny, and moist.

The sternum bone cracked and split in half. The ribs pulled apart with a wet cracking sound, like green branches being bent.

I screamed, writhing in bed, clutching the sheets with my nailless hands. The smile on my face remained fixed, mocking my agony.

I could see my lungs inflating and deflating. They were pink and gray. And in the middle of them, beating frantically, was my heart.

The tissue around the heart began to dissolve. The organ was exposed. Naked. Vulnerable to the room's air. I could see the arteries, the blue veins, the yellow fat. I could see every terrified beat.

**Item 4: I want to have an open heart to the world.**

The literal interpretation was of artistic cruelty.

I felt the cold air touch the surface of my heart. Every beat hurt, scraping against the open edges of my ribcage. Any dust, any bacteria, any touch there would be fatal. I was a living anatomical doll.

I dragged myself to the cleanest corner of the room. I grabbed rolls of plastic wrap I used for leftovers and wrapped my own torso, crying as the plastic stuck to the exposed flesh and bone. I needed to protect myself. I was too ""open.""

I sat in the dark, listening to the wet sound of my heart beating against the plastic.

There was one item left. The list had five items.

I looked at the clock. It was 11:50 PM. Day 5 was coming.

**Item 5: I want to kill the old, failed Kaique forever.**

The dread I felt in the previous days was nothing compared to the ice that flooded my veins in that moment. The other items were modifications. Tortures, yes, but modifications. The fifth item was a death sentence.

""Kill the old Kaique.""

I grabbed the kitchen knife I kept by my side. If anyone came to kill me, I would take them with me. I dragged myself to the front door, the only access point.

I stayed there, with my giant smile, my heart exposed under the plastic, my missing leg, my smooth hands clutching the knife handle.

I waited.

Midnight.

Nothing happened.

1:00 AM.

Nothing.

3:00 AM.

I ended up falling asleep from exhaustion, leaning against the door, praying the nightmare was over, that the literal interpretation had been ""metaphorical"" this time.

# January 5th

I woke up to the sound of a key turning in the lock.

The sound came from behind my head. I was leaning against the door. The key was being inserted from the outside.

My blood ran cold. I live alone. Only I have the key. The copy is with my mother, who lives in another city.

I pulled away, dragging my mutilated body across the floor, pointing the knife.

The doorknob turned. The door opened softly. The hallway light flooded in, creating a silhouette.

A man entered.

He wore a gray suit, impeccable, tailored. Italian leather shoes. He closed the door gently behind him and turned to me.

The knife slipped from my smooth hand and fell to the floor with a metallic clang.

The man was me.

But not me.

He had my face, but improved. The skin was glowing, healthy, tanned. He was thin—15 kilos thinner than my old self, but proportionally, athletically. He smiled at me. The smile was wide, confident, with perfect white teeth that actually fit in his mouth. A magnetic smile.

He looked at my hands on the floor. His hands had perfect, well-groomed nails. He placed a hand on his chest. I knew, instinctively, that his heart was protected by strong bones, but that he was emotionally charismatic, ""open"" in a figurative way.

He was the New Kaique. Version 2.0. The final result.

And me? I looked at my shredded body on the floor.

I wasn't the client. I was the raw material. I was the cocoon. I was the bio-waste left over after the butterfly emerges. The ""old, failed Kaique.""

The New Kaique walked up to me. He didn't seem disgusted. He had a look of pity, like someone looking at a dog run over by a car that needs to be put down.

""You were very brave,"" he said. His voice was mine, but without the stutter, without the insecurity—projected and firm. ""Thank you for the sacrifice. I'll take it from here.""

""Who... are... you?"" I gurgled through my stretched smile.

""I am what you asked for. I am the Resolution.""

He crouched down. From his suit pocket, he didn't pull a gun. He pulled a black trash bag, thick, industrial. And a roll of duct tape.

""The contract was clear, Kaique. For the new to be born, the old must die. Coexistence does not exist."" ""It's a server space conflict in reality.""

He lunged.

I tried to fight. I tried to scratch him with my nailless fingers, tried to bite with my oversized teeth. But I was weak. Missing pieces. My heart exposed.

He was strong. He pinned me easily. I felt his hands—my hands, but strong—close around my neck. It wasn't a strangulation of anger. It was a shutdown.

As my vision faded, the last thing I saw was my own face, perfect and beautiful, smiling at me while he killed me.

I woke up.

I heard the alarm clock ring. 7:00 AM. I sat up in bed. I took a deep breath. My lungs filled with air without pain. My chest was closed. My legs were there.

I ran to the mirror. I was thin. 70kg, defined muscles. I opened my mouth. Perfect, white, aligned teeth. I looked at my hands. Impeccable nails.

I felt an inner peace, a confidence I never had in my life. An ""open heart.""

I did it. It worked. I am the Kaique I always dreamed of being.

I put on my new suit. I have a job interview today, and I know I'll get it. I have a date with Marina later; I called her and my voice was so charming she agreed to see me.

I walked to the kitchen to make coffee. I opened the cabinet under the sink to get a new filter.

Deep in the back, behind the cleaning products, was a black trash bag, large and heavy, wrapped in duct tape.

It smelled like meat starting to turn.

I stopped for a second. I looked at the bag.

I felt a pang of... memory? An echo of pain in my chest? A ghost of a torn smile?

No. Must be my imagination. The old Kaique was full of paranoia. I'm not like that.

I closed the cabinet door.

I grabbed my coffee, gave my best smile to the hallway mirror, and went out to conquer my New Year.

After all, today is trash pickup day. I’ll take the bag when I go down.

",1,1767150788.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1q028wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q028wa/i_wrote_my_new_years_resolutions_on_an_anonymous/,"I wrote my New Year's resolutions on an anonymous website. Item 3 was ""lose 15kg""","The loneliness of December 31st has a very specific feeling.

My name is Kaique. I’m 32 years old, I work in tech support for a logistics company that will probably be replaced by AI in the next quarter, and I’ve been single long enough for my relatives to stop asking ""any girlfriends yet?"" and start asking ""how is your health?"".

I was sitting on the couch in my tiny downtown apartment, listening to the premature fireworks going off outside. The TV was on the New Year’s Eve special, that show of forced optimism where sweaty singers pretend the coming year will be magical.

I hated it. I hated their hope.

My laptop was in front of me. I was browsing the internet aimlessly when it appeared. It wasn’t an intrusive ad. It was a link on an obscure productivity forum I frequented (ironically, since I was procrastinating my entire life).

The link just said: **THE JANUARY MANIFESTO: Become who you were born to be.**

I clicked. The design was minimalist, almost brutalist. Black background, white font. No ads, no photos of smiling people doing yoga, no promises of ""get rich quick.""

There was only a text field numbered 1 to 5 and a button: **SIGN CONTRACT.**

At the top, a phrase read: *""Change hurts. Permanence kills. What are you willing to sacrifice for the New You?""*

I was drunk enough to find it poetic and desperate enough to take it seriously. I looked at my belly bulging over my belt. I looked at my nails bitten down to the quick, a nervous habit I’d carried since childhood. I remembered my ex, Marina, saying I was ""too emotionally closed off"" before slamming the door.

I decided this year would be different. Not just in theory. I was going to change.

I started typing. My wishes for the new year. A sincere and simple list.

1. **I want to stop biting my nails for good.** (A classic).
2. **I want a smile that forces people to look at me.** (My teeth were yellowed and I smiled with my mouth closed, so having a nice smile was essential for my self-esteem).
3. **I want to lose 15 kilos fast.** (I didn't have the patience for the gym).
4. **I want to have an open heart to the world.** (After all, my ex's criticism still hurt my ego).
5. **I want to kill the old, failed Kaique forever.**

I read the list. It looked like a war plan.

I clicked **SIGN CONTRACT.**

The screen flickered. It didn't ask for an email, it didn't ask for a credit card, it didn't ask for confirmation. Just a message appeared for two seconds before the site went offline and gave a 404 error:

*""The Protocol has been initiated. Happy New Year.""*

I closed the laptop, laughed at my own stupidity for thinking a website would work miracles, finished the bottle of sparkling wine, and passed out on the couch before the countdown.

# January 1st

I woke up with a dry mouth and a pounding headache. The midday sun was coming through the cracks in the blinds, hurting my eyes. I got up, dizzy, and went to the kitchen to drink water.

As I held the glass, I felt something strange. The texture of the glass felt... crooked against my fingertips.

I looked at my hand.

I screamed and dropped the glass, which shattered on the floor, scattering shards and water everywhere.

My nails. They weren't there.

I don't mean they were cut short. I mean... they were gone. Where the keratin plate should have been, there was only skin. Smooth, continuous, pink skin covering the tips of my fingers as if I were a plastic doll or a developing fetus that hadn't grown nails yet.

I brought my hand to my mouth, horrified. The sensation of my tongue passing over the ""blind"" fingertips was nauseating. There were no edges. There was nothing to bite.

I ran to the bathroom. I looked at my feet. The same thing. My toes were smooth, disturbing sausages.

""What the hell is this?"" I whispered to the mirror.

My heart raced. I tried to rationalize. An allergic reaction? A bizarre side effect of some sudden vitamin deficiency? Fungus? But there was no pain. There was no blood. The skin was perfectly healed, as if I had been born that way.

Hi, I am 18 years old and have been with my girlfriend for 4 years now. She's the best thing to have ever happened to me, but recently, she's been really distant. 

Ever since nag ka part-time job sya, nagiging inconsistent na updates nya, to almost no updates at all. She works at a coffee stand, owned by her tita. She would deliver and take orders from people. Her shift also starts at 8am until 11pm, and she usually gets home around 12PM. At first, I was okay with it, I tried my best to understand and be patient. But as time goes on, mas nagiging distant sya and hindi nya nako ma update. 

And this has been going on for 1 month now (this started in December), sobrang dry and cold ng convo namen dahil hindi na sya makapag update and hindi nya na rin ako nakakausap. She wasn't like this, back then, she would always find ways to update me, to talk to me, to spend time with me. I don't know if I'm just being OA or something, but I can't help but overthink, a lot. Halos hindi naren kame nag uusap masyado because of her part-time. 

Dumating yung birthday ko, it was December 25. She greeted me, and we talked, but only for a bit. The whole day, she was out with her family, and that's okay with me. But nung makauwi na sila, it was 11pm na by then, she couldn't even ask me about how my day went, she was cold and uninterested. She couldn't show that she cares, she's just so distant. I didn't get any ""How are you?"" ""How was your birthday?"" She just told me that she's tired and she's going to rest then. She couldn't make time for me, even for a bit, since it's my birthday. 

I've been trying to reach out to her, telling her that I am not okay with our situation and that I can't endure this anymore. She's been really dry and distant for a whole month and she can't update me at all. But all she could say to me was ""I am sorry, once I'm done with my part-time job, everything will be okay"" (She ends her part-time job after the new year), and I can't do anything but just accept it. 

I don't know what to do anymore and honestly, it's been really hard on my side. I've been trying to be as understanding as I can and patient, but I can't help but feel that she's uninterested in me anymore. It's my first time posting in this type of stuff, so if I'm missing some parts in the story, feel free to ask. ",1,1767150591.0,OALangBaAko,0,1.0,False
1q026cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q026cu/my_killer_attended_my_funeral/,My Killer Attended My Funeral,"I’m not really sure how to start this without sounding dramatic, so I’ll just say it plainly: I didn’t know I was being stalked. Not even a little. If you’d asked me a week before I died, I would’ve told you my life was boring in the safest way possible.

I had routines. Everyone does. Same bus, same seat if it was open. Same coffee place because the girl there remembered my name and spelled it right. Same walk home, same shortcut past the closed laundromat even though it smelled weird. I liked knowing where I’d be at any given time. It made me feel solid. Real.

That’s important later.

The first weird thing wasn’t fear. It was absence. Little gaps. I’d swear I locked my door, then find it unlocked. I’d get home and feel like someone had just left, the air still warm, but nothing moved. I told myself it was stress. Everyone does that too. You normalize until there’s nothing left to normalize.

Sometimes I thought I saw the same person more than once in a day. On the bus. Across the street. Reflected in glass. But cities recycle faces. That’s what I told myself. That’s what you tell yourself when the alternative is admitting you might be seen.

The night it happened was stupidly normal. I remember being annoyed about carrying groceries. I remember thinking I should text my sister back. I remember dropping my keys and bending down to grab them.

I didn’t hear him approach.

That part bothers people when they hear it, but it’s the truth. There was no dramatic moment where I sensed danger. No intuition. One second I was alone, the next I wasn’t.

Pain didn’t come all at once. It came in pieces. Confusion first. A pressure that didn’t make sense. The sound I made when I tried to scream didn’t sound human to me, even as it was coming out of my own mouth.

I saw his face for a moment. Not clearly. But I remember thinking how calm he looked. Not angry. Not excited. Focused. Like this was a task he’d already finished in his head.

When the knife went in, it wasn’t like the movies. It wasn’t fast. It was clumsy and wet and wrong. I remember the warmth spreading, soaking through my clothes, my body trying to reject what was happening and failing at it.

The worst part wasn’t the pain.

It was realizing I didn’t matter.

Not in the way I thought I did. This wasn’t personal. I wasn’t chosen because of something I did or said. I was just… available. A space he decided to empty.

I remember choking on my own breath. I remember the taste of blood, metallic and thick. I remember his hand over my mouth, firm but not frantic, holding me still like you’d hold something fragile you didn’t want to break too early.

And then things started slipping.

Not black. Not nothing. Just distance.

I was still there, but not inside myself anymore. I watched him clean up. I watched him wash his hands like he was getting ready for bed. He was careful. Respectful, almost. That’s the word I hate the most.

When he left, he paused in the doorway and looked back at what was left of me. I felt… owned. Like a project he’d finally completed.

After that, time stopped behaving. I followed things instead of experiencing them. My body being found. My name being said in hushed voices. My life being summarized badly by people who loved me but never really knew how to explain me.

The funeral came faster than it should have. Everything does when you’re the one being buried.

The room was wrong. Too bright. Too neutral. My picture on a stand like it was proof I’d existed instead of evidence I was gone. People cried. People hugged. People said the same phrases over and over like repetition might build a bridge back to me.

Then he walked in.

I knew him immediately. Even though I’d barely seen him alive. Recognition doesn’t need details.

He sat where he could see everything. He dressed appropriately. He looked… invested. When people talked about me, he listened harder than anyone else in the room.

When they laughed at a story about me, his mouth twitched. When they got something wrong, I felt this cold satisfaction radiating off him. Like he knew me better now.

He came up to the casket last.

He stood close. Too close. And he whispered, “I’m sorry.”

He didn’t mean it like regret. He meant it like closure.

That’s when it hit me: I was more real to him dead than I ever was alive. My absence had weight. My ending gave me shape. He took something unfinished and made it complete.

And then he left.

He didn’t look back.

I started fading after that. Not all at once. Slowly. Every time someone stopped saying my name. Every time my room got cleaned out. Every time my life got reduced to a memory instead of an active thing.

I’m not haunting him. I don’t follow him. I don’t get justice.

I just disappear.

So if this makes you uncomfortable, good. It should. Because there was nothing special about me. No warning signs. No destiny. Just routines. Just predictability. Just someone deciding the world wouldn’t miss me as much as it did.

And he was right.

The scariest part isn’t that my killer got away with it.

It’s how easily the world agreed.",1,1767150579.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

We got that mug at the beginning of our relationship; one for him and one for me.

I’m looking for someone, anyone (a business, a pottery studio, literally anyone) who can glue ceramic mug pieces back together professionally or semi-professionally. They’re larger pieces and aside from a few super small shards that I couldn’t safely collect, I was able to save the rest.

I realize this is a long shot for a request, but any help or recommendations you have will be greatly appreciated.

I got nervous after seeing a couple of spilled liquid posts, then I almost dumped a cup of coffee in mine. Thankfully just a few drops here and there.

I'm not concerned with the mat affecting wireless charging as I no longer wirelessly charge. For my personal phone I decided the potential heat damage to the battery wasn't worth the convenience. My work phone has a case that interferes with the Santa Fe's wireless charging. This is the first car I've had with wireless charging, so I still have the muscle memory of plugging in a phone when I want to charge. I have two short cables I leave plugged in.

The pictures also show the HVAC controls and button area that have the OCD screen protectors.

I do drink water throughout the day, but I really want a mug to drink hot coffees (lattes, milk based coffees) out of, as well as iced. The 40oz is a little huge to decant a coffee into for the sizes I drink.

I wanted to grab another one and the same design as I love LoveShack Fancy, but the 20oz comes with the sippy straw lid. Obviously not appropriate and I wouldn’t want to get milky coffee in that style of straw, even if heat wasn’t an issue.

My big quencher I have has an opening for a more conventional travel coffee mug sipping experience. Is it the same size for both the 20oz and the 40oz? Could I just swap the lids around?

I’m back here after a while ..I did end up connecting with a few lovely people through my last post. Some conversations even felt promising, but for different reasons, things didn’t turn into something lasting. No complaints, just life being life 🙂

So here I am again, still hopeful and this time, a little clearer about wanting something serious and intentional.

I’m 31, 6’ tall, bearded, and slightly on the heavier side. Born and raised in Delhi, now based in Andhra Pradesh for work. I run my own HVAC spares business and I’m also pursuing my degree again after dropping out of engineering years ago ..closing loops matters to me.

About me:
• Emotionally intelligent, soft-spoken, ambitious, and yes… an occasional overthinker
• Music is a big part of my life ..Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Sufi, old Hindi classics, the works
• I play the drums, love anime, coffee, and deep, unhurried conversations
• Atheist, but respectful of everyone’s beliefs
• Big on kindness, curiosity, emotional awareness, and clear communication

What I’m looking for:
Someone emotionally mature, funny in their own way, and genuinely curious about the world and people. Someone who values consistency over chaos, substance over performance, and calm over drama. A monogamous bond that grows slowly, honestly, and with intention without rushing, but without running from commitment either.

I’m not here out of loneliness or impatience. I just believe that the right person is worth showing up for even on Reddit. If something about this resonates, feel free to say hi. And if not, we can politely blame the algorithm and move on 😄

Marketers would find a loophole, exploit it, and rank high. Then, Google would release an update, patch the hole, and everyone would scramble to find the next trick. But the era of gaming the system is effectively over. The algorithm has matured, and it now prioritizes one thing above all else: credibility.

This shift has brought the concept of EEAT—Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness—to the forefront of digital strategy. It is no longer a ""nice-to-have"" bonus for premium brands. In an internet flooded with AI-generated text and misinformation, Google EEAT has become the primary filter for quality.

If you want your content to rank, and more importantly, stay ranked, you have to prove you deserve to be there. It is not enough to just have the right keywords on the page anymore. You need to demonstrate that the people behind the content know what they are talking about.

# Decoding the Acronym: What Google EEAT Actually Means

To master **expertise authority trust SEO**, you first need to understand the distinct pillars that hold it up. Google’s Search Quality Rater Guidelines offer a deep dive into these concepts, but here is how they translate to practical web strategy.

# Experience (The Newcomer)

Google added the extra ""E"" for Experience fairly recently, and it changed the landscape significantly. This pillar asks: Does the content creator have first-hand experience with the topic?

If you are reviewing a hiking boot, have you actually worn it on a trail? If you are writing about a tax law, have you navigated that law yourself? Experience validates that the content isn't just a summary of other people's work. It adds a layer of authenticity that AI and content farms struggle to replicate.

# Expertise

While experience is about usage, expertise is about knowledge. This refers to the credentials and educational background of the author.

In medical or legal fields, this is non-negotiable. A blog post about managing diabetes needs to be written or reviewed by a medical professional to rank well. However, in other niches, ""everyday expertise"" counts. A hobbyist who has repaired vintage watches for 20 years has high expertise, even without a formal degree.

# Authoritativeness

This is about your reputation in the industry. Are you a go-to source? Do other experts cite your work?

Think of authoritativeness as your digital resume. If Wikipedia, major news outlets, and other industry leaders link to your site as a reference, your authority score goes up. It signals to Google that you aren't just shouting into the void—people are listening.

# Trustworthiness

Trust is the most important member of the family. In fact, Google’s guidelines state that Trustworthiness is the center of the concept. The other three pillars support it.

Trust is determined by the accuracy of your content, the security of your website (HTTPS), transparency about who owns the site, and how easily users can contact you. If Google cannot verify who you are or if your site feels like a scam, no amount of expertise will save your rankings.

# Why EEAT Matters More Now Than Ever

You might be wondering why this framework has suddenly become the buzzword of the industry. The answer lies in the explosion of content volume and the specific dangers of bad information.

# The Rise of Generative AI

Anyone can now generate a 2,000-word article on ""neuroscience"" in seconds using AI tools. While impressive, this content often lacks nuance, accuracy, and human insight. Google needs a way to distinguish between a generic, hallucinated AI article and a thoughtful piece written by a PhD. EEAT is that filter. It acts as a verification badge for human value.

# The YMYL Standard

The stakes are highest for websites categorized as ""Your Money or Your Life"" (YMYL). These are pages that could potentially impact a person’s future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety.

This includes:

* **News and current events**
* **Civics and law**
* **Finance (banking, taxes, investments)**
* **Health and safety**
* **Shopping (ecommerce)**

If your website falls into a YMYL category, **Google EEAT** signals are not just ranking factors; they are requirements. Google’s algorithms are incredibly strict here. A personal blog might get away with a casual opinion on the best pizza in New York, but offering advice on stock market investments requires a heavy dose of verifiable expertise.

# How EEAT Manifests in Real Content

You cannot log into Google Analytics and check your ""EEAT Score."" It doesn't exist as a single metric. Instead, the algorithm looks for a constellation of signals that suggest high quality.

# Author Credibility

The days of the ""Admin"" author tag are dead. High-EEAT content is attached to a real human being. This manifests as a detailed author byline that links to a bio page. That bio page should list credentials, past work, and links to social media profiles like LinkedIn. It connects the content to a verifiable identity.

# Content Depth and Nuance

Surface-level content rarely signals expertise. Articles that provide unique data, original research, or contrarian viewpoints based on experience stand out. Low-EEAT content often looks like a rewrite of the top three search results. High-EEAT content adds something new to the conversation.

# Radical Transparency

Trustworthy sites do not hide. They have clear ""About Us"" pages, physical addresses (where applicable), robust privacy policies, and easy-to-find contact information. If a user feels like they can't figure out who runs the website, trust evaporates.

# Consistency Across the Web

Google connects the dots. If your website claims you are a leading expert on sustainable architecture, but your LinkedIn profile says you are a part-time dog walker with no architectural experience, that discrepancy hurts your trust signals. Consistency between your on-page claims and your off-page footprint is vital.

# Evaluating SEO Trust Signals: How Google See You

Google uses a mix of direct and indirect signals to evaluate whether your site is trustworthy. Understanding these can help you reverse-engineer a better strategy.

# The Role of Backlinks

Backlinks have always been the currency of SEO, but in the context of EEAT, *who* links to you matters more than *how many* links you have.

A link from a government domain (.gov), an educational institution (.edu), or a recognized industry leader (like the New York Times or a major trade journal) acts as a vote of confidence. It tells Google, ""We trust this source."" Conversely, spammy links from low-quality directories can actually hurt your perceived authority.

# User Behavior Signals

If a user clicks your link, stays for ten seconds, and then hits the back button to try a different result, that is a negative trust signal. It suggests your content didn't answer their question or wasn't credible. High dwell time and engagement signal that users found your expertise valuable.

# Fact-Checking and Consensus

For YMYL topics, Google checks your content against the general consensus of experts. If you are a health site claiming that eating rocks is good for digestion, and the medical consensus says otherwise, your trustworthiness will tank. Alignment with established facts is a key component of **SEO trust signals**.

# Practical Ways to Improve Your EEAT

You don't need a PhD to improve your site's standing. Here are actionable steps to build a stronger foundation of trust without overengineering your site.

# 1. Audit Your ""About"" and ""Author"" Pages

This is the lowest-hanging fruit. Every site should have a comprehensive ""About"" page that explains the mission, the company history, and the people behind it.

For your authors, create dedicated bio pages. Do not just write ""John loves coffee."" Write ""John is a certified barista with 10 years of experience managing cafes in Seattle."" Link to his other articles and his social profiles. This creates a knowledge graph entity for your author that Google can understand.

# 2. Leverage Schema Markup

Schema markup is code that helps search engines understand your content better. Use `Person` schema for your authors and `Organization` schema for your business. This explicitly tells Google’s bots: ""This is the author, these are their credentials, and this is the publisher."" It removes the guesswork for the algorithm.

# 3. Show Your Work (Citations)

When you make a claim, back it up. Link to primary sources, studies, and data. If you are writing about finance, link to the SEC or relevant financial reports. External linking to high-authority sites doesn't bleed your ""link juice""—it shows you have done your research. It associates your content with the authoritative neighborhood of the internet.

# 4. Humanize Your Reviews

If you review products, prove you used them. Include original photos of the product in your hands (not just stock photos). Describe the sensory details—the weight, the texture, the setup process. These unique, experiential details are gold for the ""Experience"" part of EEAT.

# 5. Update Content Regularly

Information decay destroys trust. A medical article from 2018 is likely outdated. A ""Best Laptops"" guide from 2021 is useless today. Regularly auditing and updating your content shows Google that you are maintaining your library and that your information is current.

# 6. Manage Your Off-Page Reputation

Pay attention to what people say about you elsewhere. Encourage happy customers to leave reviews on Google Business Profile, Trustpilot, or industry-specific directories. Respond to negative reviews professionally. Google reads these. A brand with a 1.5-star rating across the web will struggle to rank for competitive terms, regardless of how good their blog posts are.

# The Long-Term Value of Credibility

Implementing a robust EEAT strategy is not a quick fix. You will not see your traffic double overnight because you updated an author bio. It is a long-term play for stability.

Websites that ignore these signals are building on sand. They might rank for a while, but they are one algorithm update away from disappearing. By investing in **expertise authority trust SEO**, you are building on bedrock. You are insulating your site against future updates because you are giving Google exactly what it wants: a safe, reliable, and helpful experience for the user.

As search engines continue to evolve, the technical tricks will fade, but the value of genuine human insight will only increase. Start building that trust today, and your SEO performance will thank you tomorrow.

As I think about the future, I lean into things I do every day. For instance, each day I ground myself through journaling, it’s how I start my day—-black coffee and write down my thoughts. 

That’s when it hit me. What if I could write down my thoughts, opinions, and experiences into an app, that eventually could become a LLM I “give” my children. To be clear, it’ll never be you, but it’s meant to be an AI digital avatar that your loved ones can chat with after you pass.

Been Muslim for 7 years. 

Met my husband around a year or so after I converted. Got divorced a year later and ended up hang a daughter with him. Horrible marriage. 

Moved to a new state to start over. Met my current husband by mistake. Really felt he was a good man with a good deen, and didn’t mind that I was married previously. I wasn’t really interested in remarrying but I felt like Allah had put us in the same place at the same time and I decided to go for it. My family loved him, and we had a beautiful wedding. 

We’ve been married for a year and a half now and I feel like everyday with him is depressing me. I honestly don’t know if can do anything to make him happy. Every small thing I do sets him off. He has no future goals it seems. We have no money. And I personally think he didn’t want to marry a non-Arab (I am white), because our cultures are so different. He’s also an immigrant and has green card status through me, but stated since day 1 that he wasn’t looking for a green card but a real marriage. I also felt like he was looking for a real marriage, but now I’m starting to feel differently. 

I also hate the way he speaks to me. I could be relaxing on the couch, an he says “Yalla… go make me coffee” or “yalla go make me tea”. I just feel like him speaking to me this way has really put me off. I don’t feel like I have a lover, instead I am a servant. 

We rarely have sex, and funny thing is, as a woman, I have an incredibly high sex drive. I even bought lingerie today and showed him, to which he do not seem impressed. 

We do not pray together, nor do we do Islamic activities together. He often even says I know more about Islam than him sometimes. 

Overall, I could go on for hours. I feel really disappointed about the way my love life has gone since being Muslim. When even searching for my first husband, many men would not even give me a chance due to being a convert and being white. The marriage pool for converts is horrendous, and we end up with the worse individuals. 

Sometimes makes me wish I just married within my own culture to a non-Muslim. I feel my life would have been much better that way. But I wanted to do the right thing. 

If I do get divorced again, I have absolutely no interest in ever remarrying. It’s embarrassing enough to be married twice.

I worked at a coffee shop in college and have been trying to replicate good espresso at home. I recently switched to a bottomless portafilter, and despite going through several bags of coffee, I can’t seem to dial things in consistently. Shots swing between too fast or too slow, and flavors are often bitter, burnt, weak, or sour. Occasionally I get a decent shot, but overall consistency has been frustrating. Some shots are bad enough that I don’t feel great after drinking them.

I’m back here after a while ..I did end up connecting with a few lovely people through my last post. Some conversations even felt promising, but for different reasons, things didn’t turn into something lasting. No complaints, just life being life 🙂

So here I am again, still hopeful and this time, a little clearer about wanting something serious and intentional.

• Emotionally intelligent, soft-spoken, ambitious, and yes… an occasional overthinker
• Music is a big part of my life ..Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Sufi, old Hindi classics, the works
• I play the drums, love anime, coffee, and deep, unhurried conversations
• Atheist, but respectful of everyone’s beliefs
• Big on kindness, curiosity, emotional awareness, and clear communication

What I’m looking for:
Someone emotionally mature, funny in their own way, and genuinely curious about the world and people. Someone who values consistency over chaos, substance over performance, and calm over drama. A monogamous bond that grows slowly, honestly, and with intention without rushing, but without running from commitment either.

Before this, we were dating for a couple months and then tried to do long distance for about 4-5 months. He had plans to move to my city, and had a job lined up. Three months before the move, he broke up with me over FaceTime, when I had tickets to see him in a couple weeks for his graduation ceremony. It completely broke me and the reasons he gave me were that he thought we were not compatible and he sees me more like a friend than a partner. I became very cold and cut him off and then we didn’t talk at all over the next 4 months. 

When he moved to my city, he reached out and asked me for coffee where he told me how he wants to get back together and how he’s sorry and made a mistake. He also admitted he was dating someone else over the summer, supposedly starting as a “rebound” right after he broke up with me. It just completely shattered my trust and I was extremely upset when I heard that and I told him I can’t do it because it will never be the same. 

However, after a month I had a change of heart and decided to give in another try since I still had feelings for him so since then we’ve been dating. 

He’s been a good boyfriend to me, reassures me all the time and tells me how much he loves me, tells me I’m his person and he wants to help me get over my feelings on being betrayed. He says he wants to take things further and talks about commitment and engagement but I just feel like I can’t forgive what he’s done. I feel cheated on and I’m worried he’ll do it again. I’m even reluctant to live together even though he wants to and I think it would be the next step in our relationship. 

I’m not sure what to do. At this point I think I’ve given this enough time but I still can’t shake off the deep disappointment I felt towards him. My image of him has been completely changed and I only see him as a flawed person who broke my trust.

We are compatible in a lot of ways, we share the same background, are both from similar schools and have a lot of similarities in how we were brought up. We have a good time together and are very attracted to each other and are both independent and well-rounded individuals. 

With time, I have gained more trust in him but it’s really never the same. Will this solve over time and is it worth considering engagement?

1q01qw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PayForResultsSEO/comments/1q01qw1/why_more_content_wont_save_your_seo_strategy/,"Why ""More Content"" Won't Save Your SEO Strategy","It’s a scenario that plays out in marketing departments every single day. You open your analytics dashboard and see a downward trend. Traffic has plateaued, or worse, it’s taking a nosedive. The mood in the room shifts from optimistic to anxious. The immediate, almost instinctive reaction from leadership is usually the same: ""We need to post more.""

The logic seems sound on the surface. If ten blog posts brought in 1,000 visitors, then surely twenty posts will bring in 2,000. It is a linear equation for a non-linear problem. Businesses scramble to hire freelance writers or ramp up their internal production schedules, aiming to flood their blog with daily updates. The goal is simple visibility. If we throw enough mud at the wall, some of it has to stick.

However, modern search engines don't operate on a ""more is better"" basis. In fact, this knee-jerk reaction to underperformance is often the very thing that cements a site’s failure. Google has evolved far beyond rewarding raw frequency. Today, blindly increasing your publishing volume without addressing the underlying **SEO content strategy** is like trying to fill a leaking bucket by turning up the water pressure. You might see a momentary splash, but you aren't fixing the leak.

# The Myth of ""Content Velocity""

For a long time, content velocity—the speed at which you publish new pages—was a legitimate competitive advantage. Ten years ago, if you could publish faster than your competitor, you could likely outrank them. The internet was less crowded, and search algorithms were hungry for fresh data.

That era is over. We have entered a phase of content saturation. Every industry, niche, and sub-topic is overflowing with articles, guides, and opinion pieces. When you prioritize volume over value, you aren't just adding to your own library; you are adding to the noise of the internet.

The problem with the ""publish more"" mindset is that it ignores the health of the existing ecosystem. A website is not a landfill where you simply dump new URLs. It is a library. If a library is filled with thousands of books with repetitive titles, outdated information, and thin pages, patrons won't be able to find what they need. Similarly, if your site is bloated with mediocre content, search engines struggle to understand what you are actually an expert in.

# How Over-Publishing Hurts Your Rankings

When businesses ignore the nuance of **content quality vs quantity**, they often inadvertently sabotage their own rankings. Increasing volume without a clear plan leads to technical and semantic issues that can drag your entire domain authority down.

# Keyword Cannibalization

This is the most common side effect of the ""more content"" approach. When you force your team to write three articles a week about ""project management software,"" you eventually run out of unique angles. You end up with five different pages targeting the exact same set of keywords.

Instead of having one powerful, authoritative page that ranks #1, you have five mediocre pages fighting for the #10 spot. You are effectively competing against yourself. Google’s algorithm looks at these five pages, gets confused about which one is the ""master"" resource, and often decides to rank none of them highly. You have split your own equity.

# Diluted Authority and ""Thin"" Content

Every page on your site should serve a distinct purpose and offer significant value. When quotas drive production, writers are often forced to stretch thin ideas into full-length articles. This results in ""thin content""—pages that offer little value to the user.

If Google crawls your site and finds that 40% of your URLs are low-value, repetitive, or unengaging, it impacts how the algorithm views your domain as a whole. You are signaling that you are a producer of noise, not a provider of answers. A smaller site with fifty incredible, high-performing articles will almost always outrank a massive site with 5,000 pages of fluff.

# Wasted Crawl Budget

Search engines allocate a ""crawl budget"" to your site—a limit on how many pages their bots will crawl and index during a given timeframe. If you have thousands of low-quality pages, you are wasting the bot's time. They might spend their budget crawling your insignificant posts while missing the updates you made to your most important revenue-generating pages.

# The AI Content Explosion

The temptation to choose quantity over quality has arguably never been higher, thanks to the explosion of generative AI. Tools like ChatGPT and Jasper allow marketing teams to generate thousands of words in minutes. The barrier to creating content has dropped to near zero.

Consequently, the web is experiencing a tsunami of AI-generated copy. While AI is a powerful tool for outlining and ideation, relying on it to mass-produce finished articles amplifies the issues mentioned above. AI models predict the next likely word in a sentence; they do not conduct original research, they do not have unique experiences, and they cannot offer contrarian viewpoints.

When you use AI to scale volume without heavy human editing and strategic oversight, you create ""commodity content."" This is content that looks and sounds exactly like everyone else's. In an ocean of AI-generated sameness, **topical authority SEO** becomes the only life raft. Google is actively tuning its systems to find ""Helpful Content""—material that demonstrates experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). A generic AI article produced just to hit a publishing quota rarely meets these criteria.

# What High-Performance SEO Actually Looks Like

If pumping out blog posts isn't the answer, what is? The shift needs to move from ""production"" to ""architecture."" High-performance SEO is about building a resource that serves the user's intent so well that Google has no choice but to rank it.

# Intent-Driven Content

Before a writer types a single word, you must understand the ""search intent."" What does the user actually want?

* **Informational:** Are they looking for a definition?
* **Transactional:** Are they ready to buy?
* **Commercial:** Are they comparing options?

If you write a 2,000-word guide for a user who just wanted a quick definition, you have failed the intent, no matter how good the writing is. **Blog strategy SEO** is about matching the format and depth of your content to the specific needs of the searcher.

# The Power of Topical Authority

Rather than writing about random topics that have high search volume, successful SEO strategies focus on **topical authority SEO**. This means ""owning"" a specific subject area completely.

Imagine you sell coffee machines. Instead of writing one post about coffee, one about tea, and one about smoothies, you should go deep on coffee. You write the ultimate guide to brewing (the ""pillar"" content) and then support it with smaller ""cluster"" articles about water temperature, grind size, and bean origins. You link all these cluster posts back to the pillar.

This ""hub and spoke"" model tells Google, ""We are the experts on coffee."" It creates a web of relevance that is hard for competitors to break. A site with high topical authority on a small subject will often outrank a giant news site that covers the topic superficially.

# Internal Linking Structure

Volume creates isolated pages; strategy creates a network. A high-performance strategy ensures that equity flows through the site. When you publish a new piece, it shouldn't sit on an island. It should link to your service pages and older, high-authority blog posts. This keeps users on your site longer and helps search bots discover your deep content.

# Content Pruning: The ""Less is More"" Approach

Sometimes, the best way to grow your traffic is to delete content. It sounds counterintuitive, but ""content pruning"" is a secret weapon of many SEO experts.

Conduct an audit of your site. Look for pages that:

1. Have zero traffic in the last 12 months.
2. Have zero backlinks.
3. Are outdated or irrelevant.

You generally have three options with these pages:

* **Update:** If the topic is still relevant, rewrite it to be better.
* **Merge:** If you have three short posts about the same thing, combine them into one ultimate guide and set up 301 redirects.
* **Delete:** If it serves no purpose, remove it (and 410 or 301 the URL).

By trimming the dead weight, you consolidate your authority and show Google that you only maintain high-quality resources. It is not uncommon for sites to delete 30% of their pages and see a 50% increase in traffic.

# Strategic Planning vs. Blind Velocity

The difference between a failing blog and a thriving one usually comes down to the planning phase.

**The ""More Content"" Approach:**

* **Goal:** Publish 5 times a week.
* **Metric:** Number of words written.
* **Tactic:** Find high-volume keywords and write articles.
* **Result:** High output, low engagement, eventual decline.

**The ""Strategic"" Approach:**

* **Goal:** Solve specific user problems.
* **Metric:** Organic traffic, time on page, conversions.
* **Tactic:** Identify content gaps, update existing winners, build topic clusters.
* **Result:** Sustainable growth and high topical authority.

A strategic content plan is boring compared to the thrill of ""blasting out"" content. It involves spreadsheets, audits, and research. But it is the only way to build predictable, measurable SEO growth. It shifts the focus from ""How much can we write?"" to ""How much value can we provide?""

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Is posting daily good for SEO?

Not necessarily. Posting daily only helps if you can maintain an exceptionally high standard of quality for every single post. If increasing frequency leads to a drop in depth or accuracy, it will likely hurt your rankings. Consistency is important, but quality is vital. Posting one incredible article a week is better than posting five mediocre ones.

# How do I know if I have keyword cannibalization?

You can use SEO tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Google Search Console. Look at your target keyword and see if multiple URLs from your site are ranking for it, or if the ranking page keeps swapping back and forth. If Google can't decide which of your pages is relevant, you likely have a cannibalization issue.

# Should I delete old blog posts?

You should not just delete them blindly. Audit them first. If they have backlinks, you don't want to lose that authority. In that case, update the content or redirect the URL to a relevant, newer page. Only delete pages that have no value, no traffic, and no links.

# Can AI content rank on Google?

Yes, AI content can rank, but not simply because it is AI. It ranks if it is helpful, accurate, and satisfies user intent. Google’s guidance focuses on the *quality* of the content, not how it was produced. However, unedited, generic AI content rarely satisfies the ""Experience"" and ""Expertise"" components of E-E-A-T.

# Stop the Churn, Start the Strategy

It takes courage to stop the production line. When traffic is down, the pressure to ""do something"" is immense, and writing new blog posts feels like action. But movement is not the same as progress.

If your SEO is underperforming, the answer is rarely found in the ""New Post"" button. It is found in your analytics, in your audit spreadsheets, and in your customer research. It is found by refining your **SEO content strategy** to focus on **content quality vs quantity**.

Stop obsessing over how many times you hit publish this week. Start obsessing over how well you answered your customer's questions. Build **topical authority SEO** by creating the best resources on the web for your specific niche. Real growth doesn't come from writing more; it comes from writing better, smarter, and with clear intent.

1q01qc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ChasingTheRainbow_/comments/1q01qc7/how_to_help_my_partner_struggling_with_mental/,"""How to help my partner struggling with mental health""","If you found yourself googling ""how to help my partner struggling with mental health"" just know you're an incredible human being. And you're not alone. I was in the same position as you and when I googled those words I was met with mental health hotlines and list of 10 tips that basically suggest you ""just listen, don't judge"". How do you listen when your partner refuses to speak? How do you prompt a conversation when your partner is curled in a ball on the couch unable to move or speak? How long do you stay next to your partner, silent, with a hand on their back in show of support? How long do you stay in the relationship? Is my partner's behavior normal for a depressed/anxious person? At what point is this abuse? Does everyone's depression/anxiety look like this? Is this fixable? What I really needed was to hear from someone who has been in my shoes. And that is why I am writing this post. If there is someone, anyone that can relate to this and find my story helpful, this is for you.  
  
In hopes to remain anonymous I will refrain from using names of people and places. Know we are two successful individuals in our late 20s, early 30s, with amazing jobs, families, and friends. Mental health does not discriminate. Most people in our lives will never know the darkest of struggles we went through, And how I wish the topic was not so taboo. The shame my partner felt for having depression/anxiety meant he wanted as few people as possible to know what he was going through. It was a dark secret to keep. I fell victim to the shame myself. I didn't want to open up to family or friends in fear they would judge the person I loved the most. If it weren't for the consideration of my partner's privacy I would love to tell my story, unfiltered. While this story is largely about the mental health struggles my partner faced, this post is not for the one struggling with mental health, it's for the people supporting their partner with mental health. This is your story too.

For context, I stayed in the relationship for 6 years. The most transformative years of my life. Any 20-something year old female would understand the societal/biological pressure to stay, to make it work, after so much invested time and effort. To so badly want to chalk this up to ""nobody's perfect"" and hope he will find a way to cope, manage the mental illness. And I looked at it as an opportunity to prove to him, to myself, what a loyal and good partner I can be. He will change. If not for himself, then for me. Somewhere between year 2 and 3 of the relationship the mental illness came to a head. He could no longer hold a job. There were nights he would be pulling at his hair constantly, crying in pain, and saying ""I can't take this anymore."" I remember holding him in my arms as he nearly passed out from a panic attack and then rubbing his feet until he eventually fell asleep. It was 4am and it took me 30 minutes to get myself onto the bed and shut the light without a peep so as to not wake him. I woke up the next morning and went to my uncles funeral. So much of what I was going through in my life outside of him was brushed under the rug. A death in the family? A stressful job? It was nothing compared to the heaviness I would come home to every night.

In year 6 I decided to start keeping a journal. He didn't like that I was writing about him. He said he felt like a ""lab rat"" but understood that I needed a way to cope as well. In retrospect, I wanted to hold myself accountable. Years had passed and it felt like we would take 5 steps forward and 10 steps back every few months. I didn't want to blink and have another year go by feeling like i was in the same place as last year. The journal would hold me accountable. 

  
Below are the journal entries:

Tues, May 28 2024

Fell asleep early slept well wasn't feeling great mentally, very irritable

Wed, May 29, 2024

Super tired. Said he was feeling terrible. Irritable but tried to be good. Was not happy about taking me to the bus in the morning. Seemed annoyed when he had to pick me up from the bus but said he wasnt annoyed. Fell asleep on the couch at 9

Thurs, May 30, 2024

Didnt see him since i went to the Mets game after work

Fri, May 31, 2024

We got in a fight. He texted me on his way home from work that he was going to sit in his parents backyard but he was annoyed his brother drank all the alcohol from last weekend. I said go get more he said ""no"". I bring beer from the apartment and he chugged all 4 in 30 min. I brought up him eating 1.5 chocolate bars from the night before and he was triggered and said i should watch what i'm about to say. Wanted me to go home so he can order food cause he doesnt want to eat in front of me. He was clearly up tight and said he wanted to play video games. I said it's beautiful out and its Friday can we go outside? He refused so i left which turned into a fight. We ended up going to the diner together and further fight about him not paying rent. We went home in silence and didn't speak the rest of the night

Sat, June 1, 2024

He pulled me in to cuddle in the morning when we woke up. We had sex he went to the gym and I went to my parents pool with my sister. I stopped at the grocery store on the way home and made dinner. We ate the apartment together and watched a documentary and went to bed. Overall pretty good day.

Sun, June 2, 2024

Thought he was gonna wake up feeling terrible cause it's Sunday but he is surprisingly in a GREAT mood. He's joking laughing smiling. I'm going for a walk and hes going to the gym  


Mon, June 3, 2024

I went to work happy hour. I checked in every hour and came home at 10:30. He had cleaned the apartment, unloaded the dishwasher, folded the towels

Tues, June 4, 2024

Seemed like a pretty good day. He texted me at 6pm and asked if I needed anything from the store he was going to pick up waters for the apartment. I went for a walk when i got home from work and we hung out on the couch. He seemed to have a pretty good day.

Wed, June 5, 2024

He went straight home after work. Said he was going to work out but didnt. I ended up going over there to get outside. We played basketball and his neighbor gave us lettuce from his garden. I had to work when we got back home. Overall he seemed pretty good today. He did mention he needs a vacation

Wed, Jun 19, 2024

Havent been writing because hes been good. I've watched my parents dog the past 5 days so I didnt see him thattt much but he seemed good. Today he seemed okay but texted me ""depression is very bad today I'm sorry""

Fri, Jun 21 2024

Depression and anxiety at a 10. He can barely walk/talk. Feels he's going to pass out. But he went to work today. He's off the next few days.

Sun, Jun 23, 2024

He seems to be back in the ""this career has ruined my life"" phase. He says theres a pattern every 6 months and the career destroys him. Says he blames everyone for pressuring him and me for telling him to pick up more days. He said he knew he couldnt handle it but he listened and now look where he is. He can barely be in the room with family he's constantly pulling his hair and can barely speak.

Wed, Jun 26, 2024

He's had a rough few day. He can barely speak, doing anything is hard. He's constantly touching his hair. He has no appetite. I'm trying to get him to listen to a podcast on people in his field speaking about mental health but he hasn't listened.

Friday, June 28, 2024

He went back to work yesterday. He was debating not going in the morning but I told him he would regret it the second he called out if he did. He texted me during the day saying he doesn't know if he can stay the whole day. He ended up staying. He went to work today too and just texted me that he wants to sit in the yard and drink.

Tues, Jul 9, 2024

He was extremely anxious the week he went back to work. On Wed, July 3rd my parents dog had emergency surgery. He didn't come dts for fourth of july with my family because he was working friday. I didnt care because I'd rather him not worry about leaving early- it's far and he had to work so understandable. Friday he went into work and left because he had a migraine. Saturday he was extremely anxious. We took my dog home in the morning and I wanted him to come see the dog and he didnt because he was anxious yet he went to his brother's gf's graduation party from 4-8pm. I was annoyed he did that and said something to him about it. He said sorry and wanted to come visit the dog on Sunday morning. Sunday morning we slept until 10, got to visit the dog at 11:30 and he was already talking about how long we're staying cause he wants to go to the gym at 1. He is never with my family why cant he just put on a brave face for a few hours? He was extremely anxious and depressed al day. He hasnt gone into work Monday or Tuesday. He's spiriling again. We're talking about him going on medication. He says he needs help making an appt.

\*\* i did not journal again until November. We got engaged in October and what should have been the happiest nights of my life turned into the worst. We got engaged in our apartment. It was perfect. He had dinner planned just us two and then a celebration at a bar after with our family and friends. On the way to the bar he said he was anxious and wanted to take a xanex but didnt. At about 10pm the night is almost over and I could tell something was wrong. His shirt was absolutely soaked with sweat. He looked very drunk but our friends wanted to continue the celebration at another bar. I will not speak of what transpired from there but it was the darkest night of my life. For my own safety and unbeknownst to everyone else I slept at his parents house (the only other people who knew of his struggles) and he passed out at the apartment. I knew I should leave at that moment but I could not fathom breaking off an engagement after less than 24 hours. I woke up to a million congratulations texts and family telling me theyre so happy for me/us. I was a wreck. A broken mess. He eventually admitted to sneaking xanex midway through the night because he felt he was having a panic attack at the bar. He blacked out after that point and had little to no recollection of the events that took place after. I gave him an ultimatum- to stop drinking, and speak with a therapist or I walk away.\*\*

  
Sat, Nov 30, 2024

He spoke with the therapist for the first time by himself on Wednesday. We both took off Wed-Mon and we were supposed to go somewhere but didnt end up planning anything. He was not feeling great Wednesday he tends to get like this when he takes off and has free time to himself. He isnt very talkative and said hes not feeling great because he took off and shouldn't have since he works on commission. He was very upset he didnt work. He hasnt been sleeping well. Thursday was thanksgiving. we were at his familys all day and he was in his phone betting all day and barely spoke or was interactive with anyone including me. He said he needed to win to make up for not working Wednesday and he feels better about winning money. Friday he seemed to be better. We went to the diner for breakfast and then to his house and we're with his nieces all day and he was very playful. He said his heart is doing weird palpatation things. We got in a fight later on about not having sex. He said he has no sex drive from the Paxil which he stopped on Tuesday but he said will take time to get out of his system. He was mad because he doesnt want to talk about it but I ""force him and pull things out of him every 4-6 weeks"". He said youre the one who wanted me to go on meds and now you're mad at the side effects. I tried to call him out for how ridiculous that sounds. He knows he needed to go on meds. He never takes accountability and always blames everything on me. He always likes to call me crazy and say I'm dramatic. That night he woke me up cause he was having sleep paralysis and was saying he felt this fear and barely slept he would wake up every hour. I stayed up with him until he would falll back asleep. Next morning he was nice and thanked me and got a haircut went to the gym. We're supposed to go to a restaurant today for a possible wedding dinner venue.

Mon, Dec 2, 2024

We had a blow up fight Saturday before we went to dinner at the restaurant. He called me before and asked if I could pick him up/drive and I said can't you drive? what if i want to drink? He told me ive been drinking a lot lately more than i ever have, every weekend, even thanksgiving i had to drink. I told him he had balls since the night before i was up every hour consoling him with sleep paralysis and I'm also not the one who has a problem with alcohol. He said I should be supportive and if he can't drink I shouldn't when I'm with him. While I agree with that that's not what he said, instead he had to make it seem like I was out of control. On the way to the restaurant I was very mad and said he should be nothing but a model fiance after everything and instead he's the opposite and that I'm sick of being treated like shit. It's a recurring theme that he feels I have an attitude problem and think i can get away with everything just because things he's done are much ""worse"". In a way i kind of agree with him.

Friday, Dec 6, 2024

He walked in the door cursing because there was a note on the door that said they were coming in to service the apartment unit between 8-10am tomorrow. He's cursing so mad and I say lets be real you weren't going to sleep in anyway and he does ""oh yeah according to you I sleep in til the afternoon every weekend"". He was extremely moody trying to start a fight and then freaking out that his shirt button isnt cooperating. He is literally so mad it looks like he wants to punch something. He said he doesnt want to go to this work dinner tonight.

Thursday, Jan 2, 2025

Had some disagreements about wedding. I want to get married in June. Would like to be pregnant by end of the year

1. Although thats what i want is thats best for us? Prob not prob need to focus on us.

2. A part of me feels like I already delayed my life for him waiting for him to finish school, get through his issues, work, etc.

I'm dealing with a lawsuit, work, and wedding and I'm not good with planning. Finally set on one venue and then he calls and says no that place doesnt have good food.

I wasn't feeling good on NYE. I just wanted him to lay with me until i fell asleep and he couldnt. He was offering to go to the store to get me medicine which was nice but he was crawling in his skin at the thought of getting in bed laying down and cuddling. He also had food on the way which was a sore subject because we had just gotten back from dinner and he's supposed to be eating well. Then next day on New Years day I try and grab him to dance and he is absolutely disgusted wont even try. Hes fighting to get off me. He mentioned no DJ at wedding no first dance which I disagree with. I know we arent having a big traditional wedding just renting out a restaurant with family but still.

Saturday, Jan 4, 2025

Had a conversation last night about how he reacted when I got mad on the phone about him not liking the food at the restaurant (potentially wedding venue). Yes I cursed on the phone I apologized for that and explained why I was frustrated but that didnt warrant his reaction. Cursing and telling me to come bring him the remote downstairs. When he pulled up he was mad he had to get out of the car. When he came in he said I'm not talking about this and then proceeded to make comments and I would make a noise under my breath and he started freaking out saying I'm crazy and I make shit up cause I said I felt like he had a problem with every wedding thing I suggested. Anyway he didnt want to talk about it last night and I said we should. I said his reaction was not okay and I dont deserve to be talked to that way. He was stuck on the wedding venue thing and I was explaining I am not even set on the wedding venue and if we would just talk to me calmly we couldve discussed this. I said he never seems happy, never smilling, everything is always a fight. He said he never smiled the whole relationship and now its a problem? I'm more concerned about us than where when we're getting married. I said we should be having more fun an dhappier and he said how can i be happy living here it's a shoe box I'll be happy when I have a big house. I said thats a problem then because you shouldnt be basing your happiness on materialistic things. We should be happy together. We discussed how I hadn't put much effort into his love language I agreed and said sorry I'm struggling with it since I associate words with actions. He said you can't expect change if you dont change. Which I agreed with. Next morning he wakes up and says we cant go to the appt at the restaurant (potential wedding venue) at 6pm. He said we're never going to make it because I had an appt to try on wedding dresses at 3pm. And I was calmly explaining I talked to the guy at the restaurant  he said he would be there all night and its not like 6pm was set in stone I could call him and tell him 7 if he really wanted me to. He's clearly annoyed and saying he doesnt want to go and that we should just go next weekend. I was saying this shouldnt be a fight. I will make sure my appt does not go past 4:30 and its not like we have plans after we have more than enough time to go there. It's not like we're married to this place its just to see it it's been two years since we've been there maybe we'll hate it. He continues to make comments and he's clearly annoyed. I'm very sick of always fighting.

Tue Jan 7, 2025

I listened to a podcast and feel like there were a lot of similarities. Friends dont like him, he ruined a moment for me (engagement), when he has to go to my family stuff he either doesnt come or he does not put on a good face and looks miserable, cycles - she was saying in the beginning a lot of good then only good after the bad and then eventually not much good.

\*\*On Sat Jan 11 I found out I was pregnant. Despite everything we were going through we were so excited. My sister just did IVF and this meant our babies would be three weeks apart. \*\*

Sun, Jan 19, 2025

he said to me ""it delays my healing when you dont leave me alone""

\*\*I had my first ultrasound in late January and I was measuring earlier than expected. After daily blood draws at the doctor and multiple scans over the next couple of weeks the baby was not growing as expected. It was a medical ""missed miscarriage"". My body was not naturally miscarrying so I needed to have a D&C.""

Tues, Mar 4, 2025

D&C today. Yes he took off he didnt let me forget it and also you can take off two days to get a tattoo but hold it over my head when you have to take a day off for my D&C today? He had only come to one other dr appt with me (the first one). Is you taking me to the D&C the only supportive thing? When we got back I fell asleep for 3ish hours and he was not back yet. He said he would be back in an hour when I texted him and that he was working out. He asked if i needed anything and I asked him for a coffee which he brought me. When he got back he said he needed to get things done on his computer like bills and stuff he doesnt have time to do so I sat at the table with him trying to talk to him but he was focused on that and I let him. I asked him if we can talk about the wedding later after dinner he was apprehensive but said yes. Then he stayed on his computer all night in the bedroom coming up with designs for his new tattoo which I understand he needs to do by Saturday. It was 7pm at this point he still hadnt ordered dinner I kept asking him how is it going did he want to eat and he seemed stressed. At 8 when his food got here I asked if i could talk about wedding/italy and he was nasty cursed that he needed to finish his tattoo design. I explained I was not feeling very supported today once we got back and he says I only focus on the negative and dont talk about all the support he's shown (again I'm thankful but is him taking the day off today really that supportive?) I explained we never get the chance to talk about things only Sundays according to him which is not always true and so when I ask to talk about things in advance and he says yes but then goes back on it it makes me upset because we never have an opportunity. At first he denies it and says we talk everyday. I explaini not about important things. He says he got in a bad mood today from work texting him about things. I said he shouldnt let work affect his personal life and shouldnt bring the emotions home I had to clarify that he doesnt talk about work a lot of ""bring work home"" in the the typical aspect of actually talking about it he just brings the emotions associated with it home. And it shouldnt impact his personal life as much as it does especially on a day like today. He seems like he understood kept saying he didnt want to talk about himself anymore then said ""I'm so fucking fat a tattoo is not going to look good on a fat fuck. I'm getting up at 5 tomorrow. I have too many fucking issues I can't be fixed.""

Thurs Mar 13, 2025

Convo with therapist was perfect timing. Couldnt have been better timing he said the exact words ""i'm crawling in my skin"" twice within the last hour. I continued to hug him tell him I loved him I prayed over him rubbed his back til he eventually fell asleep

Sun Mar 23, 2025

Wed/Thurs he was amazing smiling joking laughing. Friday he made comments about work the next day how he was stressed it was going to be so busy and he wont have time for a haircut and then he has to go straight from work to his cousins. Saturday he gets done with work in a terrrrrible mood because the highway is shut and its saying its going to take 115 minutes to get to his cousins. He ends up turning around and I called and stayed calm and said I'll order you something I'm sure you're starving. He ended up calming down saying thank you but he was still stressed. He got home and was so stressed he didnt go to his cousins when his parents made it there. I was originally going to go to my sisters while he was at his cousins but now that he didnt go I was debating on not going to my sisters and he was stressed about that too. The entire night he was saying how stressed he was and needed 1 glass of wine. He says he read a study that 1 glass of wine takes you out of fight or flight mode. Then hes just irritable and not in a good mood and when we get home I'm at the point where I was patient and nice for 5 hours I cant do it anymore and I try and explain why I needed to go in my room and he immediately gets defensive and then I get angry. And sexually frustrated on top of it. Next day I dont end up going to the concert I was supposed to go to and he was saying how he wants to sleep in. I went to the grocery store at 9am and when i get home hes still sleeping and like grunting at me. And you can tell hes already in a moooood he wont even look at me when he wakes up and then hes like ""I got things to do today so just cause youre home now doesnt mean i can just sit around."" We fight over his tone and he claims his tone is fine ""here we go"" he says. I'm getting extremely frustrated and he admits hes in a terrible mood that cant be fixed nothing anyone can do about it. Then he mentions its already 11am and he hasnt done anything. Meanwhile he WANTED to sleep in hes been saying that for days.

And it's not really a big BIG deal to me, but I wanted to vent anyway. I posted recently that I feared I was going to plateau soon. Shouldn't have said anything, pretty much ensured that I would by jinxing it. 

My trajectory for the last year or more is, that I did a good job from ... oh, roughly November of 2024, through to really starting in January 2025, until November 2025. I lost somewhere around 35 pounds, maybe 30 maybe 40. I'm now in the 175 to 182 range, varying daily. I was in the 210 to 215 range initially. I use the lowest number on the scale that I can get. :) 

So today (and a little bit yesterday, and a few of the other days last week and the week before) I really stopped eating at a deficit. I just returned to that old absent-minded eating thing, with all the holiday snacks and noshes that were lying around. It's the STUFF LYING AROUND that is the biggest problem. Plus the cucumbers are out of season, so my farmer's market finds are less succulent and I have less of them lying in the fridge rotter (crisper) drawer so I eat less of them. 

I'm especially miffed at my neighbor. She brought over these Italian fig cookies, I told her I was trying to lose weight, I lied and said the other people in the house are pre-diabetic, we can't have them. She came in to chat and agreed to give the cookies to someone else, but on her way out, she decided ""oh OK I'll just  ... accidentally on purpose FORGET and LEAVE THEM ON YOUR COFFEE TABLE ANYWAY.""

""Eye contact is everything,"" the expert said. Some doctor. ""65-75% of the conversation? Normal engagement. 75-85? They're interested. 85-95%, Maybe in love.""

I scrolled through ride requests. Most were too far. Gas isn't cheap.

""But 95 - 100? Constant, unbroken eye contact?"" She paused. ""They want you dead.""

The anchor laughed. Nervous.

I turned it off.



First pickup was easy. Guy named Darian. Needed a ride across town.

""Ridr for Darian?""

""That's me.""

""I'm Grant. Hop in. Need the trunk?""

""Nah.""

He settled into the backseat. I pulled out.

""AC? Music?""

""Warm it up. Local classic rock if you got it.""

I turned the knob. The radio crackled to life.

""Welcome to 87.6 where a lot of people with faces for radio came to you \*echo effects\* CAME TO YOU to bring you the best \*echo effects\* THE BEST classic rock of the 90s.""

Bon Jon Bovi came on. ""We certainly did NOT Start the Fire. 

I remember when songs weren't political. Just about good ol things us kids did like arsen. Am I right?

Darian looked at me with a weird look

""Sure I guess""

Darian tapped his foot. Hummed along. Seemed happy.

Most passengers don't talk to me. I sometimes prefer it that way. I drive hundreds of people every week. If they all wanted conversation, I'd go insane. I just drive. Let my mind wander. Keep things quiet. But sometime, I use my charisma to get a good rating and a tip

""You pull any badies lately?"" I said

""How old are you?""

""46... why..""

Darian didn't talk to me the rest of the ride after that

The bar appeared ahead. Neon lights bleeding into the night haze. Darian's grin stretched wider as we pulled up.

""Thanks, man. Great night.""

""You too.""

The door shut. $18.62 hit my account.

I parked in a loading zone and opened the app again.



Next request was from someone named Hailey. Apartment pickup. Not too far.

I accepted it and drove over, already regretting the decision when I saw two girls stumbling down the exterior stairs from the third floor.

""OUR RIDR IS HEEEERE!""

""WOOOO I HOPE HE'S CUTE!""

I sighed and rolled down the window.

""Hi, are you Hail—""

""OMG HE KNOWS MY NAME! I'M FAMOUS!""

""He's not cute. He's old.""

The other girl slapped her arm. ""Don't be mean! He's just our driver. TO THE PARTY DRIVER!""

They piled into the backseat, giggling.

""So. Are you married? Single? It's complicated? My mom is like, desperate for a man.""

I glanced in the rearview. The friend looked mortified.

""You want this driver to date your mom?""

""Divorced,"" I said.

""OHHH. Tell us the details!""

""I'd rather not.""

""Fine. Boring."" She crossed her arms. ""Are we there yet?""

""Three minutes.""

""Can you play music? KOSHA! OMG PLAY ME SOME KOSHA!!! CLICK CLOCK IM OUT OF SOCKS FOOD FIGHT PURE DELIGHT IM GONNA PARTY TILL MIDNIGHT!

I turned on the radio. I kept lowering the volume hoping she would also lower hers. But she just kept getting louder. 

When we finally pulled up to the party house, I was ready to drive off a bridge.

""THANKS! BYE BRETT!""

The door slammed.

I sat there. Breathed.

""Thank fuck,"" I muttered.

My phone buzzed. Another request. I declined it. Needed food. Needed quiet.



The gas station was empty. I filled up the tank, grabbed some meat sticks, crackers, cheese. A bottle of water.

""This is living,"" I said to no one.

I drove to the back of a McDoohickie's parking lot. The same spot I'd been sleeping in for the past three weeks. Put up the cardboard window blinds. Pulled out my pillow and blanket from the trunk. Reclined the seat as far as it would go.

""God If my ex-wife saw this she would be so jealous""

I closed my eyes and passed out within minutes.



*Knock knock knock.*

I jerked awake. Disoriented. I rubbed my face and pushed one of the blinds aside.

A flashlight beam hit my eyes.

""Roll the window down.""

I fumbled for the key. Turned it just enough to lower the window.

Officer McDunnuh leaned down. ""Grant. Morning, buddy. Sleep well?""

""What's wrong?""

""Got some reports. Someone sleeping in their car in this lot. You know I gotta follow up.""

""You told me I was good to park here.""

""I know. And I'm not writing you up. Just doing my job so I can report back. But listen—move when you can. Try to rotate spots. If people see you in the same place every night, they'll keep calling.""

""Yeah. Got it. Thanks, McDunnuh.""

He nodded and walked back to his cruiser.

I packed up. Blinds down. Pillow in the trunk. Blanket folded. Started the car and drove to the only place open this early.



A Breakfast Place.

That's what the sign said. Simple. Honest. I liked it.

""Morning, Genevieve. Usual.""

She smiled. ""Already coming. Coffee?""

""Please.""

I slid into my booth and pulled out my phone. Checked my earnings from the night before.

The TV above the counter was playing the news.

""Just in! In today's segment on top 10 side gigs in Partsmouth, Ride sharing is BOOMING! We have seen a nearly 872% increase in ride sharing just this month! Here to talk about that more is Honcho Bererra""

Grant checks his Ridr app

Balance: $82.17

""Well shit."" 

""So it looks like Anchor man Arthur that we simply do not know why ride sharing is booming! We have a population of 10,000 and are seeing similar ride share numbers as a city with 100,000 people. ""

""Incredible. How did you come to this conclusion Honcho?""

Honcho looks at the screen. His eyes intensify

He puts his hands up in front of his face

One hand clasps his thumb with all his fingers.

The other hand the same. But only the index finger is clasped.

He puts his hands together.... Then pulls them away... Then together... Then away....Then together..... Then he stops.

""Amazing"" Says they Anchor.

I blinked. What the hell was that?

Genevieve set my plate and coffee down. ""Enjoy, hon.""

""Thanks.""

I scrolled through the app while I ate. Found a decent request. Airport run. Good money.

I left a twenty on the table and walked out.

Graves throws a $20 on the table before getting the check

Thanks Gen! Keep the rest! Have a good morning!

Genevivie looks at the $20 and the recipt.

Genevive puts the 20 in the register and puts 2 nickles in the tip jar 

""Ugh."" She sighs.

The pickup was at a Mongomery Cheese hotel.

A man stood on the curb. Perfectly still. Brown suit. Hat in his hand.

I pulled up. ""Good morning. Airport for Mr. Jones?""

He didn't answer. Just opened the door and sat down.

I glanced in the rearview. ""How are you today? Need AC? Music?""

His eyes flicked up.

Met mine in the mirror.

Wide. Unblinking. His entire face frozen.

I looked away. ""Nice suit. Work trip?""

Nothing.

He stared straight ahead now. Didn't move. Didn't blink. Didn't shift his weight.

I turned on the radio. Anything to fill the silence.

Fourteen minutes to the airport.

Fourteen minutes of nothing. No sound. No movement. My hands were slick on the wheel. My heart wouldn't slow down.

Even the divorce hadn't felt this uncomfortable.

Finally, we pulled up to Departures.

""Well. Here we are.""

He stepped out. Put his hat on. Stood on the curb.

And stared at me.

I pulled away. Fast.

""Thank fuck that's over,"" I muttered.

I glanced in the rearview to merge.

He was in the backseat.

Same position. Same stare.

I slammed the brakes.

Whipped around.

Empty.

No one there.

But I saw him. I know I did. That stare. Those eyes.

I sat on the side of the road. Engine running. Breathing hard.

It took twenty minutes before I could drive again.



I pulled into a parking lot. Opened the app.

The notification count kept climbing.

Ride request. Ride request. Ride request.

I scrolled.

1. 2. 3. 4.......

12.. 13.. 14.. 15....

I kept scrolling.

29.... 30.... 31....

31 requests.

Over christmas we got chatting about Bill C9, which is the Liberal's governments attempt to make reading the books of Leviticus, Deuteronomy and Romans Illegal and punisble as a hate crime. 

This is the very first time weve strongly agreed on anything political, both of us agreed its a complete and total clear cut trampling of the right to freely practice your religion, and if it passes we would both seriously consider permanently leaving Canada, and it didnt stop there. 

Surprisingly we agreed that our self defense laws need to change to favor people defending themselves against crime after we got to chatting about a case near me. What happened there was a guy broke into someones home at 3am with a crossbow, homeowner stabbed him with a kitchen knife but the homeowner was still arrested. Most surprisingly, she agreed that our latest gun confiscation is nothing but a gun grab that will do nothing to curb gun crime, because legal guns are extremely rarley the issue. 

Honestly its just refreshing agreeing with someone who couldnt be more opposite without the screaming and name calling, just genuine honest conversation, no gotchas no bad faith points, and not afraid to ask questions and dig deeper. I really wish more people outside of my family were willing to sit down over coffee with someone they disagree with and just, talk. Thats the part of politics i got a taste of during the freedom convoy that made me love politics so much. ",3,1767149086.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

high school, philly area. a major local radio station, wysp, airs 'the comedy hour' every sunday nite. format was hearing a person tuning a radio dial, getting a soundbite/snippet from a commercial, gospel tune, etc., then a comedy bit. everything from spike milligan , abbot and costello, to pryor, and carlin, and everything in between. at the end of the hour, they'd announce the artist's names..never missed a broadcast while i lived there.

so the stiller and meara sketch  they played was a take on sex discrimination in reverse. anne , the boss, comes on to jerry, a truck driver for her company. she tries to force an invite in for coffee and he keeps making lame excuses, she keeps insisting (js: -it's just that i'm a gemini, and i'm on the cusp'. am: 'i don't care if you're a rosicrucian! all i want's a cup of coffee!').

long story short, phil the trucker is actually 'phyllis bataglia' ,a member of 'womens rights now' who transitioned to a male, to become a trucker.

sketch ends w/ meara going 'phil, phil, you need a shave!'. stiller responds 'so do you, sweetie'

any help finding the name of the sketch or an album it's on, if any, would be amazing. been searching for some years now on the interwebs using various quotes etc and no scratch.

I never really had any issues with weight or health until one summer I started eating fast food back in 2018. I did so for a few years and put on weight pretty quickly. Went from being around 180# to being 230# in just a few years. I've since stopped eating fast food, stopped drinking pop (juices etc also), almost completely stopped eating sugary snacks except for occasionally around holidays. I'm not doing anything wildly different than I did when I was 27 now but I'm stuck around 210 - 220# for some reason. Arguably I eat healthier now than when I was in my mid 20's since I'm almost never eating sugary foods and I only drink water, herbal tea and occasionally coffee but for some reason it's just not going. lol 

Seems pretty unfair since younger me binged soda pops, donuts and candy but stayed pretty fit somehow. :P

I am seeing a white female therapist who specializes in cptsd/dissociation. she has lived experience with trauma and i believe it was actually likely worse than my trauma. She is critical of the mental health system and believes discrimination is real.

while i feel she does understand trauma, i don't feel she is a safe person; she seems to jump to conclusions about me (i'm changing the topic or avoiding things) and i don't feel like i'm really listened to. She also seems pretty harsh and too tough for me. Also, she reminds me of my old boss who was abusive, lol.

She has told me I'm sometimes out of touch with reality (but didn't give me examples?). She has told me that I minimize the abuse I had in childhood, while maximizing current issues. I don't believe I do maximize current issues, because I see bad things everywhere, and part of my existence is about picking up hints that people don't like me. She doesn't listen to me when I say that bad things are happening now. Social ostracization, professors or bosses not liking me. It's not maximizing to say everyone hates me, if, when I speak in class, they laugh behind their hands, or in the hallway, they don't even look at me.

She jumped to the conclusion that I think punishment works and that children can be abusers. I do think that I caused much of the family strife growing up, though I probably am a scapegoat, but I was mostly talking about my creative writing projects. I want to write short stories about bad people, weird situations where someone punishes themself, and asks, how much punishment is enough? I wasn't explaining this well in the session, but this would be an absurd story, unearthing, actually, how punishment *doesn't* work. And the story about a child abuser would examine what makes people good or bad (and, in fact, what *is* good or bad?), and the lenses we see people through. I was not actually advocating for punishment. But she sort of became a smart ass, and she was like, ""There are certain facts of life, children can't be abusers, punishment doesn't work, **your ideas aren't interesting or original.""**

I had come to session that day after spending a few nights sleeping in one of the academic buildings on campus as I am having horrible roommate issues, which she is aware of but has offered no help for. She also did not blink an eye when I told her I would sleep at the academic builing. At the academic building, security guards woke me up every few hours and it felt generally unsafe. So I was pretty sleep deprived. This whole spring, summer and fall was a disaster; I was bullied at school, up against a seemingly racist environment, and abused by the mental health system, my brother, and roommates. As a result, for many months, my schoolwork didn't go well and I was unable to think linearly. A few weeks ago, I stockpiled sleeping pills and alcohol. I have been self harming frequently this year and it has worsened.

So I did what I do when facing stress and the hate of the world. I finally snapped. I dressed nicely. I woke up. I told my therapist I was feeling very arrogant, that I would win the next academic award (I won an award for my work last year so it's not a complete fantasy, and I worked my ass off), and that I see no reason why, with hard work, I won't be able to rise to the top of my field.

She was immediately offended by this and said that arrogance is bad, only confidence is good. She dismissively said, ""I'm sure you can win an award.""

I said I was inspired by a famous writer who believes in the somewhat woo-woo idea of the law of attraction/manifesting, and my therapist said sarcastically, ""Oh, I wish things would just fall into my lap."" I said this writer also believes in hard work, and manifesting is just acting in such a way that would befit what you want to become... so... I think it does work, because you're *not* just waiting around for things to fall into your lap.... I don't know why she jumped to the conclusion that I was a lazy fantasist.

Personally, I don't actually know if I am that arrogant in a bad sense of the word; I believe in hard work. Also, if I did not set high goals, I'd be stuck in a suicidal depression with no reason to get out of bed. My arrogance saved me. Also, when people believe you are a second class citizen, someone easy to laugh at, it does take some arrogance to believe that you, in fact, belong and can reach the top of your field. When everything is against you and there is evidence that you are worthless, it takes a lot of effort to get rid of that and rise up. Arrogance has its function in my life. Perhaps, then, what I have is actually confidence, but I'm not sure. I think confidence lacks the daring inherent in arrogance. and time and time again, I've needed to be daring because no one believes me, and no one wants me here at all. It takes arrogance not to be completely eroded. It takes arrogance not to die.

My writing professor actually praised me last year, saying, ""You have the arrogance to believe you have something important to say, and you also question yourself a lot, which means you work to make things perfect."" Perhaps my work as an artist really just means I need to have a different set of values than therapy dictates?

I told my therapist about how I got coffee with a classmate, who began to dissect my work and analyze it through the lens of ""is this a trauma plot, and are trauma plots bad?"" and I told my therapist that I don't view my work through that lens because I want to approach my fiction in a way that is not influenced by outside sources. (I think psychology has no place in fiction, because it draws lines around what's good or bad, right or wrong. It's rigid. In fiction, I think ""trauma"" should simply be called ""pain"". If you tell someone their *life* is trauma porn, it's a dismissal of pain, and fiction is where there should and can be space for pain, space for life to exist, without immediately being shot down).

Her response to this was: **""So you're going to shit all over your classmate?""**

This surprised me because I don't see how I was shitting on my classmate. I said, ""No, I want to be her friend, I just don't want to talk about work with her."" What I should have said was the following, though I still don't understand why my therapist thought I was shitting on her: I think my classmate's work is great, actually. I just want to protect my imagination. I don't want to write in a way where I'm only trying to fit into a certain category (such as writing a piece that could go under, for example a ""Strong Women"" category on Netflix). I don't see myself through that lens and I don't wish to see myself through *any lens at all.* Especially because there are so many preimposed lenses that the world views me through: Asian, Female, queer. I only want to be myself, outside of these labels, because the truth is I've never fit into any label.

here's what I did say: that my struggles and perspective make me interesting, and thus give me an interesting perspective, and that makes my work different; She said that was **""the dumbest thing I've ever heard""** and yet... while I'm at the beginning of my career, there's some evidence that my ethos works. Also, by saying that, she directly contradicted what she said earlier, that **""the only original thing you can bring to your work is what makes you unique/your unique take""**

the final thing that gives me pause is that in talking about family systems and how I couldn't have been the abuser of my family as a child. She said, ""There's hierarchy. I wouldn't go up to a police officer---**even as a white woman.""**

There was no reason for her to bring up race. I felt othered, actually, because I hadn't brought up race and now she's calling attention to our differences. I myself sought this woman out to be my therapist, so I thought we could work together...

She asked me if I believe there is hierarchy. This, to me, feels like an odd way of asking me if I accept that I'm a second class citizen. I do believe discrimination and racism and sexism exist. So I said, ""Sure, hierarchy exists, but if I go around always thinking about how things are rigged against me, I might as well kill myself."" Because I might as well not try, then.

Then a few moments later, I was trying to get into some of the things my parents had been through that might effect me through generational trauma, and I said, ""Well, I don't know, in America...""

And she said, **""Are you going to say I can't understand because I'm an American?""**

That has flummoxed me, because that's not what I was going to say. In fact, I was going to say that my parents from a country that has seen massive instability due to many wars on home soil, years of colonization, generations of people fleeing, widespread poverty, addiction, and gambling due to war and colonization on a level America has not seen, and my parents were starving, etc. So... no, I wasn't going to say she couldn't understand, but I was perhaps saying that my experience *is* different. Yes, there is trauma and  there are horrific things in America, but... I'm pretty sure it is different.

Then I said that in fact I don't know my parents very much so I might as well be from nowhere, and that does make me special and different, as I'm not American, but I'm also definitely not from anywhere I know, as my family's abuse of me meant that I didn't learn any cultural traditions from them.... Perhaps this does fuel my writing, you know?

But I don't know if I said that to appease my therapist into thinking I'm not other.

I just feel weird. In life, people can say anything about my writing and I understand that it's about my writing and not me. But in the therapy room, I'm finding that I am extremely offended that my therapist, who has said she doesn't read fiction, thinks she has the right to tell me whether or not my ideas are interesting. I am not as strong as she thinks and had to cancel our next appointment in order to protect my imagination. She told me it's time to try a new approach to life, but I feel she hasn't even listened to what arrogance does for me, and why I turned to it. She doesn't think about what arrogance means *for me*. She jumps to all sorts of conclusions about me, seems to think I'm not taking therapy seriously, displays rigid black and white thinking, and I saw a glint of hatred in her eye. I'm starting to think she doesn't like me or respect me, and I'm not sure that she is safe.

I'm not sure if I should quit this therapist. She does seem to know about trauma, and I like that she is critical of the mental health field. But she is, frankly, scary, seemingly dysregulated and prone to taking her personal problems out on me, and seems to enjoy gaslighting me into thinking I'm seeing things wrong rather than even taking the time to hear me out. I'm also concerned by what she has said about race, even if she seems well meaning.

I don't want to start over with a new therapist because... she may be the best therapist out there. (if this is the best, then that says a lot about the field). i might just have to keep my work and my immigrant/race issues to myself... and those are a big part of my life...",2,1767148209.0,cptsd_bipoc,0,1.0,False

I have had my driving id for about 7yr already, but beside the first few weeks of having the id where I could drive for 3 hr at the most, it then turned into 1hr and or 1/2 hr at the most. If i drive on the highway, after that amount of time my eyes suddenly wants to  cross each other and or I will almost fall asleep at the wheel. Curvy/ back-ways are the same expect i might just last 1/2 hr more. I have tried all sorts of things to help me last longer, but nothing seems to help. I have tried sleeping right before to make sure i am well rested and i only last 1/2 hr more then normal.  I hate the taste of coffee and tea, so I don't drink it. If i try energy drinks then I just get sleepy and fall asleep quicker. Water seems to be the only thing that keeps me awake, but I have to take a sip every 1-5 mins then I have to stop a lot for bath pit stops. Besides to water if i just chew on like a cracker that also keeps me awake, but I have to contentiously eat like one cracker at a time other wise i just get sleepy. I tried  gum, but that doesn't seem to help like what eating a cracker does. I tried windows down but I like the windows down since I can feel the wind on my face. Ac or the heater on full blast does not work. I tune out audio books and with music I have to have it pretty loud but eventually it makes me sleepy and does nothing. If i am with other people then i can't play the music that loudly or have all the windows down anyways. Also I notice that if i scream or just loudly make any sound like ""AAAaaaaHHHHhhhhhHHHHHH"" then that keeps me awake, but only when I am saying it. When I stop, I only last about 1min or 30 sec after. That idea is for only when I am alone since it would hurt the other persons ear and or be very annoying if i did that with people in the car. Also if I  stop after I feel sleep then get out, move a little then drive, i can last only 1/2 hr or 15 minutes more before having to get out and move again.

Long time lurker, first time poster. Started plunging a couple months back using a 100 gallon stock tank. I'm in Wisconsin so fortunately I can keep it in our 3-season porch and despite varying temps (including a brief below-zero stretch) it generally stays between 38-42 F. I always plunge in the morning, not immediately after waking, but before I do anything that requires more effort than starting the coffee pot. Currently I do not have any type of filtration, pump, etc in the tank. The other day, once I got in I noticed what I can only describe as what looked like the hairs from a kiwi in the water. Looking at the water from above they're not prominent enough to notice unless you REALLY look hard. 

I ordered a pump to keep the water circulating, and also got a chlorine tablet float with some chlorine tablets. Wondering if anyone else has any other suggestions on how I can keep the water as clean (and clear!) as possible. I would like to avoid a complete empty/refill if possible since I don't have access to external hose due to the weather.

Chapter 1

James had never committed a crime before. He scanned the park for witnesses before stashing his bike in a bush and ducking behind it for cover. A shiny new sign reflecting the streetlight read: ""No Trespassing. Property of Suncorp,"" which made his blood boil and burned away any remaining doubts. Even though taking back something that was his hardly felt like a crime, Suncorp made it clear that they wouldn't take it easy on trespassers. A week before, they had pulled a kid out of the barbed wire who had been hanging upside-down for nearly half an hour and put him in a police car instead of an ambulance, and he was just trying to get a soccer ball.

James searched the bottom of his backpack until he felt a pair of wire snips. Heart pounding, he put the blades around the thick wire of a chain-link fence, took a deep breath, and squeezed until his hand shook. It snapped so loudly that he jumped and peeked back over the bush. He quickly made five more cuts in a vertical line, squeezed through the flap, and disappeared into the trees beyond.

The woods were dark, but James moved down the trail with ease. After passing a paper birch, he slowed his pace to check a thin thread he had stretched across the trail, giving a sigh of relief to see that it was unbroken. He stepped over the thread, rounded a corner, and there it was: a wooden treehouse tucked safely in the branches of a giant maple tree.

James ran up to the tree and gave It a hug, pressing his cheek into the rough bark. It had been a miserable month for him and his friend, Maggie, as they sat on the swings, wondering what was happening on the other side of the new fence. He couldn't wait to tell her that they had a way in and that Operation Surveillance could officially begin.

James walked over to a neighboring tree and pulled a hidden line. A rope ladder unraveled and stopped just before hitting the ground. He climbed the swaying ladder up to the treehouse and poked his head inside. It was intact and intruder-free, so he pulled himself up and lit an oil lamp on the table.

Everything appeared to be as he left it: two of every dish sat neatly in the cabinet, his stack of drawings still jammed in a cubby, and several playing cards were still strewn about from Maggie throwing her cards up in celebration after a win. Most importantly, a map of Alaska with pins marking several locations along the northern edge was still hanging on the wall above a locked drawer. James walked over and opened the drawer with a key. He shuffled through maps, news articles, and letters until he got to an article that read: “Wildlife Videographer Missing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge”.

He picked it up and looked at the last known photo of his father dressed in a thick coat with a fur-lined hood and a big smile. His eyes jumped down to the highlighted words: No body has been found.

""I'll find out what happened to you,"" James whispered. He gulped down his emotions, took down the poster, and neatly tucked everything from the drawer into his backpack.

James checked his watch and kept moving. A ladder in the corner took him through a hinged opening and onto the roof. He pulled two cameras out of his backpack and screwed them to opposite corners, pointing down at the ground below. He ran the wires back into the house to a tape-covered cookie tin with an antenna sticking out of the top. A flick of a switch turned on a little green light.

""That should do it,"" he said with a smile. ""We're watching you now.""

James took one last look around before leaving. Every detail held a memory; from the window boxes he made at home with his mother to the chimney crafted with his dad's old coffee cans. Building the treehouse helped keep his mind busy as search parties came back empty-handed. With any luck, the network of cameras he was putting up would record Suncorp breaking the law and get them shut down for good.

He blew out the lamp, slung his backpack over his shoulders, and closed up the treehouse. James found the faint trail that led him deeper toward the pounding machines. Nobody knew exactly what Suncorp was doing or why the County decided to sell them the last remaining forest, but the ten-foot fence and the way they threw money at local workers without telling them what they were building didn't sit well with James.

Ferns brushed against his ankles as he rushed past mature oaks and hickories that towered to the canopy above. The sun began to warm the eastern sky, turning the woods from black to gray. It wouldn't be long before he would lose the cover of darkness, so he picked up his pace. The hammering and grinding grew louder, and work lights began to appear through the trees. He was close to finally seeing what they were building but skidded to a stop after seeing a large white animal disappear behind a shrub ahead.

James crouched low and stared into the understory and listened. Eyes wide, James took a few steps closer. The woods around him were silent aside from Suncorp's machines, so his heart nearly stopped when he turned around and saw a barefooted, shirtless boy standing on the trail next to a frost-white coyote. James almost took off running, but he was trapped between them and the build site. He stayed put and studied the wild-looking boy and coyote, who both scanned him with just as much curiosity. Several minutes passed, and nobody moved.

""Hi,"" James eventually said, breaking the silence.

The boy continued to stare at James, not speaking.

""Are you with Suncorp?"" James asked.

The boy did not like this question and took a step back while the coyote stared at him with piercing blue eyes.

""Wait! Don't go!"" James pleaded.

The boy paused. A sharp metallic grinding sound reverberated through the trees, causing the boy to wince.

""I don't like them either,"" James said. ""I don't know what they're up to, but it can't be good. I'm going to film them, and if they do anything shady, I'll send it out to every news station in Ohio.""

The coyote kept its eyes locked on James while the boy looked deep in thought.

""What is that? Over your shoulder,"" James asked, pointing to a vine with large black flower buds slung across his chest like a sash. ""I've never seen any plant like that.""

The boy looked down at his chest and picked one of the bulbs from the vine. He held it between his finger and thumb for James to see. James stepped forward to get a better look, but the boy released the flower, letting it fall to the ground.

The flower bud hit the ground and exploded into a blinding light, leaving behind a cloud of black smoke. James fell backward onto the ground. He squinted and rubbed away the bright afterimage, only to find that the boy was gone. In a flash, he had vanished into thin air along with the puff of smoke. Feeling uneasy, he turned around and saw the boy standing behind him again, coyote at his side.

""What was that!?"" James shouted

The boy smiled.

""Ha ha, very funny,"" James said, blushing. ""Where did you even come from?""

The boy thought for a moment and reached into a pouch that hung at his hip and pulled out a shiny brown seed the size of an acorn. He held the seed in his palm, wrapped his fingers around it, and squeezed until his hand trembled. James watched in amazement as tiny, thread-like roots grew through the cracks of his fingers and dangled below. A green stem shot up between two of his fingers, sprouting leaves and a feathery purple blossom as it grew. The boy opened his hand to reveal a bundle of roots in his palm, with an exotic-looking flower bobbing on its stem. He held it out for James to take.

James hesitated but then carefully took the flower from his hand. The delicate petals spiraled outward from a central hole that seemed to swallow all light. He held it to his nose for a sniff and was immediately transported to a misty swamp below a rocky waterfall. An unusual bird with black and yellow stripes was drinking the nectar of the same type of purple flower he held in his hand. After drinking its fill, the bird flew off to the window of a house built in the canopy of the boggy forest.

""What the—How did--- Is this where you live?"" James asked as the vision faded.

He opened his eyes, expecting to see the boy standing before him, proud and amused, but there was no one there. No poof of smoke, no blinding light. Just James, the flower, and two bouncing ferns. James ran to the ferns, but the boy was long gone. He wondered whether he should chase after him, but at this point, he had to abandon his plan and get back to the fence before it was fully light outside. James dashed back down the trail, passed the treehouse, and slid through the fence hole. He stitched the hole back up by twisting some wire and biked into the neighborhood just as the streetlights clicked off",1,1767147264.0,writers,1,1.0,False

I was on PESI looking at continuing ed and found some books and courses by her and was curious. I looked into her a bit more and see she apparently promotes coffee enemas. I saw a therapist on Reddit said she made claims about using food to help people get off their psych meds. And now I’m just like …okay. Seems like another healthcare provider thinking they’re a dietitian and saying absolutely ridiculous things. 

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone else has heard of her or what anyone else thinks? I really do not know very much about her, so I could be wrong. I just feel there are a lot of popular healthcare providers, none of whom are registered dietitians, talking about nutrition with such confidence and just enough scientific language to sound believable, yet still questionable things I’ve not heard of. 

I feel like nutrition is so flooded by doctors saying buzzwords like inflammation, hormones, and detox and people just eat that up.

I’m noticing that really small grind changes can swing the cup fast. One click finer and it turns bitter. One click coarser and it goes sour. It feels like there is almost no sweet spot in between where things actually taste balanced.

For context I’m brewing V60 with a medium ish roast at a 1:16 ratio. Water temp is around 205F and total brew time usually lands somewhere between 2:45 and 3:15.

At this point I’m guessing this is more than just grind size, but I’m not totally sure where to look next.

For people who have been through this stage before, how do you usually troubleshoot when a cup swings this hard? Do you focus on pour pattern, agitation, water, or even just letting the coffee rest longer?

Since I last wrote to you we have gotten snow up to my knees and shovelled snow piles from the driveway higher than my head. It stopped for a little while and then starting again not long ago, now it is set to stop in seven minutes and just keep stoping and starting all night. We're in for another 8 mm in the next 24 hours. It is a pretty sight at least. Father and I were going to out to the mall to get a my christmas coat present in a smaller size but as you'd expect, we postponed.

I did a decent job writing today. I wrote 661 words for I'm Still Sisyphus. I swear I would have gotten more done if one little sentence of dialogue didn't elude for over a half hour. I just could not figure out what I wanted to say and how I wanted to phrase it for so very long. Luckily, I did eventually straighten that little sentence out but I am sure I could have written several dozen other sentences in the time it took me. Sometimes that is just how it goes. Now that I am nearing the end of this chapter, I think I am going to start the new outline for the next tonight. I know what I want to happen, it just needs a little reorganizing.

Aside from my writing and the snow, I have a few other small things to share. Firstly, we thought for a few terrifying moments that the microwave has broken. When I went to open it after warming up my coffee this morning, the thing shot out like a boxing glove in a box and then stopped working completely. The screen had these odd lines where the time would be and none of the bottoms worked. I read the manual and it didn't mention any troubleshooting issue anything like it. The last thing we want is to have to buy a new appliance. Luckily, Father suggested turning the breaker on and off and once I did, the microwave went back to normal. No idea what that was about but thank goodness it seems to be settled; knock on wood. Also, mother made a wonderful turkey soup for dinner today. It was the perfect thing for a cold winter day like today. She saved the celery and carrot scraps for the bunnies and birds and I just threw them into the lawn an hour ago. We'll see if anyone comes by for a snack.

Now, I am going to make a coffee and start working on my last chapter outline. The temptation to buy my reward books is clawing at me like a hungry cat. With great difficult I have decided to wait at least until the last chapter is half done. I think I have settled on three books; Sorcery by Terry Pratchet, Katabasis by R.F. Kuang, and Northhanger Abbey by Jane Austin. Wish me enough patience to wait. We are almost there.

So a few days later, I texted her and asked if she wanted to meet up at the local Starbucks our hometown had and catch up, I wanted to see what she’s been up to lately since it’s been a long time.

But alas, she didn’t respond, she only read the message. I have no problem with that, I just took it as a no and moved on.

I am not sure when it showed up, but I only noticed it after a system update. I usually stick to options like ProtonVPN or Windscribe since they are always recommended in free VPN Reddit discussions, so seeing Microsoft offer its own VPN felt unexpected.

I tested it briefly while connected to public WiFi at a coffee shop just to see how it behaved. The connection was quick and I did not notice any slowdown while browsing or checking email. That said, it feels very limited. There is no option to choose a country, no clear details about server locations, and not much explanation about what data is or is not recorded. It feels more like a basic safety layer than a full featured VPN service.

Compared to free VPNs like ProtonVPN, you definitely lose flexibility. Being able to pick regions or use it for location based content is something Microsoft Defender does not seem built for. Still, I can see how it might be useful for people who just want simple encryption when using public networks and do not care about advanced settings.

I am curious if anyone here is actually using the Defender VPN on a regular basis. Does it feel reliable enough to trust long term, or is it just a small extra feature bundled into Windows.

1q00qca,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q00qca/every_month_my_college_goes_into_lockdown/,"Every month, my college goes into lockdown. ""Attention. All Gemini students must be locked in their rooms NOW.""","My college takes star signs way too seriously.

""Is that understood?""

The Dean was lecturing me, and I stared down at my lap, trying to fathom how I had gotten myself into this situation.

Guards stood behind me, as if I were some escaped psychopath.

Every time I shifted, I noticed them snap to attention out of the corner of my eye.

I was supposed to belong here, to find myself.

What I had found was a student body deadly serious about separating students according to the zodiac.

My gaze flicked to an astrology chart on the wall, where the school's least favorite sign had been scribbled out in permanent marker.

The Dean's office was an astrologer’s dream. The Dean herself was my mother’s age, a scowling woman who seemed more shadow than person. 

A projector illuminated constellations across the room, casting her face in eerie white light. 

I had been lazily following Orion across the walls when she finally snapped, and I jerked to attention, my eyes rolling back to her.

""Miss Oliver!""

I nodded, my cheeks burning. 

Orion skimmed across her face, and I found myself mesmerized by how beautiful the star looked.

Her office was fairly cozy, a messy kind of cozy. Books and papers piled around her, empty coffee mugs sat half-forgotten, and star maps were spread across her laptop, their corners stained with coffee.

""It was a mistake,"" I finally said through the lump in my throat.

It wasn’t a mistake.

But it’s not like I could admit that.

For some reason, along with this college’s draconian rules centered around the zodiac of all things, there was one sign in particular that had been outcast.

I turned my attention back to the scribbled-out symbol.

Subtle.

Gemini.

If there was ever a zodiac sign people disliked, it wasn’t Gemini.

I grew up with classmates hating Pisces because no one wanted to be a fish, or Cancer because of the crab. But Gemini?

Gemini was in the summer months, and the constellation, in my opinion, was beautiful.

But not to these guys.

Starting my freshman year, I began to notice how badly Gemini students were treated, especially the guys.

Being a late admission, I was new, along with another kid who, at first, seemed like the class clown. He was friendly enough, introducing himself with a grin.

We were asked for our star signs as an icebreaker, or what I thought was an icebreaker, and he shrugged with a small smile.

""Uh, I think I’m a Gemini?"" he said, sounding unsure, leaning back in his chair.

""Yeah. I was born on June 10th. I’m a Gemini.""

I expected that to be the end of it, but instead I noticed a sudden shift in the air, like he had just confessed to murdering his whole family.

The girl next to him inched away, dragging her laptop with her, while the rest of the class seemed to collectively let out a breath before twisting toward the back of the room.

It was almost robotic, their heads snapping around, eyes narrowing. 

I hadn’t even noticed the four students in the shadows, hunched over their MacBooks. 

The professor’s expression seemed to crumple, his eyes darkening significantly.

""I think…"" He spoke in a sharp breath before seemingly collecting himself. ""You should go join your friends at the back.""

The Gemini kid seemed baffled and a little hurt.

The air was thick, every eye burning into him. I felt like they were looking at me too. The professor's eyes were wide, lips curled, like he might say something. 

But he just shook his head, seemingly gathering himself.

""I'm confused,"" the kid laughed nervously, almost jumping out of his chair when a girl behind him kicked his bag across the floor. He sent her a questioning look.

""Is… is this some kind of joke?""

""Now."" The professor wasn’t even looking at him.

""But…"" The boy tried to laugh. ""It's just a star sign, right?""

""I will not ask you again,"" the professor said stiffly. He didn't move, as if doing so would mean being closer to the boy. 

He folded his arms across his chest. ""If you do not move to your designated seat right now, you're out of my class.""

To my surprise, the boy got up and moved to the back, ignoring students cringing away from him. He didn't speak again, sticking to his assigned group. 

I noticed everyone else had been separated into their zodiac signs.

Leos were at the front, with Sagittarius and Libra surrounding them. The other star signs were harder to make out. 

I thought it was just that class that took the zodiac a little too seriously.

But no.

This thing had spread across campus like a virus.

Students didn't care about their grades or what careers they were going to get. 

Because the star signs at the top of the social hierarchy had the faculty wrapped around their little fingers. 

A Libra girl found out she was no longer compatible with a Scorpio and stopped talking to him.

The entire campus had gone fucking crazy. Including the faculty.

It was only certain star signs that were allowed extra credit and invited into exclusive clubs, while the rest of us were left in the dust. Geminis were either treated like dirt or feared, like they were carrying a contagious disease. 

It was like going back to middle school.

In the sixth grade, I was proud of my star sign. I liked to think I had a secret twin, after learning about the story behind the constellation. Castor and Pollux, twin brothers transformed into Gemini.

I used to draw the twins on the backs of my hands, daydreaming up my very own.

Mina Lucas, a Pisces, called me a two-faced bitch. Because Gemini had two faces. So, I called her an ugly fish.

This was middle school, though.

It's normal for kids to build personalities around star signs.

College students, however, are grown adults.

It was fine to base a crush around a star sign or compatibility. But your whole life? Your social circle and education?

It was bad enough that my classmates were brainwashed by stars, but the professors too? It didn't make sense.

It didn't make sense that my roommate had a mental breakdown the night before because she didn't have anything blue to wear. 

According to her star sign, she had to wear blue to have a good day.

Geminis were either mercilessly bullied by students and professors alike or treated like they were invisible.

I had noticed over the last few days, disgust had turned to fear.

Instead of bullying Geminis, other students steered clear of them.

I saw it contorted on every face, wary of the Gemini sitting near them, and presently, I saw it on my Dean's face.

She was scared of me.

The woman may have seemed in control, but I noticed her finger anxiously tapping on her coffee mug, her gaze flashing to and from the clock on the wall. She was waiting for something, her demeanor tense, eyebrows furrowed.

Every passing minute seemed to unnerve her even more.

""A mistake,"" she repeated my words, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

""Yes."" I didn’t look her in the eye, swiping my clammy hands on my jeans.

What was I supposed to say?

I didn't want to associate myself with what I thought was a trend, a TikTok thing that would fizzle out like everything else. 

But I was staring down at a handwritten letter crumpled between my fists, from an anonymous tattletale calling out my real star sign.

The crossed O's stood out.

Who wrote like that?

I had been hiding under the facade of being a Sagittarius, since Sagittarius and Leo seemed to be the ""It"" signs. 

They stood on some fucking pedestal, ruling over campus like some messed-up clique.

The letter was like a slap in the face. I had half a mind to tear it into pieces. 

I stared down at it, my eyes stinging. This letter told me I didn't belong here. 

It told me that because the brainwashed hive mind on campus had decided to collectively despise the star I was born under, I was something to be feared, like an animal.

""Who *sent* this?"" I managed to get out. I squeezed the paper in my fist.

Dearest Dean,

The passive-aggressive tone made my blood boil.

I would like you to know of a traitor amongst you, a Sagittarius by the name of Oliver, who is in fact a Gemini :)

I am SO sorry for ruining your day :(

Anon.

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. When I looked up, the Dean's glare was pinpointed directly in the middle of my forehead.

If looks could *kill.*

""I don't know what to say,"" I squeezed out.

She hummed. ""Well, you can start by explaining yourself.""

She had to be kidding, right?

No.

When I looked her dead in the eye, this woman was being serious.

""Miss Oliver, I am horrified that you would disguise yourself as a Sagittarius."" She curled her lip. ""As one myself, I should have sensed that our energy was wrong, polluted with your presence. But I let my guard down.""

I slammed the letter down. This woman was certifiably insane.

""Who sent this?"" I asked again, harsher this time.

""That is none of your concern,"" the Dean said. ""You lied, Miss Oliver.""

""About my zodiac sign."" I sucked in a breath. ""It's really not a big deal.""

Her eyes darkened. ""As you will discover, Miss Oliver, it is extremely important that we know where every Gemini is."" Her gaze flicked to her MacBook screen. ""Especially when certain measures have been put in place.""

""Measures?"" I straightened in my seat. ""What kind of measures?""

Her lip curled. ""You are a late arrival. It is your fault for not arriving on time.""

""You're kidding."" I scoffed. I was done. It was one thing for students to behave this way.

But grown adults?

The Dean couldn’t justify it. And even if she tried, she would be declared insane.

I leaned forward, testing the boundaries. I wasn’t surprised when the Dean lurched back. ""Was it a bad experience?""

She blinked. ""I don't understand.""

""A bad experience you had,"" I repeated. ""With a Gemini.""

The words suffocated my mouth, eager to spill out.

After weeks of feeling like I was back in sixth grade, finally confronting the root of the problem felt good.

""Because that is all it is, what you're all unhealthily obsessed with."" I spoke through my teeth now, weeks of repressed anger bubbling over. ""They're just stars. They don't mean anything to anyone, except children.""

""Miss Oliver—""

""See?"" Tracing along the constellation mapped out on her desk, I prodded each static light. To my confusion, it was the Gemini constellation, which was ironic.

I stabbed at the twin stars, Castor and Pollux, and then Alhena.

I nodded to Orion, projected across the wall. ""Stars. They're just stars. Dead and dying planets, or if you're religious, your long-dead relatives. Whatever.""

I pointed at the map crinkled under her MacBook, and the Dean once again flinched, her body angling away from me.

She leaned back like I was contagious. One of the guards started forward, no doubt to grab me, but she shook her head, keeping that professional, if slightly strained, smile.

""There is no need,"" the Dean said sharply, and the guards stepped back. ""Miss Oliver is understandably upset."" She cleared her throat.

""Please vacate your current dorm and move into the old building across campus where we house Geminis without rooms.""

The Dean stood before I could reply. ""I don't expect to see you in my office again.""

I grabbed my bag, rising to my feet. ""You're not throwing me out?""

Her lip twitched. ""We do not suspend Gemini students, Miss Oliver.""

""But what if I want to leave?""

""Because of the measures in place.""

Something warm wriggled up my throat, and I tried to speak, but the guards were already politely shoving me out of her office.

The Dean's words didn’t leave my mind until I was halfway across campus, out of breath and regretting every word I'd spat.

She’d sent me away with a warning and an order to leave my dorm room effective immediately and move into the old building off-campus. I had seen it in passing, a large, crumbling structure that used to be the student dorm.

The door was broken, bars on the windows. There was no way I was staying there. Couch-crashing in a friend's dorm seemed a lot better.

Elle was a Leo and insisted she didn’t care about star signs.

Coming from a Leo, that was rich. She had the full Leo experience.

I was moving into her room later that evening, playing cloak and dagger with the security guards on shift, when the announcement played over the intercom.

""Starting from 8pm, please lock ALL Geminis in their rooms. It is upon us.""

Elle froze, her eyes widening. Until that moment, she had been unusually quiet, the two of us cross-legged on the floor eating Chinese food. I thought she was just tired from classes.

She didn’t react at first. She sent me a sleepy smile, then said she was going to grab beer from the kitchen.

What I didn’t expect was for her to come back wielding one of her mom’s butcher knives. I stepped back, but her eyes terrified me. Her whole body trembled, fingers tightening around the handle.

Her expression twisted with a feral fear I couldn’t understand. ""Elle,"" I bit back a cry. ""Hey. It's me. It's Smith.""

""Get out."" She sobbed through the words. Her ponytail swung as she twisted toward the door. ""Please. I don’t want to hurt you."" She waved the knife wildly, and I raised my arms, my heart catapulting into my throat.

""You have fifteen minutes,"" the voice drawled, and Elle's expression hardened. 

""I repeat. Please lock ALL Geminis inside their rooms immediately and find a safe place. This warning will expire at 5am. Eight hours from now.""

A sudden bang outside set off my fight or flight, doors slamming and running footsteps. I found my eyes glued to the blade in my best friend’s hand. 

They were fucking serious about this.

The Dean really had turned a whole campus of students against one singular star sign.

Elle’s frightened eyes found me, and I lowered my arms. ""Wait, are you going to stab me?"" I took a slow step back towards the door. ""Because I was born in May?"" 

I couldn’t resist a laugh. ""You told me you didn’t care about the zodiac! You said all of this was BS! So, why now?"" 

Another step, and she squeaked. 

""Do you want to fit in, Elle? Are the other Leo’s making you do this?” 

She didn’t respond, and that pissed me off even more.

Elle didn’t know why she was afraid of me, because her head had been filled with crap.

I raised my arms in mock surrender. ""Why are you looking at me like that? Elle, I'm not going to hurt you! When have I ever...?"" 

I didn’t expect to cry, but my eyes were stinging. I could hear screaming, Geminis being attacked and locked up. I risked a step back, and her grip on the knife changed, like she was ready to use it.

""You are brainwashed,"" I said slowly. ""The Dean wants you to be scared. She's crazy, Elle. Like, delusional! She has some crazy vendetta against Geminis, and she's punishing us!""

Elle choked out a cry. ""Last month,"" she spoke through a sob. 

""One of you got into my room,"" Elle shook her head rapidly, squeezing her eyes shut. ""Just leave,"" she squeaked. 

""I’m sorry, Smith. I’ll explain, I promise. But you need to find someplace else, and it can't be here. It can't be tonight.”

She smiled, but her lips were strained, eyes wide. 

When I moved to try and reassure her, she jumped back, like a deer caught in headlights.

She was terrified of me.

""Lock yourself up,"" my friend said softly, and I realized I had lost her. ""But don’t hurt yourself."" Elle sniffled. ""They can climb through the windows and sense light. They follow it. So make sure to turn them off and stay down."" Her expression darkened.

""Can you promise me something?""

I found myself nodding dizzily.

Elle squeezed her eyes shut. ""Don’t look up.""

My gut twisted into tangled knots. ""What?""

Elle's words set something off inside me, but she was already dropping the knife and grabbing me gently, pushing me through the door. 

I was being shoved out into the hallway, my bags thrown in my face, when the alarms started blaring, red lights swarming the hallways.

I saw shadows darting in and out of rooms, others being shoved inside, while retreating figures made for the elevators.

A boy was violently dragged out by a girl and thrown on his ass. At that moment, I stopped seeing students. Kids. I was seeing wild animals crawling backward on their hands and knees, frightened eyes darting for a safe getaway.

A girl ran into me, dropping onto her knees before catapulting into a sprint.

She was caught by three guys who dragged her away, kicking and screaming.

I had no choice.

It was 7:50 when I found myself standing in front of the old building, halfway across campus, the alarms still ringing in my ears. 

The dorm looked more like a boarding house, with maybe two or three floors. The night felt eerily still, a half-moon poking through the clouds.

There was something glued to the front door, a simple white sheet of paper.

On it, scrawled in permanent marker, was: ""NO."" in bold letters.

The O was crossed, I noticed. Which was familiar.

""Five minutes,"" the intercom screeched, and in my panic, I knocked three times.

""Hello?"" I banged again. ""Hey, can someone let me in?""

I swallowed hard. ""I'm a...""

My star sign tangled in my throat when a crash sounded behind me. I twisted around. A group of students were dragging two others, bound and gagged, hauling them into a car trunk.

My stomach lurched into my throat. I turned back to knock again, only for my fists to meet something warm. 

A shadow stood in the doorway, golden light bleeding around him. 

I could barely make out his face, just a mop of reddish curls.

He tugged the paper off the door and held it out. The handwriting was unmistakable.

""No means no,"" he said, and moved to slam the door. I quickly wedged my heel in the way, blocking it.

He tried to shut the door on my foot, and in my panic, I shoved it back in his face.

The guy sputtered but didn’t try again. I made sure not to let my guard down.

“You told the Dean about me?” I hissed. “I’m sorry, did we go back to sixth grade?”

He snorted. “You can talk.”

More screams rang out behind us. I couldn’t resist trying to slip through the gap in the door, but he shoved me back, quick as a whip.

“What?”

The shadow paused, then stepped into the light. I glimpsed narrowed eyes and freckles. I tried to push past him, but he stood stubbornly in the way.

His eyes were hidden by a scuffed pair of Ray-Bans. “Ah, yes, the traitor!” he said, like he’d been waiting for this exact moment. “Hiding in Sagittarius, thinking we wouldn’t notice.” He cocked his head. “How’s that working out for ya?”

I heard laughter behind him.

Looking closer, I noticed something metal clamped around his wrist.

Was he... chained up?

“Traitor?” I managed to say.

He nodded with a grin. I had no doubt he’d stood in front of a mirror rehearsing these lines. It was either that, or he was a psychopath.

“The secret Gemini,” he said, making a huge show of blocking my way. “You’re actually famous around here! We turned your room into a relaxation lounge, so unfortunately...” 

He dragged out the “ey” sound like he was auditioning for The Joker. “There’s no room at the inn, dude.”

His lips curled into a spiteful smile. Behind me, another crash echoed.

Ice shot down my spine. I couldn’t bring myself to turn, to witness more brutality. The guy stiffened, but if he was scared, he didn’t show it.

He had too much pride. He hiked his glasses up his nose, revealing eyes shadowed by an eerie glow spreading across his pupils. 

For a moment, I thought I saw hurt crumple his expression, but in the blink of an eye it was gone, replaced with a surprisingly convincing façade.

His gaze followed mine.

Another kid was being mercilessly dragged across the parking lot.

When I turned back to him, his expression had darkened.

He slid his glasses back into place with emphasis. 

I swore this guy thought he was in fucking Glee. 

“Have fun locking yourself up,” he said, saluting me with two fingers before stepping back. Another jingle, and he flinched. 

This time, I saw it clearly, a rusted chain wrapped around his ankle and right wrist. 

He noticed me staring, and his lips curled into a scowl. The kid stepped behind the door, clearly embarrassed.

“This is your two-minute warning,” the intercom blared, still loud even halfway across the grounds.

Hearing the announcement, the guy gently kicked my foot out of the way, and I almost fell on my ass.

I could hear voices as I shuffled back. I checked my phone.

7:58.

Fuck.

“Wait,” I managed to hiss out.

He stopped for a moment, letting out a sigh.

“It wasn't hard to just accept your star sign,” he grumbled. “The rest of this school are psychos, but we take care of our own.”

“It's a *star sign*!” I gritted out. “Why are you going along with this?”

His jaw clenched. “You should go,” he hesitated. “The top floor is usually safe. Head to the girls' bathroom and lock yourself up.”

“You're fucking insane!”

I think part of me was hoping he was just trying to scare me, and then drag me inside at the last moment. 

But no, this kid really was throwing me to the animals.

The guy shrugged. “Yeah…” He shot me a grin. “Byeeeeee!” he said, slamming the door a little too hard in my face.

“Asshole!” I yelled, kicking the door. 

*“You shouldn't have sided with the Leo’s!”* He rebuttaled. 

Across campus, the warning lights were still flashing.

*“Why did you do that?”*

Another guy’s voice hissed from behind the door.

*“Because she’s a traitor.”*

*“Yeah, but she’s stuck out there,” a girl joined in. “Aren’t you being a little too harsh?”*

*“Nope. She can sit out there and rot.”*

I left them to argue and made my way back onto campus.

7:59.

Bathroom.

That was all I could think of. I started toward the main building when movement flashed in the corner of my eye. I saw them pouring out from campus, illuminated in brilliant orange from the torches in their hands.

Leos.

I recognized several faces from my class. They moved as one, a large group heading across campus toward the clearing in the woods.

They wore pajamas, normal clothes, like they were going to hang out.

But something in the air, prickling across my skin, told me different.

There were exclusive clubs on campus, but this was on a whole other level.

I ducked, mapping a way to get on campus without being caught.

If I could get to the door and make a clean break through the cafeteria, I could dive into the girls' bathroom next to the elevator.

I dropped to my knees, attempting to crawl, when I saw her.

The bright red hair was a giveaway, her bobbing ponytail frenzied as she joined the others.

Elle.

Another frantic look at my phone.

8:02.

I didn’t expect her to see me. She was looking around frantically, unlike the others whose eyes were set forward. It looked like she was searching for a way out, staggering over uneven ground.

Then her eyes found mine. 

Initially, Elle looked relieved, and then her gaze went to the sky, flicking back to me. She strayed back, before stumbling over, pulling something from her jeans pocket. It was a much sharper knife, the blade glinting under the moonlight cast across the grounds.

“Tell me your name,” she said in a squeak. “I need to know it’s you.”

I had half a mind to question her before I remembered the Gemini boy chained up.

""Smith,"" I gasped out. ""I'm… I'm Smith.""

Elle hesitated. She twisted around, scanning the night, and then turned back to me. Her frenzied eyes searched mine. ""What is my most embarrassing story?""

""What?!""

In two strides, she was holding the knife to my throat, her hand trembling. The steel was cold, and I had no doubt that she wouldn't hesitate to press deeper.

""Say it, Smith. Word for word.""

Behind her, the Leos were gone, with only some stragglers left behind. 

I nodded slowly, trying to ignore the blade digging into my skin. 

This was my new normal.

""You… you had your period in your boyfriend's parents' new car,"" I whispered. ""You still have nightmares about it.""

Her expression crumpled with relief, and she dropped the knife.

""How about mine?"" I urged her.

Elle surprised me with a quiet laugh. ""You barfed tacos all over your crush on your first date,"" she choked out. ""And he never talked to you again.""

I started to speak, but Elle tugged off her jacket, wrapping it around my eyes.

At first, I fought back, but then her hands, and then her fingernails, dug into the bare flesh of my arms. Her touch was reassuring as she dragged her hands up my arms and then grasped hold of my shoulders.

""I told you not to look up,"" her voice came out in an annoyed hiss.

""I didn't,"" I bit back a cry when she dug her nails in further. ""What's happening?""

""I'll explain later.""

""How can you guys tell who is a Gemini?"" I whispered. ""I don't get it.""

Elle didn’t respond for a moment. ""Your eyes,"" she whimpered. ""It's in your eyes.""

""What do you mean by that?""

""Shush,"" Elle muttered. ""Just stay quiet, okay?""

Elle pulled me to my feet, and I staggered blindly, trying to balance myself. ""I'll take you to the bathroom,"" she breathed, shoving me forward. ""But if you tell anyone I helped you–""

""I won't."" I tripped over something, almost falling on my face. The further we went, the more I could sense something… light.

It started as a pinprick behind my eyes, before spreading, light bleeding through the material of Elle's jacket. There was one bright spot of light, and then another, and another.

Speckled illuminations like glitter illuminating the night.

Closer, they told me.

I followed them almost giddily, watching them burn through Elle's jacket. When the sound of thundering footsteps sliced through me, I turned my head, trying to sense where it was coming from.

""What's that?"" I didn’t realize I was laughing until manic giggles spurted from my lips. It was like being high, my thoughts bleeding into cotton candy.

Suddenly, all I wanted was to see the lights. They felt so far away, and yet also like I could reach them, plucking them straight out of the sky. I laughed again, my body a puppet as I reached out and tried to catch them in my palm.

""I said be quiet!"" Elle whisper-shrieked.

""I am!""

I was curious about the light. It was so bright, and I was missing out on fully taking it in. I stumbled again, this time my footsteps tangled. I didn’t hear the voice until it was in my head, a whisper telling me to pull away the blindfold.

It was choking me, suffocating my thoughts and filling me with a taste of her. I saw it, just a glimpse dancing across my peripheral vision.

I had my fingers clawing into Elle's jacket, ready to rip it off, when someone else did it for me.

""Leo. What are you doing out here?""

The voice was familiar, but it was being drowned out.

By its light.

Its song.

""I'm locking her up,"" Elle said shakily.

Darkness made way for light, and I blinked rapidly. I could sense my head tipping back, and then Elle's fingers in my hair, trying to shove my head down.

Blinking rapidly, I saw the Dean of the college, and my best friend's pale face.

And then I saw the stampede suffocated in shadow, silhouettes passing me, ethereal light illuminating otherwise vacant eyes. The lights resembled stars themselves, dancing through the night.

It was the same light that was seeping into me. It felt cozy and warm, already ignited inside them.

I could tell who they were from their attempts to lock themselves up. 

I glimpsed handcuffs around wrists, makeshift ropes still clinging to arms and ankles, duct tape over mouths. 

When my gaze followed the horde, I caught sight of a cuffed ankle, a stray chain trailing behind him, the guy who locked me out. 

He moved slowly, like a zombie. His glasses were awkwardly placed on the top of his head, eyes drowned by that… that light.

I caught a slight wrinkle in his brow. 

When the others matched forwards, he stumbled back for a moment.

*Was he… pretending to be part of the hoard?*

He was a good actor, perfectly mimicking the others. 

His head was tipped back, arms by his sides, eyes forward, unblinking. 

His gaze flickered to me, lips mouthing five single words. 

**Do not fucking look up.**

But I couldn't *not* look. 

The light was teasing me, seeping into me like honey.

It wasn't moonlight. I could glimpse the crescent glowing under the clouds.

Geminis.

They were bathed in it, a swimming glow I wanted to dive into.

All of them.

Where were they going?

Unlike the Leos, their expressions were blank as they staggered along, akin to a crowd of zombies. I remember not being able to concentrate on the Geminis.

Something was holding onto me, winding its way into my brain. 

I felt it reach directly into the back of my head, phantom fingers taking me into its grasp. I didn't mean to look up. I tipped my head back, drinking in the sky above me, and the night that suddenly felt alive. 

In the corner of my eye, the Gemini guy was grabbing his friends, pulling them into the trees. The Gemini horde stopped suddenly, heads tipping back, glowing eyes following suit. I blinked twice. 

Elle was already covering my eyes, and I wrenched her hands away so I could see… clearly.

I could feel it, sense it, consuming me, filling my thoughts with a lulling fog.

""Smith!""

Elle's eyes found mine, and she dropped to her knees. Like she was scared of me. 

I remember her lips had formed the words in breathy sobs. **Don't look–**

Before she could reach up, I blinked again, and this time it was a longer one.

I started toward… something…

It was there. I just had to reach as high as I could.

Then I would be able to… touch it.

Starry eyes surrounded me, but I don't remember being scared. 

Elle's cry rattled in my skull as I felt my body lurch on its own, driven by something else, a sentient thing inside me. 

I could feel my mind filling with fog. It told me to go to sleep, and I did.

When I came to, it was no longer night. Artificial white light buzzed above me.

The first thing I felt was something wet oozing down my chin.

Then… cool porcelain pressed against my cheek.

I was in a bathroom stall, my head stuck down a toilet bowl.

But it was different from waking up hungover.

I felt... filthy.

My body was aching, a striking pain rippling across the back of my head. 

When I lifted my neck slightly, a snapping sound made me jump, like my bones were popping back into place. 

My memory was gone, my thoughts a whirlwind lost to the dark. I could still see Elle's face illuminated in that startling light.

The shadowy horde around me, starry eyes burning into me.

Then there was nothing.

The familiar ice-cold graze of porcelain greeted me when I pried my eyes open.

There was something in my mouth, and I spat it out, expecting stale barf. What I wasn’t expecting was a wet piece of flesh to splash down into the bowl.

It took me several seconds to realize the toilet bowl I had my head down was not empty.

In the flickering light from the broken fixture above me, I saw the glistening red first, spattered on the lid, and when I looked down, on the floor too, staining my knees.

And then I saw all of it. The bulging, slimy red mess sticking from the bowl.

I lurched back, and something was stuck at the back of my throat.

I reached into my mouth, cringing, and pulled out what looked like a mauled finger, skinned of flesh. 

There were only spiky pieces of bone fragments clinging to shredded muscle.

Something inhuman croaked from my lips, and I slammed my hands over my mouth, my gut twisting.

I looked up.

Red.

I looked down.

More red.

Vivid, wet, and recent.

I was covered in dirt and grass stains, my legs bloodied and bruised, half of my hair ripped out.

The walls around me were the same shade, glistening, pooling, disgusting red, dripping and staining every surface.

The lumpy red mass sticking from the toilet bowl suddenly looked less like a mass the more I was looking at it, blinking through the blinding light.

At some point, I screamed, heaving up the rest, wet globules of fat spilling from my mouth. There was a head in the toilet bowl, stuck right under, like I had been trying to hide the evidence.

The head didn’t look like a head, half of its skull crushed. But I could still make out familiar features. Eyes still wide open, lips frozen in what looked like a scream.

The rest of her had presumably been flushed, but I could still see pieces of her clinging to the rim of the toilet.

Elle. 

Oh god, fuck, I killed my best friend. 

I'm still sitting here. I can't bring myself to move. Normal college life still goes on outside, and I can't understand how. 

I found myself back at the Gemini house a few hours ago. It was locked, but there was a small key wrapped in some paper. 

**I was FORCED to give you this, Oliver. Don't touch my stuff. You're sharing with Elena. Don't think this means any of us trust you. Welcome to the madhouse.**

“Coming in?”

The voice startled me. 

I twisted around, and there he was, the asshole Gemini. 

I took pleasure in walking away, dumping both the key and the note in the trash. 

I ask this as a Gemini. 

Preferably on campus, but this goes for all of you. 

Did any of you kill and eat someone last night with no memory of doing so? 

I'm starting to think the Gemini constellation is something more than a group of stars after all. 

I think it's *alive.*",4,1767146593.0,scarystories,0,0.83,False

I'm not sure if it is coincidental or possible that they have gluten (malt? barley?) as a hidden ingredient. I also stopped getting tea beverages from Mercury Coffee (and all other coffee shops because i am kind of traumatized).

the ingredients in the bottled tea i had today are: organic brewed tea (filtered water, organic green tea leaves), organic agave syrup, organic honey, natural flavor, citric acid, ascorbic acid (to protect taste). 

i'm not sure about the ingredients that are in the tea at mercury's so i can't compare. also i drink (certified gf) green tea quite often so i know its not the tea leaves itself. 

i feel like many people are going to say it is hidden in the natural flavor but i never get sick from shared fryers/ovens/toasters and also i ate some danish kringle on christmas and only had some cramping but when i drink these teas i have some real effects... (cramping, bathroom issues, and heightened anxiety). also, i am not diagnosed, i just poop a lot when i eat bread so im really not even sure if it is a wheat issue or a gluten issue but i got sick from my advent calendar chocolates that ""may contain"" wheat. but again, i barely got sick from the kringle and i never get sick when i eat chips from shared fryer. and also when i eat gf pizza  that is cooked in a regular pizza oven i also dont get sick.

I tested TunnelBear first since it is often recommended for beginners and the setup was very quick. I liked that it felt beginner friendly, but the free data limit ran out fast and speeds slowed down once I used it more. It was fine for checking Reddit and reading news, but video apps felt sluggish. After that I tried Windscribe and had a better experience overall. The free plan gave me more location options and the connection felt more stable when switching between apps. I also noticed my battery held up better than I expected.

Hi all, wanted to post an update on what’s happened since Christmas because the boundary-pushing just keeps coming! Tis the Season!! 
Timeline of events:

Christmas cards: Both MIL and overstepping cousin sent cards. MIL specifically addresses mail to only my sons name, hes 4 months old. Basic Christmas card no gift no nothing just signed “with all OUR love grandma and grandpa” in only my MILS handwriting. Overstepping cousin sent a basic xmas card with pic of her husband and kid. I returned all mail and marked “return to sender. no longer at this address”. We still live there but that was the only stamp they had 🤷‍♀️

Christmas Eve: My husband received a text from his sister, SIL husband: “FYI your mom was in hospital. Thought it was something you should know.” We don’t know details, but this was sent without prior conversation or context. Husband ignores clearly shes okay if no context. 

Christmas Day: Overstepping cousin’s sister, we will call her Mary. Who we haven’t seen in 2 yrs in person and again prior to that only once a year if that. Suddenly texts “Merry Christmas, hope the three of you had a great day.” we never even got a congratulations from this woman when we gave birth and my husband didnt even have her number saved bc he has never texted with her in 30 years. She also texted a number I had on an old invitation to one of my showers. In a group text? 
We had no prior relationship but now its merry christmas suddenly, okay? Lol

Day before NYE: Overstepping cousin’s husband, we will call him Mark texts: “Just letting you know our Christmas card was returned to us opened and marked returned to sender. I assume you havent moved, Any clue what happened?” Again my husband doesnt have this number saved and if anything we have a better relationship with the dunkin donuts worker who makes our daily coffee than this guy. He has skipped almost every event and I think ive only ever said Hi and Bye to him and same with my husband, no joke. 

Same day, 2 hours later: MIL emails my husband:
“We are asking for 10 minutes of your time to show you a few things we are not sure you are aware of. We miss and love you.”
Not clear if this is related to the cards or something else. I literally cant think of anything besides just her over dramatizing shit again since the hospital line didnt work. If they are assuming my husband doesnt know we sent those cards back together then they are even dumber than I thought.


Honestly, every new attempt feels like a level in the “How far can I push them?” game. Just keeping a record because some days you need to laugh so you don’t cry. We will keep blocking ignoring till our thumbs hurt but my brain hurts thinking why do these extended family members give a flying F about my business or life? I couldnt tell you anything about them bc I dont know or care. Dont know what the gain is for them, so fucking bizarre. I have a baby? like weird. I dont see you or speak to you lets keep it that way.",43,1767146463.0,JUSTNOMIL,7,1.0,False

Out and About flair. If your one the lucky ones that can come and go as your femme self and are out in the wilds. Shopping at the mall sipping coffee at your favorite spot. Let us see you and use that flair.

Classic Fashion flair. Classic fashion style is defined by timeless, elegant, and simple silhouettes with clean lines, focusing on neutral colors, quality fabrics, and impeccable tailoring (like blazers, crisp shirts, tailored trousers) rather than fleeting trends.

Elegant Evening Wear flair. Elegant evening wear is sophisticated and tasteful attire for formal events, often featuring floor-length gowns made of luxurious fabrics like silk or satin, with details like beadwork or sequins. Key elements include classic colors like black or navy, rich jewel tones, and flattering silhouettes such as A-line or mermaid. 

Casual wear flair. Casual wear is a relaxed, everyday style of clothing that prioritizes comfort and personal expression over formality. It includes items like t-shirts, jeans, sweaters, and comfortable dresses, and can be adapted for various occasions.

Business Style flair. Business wear refers to clothing that is appropriate for a professional environment. Key elements include tailored pieces, neutral colors, and closed-toe shoes

Business Casual flair. Business casual is a professional dress code blending traditional business wear with relaxed, comfortable elements, appropriate for offices and events, typically including items like dress shirts, blouses, slacks, khakis, dresses, and blazers, while avoiding overly casual attire like T-shirts, hoodies, or flip-flops. The key is a polished, professional look that's less formal than a full suit, with flexibility depending on industry and company culture, often incorporating clean lines, quality fabrics, and well-maintained accessories like loafers or smart sneakers.

Artsy style flair. Artsy style is a creative, expressive fashion aesthetic that treats clothing as wearable art, featuring bold colors, abstract or graphic prints (like surrealism, pop art), unconventional silhouettes, and unique textures. It's about personal expression, embracing handmade/vintage finds, layering, and unexpected combinations, moving away from trends and perfection for a fun, individualistic look that feels like a statement piece.

Mob Wife style flair. The ""mob wife"" style is a bold, glamorous aesthetic featuring fur coats (faux or vintage), animal prints (especially leopard), excessive gold jewelry, leather, dark colors (black, red), and big hair/makeup, evoking the opulent, powerful looks from mafia movies and TV shows like The Sopranos. It's about confidence, luxury, and making a statement with flashy, over-the-top pieces that mix high-end vibes with edgy textures, often drawing from Italian-American fashion influences.

Boho style flair. Boho style (Bohemian) is a free-spirited, eclectic fashion and design aesthetic inspired by hippie, vintage, and global cultures, emphasizing natural fabrics, flowing silhouettes, layering, and earthy tones mixed with vibrant colors, intricate patterns, and rich textures like lace, fringe, and embroidery for a comfortable, individualistic, and artistic look. Key elements include wide-leg pants, maxi dresses, peasant tops, floppy hats, layered jewelry (turquoise, natural stones), and natural materials like suede and woven textiles. 

Blue Monday flair. We created blue Monday as a way to help bust the Monday blues. It can be anything blue. You could even wear a yellow dress and have something blue in the background. Make it a where’s Waldo picture. Have fun with it.

Red Shoe Tuesday flair. Red Shoe Tuesday is a weekly initiative from the Red Shoe Movement, encouraging people to wear red shoes on Tuesdays to support women's career advancement, gender equality, and inclusive workplaces, keeping the conversation going about creating equitable environments for all talent. It's a visual symbol of commitment to breaking barriers like the glass ceiling and fostering belonging, often shared on social media with hashtags like #RedShoeTuesday. 

Wednesday is for Pink flair. The tradition of wearing pink on Wednesdays is not just a fashion statement but a powerful symbol of empowerment and community. This trend gained significant popularity from the iconic film ``Mean Girls,'' where the characters emphasized wearing pink on Wednesdays as a way to bond and express individuality.

Throwback Thursday flair. Got an old picture you really enjoy. Show it on Thursdays. If you still have the outfit do a side by side of the old you and current you. Again have fun with it.

Favorite Friday flair. What’s your favorite outfit? Let’s see them. We all have a favorite dress or skirt. Maybe it’s a favorite hat. Doesn’t matter what ever is your fav.

Multi color Saturday flair. Let’s see your multi colored outfits. Again could be a dress or a top, a cover up.  Could be a multi colored necklace. It’s all about the fun. 

Floral Sunday flair. Come on we all have those floral prints. Show them off we all love them.

Moderator Award best dressed flair. If your outfit is especially good one of the mods may award you with a best dressed flair. We are going to try to give one every day. But some days we might not and so it’s not a popularity contest we won’t give the same individual multiple days in a row. We would love to award everyone but it’s just not possible.

Moderator Award/ Casual and still classy flair.
Like the other award but we know that we can’t dress to the nines every day. Some days it’s just nice to dress casual and enjoy the day.

1q00o9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1q00o9x/this_is_getting_nasty/,This is getting nasty.,"Long story short … I think I got some autoimmune issues from severe stress triggering PTSD and also being on a vegan diet for too long. This is 10+ years ago now. Going over to an all-meat diet fixed me. Well, as long as I stayed on the meat diet. Fast forward 6 years and I get COVID, Sjoergens Disease and live in a moldy house — all within the same year. I got so sick that I was completely bedridden for 2 years. I had a really hard time getting hold of any specialists, mostly because I was so god damn destroyed that I couldn’t act or think properly. 

Things slowly got better when I got my gp to perscribe me LDN. For a three month period I was close to normal, I even had some beers now and then for the first time in 10 years. But then I had this horrible accident that led to a near death experience where I ALMOST lost my kidneys (long complicated story) but I did get help for that, and I did actually get through it— tho I lost about 10kg and was very weak for a long time. 

After this, my health started to decline again. I went to a rehabilitation centre for a while, where I only got worse after ingesting soy by mistake. I knew soy was a big trigger for me, but I didn’t know that the particular food I ate there had soy in it. After this I started reacting to everything again. Now, lately things have gotten worse. Living with a partner now, some things are easier in general but it’s easier than ever to eat or drink the wrong things, since she does not have the same problem as me and brings allot of food into the house that is foreign to my system.

This is all on me tho, for not being disciplined enough. After she moved in I’ve eaten allot more processed foods, some soda here and there, and other small things. This is the only thing that really deviates from my old food routine. Well that and the occasional hair-spray and cologne that triggers me. 

One other thing I’ve noticed is that I seem to get allot sicker with stress. (underlying PTSD) Sometimes my nervous system is very sensitive. Even tho I work stuff out the stressors remains deep in my psyche and I feel somewhat unsafe from day to day. I don’t want to mention any specific details. 

But the thing is, now I can’t even shower without getting a major reaction. I seem to be extremely sensitive to everything I consume. Switching a coffee brand can really fox me up.
I’ve tried to get an appointment for an immunologist but with no luck. Reumatologist declines. To my suprise— a neurologist took me in. He admits that this is not his field, but we agreed on trying different medications to see if anything helps.

- I tried Ketotifen but became extremely depressed and fatigued.
- I do take Cetrizine and Pepcid daily.
- I do take Quercetine daily.
- LDN still daily.
- Testosterone cream
- Just started Fluvoxamine 12,5mg

Other than meds and stuff, it’s the diet: mostly meat, some glutenfree bread, cheese and coffee. Maybe a bit too much coffee sometimes. I don’t know how good that is, but it helps with the brain fog. I’m having some hopes for the Fluvoxamine and Sigma-1 benefits. And yes, I know about the caffeine interaction. I’m planning on weening off caffeine to see if it helps more in the long run.

I’m sorry(?) for the long post, I just need to vent. I guess it would be nice to talk to other people and share experiences aswel. And I’m very interested in the success stories out there.. I read some of them here from time to time. I live in Norway, and it’s dark and depressing this time of year. Staying home alone at New Years while everyone else is out partying. I can’t say it doesn’t affect me. I’m still fairly young and I am very hungry for experience. ",3,1767146441.0,MCAS,2,0.8,False

1q00mah,https://i.redd.it/san42vqt4gag1.jpeg,The Anti-Resolution: Why January 1st Financial Goals Are Designed to Fail,"Somewhere around 6:47 AM on January 2nd, you will download a budgeting app. You will feel virtuous. The interface will be clean, the graphs promising, the categories waiting to be filled with your newly disciplined spending data.

By Valentine's Day, the app will be buried three screens deep on your phone, unopened since January 19th. The notification badges will pile up like unpaid bills. And you will feel, as you have felt before, like a person who simply cannot get their financial life together.

Here is the uncomfortable truth: that feeling is not a bug. It is a feature.

# The Self-Improvement Industry Profits From Your January

Estimates suggest the U.S. self-improvement market exceeds $16 billion annually \[1\]. A significant chunk of that revenue concentrates in January, when motivation spikes and wallets open. Gyms, apps, courses, and coaches have all built business models around a single predictable phenomenon: the gap between who you believe you will become on January 1st and who you actually are by February.

This is not a failure of willpower. It is a failure of design. And the people who designed it are counting on your repeat business next year.

# The Fresh Start Effect Is Real. That Is the Problem.

In 2014, researchers at the Wharton School published a paper that would become foundational reading for marketers, behavioral economists, and anyone trying to understand why New Year feels so psychologically potent \[2\]. Katherine Milkman, Hengchen Dai, and Jason Riis examined 3,104 days of Google search data and found that queries for ""diet"" surge 82.1% at the start of a new year. Tracking 11,912 university gym members, they documented a 33.4% increase in visits at the start of each week, a 47.1% spike at semester beginnings, and an 11.6% boost at the new year.

They called this the ""Fresh Start Effect."" The psychological mechanism is elegant: temporal landmarks create mental discontinuity. January 1st is not just another day. It is a partition between your imperfect past self and your theoretically perfected future self. The failures belong to the old you. The resolutions belong to the new you.

Discarded running shoes in the rain representing abandoned goals

The problem is what happens after the partition.

The same research acknowledges that motivation ""spikes on the first day... and declines rapidly thereafter"" \[2\]. In a follow-up study on retirement savings, the fresh start framing produced only about $11 per month in additional contributions \[3\]. Less than the cost of a Netflix subscription. The effect is real, measurable, and largely useless for sustained behavioral change.

Worse, subsequent research by Dai found that fresh starts can actually harm high performers. Professional baseball players traded mid-season (a natural temporal landmark) who had been performing above average saw a 5% decrease in batting average after the reset \[4\]. The psychological distance from past self cuts both ways. You can leave your failures behind. You can also leave your momentum.

# The Resolution Failure Timeline Is Brutally Predictable

Strava, the fitness tracking app with over 135 million users, popularized the term ""Quitter's Day"" after analyzing hundreds of millions of logged activities \[5\]. Their data consistently shows that most resolution-makers abandon their goals by mid-January. The company found that approximately 80% of people who made New Year's resolutions had given up within the first few weeks.

The Stockholm University study (the most rigorous longitudinal research on resolutions) tracked 1,066 participants with monthly check-ins for a full year \[6\]. Their findings:

* **At one month:** Motivation had already begun declining significantly
* **At six months:** Only 55% of participants considered themselves successful
* **At twelve months:** Success rates varied dramatically by goal type

The critical distinction: approach-oriented goals (""I will save $200 per month"") succeeded at 58.9%, while avoidance-oriented goals (""I will stop spending on coffee"") succeeded at only 47.1%.

Financial resolutions fare no better. A 2025 Motley Fool survey of 2,000 adults found that only 27% successfully maintained their financial resolutions \[7\]. Vanguard reported that 75% of Americans fell short of their saving and spending goals in the same year \[8\].

Most financial resolutions are framed as deprivation. They are goals about what you will not do, what you will not buy, what you will not enjoy. The psychology works against you from the start.

# The Gym Industry's Business Model Requires Your Failure

Planet Fitness operates over 2,575 locations with 18.7 million members \[9\]. That averages to roughly 7,262 members per gym. Typical capacity? Between 200 and 350 people maximum.

A lonely treadmill in an empty gym with sunlight streaming in

NPR's *Planet Money* did this calculation and arrived at the obvious conclusion \[10\]. If members actually showed up four times weekly, gyms would need 257 people working out at all times, far exceeding physical capacity. ""If people actually came to the gym,"" the report noted, ""Planet Fitness would have to charge a lot more than $10 a month.""

The International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association reports an average annual retention rate of 71.4% for health clubs \[11\]. That means nearly 29% of members leave each year. But that understates the problem: according to IHRSA, 50% of new members abandon their gym membership within six months of joining \[11\]. Americans waste an estimated $1.8 billion annually on memberships to facilities they rarely or never visit \[12\].

A landmark study in the *American Economic Review* titled ""Paying Not to Go to the Gym"" found that members paying $70 or more per month attended only 4.3 times monthly \[13\]. That works out to roughly $17 per visit when $10 per-visit passes sat available. The researchers attributed this to ""overconfidence about future self-control.""

The gyms understood this better than the members did. They price it specifically for this.

The friction architecture is intentional. Sign up online in minutes. Cancel? In-person visits or mailed letters. At $10 per month, the annoyance of canceling exceeds the annoyance of continued charges. January joiners have a 45% higher churn rate than members joining in other months \[14\]. The industry knows this and prices accordingly.

""You are actually the gym's best customer"" if you never show up.

# Finance Apps Monetize the Same Psychology

January 2025 saw health and fitness app in-app purchase revenue hit an all-time record of $385 million, up 10% year-over-year \[15\]. Budgeting apps see similar January spikes. This surge meets a brutal retention reality.

According to Adjust's 2024 report, the global median day-1 retention rate for finance apps was 20%, dropping to just 9% by day 30 \[16\]. That means 91% of people who download a finance app in January will have abandoned it within a month. The problem is not that the apps are bad. The problem is that downloading an app is not the same as changing your behavior. The purchase satisfies the psychological need to ""do something"" without requiring you to do anything difficult.

The monetization strategy exploits this gap directly. Annual subscriptions now comprise 41.43% of all app subscriptions \[17\]. The strategic logic: annual subscribers show 33.9% retention after one year versus only 13.8% for monthly plans. But here is the kicker: nearly 30% of annual subscriptions are canceled in the first month \[17\]. Users remain locked in for the year anyway.

The January annual subscription push is calculated: lock in motivated users before the predictable disengagement, then profit from the inertia.

# Identity Shifts Do Not Need Calendar Permission

The counterevidence to resolution culture comes from identity-based change research.

James Clear, synthesizing decades of behavioral psychology in *Atomic Habits*, draws a distinction between outcome-based habits (""I want to lose 20 pounds"") and identity-based habits (""I am someone who moves every day"") \[18\]. The difference is not semantic. ""Your current behaviors,"" Clear writes, ""are simply a reflection of your current identity.""

An open journal and glass of water on a desk representing identity work

Outcome-based goals ask: What do I want to achieve?

Identity-based goals ask: Who do I want to become?

The January resolution is almost always outcome-based. It is a target, a number, a destination. And when you miss the target (because you will miss the target), the failure feels categorical. You set out to save $10,000 and saved $6,200. The resolution failed. You failed.

Identity does not work this way. If your goal is to become ""someone who pays themselves first,"" then every automated transfer is a vote for that identity. Every small decision compounds. Phillippa Lally's research at UCL found that habits take an average of 66 days to form, but with a range of 18 to 254 days depending on complexity \[19\]. Missing a single day did not materially affect the formation process.

This is the opposite of the resolution model, where one slip triggers abandonment.

BJ Fogg's Stanford Behavior Design Lab research reinforces the identity approach: ""Habit formation isn't a function of repetition... it's a function of emotion"" \[20\]. Start behaviors so small they require almost no motivation. Celebrate immediately. Identity follows behavior, not the reverse.

# The Anti-Resolution in Practice

In January 2023, Equinox refused new memberships on January 1st \[21\]. The luxury fitness brand launched a campaign called ""We Don't Speak January."" Their manifesto stated: ""January is a language we don't understand. It wants you to start something when you should be in the middle of it.""

The company explicitly acknowledged that 70% of January signups come ""out of guilt"" and cease within weeks. Equinox reported that 95% of their members remain after one year. They are not selling a fresh start. They are selling a lifestyle already in progress.

The alternative framework is older than behavioral economics. The Japanese concept of *kaizen*, continuous small improvement, assumes that every element of life can be improved incrementally without waiting for arbitrary dates \[22\]. Rather than annual dramatic resolutions that collapse under their own weight, kaizen treats improvement as a daily practice.

The Stockholm study found something that supports this: extended support with too many goals and deadlines paradoxically decreased success \[6\]. Simple social support with monthly check-ins outperformed complex interventions. The simpler the system, the more likely it survived contact with real life.

# The Anti-Resolution Protocol

Here is what this looks like in practice. Not a list of goals. A shift in how you relate to goals entirely.

**First, choose one identity statement, not an outcome.** Not ""I will save $500 per month."" Instead: ""I am someone who pays themselves first."" The difference matters. The outcome can be missed. The identity can be reinforced with any action, any amount, on any day.

**Second, pick one action so small it cannot fail.** Auto-transfer $25 every payday. That is it. Not $500. Not a percentage you calculated based on optimal savings rate theory. Twenty-five dollars. The point is not the amount. The point is the repetition of the identity.

Hands counting cash on a wooden table symbolizing small, tangible financial habits

**Third, make the action automatic.** Willpower is a depletable resource \[23\]. Systems are not. If the $25 moves without your intervention, you have removed decision fatigue from the equation entirely. You cannot forget. You cannot talk yourself out of it. The system votes for your identity whether you feel motivated or not.

**Fourth, track one number weekly.** Net worth trend. Savings rate. Debt balance. Not all three. One. The number should be simple enough that checking it takes less than two minutes. Complexity kills compliance.

**Fifth, lower the drama and raise the repetition.** Thirty boring reps beat one dramatic reset. The goal is not to feel transformed. The goal is to behave, repeatedly, like the person you want to become until you are that person.

You can start this today. December 29th. Not because the date matters, but because the date does not matter. That is the point.

# Conclusion: The House Always Wins (Unless You Stop Playing)

The self-improvement industry has monetized a psychological phenomenon whose limitations were documented in the original research. The Fresh Start Effect spikes motivation. Then motivation declines rapidly. The researchers who discovered it said so explicitly.

Gyms sign up 20 times more members than capacity allows. Finance apps push annual subscriptions knowing most users will churn but the subscription will outlast the engagement. Courses launch with ""lifetime access"" knowing most buyers will never log in after week two.

They are betting you will fail. The data says you probably will, if you play the game their way.

The anti-resolution is not about abandoning improvement. It is about recognizing that January 1st is a product. A manufactured moment of hope, timed precisely to extract maximum revenue from minimum follow-through. The psychological mechanism that makes fresh starts feel powerful (distancing from past self) can be created intentionally at any time through conscious identity work.

Real change does not need a commercialized holiday. It needs a shift in who you believe yourself to be.

Every action is a vote for identity. Those votes can be cast on any Tuesday in March, any Sunday in August, or right now. December 29th is as good as any other day.

Better, even. Because nobody is selling it to you.

Sorry for how long this post is about to be. For context; I am an older teen girl, I will be an adult in a year and I am about to graduate high school in May! I am an early grad, which means I am getting out of here a year early and starting college very soon. I’m very active in the art scene and in our arts district where we live, my major was even in 2D visual design at my art high school! However, ever since I was 14 I’ve taken a very keen interest in mortuary science and being a trade embalmer, so I am switching it up and I will be going to college for that instead of art. I am the eldest daughter in my family (my mother and father’s first born), my parents divorced after having my younger sister (I do have two other siblings from both my mom and my dad, but they have a separate mom and dad and aren’t important to what is going on at the moment), I live with my mom and they did have split custody—with my mom having majority and I only spend the weekend at my dad’s. Haven’t stayed with my dad since an incident that happened years ago involving him getting very drunk and my mom having to pick my sister and I up. 

With that out of the way onto the issue:

I am a very head strong, feminist, with friends of all colors, genders, sexualities, who truly believes that everyone is entitled to equality and all humans should have equal opportunity. The mortuary field is a very male dominated one but is slowing shifting to be more equal which is awesome! I’m glad to be going into a field where I am making a difference and helping women break into the space more. I also love to work out, I love coffee and trying new spots, I also really love trying new food! My dad shares my love for trying new food spots and also my love of creating art, which I really enjoyed bonding with him over! My dad’s grandfather was also a mortician so I thought he would’ve been happy to see me go into a path my family has history with, but I may be wrong. See my family on that side is HEAVILY Mormon, and while a lot of my cousins and aunts/uncles have broken through the cycle, majority have not. My dad is in this weird area where he still believes in Mormonism but literally breaks every single rule they have? I am not Mormon, I drink coffee/tea, wear tank tops and shorter shorts/skirts, have a nostril piercing and my double lobes pierced, haven’t gone to church in years, and I am most definitely not the type who wants to have kids and get married just to stay at home (no shame to stay at home parents at all, just not for me). I think this may be contributing to the crap my dad keeps saying to me such as: making jokes about how women are gold diggers, how women aren’t strong (I quite literally go to the gym and probably have more muscle to fat ratio then him), how women would love the sport curling cause they sweep (haha get it cause we love to clean), and of course the infamous women belong in the kitchen. I’ve always shared a love for baking and cooking, something I also have in common with my dad but it’s making me think that: does he like I do these things because it appeals to the misogynistic views he has of women? And is this why he is so standoffish about the field I want to go into because it doesn’t fit traditional roles? 

This has all started very recently, and mind you my dad has three daughters (myself and my 2 younger sisters), could this be him being upset he has no sons? Is he upset he shares characteristics with me simply because I am a girl? He doesn’t direct these jokes at my sisters, just me. He also has gotten very weird about commenting on my clothes and body as well. For instance: when we were in the mall the other day I had a heavy jacket on because its winter, but the mall was very very hot inside. We were walking around and I decided to take my big jacket off in the store, I was wearing a john colt tank underneath as I usually don’t wear long sleeves because I have weird sensory issues and my jacket was enough to keep my warm (just to preface these tanks are pretty modest like most brandy tank tops are, covered my entire torso and has thicker lace straps, and wasnt tight just form fitting—and I was wearing some cute flared jeans from hollister, zero rips as ripped jeans aren’t in style right now and haven’t been for ages it seems). My dad starts absolutely tripping, talking about how I need to put my jacket back on and such, even though my face was visibly red and I was sweaty. He does this a lot and will comment on all my clothes, but I don’t even own anything skimpy or revealing? I just have tanks, cute sweaters, flared jeans, baggy jeans, a LOT of graphic tees, some general stuff that fits to my body but again not tight. I don’t wear ripped stuff or anything remotely inappropriately revealing for my age. In fact a lot of my clothes I wear are unisex and I pass old clothes down to both my youngest sister AND my little brother. I have no clue where his weird behavior towards me is coming from at all, it’s making me feel as if my dad doesn’t love me or looks at me in a weird way and I am heavily uncomfortable. 

If you guys can offer me advice or guidance I would really appreciate it, I’m going to be moving for college in a year and a half all the way across the country so I won’t have to deal with him soon. But I just want an explanation or possible one. Thank you so much Reddit.


TL;DR: Dad keeps making misogynistic jokes directed at me and me only (I have other sisters), also comments on my body and my clothes negatively and frequently. All these instances stick with me and I would like some guidance. ",2,1767146220.0,Parents,3,1.0,False

While I’ve explored the mainstream tech podcasts, nothing quite replicates that specific ""chill studio vibe."" I’m looking for community recommendations for something raw and unscripted—what are you all listening to lately?

Disclaimer: I wrote this entire post myself, using my own mind and mental faculties. These are my original thoughts, articulated by me, for this community.

# The Ghost of a Daily Ritual

Do you ever experience that strange muscle memory where you open an app, thumb over to the same spot, and then realize the content you’re looking for isn’t there anymore? That has been my experience with the Lew Later podcast. For a long time, that show was my daily background noise—the soundtrack to my morning coffee or a way to kill the boredom of a long commute. It wasn’t just about the ""leaked iPhone renders"" or the latest folding phone news. It was the atmosphere. Lew, Will, and the crew had an effortless way of making you feel like you were sitting in the studio with them, catching the tail end of a great conversation. It was human, it was raw, and I truly miss it.

# The Struggle with ""Corporate"" Alternatives

I’ve spent the last few months trying to ""rebound"" with other tech podcasts, but honestly, it’s been a struggle. I’ve cycled through the top-tier names—the ones that always dominate the charts—and while they are technically ""good,"" they don’t hit the same way. Most of them feel like they are being recorded in a sterile environment by people following a strict teleprompter. They’re polished, they’re scripted, and they’re... safe. I’ve realized that I’m hunting for that ""lightning in a bottle"" mix of high-level tech insight and completely unhinged, authentic banter. Even though I’ve found a few decent shows, nothing has managed to replicate that specific, relaxed ""chill vibe"" that made Lew Later so easy to leave on for hours.

# What’s Powering Your Headphones Lately?

Since I am still very much on the hunt for something that feels authentic and unforced, I’m turning to this community. What is actually in your rotation right now? I’m looking for the shows that don’t feel like a 45-minute PR pitch. I want the stuff that’s a bit messy, a bit loud, and deeply passionate about the intersection of tech and culture. Whether it’s a tiny indie show or a hidden gem that everyone seems to be sleeping on, I’m all ears. I’m looking for quality over hype—something that feels like a real conversation.

I genuinely appreciate everyone who takes the time to read this and drop a suggestion in the comments. This community is the best at filtering through the noise to find the ""good stuff,"" and I’m looking forward to seeing what you guys are vibing with.

Before I sign off—I want to wish everyone a massive Happy Holidays, an incredible Happy New Year, and a very belated Merry Christmas! I hope you all had a chance to unplug and enjoy some new tech over the break.

A baker’s daughter through and through, Dalila lives up to her last name. She’s sweet, warm, and almost always smells faintly like vanilla. She’s an amateur fashion designer currently working as an assistant at a major fashion company, dreaming of the day she’ll run her own brand instead of fetching coffee for models and executives. Fashion design is her biggest passion. She’s great at sewing, sketching, and putting together unique pieces, and she rarely goes anywhere without her sketchbook. She’s a perfectionist, super creative, and always working on a new idea. Outside of fashion, she loves baking, coffee, and anything sweet. Her preferred style of dress is coquette - very feminine and pink. 

Dalila gets stressed easily and often throws herself into her projects so much that she forgets to eat or talk to anyone until she’s done. Her anxiety tends to rule her life, and she struggles with a lack of self-confidence.

Dalila eventually meets [Lyam](https://toyhou.se/14765547.liam), who speaks both English and French. They click instantly, feel comfortable around each other right away, and their friendship quickly turns into a very affectionate, very committed relationship. Almost too quickly.

No, she didn't steal it. She doesn't need it. And it wasn't malicious.

The first pic was at Disneyland this summer about 5 weeks before I started fasting. Second pic is at Disneyland a few days before this Christmas. Not the best photos but I can see a difference in my face. 25 lbs down! I still have 30-40 lbs more I’d like to lose but I’m happy with my slow but steady progress! 

I started IF officially on August 1st, 2025 a week ahead of a long overdue doctor appointment on August 8th, because I was embarrassed at how much weight I had gained at the last appointment and was hoping to drop at least some water weight. I found out I was at my heaviest weight of my LIFE and pre-diabetic! It scared me straight and I have been able to stick to IF ever since. My Zero app says I got a 151 day streak today. I manage a very busy school cafeteria so I find it easy to fast 18-21 hours while I’m working. On weekends my fasts are shorter so I average 18 hours. 

I had my A1C checked again Thanksgiving week and I was sitting at 5.5, which is officially NOT prediabetic, yay! I’m working on getting it lower by my next bloodwork in the spring. As of now I’m down 25 lbs, though progress has basically halted over my 2 week winter break due to longer eating windows, more carbs/treats and less movement, but these were planned indulgences and I’m not “derailed” like I’ve thought so many times before. I’m actually looking forward to getting back to my normal routine when school resumes January 5th. 

My diet in general has improved since I reduced ultra processed carbs and cut back on the wine. I used to eat ice cream every single night and bake a few times a week and that has stopped. I think I’ve only baked 3 times since August and that was over Thanksgiving and twice over Christmas break. Progress over perfection! 

For exercise I just walk my dog. I’m fortunate to live backed up to a forest with hills and hiking trails so I’ve been utilizing that again. In addition to managing a school cafeteria I also costume musicals, am on the board of a musical theatre company, and have 2 very busy teens so my schedule is pretty tight, but this lifestyle has given me the energy to handle all of it! Plus my aches and pains have reduced drastically. I’m so grateful for this lifestyle and I’m so glad I have momentum going into the new year so I don’t have to start from scratch like so many failed years before!

Distillery: Maker's Mark

Age: NAS

Price: $59.99

Proof: 110.9

Nose: Really well rounded. Soft. No ethanol at all for being over 110 proof, yet the notes are rich. Cherry. Milk chocolate. Caramel. The sweetness really carries the nose here. There's some underlying cinnamon but I'd even liken that more to a baked cinnamon apple.

Palate: Not off the charts thick, but there's definitely some nice viscosity to it. The caramel is more noticeable here than in the nose. There's even some surprising nuttiness to it. Very Praline's 'n Cream like. Sweet luxardo cherry. Toasted oak.

Finish: Medium length. Wish it was a little longer if I'm being honest and it makes me think a hypothetical hazmat version of this would be an all time great bottle. More caramel. Slight coffee grounds. It's a little bready. The star here is the unmistakable chocolate note. It really gives off a chocolate donut thing. It's really nice.

Score: 8.3

Summary: Found this on a whim at Costco for $59.99. I don't think I've ever seen a Lost Recipe bottle on a shelf anywhere for any price so needless to say I was happy about it. Long story short this is essentially a Private Select bottle with a stave combination that has never been bottled before that includes the ""archived"" mocha stave. I'm generally a pretty big fan of Maker's and have enjoyed every special release I've tried. Expectations we're pretty high and I can say they were definitely met. I know the whole ""Mocha"" thing can be somewhat gimmicky, but man this didn't disappoint. I usually have a tough time picking up on chocolatey notes, but like I said about the finish this was unmistakable. It's flavorful, it's rich, it drinks under the proof, and I'll be sad when it's gone. It perfectly rides the line of being sweet without being desserty. One of the top scores I've ever given out and I'm truly wondering if maybe I'm underrating it. 8.3.

1. Terrible | Drain pour after the first sip
2. Very Bad | Trying to choke it down but possible drain pour
3. Poor | Would drink if forced to but never under my own will
4. Below Average | Not off-putting but not my cup of tea
5. Average | I'll take it
6. Good | Enjoyable sip
7. Very Good | Well above average
8. Excellent | A drink I will remember

I was recently hired, and my first day at work was yesterday; today was my second day. I received my offer letter only 30 minutes before my first day, which felt really strange—especially since I had already waited two weeks to even start after being hired.

My trainer told me that everyone usually gets two weeks of training, but unfortunately, that isn’t the case for me. I only have five days of training total, and it’s broken up by a full week in between. I’m feeling really stressed because there is so much to learn in such a short amount of time, and it honestly doesn’t feel fair.

I do have experience—I’ve worked at Dunkin’ for over 4 years but that was while I was in high school in college and two other small coffee shops—so I’m not completely new to this. Still, Starbucks is very different, and I feel a lot of pressure. It also feels like I’m not learning fast enough, and things just aren’t clicking yet.

Does anyone have advice on what I can do during this week before I go back to finish my last two days of training and start working on my own? What should I be focusing on, and how can I become a better barista overall?

I don't even know what I can do and can't do anymore on the platform, grok is proving to be an untrustworthy app, because one day you can make things, vanilla things, and the other day you can't (and you paid for an entire month/year for what you could make yesterday, not for what you will be allowed to make tomorrow). this is beyond frustration.

I'm not looking for any finished artwork, just concept art or even basic pencil sketches. I refuse to use AI to generate my ideas. 

I personally really struggle to draw environments and having the picture helps me visualize the scenes. If I do get around to publishing (doubtful tbh) you would receive written credit and I will forever sing your praises to everyone I know (and probably display your sketches proudly on my wall). 

The landscape is very complex and requires significant knowledge of perspective drawing. Yes I will absolutely pay you more if your skills demand it, but I still have to feed myself and pay my bills. But I do cook very very well! Or I'll order you starship or something idk

1q00278,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1q00278/the_haunted_bench/,the haunted bench,"Hi all!

ISO: ideally a witch but also any general energy worker / exorcist for an EXTREME case (non-responsive to traditional methods) of haunted/cursed/negatively charged furniture/spaces. My IKEA 2017 Stockholm Bench/Coffee table has recently been negatively charged or possibly possessed and I'm looking for more heavy duty methods to try cleansing it. NYT !

To give you some background, a few weeks ago, a friend of mine brought, with no warning, his friend (French) who was visiting his long-distance boyfriend (Film student) into my home for a dinner party. The friend and the boyfriend sat on this bench in my living room for the entire evening - even while everyone else ate dinner in my dining room because they did not want to eat with us - whispering into each other's ears and making comments to one another. Overall, they were riddled with negative energies and I, as well as the other guests, felt aggressed by their presence -- especially from the boyfriend -- who should be noted also complimented a painting and lamp I have.

After everyone left, I burnt some olive leaves around my home and meditated in the space to set positive intentions, yet I still felt uneasy. Immediately after the next day, the living room started to feel really weird and just absolutely threatening. When I crossed the threshold from the corridor into the living room, I immediately felt a heavy feeling in my upper back like something was watching me/behind me/just dangerous. It just started feeling weird in that room and very, very different. However, I made the dangerous decision to ignore this feeling and during that week the painting the boyfriend complimented fell from the wall and shattered as did the lightbulb in the lamp he complimented. Moreover, my evil eye amulet broke. With the weird feeling in my upper back I put two and two together that it was probably the boyfriend as he was the weirder one of the two and he also had bad upper-back posture. I first cleansed the salt in the living room and then tried completely newly charged, warded salt but to no avail. I realized that it was probably the bench when my laptop kept disconnecting from the wifi while I would use it. 

For more background, the friend and boyfriend broke up a few days later because the friend felt the boyfriend was not an appropriate match for him as he felt he was nasty spirited. I think this has something to do with the energies left on the bench as things have felt hostile in the space and when I've had people over in my living room they've felt like they've been more aggressive and angry than their normal selves. To test this, I tried removing the bench from my living room and I put it in my bedroom. In just the first night, this resulted in terrible nightmares which would wake me from my sleep. I then instead moved it to the kitchen just briefly which still caused terrors every time I would eat - fires, floods, locusts, etc., 

I also want to say, this is not super my area of spiritual expertise. I have never been super well acquainted with spiritual possessions and banishings. I've avoided these because I just simply have not felt too well-versed on these topics and it just first-hand is not something I like working with/doing. And before you message me, ""Oh, this sounds like a portal"", I want you to know that this is DEFINITELY not a portal. I have dealt with portals in other spaces before and I know the difference between portals and possessions.

I have tried different smoke and salt cleanses as well and banishings on the bench but nothing has seemed to be able to work. In fact, once I started to cleanse the bench is when things started to get even scarier. Monday this week, I took the bench outside to cleanse it and left it out overnight. Tuesday morning, things got really tense, mainly in the living room, and felt even more off than before. Wednesday, I then decided that something greater was wrong in the space and that the bench had to come back which made things a bit better, at first. But then on Thursday when I woke up, a salt dish which was in a completely inaccessible corner was completely flipped over. I defaulted to trying a banishing spell (from a book I trust but I don't want to get too into the specifics) and then simply emptying my coat closet with a protective charm and keeping the table in there for the meantime. However, this is only a short term solution as it has only now contained the energies to the closet. While this was only just yesterday, things still feel weird but better.

Overall, this has been really scary and really distressing. It has definitely put a strain on my relationship with my friend who brought these people over without warning or consent and it has limited my social life as I cannot really have people over. I want to keep the bench as much as possible as I have had it for years and cannot really imagine getting rid of it but I'm open to feedback about what's best to do. I feel like I cannot give it to anyone because of its energies and I don't want to have to incinerate it.

If anyone has any advice or is available to help, please reach out to me. The Blue Moon is coming up on Wednesday the 30th which I feel like is a substantially powerful moon for a banishing. I'm putting feelers out there now in advance for someone / a group of people who would be available then to help. 

Please note the bench in the post is and OLD picture of my bench - I would not bring the energies of it now onto you all. ",1,1767144757.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False
1q001u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q001u8/the_house_that_moved/,The House That Moved,"My phone buzzed with a voicemail notification from my lawyer.

""Mr. Esmond, I'm sorry for your loss, and you have my condolences. But we need to have a discussion regarding the will and the estate of your mother. Please reach out to me as soon as you can.""

I groaned; three weeks seemed long enough to wallow in my sorrow. The world didn't stop; I did. I called back and confirmed a meeting.

I pulled the covers over my head and tried to sleep, but sleep wouldn't come. Instead, I lay awake in my bed, replaying my mother's last words to me. 

She was lying on the hospital bed in her blue patient gown, hooked up to machines like some sick experiment, the sounds of the monitor machine beeping in melancholy tones. I remember her face; it was pale, lacking the blush of life, and her eyes were a dirty yellow sclera with remnants of a hint of brown left in her pupil.

""Bodie, no matter what happens, I know you will be fine. Grief is love with nowhere to go.""

Those words echoed in my head, and my eyes began to swell with tears. I finally passed out.

Now I'm standing in front of the house where I grew up, keys heavy in my palm. The cottage house sits on 7036 Roses Street like a tired old woman, her pastel yellow paint peeling, her burnt umber shutters askew, and the gardens full of weeds and thorns. Mom always said she'd fix up the place ""when she had time."" Time ran out three weeks ago.

I came here to pack things up, to sort through a lifetime of accumulated memories and decide what stays and what goes. The realtor says the house will sell quickly once it's emptied—cottage homes are popular with young couples looking for ""character and a simple vintage feel."" I suppose that's what they call the creaking floorboards and the drafty windows that never quite close properly.

The key turns with familiar resistance. The door swings open, and the smell hits me immediately: lavender, old books, and something inimitably maternal. My legs nearly give out. For a moment, I expect to hear her voice calling from the kitchen, asking if I want tea and to sit down for a conversation.

The silence is absolute.

I set my overnight bag down and looked around. I should start with the kitchen, I think. That's always easiest; dishes and utensils don't carry emotional weight. But my feet carry me instead to the living room, where I sink into Dad's old recliner that sat in the corner. He died when I was seventeen, and Mom never moved the chair.

Next to the chair was a small end table, and on top of it was a family photo of baby me, Mom, and Dad, posing in front of the house. They looked so happy and hopeful of the future, just a young couple who eloped and were ready to spearhead any challenge with their baby boy. They were on top of the world.

I looked around the living room more intently. The furniture was arranged exactly as she'd left it: two chairs positioned facing each other slightly, a small table between them, the afghan draped over the back of the sofa that looked out the front window of the house with a coffee table in front of it, and the stack of romance novels on the table with the reading glasses perched on top of them.

\*\*\*

I close my eyes and try to remember the last conversation we had. It was about Jane, about the divorce. Mom had listened with that patient expression she always wore when I was troubled, her hands folded in her lap.

""Sometimes people grow apart, Bodie,"" she'd said. ""It doesn't mean the love wasn't real.""

I'd wanted to argue, to give an excuse or explanation, but that was simply the truth. Jane and I had become strangers sharing a house, polite and distant, going through the motions of a marriage that had died somewhere along the way. But Mom had a way of cutting through my self-pity with quiet but stern wisdom.

""What about Emma?"" she'd asked. ""Have you talked to her about this?""

Emma. My daughter. Twenty-three years old and brilliant, working at a nonprofit in Boston. She'd stopped returning my calls after the divorce papers were filed. I told myself it was because she was busy, that she needed time to process. But the truth was, I'd failed as a husband, and now I am failing as a father.

\*\*\*

The house settles around me with familiar creaks and sighs. I should make myself something to eat, maybe start going through Mom's possessions. Instead, I find myself walking through the rooms of the house, touching things and taking in the nostalgia of it all.

I made my way up to my old bedroom; it was exactly as I'd left it when I left for college. School trophies on shelves covered in dust, posters of bands I'd loved when music vainly mattered to me, and a desk where I'd written essays and worked on projects that piqued a boy's interest at the time.

Every surface, every corner holds a memory. This house isn't just a building, it was a time capsule of the boy I once was, a physical manifestation of everything I was before life taught me how to lose things.

I sit on the edge of the bed and pull out my phone. Emma's name was on the screen, the last text from her dated three weeks ago: 

""Sorry about Grandma. Let me know if you need anything.""

I'd never responded. What was I supposed to say? That I needed everything? That I was drowning in grief and guilt and couldn't figure out how to be a person anymore? The phone stays in my hand, heavy with unanswered texts.

I'll start packing tomorrow, I decided. Tonight, I just want to sit in this house and remember what it felt like to be whole.

\*\*\*

I awoke at 2:23 AM to the sound of the house moving.

The floorboards beneath me shift and groan with purpose, and the walls seem to breathe around me. I sat up in bed, my heart pounding in my chest, and I listened. The rational part of my mind, the part that spent two decades evaluating insurance claims and calculating risk, immediately offers explanations. Old houses make noise. The heating system could be acting up, causing expansion and contraction in the walls. 

I sat perfectly still, waiting for it to happen again. When it did, five minutes later, I felt a mixture of terror and relief. Terror because houses aren't supposed to move. Relief because it meant I wasn't completely losing my mind.

""Foundation settling,"" I said aloud.

But this isn't settling. This is movement, deliberate and strange, as if the house itself is responding to the emotional turmoil within me. The increasingly frequent motions suggest something uncanny, sometimes a gentle swaying, like being rocked to sleep, and other times a bouncy forward motion, as though the house were walking on invisible legs at a brisk hurrying pace. 

Through the windows, I watch the world outside shift and change. Sometimes it's the neighborhood I remember from childhood, with kids riding bikes and mothers hanging laundry on lines. Sometimes it's the present day, with newer cars and manicured lawns. Sometimes it's something else entirely, rolling hills and distant mountains, as if the house is traveling through landscapes that exist only in dreams.

I grab my phone and turn on the flashlight, stepping carefully into the hallway. The beam cuts through the darkness, revealing walls that look perfectly ordinary. The family photos hang straight in their frames. The runner down the center of the hall lies flat and undisturbed. Yet beneath my feet, the floor continues to shift and sway.

""This isn't happening,"" I whisper to the darkness. ""This is grief. This is stress. This is everything finally catching up with me.""

It must be grief-induced hallucinations. They're common, especially in the first few months after loss. The mind plays tricks when it's overwhelmed by trauma. That's what this is. It has to be.

I make my way downstairs, gripping the banister for support. Each step feels like it's moving beneath me, but the flashlight beam shows everything in its proper place. The living room looks exactly as it did before I went to bed.

I settle into the recliner and close my eyes, focusing on my breathing. In through the nose, out through the mouth. A technique taught to me during one of the marriage counseling sessions with Jane, back when we still believed we could fix what was broken between us.

The house continues its strange journey around me.

\*\*\*

I awoke to silence and stillness; I must have fallen asleep from the stress and panic earlier. I looked around, scanning for any anomaly. I noticed the picture was flipped downward, and I propped it back upright. Everything in the house was the same, except for some items that had fallen to the floor.

I looked around the room and noticed soft sunlight peaking through the windows. I noticed the front door was no longer a dirty white door but a blue color.

I sat for a few seconds to gather myself until I began to hear something like waves crashing. It seems to be coming from behind the door, coming from outside. I got up and made my way towards the blue door, each step shaky, but as I got closer, a warm feeling seemed to soothe me, inviting me to open the door.

I turned the knob and opened the door; the light blinded me, and before me was a valley of lush greenery, roses of all colors spread out in beds, and a sandy dirt path leading through the pine trees to a sandy beach lake with ice-capped mountains looming in the far distant background. I made my way through the path and took a look behind me; there the house sat, almost as if it was smiling at me, like it was happy for me.

As I approached the sandy beach, the sunshine brought warmth to my skin, the cool winds brushed against my hair, the waves from the lake crashed melodically against the shore, and the buzzing of bees, butterflies, and dragonflies of vibrant colors filled the air. I stared in awe, taking in the beauty of the place that stood before me.

""I must be dreaming,"" I said to myself, gasping and pinching myself to make sure.

""All that pinching will leave you red,"" chuckled a familiar voice behind me.

Instantly, I felt goosebumps. Can't it be? That voice was warm and loving. I turned around slowly, and there she was, Mom. She was sitting on the sofa in the house.

She looks exactly as she did ten years ago, before the arthritis bent her fingers and the years painted silver in her hair. She's wearing her favorite dress, the blue one with tiny colored roses that she always wore to church, and she's reading one of her romance novels, lips curved in a small smile.

""Mom?"" The word comes out like a croak.

She looks up, and her face breaks into the warm smile I remember from childhood.

""Bodie, sweetheart. I was wondering when you'd wake up.""

I know this isn't real. I know she's dead; I watched them lower her casket into the ground three weeks ago. But she looks so solid, so present, that I can't help but hope.

""I thought..."" I start, then stop. How do you tell your dead mother that you thought she was dead?

""You thought I was gone,"" she says gently, setting down her book. ""I know, sweetheart. But I'm right here. I've always been right here.""

I can't help but deny what I'm seeing. My voice trembles as I manage to speak: 

""You can't be here,"" I say. ""You're dead. I was there. I held your hand from where you were lying in the casket.""

She gestures calmly for me to sit, as if my protest is just a child refusing to accept bedtime.

I want to. God, I want to sink into that couch and pretend the last three weeks never happened. I want to tell her about the divorce, about how I've messed everything up with Emma, and about how I feel like I'm drowning in my own life. But I can't move. Some part of me knows that if I sit down, if I accept this beautiful lie, I'll never be able to face the truth again.

Her expression doesn't change. ""I'm here now.""

""No."" I shake my head, standing up from the recliner. ""No, you're not. This is grief. This is my mind playing tricks. You're dead, and I'm alone in this house, and I'm losing my mind.""

She watches me with patient eyes. 

""If I'm not real, then what does it matter if you sit with me?""

The question stops me cold. If she's a hallucination, a product of my overwhelming grief, then what harm could there be in indulging it? What's wrong with spending a few minutes in a world where my mother is still alive.

 ""Because if I pretend you're here, then I'll never accept that you're gone. And if I don't accept that you're gone, then I'll never be able to move forward."" I said in gasping breaths.

""Move forward to what?"" she asks. ""To that empty apartment, Jane left you? To the job you've already lost? To the daughter who won't return your calls?"" My mother replied in a stern tone.

Each word hits like a physical blow. 

""That's not fair.""

""Life isn't and never was fair, Bodie. It never has been. But that doesn't mean you have to face it alone.""

I sat there, pondering what she had just said. ""Life was never fair."" The words left a coppery taste in my mouth. She was right; I did learn that years ago, when I was seventeen, when my father died. The memory came flooding back to that night.

\*\*\*

The flashing red and blue lights pulsed a pattern through the window, lighting up the living room. A knock at the door, and my mother opened it.

Two officers, hats in hands, their faces masks of professional pity. ""*Heart attack*,"" they said. *""Massive.*"" ""At work."" ""*Didn't suffer.""* They offered kind words in hopes of mitigating the sad news; instead, it was like rubbing salt into a fresh wound.

Then came the sound of my mother's shrieking cry. It wasn't just a sound; it was like a physical force. The high-pitched, shattering wail made me wince, curling my shoulders in as if I was taking a beating. It was the sound of a woman being severed from her other half.

A bitter air filled the room, causing me to choke and gasp. I needed to get out of here, get away from this horrible nightmare. I sprinted up the stairs and through the hallway towards my room, desperate to put a door, a wall, or anything between me and the reality downstairs. I threw myself into my room and slammed the door with everything I had.

*WHAM!*

The walls shook. The floorboards vibrated, and the house seemed to groan in pain.

*Clatter*

The silver frame on my dresser fell to the floor. A picture of Dad holding me on his shoulders at the beach, both of us waving and smiling at the camera. A glimpse of my mother in his sunglasses. I walked over, my breath coming in jagged gasps, and picked it up. My thumb traced the engraving, the metal cool against my feverish skin.

""I am always proud of you, son. And I will always love you.""

Always. A cruel, sick joke. There was no always. There was only ""*until his heart stopped*.""

Something inside me snapped. A hot, blinding friction ignited in my chest. I didn't just feel sad; I felt cheated. I felt rage bubbling like a volcano preparing to erupt, ready for fire and ash to cover the world. I spun around and grabbed the lamp off my nightstand, hurling it against the wall. It shattered, but it wasn't enough. I ripped the sheets off my bed, screaming through gritted teeth, tearing at the fabric as if I could tear the grief out of my own body. I kicked my chair over, sending books cascading across the floor, creating a whirlwind of chaos to match the storm inside of me.

I looked down at the frame on my bed. Dad was smiling up at me, frozen in a time that no longer exists.

""It's not fair!"" I screamed, my voice cracking, my throat aching and burning. 

""It's not fair!""

With one last scream, nearly tearing my vocal cords, I picked up the picture and hurled it to the floor.

*CRASH!*

The glass exploded, and the frame splintered, sending a spiderweb of fracture glass across the floor, obliterating the memory.

The bedroom door burst open. I spun around, chest heaving, fists clenched, ready to fight the world. But it was Mom. She stood in the doorway, her face pale and ghostly, her eyes red-rimmed and swollen. She looked at the overturned chair, the shattered lamp, and the broken glass.

Then she looked at me. She didn't yell. She didn't scold. She just rushed forward, stepping over the jagged glass without looking down, and collided with me. She wrapped her arms around me so tight I thought my ribs might crack, but I didn't care.

The fight drained out of me instantly. My legs turned to water, and we sank to the floor together, collapsing into the pile of torn sheets and debris. I buried my face in her shoulder, and I cried like an infant, ugly, heaving sobs that shook my whole body.

""Why?"" I choked out, my voice muffled by her shirt. ""Why him, Mom? He didn't do anything wrong!""

She began to rock me back and forth, a maternal motion. Her hand, trembling slightly, stroked the back of my head, smoothing my hair down.

""He promised,"" I stammered, hitting the floor weakly with my fist, right next to the broken frame.

 ""The frame... it said always. He promised.""

""I know, baby,"" she whispered, her voice cracking. ""I know.""

My mother pulled back just enough to look me in the eye. Tears spilled down her cheeks, tracking through her makeup. She took my face in both of her hands, her palms warm against my cold, tear-streaked skin.

""He meant it,"" she said fiercely, though her voice wavered. ""He meant it, son.""

""Then why isn't he here?"" I demanded, the anger flaring up again for a second before drowning in grief. 

""It's not fair. Everyone else's dad comes home. Why didn't ours?""

She pulled me back into her chest, resting her chin on top of my head. I could feel the vibrations of her own sobs against my skull.

""It isn't fair,"" she admitted, refusing to offer a white lie. She didn't say, '*It's God's plan*' or '*He's in a better place*.' She gave me the only truth she had.

""It is cruel, and it is terrible, and I don't know why. I don't know why his heart stopped. I don't know why we're the ones left here.""

We sat there in the wreckage of my room, surrounded by the shattered memory of my father and the absence of his presence. The silence of the house pressed in on us, heavy like it was also holding us tightly; at that moment, I didn't feel alone.

""We just have to keep living,"" she whispered into my hair, her grip tightening. ""Even when it's not fair. We just have to keep living. We still have each other.""

\*\*\*

""Do you know where we are?"" asked my mother. Her voice snapped me back from the memory.

I looked at her and around the scenery again, trying to find and form any connections to help me figure out where we are. Then I remembered, it was the painting my mother used to paint on a sunny afternoon. I remember watching her paint, each stroke and brush carefully planned and guided. Each line, dot, and color had a purpose, all in unity for the greater goal.

""It's the—the painting you were always working on. You painted all the things you like: the sandy beach lake, the mountains, the pine tree forest, the valley of colored roses, and the bees, butterflies, and dragonflies."" I said, watching her face radiating with a warm smile.

""Correct, Bodie."" She nodded in response.

""But I also remember—"" I faltered. I remember I destroyed the painting.

A young Bodie wanted to add his ""*flair*"" to the painting. What had happened was that I had poured dark red, gray, and black paint on the painting, completely messing up the painting. My mother scolded me angrily; it left me feeling ashamed and angry at myself.

""You did indeed ruin the painting,"" my mother said as she chuckled.

""I was indeed very upset. I felt so bad for yelling at you. You were just a child wanting to make the painting better. I couldn't deny the fact that what was done is done. So I kept the painting and went to work, creating a new masterpiece. Come, let me show you.""

My mother stood up and walked the path back towards the house.

She stopped short in front of the house.

""M-mom? You okay?"" I asked.

""Yes, it's just so nice to see the house again.""

I looked past her at the house and realized the house wasn't in the abandoned shape it was before. The peeling paint was fresh, the shutters fixed, and the hanging gardens full of blooming flowers. We made our way up the steps, and I opened the door. Everything was different, well, different from its previous state.

""Ah, here it is.""

She made her way towards a covered painting that was now mysteriously posted on a stand in the living room by the windows. She pulled off the covers and revealed the painting. The mountains were now gray, the sky had a reddish crimson hue, and the trees were blackened. Everything seemed dead, lifeless, and lonely.

""I'm confused; this is such a stark contrast to the painting before? Everything seems dead and lonely now."" I asked.

""Bodie, this painting is about embracing change, especially if it's something you can't control. Yes, the painting before was full of life and colorful. But let me ask you this, do the seasons stay the same all year long?'

""No""

""We can't control the seasons; they change without our consent. So we embrace the changes; fall is filled with cozy campfires. Winter is cold, and the holidays keep us together to be warm; spring is the start of life again. The summer heat brings memories that last a lifetime. Not everything lasts forever, and when change does happen without our control, what do we do? We do our best with the changes that come; we continue living.""

I looked at the painting again; somehow, the colors didn't seem so intimidating, so bold, and scary. The colors seemed to have softened and made me feel calm. The red sky is now a pinkish hue, leaving a warm, gentle glow. The gray mountain now feels majestic and grand; it stands tall and proud. The trees that were dark now seemed hopeful, almost excited at what will bloom next on their branches and what animals will call them home next.

""I have to pack your things,"" I say. ""I have to sell the house.""

""Do you?"" she asks. ""Or is that just what you think you're supposed to do?""

I don't have an answer for that. The realtor's words echo in my mind, young couples looking for character, the house selling quickly once it's emptied. But sitting here in the strange morning light, watching my mother's face soft with love, I can't imagine letting strangers live in these walls.

""I don't know what I'm supposed to do,"" I admit.

""Then don't do anything,"" she says. ""Just be here. Just let the house show you what you need to see. Here, just sit with me."" She gestured to the empty space on the sofa next to her.

The house began to move, beginning its strange journey again, and through the windows, I watched the world outside shift and change.

""Where are we going?"" I ask.

""Wherever you need to go,"" Mom said. ""The house remembers and knows everything, Bodie. Every joy, every sorrow, every moment of love and loss. It's all here, waiting for you to find it.""

I look around the living room, seeing it with new eyes. The walls seem to pulse with memory, and I can almost hear the echoes of decades past, my own laughter as a child, dad's voice reading bedtime stories, and Mom's gentle humming as she worked in the kitchen.

""I don't want to remember,"" I whisper. ""It hurts too much.""

""I know,"" she says softly.

The house rocks gently, and I feel myself swaying with it. The motion is hypnotic, comforting in a way that nothing has been for months. Outside, the world continues to shift and change. The neighbor's house becomes a field of wildflowers, then a forest, then a house again. I closed my eyes and let myself feel the house's movement. It's taking me somewhere I need to go.

\*\*\*

I must have fallen asleep. I awoke to a dark and empty house. I reached out to feel my mother, but she was gone. Gone like a dream.

""It was a dream."" I sighed.

""I must be going crazy; I need to start cleaning up this house and get it ready for the sale,"" I thought.

I got up and headed towards the kitchen to quench my thirst. The doorbell rang, and I froze in my steps, goosebumps icy on the back of my neck. I slowly turned around and looked at the front door.

""Uh-he-hello?""

Nothing but silence. I shook my head; I must really be losing it. I began to turn back around, and all of a sudden, three loud bangs rattled the front door, nearly splintering it.

""WHAT THE F—WHO'S THERE, DAMMIT!?"" I shouted.

The banging continued, and the house began to rattle and groan. The walls were cracking and splintering. I fell to my knees and tried to block out the noise by covering my ears. It was so loud and violent, I swear my brain was bouncing around in my head, hitting all the corners of my skull, causing an intense migraine.

Then it stopped abruptly; it went silent. The house groaned like it was letting out a sigh of relief. The cracks and splinters of the walls are slowly repairing themselves.

""Is the house alive?"" I said quietly to myself.

""Bodie? Bodie? Open the door for Mummy; let me in!""

I quickly look towards the front door in shock. Mom? Is it really her? Maybe it wasn't a dream after all. I noticed the door was now a dark crimson red color with a faint red hue glowing from under the door.

""Bodie, please open the door for Mummy; it's cold out here. Let me in."" The voice grabbed my attention again.

It was strange; it sounded like Mom, but it was missing something. It was missing her in a way, something trying to mimic her almost perfectly, but falling short because I know my mom's voice.

""Bodie! Bodie! Open the door for Mummy, please!"" The voice said again, but this time a little more raspy and gravelly, like whatever it was was growing tired of keeping up the mimicry.

""Is it really you, Mum?""

""YES, yes, it's me, Mummy. Be a good boy and open the door, please.""

Everything in my body sent signals of danger to whatever was behind the red door. Screaming at me to NOT open the door, no matter what. The house groaned in response, like it was agreeing with me.

""OPEN THE DOOR, YOU UNGRATEFUL BOY."" The voice hissed angrily, and a loud crash came from the front door.

Whatever it was, it was big; the wooden door bulged when it crashed into it, threatening to break it off from its hinges and letting whatever thing that was outside inside the house. I ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife, preparing for whatever was coming through the door.

It kept banging, each crash shaking the house violently and making me wince at every loud crash. The crashing stopped, and a woman's voice shrieked loud enough to shatter glass. Then a woman sobbing and crying began.

""I'm sorry, Bodie, I'm just so scared out here; Mummy is cold, let me in."" The thing was said in my mother's voice.

I can hear it scratching desperately at the door, scratching hard enough to audibly hear the nails scrape and rip off from the thing's hands and the squelch of skin brushing hard against the wooden door. Whatever it is out there, I am not opening the damn door; it's going to have to break it down to get to me.

""Why do you have a knife in your hand, sweetheart? Are you going to hurt Mummy with it?""

I looked to the right side of the front door and into the large living room window that faced outwards from the front of the house. The view was red and black, like my mom's painting after my accident. Everything seemed dead, and a red lightning thunderstorm was angrily brewing outside. The trees danced violently with their sharp branches in the wild winds. The black water formed giant tsunami waves threatening to sweep away the house and flood the entire world.

I saw my mom standing there, or rather, it was something that was portraying itself as my mom. Her blue dress was covered in splotches of crimson red, and it was tattered like a worn, dirty rag. Her hair was long and crazy and whipping around from the wind, forming a spider-like web. Her bloody and broken hands were covering her face beside two eyes with a dirty yellow sclera and dark black iris staring hungrily at me.

""What the Fu—""

The rest of the curse died in my throat as a crack of thunder shook the very foundations of the house. The thing wearing my mother's face didn't flinch.

It just tilted its head, a jagged, jerking motion like a marionette with tangled strings. The yellow eyes widened, the pupils dilating until they were almost entirely black voids.

'Don't you curse Bodie; I didn't raise you that way."" ""The Thing,"" he said, cutting me off sharply.

""You are not my mother; whatever you are, you need to leave,"" I said in a quiet, stern tone. What the hell is this thing pretending to be my mother? What a cruel joke.

I can see the Thing's eyes get big and angry; it begins to twist and shake its body. It looked like it wanted to scream and crash through the window and do whatever it was going to do to me if it ever got in. But it stopped and straightened itself and spoke in a calm, mother-like voice, speaking as a mother does to a child.

""Now, sweetie, why would you say that to Mummy? That wasn't very nice. Come and be a good boy and let your mummy inside.""

I stared at the Thing, not moving and definitely not obeying this Thing's commands.

""You are not my mother,"" I replied, gripping the knife tighter and preparing myself as I continued to defy it.

The Thing's eyes grew large again, and it began removing its hands from its face to reveal a large mouth full of teeth. It shrieks violently, and its hands grow into large claws and begin to strike at the glass, cracking it with every impact.

""HOW DARE YOU DEFY ME! YOU UNGRATEFUL, SPOILED, ROTTEN BOY! ALL THE SACRIFICES I MADE TO RAISE YOU, AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME!"" It screamed and kept clawing at the window; the cracks grew larger and larger.

I kept expecting the windows to break, but they never did. The Thing stopped clawing the windows, and the cracks on the window have repaired themselves. I now see my mother again, this time correctly—well, everything except the eyes.

""I'm sorry, sweetie, I'm just scared; it's scary out here. Please just let me inside, and I can make your favorite salted caramel cookies,"" the Thing said softly.

It was so convincing that I started to reminisce about the cookies. I remember coming home from a bad day at elementary school. Timmy Lucas had just roughed me up, and I was crying and rubbing my bruised cheeks as I walked to the front of the house and opened the door.

The smell of cookies filled my nostrils and instantly halted my crying. The joy of eating cookies made me forget about the pain on my cheeks. I made my way into the kitchen and saw my mom pulling the tray to cool.

""Oh my goodness, Bodie! What happened to your face?!""

I snapped out of the cookie trance and instantly remembered the pain on my cheeks. I began to cry again and told her how Timmy had beaten me up for standing up to him. She calmed me down and gave me an ice pack to compress on my cheek.

""I will go and have a talk with Timmy's mother this evening, and sweetie, I am proud of you for standing up for yourself.""

I smiled at her; it made me feel good. The smell of the cookies grabbed my attention again, and I kept staring at the cookies eagerly to put one in my mouth. Mom must have seen my eyes because she told me to wait a couple of minutes to let the cookies cool before I could have one.

As soon as she left, I hurriedly went and grabbed one and took a bite. The warm, gooey caramel from the salted brownie cookie filled my mouth, instantly relieving the pain in my cheek. I giggled excitedly and went for another one.

The house groaned loudly, and I snapped back to reality. I found myself at the door with my hand on the knob, almost turning it to open. I quickly lurched backwards away from the door, sweating heavily at the realization of how close I was to letting that thing inside.

""NO!"" The Thing screamed and began to wail.

I was shocked at how it almost manipulated me to let it in. What is this thing? And why does it want me, or what does it want with me?

""Get away from here! Leave me alone!"" I shouted.

The thing stopped its wailing and looked at me motionless.

""You are a bad son, a terrible husband, and a horrible father,"" it muttered.

""Wh-what? Did you say?""

""You are a bad son, a terrible husband, and a horrible father."" It repeated monotonously.

""S-stop it! I am not!""

""But you are. A terrible son saw me as a burden to you. You neglected me, you never loved me, and you didn't even stay to hold my hands as I died,"" the Thing continued muttering.

I covered my ears, not wanting to hear this coming from my mother's own voice. Guilt began to consume me. I'm not a bad son, am I?

I was dealing with my rocky marriage with Jane at the time. Truthfully, I didn't like seeing my mother deteriorate; it broke me every time I saw her. How can a strong woman like her become something so hollow and ill, a woman who worked hard and toiled every day, just to simply die and become nothing but dust?

I just couldn't bring myself to accept the reality that this time she wasn't going to pull through. I was hoping that if I could deny the reality of her dying, it would come true, and she would beat the cancer and live.

""You neglected me, Bodie; you left me to die alone. You are a coward and a bad son,"" the Thing's voice muttered in my head, growing louder each time.

""Shut up! Get out of my head! Leave me ALONE!"" I shouted.

""You neglected me. You—""

""I said SHUT UP—""

""NO!"" the thing squalled.

""You are a terrible son; you ruined everything for me. You ruined the painting; you caused nothing but trouble and were a burden to me. I toiled and worked hard every day for you to neglect me in the end like a coward and leave me to die alone and cold.""

I stare at the Thing. I couldn't form a reply; maybe it was right. Tears slowly formed and dripped down from my cheeks.

The Thing laughed; it didn't sound human. It sounded like the screech of the wind outside scraping against the glass—sharp and high-pitched. It was mocking me.

""The painting—you said you weren't mad anymore, and you made the changes to make another masterpiece,"" I said quietly.

""You really believed that?"" The Thing sneered, its head snapping forward on its neck with a sickening crack. It drifted closer, the smell of rot and sulfur growing stronger.

""I said I wasn't mad because you were a sensitive, pathetic child. I lied. Mothers lie to keep the peace.""

One of its tattered, broken-nailed hands raised up, pointing a long, accusing finger at me. The red lightning flashed again, illuminating the malice in those yellow eyes.

""I hated what you did to the painting. You smeared it with your clumsy hands and destroyed the painting. Just like you destroyed me when you decided to barely come and visit me at the hospital. The truth is, you didn't want to see me. You were a coward.""

""Lies. I was going through a divorce with Jane, Emma was having a hard time processing it, and I tried my best to support you."" I replied.

""Jane and Emma,"" the thing hissed, dragging my wife's and daughters' names out like a curse. It took a step forward, its movements disjointed, bones audibly popping with every inch it gained.

""Jane, Emma. They are just excuses, Bodie. Tiny little shields you hide behind to strengthen your excuses. You chose a failing marriage over the woman who gave you life. You let me rot in that hospital bed... alone.""

I squeezed my eyes shut, shaking my head violently. ""No. No, I couldn't stand to see you sick. It was too hard.""

""Too hard for you?"" The voice rose to a shriek, vibrating with the force of the red thunder outside. ""I was the one coughing up blood! I was the one withering away! And you were playing house with a woman who was already leaving you!""

The glass windowpanes shuddered violently, bowing inward with an audible groan, but somehow holding. Black rain and sea spray splattered against the reinforced glass, painting it with streaks of black water. The wind screamed like a banshee through every crack and crevice, threatening to tear the house apart at the seams.

""I was trying my best; I kept on living just like you always told me. We just keep on living.""

""Lies, I told you to make yourself a better man, a better son, but sadly it didn't work, did it? You just grew up to be nothing but a miserable, sad man who cries, ""*Woe is me*”. You became a coward and simply left me till my very last breath. You failed as a husband and father; your wife hates you, and your daughter despises you. Look at you, pathetic; your father hates the man you have become. I hate the man you have become.""

The words cut deep, wounding and paralyzing, making me flinch at every truth she spoke. I am a terrible son; I ran away and left her to die alone, using my shitty marriage and my cowardice as an excuse. I did leave her to die alone.

She called for me and wanted me to hold her hand as she drew her last breath. I refused and ran to hide, to deny the reality of the situation. I was a coward, and I neglected her. Father would hate to see me now, a sad, miserable, pathetic man who failed at everything. Tears swelled in my eyes, now falling freely.

""Tears and apologies won't do you any good, dear; just open the door and let me come inside, and we can fix it together. It's not too late to fix it.""

I looked up at the creature, but was met with my mother's face, her warm smile comforting me. She is right; I can still fix this. I can still be a good son, be a husband again, and be a great father.

""Let me in so I can help you carry this burden you put on yourself. You can fix everything and make it right again.""

""*I can do everything right again.*"" I thought.

I walked towards the door, and the house shook and groaned. A picture frame fell off the wall. It was a picture of my mother and me taken at my high school graduation. I remember that day.

The hot gymnasium air was filled with perfume spray from proud mothers and was salty from the sweat of fathers. The noise of flash photography and families laughing and joy was deafening. Amidst the chaos, I spotted my mother, waiting for me, smiling and happy. Her brown eyes glistened with joy and love. I ran to embrace her.

"" Bodie. You did it.I know you wish dad was here, but you can't change that. I am so proud that you continue living and doing your best! Your dad would be so proud of you.”

Those words rang as a wake-up call from this thing's manipulation held on me. I wiped my tears and looked at my mother, but her eyes weren't brown; it was a dirty yellow sclera with a dark black iris that stared back at me, hungrily. I stopped short of the door.

""No, I cannot let you in; you died, and I can't change that reality. I must embrace reality and stop denying it. Yes, I fail as a son, father, and husband, but I can still change one. I just need to keep living; I still have my daughter.""

The Thing grew angry and began to scream, slowly shifting and changing its shape and form, thrashing at the window and door with claws, hoofs, and fangs.

""LET ME IN! LET ME IN! LET ME IN!"" The Thing screamed as it clashed and crashed around the outside of the house.

The house groaned and began to move, slowly rocking gently away from the thing and leaving the dark mountains, black trees, and red thunderstorms behind. The thing bellowed angrily, sprinting after us like a predator losing its prey. I made my way upstairs, tired from everything, and fell asleep once again to the slow rocking of the house moving.

""I love you, Mom,"" I said and finally drifted to sleep. ",1,1767144730.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I had this job i was working at for 8 years decent enough wage and some responsibilities being a senior member of staff and another job i got in a barista role where i was incharge of opening the place and closing sometimes decent enough hours and decent people. I left both places for this other place

Now this place is like the hit spot in my town for coffee its been around for years and still bring in crowds i thought this place would have better energy, better pay better community considering it was my home town. I found i wasnt in a barista role, i wasnt being paid anymore than the other café and i was apparently expected because of my age to slowly step up and take on a supervisory role now this just wasnt communicated to me at all during the interviews or anything and long story short it just didnt work out in the role which is probably for the best. I never got a contract or anything after a few weeks of 2 shifts a week. Keeping it vague out of respect to the business not to the manager

I could probably go back to the job ive had for 8 years but id rather not so soon and basically admit failure to escape and the other café had already filled my role ive reached out anyway to the manager there in hopes of hopefully returning if a position opens but otherwise I think its best to look else where. But yeah ideally i would find a job like the previous cafe i mention where its relatively calm 90% of the time which would allow me to work on my novel or just read I'm mostly just posting to rant as i cant sleep from worrying about being unemployed and filled with regret about leaving both jobs in the state of the global economy rn. I may delete this post when i wake up tomorrow or it may get deleted 

If anyone is curious i have a degree in photography and am trying to freelance given the events of this all happened around the week before Christmas i hadn't had the opportunity to reach out to clients at this time for work 

Tl;dr i quite 2 decent jobs for the sake of a new job that fell through how should i move forward?  ",2,1767144623.0,careerguidance,1,1.0,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Renting a place off Grant between Alvernon and Swan. Landlord seemed chill during the showing but right before I signed the lease he casually mentioned ""make sure you always lock your doors and windows, there's been some break-ins on this block.""

Didn't think much of it at the time but now everyone I talk to keeps bringing up security. Coworker at my new job asked if I had an alarm system on day two. Guy at the coffee shop on Campbell noticed my out-of-state plates and said ""welcome to Tucson, get a security system."" Neighbor I met taking out trash mentioned someone tried his back gate last month around 3am.

Back where I'm from (Colorado) I had a basic Ring doorbell and that felt excessive. Here people are talking about full alarm systems with monitoring like it's a normal Tuesday purchase.

 is this just Tucson culture where everyone's hypervigilant, or did I actually pick a bad area? The crime map I checked before moving showed Grant corridor as ""moderate"" but nothing crazy. Rent was reasonable which should've been a red flag maybe.

The coworker who mentioned alarms said he uses Protech, local company, been happy with them. But honestly I'm trying to figure out if I even need that or if I'm being paranoid because everyone's gotten in my head.

For people who've lived here a while - what's actually realistic? Do most people have full security setups or are a few vocal people making it seem worse than it is?

Also specifically for the Grant/Alvernon area - should I be concerned or is this So just normal Tucson and I'm overreacting because I'm new? 

Trying to decide if I need to budget for a security system or if locking my doors and not leaving stuff visible in my car is enough. Don't want to waste money on something unnecessary but also don't want to be the idiot who ignored all the warnings.",19,1767144525.0,Tucson,46,0.79,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1pzzxxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_C00kiesandD0ughnuts/comments/1pzzxxs/the_house_that_moved/,The House That Moved,"My phone buzzed with a voicemail notification from my lawyer.

""Mr. Esmond, I'm sorry for your loss, and you have my condolences. But we need to have a discussion regarding the will and the estate of your mother. Please reach out to me as soon as you can.""

I groaned; three weeks seemed long enough to wallow in my sorrow. The world didn't stop; I did. I called back and confirmed a meeting.

I pulled the covers over my head and tried to sleep, but sleep wouldn't come. Instead, I lay awake in my bed, replaying my mother's last words to me. 

She was lying on the hospital bed in her blue patient gown, hooked up to machines like some sick experiment, the sounds of the monitor machine beeping in melancholy tones. I remember her face; it was pale, lacking the blush of life, and her eyes were a dirty yellow sclera with remnants of a hint of brown left in her pupil.

""Bodie, no matter what happens, I know you will be fine. Grief is love with nowhere to go.""

Those words echoed in my head, and my eyes began to swell with tears. I finally passed out.

Now I'm standing in front of the house where I grew up, keys heavy in my palm. The cottage house sits on 7036 Roses Street like a tired old woman, her pastel yellow paint peeling, her burnt umber shutters askew, and the gardens full of weeds and thorns. Mom always said she'd fix up the place ""when she had time."" Time ran out three weeks ago.

I came here to pack things up, to sort through a lifetime of accumulated memories and decide what stays and what goes. The realtor says the house will sell quickly once it's emptied—cottage homes are popular with young couples looking for ""character and a simple vintage feel."" I suppose that's what they call the creaking floorboards and the drafty windows that never quite close properly.

The key turns with familiar resistance. The door swings open, and the smell hits me immediately: lavender, old books, and something inimitably maternal. My legs nearly give out. For a moment, I expect to hear her voice calling from the kitchen, asking if I want tea and to sit down for a conversation.

The silence is absolute.

I set my overnight bag down and looked around. I should start with the kitchen, I think. That's always easiest; dishes and utensils don't carry emotional weight. But my feet carry me instead to the living room, where I sink into Dad's old recliner that sat in the corner. He died when I was seventeen, and Mom never moved the chair.

Next to the chair was a small end table, and on top of it was a family photo of baby me, Mom, and Dad, posing in front of the house. They looked so happy and hopeful of the future, just a young couple who eloped and were ready to spearhead any challenge with their baby boy. They were on top of the world.

I looked around the living room more intently. The furniture was arranged exactly as she'd left it: two chairs positioned facing each other slightly, a small table between them, the afghan draped over the back of the sofa that looked out the front window of the house with a coffee table in front of it, and the stack of romance novels on the table with the reading glasses perched on top of them.

\*\*\*

I close my eyes and try to remember the last conversation we had. It was about Jane, about the divorce. Mom had listened with that patient expression she always wore when I was troubled, her hands folded in her lap.

""Sometimes people grow apart, Bodie,"" she'd said. ""It doesn't mean the love wasn't real.""

I'd wanted to argue, to give an excuse or explanation, but that was simply the truth. Jane and I had become strangers sharing a house, polite and distant, going through the motions of a marriage that had died somewhere along the way. But Mom had a way of cutting through my self-pity with quiet but stern wisdom.

""What about Emma?"" she'd asked. ""Have you talked to her about this?""

Emma. My daughter. Twenty-three years old and brilliant, working at a nonprofit in Boston. She'd stopped returning my calls after the divorce papers were filed. I told myself it was because she was busy, that she needed time to process. But the truth was, I'd failed as a husband, and now I am failing as a father.

\*\*\*

The house settles around me with familiar creaks and sighs. I should make myself something to eat, maybe start going through Mom's possessions. Instead, I find myself walking through the rooms of the house, touching things and taking in the nostalgia of it all.

I made my way up to my old bedroom; it was exactly as I'd left it when I left for college. School trophies on shelves covered in dust, posters of bands I'd loved when music vainly mattered to me, and a desk where I'd written essays and worked on projects that piqued a boy's interest at the time.

Every surface, every corner holds a memory. This house isn't just a building, it was a time capsule of the boy I once was, a physical manifestation of everything I was before life taught me how to lose things.

I sit on the edge of the bed and pull out my phone. Emma's name was on the screen, the last text from her dated three weeks ago: 

""Sorry about Grandma. Let me know if you need anything.""

I'd never responded. What was I supposed to say? That I needed everything? That I was drowning in grief and guilt and couldn't figure out how to be a person anymore? The phone stays in my hand, heavy with unanswered texts.

I'll start packing tomorrow, I decided. Tonight, I just want to sit in this house and remember what it felt like to be whole.

\*\*\*

I awoke at 2:23 AM to the sound of the house moving.

The floorboards beneath me shift and groan with purpose, and the walls seem to breathe around me. I sat up in bed, my heart pounding in my chest, and I listened. The rational part of my mind, the part that spent two decades evaluating insurance claims and calculating risk, immediately offers explanations. Old houses make noise. The heating system could be acting up, causing expansion and contraction in the walls. 

I sat perfectly still, waiting for it to happen again. When it did, five minutes later, I felt a mixture of terror and relief. Terror because houses aren't supposed to move. Relief because it meant I wasn't completely losing my mind.

""Foundation settling,"" I said aloud.

But this isn't settling. This is movement, deliberate and strange, as if the house itself is responding to the emotional turmoil within me. The increasingly frequent motions suggest something uncanny, sometimes a gentle swaying, like being rocked to sleep, and other times a bouncy forward motion, as though the house were walking on invisible legs at a brisk hurrying pace. 

Through the windows, I watch the world outside shift and change. Sometimes it's the neighborhood I remember from childhood, with kids riding bikes and mothers hanging laundry on lines. Sometimes it's the present day, with newer cars and manicured lawns. Sometimes it's something else entirely, rolling hills and distant mountains, as if the house is traveling through landscapes that exist only in dreams.

I grab my phone and turn on the flashlight, stepping carefully into the hallway. The beam cuts through the darkness, revealing walls that look perfectly ordinary. The family photos hang straight in their frames. The runner down the center of the hall lies flat and undisturbed. Yet beneath my feet, the floor continues to shift and sway.

""This isn't happening,"" I whisper to the darkness. ""This is grief. This is stress. This is everything finally catching up with me.""

It must be grief-induced hallucinations. They're common, especially in the first few months after loss. The mind plays tricks when it's overwhelmed by trauma. That's what this is. It has to be.

I make my way downstairs, gripping the banister for support. Each step feels like it's moving beneath me, but the flashlight beam shows everything in its proper place. The living room looks exactly as it did before I went to bed.

I settle into the recliner and close my eyes, focusing on my breathing. In through the nose, out through the mouth. A technique taught to me during one of the marriage counseling sessions with Jane, back when we still believed we could fix what was broken between us.

The house continues its strange journey around me.

\*\*\*

I awoke to silence and stillness; I must have fallen asleep from the stress and panic earlier. I looked around, scanning for any anomaly. I noticed the picture was flipped downward, and I propped it back upright. Everything in the house was the same, except for some items that had fallen to the floor.

I looked around the room and noticed soft sunlight peaking through the windows. I noticed the front door was no longer a dirty white door but a blue color.

I sat for a few seconds to gather myself until I began to hear something like waves crashing. It seems to be coming from behind the door, coming from outside. I got up and made my way towards the blue door, each step shaky, but as I got closer, a warm feeling seemed to soothe me, inviting me to open the door.

I turned the knob and opened the door; the light blinded me, and before me was a valley of lush greenery, roses of all colors spread out in beds, and a sandy dirt path leading through the pine trees to a sandy beach lake with ice-capped mountains looming in the far distant background. I made my way through the path and took a look behind me; there the house sat, almost as if it was smiling at me, like it was happy for me.

As I approached the sandy beach, the sunshine brought warmth to my skin, the cool winds brushed against my hair, the waves from the lake crashed melodically against the shore, and the buzzing of bees, butterflies, and dragonflies of vibrant colors filled the air. I stared in awe, taking in the beauty of the place that stood before me.

""I must be dreaming,"" I said to myself, gasping and pinching myself to make sure.

""All that pinching will leave you red,"" chuckled a familiar voice behind me.

Instantly, I felt goosebumps. Can't it be? That voice was warm and loving. I turned around slowly, and there she was, Mom. She was sitting on the sofa in the house.

She looks exactly as she did ten years ago, before the arthritis bent her fingers and the years painted silver in her hair. She's wearing her favorite dress, the blue one with tiny colored roses that she always wore to church, and she's reading one of her romance novels, lips curved in a small smile.

""Mom?"" The word comes out like a croak.

She looks up, and her face breaks into the warm smile I remember from childhood.

""Bodie, sweetheart. I was wondering when you'd wake up.""

I know this isn't real. I know she's dead; I watched them lower her casket into the ground three weeks ago. But she looks so solid, so present, that I can't help but hope.

""I thought..."" I start, then stop. How do you tell your dead mother that you thought she was dead?

""You thought I was gone,"" she says gently, setting down her book. ""I know, sweetheart. But I'm right here. I've always been right here.""

I can't help but deny what I'm seeing. My voice trembles as I manage to speak: 

""You can't be here,"" I say. ""You're dead. I was there. I held your hand from where you were lying in the casket.""

She gestures calmly for me to sit, as if my protest is just a child refusing to accept bedtime.

I want to. God, I want to sink into that couch and pretend the last three weeks never happened. I want to tell her about the divorce, about how I've messed everything up with Emma, and about how I feel like I'm drowning in my own life. But I can't move. Some part of me knows that if I sit down, if I accept this beautiful lie, I'll never be able to face the truth again.

Her expression doesn't change. ""I'm here now.""

""No."" I shake my head, standing up from the recliner. ""No, you're not. This is grief. This is my mind playing tricks. You're dead, and I'm alone in this house, and I'm losing my mind.""

She watches me with patient eyes. 

""If I'm not real, then what does it matter if you sit with me?""

The question stops me cold. If she's a hallucination, a product of my overwhelming grief, then what harm could there be in indulging it? What's wrong with spending a few minutes in a world where my mother is still alive.

 ""Because if I pretend you're here, then I'll never accept that you're gone. And if I don't accept that you're gone, then I'll never be able to move forward."" I said in gasping breaths.

""Move forward to what?"" she asks. ""To that empty apartment, Jane left you? To the job you've already lost? To the daughter who won't return your calls?"" My mother replied in a stern tone.

Each word hits like a physical blow. 

""That's not fair.""

""Life isn't and never was fair, Bodie. It never has been. But that doesn't mean you have to face it alone.""

I sat there, pondering what she had just said. ""Life was never fair."" The words left a coppery taste in my mouth. She was right; I did learn that years ago, when I was seventeen, when my father died. The memory came flooding back to that night.

\*\*\*

The flashing red and blue lights pulsed a pattern through the window, lighting up the living room. A knock at the door, and my mother opened it.

Two officers, hats in hands, their faces masks of professional pity. ""*Heart attack*,"" they said. *""Massive.*"" ""At work."" ""*Didn't suffer.""* They offered kind words in hopes of mitigating the sad news; instead, it was like rubbing salt into a fresh wound.

Then came the sound of my mother's shrieking cry. It wasn't just a sound; it was like a physical force. The high-pitched, shattering wail made me wince, curling my shoulders in as if I was taking a beating. It was the sound of a woman being severed from her other half.

A bitter air filled the room, causing me to choke and gasp. I needed to get out of here, get away from this horrible nightmare. I sprinted up the stairs and through the hallway towards my room, desperate to put a door, a wall, or anything between me and the reality downstairs. I threw myself into my room and slammed the door with everything I had.

*WHAM!*

The walls shook. The floorboards vibrated, and the house seemed to groan in pain.

*Clatter*

The silver frame on my dresser fell to the floor. A picture of Dad holding me on his shoulders at the beach, both of us waving and smiling at the camera. A glimpse of my mother in his sunglasses. I walked over, my breath coming in jagged gasps, and picked it up. My thumb traced the engraving, the metal cool against my feverish skin.

""I am always proud of you, son. And I will always love you.""

Always. A cruel, sick joke. There was no always. There was only ""*until his heart stopped*.""

Something inside me snapped. A hot, blinding friction ignited in my chest. I didn't just feel sad; I felt cheated. I felt rage bubbling like a volcano preparing to erupt, ready for fire and ash to cover the world. I spun around and grabbed the lamp off my nightstand, hurling it against the wall. It shattered, but it wasn't enough. I ripped the sheets off my bed, screaming through gritted teeth, tearing at the fabric as if I could tear the grief out of my own body. I kicked my chair over, sending books cascading across the floor, creating a whirlwind of chaos to match the storm inside of me.

I looked down at the frame on my bed. Dad was smiling up at me, frozen in a time that no longer exists.

""It's not fair!"" I screamed, my voice cracking, my throat aching and burning. 

""It's not fair!""

With one last scream, nearly tearing my vocal cords, I picked up the picture and hurled it to the floor.

*CRASH!*

The glass exploded, and the frame splintered, sending a spiderweb of fracture glass across the floor, obliterating the memory.

The bedroom door burst open. I spun around, chest heaving, fists clenched, ready to fight the world. But it was Mom. She stood in the doorway, her face pale and ghostly, her eyes red-rimmed and swollen. She looked at the overturned chair, the shattered lamp, and the broken glass.

Then she looked at me. She didn't yell. She didn't scold. She just rushed forward, stepping over the jagged glass without looking down, and collided with me. She wrapped her arms around me so tight I thought my ribs might crack, but I didn't care.

The fight drained out of me instantly. My legs turned to water, and we sank to the floor together, collapsing into the pile of torn sheets and debris. I buried my face in her shoulder, and I cried like an infant, ugly, heaving sobs that shook my whole body.

""Why?"" I choked out, my voice muffled by her shirt. ""Why him, Mom? He didn't do anything wrong!""

She began to rock me back and forth, a maternal motion. Her hand, trembling slightly, stroked the back of my head, smoothing my hair down.

""He promised,"" I stammered, hitting the floor weakly with my fist, right next to the broken frame.

 ""The frame... it said always. He promised.""

""I know, baby,"" she whispered, her voice cracking. ""I know.""

My mother pulled back just enough to look me in the eye. Tears spilled down her cheeks, tracking through her makeup. She took my face in both of her hands, her palms warm against my cold, tear-streaked skin.

""He meant it,"" she said fiercely, though her voice wavered. ""He meant it, son.""

""Then why isn't he here?"" I demanded, the anger flaring up again for a second before drowning in grief. 

""It's not fair. Everyone else's dad comes home. Why didn't ours?""

She pulled me back into her chest, resting her chin on top of my head. I could feel the vibrations of her own sobs against my skull.

""It isn't fair,"" she admitted, refusing to offer a white lie. She didn't say, '*It's God's plan*' or '*He's in a better place*.' She gave me the only truth she had.

""It is cruel, and it is terrible, and I don't know why. I don't know why his heart stopped. I don't know why we're the ones left here.""

We sat there in the wreckage of my room, surrounded by the shattered memory of my father and the absence of his presence. The silence of the house pressed in on us, heavy like it was also holding us tightly; at that moment, I didn't feel alone.

""We just have to keep living,"" she whispered into my hair, her grip tightening. ""Even when it's not fair. We just have to keep living. We still have each other.""

\*\*\*

""Do you know where we are?"" asked my mother. Her voice snapped me back from the memory.

I looked at her and around the scenery again, trying to find and form any connections to help me figure out where we are. Then I remembered, it was the painting my mother used to paint on a sunny afternoon. I remember watching her paint, each stroke and brush carefully planned and guided. Each line, dot, and color had a purpose, all in unity for the greater goal.

""It's the—the painting you were always working on. You painted all the things you like: the sandy beach lake, the mountains, the pine tree forest, the valley of colored roses, and the bees, butterflies, and dragonflies."" I said, watching her face radiating with a warm smile.

""Correct, Bodie."" She nodded in response.

""But I also remember—"" I faltered. I remember I destroyed the painting.

A young Bodie wanted to add his ""*flair*"" to the painting. What had happened was that I had poured dark red, gray, and black paint on the painting, completely messing up the painting. My mother scolded me angrily; it left me feeling ashamed and angry at myself.

""You did indeed ruin the painting,"" my mother said as she chuckled.

""I was indeed very upset. I felt so bad for yelling at you. You were just a child wanting to make the painting better. I couldn't deny the fact that what was done is done. So I kept the painting and went to work, creating a new masterpiece. Come, let me show you.""

My mother stood up and walked the path back towards the house.

She stopped short in front of the house.

""M-mom? You okay?"" I asked.

""Yes, it's just so nice to see the house again.""

I looked past her at the house and realized the house wasn't in the abandoned shape it was before. The peeling paint was fresh, the shutters fixed, and the hanging gardens full of blooming flowers. We made our way up the steps, and I opened the door. Everything was different, well, different from its previous state.

""Ah, here it is.""

She made her way towards a covered painting that was now mysteriously posted on a stand in the living room by the windows. She pulled off the covers and revealed the painting. The mountains were now gray, the sky had a reddish crimson hue, and the trees were blackened. Everything seemed dead, lifeless, and lonely.

""I'm confused; this is such a stark contrast to the painting before? Everything seems dead and lonely now."" I asked.

""Bodie, this painting is about embracing change, especially if it's something you can't control. Yes, the painting before was full of life and colorful. But let me ask you this, do the seasons stay the same all year long?'

""No""

""We can't control the seasons; they change without our consent. So we embrace the changes; fall is filled with cozy campfires. Winter is cold, and the holidays keep us together to be warm; spring is the start of life again. The summer heat brings memories that last a lifetime. Not everything lasts forever, and when change does happen without our control, what do we do? We do our best with the changes that come; we continue living.""

I looked at the painting again; somehow, the colors didn't seem so intimidating, so bold, and scary. The colors seemed to have softened and made me feel calm. The red sky is now a pinkish hue, leaving a warm, gentle glow. The gray mountain now feels majestic and grand; it stands tall and proud. The trees that were dark now seemed hopeful, almost excited at what will bloom next on their branches and what animals will call them home next.

""I have to pack your things,"" I say. ""I have to sell the house.""

""Do you?"" she asks. ""Or is that just what you think you're supposed to do?""

I don't have an answer for that. The realtor's words echo in my mind, young couples looking for character, the house selling quickly once it's emptied. But sitting here in the strange morning light, watching my mother's face soft with love, I can't imagine letting strangers live in these walls.

""I don't know what I'm supposed to do,"" I admit.

""Then don't do anything,"" she says. ""Just be here. Just let the house show you what you need to see. Here, just sit with me."" She gestured to the empty space on the sofa next to her.

The house began to move, beginning its strange journey again, and through the windows, I watched the world outside shift and change.

""Where are we going?"" I ask.

""Wherever you need to go,"" Mom said. ""The house remembers and knows everything, Bodie. Every joy, every sorrow, every moment of love and loss. It's all here, waiting for you to find it.""

I look around the living room, seeing it with new eyes. The walls seem to pulse with memory, and I can almost hear the echoes of decades past, my own laughter as a child, dad's voice reading bedtime stories, and Mom's gentle humming as she worked in the kitchen.

""I don't want to remember,"" I whisper. ""It hurts too much.""

""I know,"" she says softly.

The house rocks gently, and I feel myself swaying with it. The motion is hypnotic, comforting in a way that nothing has been for months. Outside, the world continues to shift and change. The neighbor's house becomes a field of wildflowers, then a forest, then a house again. I closed my eyes and let myself feel the house's movement. It's taking me somewhere I need to go.

\*\*\*

I must have fallen asleep. I awoke to a dark and empty house. I reached out to feel my mother, but she was gone. Gone like a dream.

""It was a dream."" I sighed.

""I must be going crazy; I need to start cleaning up this house and get it ready for the sale,"" I thought.

I got up and headed towards the kitchen to quench my thirst. The doorbell rang, and I froze in my steps, goosebumps icy on the back of my neck. I slowly turned around and looked at the front door.

""Uh-he-hello?""

Nothing but silence. I shook my head; I must really be losing it. I began to turn back around, and all of a sudden, three loud bangs rattled the front door, nearly splintering it.

""WHAT THE F—WHO'S THERE, DAMMIT!?"" I shouted.

The banging continued, and the house began to rattle and groan. The walls were cracking and splintering. I fell to my knees and tried to block out the noise by covering my ears. It was so loud and violent, I swear my brain was bouncing around in my head, hitting all the corners of my skull, causing an intense migraine.

Then it stopped abruptly; it went silent. The house groaned like it was letting out a sigh of relief. The cracks and splinters of the walls are slowly repairing themselves.

""Is the house alive?"" I said quietly to myself.

""Bodie? Bodie? Open the door for Mummy; let me in!""

I quickly look towards the front door in shock. Mom? Is it really her? Maybe it wasn't a dream after all. I noticed the door was now a dark crimson red color with a faint red hue glowing from under the door.

""Bodie, please open the door for Mummy; it's cold out here. Let me in."" The voice grabbed my attention again.

It was strange; it sounded like Mom, but it was missing something. It was missing her in a way, something trying to mimic her almost perfectly, but falling short because I know my mom's voice.

""Bodie! Bodie! Open the door for Mummy, please!"" The voice said again, but this time a little more raspy and gravelly, like whatever it was was growing tired of keeping up the mimicry.

""Is it really you, Mum?""

""YES, yes, it's me, Mummy. Be a good boy and open the door, please.""

Everything in my body sent signals of danger to whatever was behind the red door. Screaming at me to NOT open the door, no matter what. The house groaned in response, like it was agreeing with me.

""OPEN THE DOOR, YOU UNGRATEFUL BOY."" The voice hissed angrily, and a loud crash came from the front door.

Whatever it was, it was big; the wooden door bulged when it crashed into it, threatening to break it off from its hinges and letting whatever thing that was outside inside the house. I ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife, preparing for whatever was coming through the door.

It kept banging, each crash shaking the house violently and making me wince at every loud crash. The crashing stopped, and a woman's voice shrieked loud enough to shatter glass. Then a woman sobbing and crying began.

""I'm sorry, Bodie, I'm just so scared out here; Mummy is cold, let me in."" The thing was said in my mother's voice.

I can hear it scratching desperately at the door, scratching hard enough to audibly hear the nails scrape and rip off from the thing's hands and the squelch of skin brushing hard against the wooden door. Whatever it is out there, I am not opening the damn door; it's going to have to break it down to get to me.

""Why do you have a knife in your hand, sweetheart? Are you going to hurt Mummy with it?""

I looked to the right side of the front door and into the large living room window that faced outwards from the front of the house. The view was red and black, like my mom's painting after my accident. Everything seemed dead, and a red lightning thunderstorm was angrily brewing outside. The trees danced violently with their sharp branches in the wild winds. The black water formed giant tsunami waves threatening to sweep away the house and flood the entire world.

I saw my mom standing there, or rather, it was something that was portraying itself as my mom. Her blue dress was covered in splotches of crimson red, and it was tattered like a worn, dirty rag. Her hair was long and crazy and whipping around from the wind, forming a spider-like web. Her bloody and broken hands were covering her face beside two eyes with a dirty yellow sclera and dark black iris staring hungrily at me.

""What the Fu—""

The rest of the curse died in my throat as a crack of thunder shook the very foundations of the house. The thing wearing my mother's face didn't flinch.

It just tilted its head, a jagged, jerking motion like a marionette with tangled strings. The yellow eyes widened, the pupils dilating until they were almost entirely black voids.

'Don't you curse Bodie; I didn't raise you that way."" ""The Thing,"" he said, cutting me off sharply.

""You are not my mother; whatever you are, you need to leave,"" I said in a quiet, stern tone. What the hell is this thing pretending to be my mother? What a cruel joke.

I can see the Thing's eyes get big and angry; it begins to twist and shake its body. It looked like it wanted to scream and crash through the window and do whatever it was going to do to me if it ever got in. But it stopped and straightened itself and spoke in a calm, mother-like voice, speaking as a mother does to a child.

""Now, sweetie, why would you say that to Mummy? That wasn't very nice. Come and be a good boy and let your mummy inside.""

I stared at the Thing, not moving and definitely not obeying this Thing's commands.

""You are not my mother,"" I replied, gripping the knife tighter and preparing myself as I continued to defy it.

The Thing's eyes grew large again, and it began removing its hands from its face to reveal a large mouth full of teeth. It shrieks violently, and its hands grow into large claws and begin to strike at the glass, cracking it with every impact.

""HOW DARE YOU DEFY ME! YOU UNGRATEFUL, SPOILED, ROTTEN BOY! ALL THE SACRIFICES I MADE TO RAISE YOU, AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME!"" It screamed and kept clawing at the window; the cracks grew larger and larger.

I kept expecting the windows to break, but they never did. The Thing stopped clawing the windows, and the cracks on the window have repaired themselves. I now see my mother again, this time correctly—well, everything except the eyes.

""I'm sorry, sweetie, I'm just scared; it's scary out here. Please just let me inside, and I can make your favorite salted caramel cookies,"" the Thing said softly.

It was so convincing that I started to reminisce about the cookies. I remember coming home from a bad day at elementary school. Timmy Lucas had just roughed me up, and I was crying and rubbing my bruised cheeks as I walked to the front of the house and opened the door.

The smell of cookies filled my nostrils and instantly halted my crying. The joy of eating cookies made me forget about the pain on my cheeks. I made my way into the kitchen and saw my mom pulling the tray to cool.

""Oh my goodness, Bodie! What happened to your face?!""

I snapped out of the cookie trance and instantly remembered the pain on my cheeks. I began to cry again and told her how Timmy had beaten me up for standing up to him. She calmed me down and gave me an ice pack to compress on my cheek.

""I will go and have a talk with Timmy's mother this evening, and sweetie, I am proud of you for standing up for yourself.""

I smiled at her; it made me feel good. The smell of the cookies grabbed my attention again, and I kept staring at the cookies eagerly to put one in my mouth. Mom must have seen my eyes because she told me to wait a couple of minutes to let the cookies cool before I could have one.

As soon as she left, I hurriedly went and grabbed one and took a bite. The warm, gooey caramel from the salted brownie cookie filled my mouth, instantly relieving the pain in my cheek. I giggled excitedly and went for another one.

The house groaned loudly, and I snapped back to reality. I found myself at the door with my hand on the knob, almost turning it to open. I quickly lurched backwards away from the door, sweating heavily at the realization of how close I was to letting that thing inside.

""NO!"" The Thing screamed and began to wail.

I was shocked at how it almost manipulated me to let it in. What is this thing? And why does it want me, or what does it want with me?

""Get away from here! Leave me alone!"" I shouted.

The thing stopped its wailing and looked at me motionless.

""You are a bad son, a terrible husband, and a horrible father,"" it muttered.

""Wh-what? Did you say?""

""You are a bad son, a terrible husband, and a horrible father."" It repeated monotonously.

""S-stop it! I am not!""

""But you are. A terrible son saw me as a burden to you. You neglected me, you never loved me, and you didn't even stay to hold my hands as I died,"" the Thing continued muttering.

I covered my ears, not wanting to hear this coming from my mother's own voice. Guilt began to consume me. I'm not a bad son, am I?

I was dealing with my rocky marriage with Jane at the time. Truthfully, I didn't like seeing my mother deteriorate; it broke me every time I saw her. How can a strong woman like her become something so hollow and ill, a woman who worked hard and toiled every day, just to simply die and become nothing but dust?

I just couldn't bring myself to accept the reality that this time she wasn't going to pull through. I was hoping that if I could deny the reality of her dying, it would come true, and she would beat the cancer and live.

""You neglected me, Bodie; you left me to die alone. You are a coward and a bad son,"" the Thing's voice muttered in my head, growing louder each time.

""Shut up! Get out of my head! Leave me ALONE!"" I shouted.

""You neglected me. You—""

""I said SHUT UP—""

""NO!"" the thing squalled.

""You are a terrible son; you ruined everything for me. You ruined the painting; you caused nothing but trouble and were a burden to me. I toiled and worked hard every day for you to neglect me in the end like a coward and leave me to die alone and cold.""

I stare at the Thing. I couldn't form a reply; maybe it was right. Tears slowly formed and dripped down from my cheeks.

The Thing laughed; it didn't sound human. It sounded like the screech of the wind outside scraping against the glass—sharp and high-pitched. It was mocking me.

""The painting—you said you weren't mad anymore, and you made the changes to make another masterpiece,"" I said quietly.

""You really believed that?"" The Thing sneered, its head snapping forward on its neck with a sickening crack. It drifted closer, the smell of rot and sulfur growing stronger.

""I said I wasn't mad because you were a sensitive, pathetic child. I lied. Mothers lie to keep the peace.""

One of its tattered, broken-nailed hands raised up, pointing a long, accusing finger at me. The red lightning flashed again, illuminating the malice in those yellow eyes.

""I hated what you did to the painting. You smeared it with your clumsy hands and destroyed the painting. Just like you destroyed me when you decided to barely come and visit me at the hospital. The truth is, you didn't want to see me. You were a coward.""

""Lies. I was going through a divorce with Jane, Emma was having a hard time processing it, and I tried my best to support you."" I replied.

""Jane and Emma,"" the thing hissed, dragging my wife's and daughters' names out like a curse. It took a step forward, its movements disjointed, bones audibly popping with every inch it gained.

""Jane, Emma. They are just excuses, Bodie. Tiny little shields you hide behind to strengthen your excuses. You chose a failing marriage over the woman who gave you life. You let me rot in that hospital bed... alone.""

I squeezed my eyes shut, shaking my head violently. ""No. No, I couldn't stand to see you sick. It was too hard.""

""Too hard for you?"" The voice rose to a shriek, vibrating with the force of the red thunder outside. ""I was the one coughing up blood! I was the one withering away! And you were playing house with a woman who was already leaving you!""

The glass windowpanes shuddered violently, bowing inward with an audible groan, but somehow holding. Black rain and sea spray splattered against the reinforced glass, painting it with streaks of black water. The wind screamed like a banshee through every crack and crevice, threatening to tear the house apart at the seams.

""I was trying my best; I kept on living just like you always told me. We just keep on living.""

""Lies, I told you to make yourself a better man, a better son, but sadly it didn't work, did it? You just grew up to be nothing but a miserable, sad man who cries, ""*Woe is me*”. You became a coward and simply left me till my very last breath. You failed as a husband and father; your wife hates you, and your daughter despises you. Look at you, pathetic; your father hates the man you have become. I hate the man you have become.""

The words cut deep, wounding and paralyzing, making me flinch at every truth she spoke. I am a terrible son; I ran away and left her to die alone, using my shitty marriage and my cowardice as an excuse. I did leave her to die alone.

She called for me and wanted me to hold her hand as she drew her last breath. I refused and ran to hide, to deny the reality of the situation. I was a coward, and I neglected her. Father would hate to see me now, a sad, miserable, pathetic man who failed at everything. Tears swelled in my eyes, now falling freely.

""Tears and apologies won't do you any good, dear; just open the door and let me come inside, and we can fix it together. It's not too late to fix it.""

I looked up at the creature, but was met with my mother's face, her warm smile comforting me. She is right; I can still fix this. I can still be a good son, be a husband again, and be a great father.

""Let me in so I can help you carry this burden you put on yourself. You can fix everything and make it right again.""

""*I can do everything right again.*"" I thought.

I walked towards the door, and the house shook and groaned. A picture frame fell off the wall. It was a picture of my mother and me taken at my high school graduation. I remember that day.

The hot gymnasium air was filled with perfume spray from proud mothers and was salty from the sweat of fathers. The noise of flash photography and families laughing and joy was deafening. Amidst the chaos, I spotted my mother, waiting for me, smiling and happy. Her brown eyes glistened with joy and love. I ran to embrace her.

"" Bodie. You did it.I know you wish dad was here, but you can't change that. I am so proud that you continue living and doing your best! Your dad would be so proud of you.”

Those words rang as a wake-up call from this thing's manipulation held on me. I wiped my tears and looked at my mother, but her eyes weren't brown; it was a dirty yellow sclera with a dark black iris that stared back at me, hungrily. I stopped short of the door.

""No, I cannot let you in; you died, and I can't change that reality. I must embrace reality and stop denying it. Yes, I fail as a son, father, and husband, but I can still change one. I just need to keep living; I still have my daughter.""

The Thing grew angry and began to scream, slowly shifting and changing its shape and form, thrashing at the window and door with claws, hoofs, and fangs.

""LET ME IN! LET ME IN! LET ME IN!"" The Thing screamed as it clashed and crashed around the outside of the house.

The house groaned and began to move, slowly rocking gently away from the thing and leaving the dark mountains, black trees, and red thunderstorms behind. The thing bellowed angrily, sprinting after us like a predator losing its prey. I made my way upstairs, tired from everything, and fell asleep once again to the slow rocking of the house moving.

""I love you, Mom,"" I said and finally drifted to sleep.

1pzzxmm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pzzxmm,Need advice on the layout of a huge finished basement,"I'm moving into a house with a huge wide open finished basement. Needing ideas on how to go about the layout.

Main purpose of the space is to host movie nights, game nights, or just be a place where people hang out. I often have a relatively large number of people over, 15+, so I would need different nooks where people can separate as people often don't hang out in one giant group.

So will probably have a big TV and couches down here. I imagine having a coffee table in this area to also serve as a gaming table.

Also, we don't have much storage space in the house other than the closets in the bedrooms and the kitchen cabinets. I was thinking of sectioning off an area and have 1 or 2 wire racks (or an alternative that would look better).

A secondary objective is to possibly have a ""reading area"" where we would have bookshelves and chairs/couches to read on.  Possibly a desk, but maybe not needed. I imagine another coffee table in this area to serve as a second area to game.
