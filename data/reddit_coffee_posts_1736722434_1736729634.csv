My parents suck for other reasons (alcoholic being one of them), but I just realised something. Maybe it’s silly.

My boyfriend and I were watching Parenthood and I said something along the lines of “this only ever happens in movies” when seeing the whole family, or parents, being up with their children for school. He then actually said that this happened with him all the way through highschool - drinking coffee and stuff together. I was pretty shocked by this and was convinced it wasn’t a common occurrence till I googled and reddited around and saw that it’s a real thing.

I’m pretty sure my parents stopped getting up with me around 5th grade. I lived within walkable distance from school so they didn’t have to take me or anything. I recall mornings being hell on Earth, as it was always so cold and I didn’t turn any lights on to not wake up my parents. So I was basically getting ready in the dark, not eating or drinking anything in the morning ever. I would then get out of the apartment quietly and go to school. Basically, all throughout school starting with 5th grade. My father indeed worked shifts but my mum stayed at home.

Mornings are still miserable and very hard for me. I’m honestly wondering if it all stems from there. I was never able to get a morning routine, drink coffee, or tea, or whatever. Maybe it’s because this is something I never experienced? Mornings were just dreadfully quiet, cold, and lonely. And everytime I’d sleep in on the weekends, my parents just said I was a big lazy sleeper.

Mornings are happier now, but I can’t shake off that perception.

It’s obviously such a small piece of the whole thing, but just something that I thought was interesting.

1i01tpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1i01tpd/major_issues/,Major Issues,"My parent's home was built in 2014 with an Eaton 200A load center. About half of the panel has Eaton AFCI (green label) breakers for the bedrooms, laundry/utility, bathrooms, living room,  kitchen, and basement. There are also some GFCI outlets on the AFCI breakers, but they are not AFCI/GFCI breakers, AFCI only.  The washer, dryer, garbage disposal, and dishwasher are not on AFCI breakers.

The issue is that back in November 2024 one of the bedrooms lost power with the breaker on and resetting it fixed the problem. Fast forward to New Year's and the house has intermittently been losing power. My mother says that it started with rooms showing signs of low power. For example, some outlets seemed like they weren't supplying enough current to properly power devices such as the cable box in the living shutting off and my brother says that his PS5 would shut down right after turning on. Also, the hallway lights and lights in my mother's room are dim when they work and flicker or they quit working completely. As the problem worsened they started having multiple AFCI breakers tripping such as bedrooms 3 and 4, the laundry room, and the bathroom next to it. These rooms are all in the same halfway on one level. The back basement AFCI breaker was also tripping. Sometimes they could reset the breakers and the power would work for a few hours or a day or so and then they trip again. Sometimes, while trying to reset the breakers they would trip instantly. They had an electrician come out who only tested the panel and tried to say that all 11 AFCI breakers needed to be replaced. She had another electrician come out who disagreed and replaced the back basement breaker with a standard Eaton breaker (not AFCI which I know is bad). The issue seemed to be resolved for about a day, and the same symptoms reoccurred, except the breaker he replaced no longer trips. Whenever my mother would run the coffee maker in the kitchen (it's a small, cheap coffee pot) it would trip the breaker for her bedroom in the back of the house. Also, when trying to run the washer it tripped the power for 3 other rooms in the house. She says that power fluctuates and causes the lights to dim or not work at all. The 2nd electrician came back and did some troubleshooting inside the panel as well as testing some of the outlets in the house. He concludes that because of the fluctuating power, there is a bad neutral somewhere between the transformer and the meter socket or service entrance. 3 different people from the power company came out and looked at the transformer, and mast, and pulled the meter from the socket. They swear that the issue is not on their end. As you can tell, this issue is more than frustrating and I want to help them get to the bottom of this. We are trying to hold off on having more electricians come out if possible as my parents don't have a lot of money.

She went out with friends the other night and explained everything they were doing when that was an issue in our relationship. Why would you do that now?

My confusion is she acts like nothing has changed. She still wants to talk to each other about our days, text each other throughout our work days, go to the store together, go get coffee and also wants a ""family night"" when we move apart. She also wants me to have a key to her place and post me in her sc.

When we go and do anything she intentionally go out of her way to say stuff like "" this is why we are best friends "" just saying it for no reason at all and it hurts. Like how can you just be okay with that after 4 years?

***Tuesday (4am West Coast Time)***

 *Damn, you may suck ass at infiltration, but I do like your survival instincts, Ranger Rick,* Peta smirked to herself, as Sebastian (or Bass…or Two-Three as he was presently designated) kept sweeping the room with his eyes, searching for her. Well, not her specifically, but even hours after her quarry had returned to their BoO apartment (where Peta came shadow-to-face with every other person in their operation), it was Sebastian who kept scanning the room as if his sixth sense was warning him that *the* ultimate predator was close by.

Thanks to her intel, she’d known before ever laying eyes on him that he’d been a former Texas Ranger who’d moved interstate to go into the private sector. There was definitely a story there, one that might have mirrored her own removal from her original stomping grounds of LA a few years ago. The hat might have retired while he was at work, but he still liked his oversized belt buckles. Depending on how things turned out, she might even look him up and ask him out when all this was over.

Had she mentioned he was cute?

At the time, she’d felt a twinge of guilt that the lookout she’d zotted in the foyer had been sent out for unnecessary blood tests, but at the end of the day, it was only a needle, and he looked tough enough to handle it.

Anthony Montage had met his team at the door, with both men assuring him they were fine. Peta knew he knew that. Any leader worth their salt would’ve been glued to the comms, but it was good that he cared enough to confirm it with his own eyes as soon as the opportunity presented itself.

It did beg the question of why he had been left behind when his team had been sent into the lion’s den, though. That wasn’t how she’d have handled the situation at all.

But as the men embraced, Peta drifted through the shadows and identified Maxine Shaw and Echo One in the war room, as well as three others sleeping in one of the two adjoining apartments. They were Team One. No one else was in attendance.

Maxine was pretty much what Peta expected of a Comms Officer who was a second-generation techno-geek. She was in her mid-twenties, slender, and focused over eighty percent of her attention on her system despite the fact that every member of her team was now in residence. Minor indentations on her cheeks and the sides of her nose suggested long-term use of glasses, which meant she was probably wearing contacts now.

Echo One was definitely an interesting character. His youthful appearance contradicted the knowledge and experience behind pale grey eyes that reminded her of too many Nascerdios. She’d thought she’d seen him staring directly at her more than once but had dismissed it half an hour ago after he’d accidentally scratched his arm against the sharp edge of the table. The laminate in the rental apartment had come away from the timber underneath and caused a thin laceration to appear across the back of one knuckle.

Peta saw her opportunity and moved between the shadows until she reached out a shadow-like tendril without drawing attention. She dragged it across the surface, then dragged it back into the shadows for further analysis. Shifting the tendril back into her fingers, she rubbed them against her thumb, sniffing and then tasting the substance for good measure.

*Definitely mortal mass, and not a hint of essence.* 

As she watched, she learned they worked for Portsmith Electronics, the very same company Helen Portsmith had claimed her husband’s receptionist was trying to destroy from the inside. She had personally never heard of the company before tonight, but it was enough to get the broad strokes. The company was freaking out and covering its proverbial ass, and she couldn’t blame them.

Helen Portsmith was one shady piece of work, and that coming from a divine shadow-walker was saying something.

From her hiding place, Peta listened to their private conversations and what they were doing to get a real feel for this unit and their agenda. She was both pleased and miffed to see the footnotes of her LAPD career had taken up one of the comms woman’s many screens.

Pleased: because their Comms Officer cheered at several of her arrests that had been *barely* this side of legal when the douchebags involved had seen her as a woman to be manipulated and threatened.

Seriously, had that ever worked in anyone’s favor when they were being arrested? The threat of her ‘dying in a Mexican brothel’ part was what had cost one particular perp his balls, though, for the record, he suffered advanced testicular cancer.

(In hindsight, maybe giving him all the physical symptoms of genital herpes triggered by sunlight might have been a tad OTT, but meh. He was still breathing, and given he’d been her first encounter of that type since switching to *that* side of the law, he should be grateful.)

And Miffed: because somehow these guys had access to the LAPD database and accessed HER file! Where the fuck was Nuncio? He *literally* existed to be all over this crap.

Satisfied she had the answers she needed for the moment, Peta extended the range of her shadow movement, pouring out of the one cast by the hood of her reading lamp in the living room cast against the back wall (which had been placed in that position precisely for that reason).

*Home.*

After the crap that went down in LA, Houston had become her new home. She loved her apartment and secretly adored that she was the only one, apart from people working late and cleaners, who could appreciate that gorgeous city view more than sixty stories above the ground every night. It had taken some finagling to get the proper permits to live in what was otherwise deemed ‘office space’, but her family were nothing if not creative when it came to getting what they wanted.

There had been one guy who’d thought he could extort money from her in exchange for making the rezoning ‘a smooth transition’. Unfortunately for him, he’d made the fatal mistake of attempting to blackmail her while her father happened to be following her from the shadows (of all the days for that prick to stick his nose into her business).

Peta hadn’t known he’d been there. Likewise, she hadn’t needed to ask what happened to the government official who went missing straight afterwards because she’d been forced to endure one of her father’s iconic meltdowns for not being the one to rip the guy’s head and spine from his body the way he’d taught her.

But that was ancient history, and tonight she had so much more on her mind. Barely giving the view a second glance, she zoomed in on her open laptop, which was still sitting on her coffee table.

It had been an age since she’d taken a life for personal or even professional gain (though a couple of individuals had certainly pushed that resolve in recent times), and her father lived in eternal hope that she would one day return to his dark fold with the rest of her siblings and nieces and nephews.

*No, thank you.*

It was nice to go to bed without fresh blood on her hands.

She grabbed a beer from the fridge and returned to the laptop, not surprised in the least that as soon as her ass hit the sofa, her system lit up with her cousin’s face (bypassing her need to accept his call).

“So, how’d it go?” Nuncio asked, his eyes sparkling mischievously.

“They had my fucking file, you ass!” she shouted at him.

“Did they?” he asked innocently. “Shit, sorry. Mom’s got me stuck in Puerto Rico, and the only internet I’ve got with me is my phone.” He leaned to one side and pivoted his phone to reveal three sides of an office without a monitor in sight.

Peta winced. That would be like her a hundred years ago, being stuck on a job somewhere with only a toothpick. “No harm. I was just surprised to see these guys with my LAPD records up on their screens.”

“Soooo, back to my original question. How did it go?”

“Still working on it,” she admitted, taking a pull of her beer even as she slid her feet to one end of the sofa and leaned on her elbow to still see the screen. “But you were right. Those assholes were stealing the credit for my fucking work. It looks like it was an innocent play to give them access to this other woman, but I’ll stay on it for a while. The guy who claimed to have retrieved the Lion had no clue what he was talking about, and I want the idiotic genius who put him up to it.”

Nuncio bobbed his head in thoughtful agreement. “Do you want me to hack things from my side and see what I can dig up?”

“Nah, I’ve got it from here. Thanks again for the heads up.”

“Always, cuz. You know where to find me if you need me.”

Peta nodded and reached forward to close the screen with the bottom edge of her beer bottle, knowing Nuncio would terminate the call from his side if that motion didn’t automatically sever the connection. She then rolled onto her back and stared at the ceiling, mulling over the problem as she saw it.

\* \* \*

Nuncio hit the disconnect button, then clapped and wriggled and giggled until he was delirious from his triumph. He’d deliberately dragged his chair to the other side of his desk so she wouldn’t see the wall of monitors that usually sat behind him. Even though they only showed footage of the worksite, Peta would know he could have manipulated their feeds to see anything he wanted.

He hadn’t technically lied to her, though. As much as he wanted to oversee what was going on in California himself, there was only so much he could do with his phone from Puerto Rico, so putting a former world-class assassin in four-inch stiletto heels over there was the next best thing. And for the *coup de grace,* all he’d had to do was send her the link to the site he himself had created, and her own righteous indignation had taken care of the rest.

She’d forgive him when she found out *he* was the *evil* genius she was looking for …

*… eventually.*

1i01rrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i01rrt/i_am_just_an_insecure_cuckoo/,I am just an insecure cuckoo?,"I need some advice and perspective on my relationship. My partner and I have been trying to reconcile over the past two weeks after a breakup. Our history has been rocky, and my trust in him is low for several reasons:

1. In the past, he has admitted to cheating on previous partners.
2. While we were together, I found him liking thirst traps of his exes and women he’s previously hooked up with, as well as being flirty and touchy/feely with other women (he chalks flirting up to being part of his latino culture, and also that he has to get lots of coffees and happy hours with women because of his job)
3. He follows and engages with a lot of “baddie” women (both local to us and influencer types) on social media, liking their bikini photos, thirst traps, and stories. I admit I know this because after I saw him engaging with his ex I looked at his other followers.
4. After a breakup in the fall he immediately got back on tinder, and never deactivated it when we got back together until a friend of mine pointed out he was on there.
4. After our last breakup, he slept with a bartender I could tell he was into while we were together.

We’re currently working on rebuilding things, but I’m struggling with two recent situations:

1. He refuses to add me back on Instagram, saying it’s because he doesn’t want me “surveilling him.” He claims I’ll just get jealous and upset. He says we need to build trust first before he wants to reconnect on socials.
2. Last night, he told me he was going to his friend’s new nightclub opening for an hour, but he stayed until 3 a.m. I later saw stories from the event where he was talking really closely with a couple of women. (Yes, I was watching social media for this stuff 😭)

I feel so insecure, and I hate feeling this way. But at the same time, I think his behavior is contributing to my lack of trust. He says I’m insecure and that I need to own my own feelings because he’s not doing anything wrong, and that I don’t understand his culture. I don’t know if he’s right that I’m being unreasonable or if my concerns are valid.

Am I wrong for feeling weird about all of this? How would you handle this situation?

**TL;DR; : My partner has a history of boundary-pushing behavior, including liking thirst traps, being flirty, and engaging with his exes and other women on social media. After our recent breakup, he slept with someone i suspected he was interested in while we were together. We are now trying to reconcile, but he refuses to add me back on Instagram, citing concerns I will “surveil” him, and recently stayed out late at a nightclub opening, talking closely to other women, despite saying he’d only be out for an hour. I feel insecure and wonders if my concerns are valid or if I’m being unreasonable, especially since he says I don’t understand his culture and needs to own my own feelings.

Breakfast - Coffee. Ive started eating fruit or a pancake because of increased exercise. (maybe 100 cals) 

Lunch - beans, rice, veg, tofu (500ish cals)

To be fair the EPG's are acceptable for UK and US channels but scrolling through my 200+ favorites is a chore. 


So I've settled on two websites, one of which is also a mobile app, for my EPG's. For US Sports it's the well known livesportsontv.com. The second one (which is also a mobile app) is tv24.co.uk. The former is obviously only sports whilst the latter is for every UK channel including sports. However if you decide to use the UK one I recommend using Virgin London as the provider to trim the channels down. If you do ""National Extended"" you'll end up with garbage local channels trying to load. Using the UK one will also give you most of your US sports too, in addition to UK, European and other international sports with maybe less traffic (and buffering) on the servers. 


So the old school part is simple. I have both websites bookmarked and  permanently open in TV Bro. I check the channel/ program/event I want to watch, click home, open my IPTV player, search for the channel and I'm done. Just like the good old days of having TV Guide on the coffee table. 


Hopefully this will be helpful to others in the community.

Looking for some insight as to what this could possibly be. I am a 31F, and I take Buspar and Sertraline, plus Rosuvastatin for medications. Of note, I had a previous 3.4 cm cyst on my left ovary, and my mom passed away pretty traumatically 5 years ago. I am receiving therapy for grief, and I have an anxiety disorder. 

For the past five-ish years, I have been having lower abdominal pain. It’s crampy, usually, and it feels like it is focused in and or around my hips. I was initially told it was anxiety, and I should “be less anxious.” When this did not work, I was referred to OB by my PCP multiple times — have had multiple normal transvaginal ultrasounds. Birth control also did not clear it up. I was tested for PCOS, and put on metformin which helped me lose about 20 pounds, but was taken off Metformin and told my testosterone was normal so I did not have PCOS. The OB I saw last floated an endometriosis diagnosis but discouraged surgery “just for the sake of surgery.” My periods are not normal — they are anywhere from 28 to 50 day cycles, and they are PAINFUL, but I have never gone into the ER about it because what is an ER doc going to do that I could not try at home? I have also in the past had rectal pain while having bowel movements on my period, and I have had pain with sex in the past but assumed it was me not being into it or being in a weird position. 

In the past, the abdominal pain has caused the frequency of my bowels to change, and I have occasional mucus in my stools. This lasted for about a year but cleared up on its own (this cleared up around the time I went on more anxiety medication, to be honest). I do not experience nausea or constipation, blood in my stools, or any kind of weight loss. My appetite has not changed. I do not get fevers with it either. I am able to continue working out and lifting weights. I do have lower back pain, but that has felt constant, for years. I also get hemorrhoids. 

Now, the pain has become focalized around my LLQ, near my hip. It is not painful all the time, and it feels like the pain radiates into my hip and sits there. There are occasional lightning bolts of pain in my vagina. The pain is worse at night. The pain is potentially also accompanied by pressure, but I can move and eat and poop normally. The pain feels deep, if that makes sense. I have bowel movements once or twice a day, depending on coffee consumption, and they are solid. Still no fever, no nausea, no blood in my bowel movements. I am still lifting weights. My new PCP ordered a CT scan. 

I am wondering what she could be looking for? And if I should ask for a referral to a GI doc? I’m lost, and I’m worried, and I would be grateful for any assistance. I have been dealing with this for years, and I am tired. ",1,1736728775.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1i01mor,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/1i01mor/potential_kidnapping_attempt_at_dundas_square/,POTENTIAL KIDNAPPING ATTEMPT AT DUNDAS SQUARE,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share a scary experience my friends and I had this past Friday night at Dundas Square to warn others. I’m 18F, and I was with two friends (both 19M) and my boyfriend (19M). We had just exited the subway and climbed the stairs, and there he was—a random guy standing there who immediately started talking to us. At first, we honestly thought he was just a homeless man, as we’ve always tried to be kind to people in similar situations. We regularly try to buy coffee or offer cigarettes to people who are homeless, and we know how lonely it can get on the streets, so we always make an effort to talk.

But things quickly felt off when he started offering us food, drinks, alcohol, and weed. At first, we thought it was just a sketchy situation, but we knew we could defend ourselves if someone turned violent. We were really broke, so we decided to go along with it thinking we weren’t in immediate danger. He ended up spending $50 on weed and smoked with my friends, but he kept focusing on me. Despite repeatedly telling him I didn’t smoke, he kept pushing me to try it. My boyfriend doesn’t smoke, so the guy started trying to get him drunk instead, constantly offering to buy him alcohol. It felt like he was really intent on getting us all under the influence.

Then, he insisted we all go to a movie. He mentioned that he had just gotten out of prison and was really eager to watch something with us. We reluctantly agreed, thinking we might get a free movie out of it (in hindsight, bad decision, I know). When we got to the theater in the mall and found out it was closed, things got even sketchier. He asked to take a group photo to “show the cinema they lost customers.” By that point, we didn’t want to be around him anymore, so we covered our faces. I was hiding behind my boyfriend and threw up a peace sign to block my face, but he kept adjusting the angle, clearly trying to get a shot of me specifically.

After that, he offered to “get cars” to take us to another theater. We were done by then and said no, but he followed us the whole time, pressuring us to go with him. When we started saying no, he started trying to intimidate us, throwing around Toronto slang and trying to act gangster, as if he thought that would scare us into agreeing. We decided to head toward TMU (Toronto Metropolitan University) because it seemed safer with more people around. I was sick with pneumonia and have asthma, so I slowed down a bit, and that’s when things got really scary. He noticed I was lagging behind and started speed walking toward me, like he was waiting for an opportunity. I yelled out to my friends, and as soon as they turned toward me, he backed off.

We eventually reached a courtyard where people were playing hockey, and we finally felt safe because there were others around. What really freaked us out was how he stopped right at the edge of the courtyard and didn’t step in, like he knew exactly where security cameras or guards might be. He stood there, yelling for us to come back, but didn’t follow us further.

At one point, while we were still in the mall near the movie theater, we saw a security guard in the lobby. We asked if they could help us in any way, explaining the situation. We even offered to hit my vape inside or just pretend to argue with him so they could pretend to call the cops, just to scare him off without us having to escalate things or get physical. Unfortunately, the security guards refused, saying, “My supervisor isn’t here and I don’t want to get involved.” I understand that people can be scary and unpredictable, but it was really frustrating that no one stepped in to help us.

Looking back, it’s clear he was trying to get us under the influence and lure us into a “car” he kept mentioning. He might have assumed we were underage, but we’re just broke college students who made a bad decision. Thankfully, we’re okay, but it was a close call, and I want to warn everyone to stay alert, especially around Dundas Square.

I know we were dumb for going along with him for the free stuff, but we learned our lesson. Please trust your instincts and get away from anyone who seems overly pushy or sketchy.

TL;DR:
On Friday night, a random guy at Dundas Square tried to lure me and my friends (2M, 1BF) with free alcohol, weed, and a movie, but his behavior quickly turned sketchy. He pressured us to get in his car, tried to intimidate us with Toronto slang and act gangster, and followed us until we found safety. Security wouldn’t help, but we eventually got away. Be cautious, trust your instincts, and stay safe in downtown Toronto!

Feel free to share this with friends who hang out downtown. If anyone’s had a similar experience, please comment—it’d be helpful to know if this guy has approached others.

Wife and I are debating moving out of our home in north OC to be closer to some of her family (they are in the Del Mar/Carmel Valley area). North SD or South OC would be the midpoint for our families, but we're both unfamiliar with north SD by and large.

We'd need 4+ bedrooms (we both work from home, kid, dog, family will visit, etc), 2.5+ bathrooms, and over 2000 square feet. Ideally not a super old house and something with a functional yard. Good schools and safety are a must. I would LOVE an area that isn't crazy windy (kiddo gets bad allergies where we are now), but I don't think this will be a huge issue.

Our budget is pretty variable. I would love to get away under 1.2m but I know that may not be reasonable for some of our criteria. We can go up to 1.5-1.6 for the perfect house but I'd prefer not to if possible.

We drove around randomly in Vista and San Marcos for a bit but nothing popped. The San Elijo Hills area did seem nice, but those homes seemed like they might be higher on the budget. We also stopped in Oceanside for coffee and the downtown seemed cool though varied (like any other downtown). I'm not familiar with Oceanside east of the 5 (maybe some areas that might work?), don't want to be above the 76, and it seems Carlsbad may be priced out. I've heard Escondido may not be the best area for our needs as well.

Any advice on areas to keep an eye on or drive around would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!",0,1736728453.0,northcounty,1,0.5,False
1i01kfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i01kfq/chapter_4_now_what/,Chapter 4: Now What?,"The Cabinet Room, 9:20 am

The Cabinet Room was quiet. The President’s speech had finished a few moments ago. The room was full to the brim with members of Congress, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the rest of the cabinet. Extra chairs were brought in, but there was not enough room, so people had to stand. The TV was set to MSNBC, and videos from all over the US were being shown. The damage and destruction were on full display.

The door opened and the President walked in. Everyone in the room stands out of respect. Seth takes a moment to scan the room to ensure everyone is here to start the meeting. “Hello everyone, please sit down everyone, let's cut to the chase” After greeting the men and women, they all sit back down. “We are in a dire situation people, please change the screen” Seth orders an aide to switch the TV to a different channel to begin.

“General, I think it would be best for you to begin,” Seth says, gesturing to a General named Charlie A. Jefferson. “You may begin when you're ready”

The general gives a little nod and stands next to the TV. “Thank You, sir. Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like you all to take a look at these photos. Before I show them I want to make it clear that at this moment, these are Classified. The Photos shown to the public will be very different from the ones shown here. Lights please.” another aide turns off the lights and hits a button for the window blackout shutters to close. The sudden darkness takes people's eyes a minute to adjust.

“First I want to discuss protecting our maritime borders, including the addition of Canada, Mexico, Central America, and so on. It has grown significantly. For this, I suggest creating one massive border that goes 30 miles from shore and loops around like an oval.” He changed the screen to a photo of the new maritime border and an outline appears of the suggestion.

“Now to be able to achieve such a feat in protecting this border, both the Coast Guard and Navy will need much more additional resources. Such as ships, personnel, supplies, fuel, intel, and more. The problem is in preparation for The Storm, most of our Naval assets were docked or moved closer in together to protect them. Mainly the ones that are difficult to replace.” He pauses for a short second so people can understand.

The General changes the picture again “As we speak more and more video evidence shows something came down from the sun and struck the Earth in lines, very specific and precise lines. All ships on said lines are now heavily damaged or sunk. And the ones near it to heat damage.” He changed the image on the screen to several photos and videos of ships severely damaged or now sunk. Some snapped in two, glowing a hot purple color. One of the ships now in two was an aircraft carrier, “Thankfully the only sunk Aircraft Carrier in our fleet was this one here” The picture changes to a closer picture. “The USS Carl Vinson”. The carrier is completely in two. “This carrier is beyond repair and will be used for spare parts.”

The members in the room chatter amongst themselves over the news of the ships. The General waited patiently before continuing to speak. “Now, the good news is that the ships we need to patrol our new border are still afloat, the problem is that it is going to take time to repair them. Especially depending on the damage done.”

“Now on to the two landmasses the President discussed in his speech” The picture changes to a detailed map of the new planet.

Seth gives a subtle cough to chime in, “General, I would like to take it here for a second if that's alright.”

“Yes Sir, Mister President” The General takes his seat.

“Now I want all of you to look at this map. Does it look familiar to anyone?” Seth asks the men and Women in the room. He lets that question hang in the air, some confused at this map, some studying it.

If you have been practically living under a rock for the last 10 or so years, or just haven't watched any major TV show then you wouldn’t understand. But Seth knows that some of them must know what he's referring to. The room remains silent as the occupants study the map.

He inconspicuously looks at each one of their faces, then he sees it. On the House Minority Leader of the Bull-Moose Party's face. Liz Cheney. He watches as she quickly connects the dots in her head. She looks at him, then back to the screen, back at him “Mister President, is that what I think that is?” She asks. Everyone in the room looks at her, then him.

Seth gives a little chuckle “Glad to know I’m not the only one seeing it, I thought I was going a little crazy. Anyone else want to take a crack at it?” Everyone stays silent, some shake their heads. “Alright, General next slide please.”

The picture changes to a map. But this one is much more detailed, with wording and landmarks. The two continents are named “Westeros” and “Essos”. And at the bottom “The world of “A Song of Ice and Fire” and “Game Of Thrones "" in an old writing font. Now everyone is understanding what this world is, everyone connecting the dots, and many “Oohhhhh” coming from a few.

“Now do all of you see it?” Seth asks, looking around the room.

The general continues his presentation, “The images are almost identical, some bits and pieces of detail are off. But other than that, the same.”

“So what does this mean? Are we stuck here?” Ted Cruz, Senate Minority Leader asked in confusion.

Looking over to the senate leader, “At the moment. We do not know. But the good news is that we know where we are. Planetos, from Game Of Thrones.” The General answered the leader's question, as well hoping to calm people's nerves.

Just hearing it aloud is quite a shock to most, just the idea of a fictional story being a reality is amazing in itself. The Congress leaders begin to discuss the steps to get ahead of the panic that will most likely start when news gets out. The idea of a new government budget gets thrown around. Increasing military spending, where the money will come from, increasing taxes, which federal programs need more money and ones that need to be put on hold. What about the foreign trade that will no longer be coming in, what about those resources?

Religion was another thing that was brought up. What do you do with the highly religious people in the country? How do you keep them calm and not go insane? No Pope, no Mecca, no Jerusalem. Important places for these major religions are all gone. All these foundations were just uprooted overnight.

The Cabinet Room gets louder and louder as people try to speak over one another, ideas left and right. “Lower Taxes” “Raise Taxes” and “Military control” The words “Martial Law” were thrown around a few times. Just everyone getting louder.

“Everyone, please! We must go through this rationally. We will get through this” Seth, now standing trying to calm everyone down.

“How do you expect the public to react? You already told them they were no longer on Earth! Now how do you think they're going to react when they find out that we are on a goddamn fantasy planet. This is insane!” Miss Greene spurts out in her crazy tone that she usually saves for the media. “I guess the stress is getting to her now.” Seth thinks, looking at the congresswoman.

“For now, Congresswoman.” Giving her a look before scanning the room. “We tell the public one thing, the truth. We can’t have speculation and fear take over.”

The news breaks, 3:20 pm, 6 hours later

Americans all over the country are still trying to get over the President's speech. Places of worship from the big cities to small towns are being flocked to. Looking for comfort in the fact their lives have been forever changed. Speculation and conspiracies are rampant as very little information besides the speech is released. Like a slowly dripping faucet.

The news media at the moment is documenting the damage and destruction from The Storm. Social Media is still up and running as young citizens try to find comfort in cyberspace. Each documents their experience, feelings, and next course of action in a search for some form of normalcy.

NASA has been given the go-ahead to give updates on the ISS and its Crew. The country sighs relief in knowing that the astronauts are safe and sound. Along with this, the info as to what happened to the Russian cosmonauts is also released, along with the video.

More and more reports of people vanishing out of thin air during The Storm make big news. Footage from bunker sites all over the country is shown to the public of men, women, and children turning into light and vanishing before people's eyes. Just like the Cosmonauts. The videos are practically identical. Before The Storm everyone is calm and prepared, then The Storm hits followed by shaking then the light, and they vanish.

**CNN**: “The US government at this time has no comment as to why these people simply vanished. But they say that they are looking into it.”

**MSNBC**: “The official government website now says for everyone to have at least enough food and water for you and your family. Instructions have been posted on how to extend them in case of emergency.”

**Fox News**: “Now the government is saying we need to be on a “Work from Home” schedule to save gas and diesel. I mean come on! The damage to the economy alone is going to be chaos. What we should be doing is mandating more people to work, more people in factories producing everything we need. Not being a bunch of wimps and hiding at home. I bet this would have never happened if the Republicans never lost the election.”

**ABC News**: “We are getting numerous reports of power outages across the country. Law enforcement in some areas stated that whole power grids for isolated areas are completely fried. Seattle, Washington State is reported to almost be completely out of power as lines are down, neighboring states of Oregon and Idaho have said that they will send in supplies and trucks to help with the damages as they are not too badly damaged. We will have more shortly”

**CBS News**: “So far the following states have opened up their bunkers 6-month supplies to the public at rationing: Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Maine, Utah, Kansas, Alabama, South Carolina, and Arizona. More are expected to follow. The Department of Transportation has been ordered to organize a nationwide “Bus Shuttle” system for businesses to save gas from civilian cars.

As news outlets are relaying what is happening around the country, more information about this strange planet is released.

“Welcome back, My name is Wolf Blitzer with CNN and we have Breaking News. The US Government has just released its information of this world we have been, frankly transported to.” The Anchor turns to a TV screen next to him, it goes from the CNN logo to a map. “And as you can see here, almost the entirety of North America is here with us, just as the President said in his speech earlier this morning. And here.” The Anchor zooms out more for the full image, “This is the complete map we have now. And as you can. See. here.” He stops speaking and studies the map.

“Uh. Uh hmm. Sorry folks, I think someone gave us the wrong ma-” Before he finishes, he presses on the earpiece and listens. “It’s what?” “Are you sure?” “This isn’t a joke right?” “Oh.” The anchor turns back to the camera, bewilderment on his face. “Well uh, folks. This is, I guess, exactly what it looks like. If you have watched the hit show “Game of Thrones” then you will recognize this land mass here.” He circles and points to the closest landmass, “My producer is saying this isn't a joke, but this is Westeros. Yes, that one.” Looking over to the side of someone away from the camera. “Are you sure this is what the government released?”

More and more information is released. The information seems fake at first like someone screwed up and gave the wrong file to someone. Or an office prank? But no, this is legit. The media goes into a frenzy with this information, the theories become wilder and wilder. Social Media is having an absolute field day as well, LARPing is trending on Twitter. So many questions that don’t have answers are being asked on every corner of the internet. But one common question is being asked: “Where is George R. R. Martin?”

Reports on Social Media in New Jersey of helicopters flying overhead, like a swarm of bees in search of flowers. The speculation has been narrowed down to one thing. They're going to get George R.R. Martin.

4:45 pm, Rural New Jersey, Home of GRRM

Rural New Jersey, far from major cities and the hustle and bustle of civilization. Home to big, cheap plots of land. One such plot is homed to the famed writer George R.R. Martin, bought before The Storm. At least that's what the file says.

Sitting in the Blackhawk helicopter, a soldier turns the final page of the personnel file and hands it back to the front. A group of 5 helicopters, four of which are Blackhawks. The first one is a civilian model. They have orders to bring the writer to D.C. by any means necessary. No contact with the writer has been established, the phones ringing but no one's answering. He was last seen with his wife arriving at his home, a 25-acre plot of land from the closest bunker.

“3 Minutes from landing! Look alive!” The pilot reports to the soldiers.

Looking out the window, they approach a massive home. Looking like a 4-5 room size maybe more. The helicopter flies around it twice to get a lay of the land. The civilian helicopter lands 25 yards from the door, then the first Blackhawk helicopter 15 yards from the civilian.

“Alright, everyone!” A military captain yells to get everyone's attention on the headsets. “We go in, get the writer and his wife then we get the hell out. Got it?”

“Yes Sir!” The other soldiers reply. The sliding door to the helicopter opens and they exit. 10 yards from the front door, an officer and two military MPs stand waiting for the soldiers. The officer gives them a nod of approval and makes his way to the door, the squad of soldiers staying a few paces behind.

*Ding Dong*. The officer presses the doorbell. Nothing. He presses it again. Still nothing.

The officer reaches his hand to the door and knocks, the door creaks open. The hinges, with years of wear and tear, make a scraping noise. Something out of a horror movie. Poking his head in to take a look around. Nothing. Then a small gust of air hits him. It's cold.

“Captain, split your group into two and search the building.” The officer speaks on the radio. Looking back, he watches as the 10 soldiers and their captain make their way to him and through the door.

The first group makes their way up the stairs to the second floor. Searching and going from room to room. Each is either a guest room or a storage room, which is odd for a house this size. The last room is the master bedroom. The door was cracked open, and a smell was coming from it. Foul smelling. A soldier, weapon in hand, pushes the door open with the muzzle of the rifle. What he finds is not a pretty sight.

Mister Martin's wife, Parris McBride, dead. She was slumped on her back in a pool of blood. Her throat was cut to the bone.

Two other soldiers enter, still in defense, and search the room. No one was in it. Searching the room for some kind of entry, footprints, a weapon, something to give evidence of an attacker. But there was nothing.

“Captain, we have a body up here. It's the writer's wife. She's dead. Throat cut.” The soldier who found her reports on the radio.

The radio comes to life, “Shit. Alright stay there, I will be up there in a minute. The second team is about to make it to the study.”

Before continuing his task, the captain looks around the living room. It's a mess, trash thrown about. Torn up magazines, and destroyed dishes. Just a mess. Looking over to the other group, he hands signals to make their way to the study.

They entire a short hallway, and the end had a sign on the door “Study room” hanging by a nail. The captain readies his weapon, “Open it.”

Another soldier, on the right side of the door, slowly turns the handle to open it. The Captain kicks the door open and sweeps the area for any hostels, A soldier enters right after him doing the same. What they find is worse than they could imagine.

Blood. Blood covering the floor, splatters on the walls, almost everything. There's a body, sprawled on the floor. Its lifeless eyes staring at the ceiling glossed over. The Captain walks over and neels a little to examine the corps. On the right side of its chest is a hole. About the size of a silver dollar. Looks down in dismay. “Shit” He takes his hand and closes the eyes of the now-deceased body of their target of extraction. George R.R. Martin. Looking around the room for any signs of a struggle.

The room was ransacked, shelves destroyed, notebooks ripped to pieces, many more clearly missing. The computer that was once on the desk smashed to pieces, unsalvageable. “Command. Come in.” The captain presses down on his radio. He waits for a response.

“Go ahead, captain.” A feminine voice replies, authoritative.

“We are inside the occupancy. We have two bodies, one upstairs and the other in the study, both deceased for some time. No signs of entry. The study is ransacked and destroyed. No sign of forced entry. Not even signs of footprints.” The Captain informs.

“Alright Captain, stay there. Don’t touch anything, we have people on their way to handle and examine the scene”

“Yes ma’am.” Giving one more look around the study.

“God fucking damn it”

**MSNBC**: “We have Breaking News. The famed author, TV writer, and producer George R.R. Martin and his wife, Parris McBride were found dead this afternoon in their New Jersey home at 4:50 pm Eastern time. At this time local and government authorities have not given a cause of death. The government has said they wanted his help to determine their next course of action on “Planetos”. Mister Martin was 77 years old.”

4 days later. October 23rd, 2025 9:00 A.M. EST “Announcement of contact mission”

Upon the report of the death of George R.R. Martin, the US government decided to go ahead with a “First Contact Mission” to the continent named “Westeros”. The details of this Mission so far have been kept from the public as to not add more fuel to the fire. Efforts to help throughout the country have been going ahead of schedule so far. Local and state governments have been coordinating to get people the food and supplies they need.

General Motors, Sellantis, and the Ford Motor Company have been ordered to halt production on new vehicles for the time being and put efforts into parts and equipment the country needs. As well as oil production machinery. This includes the former foreign manufacturers that have major offices in the country such as American Honda Motor, Toyota USA, and Hyundai USA, etc.

So far the search of known Oil deposits in the former Canada and Mexico have been proven successful. But since the original infrastructure is gone, the timeline to get those Oil Refineries up and running has not been determined yet. ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips have reported that the reservoirs in the two former countries are there, but they need time to find out how much is there. And without the existing infrastructure to be able to extract, the timeframe is uncertain.

The Whitehouse has been a very busy place for the last few days. Even More so since the contact mission announcement. The discussion is to take place in the Oval Office, at the moment chiefs of staff, Cabinet members, and military leaders are waiting for the president to join them. Many start to brainstorm how to move forward.

“If the satellite map is correct, why not just go straight to Kings Landing with a contact fleet?” A woman questions.

“No No. We do not want to give too much away. If we go straight to the capital and say “Hi! We are not from this planet and just stumbled upon this place, also our home is on the other side of the continent.” it will look suspicious” The Secretary of State, Peter Lynch says to her. The bags under his eyes say he hasn't slept well in a few days.

“Good point. So we just play dumb the entire time? What if we’re not at the right time? I mean as to the books. We could be hundreds of years before the originals, or hundreds of years in the future.” The Secretary of Commerce, Abigail Cross, has been trying to attain as much knowledge as she can about this fantasy world. With one of the books by her bedside every night.

Sipping on his cup of black coffee, “Well we won’t know until we meet them first now will we.”

The door to the Oval Office opens, letting the president walk in. Coffee in hand, with a dog at his side. The dog, a blue and white Stafford Bull Terrier, three to four years old named “Eco” usually goes everywhere with his owner. Except for the past few days, hiding under the bed and shivering from The Storm. Now happy and bringing smiles to everyone in the room.

“Sorry everyone, had to make a phone call to a nervous relative,” the President says, making his way to the Resolute Desk. He gestures for Eco to lay on his dog bed at the side of the desk.

“Let me guess. Your cousin in Maine?” a staff member asks, giving a little wave to Eco.

“You are correct. She texted me concerned and I just wanted to reassure her "" he takes a sip of his coffee before continuing ""Shall we get down to business? What do we have so far?”

The members in the room set up the few proposals they have in front of him, some boards with maps and numbers on them. Once they were finished, Admiral James Huber stepped forward to start explaining the first proposal.

“Well sir, the first option is a simple one. We have a small convoy of ships leave Norfolk, cruise down to Lannisport, make contact with whoever is in charge, and start to set up diplomatic talks. Simple trade, to start a relationship. And maybe figure out a way to set up a FOB for a research team. On this satellite image here.” The Admiral points on the board.

Pointing to another location, “We believe this is the heart of the area. Casterly Rock. From the satellite image, it looks as though the entire castle is built into the mountain. And with the estimated it being Twenty-one hundred feet high. Almost as tall as the “Merdeka 118” in Malaysia, Standing at 2,227 feet. With this in mind, it would be best to make sure the convoy reaches the outskirts of Lannisport just as the sun begins to rise. They will most likely have guards watching the sea for ships coming in. We want them to have ample time to report to the High Lord. If they don’t see us first up at Casterly Rock.”

Seth, sipping his coffee and taking this option into account. It's straightforward, simple, and easy to explain. The low point of failure on our part. And if it goes well, start a friendship with the most powerful area of the continent. But, just in case he still wants to hear out the other two options.

Another General takes the lead “The other two choices are the same, but in different areas. Option one is straightforward, the convoy goes down and around what we presume to be “The Summer Sea” and up through “The Step Stones” into “The Narrow Sea” then heads straight for King’s Landing through “Blackwater Bay”. Very straightforward, but with some problems. One. The convoy will be out in the open for everyone to see. Rumors will spread along the continent, starting from what we presume to be Dorne up.”

“Most Likely the areas we travel the lords will get nervous and launch their ships to investigate, and it could get ugly. Two, if let's say nothing like that happens the other problem is just showing up at their capital unannounced and saying we know nothing about their land, and the fact that North America is on the other side and we just show up out of the blue is going to raise concern. Might scare the high lords into thinking we are here to invade, or they might just lock us out. We can’t take that chance.”

He continues with the last board, “Now option two, we go up north to a secluded, unpopulated or low population area. Meet with the locals, set up a Forward Operating Base, gather intel about the area, and go from there. The problem with this option is that you could technically call it an invasion. Which is something we want to avoid being accused of.”

Thinking about the information given, Seth realizes something. Taking another sip of his coffee, “They want to go with option one, makes sense. Important port city. Large enough for boats, well at least one by our standards. An Important family occupies the area. The map has 3 roads leaving Lannisport, so commerce will move “quickly” by Westeros standards. More importantly, they are crucial to the books. Get on their good side so we might be able to steer things, and if we don't like where it is going. We simply “topple the lion’s throne”.”

Putting his coffee down on his desk, Eco gets up and makes a little whimper to him. Looking up with some puppy eyes. Smiling, Seth opens and reaches into a drawer and pulls out a large dog treat. Eco sits and waits. Seth gives him the treat and pats his head, Eco walks back to the bed and lays down, munching on the treat.

Looking back at the men and women in the room. “I like the first option, going to Lannisport is the best course of action. Straight forward, no bullshit. But there's one thing I am concerned about. The High Lord of this area will most likely be a Lannister. The problem is which one.”

“We will be able to handle anything that happens,” the Admiral says, Highly confident. Unsurprisingly, this expedition will probably summon the Admiral into the history books.

Changing the subject to the voyage itself, “How long would it take them to get down there?”

Opening up a manila folder, “About 2 days, maybe less depending on the weather”

Taking another sip of his coffee, “What ships would make up the small convoy?”

The Admiral looks up from the folder. “Well sir, we were thinking about having 5-7 ships in total, I have a list here of the ships we think are best.” The Admiral goes to the coffee table, picks up another stack of files, and hands them out to everyone in the room. “This is the list and information of the naval vessels in mind.”

Seth flips open the thick file and reads off each ship aloud. “The USS Abraham Lincoln, Aircraft Carrier. The USS Makin Island, Amphibious Assault Ship. The USS San Antonio, Amphibious Transport Dock. The USS Savannah, Friget. The USS Arleigh Burke, Destroyer. The USS Virginia, Submarine.”

Looking through the names one last time then looking at the admiral. “Um. Don’t you think this is a bit much? I mean, this is basically a Carrier Strike Group.”

Understanding the President's concerns, “Well Sir, since this is a Medieval Fantasy world. And reading up on the book series. The possibility of Krakens, Leviathans, and course Dragons. It would be better to be over-prepared than under.” the Admiral, hoping that answers the President's question.

Closing the file on his desk, “Alright, you make a good point. In that case, I want a vessel from Project Analog added as well.”

“Sir?” The General to the side looks from the Admiral, then to the President.

“Is there a problem?” Asking both the General and Admiral.

“No Sir, there's no problem. Just, why?” The Admiral questions as politely as possible.

“I figured if we spend all that money on those old ships we might as well use one. Which ones have been fully refitted?”

The Secretary of State chimes in, “I have that file here Sir”. Grabbing said file and making his way to the Desk. Opening the file to read off the list, “Of the 43 Navy Vessels originally selected in November 2023, the ones that were completed just before The Storm are; USS Texas, USS Wisconsin, USS Missouri, USS Lexington, USS Gettysburg, USS Oak Hill, and the USS Whidbey Island”

Seth ponders the options and takes another sip of his coffee. “Let’s go with the USS Missouri, if I remember correctly she was the first one completed right?”

“Yes sir, she is in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard as we speak.”

“Good, I want her to be part of that convoy.” Now that is done, Seths looks over to the Secretary of State “What about the ambassador to meet them? Any suggestions Peter?”

Peter, giving a little chuckle “Actually Sir, I know just who. I highly suggest Kelly O’Conner. With her work with the peace between Russia and Ukraine, I think she would be perfect. Plus she loves the books”

“That’s good to hear. Call her up and give her the offer” the President says standing up. Seth raises his voice a little for everyone to listen to what he has to say. “The First Contact Convoy leaves Friday, next week on Halloween.”

2 Hours later, 11:30 A.M

*Ring, Ring*

**Other line**: Hello?

**Peter Lynch**: Kelly O’Conner? It’s Peter. Peter Lynch

**Kelly**: Oh Hey Peter! How are you? Busy?

**Peter**: Yes, it’s been very busy here at the moment. Look, I was wondering if I could ask you something. Got a minute? It’s business.

**Kelly**: Uh. Yeah sure, hold on. (Hey Honey! Could you watch Sammy for a moment!)

Male background voice: (Sure! Who is it?)

Kelly whispering: (It is Peter Lynch, the Secretary of State)

Male voice: (I thought they were not gonna call you again? I thought Ukraine was your last one?)

Kelly: (Shhhh. I know. I know. It will only be a second)

There's a moment of silence before she comes back to the phone.

**Kelly**: What can I do for you, Peter?

**Peter**: I presume you’ve watched the news?

**Kelly**: Of course.

**Peter**: So you can imagine that we will need an Ambassador.

**Kelly**: Ok. And?

**Peter**: Well. We would like the Ambassador to be you. The President is up for it. I already brought it up with him earlier.

**Kelly**: …

**Peter**: …

**Peter**: Well? What do you think? Think you’re up for it?

**Kelly**: What do I think? You want me to go to a fantasy continent and open up talks and a relationship with said continent. Meet the people there. And possibly break every worldview of said people with just our mere presence. And for what? Trade? Information? An alliance? Land? Food? Gold? Oil?

**Peter**: Pretty much. Yeah.

**Kelly**: …

**Kelly**: Give me a sec. Let me call you right back.

The audio of the phone being hung up comes through. Leaving Peter in his office alone to sit in silence

An hour goes by before the phone rings again. 12:30 pm

**Peter**: Hello?

**Kelly**: Peter? I have an answer. I just need one thing from you. Can you promise me that I will get home safely? I won't leave my girls to live without their mother.

**Peter**: You will be guarded by the bes-

**Kelly**: I need you to promise.

**Peter**: We will move heaven and earth to bring you home safely. If anything bad seems to happen, we will get you home. I promise.

**Kelly**: Alright. Send me the details. Bye.

**Peter**: We will. Bye.

Just emerged from a week-long building frenzy (fueled by way too much coffee) to launch something I think you'll find interesting. As a solo founder juggling multiple projects, my inbox was becoming a nightmare - 3 different email accounts, endless context switching, important stuff getting buried... you know the drill.

So I built Wavelength Mail ( [https://mywavelength.email](https://mywavelength.email) ) - an email client that actually understands how we work as founders. After a week of barely sleeping and coding till my fingers hurt, just shipped the private beta.

What it does (because we all hate fluffy product descriptions):

* AI assistant that gives you a founder's daily brief (newest bug reports, urgent customer emails, team updates all summarized)
* Automatically bundles emails by project/customer (no more searching through 5 threads about the same feature request)
* Smart calendar that learned my weird founder schedule (like how I need deep work time in the morning)
* Converts customer emails into tasks (because my brain can't keep track anymore)

The real reason I built this: I was spending 4+ hours daily just managing communication between customers, potential investors, and project updates. Now down to about 1.5 hours. That's extra time I can actually spend building.

Currently testing with a small group of other SaaS founders (want to make sure it works perfectly before scaling). Early users are reporting similar time savings - roughly 2.5 hours saved per day.

I know we're all skeptical of ""AI-powered"" stuff (I am too), but this is actually working. Had one founder message me yesterday saying it caught an urgent customer issue he would've missed in his usual email chaos.

If you're a founder drowning in emails and want to try it out, I'm keeping a separate waitlist for r/SaaS folks (you all know the pain points best).

1i01huc,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1i01huc/please_critique_my_credit_card_strategy_tq/,Please critique my credit card strategy tq,"Hi alll recently decided to re look into our credit cards. Please kindly feedback. Been reading miles sites to death to strategise our spendings for miles in the future. 

Fam of 4 - 2 adults 2 young kids. Feeding 2 more mouths; mother and helper. We do a mixture of both online and offline spendings. Rarely eat out, almost never in a month unless in JB. Helper preps ALL our meals - lunch + dinner. Husband’s office lunch usually at coffee shop or helper will pack for him. Groceries mostly shing sheong, fairprice, once in a while cs, and a fair bit from JB as we will stock up. JB, will make trips in about 1x/2x a month - hair cuts, facial packages, stock up snacks and random small stuff. We only do public transports and rarely do cabs unless very necessary. Can say only do cabs max 3x a month. 

Husband and myself will share cards; principle and supplementary as we live rather frugally and our solo spendings are not massive therefore better together for points pooling. Also prefer to try and stick to a bank that allows different cards pooling. Our biggest spending stuff - tuition + sch fees: 1.4K total but no miles/cashback given so no point paying thro any cards. 

We usually do 3 years of south east asian holidays once a year and then 4th year somewhere further like Aust or Japan etc therefore the miles planning now. 

Heres a break down of my credit card plans: 

1. Uob lady’s transport - average 250 + house utilities 350 - 400 (total for uob one bonus interest)

2. Uob ppv - ALL grocerries + random buys - Pay thro kris+ whenever possible, shoppee 

3. Citi rewards and amaze - m1 (280), simba (28), streaming; netflix, spotify, all malaysia spendings, favepay, shopback etc. 

4. Uob privi - for simply go pathetic miles but I guess better than nothing when lady’s category change to travel 

5. Trust card - if burst malaysia spendings on citi rewards x amaze 

What I still face is when we purchase flights that are above the 1K cap for lady’s travel. Another option is DBS woman’s world but this would mean another bank, another card, and then restructuring entire card plan which I tried re-strategising but still not sure how to fit the card into our above lifestyle or card plan. UOB Krisflyer  - need to spent 800 on kris shop - I guess this means trying our best to stick to scoot flights only? Not sure if its the most ideal as what if we want to do a Jetstar promo? Therefore settled for UOB privi it is BUT only for the flexi of agoda + simply go. I will not use UOB Expedia unless got good deal etc. so back to.. the 1K cap issue. 

*Neither our salaries are eligible for solitare card otherwise would have saved me a lot of hassle from having so many freaking cards.

*son uses concession pass; anyway to slot this in for miles? 🙃

1i01dt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Confundirdome/comments/1i01dt0/hillbillies_the_arts/,Hillbillies & The Arts,"The Fall of Art in West Virginia by KR Halley & Cleo Lumina

The Appalachian hills cradle an ancient land rich with beauty, resilience, and cultural memory. West Virginia, “Almost Heaven,” was once the seat of stories sung in harmony with the creeks and hollers, where art, poetry, and philosophy sprouted naturally from the deep loam of life. But in 2025, I fear we stand on the precipice of its final destruction. And it is no accident.

West Virginians have been conditioned—generation after generation—to shun art, poetry, and philosophy as impractical indulgences. The architects of this conditioning are not the people themselves but the wealthy and powerful, whose interests lie in a subjugated workforce, minds as barren as a mountaintop post-removal. The destruction of cultural imagination has been as calculated as the blasting of the land itself.

The wealthy industrialists who came to Appalachia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries recognized the power of beauty and thought. They knew that if the miners and their families cultivated art, embraced poetry, or discussed philosophy, they would dream beyond the mines. Art breeds awareness. Poetry sparks revolution. Philosophy demands justice. These things are the enemies of those who would profit from toil and suffering.

So, they set about a diabolical plot: to starve the region’s cultural appetite while feeding it the hollow calories of labor and consumerism. Schools were underfunded, the arts dismissed as frivolous distractions. Poetry books gathered dust in forgotten corners of understocked libraries. Music programs were cut, and philosophical discussions relegated to the ivory towers of academia—far from the coal camps and company towns where they were needed most.

Meanwhile, the coal barons wielded control with scrip—money that could only be spent at company stores, locking families into cycles of poverty. They mined not only the land but the people’s spirits, ensuring that education emphasized compliance over curiosity. Generations were raised to believe that a life of backbreaking labor was noble while questioning authority was treasonous.

Art’s decline was part of the plan. Creativity is dangerous to oppressors; it inspires dissent and fosters unity. If a miner wrote a poem about his lost brother, or a mother painted a landscape of the valley she loved, those acts of creation might have sparked conversations that threatened the barons’ power. If children learned to question, to imagine a better world, they might have demanded it. So art, poetry, and philosophy were systematically stripped from Appalachian life, replaced with endless shifts and whispered prayers for better days.

Today, the echoes of this conditioning remain. Many West Virginians still view creative pursuits with suspicion, as though they’re luxuries for elites rather than the birthright of all humanity. This is the lingering shadow of the coal barons’ plot, and it persists because the powerful continue to benefit. The extractive industries have not left—they’ve only evolved, rebranding themselves with greenwashing campaigns while continuing to strip the region of its resources and dignity.

As an artist who has fought to keep the spirit of West Virginia alive, I cannot remain silent. The 21st century has brought new tools to the struggle—AI, digital art, and global connectivity—but these too are viewed with skepticism by those conditioned to fear change.

1i01dqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1i01dqo/weird_experience_with_a_friend_today/,Weird experience with a friend today ,"I have a friend that I met through bumble like 5 years ago. We hang out a couple times a year, nothing too crazy. Back in October, I had a get together at my house for my birthday but I specifically asked this friend what weekend she would be available to come as we hadn’t seen each other in a while and I wanted to make sure she was able to make it. She gave me a weekend and I made the party that weekend, basically for her. Technically it wasn’t even my birthday month when we had it lol. A couple of days before the party, she texts me saying she can’t come because she has a funeral to attend. I felt it was a little weird to have a funeral in the evening and that it came up a couple of days before my party. I fought back the feeling that she was lying to commit to other plans (I have had a lot of experience with people doing this) and chose to believe her and wished her well. Technically, this doesn’t have anything to do with the story but trying to give a little background here. She states she’s sorry she can’t make it and that to make up for it, she’s going to take me out to lunch. 

Flash forward to us finally meeting for lunch (today) and we meet at a coffee shop/cafe. I arrive before her and save a table and review the menu. When she arrives we get in line but I leave my jacket and my purse at the table because I didn’t need it since she was paying. Or so I thought. I’m in front of her in line and I give the cashier my order and when finished, I gesture to her to “go ahead” and give her order since we are going to be on the same bill lol she thinks I am trying to pay for her meal and says “oh no, it’s okay, I’ll pay for my own”. I didn’t quite hear her so I say “what?” And she says again “no it’s okay I’m gonna pay for myself”. I suddenly realize what’s happening and I look at the cashier and he’s like 👁️👁️ lol I have to run back to the table to grab my purse. At this point I am SOOOO embarrassed. Theres a full ass line behind us, cashier is probably confused as fuck and I'm also thinking ""wtf does it mean to take someone to lunch if you’re not paying for it?"". I drove myself, I even drove 40 min to meet her halfway to her house! lol! So, I take out my card and whilst I'm fumbling to pay, she goes ""oh gosh, I…I..oh gosh"". I realize that she has realized she told me she would pay but still allowed me to pay. She actually had plenty of time to stop me. So, I embarrassingly pay for my meal and head to the table. She finishes up and then apologizes when we get to the table. I told her don't worry about it but like I was kind of peeved! Am i being a brat? lol 


Edit: she brought me a gift (I wasn’t expecting and honestly wish I would stop receiving gifts at my age) so idk if she thought maybe that was it and she didn’t need to pay for the meal? It’s weird idk ",1,1736727891.0,AskWomenOver30,12,1.0,False

The Appalachian hills cradle an ancient land rich with beauty, resilience, and cultural memory. West Virginia, “Almost Heaven,” was once the seat of stories sung in harmony with the creeks and hollers, where art, poetry, and philosophy sprouted naturally from the deep loam of life. But in 2025, I fear we stand on the precipice of its final destruction. And it is no accident.

West Virginians have been conditioned—generation after generation—to shun art, poetry, and philosophy as impractical indulgences. The architects of this conditioning are not the people themselves but the wealthy and powerful, whose interests lie in a subjugated workforce, minds as barren as a mountaintop post-removal. The destruction of cultural imagination has been as calculated as the blasting of the land itself.

The wealthy industrialists who came to Appalachia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries recognized the power of beauty and thought. They knew that if the miners and their families cultivated art, embraced poetry, or discussed philosophy, they would dream beyond the mines. Art breeds awareness. Poetry sparks revolution. Philosophy demands justice. These things are the enemies of those who would profit from toil and suffering.

So, they set about a diabolical plot: to starve the region’s cultural appetite while feeding it the hollow calories of labor and consumerism. Schools were underfunded, the arts dismissed as frivolous distractions. Poetry books gathered dust in forgotten corners of understocked libraries. Music programs were cut, and philosophical discussions relegated to the ivory towers of academia—far from the coal camps and company towns where they were needed most.

Meanwhile, the coal barons wielded control with scrip—money that could only be spent at company stores, locking families into cycles of poverty. They mined not only the land but the people’s spirits, ensuring that education emphasized compliance over curiosity. Generations were raised to believe that a life of backbreaking labor was noble while questioning authority was treasonous.

Art’s decline was part of the plan. Creativity is dangerous to oppressors; it inspires dissent and fosters unity. If a miner wrote a poem about his lost brother, or a mother painted a landscape of the valley she loved, those acts of creation might have sparked conversations that threatened the barons’ power. If children learned to question, to imagine a better world, they might have demanded it. So art, poetry, and philosophy were systematically stripped from Appalachian life, replaced with endless shifts and whispered prayers for better days.

Today, the echoes of this conditioning remain. Many West Virginians still view creative pursuits with suspicion, as though they’re luxuries for elites rather than the birthright of all humanity. This is the lingering shadow of the coal barons’ plot, and it persists because the powerful continue to benefit. The extractive industries have not left—they’ve only evolved, rebranding themselves with greenwashing campaigns while continuing to strip the region of its resources and dignity.

As an artist who has fought to keep the spirit of West Virginia alive, I cannot remain silent. The 21st century has brought new tools to the struggle—AI, digital art, and global connectivity—but these too are viewed with skepticism by those conditioned to fear change. The same forces that demonized the arts now sow distrust of technology, ensuring the region remains isolated, its people dependent on industries that exploit them.

Starting medication has been a challenge for me, so I sought out alternative solutions while I work on figuring it out. For the past week I've been operating in mostly the same routine, and the improvement is crazy, so I thought I'd share it with you all and hopefully it can help you as well! 

1. High protein breakfast! Will give you more energy throughout the day. It helps a lot if you have meals prepped or leftovers of some kind, since waking up is my Achilles heel at the moment. I started focusing on protein in the mornings because of my meds, but even without them it's a big help, especially with the second tip:

2. Coffee or caffeine of some kind! Caffeine (while it tends to be less effective than medication) is a stimulant and helps me a lot in short periods of time, even if I don't have a whole lot of it. I've been taking it about every 3 or so hours/when I start to feel my symptoms show up/with every meal. Make sure you eat when you take it because it tends to be less effective otherwise.

3: yoga and exercise 

I'll be honest, I HATE exercising. Despite this I've still been moving my body just enough to get rid of that sluggish feeling I get every day. Just 5 minutes of yoga in the morning makes a huge difference. It's also recommended to break up the day with more exercise. The best part is that it doesn't have to be anything crazy or time consuming. A little bit goes a long way. I'll usually stretch and do a few push-ups around every meal.

4: vitamins and supplements

This is definitely worth talking to your doctor about, but keeping up with your daily intake of essential vitamins is... Well... Essential. The specifics are something I'm still in the process of figuring out, but multivitamins are definitely a good place to start. I can specifically tell the difference the most with vitamin D, but I'd recommend looking into it more yourself!",1,1736727460.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

I'm 19 and currently in my last semester of community college and will soon be transferring to a 4-year university to pursue a Bachelor's in Management Information Systems (MIS). Over the 2 years, I've completed 3 IT internships and just got offered a 4th, which I found both enjoyable and more valuable than typical part-time jobs (e.g., my previous role at Wawa in high school).



My ultimate goal is to work in cybersecurity, but I'm struggling to land a cybersecurity internship. I've sent out over 100 applications in the past two months without any luck. (rejection emails are my morning coffee at this point lol)



Here's why I'm asking about the CompTIA A+: my current internship sponsors it completely and offers up to 3 attempts for the certification (1 try each part with a just incase extra try). My boss, who has been in IT for a long time, strongly recommends I start with A+, then move on to Network+ and Security+ completing the trifecta. However, I’m getting mixed feedback from others as ive been a long time lurker in here. Some suggest that with 4 IT internships under my belt, studying for the A+ might be a waste of time and that I should focus on either the Google Cybersecurity Certificate since my current semester is pretty full with me taking 18 credits and an internship or jump straight into Security+.



I can’t shake the feeling that being in community college has limited my chances of getting a cybersecurity internship which sucks, and now I feel stuck and unsure of what to do next.



Would pursuing the CompTIA A+ still be worth it in my situation? Or should I look into other certifications like Security+ or the Google Cybersecurity Certificate instead? Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated, ill be actively responding and feel free to pm me!

My partner (38m) and I have been trying to reconcile over the past two weeks after a breakup (one of many unfortunately.) Our history has been rocky, and my trust in him is low for several reasons:

1. In the past, he has admitted to cheating on previous partners.
2. While we were together, I found him liking thirst traps of his exes and women he’s previously hooked up with, as well as being flirty and touchy/feely with other women (he chalks flirting up to being part of his latino culture, and also that he has to get lots of coffees and happy hours with women because of his job)
3. He follows and engages with a lot of “baddie” women (both local to us and influencer types) on social media, liking their bikini photos, thirst traps, and stories. I admit I know this because after I saw him engaging with his ex I looked at his other followers.
4. After a breakup in the fall he immediately got on tinder and when we reconciled he never deactivated it until a friend of mine saw him on there.
4. After our last breakup, he slept with a bartender I could tell he was into while we were together.

We’re currently working on rebuilding things, but I’m struggling with two recent situations:

1. He refuses to add me back on Instagram, saying it’s because he doesn’t want me “surveilling him.” He claims I’ll just get jealous and upset. He says we need to build trust first before he wants to reconnect on socials.
2. Last night, he told me he was going to his friend’s new nightclub opening for an hour, but he stayed until 3 a.m. I later saw stories from the event where he was talking really closely with a couple of women. (Yes, I was watching social media for this stuff 😭)

I feel so insecure, and I hate feeling this way. But at the same time, I think his behavior is contributing to my lack of trust. He says I’m insecure and that I need to own my own feelings because he’s not doing anything wrong, and that I don’t understand his culture. I don’t know if he’s right that I’m being unreasonable or if my concerns are valid.

My question is that why doesn’t Singapore have more homegrown products that can stand up to and overtake big intentional brands like in Indonesia or Malaysia- apart from F&N or Tiger Beer. 

Especially when Singapore is a regional “R&D” hub that usually is the first to attract big global brands, why isn’t this experience or knowledge tricking down to Singaporeans? Is start up costs are high? Preference for more “atas” American/ European/ Japanese/ Korean/ China brands?

I would like to install Kali Linux and Ubuntu as a dual boot with respective hard disk encryption on my Lenovo ThinkPadt480, but somehow it doesn't work. 

My previous procedure:
I have a 1 TB hard disk, I first made it empty with GParted and then created 4 partitions on it: one 1 GB for boot, esp; one 16 GB for swap and the rest of the hard disk I partitioned equally for Ubuntu (/dev/nvme0n1p4) and Kali (/dev/nvme0n1p2).

I then started Ubuntu live and encrypted nvme0n1p4 and the swap partitioning with Luks. I then decrypted nvme0n1p4 again and installed Ubuntu on it manually. When Ubuntu was installed, I rebooted the laptop, but I didn't have to enter the password for the encryption when I booted up, and I didn't have to enter it when I turned it off and on again.
So I wanted to ask if someone could explain to me how to do it correctly and how I can then install Kali with encryption.

1i011qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1i011qq/the_fake_service_dogs_are_out_of_control_in_slc/,The Fake Service Dogs are out of control in SLC,"Had to kick a fake service dog in the face today. 

While on a walk today and a stop in a coffee shop near downtown I was bit by a dog in an Amazon purchased “Service dog” vest. I reacted by kicking it as hard as I physically could in the face. Would not be surprised if the dog was injured but the owner literally ran away. 

I'm gonna throw this up here for any employees/store owners. I've had a German Shepherd trained as my diabetic alert dog for over 7 years.

First and foremost, in the State of Utah the protections offered to service dogs also extends to service dogs in training. However this does not excuse behaviors that are REQUIRED of service animals.

First, if a service animal is not controlled or If the animal is relieving itself in inappropriate places; it's no longer protected under the ADA. You as a business owner/employee can ask them to leave. 

Emotional support animals do not have the same public access allowances as trained service animals which have been trained to allleviate a disability; making someone ""feel better"" is not sufficient to qualify a dog as a service animal.

If you run into a situation where the status of a dog is in doubt you can ask two questions. 1. Is that a service animal and 2. What task/function has it been trained to perform. If the handler cannot answer both questions; they're not a service animal and have no legal protection under the ADA.

Utah has a notorious reputation in the service dog and handler community for uncontrolled dogs in public shops and common areas where it's plainly not appropriate to have your dog out and going as far as faking service dogs. Leave fido at home and invest in crate training if needed.

1i0113u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i0113u/my_best_friends_wedding/,My best friends wedding,"TW: self harm mentioned & transphobia

I met my friend who become my best friend in highschool. We will call her Carol.
We met day one and become so close. I was always invited each Friday for dinner and then her, her sister's, who I was also friend with me & I went swimming with our other close mates. Everyone in her family used to say I was one of the family. I honestly always felt loved and cared for in that house as a teen. My family home wasn't a nice place.

We continued to have days out together after we each finished with school and moving on to a different stage in life. We lost touch when I become homeless. I was extremely depressed and was actively self harming.
I sofa surfed for a few months before a room in a homeless hostel opened up. I had my own room that I could lock with a little basic kitchen, a bed and wash room. It was lovely. I'm trans and my parents did not like it. I received from my parents a number of calls and messages telling me I was a sinful freak, I needed to be fixed (prayed over in church) and all that. I was in a dark place. 

I won't get into what happened with my family but I will say it ended with me having to work with the police in order to get them to leave me alone. 

Anyway, before disconnecting from my family and after leaving the homeless hostel and returning to my parents house....my parents made me feel like I was a terrible person and I needed to get right with God & I needed to be fixed. It was a hard time in my life. I am free now and live happily away from them as my true self.

After returning to my parents house & dealing with them trying to fix me I a few months after got my own flat. I ran into Carol in the town which I now lived in. We caught up and started hanging out again. 

I came out to her as trans and she seemed fine with it. I wasn't at the time living openly due to family. 

A few months later she broke up with her long term boyfriend - around 8 years together and soon after meet an older guy. They where dating for about 2 months and she tells me be says he's going to marry her soon, he said he was. I was stocked but supported her.

He proposed a few weeks later. Carol's younger sister was engaged and I at the time and still do believe she was wanting to get married before her little sister. 

She moved in with her guy, well call him Matt a few weeks after that and began the wedding plans. She said I was a part of her bridal party. All I asked was that she didn't put me in a dress, she said that was fine and that she wanted me to be comfortable at her wedding.

I was invited to her house warming party. It was nice, apart from her mum getting drunk & snapping at Carol's step dad. I don't think they are together anymore.

During the night I happened to turn around and saw Matt staring daggers at me. He honestly looked so angry and like he was gonna snap. But just as quickly Matt went back into laughing & carrying on in the party. 

I went home & Carol said she would be in touch for the wedding stuff. A few weeks later after not hearing from her I was invited into town to get a coffee with my mother. I just thought Carol was busy with family life and living with her fiance and work.

It was then that my mother said ""I don't know how to tell you this but she got married"" she passed me her phone. I was faced with a FB post from another friend saying how great the wedding was & thanking her for inviting him. I was shocked. 

I reached out to Carol and she said the reason I was not invited and was ghosted was because I walked past her in a shop and didn't say hello. That is bullshit. I hadn't been out much and not in shops over that time. I wasn't well and was ordering home shopping delivery. I at the time only went out to put out & collect the bins. 

We haven't talked in years now. It hurts a little even now when I think about it. My mother always said I had no friends and in that moment I believed her.


EDIT: I know it isn't set during a wedding but it is wedding related. Hope it's ok ❤️",2,1736726884.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

We’ve been texting all day, and every night we text or call for 3-4 hours, so we know each pretty well at this point. I’ve started to develop feelings and really like him. 

He keeps saying he wants to see me. We agreed to a coffee date. The drive is 1 and a half hours

First time he cancelled: the weather was really bad 

Second time: he was hanging out with friends and was too tired 

Third time: he said he wants to go gym, and would come too late, so there wasn’t enough time

On the phone I asked why he keeps putting it off (and never had good reasons for cancelling) and he admitted that it’s too soon to meet for a first date and that he’s a slow burner. He wanted to carry on texting for another couple of weeks before meeting up. 

I was only asking to meet for coffee, so nothing crazy. At this point I felt pretty shit, like I was twisting his arm to meet me. I also had started to catch feelings, so we definitely were connected over the phone. 

So I just told him politely that I didn’t like the lack of enthusiasm and that he should be happy to meet me face to face, and it shouldn’t feel like I was forcing him. I told him we should just stop talking. 

Now I’m feeling really down. I know on paper I did the right thing because I shouldn’t be begging someone for a coffee date, but I really like him, and am wondering if I’m maybe over reacting, and it’s too soon for a first date.

2024. It felt like I was never going to get my positive but since the start I felt good about this cycle.
We had trips coming up so that kind of distracted me.
The NEW things I added this cycle was:
-Eu Natural vitamins ""Conception for her & him""
-Frida IUl at home kit
-1 glass of red wine from CD 1 until ovulation started.
-Wild Yam cream from Human Roots on Amazon. Starting it twice daily from 3 dpo.
-On an empty stomach I would take vitamin C drops with Beekeepers Immune support spray.
-After breakfast I would have all my vitamins, and then have my coffee (Black, I added collagen to it & ceylon cinnamon).
-TWW: I stopped working out. I wore fuzzy socks every day.
Whenever I sat I put on a blanket and then a heating pad on top of it. To keep uterus warm and would rotate between uterus and feet! (Always with a blanket underneath so l wouldn't burn myself)
What I continued doing:
-Seed cycling. +3 brazil nuts daily
-Beet juice powder + LMNT electrolytes + coconut water every day.
-Walks
-CoQ10 400mg
-Omega 3

A few years ago, I got my feet sized with one of those digital foot scanners.  Per that scan, my left foot is just shy of a nine while my right is just shy of an 8. I used Nick's sizing guide to compare, and my left is a Nick's 8.5 while the right is closer to an 8.  These sizes, compared to the foot scans are about a 1/2 size smaller. This matches the recommendation of choosing a half size smaller. All that said, it sounds like an 8.5 is my best choice. My width is EE. 

I'm looking at picking up a pair of Falcons. I manage a coffee shop during the day, and am a professional musician at night. Aside from my career, I work on my car and take on the occasional home renovation project. I am usually on my feet for a pretty good chunk of the day, but I'm don't do anything else too demanding that would require heavier duty boot hardware. I definitely prefer the more casual styling of these boots. 

I'm torn between two outsole choices. I'm leaning towards the V-bar, but I see that the 430 mini is slip resistant while the V-bar isn't.  I'm curious about this because of the snow and ice during winter.  I live in the midwest, so snow usually isn't too big of an issue, but do the 430 minis have noticeably more grip and traction, or is the difference between the two outsoles negligible? 

One last thing, I like the look of thr Dublin English Tan, but I haven't seen too many pictures of this leather. Does anyone have any pictures of the leather?

1i00vq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i00vq5/confused_please_weigh_in/,Confused. Please weigh in! ,"So my partner broke up with me. She’s in 12-step recovery (me too), works full-time (as do I), has obligations to family. We’ve known each other since March and started dating in September. I didn’t cry and I didn’t get angry. She was visibly upset but I don’t totally buy any of it at this point. 

I had not been in a relationship for five years. Took that time to work on myself, heal, get a good-paying job. We saw each twice, sometimes once a week because we work different schedules. I have a master’s degree and work in finance with a nice salary and she has an AA and is a waitress. This never bothered me in the slightest! She was well read and having worked in restaurants past, I know it’s really hard work. 

Anyway, she told me that: she doesn’t feel like she can prioritize her family, friends, self and 12-step and doesn’t feel like she’s been as supportive of me as she could. AA is part of my life, but it is not my whole identity. I don’t advertise to others I’m sober; she is very very open about it. That works for some people, but I want to be defined by my whole life accomplishments. Lately she’s been trying to work with more new women who keep relapsing and are highly manipulative people. She had blown me off to go do that in the past. I didn’t interfere. 

She was crying about how much she loved me and I’m the best partner she’s had and she is falling in love with me. BUT when her friends say stuff like “I wish we hung out more” she feels as though she has let them down and is neglecting them. Last night she sobbed through our scheduled date time, ultimately leaving, because she felt so overwhelmed dedicating time to family, friends, service and me. I was totally caught off guard. I’ve personally never felt that overwhelmed by my commitments to other people to where it prevents me from having romantic partnerships. Over time, and we just hit four months, the partner earns a top spot in my life. It’s easy and effortless for me. My friends don’t guilt trip me and when they say stuff like “I miss you” I say “miss you too, let’s get coffee sometime” and then we do. 


I feel as though having a hoard of BFFs is something I’ve left in high school. Many people I love dearly I haven’t seen in years, our lives just took off and I don’t take it personally. She said I deserve a better partner who can prioritize me more, and part of me agrees, but to be honest, I also feel so used by this person and deceived and angry. We had just gotten to “I see a future together.” I just posted her on socials. I just told my friends about her. My mother was diagnosed with early treatable cancer in early December. I had a horrible childhood and have done immense amounts of work to get to where I am. She still talks to two loser exes, makes time for druggie friends, family, and wants to be savior to still drunk alcoholics, but I couldn’t make the cut. 

She’s hiking a trail for three months this year and I was okay with that absence and with seeing each other twice/once a week. I don’t believe this was a big ask. I don’t believe it’s too much to accommodate. 

My recovery friend warned me some sober drunks just love drama and she could be pursuing that with me. I am not one of them. My life has been serene in the year plus I’ve been sober. I have no temptation to drink. I don’t smoke weed. I changed my life in major ways. 

LASTLY this was her first relationship with a woman. I’m a lesbian and she’s bi. I’m secure in who I am. I also don’t advertise that, there’s no need. I don’t fuck with corporate “LGBTQ” stuff. I’ve dated bi women before and they’ve been great partners, so I don’t exclude them from my pool. No more words on that, but I can’t help but feel that’s playing a role. Sucks to say it but being in a homo relationship can still trip people up these days. From men she seemed to chase crumbs from bums (drunks and druggies) and I showed up stable, secure, loving. I refuse to feel embarrassed by any of it but boy do I feel used. ",1,1736726460.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

Why is it that every time Mixed Reality (MR) comes up, someone has to say, ""It’s not real MR unless it maps your living room or interacts with your furniture""? Honestly, that mindset is killing creativity in the space.

MR doesn’t need to overcomplicate itself to be valid. A game where you grab a virtual steering wheel to control a car in your space, or throw a virtual bowling ball without worrying about your coffee table, is still MR. It’s about blending the virtual and real worlds in ways that are fun and engaging—not just about showing off cutting-edge tech.

Let’s be real: Most players don’t care if the game perfectly integrates with their furniture or maps every surface. What they care about is whether the game is fun, immersive, and easy to pick up. Sure, there are purists and tech enthusiasts who love pushing the boundaries of MR, and I respect that—but why should that be the only definition?

So, let’s settle this: Is MR about perfection and tech flexing, or is it about creativity and accessibility? Let’s hear your best arguments.

When the new year started, I have made a new years resolution for myself. At the start of 2025, I would start from the beginning of writing asmr scripts. While I had fun writing most of them, There are two scripts that I'm not proud of writing.

[This is the first script I'm not proud of making](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASMRScriptHaven/comments/1f1a56b/finally_taking_revenge_on_your_popular_bully_a4a/). The reason I'm not proud of it, was because, I asked a fellow writer in private messages for feedback and criticism and they stated, ""the script isn't spaced properly. they're one big block of text instead of lines in a script for people to read, it makes it harder to read and understand."" But the core reason I not proud of it, is because I think I ripped off the sources script I took inspiration from.

[Here is the second script I'm not proud of making](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASMRScriptHaven/comments/1fcyt6p/making_your_yandere_bully_pay_yandere_bully_fdom/). I'm not proud of it because I butchered the character the speaker played in the script that I took inspiration from. I'm lucking that it got one [fill ](https://youtu.be/tN9taIcRnHw)at all. The second reason is that, as pointed out by another VA that was willing to filling and a third VA that wasn't, it was way too violent.

1i00rnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i00rnd/im_so_confused_i_need_help/,"I'm so confused, I need help","Okay, a little background, A (30m) and I (23f) are not from the same continent, but we work in the same niche business and were bound to meet at some point. I met A about 2 months ago, we immediately clicked but I didn't think too much of it at the time as I was in a long term relationship at that point. We talked nonstop for about a week and I flew out to meet him before he left to go back home. When I was there I met up with a friend of ours for coffee before A joined us, A and I then spent the entire day together except for the roughly 30 - 60min he had to work. We first went out in the city to explore as none of us had been there before, and he kept taking pictures of me out in the city. We then went back to my hotel room so that he could take a nap as he was running on just a few hours of sleep since they don't get much sleep where he was staying (he tells me the next day that he had even made room in the bed for me to also take a nap, it was a tiny single bed), he even took a shower there as they don't have regular access to one. Since we were going out to join the rest of our friends I decided to change while he showered and when he got out he looked me up and down and told me ""wow you look absolutely fantastic"". On our way to our friends he held me around my lower back as we crossed every street and made sure I was okay as I had heels (boots with like a 10cm heel) on and didn't want me to trip or anything. When there he held my hand when we were walking through the crowd, even when it wasn't needed, and always checked with me to see if I was okay or if I needed anything (they're mostly his friends, I know about 4-5 ppl out if the maybe 20 ppl in the crew). It was to the point where we got asked if we were a couple. When everyone else decided to order food he wanted to go out and eat with just the two of us, I was also not allowed to pay. We then went back to everyone else just for a little bit to hang out, and for me to say goodbye to the guys I know as I won't see them for months now, he then wanted to leave to go back to my hotel to just hang out. We talked for HOURS before he had to leave and when we said goodbye he held me in the longest hug I've probably ever had and gave me kisses on my head and then right before he left we hugged one more time, just as warm and boyfriendy as the first one, and then he stood just a few centimeters from my face, just as he had done so many times throughout the day. My friend then told me he had asked A about us when he got back and that he had ""giggled like a little girl"". 
We're still talking nonstop and over new years when he was away on another work trip he sent me suggestive pictures. Though a week ago he randomly switched from sending pictures back and forth (our main source of communication is instagram as we can't really text) to just messages. Also when I broke up with my ex at the start of December A told me that I deserve so much better.
Last week I had a bit too much to drink and started to talk to him about this guy I like, which is him, but I did not tell him it was him I was talking about. He asked if it was him and I stupidly said ""no, you're in a relationship, I wouldn't do that to you""and he responded with basically ""sorry if I lead you on. But you should really bring this up with this individual"".
Do I still tell him? And if so how? He's in a relationship that doesn't seem to be very loving, acts like a boyfriend with me and our mutual friends felt the vibe between us to the point where they actually had to ask if we're a thing? Even left us alone so only we would be alone just the two of us. What do I do? I really like him, help!

My dog passed away in March which was sad but we knew for a long time it would happen so I was prepared for it. What wasn't I prepared for? COVID. The first reason why I loved lockdown was because I was getting burnt out of going to school and work straight after school. Online classes were such a huge breath of fresh air. I would wake up in the morning, have a few cups of coffee, boot up zoom, listen to the class in the background and play Call of Duty. I would do that for about 4-5 hours, do a few hours of school work and go to work in the evenings. 

Lets talk about my job. My job was classified as an essential business by the state so especially in the early parts of lockdown it was one of the only places that was open and it was super busy which for the most part I really like. Also that whole spring, summer and fall they gave out unlimited double overtime so especially when school let out my paychecks were thick af. We also had a really tight knit crew in our garden department and in lot I work at Home Depot and there was an we are all in this together feeling. Also because of the layoffs in restaurants the seasonal hires we got that spring and summer were really good and some of the ladies were super attractive and fun to work with. 

Also, 2020 was when I got into Anime. If I wasn't doing zoom classes, playing Call of Duty or working I was watching Naruto. That show came into my life at the perfect time. Lots of episodes, charming story, action especially in Shippuden and good sound track to boot. I was so enthralled with the storyline of Naruto I would often times find myself thinking about it alot at work and discussing it with my co workers. 

Now it is time for the ladies. 2020 I had a close female friend graduate High School. I was 4 years older than her and we both agreed when I graduated High School that we wouldn't talk because of the age gap. Fast forward to December 2019 when she is 17 we kind of start talking again. Fast forward to March-April 2020 during lockdown she is 18 now, all of her classes are online, most nights during and after work I am texting her and she is sending me a ton of spicy noodies of herself and with one of her bff's. She ended up sending me a ton of solo and lesbian amature content with her gf and that stuff put me on cloud 9. Often times I would be at work in the evenings and she would hit me up saying that she was with her gf and if I had any requests for when I got home. 

  
Fast forward to now covid is basically over, I am slightly older than I was then, All except for one of my co workers that I worked with during lockdown have moved on, one passed away in a car accident. I have watched all of the major anime that I loved during covid especially Naruto and One Piece, My girlfriend graduated college, has a career, is engaged, and her father passed away over the summer, her bff moved states and here I am still working the same job I had during covid, slightly different position but I basically feel like I have been standing still. I have been looking at different jobs here and there and I think i have found a few that I would like to apply to but I really miss life during covid lockdown. I feel guilty about missing it because I know it was a really shitty year for a lot of people but for me personally it was one of the best years I have ever had and I doubt I will have another year like it moving forward.

My partner (38m) and I have been trying to reconcile over the past two weeks after a breakup (one of many unfortunately.) Our history has been rocky, and my trust in him is low for several reasons:

1. In the past, he has admitted to cheating on previous partners.
2. While we were together, I found him liking thirst traps of his exes and women he’s previously hooked up with, as well as being flirty and touchy/feely with other women (he chalks flirting up to being part of his latino culture, and also that he has to get lots of coffees and happy hours with women because of his job)
3. He follows and engages with a lot of “baddie” women (both local to us and influencer types) on social media, liking their bikini photos, thirst traps, and stories. I admit I know this because after I saw him engaging with his ex I looked at his other followers.
4. After a breakup in the fall he immediately got on tinder and when we reconciled he never deactivated it until a friend of mine saw him on there.
4. After our last breakup, he slept with a bartender I could tell he was into while we were together.

We’re currently working on rebuilding things, but I’m struggling with two recent situations:

1. He refuses to add me back on Instagram, saying it’s because he doesn’t want me “surveilling him.” He claims I’ll just get jealous and upset. He says we need to build trust first before he wants to reconnect on socials.
2. Last night, he told me he was going to his friend’s new nightclub opening for an hour, but he stayed until 3 a.m. I later saw stories from the event where he was talking really closely with a couple of women. (Yes, I was watching social media for this stuff 😭)

I feel so insecure, and I hate feeling this way. But at the same time, I think his behavior is contributing to my lack of trust. He says I’m insecure and that I need to own my own feelings because he’s not doing anything wrong, and that I don’t understand his culture.

I simply told them that I will babysit but not parent them. I will watch them for short periods of time because I have a life to live. I said that if they have another baby I will be a big sister to it and not another mother or parent. 

I said that if I have another child dumped onto me I will be calling CPS immediately because I will not take this any longer. I told them that I am not a person they can just take advantage of. I then told them that although I do believe in discipline, the word of god, and helping out; I will not be parenting just because they don’t want to. I simply took a life risk and said “You made that child. I had nothing to do with what you created.”

I told her that I want a bit of freedom. I want to be able to go for a walk, go out with friends, go to libraries for study time, and go to coffee shops to read or whatever! My dad said that he would make sure this situation wouldn’t happen again. 

Also the reason why I refused to call CPS is because that’s a bit too far for this type of situation. Also I did tell some people but many of you clearly missed that. I said my dad’s stepmom had me doing the baby duties when I was at her house and we went often so it would happen often. My parents are not bad parents (as some stated) and I refuse to sit and say “I’ll kill the baby” or “I’ll harm it” because that’s down right cruel and unnecessary. Also people who said that, get some help because if that’s how your brain works…that’s not healthy. Another thing is that, my parents do not use religion as an excuse or abuse. They simply state scriptures like obeying and stuff like that.

Edit: I forgot to add their response srry! 

My dad said that he was sorry and he never should’ve gave the responsibility to me especially as a child. He then said that if I am willing to babysit he will pay a good price for me to babysit and he won’t have me babysitting everyday. My mom said that I don’t have to babysit or help out with them if I don’t want to (which ain’t the case) and she said that I am growing up into a woman and the last thing that she wants is for me to have a terrible teen life. 

Edit 2: one more thing about this whole whopping situation and I’m reporting. It’s not abuse when you do something wrong. Read the Bible. Yes ppl take it out of context but I know what god says to me. No they do not hit me with the belt for every little thing. It is a certain type of abuse that would be considered abuse…which this is not. A bunch of ppl like you are reasons why ppl don’t believe in god today. ",85,1736725057.0,AITAH,133,0.78,False

I'll spare you all the details (see I'm really not feeling like myself), but I've been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting. I think I'm coming to realize that my entire work persona is one big mask. I always felt I was being myself at work, at most just a better version of me, but doesn't everyone right.

However, the exhaustion that knocked me over the head once I called in, and how I'm struggling even _more_ with simple household chores now despite the extra time off... Pretending to be a functioning human at work must have been draining me so much more than I realized.

1i00c67,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i00c67/i_need_help/,I need help ,"
There’s this girl I hang out with. We text all day, every day. When we meet up in person, we spend 5–6 hours together and really enjoy ourselves. We’ve clicked on every level – jokes, conversations, everything. Naturally, I like her, which is why I started hanging out with her in the first place, because I find her very beautiful. But now she’s also become incredibly dear and fun to me. She enjoys spending time with me as well, constantly sending me messages, thinking of me, and telling me how funny I am, etc.

The problem, of course, is that she broke up with her boyfriend a month and a half ago. It was a four-year relationship, and she’s not yet ready for something serious, meaning she hasn’t fully healed from it yet. We’ve talked about it, and she knows my intentions. I even asked her if she’s ever had this kind of friendly relationship with another guy, and she said no. I’ve made it clear to her that I want something more with her, that I want her to be my girlfriend. She said she’s aware of that, but everything is still fresh from the breakup and that she’ll need time. She also mentioned that if it weren’t for the situation with her breakup, everything would most likely already be as I’d imagined.

In any case, she told me not to overthink it and that she’s just enjoying spending time with me right now, and over time, she should be ready for something more. Basically, I’m the most important person in her life at the moment. She’s shown me that I’m her most frequent contact on her phone, and we see each other quite often. I’ve been to her house, driven her car, etc. She simply enjoys being with me, but occasionally gives me signs that I have something to hope for. She often tells me how important I am to her and how much she values me.

Also, when we hug to say goodbye, those are long hugs, with her gentle touches, and it seems to me there’s something on her end too, but she just doesn’t want to rush because she’s not ready for it yet. I hope and truly believe that’s true, based on her communication, gestures, etc. She also told me she’s glad that I’m not forcing anything and that I’ve adjusted to her current state.

But how long should I wait? She also mentioned that she’s finally taking some time for herself after a four-year relationship and that she likes it. My plan is this: to go out with her a few more times and see if there’s any progress on her end. After two more outings, on the third time, I’ll try to find the right moment to kiss her. If I manage to kiss her and see her interest—meaning she responds and reciprocates the kiss—it means things are moving in the right direction. If I don’t succeed, meaning if she rejects me, I’ll explain the situation to her.

And the situation is this: she simply can’t be just my friend because I like her, I care about her, I find her fun, and I want something serious with her. I enjoy hanging out with her, and it’s all great, but it’s just not what I’m looking for, and I can’t keep doing this indefinitely if I don’t see her reciprocating. If she’s not ready for that, I’ll tell her that in my opinion, we need to reduce how much we hang out and text because that would make it easier for me. We can still see each other at university for coffee, in group hangouts, or on nights out, but I don’t think it would make sense to keep spending as much time together as we do now.

Then again, that was the plan, but I’m afraid of losing her. Maybe I should wait for her to make the first move, because I’m sure there is something from her side besides friendship—I can feel it with her flirting and everything. I just don’t know when it will happen.

I'm wondering if there exists a sort of morning blend similar to pre-workout, but perhaps it would have only like 125mg of caffeine, some electrolytes like magnesium and potassium, and maybe a few water soluble vitamins or similar that people usually lack or whatever else people generally might need that's safe. (Vitamin C?)

I found a preworkout lately that has magnesium and potassium, and since I don't really like coffee, on the especially hard mornings with less sleep id take a small scoop. Downsides are that it has 250mg of caffeine per scoop, so I could only do half, and it has a lot of other workout related stuff like beta alanine that makes u tingle, which id like to avoid.

TLDR: So, does anyone know about a sort of ""pre workout"" that is \*made\* for the mornings, without all of the workout stuff, just with some caffeine, electrolytes and maybe something else that might be nice to have:) (Not very educated on vitamins and such..)

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[COMING_UP]  The week ahead...** The year is already 3.5% gone. Life happens fast! Let’s take a look at what’s happening this week. 

>  **PH:** We start the week with CREIT’s Q3 dividend payment, so there will be a few extra pesos floating around the exchange. Unfortunately, that’s it for scheduled domestic news. 

>  **International:** On Thursday we get CPI data from the US for the month of December, and then on Friday we will get a jobs report. These are becoming more important now that concerns are rising that inflation is picking up again and that there may be far fewer interest rate cuts in FY25 than previously expected.
>    - ***MB:*** From a PSEi perspective, we’re at a level (~6,500) that should be fairly familiar to investors. We started 2024 at 6,550. We started 2023 at 6,586. Both those years, the PSEi would go on to slump at least 10% lower from that point (2023’s fall happened from January to September; 2024’s happened from January to May) before pushing back up to the starting position. My feeling is that we’re heading into a period of uncertainty. Whether that’s going to be the garden-variety uncertainty that grips the market from time to time, or whether it will be outright chaos, I can’t tell. Even if I ignore the political noise coming from the US and all of Trump’s marginally-insane geopolitical ramblings, I can’t ignore what’s happening in gold, the US dollar, and bond yields. The Fed’s mantra through the whole inflationary crisis was “higher for longer”, and it’s becoming clearer that the size of the celebration at the Fed’s original pivot could have been inflation’s “Mission Accomplished” moment. Inflation isn’t dead, and there are a lot of metrics coming out of the US that would actually seem to suggest that rates might need to be raised to cool off what seems like an overly-hot economy. But raising rates to suppress the cost of labor is definitely a choice, and all choices have consequences. Now fold the Trump shenanigans back into the mix and I have no idea what to think. I’ll just borrow a line from [Vitruvius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00hnGGRfyPk) the wise: “Cover your butt.”

>- **[NEWS]  Citicore Renewable Energy takes ₱6.7B investment from Indonesia...** **Citicore Renewable Energy** [CREC 3.49 ▲5.8%; 234% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=ee452dc4de746cd6ec6e1601ccee8f59)] sold a 20% interest in the company to **PT Pertamina Power Indonesia** (Pertamina NRE), a subsidiary of **Pertamina Power**, a state-owned power producer in Indonesia. Under the terms of the deal, CREC will sell ~2.23 billion primary common shares to Pertamina NRE at a price of ₱3.00/share, to raise approximately ₱6.7 billion. CREC bills this transaction as the start of a “partnership” that will give it “the opportunity to partner with Pertamina NRE to develop renewable energy projects in Indonesia, allowing for the company’s potential expansion in the region.” For Pertamina NRE, this deal is part of its parent company’s push to invest nearly $6 billion in renewable energy over the next four years.
>    - ***MB:*** This deal is at a 9% discount to CREC’s pre-announcement market price, but the post-announcement surge in buying interest says (for now) that buyers aren’t too concerned. This is the kind of deal that can drive long-term growth, but it’s not an automatic win. Nothing about this deal, from what we know publicly, guarantees CREC access to the Indonesian market or to participate in any of Pertamina NRE’s projects. The tone of the press release certainly paints a collaborative picture, but ₱6B business deals are not made between friends, they’re made between “interests”. Shareholders should probably be cautiously optimistic about this, but temper that optimism with every month that passes where we don’t hear news about a new project with direct lineage to this deal. At the very least, this is a huge fundraise for CREC. Since these are primary shares, the money will go directly to CREC for use in whatever CREC’s management team sees fit.

>- **[UPDATE]  PNB “exploring alternative approaches” to facilitate listing of property dividend corporation...** **Philippine National Bank** [PNB 29.90 ▼0.7%; 28% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=3fd920c0247ea4daec6e1601ccee8f59)] responded to the exchange's query about its outstanding property dividend that it declared in early 2021. To refresh, PNB declared a property dividend of 0.156886919 shares of **PNB Holdings Corporation** (PHC) for every 1 share of PNB owned. All shareholders of record as of May 18, 2021, were entitled to receive this property dividend, but it took forever for PNB to set a distribution date, which it eventually did, for October 25, 2024. However, that date was only applicable to shareholders who receive an eCAR from the BIR and who had fully settled their withholding tax obligation. In October, PNB said that it had obtained 902 eCARs out of the 36,362 eCARs required for all shareholders entitled to the property dividend, but that only 224 of those shareholders with eCARs had fully paid their taxes and were eligible to actually receive the property dividend. According to this update--three months later--PNB is saying that an additional 313 eCARs have been issued (total of 1,215 of out 36,362), and that an additional 44 shareholders had fully paid their taxes (total of 268 out of 36,362). As part of this update, PNB said, “PHC has communicated that it is actively exploring alternative approaches that will align with its goal of facilitating the successful listing with the PSE.”
>    - ***MB:*** What an ugly mess. My inbox has emails from over 200 PNB shareholders complaining about how they’ve been treated by PNB through this process, complaining about how confusing the requirements are, and about how little assistance they’ve received from PNB. In just a few weeks, this trainwreck will have been going on for four years, with no clear end in sight. They’ve only put together compliant documentation packages (eCAR + taxes paid) for just 0.7% of eligible shareholders. The only “positive” here is that they’ve made a tiny bit of progress on getting eCARs (which is PNB’s responsibility), but at the current pace (313 eCARs per quarter), it’s going to take PNB another 112 quarters to process all the eCARs for the eligible shareholders. While I’m guilty of being a little silly by saying that, the numbers simply don’t lie. That’s the trend. It’s up to PNB to do better, or it’s up to one of the regulators to step in and “incentivise” PNB to do better if it’s unable to figure this out on its own. This should never happen again. Remember when **DITO** [DITO 2.10 ▼5.8%; 106% avgVol] screwed up so bad it made the PSE step in to make new rules to protect the integrity of the market’s reputation? Whatever “this” is has risen to that level. **PNB Rule** when?

>- **[FOLLOW-UP]  Do the Personal Spending Audit challenge with friends?...** One reader wrote in to tell me that they’ve decided to take the **Personal Spending Audit** challenge with a group of friends. They all downloaded the template ([available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hp4tnxRb9HpjtWJ_mxFbWdfH4wo6XumosLIOa_xgnSY/edit?usp=sharing)) and have committed to track their spending together through to the end of the month. Apparently, they’ve already made a few insights by just sharing their surprise findings with each other over a Saturday morning coffee, so that’s awesome. If your friends need any push to get started, maybe forward my [PSA setup email](https://mailchi.mp/c7382b962bce/take-the-mb-personal-spending-audit-challenge?e=933945058a) and then send them this [MB survey link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfH6QkFJe44uM-hTC5hKbVmm2OUDQC3DyDRYtccuOMmdkwXTQ/viewform?usp=sharing) where they can tell me a bit about their PSA setup process and enter to win one of TEN ₱200 Grab Food vouchers.
>    - ***MB:*** My goal with the survey is to learn what works and what doesn’t so that I can improve this process for when I run it again in H2 or at the start of next year. It will also help me fine-tune what I focus on going forward, so I don’t end up wasting time droning on about topics that maybe only I really care about (like my weird “forced savings” tactic). At the end of the month, I want to do another survey to hear about what insights you were able to make by seeing your spending in all its vulgar detail, and share those insights with the rest of the readership. The more people who take part, the more feedback I get, and the more shared learning we can do. This could be very interesting, but you really need to do the work (the PSA) to get the benefit. That’s the main reason for the incentive. I don’t have any sponsors for this, it’s just straight out of my pocket because I think this is so important. Join me!

She invited me and I didn't invite myself. Convo continues and she tried to go to the bathroom, but there were a few people in line. I offered to go to another spot if she had to go bad enough. She said no that's okay and she actually has to go home to get some things done. Date was literally an hour on the dot. I think she had to poop. Dropped her off at her house, gave her a car hug bc I was pulled over on the side of the road. She made a comment about the car hug. Said she would let me know about meeting up later.

We get my son raising canes and I wanted Mexican rice. My husband wanted flautas and the restaurant I was going to order from didn’t have them. So I was offering another Mexican restaurant and mid sentence he starts screaming saying he doesn’t freaking care just for me to make up my mind. 

I told him that I already made up my mind, but was going to pick another restaurant so he can have the food he wanted too. We started arguing because I was upset he yelled and didn’t let me finish my sentence. Then he told me “fu*k you”. 

After that we pulled into sonic because I told him just to go there for the coffee I wanted earlier. I was so upset and told him to put his phone down so we can talk. He continues to watch Tik Tok and ignore me. I continue to ask him to put down his phone. And telling him he needs to say sorry. He after 15 mins said “sorry” while looking at his phone. 

He is very mean and since I wouldn’t order my coffee before he told me sorry he started driving home. 

I continued to ask if we can talk because it hurt my feelings and he continued to ignore me. Before getting back home he turned into a parking lot. I told him how much he is abusing me and how bad it really hurt my feelings. I was crying. He continues to ignore me.

I finally stop crying and get a drive through. We eat in silence, only his tik tok video playing. We get home, he hops straight on his game that’s in another room. 

My son had his headphones and IPad on in the car. Sadly he saw us argue. I really hate that my son has gone through this. 

My husband is so mean to me. All I did was ask if he wanted another restaurant and he blew up. I’m always so caring to him, but he never appreciated me. 

I even went into the store while he sat in the car and bought him new pants the other day. He didn’t even look at them. I was also going to spend 650$ on new PC parts for him. And he was so unappreciative and mentioned “if you don’t buy it I’ll just buy it myself”. 

Will medicine from the dr help? Sometimes he’s nice to me. Mostly in bed. 😞

#### Chapter 5: A Plan in Motion

The subway rattled along the tracks, a metallic beast carrying us deeper into the labyrinth of New York. I could see the anxiety etched on Mildred’s face as we sat in the flickering light of the train. The rhythmic clatter of the wheels provided a strange comfort, but I knew the real danger was far from over.

“Where are we headed?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“Somewhere safe,” I replied. “We need to regroup and figure out our next move. We can’t stay on the run forever.”

The train screeched to a halt at the next station, and I glanced at Mildred. “Stay close to me.” We stepped off, blending into the crowd that poured onto the platform. I led her through the maze of commuters, my eyes scanning for any sign of Fonzie’s men.

We exited the station and found ourselves in a bustling neighborhood, the streets alive with the sounds of late-night diners and street vendors. I chose a small, inconspicuous café tucked away in a side street—it was one of my old haunts, a place where I could trust the owner to keep his mouth shut.

Inside, the warm glow of the lights and the rich aroma of coffee provided a brief respite from the chaos outside. I led Mildred to a quiet booth in the back, where we could talk without being overheard.

“Order something,” I said as I slid into the seat. “I’ll be right back.” I needed to think, to strategize. I headed to the counter, ordering two black coffees. While I waited, I glanced around, every nerve on edge, hoping to spot any familiar faces.

When I returned to the booth, I slid a cup in front of Mildred. “Here. It’ll help clear your head.”

She took a sip, her hands trembling slightly. “What do we do now, George?”

I leaned in closer, lowering my voice. “We need to find out more about the artifact—what it is, who else is involved, and how we can use that information against Fonzie. If we can understand what he wants with it, we might be able to turn the tables.”

Mildred nodded, her expression thoughtful. “I remember him mentioning a contact. Someone in the Ukraine. They were supposed to meet soon to finalize the deal for the artifact.”

“That’s a start,” I said, my mind racing. “Do you know when that meeting is taking place?”

“I think it’s tomorrow night,” she replied, her brow furrowing in concentration. “He was anxious about it. We need to act fast.”

“Then we’ll need a plan,” I said, determination surging through me. “We can’t confront them directly, but if we can get intel on the meeting, we might be able to catch them off guard.”

Mildred looked around, her voice barely a whisper. “What if we could use the artifice against them? If we could get to the artifact first…”

I could see the spark of an idea forming in her eyes. “That could work. If we can find the location where they’re keeping it, we might be able to turn it into a trap for Fonzie and his crew.”

“Do you think it’s that simple?” she asked, a hint of skepticism in her tone.

“Nothing about this is simple,” I replied, “but we have to try. We need to gather more intel. If we can find out where the artifact is stored, we can set a plan in motion.”

After finishing our coffee, we left the café and stepped back into the bustling street. The city felt alive around us, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that danger lurked just beyond the shadows.

“Let’s head back to my place,” I suggested. “There’s a chance Fonzie doesn’t know about this café, and we can use my resources to dig deeper into his network.”

As we walked, I kept my eyes peeled for any signs of trouble. The last thing we needed was for Fonzie’s men to catch up with us. My apartment wasn’t far, and I hoped we could lay low for a while.

Once we arrived, I quickly secured the door and led Mildred to my makeshift office. I had a few connections in the city who might be able to help us track down Fonzie’s contacts, and I needed to reach out to them.

“Sit tight,” I said, pulling out my laptop. “I’ll see what I can find.”

Mildred perched on the edge of the chair, her anxiety evident. “What if they find us here?”

“They won’t,” I assured her, though I couldn’t completely shake my own worries. “I’ve got a few tricks up my sleeve.”

I began typing, searching for anything related to Fonzie, the artifact, or the rumored meeting. I combed through news articles, police reports, and underground forums, trying to piece together the puzzle. Time slipped away as I lost myself in the search.

After a while, I stumbled upon something intriguing—a forum post discussing a recent shipment linked to an underground auction in the city. The post mentioned a mysterious artifact from Crimea that had caught the attention of several high-profile criminals, including Fonzie.

“This could be it,” I said, turning to Mildred. “If we can infiltrate this auction, we might find the artifact and the buyers.”

Mildred leaned closer, her eyes wide with excitement. “But how do we get in?”

I thought for a moment, then an idea struck me. “I have a contact—an old friend who runs security for high-profile events. If we can convince him to let us in as part of the staff, we can gather intel without raising suspicions.”

“Do you think he’ll help us?” she asked, her voice filled with hope.

“He owes me a favor,” I replied, already pulling out my phone. “Let’s see if he’s available.”

I dialed the number, my heart racing as it rang. After a few tense moments, a familiar voice answered. “George? It’s been a while.”

“Yeah, it has, Tom. I need a favor. I’m looking to get into an underground auction tomorrow night. Can you help me out?”

There was a pause on the other end, then Tom replied. “I might be able to pull some strings. But you know how these things go—it’s risky.”

“I understand the risks, but I need to do this. Lives are at stake,” I urged, glancing at Mildred, who was listening intently.

“All right, I’ll see what I can do. Just be careful, George. I don’t want to see you get hurt.”

“Thanks, Tom. I owe you one,” I said, relief flooding through me as I hung up.

I turned to Mildred, a determined look on my face. “We’re in. Tomorrow night, we’ll infiltrate the auction and find out everything we can about the artifact and Fonzie’s plans.”

“Are you ready for this?” she asked, her eyes searching mine.

I nodded, the adrenaline coursing through me. “We’ll do this together. But we need to be smart and stay one step ahead.”

As the night wore on, we made our preparations, laying the groundwork for the next day’s mission. We discussed every detail, every potential outcome, our resolve strengthening with each passing moment.

Tomorrow, we would step into the lion’s den, and I would do everything in my power to protect Mildred and uncover the truth behind Fonzie’s dangerous game. The stakes had never been higher, but I knew we were ready to face whatever awaited us.### The Secret of the Detective
#### Chapter 6: The Auction

Morning broke over New York, the sun casting a golden hue over the bustling streets. I woke up the next day to a mix of anxiety and determination churning in my stomach. Today was the day we would infiltrate the underground auction, and everything hinged on our ability to stay under the radar.

Mildred was already awake, her expression a blend of apprehension and resolve. “Are you sure about this?” she asked, her voice steady but laced with concern.

I nodded, adjusting my collar in the mirror. “We’re going to get through this. We just need to stick to the plan and stay focused.”

I had arranged for Tom to meet us at a discreet location near the auction site. He would provide us with the necessary credentials to blend in with the staff. As we prepared, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the clock was ticking, that time was slipping through our fingers like sand.

After a quick breakfast, we set out, my heart pounding with each step. The auction was being held in a repurposed warehouse in Brooklyn, a location known for hosting high-profile, albeit illegal, events. As we approached, I could see the hustle and bustle of people setting up, the air thick with tension and expectation.

“Stay close,” I whispered to Mildred as we navigated through the crowd. I spotted Tom near the entrance, his tall frame silhouetted against the bright lights inside.

“George!” he called out, waving us over. “You made it.”

“Thanks for this, Tom,” I said, shaking his hand firmly. “We really appreciate it.”

He nodded, his expression serious. “Just remember to keep your heads down. This crowd isn’t friendly, and Fonzie’s men are likely here.”

“Understood,” I replied, glancing around the room. The atmosphere was electric, filled with the buzz of conversation and the clinking of glasses. I could see a lavish display of artifacts and artworks lining the walls, but my focus was on the task at hand.

“Here are your badges,” Tom said, handing us two laminated passes. “You’ll be able to move freely as part of the staff. Just act natural, and don’t draw attention to yourselves.”

“Got it,” I said, putting the badge around my neck. Mildred did the same, her eyes wide as she took in the scene.

“Stay in touch through these,” Tom added, handing me a small earpiece. “If anything goes wrong, let me know.”

As we stepped into the main area of the auction, the atmosphere shifted. The lights dimmed, and a spotlight focused on a sleek podium at the front of the room. I could see a group of well-dressed attendees milling about, their expressions a mix of excitement and greed.

“Let’s split up and gather information,” I suggested, scanning the room for any sign of Fonzie. “I’ll head to the back where they’re storing the artifacts. You try to find out who’s in charge of the auction.”

Mildred nodded, her expression resolute. “Be careful, George.”

“I will,” I promised, then turned to weave through the crowd.

As I made my way toward the back, I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. Every glance felt like a spotlight, every shadow a potential threat. I approached a group of staff members standing near a set of double doors, their voices low and conspiratorial.

“Have you seen Fonzie?” one of them asked, his voice tense.

“Yeah, he’s been pacing like a caged animal,” another replied. “He’s nervous about the artifact.”

I leaned in closer, catching snippets of their conversation. “If this deal goes south, it’ll be on all of us. We can’t afford any mistakes tonight.”

My heart raced. Fonzie was here, and the stakes were higher than ever. I needed to find him before he found us.

I slipped through the double doors and entered a storage area filled with crates and boxes. The atmosphere felt charged, and I could hear muffled voices coming from a nearby room. I approached cautiously, peering through a small window.

Inside, I spotted Fonzie, flanked by two of his men. He was gesturing animatedly, speaking to an older man with an air of authority. The man’s suit was expensive, and his demeanor suggested he was someone important in the criminal world.

“—if we get this artifact, the deal is ours,” Fonzie was saying, his voice dripping with ambition.

I strained to listen, knowing this was the information I needed. “And what about the girl?” the older man asked, a frown creasing his forehead. “We can’t have any loose ends.”

“Don’t worry,” Fonzie replied, a sinister smile creeping onto his face. “I have a plan for her. Once the deal is done, she won’t be a problem anymore.”

A cold shiver ran down my spine. I couldn’t let that happen. I had to warn Mildred and find a way to stop them. Just as I was about to back away, a loud crash echoed through the room, and I jumped, adrenaline surging.

I turned to see a group of masked men bursting through the main entrance, brandishing weapons and shouting. The atmosphere shifted from anticipation to chaos in an instant.

“Everybody down!” one of the intruders yelled, and panic erupted in the room.

I ducked behind a crate, my heart racing. This was not how I had envisioned the night unfolding. I quickly activated my earpiece. “Tom, we have a situation! There are armed men in the auction!”

“Copy that! I’m on my way!” he replied, urgency in his voice.

I glanced back through the window, trying to assess the scene. Fonzie’s demeanor changed instantly; he was no longer the confident player but a cornered animal, eyes darting around for an escape route.

“Mildred!” I muttered under my breath, my thoughts racing. I had to get to her before things escalated further.

I crept back toward the main area, avoiding the chaos and ducking behind tables and crates. The sound of shouting filled the air, and I could see people scrambling for exits, desperate to escape the madness.

Just then, I spotted Mildred in the throng, her eyes wide with fear as she clutched her badge. “George!” she called out, her voice barely audible over the chaos.

I rushed toward her, grabbing her hand. “We need to get out of here!” I shouted, pulling her toward the nearest exit.

As we made our way through the chaos, I felt a surge of determination. We couldn’t let Fonzie or these intruders win. We had to find a way to expose them, to turn this night around.

“Where’s Tom?” Mildred asked as we reached the back door.

“I don’t know, but we can’t wait for him,” I replied, pushing the door open. “We have to find a way to regroup and come up with a plan.”

The night was far from over, and the danger was just beginning. But one thing was clear: we weren’t backing down. Together, we would face whatever lay ahead, and I was ready to fight for Mildred’s safety—and for the truth.### The Secret of the Detective
#### Chapter 7: The Calm Before the Storm

The ride through the city felt surreal as the adrenaline from the auction began to wear off. Mildred and I sat in the back of the sedan, the tension palpable in the air. The driver, a no-nonsense type, focused intently on the road, his knuckles white against the steering wheel as he navigated through the bustling streets of Brooklyn.

“Where are we headed?” Mildred asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

“To a safe house,” the driver replied curtly, not taking his eyes off the road. “Tom arranged it. We’ll regroup there and figure out our next move.”

I glanced at Mildred, her face a mixture of fear and determination. I could see how the events of the night had weighed heavily on her, and I felt a surge of protectiveness. “We’re going to be okay,” I reassured her, trying to convey confidence despite the turmoil swirling in my mind.

As we drove, I replayed the chaos of the auction in my head. The masked intruders, the gunshots, Fonzie’s cold demeanor—it all felt like a nightmare from which I couldn’t wake. I needed to focus on what came next. We had to gather information, find a way to turn the tables on Fonzie, and most importantly, keep Mildred safe.

The car finally pulled into a quiet residential street, the kind that felt worlds away from the chaos we had just escaped. The driver parked in front of a modest brownstone and turned to us. “This is it. Stay close, and keep your heads down.”

We climbed out of the car, and I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. The air here felt different—calmer, almost peaceful. I led Mildred up the steps, my mind racing with possibilities.

Inside, the safe house was surprisingly cozy, with warm lighting and comfortable furniture. Tom was already there, pacing the small living room as he glanced up when we entered.

“Thank God you made it!” he exclaimed, rushing over to us. “I was worried the whole place would go up in flames.”

“It almost did,” I said, shaking my head. “What the hell happened back there?”

Tom’s expression turned serious. “The masked men came in like they owned the place. They were looking for something specific, and I’m guessing it was you two. Fonzie’s crew is in disarray, but they won’t stop until they find you.”

Mildred crossed her arms, her brow furrowing. “What do we do now? We can’t just sit here and wait for them to come after us.”

“Agreed,” I replied, my mind racing. “We need to find out what Fonzie is planning and how the artifact fits into all of this. We can’t let him get away with whatever he’s trying to do.”

Tom nodded, his eyes narrowing. “I have a few contacts who might know more about the artifact. I can reach out to them, but it’s going to take some time. Meanwhile, we need to lay low.”

“Laying low isn’t going to solve anything,” I said, frustration creeping into my voice. “We need to take action.”

“Let’s focus on gathering intel first,” Tom suggested. “Once we know more, we can formulate a plan to confront him.”

I took a deep breath, trying to rein in my impatience. “Fine. Let’s see what you can find out, Tom. Mildred and I can brainstorm what our next steps should be.”

As Tom made his calls, I sat down with Mildred at the small kitchen table. “What are you thinking?” she asked, her eyes searching mine.

“I think we need to find out more about this artifact,” I said, leaning forward. “If we can understand its significance, we might be able to leverage that against Fonzie.”

Mildred nodded slowly. “He mentioned something about its power during one of our conversations. He was obsessed with it.”

“Power,” I repeated, the word hanging in the air. “What kind of power? Is it just valuable, or is there something more?”

“I don’t know,” she admitted, her brow furrowing in thought. “But it seemed important to him. He was willing to go to great lengths to get it.”

“Then we need to find out where it’s being kept,” I said, my mind racing with possibilities. “If we can locate it, we might be able to sabotage Fonzie’s plans.”

Just then, Tom returned, his expression serious. “I’ve got some information. One of my contacts said they overheard Fonzie talking about a meeting tonight at one of his warehouses. He’s planning to finalize the deal for the artifact.”

“Tonight?” I asked incredulously. “We need to get there.”

“Are you crazy?” Tom said, disbelief flashing across his face. “It’s too risky. Fonzie will have his entire crew there.”

“We can’t let this opportunity slip through our fingers,” I insisted. “If we can get in and gather intel on the artifact and his plans, we might finally have the leverage we need.”

Mildred looked between us, her expression resolute. “I’m with George. We have to do this.”

“Alright,” Tom said reluctantly. “But we need a solid plan. If we’re going to pull this off, we can’t just rush in.”

I nodded, feeling a surge of determination. “We’ll need disguises to blend in with his crew. If we can manage that, we might get close enough to overhear their conversations.”

Tom thought for a moment. “I know a few places where we can get what we need. But we have to be quick.”

“Let’s do it,” I said, my heart racing. “Tonight, we take the fight to Fonzie.”

As we prepared to leave the safe house, a sense of urgency filled the air. We were stepping into the lion’s den, but I couldn’t back down now. The stakes were too high, and Mildred’s safety was my priority.

As we made our way through the quiet Brooklyn streets, I felt the weight of the world on my shoulders. I had to protect her and uncover the truth behind Fonzie’s plans. We were running out of time, and tonight would determine everything. 

With every step, I felt the thrill of the chase igniting within me, propelling me forward into the heart of danger. We were ready to face whatever awaited us in the shadows. ### The Secret of the Detective
#### Chapter 8: A Desperate Escape

The chaos inside the auction hall was palpable as we pushed through the crowd, people scrambling for safety. The sound of gunshots rang out, sending waves of panic through the crowd. I could feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins as I led Mildred toward the back exit.

“Stay close!” I shouted above the cacophony, my grip tightening on her hand. We wove through the throng, ducking behind tables and crates, avoiding the chaos erupting around us.

“Where do we go?” Mildred asked, her voice tinged with fear.

“There’s a fire escape at the back,” I replied, keeping my eyes peeled for any sign of danger. “We can make it out that way.”

As we reached the back of the hall, I spotted the fire escape door. It was slightly ajar, and I pushed it open, urging Mildred to go through first. “Hurry!” I urged, glancing back at the still-chaotic scene.

We stepped outside into the cool night air, but our relief was short-lived. The alley behind the warehouse was dimly lit, and I could hear shouting echoing from the auction hall. Fonzie’s men were searching for us.

“Which way?” Mildred asked, her eyes darting around.

“Down this alley,” I said, leading her further into the shadows. We hurried along, the sound of footsteps growing louder behind us. I glanced back to see silhouettes emerging from the entrance of the building, scanning the area.

“We need to find a place to hide,” I said, my heart racing. We turned a corner and spotted a row of dumpsters against the wall. “In there!” I whispered urgently, pulling her behind one of the dumpsters.

We crouched low, trying to control our breathing as the footsteps echoed closer. I could hear their voices now, angry and frustrated.

“Where did they go?” one of them shouted. “They can’t have gotten far!”

“Check the alleys!” another voice barked. “They couldn’t have vanished into thin air!”

My heart pounded in my chest as I peered around the dumpster, watching as two of Fonzie’s men split off in different directions. I knew we had to move quickly before they caught our scent.

“Now’s our chance,” I whispered. “Follow me.”

We slipped out from behind the dumpster and continued down the alley, moving as silently as possible. I had no idea where we were heading, but we needed to put as much distance between us and the auction hall as possible.

After a few blocks, we emerged onto a busier street. The noise of the city enveloped us, and I felt a glimmer of hope. “We should be safe here for a moment,” I said, glancing around. “Let’s find a place to regroup and figure out our next step.”

We ducked into a small diner that was still open, the neon sign buzzing above the door. As we entered, the warm light and the smell of coffee enveloped us. I quickly scanned the room, noting the scattered patrons and the weary waitress behind the counter.

“Sit down,” I instructed Mildred, sliding into a booth at the back. I needed to think, to gather my thoughts before we made any further moves.

“What now?” Mildred asked, her voice low and tense.

“First, we need to get in touch with Tom,” I said, pulling out my phone. “He might have a better idea of what’s going on.”

I dialed his number, my mind racing as it rang. After a moment, I heard his voice on the other end. “George! Are you okay?”

“We’re safe for now, but we need a plan. What’s happening at the auction?”

“It’s chaos. The masked men are raiding the place, and Fonzie is trying to rally his crew. They’re looking for you two specifically.”

“Damn it,” I muttered, rubbing my temples. “We need to get out of here. Can you arrange for us to be picked up?”

“On it. Just hold tight. I’ll send someone to your location.”

“Thanks, Tom. We’ll be waiting.” I hung up, glancing at Mildred, who was watching me with a mix of concern and determination.

“What did he say?” she asked.

“He’s sending someone to pick us up,” I replied. “We just need to stay put and keep our heads down.”

As we sat in the booth, I couldn’t shake the feeling of impending danger. The diner felt like a temporary sanctuary, but I knew we couldn’t stay here for long. Fonzie’s men were still out there, and they wouldn’t stop until they found us.

Minutes felt like hours as we waited, the chatter of the diner fading into the background. I glanced out the window, scanning the street for any sign of trouble. Just then, I spotted a black sedan pulling up across the street, the engine idling.

“That’s our ride,” I said, nudging Mildred. “Let’s go.”

We slipped out of the booth and made our way toward the door, but just as we stepped outside, I froze. A group of men had gathered on the opposite side of the street, their eyes scanning the area. I recognized one of them—Fonzie’s right-hand man.

“Go back inside!” I hissed at Mildred, pulling her back just in time. We ducked behind a nearby car, our hearts racing as we watched the men move closer.

“They’re looking for us,” Mildred whispered, panic creeping into her voice.

“They can’t see us,” I replied, my mind racing. “We need to wait for the right moment.”

The men began to spread out, their search becoming more frantic. I could see Fonzie’s right-hand man gesturing angrily, his face twisted with frustration. “They have to be around here somewhere!” he yelled.

I felt Mildred’s hand tighten around mine, fear radiating from her. “What if they find us?” she asked, her voice shaking.

“We won’t let that happen,” I said, trying to keep my own fear in check. “We just need to be patient.”

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the men began to move in the opposite direction, their voices fading into the distance. I turned to Mildred, relief washing over me. “Let’s go. Now!”

We darted toward the sedan, my heart racing as I approached the driver’s side. I opened the door, and Tom’s contact—a burly man with a serious expression—looked up at us. “Get in!” he urged.

We climbed into the back seat, and the driver wasted no time. “Hold on,” he said, pulling away from the curb and speeding off down the street.

As we drove through the city, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. We were safe, at least for now. But I knew Fonzie wouldn’t give up easily. The game was far from over, and we still had to uncover the truth behind the artifact and the men chasing us.

Mildred leaned back in her seat, her eyes reflecting a mix of exhaustion and determination. “What’s next, George?” she asked, her voice steady.

I took a deep breath, formulating a plan. “We regroup, gather what we know, and then we hit Fonzie where it hurts. We can’t just run; we need to expose him for what he really is.”

She nodded, her resolve shining through. “I’m with you. Whatever it takes.”

As the city lights blurred past us, I felt a renewed sense of purpose. We were in this together, and I wouldn’t let anything happen to her. We would uncover the truth, no matter the cost. The battle was just beginning, and I was ready to face whatever darkness lay ahead.",1,1736724417.0,ebooklibri,0,1.0,False

#### Chapter 1: Shadows of New York

The streets of New York were alive, pulsing with an energy that was both intoxicating and overwhelming. I stepped out of my cramped apartment in the Lower East Side, the smell of pretzels and hot dogs wafting through the air, mingling with the distant sounds of jazz spilling from a nearby club. My name is George, and I’m a detective—though sometimes it feels more like I’m a ghost, floating through the shadows of this sprawling city.

As I walked past the bustling crowds, I couldn't help but think of the case that had landed in my lap just a day before. It all started when Mildred, an old friend from my college days, reached out to me. She was in a bind, and I could hear the desperation in her voice. 

“George, I need your help,” she had said, her tone a mix of urgency and fear. “It’s about Fonzie.”

Fonzie. Just the name sent a shiver down my spine. He was a notorious figure in the underbelly of New York, known for his charm as much as his ruthlessness. Mildred had been dating him for months, and I could only imagine the kind of trouble she had gotten herself into.

As I made my way to our meeting spot—a small, dimly lit café on the corner of Bleeker Street—I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was walking into a trap. The Crimea, a conflict far away, felt like a distant echo, but here in New York, the real battle was unfolding right in front of me. I had seen my fair share of crime and deceit, but this was different. This was personal.

When I arrived, Mildred was already there, her expression a mix of worry and determination. She wore a dark coat that contrasted sharply with her pale skin, and her eyes looked deeper than I remembered. 

“Thank you for coming,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “I don’t know who else to turn to.”

I motioned for her to sit and ordered us coffee. The steam curled up between us, and for a moment, the café felt like a refuge from the chaos outside. 

“Mildred, what’s going on?” I asked, leaning in closer. 

“It’s Fonzie. He’s involved in something…something dangerous. I found out he’s mixed up with some people from Crimea, and they’re looking for something. I don’t know what it is, but they won’t stop until they get it.”

My heart raced. The shadows of the city seemed to close in around us, and I could feel the weight of her words. “What do you mean, ‘something dangerous’?” 

She hesitated, her eyes darting around as if she expected someone to overhear us. “I overheard him talking about a shipment—a valuable artifact. Something that could change everything. I didn’t think he was serious at first, but then I saw the men he was meeting with. They’re not the kind of people you want to mess with, George.”

I took a deep breath, piecing together the fragments of her story. Fonzie was a player in a game much larger than either of us could comprehend, and now Mildred was caught in the middle. 

“We need to get to the bottom of this,” I said, my voice steady. “I can’t let you get hurt.”

The determination in her eyes flickered with hope, but I could see the fear lurking just beneath the surface. “Promise me you’ll be careful,” she replied, her hands trembling slightly. 

I nodded, knowing full well the dangers that lay ahead. The streets of New York were filled with secrets, and it was time to uncover the truth behind Fonzie and the shadowy connections to Crimea. Little did I know, this journey would take us deeper into a world of intrigue, betrayal, and unexpected alliances.

As I left the café, the bustling city felt like a labyrinth, each turn bringing me closer to the heart of a mystery that was only just beginning to unfold. The shadows whispered secrets, and I was determined to shine a light on them, no matter the cost.### The Secret of the Detective
#### Chapter 2: Into the Abyss

The streets of New York had a way of transforming at night, becoming a labyrinth of shadows and whispering secrets. As I stepped out of the café, the air was thick with anticipation. Mildred’s words echoed in my mind, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.

I decided to head to Fonzie’s usual haunts, places where he liked to flaunt his power. The first stop was a nightclub in the Bowery, a place known for its raucous atmosphere and dubious clientele. As I approached, the bass of the music pulsated through the ground, and the neon lights flickered like a beacon in the dark.

Inside, the crowd swayed to the rhythm, a mix of laughter and shouts blending into a cacophony of noise. I scanned the room, searching for any sign of Fonzie. After a few minutes, I spotted him in a corner booth, surrounded by an entourage that looked like they belonged in a gangster film—sharp suits, slicked-back hair, and an air of menace that was palpable.

I slipped into the shadows, positioning myself where I could hear their conversation without being seen. Fonzie was leaning back, a cigarette dangling from his lips, as he spoke animatedly to a man who looked like he had just stepped out of a military academy.

“Are we sure the shipment is on schedule?” Fonzie asked, his voice low but commanding.

“Absolutely,” the man replied, adjusting his cufflinks. “But we need to be careful. The authorities are getting wind of our activities. We can’t afford any mistakes.”

My heart raced. This wasn’t just a petty crime; this was something much larger. I leaned in closer, straining to catch every word.

“And what about the girl?” the military man continued. “If she knows anything, we can’t let her get in our way.”

My stomach dropped. They were talking about Mildred. I had to warn her, but I needed more information first. I slipped out of the club and into the night, my mind racing.

Back on the streets, I pulled out my phone and dialed Mildred’s number. It rang twice before she picked up, her voice laced with concern. “George? Is everything okay?”

“Not exactly,” I replied, glancing around to ensure no one was listening. “You need to be careful. I just overheard Fonzie talking about you. He thinks you know something.”

Silence hung between us for a moment. “What do you mean?” she finally asked, her voice trembling.

“They’re planning something big, Mildred. If you get caught in the crossfire...”

“I won’t let that happen. I’ll be careful,” she interrupted, determination creeping back into her tone. “But what do we do now?”

“We need to find out what this shipment is and who else is involved. I’ll dig deeper. Just stay low for a while.”

After we hung up, I felt the weight of the world settle on my shoulders. I knew I was stepping into dangerous territory, but I couldn’t back down. Mildred was counting on me.

My next stop was an old informant of mine, a man named Benny who lived in a rundown apartment in Hell’s Kitchen. Benny had his ear to the ground and knew the ins and outs of the city’s underbelly. If anyone had information about Fonzie’s dealings, it would be him.

As I walked through the dimly lit streets, I recalled my encounters with Benny over the years. He was a strange character—part philosopher, part schemer, but he had a soft spot for me. I hoped that tonight would be one of those nights where he’d be willing to share what he knew.

After a few wrong turns, I found myself standing in front of a dilapidated building. The paint was peeling, and the flickering light above the entrance made it look like something out of a horror movie. I took a deep breath and pushed the door open.

Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale cigarettes and something that resembled desperation. I climbed the creaky stairs to Benny’s floor and knocked on his door.

“Who is it?” came a raspy voice from the other side.

“It’s George,” I replied, trying to keep my tone casual. “I need to talk.”

The door creaked open, and Benny stood there, his wild hair and mismatched clothes giving him the look of a man who had seen too much. “George! Come in, come in. You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I stepped inside, and he closed the door behind me. “I need information about Fonzie and a shipment he’s involved in,” I said, cutting straight to the chase.

Benny’s eyes narrowed, and he leaned against the wall, arms crossed. “That’s dangerous territory, my friend. Fonzie doesn’t take kindly to snoopers.”

“I’m aware,” I replied, feeling a chill run down my spine. “But this is about Mildred. She’s in the middle of this mess, and I can’t let anything happen to her.”

Benny sighed, his face softening. “Alright, I might have heard some things. But you didn’t get this from me.”

He pulled out a piece of paper and scribbled something down. “There’s a meeting happening tomorrow night at an old warehouse on the docks. They’ll be discussing the shipment. If you want to know what’s really going on, that’s your ticket in.”

I took the note, my heart racing with a mix of fear and determination. “Thank you, Benny. You might have just saved her life.”

“Just be careful, George. The deeper you go, the harder it is to come back.” 

As I left Benny’s apartment, the weight of his words hung in the air. I felt a storm brewing, and I was right in its path. But I wouldn’t back down. Not now.

Tomorrow night, I would confront the darkness lurking behind Fonzie and the secrets that had ensnared Mildred. The shadows were closing in, but I was ready to face whatever awaited me in the abyss.### The Secret of the Detective
#### Chapter 3: The Meeting

The night before the meeting felt heavy with anticipation, as if the city itself was holding its breath. I spent the day trying to gather my thoughts, piecing together the fragments of information I had about Fonzie and the mysterious shipment. The closer I got to the truth, the more dangerous the game became. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being pulled into a web far beyond my control.

As darkness fell, I prepared myself for what lay ahead. I slipped into a dark jacket and pulled on my oldest pair of jeans, opting for practicality over style. I knew I’d need to blend in, so I left my usual detective badge behind. In this world, badges didn’t mean much; survival did.

I made my way to the docks, the salty air mingling with the faint sounds of waves lapping against the pier. The moon hung low in the sky, casting an eerie glow over the water. I found the warehouse Benny had mentioned, a crumbling structure that looked as if it had stood for decades—silent and foreboding.

I parked my car a few blocks away and approached on foot, my heart pounding in my chest. As I got closer, I noticed a flickering light spilling out from the cracked windows, along with muffled voices. I pressed myself against the wall, straining to hear.

“—need to move fast. If we don’t get the artifact out of here before the authorities catch wind, we’re done,” a voice growled.

“It’s too risky! We can’t afford to lose it,” another replied, their tone laced with urgency.

I took a deep breath, my instincts kicking in. This was it—the moment I had been preparing for. I glanced around, looking for a way in. The door was slightly ajar, and after a quick look over my shoulder, I slipped inside.

The interior was dimly lit, filled with crates and shadows. I could see a group of men gathered around a table in the center of the room, their faces obscured by the low light. I recognized Fonzie immediately, leaning back in his chair with an air of confidence that made my skin crawl.

“Listen up!” he commanded, his voice cutting through the murmur of conversation. “Tomorrow, we’re moving the shipment. No mistakes. This is our chance to make a fortune.”

I ducked behind a stack of crates, my heart racing as I listened intently. The men around him nodded, their expressions a mix of excitement and apprehension.

“What are we dealing with?” one of them asked. “We can’t risk drawing attention.”

Fonzie leaned forward, his eyes narrowing. “It’s an artifact from Crimea—something powerful. If we sell it to the right buyer, we’ll be set for life. But if we’re caught…” He trailed off, and the tension in the room thickened.

I glanced around the dimly lit space, searching for any sign of Mildred. I had to find her; I couldn’t let her get caught up in this mess. I scanned the room, noticing a door at the far end that seemed to lead to an office. It was my best chance.

As quietly as I could, I slipped away from the group and headed toward the door. I could hear Fonzie’s voice rising again, but I couldn’t focus on that now. I had to get to Mildred before it was too late.

I pushed the door open slightly and stepped inside. The room was surprisingly clean, with a desk cluttered with papers and a large map of the city pinned to the wall. But my focus was on the small closet in the corner. I approached it cautiously, my heart pounding in my ears.

I opened the door, and there she was—Mildred, tied to a chair, her eyes wide with fear but filled with relief when she saw me.

“George!” she exclaimed, her voice a mix of joy and panic. “You shouldn’t have come here!”

“Shh, we don’t have much time,” I whispered, quickly assessing her bindings. “I’m getting you out of here.”

I pulled out my pocket knife and began slicing through the rope that bound her wrists. “What did they do to you?” I asked, keeping my voice low.

“I overheard too much,” she said, her voice shaky. “They caught me snooping around. I thought I could find out more about the shipment, but they…” She sighed, fear creeping back into her expression. “They think I know something important.”

“You don’t have to worry about that anymore,” I said firmly, finally freeing her hands. “We need to get out of here before Fonzie realizes I’m gone.”

Just as I helped her to her feet, I heard footsteps approaching. Panic surged through me. “Quick, hide!” I urged, pushing her into the closet and closing the door just as the door to the office swung open.

Fonzie entered, his demeanor tense. “Where the hell is she?” he barked at his men, who were now filing into the room behind him.

I held my breath, praying they wouldn’t notice me. My heart raced as I listened to them argue about the shipment and Mildred’s whereabouts. The room felt electric with tension, and I could see Fonzie’s frustration boiling over.

“We need to find her before the deal goes down,” he snapped, running a hand through his hair. “If she talks…”

I couldn’t stay here any longer. I glanced around, searching for an escape route. There was a window on the far side of the room, but it would be a risk to try and make a break for it.

Suddenly, I heard Mildred’s muffled voice from the closet, and my stomach dropped. “George, please!” she whispered urgently.

I shot her a look, trying to convey my panic. Fonzie's men turned toward the closet, suspicion flickering in their eyes. “Check that closet!” one of them shouted.

In that instant, I knew I had to act. I lunged for the window, throwing it open and climbing out just as the door to the closet swung open. I heard them shouting behind me, but adrenaline fueled my escape.

I landed hard on the ground outside, rolling to absorb the impact. I looked back just in time to see Fonzie’s men pouring out of the warehouse, their faces twisted with rage.

“Mildred!” I shouted, panic setting in. I had to get her out. I turned and ran, knowing that the shadows of New York were my only allies now. The chase had begun, and I was determined to keep her safe, no matter the cost.### The Secret of the Detective
#### Chapter 4: The Chase

The night air was cold against my skin as I sprinted away from the warehouse, my heart pounding in rhythm with my footsteps. Behind me, I could hear the shouts of Fonzie’s men, their voices echoing off the walls of the nearby buildings. I glanced over my shoulder, adrenaline surging through my veins, urging me to run faster.

“Mildred!” I shouted again, but the only response was the distant sound of the city—a cacophony of honking horns and muffled voices. I had to find her, but first, I needed to put some distance between us and Fonzie’s goons.

I darted down an alley, the narrow space flanked by towering brick walls that seemed to close in around me. The shadows felt alive, whispering secrets of danger and urgency. I spotted a door leading to a stairwell and quickly slipped inside, hoping it would lead me to safety.

As I ascended the stairs, I could hear the distant thuds of footsteps behind me, growing closer. I pushed open the door to the rooftop and stepped out into the night, the cool breeze hitting my face like a splash of cold water. The skyline of New York stretched out before me, a sea of lights twinkling like stars on the ground.

I crouched low, scanning the area for any sign of Mildred. I knew I had to find her quickly; Fonzie’s men would be relentless. I took a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart. My mind raced with possibilities. Where could she have gone? Did she manage to escape, or was she still trapped?

I made my way to the edge of the rooftop, peering down into the alley below. I scanned for any movement in the darkness. Just then, I caught a glimpse of her—a flash of her dark coat disappearing around the corner. Relief washed over me, followed quickly by the realization that I needed to reach her before they did.

I turned and sprinted across the rooftop, leaping from one building to the next, the thrill of the chase propelling me forward. I was a shadow among shadows, driven by a singular purpose: to protect Mildred.

As I reached the next rooftop, I heard voices rising from the street below. “Split up! She can’t have gone far!” one of them barked. My stomach dropped. They were close—too close.

I scanned the street, spotting a fire escape that led down to the alley. Without a second thought, I dashed toward it, gripping the cold metal and descending quickly. I landed silently on the ground and peered around, my instincts on high alert.

“Mildred!” I called softly, hoping against hope she would hear me. I was met with silence, the night thick with tension. I moved cautiously, staying close to the walls, listening for any sound that might lead me to her.

Suddenly, I heard a rustling behind a nearby dumpster. My heart raced as I approached, ready for anything. “Mildred?” I whispered again, my voice barely audible.

The dumpster shifted slightly, and she emerged, her face pale but determined. “George!” she gasped, relief flooding her features. “I thought I’d lost you!”

“Not a chance,” I replied, taking her hand. “We need to move. They’re looking for us.”

We turned to leave the alley, but just as we stepped out, we were met with the sight of two of Fonzie’s men blocking our path. Their expressions were cold and menacing, and I could see the glint of weapons in their hands.

“Look what we have here,” one of them sneered, stepping forward. “Thought you could slip away, huh?”

I felt a rush of panic, but I couldn’t let it show. “Mildred, stay behind me,” I whispered, trying to formulate a plan.

“Now, now, let’s not make this difficult,” the second man said, a smirk creeping onto his face. “Just hand over the girl, and we’ll let you walk away.”

“Over my dead body,” I shot back, every ounce of defiance surging through me. I knew I had to buy us time.

Suddenly, a loud noise erupted from behind them—a car engine revving followed by a crash. The two men turned, momentarily distracted. I seized the opportunity, grabbing Mildred's hand and pulling her with me as we dashed down a side street.

“Where are we going?” she asked, her breath coming in quick gasps.

“Anywhere but here,” I replied, glancing back to see if we were being followed. The sounds of chaos echoed behind us, and I hoped whatever diversion had occurred would buy us a little more time.

We turned down another alley, weaving through the maze of buildings. My mind raced, searching for a safe place to hide. Then I spotted a small entrance to a subway station just ahead. “In here!” I urged, pulling her inside.

The station was dimly lit and nearly empty, the air thick with the smell of old metal and lingering grease. We hurried down the stairs to the platform, the distant rumble of an approaching train echoing through the tunnels.

“Do you think they followed us?” Mildred asked, her eyes wide with fear.

“I’m not sure, but we can’t take any chances,” I replied, glancing around. “We need to get on the next train and put some distance between us and them.”

The train rolled in, its lights illuminating the platform. I grabbed her hand and pulled her on board just as the doors slid shut behind us. We found an empty seat in the corner, and I leaned back, trying to steady my breathing.

As the train pulled away from the station, I risked a glance out the window. The city blurred past, a whirlwind of lights and movement. I felt a mix of relief and lingering anxiety; we had escaped, but the danger was far from over.

“Mildred, I need you to tell me everything you know about Fonzie and the artifact,” I said, turning to her. “We can’t outrun this unless we understand what we’re dealing with.”

She nodded, her expression serious. “I overheard him talking about it multiple times. They believe it has some kind of power—something that could change the balance of power in the criminal underworld. I didn’t think it was real until I saw how urgent they were about it.”

“Why would they want you?” I asked, my brow furrowing.

“They think I know where it is,” she replied, her voice trembling slightly. “I don’t, I swear. I just overheard bits and pieces.”

I took her hands in mine, trying to reassure her. “We’ll figure this out together. You’re not alone in this.”

As the train continued to speed through the dark tunnels, I felt the weight of our situation settling over us. We were two people caught in a storm, but I wouldn’t let it consume us. I was determined to uncover the truth behind Fonzie, the artifact, and the shadows that threatened to swallow Mildred whole.

We were in this together, and I would do everything in my power to protect her. But first, we had to find a way to turn the tables on Fonzie before it was too late.",1,1736724329.0,ebooklibri,0,1.0,False

I fell down the rabbit hole of espresso making at home and have spent some time learning how to improve my shots. 

I’m finding myself in a bit of a predicament currently. I work at a restaurant as a barman and am therefore taking care of all coffee related things as well. 
Our current shots are bad to put it simply, it tastes bitter and burnt. As well, the crema isn’t crema, it’s mostly foam that dissolves 20 seconds after the extraction. 

I have had talks with my supplier (taking care of the beans as well as machinery) regarding this problem and his find answer was « grind finer ». It worked a little bit but didn’t answer the actual problems in tastes. 
I then asked him what the temperature of the extraction was and, to my surprise, it happens at 75 degree Celsius ! He claimed having a higher temperature would cause the crema to become foamy and loose texture (which is a current problem already!) 

Now, of all the information I read, watched or was told, we should never go below 90 degrees when extracting coffee with a sweet spot being at around 92-93. Our beans are a dark roast so maybe I should look at like 89-90 but still. 

So my question I guess is: is he a genius and knows things about coffee that I and the majority simply don’t know and there’s an actual benefit to extracting at 75 degrees or is he just wrong in his line of thoughts? 

I’m not trying to make our coffee speciality level, I don’t have the beans for it but I still believe it’s possible to make an alright shot with a few tweaks.

(I need help),"I just want to say at first I tried to convince myself not to post on here, but after reading the heart warming comments on other people’s posts I’d really appreciate some advice. 
I will say, though, this is a really long and deep story, so only read it if you want to. I don’t want to force my trauma on anyone. 

I was in a long-distance relationship with someone I originally met online, roughly 6 or 7 years ago. We were together (as in romantic lovers) for just over a year. 
Before then, we had never met, but were still very close friends online. Before we’d actually met, although we were young and questioning the world, we’d always have insightful conversations about random intellectual topics, such as social issues and commentaries. I’m not even sure why we’d do this, but every time we’d connect it’d be to discuss the world, what’s wrong with it, and our perspectives on it. We’d go months without texting each other, but when we’d end up re-connecting, all the same familiar feelings would return. Whether it was email, WhatsApp, letters, we’d always find a way to connect after a while. 
To be honest, looking back, we did fantasise about getting together, getting married, making beautiful poetic love, but at that age (we were probably about 15-16 and hopeless teenage romantics) we sort of accepted that it’d remain a fantasy. Anyway, we’d update each other about our separate lives, send each other updates in pictures, and we both just really found it refreshing to reconnect. We were really just two people who never really fit into mainstream culture - we didn’t really like the idea of using social media or the culture of internet at all. For this reason, like I said before, we communicated through SMS, or emails. It was just this string of familiarity in someone so far away, yet felt so close.

Untillllll…… we became adults (18), and we decided to finally meet in person. Once we did meet, (I have goosebumps as I’m writing this) man I’m telling you it was like a dream. 
She met me at the train station, and I was greeted with this massive tree-hug. She led me to the hotel id be staying at, and once I checked in, and we went to my room, she physically could not stop smiling. It was so fucking cute but at the time I was also a little concerned. She literally did not stop smiling for the next hour, it was like she’d just taken some crazy drugs. Looking back, I guess she was just so overcome with joy and happiness that her body elicited ak automatic response. How cute is that :,) 

So yeah, We were hugging, kissing holding hands. All the time waiting to finally see the person I knew so well but had never seen in the flesh came upon us, and we were just in this bubble of happiness, warmth and ecstasy for the next three days while I was there. (She lived in a city a couple hundred miles away) 
When the first day was over, she said to me that she genuinely couldn’t believe that I was real. 
On the third day, we had a little coffee date before I got my return train. We were just talking about life, and I think about our opinions on “depression” as a scientific concept against it as a societal construct. Whilst she wa talking I saw that she had a diary in her bag, so I asked her if I could write in it. She seemed quite surprised but pleased, and let me write in it. I wrote a few pages of romantic / poetic affectionate stuff and drew her a rough biro pen picture of some flowers. Before I could show her, I remember her saying that she needed the bathroom and she’d be back in a sec. When she got back, I was pretty sure she’d looked like she’d just been crying, so I moved to her side of the table and cuddled her, and asked her what was wrong. She said to me that she just wants me to know that there’s some very horrible and bad men out there, and that no matter what happens between us, “you really set the bar”. I felt my heart skip a beat when she told me this, and the words didn’t really resonate, but I told her that I’m just being me. I care about her and I’m just treating her how I’d treat someone I deeply care about. Looking back although I don’t cry at all it makes me quite emotional thinking about that moment. 

So yeah, following that first meeting We had a beautiful long - distance relationship. She lived a couple hundred miles away, but we managed to make it work for the year. Whilst at university, I also worked all month, and when I’d get paid at the end of the month I’d use that money to book a hotel for a few days in her city and we’d spend time together every couple months. Everything was perfect. We were in love like a film. She was a v*rgin (completely untouched, without being too crude or sensitive) before we eventually engaged in intercourse, and every time we’d make love it was like a picturesque dream for the both of us. As you have the picture, we were both very very in love. 
There were times she’d cry, out of love for me, as she’d explain that she’d never imagined for there to be a man as good as I was to her, and she was ever grateful that I was in her life. I loved it so much - we’d never go a day without communicating, texting or calling, and she really did love me. It was quite like a renaissance painting, or a Mozart piece; seamless and formed. We weren’t the average couple, we enjoyed making beautiful  poetry, and spent a lot of time doing things like having picnics and walking and talking. Life was just fucking awesome. 

So now the sad bit : in the summer 2024, about a month after we’d last seen each other since, and when we’d just celebrated a year of being together, she’d started having doubts about me, saying that she’d lost feelings and hasn’t felt the same affectionate way she’d usually feel. Bear in mind, we were in a long-distance relationship, so although it was a huge shock to hear, I assumed that the distance was just a bit much for her, so told her I’d come to see her the following week, so we’d be able to have a real conversation in person about how she was currently feeling. To my surprise, as soon as I turned up, and she was in front of me, she immediately said she wanted to apologise, and cried her eyes and heart out. She leant forward and leaned into me, crying into my shoulder and repeatedly saying sorry. She said that, although she wasn’t sure what the future would bring, she was sure that in the present moment she wanted me, and knew that for a fact. Alas, the next few days we spent rekindling our love, and she’d constantly tell me how happy she is that we’re together. She was to start university in the coming September x and we looked into the universities she’d wanted to go to together. 
Eventually, we found one, and although it was very far away from where I am studying, we were just happy that we were successful in getting her a place. 
She was evermost grateful that I was there, and kept saying to me that if I wasn’t there, she wasn’t sure how she’d have gotten into university at all, due to how upset she was after finding out her grades. When I left to go back home, she messaged me and said she was ever so grateful for the patience I showed, and was so grateful for our relationship. It honestly felt like we were back to normal again- our normal being this poetic and beautiful love that we both connected to each other through. Fast forward 2 weeks, she moves away to university. I move back to university too, far away though from her, where I study medicine. 
The first week of her moving in, she doesn’t respond to many of my messages nor call me at all, but I didn’t think much of it because I’d thought I’d give her time to settle in. After the second week, she’d still continued to ignore me, so I called her a few times, as I was now quite worried. She didn’t answer, but she eventually texted me back, after I’d text her all night. She said she just needed to have a think, and was on a walk. After not speaking to me for so long I was so confused why her first message was this, so as her worried boyfriend I continued to call her. She answered on the 6th attempt, and simply just said to me that she’d met someone at university, and it was something she’d really want to pursue. Upon hearing this I was in a shock, and said something like “good luck to you both” and hung up the phone. After a couple hours I did call her back, because I needed a full explanation and some closure about this situation. Just over 2 weeks ago, we’d met and were making love, and she was telling me how much she loved and cherished me. Now she was saying she’d met someone else within a week of moving to university. During the phone call she was very brash and dismissive, and pretty much just said to me that he was her flatmate and that she was attracted to him and was no longer attracted to me anymore. She said she’d spent some time getting to know him and his background and felt an immense feeling towards him and wanted to pursue it. She said a few times that she doesn’t love me anymore and upon asking her if she was certain she said she was certain. I was sure that if I got to see her another time she’d change her mind but she said to me that this time was different, and that she was “changing”. She said she was “growing”, and was “out into the world now” and just wanted to “be”. I wasn’t sure at all what any of this meant but I just had to accept it. I wished her luck, and she’d said she wanted to lose my phone number, and asked if this was okay. I wasn’t sure at all why she’d do this, but I said it’s up to her. This happened over a month ago, and it’s since been my birthday, and also hers. I’m 20 now, and she’s 19. I feel very sad about it all, and can’t stop thinking about the beautiful times we’d shared, and how she’d stepped out so suddenly. 
Because of the sheer nature of our relationship, I have a feeling that she’ll end up feeling regretful, and reaching out eventually. But part of me also thinks that that is wishful thinking. Since the phone conversation she’s not spoken to me at all, and many thoughts raced my mind the weeks after the break up -  Why would it take a week of moving out to destroy a beautiful and wonderful relationship - one we had since we were children? What’s this matter about “growing” and being “out into the world”?  At the time I thought she’d made a very impulsive choice. But now, I have had a few months to reflect, and I’ll cite my reflections below:

I still think about us a lot. Notably, none of it is sexual, either. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever thought of her in that sort of way since she broke up with me, nor is it that l that my mind misses and yearns for. Instead, constantly think about the pleasant times we’d had, the laughs, the giggles, calling her every day after boxing training to tell her how it went. 
Sending her my fights, eagerly waiting to tell her that I’d won / lamenting to her when I’d lose. 
I can see why she did it. She’s 300+ miles away now, at the other side of the country. I’m doing a 5-year medical degree. Time just won’t help us progress together. She wants to explore the world and what’s in it, and I’m nobody to take that away from her at all. At the end of the day, we are still SO young, I do see that. But at the same time, we had such a wonderful relationship. 
Sometimes I question me, myself. What’s wrong with me that she doesn’t love me anymore? Is it me? Am I just ugly now that she’s seen other men? Surely not, she’s more insightful than that. But why? I’m a boxer, I’ve come up from poverty and now I’m going to be a doctor. Surely she would want such a man? 
Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had ample opportunity to pursue other people, but my mind repels me from it. 
I don’t know what to do, and sometimes I want to call her to reconnect, other times I think to leave it and to let her live her life and get her degree. 
Should I make contact? Maybe she regrets it now? Will she regret it guys? 

If you’ve made it to the end of this, I just want to say a massive thank you. Even if you don’t reply I don’t mind, it shows you must really care. 
Like I said I was never gonna even bother writing a Reddit post, but I re read some of the poetry I wrote for her and it sent my mind back to the lamenting mode.

But do you guys think she’ll eventually regret it? 
Will I be able to move on? Does it get easier?",1,1736723304.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I feel like as soon I try to know them better, they just stop answering or ghost because I think they are there for sex, validation and ego boost too, and when I'm direct at the point, they just accept.

1hzzntj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hzzntj/help_my_best_friend_is_going_to_get_engaged_to_a/,Help! My best friend is going to get engaged to a villain and there's literally nothing I can do about it,"Hi Charlotte love you! Also I'm so sorry this will be quite long, and English is my second language so I apologize for any errors in advance! 

I've known my best friend, ""Mila"" (27f) since we were 12 years old and met as two awkward girls in the same middle school history class. We got along great because we were the only two kids in our grade who both were children of immigrants and the first generation growing up in the US. We were also the only two kids in our grade who still liked playing with dolls and playing dress up, and we still do to this day! Eventually we even started working at a toy company together in different departments, though we've both since left the company. Though we had very similar backgrounds, We also had very different ones. She was raised as Orthodox Jewish and I was raised Christian/Catholic. This will be kind of important later. 

When we were in our last few years of high school, she and I decided to do some shopping and we split off from each other to find what we were looking for. While I'm looking around I see this absolutely hopeless man with a friend trying to pick out an item but not being able to discern which one would be best. I'm a nice person sometimes and I decided to chime in and give the poor boy some help. He thanked me and we got to chatting, he told me his name was ""Richard"" and he was shopping around trying to find something for his girlfriend. We walk around together for a little bit and run into Mila, who also seems to have made a new friend who actually came to the store with Richard. The four of us get to talking and we all exchange phone numbers so we can catch up and get together at some point. Now I told Richard that I specialize in a specific field of art (won't disclose what it is for anonymity), But basically Richard wanted to commission me. I said ""Sure, absolutely! Tell me what pieces that you would like and we can talk about a budget and pricing so we can still get you a piece you like without breaking the bank."" Richard then tells me that he works in a very specific line of work that he won't disclose. I don't care what my clients do for work so I don't ask. But he seemed almost pushy about it, like he really wanted me to ask and ask how much money he had in the bank. I thought it was weird but I didn't really care too much. Ultimately he tells me that he is actually a self-made millionaire. Which, cool I guess, good for you, but I don't see what that has to do with you commissioning me for an art piece. Eventually he just stops texting me and I never get the bag on that commission.

I almost forget about him until a couple years later after Mila and I have graduated from high school. Remember that friend that she made in the store? Well apparently Mila had been keeping in touch with her over all this time, and had hung out with her and Richard a lot since then. I thought it was weird at the time that she didn't tell me but it's her life so who cares? Well I should have been keeping a closer eye on her because next thing I know she's dating Richard. At first I thought this was super weird, because Richard is a total Playboy type. So wildly different from any guy she's ever dated before, and he lives 2 hours away in a sketchy part of town. I tell her to be careful, But she just kind of brushes me off. 

Fast forward to 2 years later. I had just moved back to town after going through the worst breakup I've ever had. Mila and I continued to talk every single day over the course of those two years. She is my rock, and I love her so much for supporting me through everything. Mila had also just returned back to town after visiting some family abroad and we meet for coffee. This ""besties-coffee-date"" will be cemented in my head for the rest of my life. Mila lets me know that she's been keeping a huge secret from me, that she's been leading a double life. Without going too into it, Richard had cheated on her over a year ago, and they had officially broken up that day. But the very next day, Richard had called Mila asking her to come over. They hooked up and Mila ended up being effectively the other woman in her own relationship. Richard continued dating the other woman he had cheated on her with, But also continued dating Mila. This went on for a year and a half. So why was Mila telling me about this now? Richard's girlfriend found out and effectively broke them up as soon as she got back from visiting her family. Mila was a mess, I was a mess, and I couldn't believe that someone could do something so terrible to my best friend by leading her on and making her think that at the end of the day he was going to pick her. Mila hasn't had very much dating experience so she literally had no defenses against anything like this happening to her. I cried for my best friend because this was something I know she would never willingly participate in. But thankfully, she would never have to see him again. 

Fast forward 6 months or so and I start to notice Mila becoming a little bit more distant. I reach out to our mutual best friend and he tells me that Mila and Richard have started going out on dates again. I confront her about this, and she tells me that she feels like she is healed enough to get back together with him after all the work she's been doing in therapy since the breakup. My immediate question was if he was still dating the other girl. She said he wasn't, however, she was still living in his house!! He even reached out to me for legal advice to get his ex girlfriend evicted.

Needless to say I did not feel good about this, But I know my best friend and I knew there was nothing I could say that could change her mind. I told her to be careful, and to be fair, she was. They had a set of rules that each of them would follow, regular check-ins, and he had to promise that he would go to therapy himself. Which he did, but I have no idea how long that commitment went on for. Of course, as the protective, scary dog, best friend, I straight up told Richard that if he ever hurt her again I would burn his house down so he better up his insurance. 

Almost 5 years have passed now, and they are still together. She moved with in with him over a year ago now and things seem to be smooth sailing. I will admit that seeing Richard put in the work to become a better person and partner for her has made me tolerate him a little bit more. But he still has a lot of work to do in my opinion. I can give him the respect I would give to any other random person. I've never been outright mean to him. A couple years ago, Mila and Richard were talking about marriage. At first I will admit, I was excited at this! I had seen Richard put in the work, Mila had grown as a person, and I was so proud of them. Richard started asking me what kind of rings Mila would like and to figure out what her ring size is. Of course I sent him everything he needed to know, specifications, preferences, what diamond cut she liked most, etc. And then: crickets. 

I had figured that Richard had purchased a ring during this time, and that he was going to pop the question any day. They kept taking lavish trips together, and he even took her to one of the best restaurants in the world. I was so certain that he was going to propose during this dinner. But lo and behold, this Man posted on his Snapchat story a picture of his food only with the caption ""Happy birthday to me."" Where she had a lot of posts of the two of them together, he only posted pictures of the food. This ticked me off, because how are you going to take your girlfriend to the most expensive and high class restaurants in the world and not propose to her there? I started realizing a trend around this time, that Richard does not know how to do something nice just for her. The restaurant was for him and she was his accessory. They went on a trip to Disney where she wanted to take a bunch of cute pictures together, But he instead decided to do something absolutely ridiculous with his hair that made him look beyond stupid so Mila literally had no pictures from that trip. Any vacation they went on was for him, and he'd invite Mila along for the ride. She was always an afterthought. 

Eventually he started sending me messages randomly, making it sound like he had already proposed to her but whenever I'd message her asking, she would say no with a laughing emoji. At this point I know she's getting mad, they had been through so much together and the fact that he hadn't put a ring on her finger yet was irritating the both of us. Now flashback to the last Rosh Hashanah dinner at her family's house. Her family loves Richard, But mostly because he's willing to convert to Orthodox Judaisim for her. At this dinner, like all of the Jewish holiday dinners I attend (literally every holiday, every chance I get, give me that challah bread!), I decide it's time to play my favorite game. The ""let's bully Richard into proposing soon"" game. At this point I'm engaged, and getting married in 2025. I tell Richard ""you know what the best wedding present you can get for me is? Seeing my best friend engaged to someone she loves with all her heart. Knowing that my best friend is going to be happy and excited for my wedding day, but also being excited for hers"". Richard scoffed at this, and instead decided it would be a great time for a joke, ""actually, I think what I'm going to do is propose right in the middle of your best man speech at your wedding"". This lit a little fire inside of me. Although I know Mila will smack the crap out of him before he gets the chance, It is absolutely on brand for him to do something like this. In between courses during this dinner, Richard pulls me aside. And he tells me he is going to be proposing in March while they are on a trip visiting her family. In my mind that is the perfect proposal for her! She is very family-centered, and I know just how special it would be for her to have her family in attendance. I tell him good job and to let me know if he needs any help whatsoever. 

Fast forward to this week. Mila and I are FaceTiming and she asks me to text Richard and see if he actually has a ring yet. It's currently January and he wants to propose in March, and he started telling her family this as well. I figure who can it hurt, he probably already has a ring as I gave him everything he needed to know two years ago. I text him asking for a picture of the ring, and he tells me that the trip is still so far away so he doesn't need to worry about getting a ring yet. I immediately go into panic mode. I let him know how long it can actually take to get an engagement ring, especially if he wants to get her a real diamond, which he's always expressed he wanted to do, and a big one at that. He immediately starts asking me for all of the information all over again because ""he lost it"" and then starts bouncing some proposal ideas off me. He decides now, that he wants to change when he's proposing to before the trip. I say ""okaaay so what were you thinking?"" And he tells me about how he wants to propose to her ON HIS BIRTHDAY by telling her, ""the only thing I want for my birthday is for you to be my wife"" which, cute I guess, but DEFINITELY NOT FOR HER. I shoot it down, and I give him a play-by-play of what would be the most perfect proposal for her, while keeping it as low maintenance for this dummy as possible. And he says he's absolutely going to do it. And two days later I'm on standby on the phone with him for over 4 hours going to different jewelry stores with him virtually as I'm at work. He decides he wants to get her a ring that's custom which will take more time, and he can't nail down which cut and how many carats he wants to get her. He also starts talking about proposing to her on his birthday again. I tell him no and then get back to business. I give him all of my advice, opinions, talking to the jewelers directly, etc, but when he was oscillating between two stones after 3.5 hours, My brain was kind of fried and I said ""look dude, it's really up to you how much you want to spend. I know she doesn't care what size rock she gets, this is all your choice now"" he immediately got annoyed, said I was ""no help whatsoever"" and hung up on me. Several days pass and he calls me letting me know that he picked out a ring but he's still trying to decide between 3 different cuts for the diamond in the middle. I say sounds great let me know which one you pick and out of curiosity I ask the cost of the ring. Guys. The ring is $45k. My jaw immediately dropped, I told him he should probably keep looking and to not buy her a ring so expensive and then explain that I'm planning my wedding for 100 people, I'm DIYing everything, and our cost is still coming to around $25k. And if he wants to have a little extra play money for the wedding he should probably get a less expensive ring. (Also Mila will probably have a panic attack anytime that ring snags on anything.)That's when Richard completely caught me off guard by saying ""well, we're not having a wedding so it doesn't matter how much I spend on the ring"". I'm sorry what? I know for a fact that my best friend wants a big wedding with all of her family and loved ones there, Wedding under the chuppah, stomping on glass, the works. I know her dream for a wedding with such depth that in high school I started accumulating a binder full of everything she needs to plan her dream wedding. Her wedding is basically already planned, All we need is the checkbook and the rock. Both Richard and Mila are aware of this binder. I explain to him that I know exactly what she wants for a wedding and that she's getting one, whether he likes it or not. My best friend will not be compromising her dreams for him. He proceeds to tell me how he wouldn't even have that many people to invite, only two people, his best friend and his grandma. I try to relate by saying I understand that thought process because when I first started planning a wedding I didn't think I had that many people, But the more I started guest planning, the more I wanted certain people to be there for what will be the happiest day of my life. 

Guys, he said the following: ""what you you mean? My wedding isn't going to be the best day of my life. Why would it be?"" 

I immediately started feeling nauseous and breaking into a cold sweat. My heart sank. I asked him to clarify and to tread fucking lightly because this is my best friend we're talking about. I said, ""I'm sorry, marrying your wife, your partner until the day you die, /isn't/ going to be the best day of your life?"". And boy did he clarify. He said ""Im just a very materialistic guy, honestly I'd rather spend $3,000 on a new flat screen TV then spend that on a wedding. Plus I'm spending $45K on a ring so she can't really complain."" 

At this point, two things were made abundantly clear to me: One, Richard was buying her the ring to shut her up about getting married. Two, he was going into this marriage with the notion that marriage only lasts as long as someone doesn't file for divorce. Basically, I thought I was going to throw up, I told him I had to get back to work so we ended the call and I immediately broke down crying in my office. My best friend is one of the sweetest, kindest, most loving people on the planet. She's been there for me and more ways than I can count, and I thoroughly believe she deserves the world. After all the hell this man put her through, years of him putting her through stress after stress, home improvement projects, evicting his ex from HER NOW HOME, the cheating, etc. She /deserves/ to be happy after all that! I 911 called a mutual friend who also understands the whole situation and he told me not to say anything, or else we both will be cut out of her life like Emily. The rest of our friend group agrees, Even though we all share the same disdain for Richard. 

A few months ago Mila shared the cheating story with another friend of ours, Emily. She immediately had a new disdain for Richard, but she grinned and bared it. That is until one day she wore a backless top and apparently Richard's hands lingered during a hug goodbye. Emily immediately spoke up to Mila about this, and tried laying out some new boundaries so that their friendship could continue, just without the mention of Richard. Mila slowly started cutting off contact with Emily, now they don't talk unless it's about the book series that they're both currently reading. 

My heart is breaking for my best friend. I know there's literally nothing I can do to talk her out of saying yes to marrying him, and all I can do is just sit here and watch as my best friend marries the wrong person. But every part of me wants to tell her what Richard told me on the phone. I was in a bad relationship before and I'm seeing a lot of the same red flags in Richard that I saw in my ex. Am I being petty? Am I losing it? Am I imagining and projecting things? Am I overprotective of my best friend? Yes, absolutely, I'm well aware. I just want her to be happy and live her dream of starting a happy family with the man of her dreams, especially since I found the man of mine. Please help me Charlotte, I feel like I'm losing my mind. ",2,1736722983.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

We've been delighted that he seems to not dislike his crate and, aside from a bit of quiet grumbling early on, sleeps through the night in it. (We don't crate him otherwise.)

We're starting to work on giving him the confidence to be alone. I rushed things a few days ago and thought I could step out for ten minutes to get coffee. Despite him being otherwise completely housetrained, I came back to a huge pee spot on a rug.

Today we put him in his crate with a lick mat, set up a camera outside the door (unfortunately it's a bit dark in the bedroom where his crate is, and the camera I currently have shines a harsh light when recording), and drove around the neighborhood for a few minutes. He didn't seem \*too\* panicked, but was definitely barking. When we got back we didn't make a big deal out of it and neither did he. In fact, while my partner was checking his crate for any pee (there was none), he tried to go back in. That's a good sign, right?

Is there any danger, though, of further separation training giving him negative associations with being in his crate at night? We're thinking of doing it one more time today.",1,1736722742.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

The speaker had given us a full 2 day agenda, all of which happened inside this one meeting room. 

About 10 or so minutes in while eating breakfast I got a waft of a smell from someone, it was bad body odor. It then went and I carried on doing what I was doing. During the next hour it started to get worse, I could pinpoint it to one guy in particular because every time he passed it would follow him. Everytime we got split into groups and he moved around it would get worse, as if moving awakened it again. 

By lunchtime the room was absolutely reeking of BO. It was in my nostrils no matter how much I tried to subtly cover my nose. The room’s air felt thick somehow. I could see people twitching their noses or making faces but nobody said anything. Then it got so bad people were opening windows and it was freezing cold, but enduring the cold was so much easier than the smell. People were also wandering out during the talks and tasks to take toilet breaks, to get water, or to “get some air”. I could feel my eyes watering, I felt sick.

It was as that point I knew I had to tell him, I couldn’t pull him aside as people would hear me do it. Small room, 15 or so people. I waited for him to get up for a toilet/water/coffee/whatever break and followed him out. I quietly told him maybe he forgot his deodorant as it was hot in that room and a bit sweaty and sometimes guys can sweat a bit more (not fact, I have no idea, I was just awkwardly rambling). I tried to be as kind about it as possible.

Then he says “Uh… no? I smell fine. You are the only one who can smell something so it must be you.” Then laughed and went back into the room, smell trailing back behind him.

I just needed to share that.

My entire life, I have felt twitching everywhere on my body. And I mean everywhereeeee. Common places like arms, legs, eyelids, but I also get them on my tongue, cheeks, inside my ear drum, side of my head and temples, my butt, my abs, my chest, my neck, etc. Every single place that has a muscle, I have felt twitching.

They're never accompanied with pain or stiffness, nor were they caused by an accident or illness. I even saw a specialist when I was a young teenager and her response was, ""sometimes people just get these. No biggie."" 

I started drinking caffeine in my late 20s, now I'm hooked on coffee, and I'm well aware that I'm likely low on magnesium and electrolytes, which I know causes increased twitching. I drink plenty of water! But I'm sure I'm lacking on important nutrients.

I wanted to write this post to see if there are others within this community that have also dealt with life-long twitching? No pain, no problems swallowing, no health concerns, just muscle spasms.",2,1736722644.0,BFS,2,1.0,False

Hope this isn't asking too much but I always wanted to try the steam deck out, before I think about buying one.

This is on a throw away account cause the fear of him finding this out before I personally get to tell him ways on me. 

I 22 (F) lesbian have a best friend named “Ryan”. Ryan and I have been friends since high school , we are very close, we tell each others our deep secrets and overall have a great time together. He works at a cafe where he met “Alice” they began to work with eachother and hangout after work. Alice is very religious, goes to Sunday church and reads the Bible, is pretty close with her pastor just overall very into organized religion. Ryan believes in god but does not like organized religion, at least recently. In the past, he has always said he was an atheist and that the Bible was misogynistic, homophobic, and sexist. I’m perfectly chill with people who believe in god and respect peoples religious beliefs. The sudden change to being an atheist and going to church on Sunday for some girl is the baffling part. 

A month ago they get into a religious debate about how Adam and Eve is a metaphor, this leads to him asking her if she likes gay people, her answer was along the lines that she does not accept them and thinks it’s a sin, things switch over to a political topic , she then admits she voted for trump, Ryan is very far left and was upset with what she was saying, Ryan has a trans sister for more info. He tells her he no longer wants to be associated with her. A few days later she tells him she is trying to accept the homosexual life style. He forgives her. I’ve had trouble with her previously, we went out for bowling and every time my girlfriend called she seem visually annoyed which was only twice through out the night, I noticed her saying things under her breath which I couldn’t hear. I was angry with her behavior and expressed that to Ryan which he then told her what I said. Alice and I have never talked about it because Ryan cleared up the air leaving me feeling very awkward about the situation. 


They start to “date” she has trouble with that word and to this day I don’t think they are officially dating because he isn’t Christian. whatever they are, I’m just glad Ryan has someone who treats him well until she starts acting weird.

We were all over Ryan’s house a group hang sesh, dinner cooking we (my girlfriend 23 F) were upstairs in his room with Alice while Ryan was cooking. My girlfriend Julie says “omg that is so gay” to a gift that Alice bought Ryan, Julie said it in a very exciting and cutesy way because the gift was in relation to one of her hobbies. Alice says “hey, don’t say that it’s not gay I bought that for him.” Julie proceeds to say “what I think this is really cool, you’re the one using gay in a negative way.” It was a very awkward moment and I had nothing to say because I don’t like confrontation and it drops and the day moves on.
(Disclaimer I don’t really think this situation was terrible just very awkward and off putting)

Yesterday my girlfriend and I went to visit the coffee shop they work at, both of them present we are about to head out when she says “guys I’m reading a lesbian book” my brain jumps for joy. We ask her about the book and she tells us the title is “gay girl, good god” a biography. she then proceeds to say that she’s been waiting to read it for years. The title didn’t shake me I thought it would’ve been an inclusive look behind gay Christian’s, until she said that the woman who wrote it ended up with a man. Julie and I looked at each other shocked. I then said “oh I don’t want to read that, out the window for me” Alice then said “I figured you guys wouldn’t be interested in it” throughout the conversation she implied that we should read it. We eventually left, Julie and I talked about it in the car and dug deep on what the book was about, I suggest looking up the book for better context. Basically, the book is an autobiography about how this woman found god and cured her homosexuality. We are both left conflicted on whether or not we should tell him how we truly feel. I feel a bit taken back by Ryan, I feel like he’s ignoring (in my eyes) red flags for this girl who he thinks he can change, vice versa because I truly believes she thinks she can change him too. It feels like a slap in the face, it’s very uncomfortable to be around her. What are your thoughts?",1,1736722543.0,Advice,3,1.0,False
