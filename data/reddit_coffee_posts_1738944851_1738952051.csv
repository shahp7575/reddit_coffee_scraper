I created a few when I had a resin printer, but I'm going a different route this time.  Over the holidays I collected some junk, broken items, or curb side alerts.  I don't have all the tools like a drill press, bandsaw, lathe, or other cool stuff.  I'm working with all the pieces I took from this junk to make my own.  Like, if I was some poor force wielder that found a book about Lightsabers and how to build them, and I just so happened to have found a Kyber crystal.  Maybe the outer rim planet is a mix of Corellia and Jakku.  Anyway, here is the list of stuff I destroyed to get the parts I have.  Everything was free

Now I‚Äôm grown up and I think middle class. I was able to buy a small house for myself and I have expendable income. Anyway somehow my social circle is made up of people whose parents were medical doctors, university professors, that kind of thing.

First I made some coffee in a a French press. Ground some beans finely and then poured boiling water into the French press before putting the lid on. Once it brewed, push the plunger down and let stand for a few minutes.

I heated a small amount of macadamia milk on the stove in a double boiler and added a small amount of pistachio syrup to taste as a sweetener. Once it was almost boiling I made a cup of coffee. 

I then had the BRILLIANT(??) idea to make a matcha foam to go on top. Grabbed some matcha powder and started another double boiler of macadamia milk. Followed the same steps minus the pistachio, and then fluffed up the Mac-milk with a stirring whisk thing. 

I then put the coffee over ice and poured the foam on top.

I‚Äôm tired of life. I struggled in school as a kid, I was put in special ed because I couldn‚Äôt pay attention in class, I lagged behind all the other stupids and struggled to catch up. After high school I went to community college and that was the best time of my life. I had more friends than I could count. I did work at several different jobs like restaurants, coffee shops and a movie theater. Every one of those places I made friends and would kick it at their places or my place all the time.

Then the crash of 2008 happened. I was living with my parents and worked two part time jobs, and I was still struggling yet I didn‚Äôt even have to pay rent. I made the mistake of joining the Marines. You want to talk about an introvert‚Äôs nightmare? Imagine being around the most extroverted and narcissistic people imaginable. I was kicked out of the Marines for getting in trouble too much. Constantly I was at the mental health clinic because I couldn‚Äôt take the harassment every day from everyone. 

After that I moved back in with my family and felt like a failure. I worked odd jobs here and there, and still got fired from them because I can‚Äôt keep it together. Then I became an uber driver and it was a blessing. I could make my own hours and I would just talk minimally to customers. While being an uber driver I was going to school to become an HVAC technician. Man, talk about a great introvert job. I do commercial work and fix heating and air conditioning on commercial buildings. I‚Äôm completely by myself 99% of the time. The only times I talk to people are checking in and out with the customer or staff at a building. I might see my boss once a month. The biggest problems I face are driving complaints from Karens on the road or if I screw up on trying to fix something. 

Been doing this job for 8 years now and I think the reason why I‚Äôve been able to do well in it is because there‚Äôs little human interaction. I don‚Äôt have anyone to throw me under the bus or cause trouble. All throughout my life, OTHER PEOPLE have always been my downfall. Whether they tell lies about me, make exaggerated claims or just talk shit. People in workplaces can be tribal and toxic. But with this job, I‚Äôm on my own and don‚Äôt have to deal with drama. Guaranteed, if I had to work in an office or around other people, I‚Äôd be fired really quick because that‚Äôs how petty other people are. If you‚Äôre different or just want to do your job and mind your own business, they want to ruin you and they keep the magnifying glass on you at all times waiting for you to mess up and holler at the boss and rat you out or throw you under the bus.

Because of dealing with people like this throughout my life, I hate people. There are more villains out there than heroes. Everyone is out to get you. And if you don‚Äôt fit in with the tribe they want to destroy you and oust you. ",1,1738951679.0,introvert,0,1.0,False

1ik1emc,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ik1emc/exmo_testimony_meeting/,Ex-mo testimony meeting,"Good morning sisters, brother, and all of my non-binary siblings,

As I've been considering the opportunity of opening up this ex-mormon tesimony meeting, I'll be honest, I've had a bit of imposter syndrome. Me? A *woman*? No one has invited me to conduct this meeting. I haven't been set apart with any special powers. I've never even had a penis!

That said, I feel honored to be a part of this reddit family‚Äîto be part of a community in which my voice is valued just as much as my husband's, or any miscellaneous 12-year old boy's. But, I cannot deny the prompting to share what I know.

I know that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is categorically untrue. I know it beyond a shadow of a doubt. I know it the same way I know the sun will rise tomorrow: with logic. Because, as the song says, üéµ ~~faith~~ **inductive reasoning** is knowing the sun will rise, brighten each new day. üéµ  
  
I always had a lot of questions as a kid. Unfortunately instead of being supported in my curiousity, I was taught how to build a very sturdy shelf. Over the past few years, using my god-given intellect and free will, I've studied, pondered and meditated on the church's truth claims. Each item I studied was added to my shelf, testing its strength.

I decided to put the church's teachings to the test. I stopped paying my tithing. Things were a bit tight financially, and I was worried that the windows of heaven might close. Imagine my surprise when, almost immediately after I stopped paying a 10% tithe, I had a client reach out and inform me that I had failed to invoice them the year before! I had completely forgotten about this work and wasn't expecting to be paid since to much time had passed, but they graciously paid the over four-thousand dollar bill. Wow, talk about a testimony breaking experience!

The next commandment I decided to break was the Word of Wisdom. I tried coffee. One morning I went to Starbucks and told the barista that I was having a really bad day and asked if she could help me order. She responded with such Christlike love and compassion, helped me order, and asked if my next few days were going to be better. She brightened up my whole morning. The caffeine also helped. Now, I break the Word of Wisdom most days and, without fail, it makes my day better. I'm a better mom when I make it a priority to get some 'me' time and drink a cup of the devil's bean juice in the morning.

I can say for certain that in the past six months since officially leaving the church, I have become a better, kinder, more Christlike person. I pay much less attention to the way people look and much more attention to the way they treat other people‚Äîespecially the vulnerable and those closest to them. I appreciate nature and all of God's creations more. I spend more time doing meaningful service, like providing meals to people struggling with homelessness. I've connected with old friends on a deeper level and made new friends with people I would have previously judged. I'm happier. People have noticed a difference in my countenance. They say I have a light in my eyes.

It's been a really difficult journey out of the church. Most of my family has been extremely unsupportive  and it's hurt relationships that I value dearly. It's been really hard. Despite the struggles, I feel really grateful to have found the truth so that now I can teach it to my children. I feel so grateful to be able to teach them not just truth, but also how to discern truth from error.

I still have challenges, like we all do. But I testify to all of you that, I know that the church is false. I know that Joseph Smith was a pedophile and con man. I know the Russell Marion Nelson does not speak to God. I know that the apostles are not prophets, seers and revelators. They are (somewhat) learned men who think they are wise. They are the ones Jesus warned us about, the ""false prophets who come to us in sheeps clothing, but inwardly...are ravenous wolves."" I've seen the fruit of the gospel they preach and it is bitter.

I love you all so much, even the ones I haven't had the chance to officially meet yet, and I say all of these things, in the name of myself...because I'm the one saying them. Amen.",2,1738951591.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False

Learned a lot last year with my first garden in 15 years. I had some great successes last year and a few failures. A natural part of the process when starting a garden from scratch in dirt I‚Äôm not familiar with. 

I know it had a calcium deficiency. I remedied that by buying bags of crushed shells and my local diner happily provided me eggs shells. I put both on the dirt last fall along with cow manure, mushroom compost and the ashes from last years plants I burned directly in the garden. 

The last component I have is two 27 gallon totes of coffee grounds I acquired . After the weather breaks I plant on tilling everything in thoroughly. However, I know that everything else I used is safe, I know certain things don‚Äôt like coffee grounds. 

Before I finish my layout I want to have this consideration figured out. I‚Äôm hoping to not have this years garden become another learning experience. Thank you in advance!üôÇ

1ik1dww,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ik1dww/shorterterm_relationship_ended_because_of_me/,Shorter-term relationship ended because of me,"I (21M) started going out with this girl (20F) last July and we were official in September. The first week of January she broke up with me. 

I say we had a lot of the same visions for the future and ideas of things. Similar interests. She was really into singing and dancing and I was kind of iffy about doing those things myself. We both worked full-time, I was going to school part-time, and we lived an hour apart. I‚Äôd go to see her on the weekend and she‚Äôd come over to see me at the start of the week. We had a conversation where she felt she wanted to see me more. I felt like I was pretty busy with school work and we agreed to do like 3 days a week. Basically just adding another day in the week for us to meet for dinner. In reality, I probably could‚Äôve met her more but I‚Äôm really bad at procrastinating with homework. 

She‚Äôd call me every night we weren‚Äôt together and we‚Äôd be on the phone for hours up until she fell asleep and then I‚Äôd hang up the call. I was getting tired and started to not like calling because I was usually working on something or playing a game with a friend once in a while. I never said anything because I didn‚Äôt want to upset her. I definitely feel at this point that I could‚Äôve gone to see her more so then we wouldn‚Äôt be calling eachother. 

One night on a call, she said it seemed like I didn‚Äôt care. I did care and would listen to her. But I never really had questions I could think of asking her and I‚Äôm still not very good at active-listening. So I didn‚Äôt have a lot of responses to when she‚Äôd talk about her hard day at work or her talking about her traumatic past with her mom. I realize now that I should‚Äôve tried harder to make her feel like she was being heard and emphasized with. 

She talked to me about how she‚Äôd just zone out a lot and sit in her bed when she‚Äôd get home from work until we‚Äôd call. She‚Äôd sometimes sit and pick at her face or skin for hours too. She didn‚Äôt really have hobbies or friends she liked to go hang out with besides one she‚Äôd get coffee with one day a week. But she didn‚Äôt really like that friend. She didn‚Äôt seem to interest when I was trying to find some hobbies for her to try. She started sketching a picture of my dog but never finished it. She would consistently be late for work too, which is whatever. She also didn‚Äôt really like her work because the people wouldn‚Äôt help her out with stuff and her boss was verbally harassing her in a sexual way.

A few days before the breakup, I was helping a friend put up some sheet metal. When I was done, I asked if she ate anything that day. She didn‚Äôt and so I drove over to her house and took her to get food. We watched a movie and ended up doing stuff. She seemed down after the fact and asked if that‚Äôs all I came over for. I told her that I came over to see her and get some food with her but I dont think she believed me. I will be honest and say I had a hard time keeping my hands off her once we got back to her house. 

She came over to breakup with me and she told me that she was hurting and didn‚Äôt want to hurt me. She admired a lot of my qualities and would miss me. She didn‚Äôt feel like herself anymore. She also said that she felt her and I talked about everything we needed to. We cuddled for most of the 3 hours she was over for that but she had an event to go to and I made sure she left on time. I felt like I didn‚Äôt say a lot to her. 

A few days after I let her know I was thinking about her and that I understand if she needs to work some things out or if a relationship isn‚Äôt the best thing rn. And that I‚Äôm here if she needs to talk to someone. They thanked me for the message and for our time together. Hopes that I have a good semester and that I am successful and happy. I thanked her and told her I enjoyed our time together. I agreed with her decision to breakup because it opened my eyes to how emotionally unavailable I was towards her. I said that hopefully we can both take this time to grow as individuals. I told her that I hope she can move past all this. I mentioned too that I would be seeking therapy to work on some of my issues. Told her she‚Äôs an amazing person and wished her well. She said she enjoyed our time together as well, apologized for not always communicating as effectively as she could‚Äôve and said she‚Äôs proud of me for prioritizing myself and getting therapy. She thanked me. I didn‚Äôt respond because it felt like I shouldn‚Äôt have.

It‚Äôs been 3 weeks since we last texted, almost 4 since the breakup. This week, she unadded me on Snapchat and then a few days later removed me on Insta and Facebook. I had her added on all of those but unadded her on everything once I saw that. 

I think she needed a lot more reassurance, encouragement, and interest from me than I was giving her. I probably made her feel alone. Her birthday is coming up at the end of the month and I probably won‚Äôt text her just so I don‚Äôt ruin her day. We were only together for 7 months, 5 months of official dating.

I had a lot of fun with her but I don‚Äôt think I gave her that deeper connection she wanted. I‚Äôd love to figure out how to love like that but it‚Äôs difficult for me. I wasn‚Äôt socialized very well growing up and my parents were constantly yelling at eachother and me. Ik that‚Äôs not a good excuse because I‚Äôm my own person. 

I‚Äôd love to eventually reconnect with her. Definitely at least to apologize for the specific actions I did or didn‚Äôt do to make her feel alone and not like herself. I don‚Äôt know that she‚Äôd want to talk to me but I feel like I can do better for her. I miss her and I took her for granted",1,1738951544.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Lately I applied for a Fact Checking role at a digital media company ‚Äî think something like Buzzfeed. I thought my skills could be useful since I know how to produce concise, informative texts.

I am not frustrated and actually did not expect to get the job, but I do wish I could understand what I did wrong in order to grow. Looking back, I think I tried too hard to verify the veracity of the facts and did not pay attention to creating a SEO friendly text.

Your goal? **Dominate priority fights and secure the bag.**

‚ö° **Scenario Setup:**

**Congrats, you passed the bar!** üéâ Now, you‚Äôre **fresh into your first big-boy lawyer job** in Chase Bank‚Äôs legal department, and **they‚Äôve thrown you straight into the fire**.

Your **first assignment**? **Joe‚Äôs Coffee**, one of Chase‚Äôs borrowers, is **in default** on a **$50,000 business loan**. Joe used **everything he owned** to secure the loan‚Äîhis **espresso machines, inventory, accounts receivable, and even his fancy NFT of a coffee cup** (yeah, he thought that was a real asset).

Now? **Joe‚Äôs Coffee is sinking faster than the Titanic**, and Chase wants to get **PAID BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE**. Your job:

1. **Ensure Chase‚Äôs interest in Joe‚Äôs stuff is legally attached and perfected.**
2. **Confirm Chase has priority over Joe‚Äôs other lenders.**
3. **Advise on Chase‚Äôs legal weapons to seize Joe‚Äôs assets and get paid.**
4. **Consider Joe‚Äôs rights and defenses to slow Chase down.**

Joe is scrambling‚Äî**other creditors want a piece, his inventory is disappearing, and he‚Äôs panicking.** Chase wants action **NOW**. Can they seize his espresso machines? His business bank account? What‚Äôs the game plan?

# üí• APPLICABILITY: IF IT LOOKS LIKE A DUCK, IT‚ÄôS A SECURED TRANSACTION

UCC **Article 9** governs **any** transaction that **creates a security interest in personal property**. **It doesn‚Äôt matter what fancy name they slap on it**‚Äîif someone is **putting up collateral to get a loan**, we‚Äôre in **secured transactions land**.

üö® **‚ÄúBut It‚Äôs a Lease!‚Äù = Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire**

* **True Lease**: At the end of the lease, the goods **go back to the owner** with **no obligation to buy**.
* **Disguised Sale (Secured Interest)**: If the lease **requires** the debtor to buy or lets them buy it **for a buck**, it‚Äôs a **secured transaction** pretending to be a lease. **UCC Article 9 applies.**

üî• **Exam Sneaky Move:** They‚Äôll give you a **lease agreement** but slip in a clause where the lessee **must buy it at the end**‚Äî**that‚Äôs a disguised secured transaction** and you **treat it as one.**

# üìñ Frequently Used Secured Transactions Abbreviations

* **PMSI** ‚Äì *Purchase Money Security Interest* ‚Üí A **super-charged** security interest that lets a lender who finances the purchase of collateral **jump ahead of prior creditors** if they follow the rules.
* **BIOC** ‚Äì *Buyer in Ordinary Course of Business* ‚Üí A customer who buys goods from a business **without knowing** they‚Äôre collateralized. A BIOC **takes free** of security interests.
* **BFP** ‚Äì *Bona Fide Purchaser* ‚Üí Someone who **buys property for value, in good faith, and without notice** of another party‚Äôs interest.
* **FS** ‚Äì *Financing Statement* ‚Üí The document lenders **file with the state** to **perfect** their security interest.
* **UCC-1** ‚Äì The actual **form** used for a financing statement. **Filing this is how most lenders perfect their security interest.**
* **Fixture Filing** ‚Äì A **special UCC-1** used when collateral is attached to **real estate** (e.g., built-in espresso machines).

# üí∞ COLLATERAL: WHAT CAN YOU ACTUALLY SECURE?

Not all **collateral is created equal**. You wouldn‚Äôt put up your **grandma‚Äôs recipe book** for a business loan (or would you?), and banks don‚Äôt want **Joe‚Äôs Coffee Shop‚Äôs half-used oat milk supply**.

üëâ **A security interest ONLY attaches to something the debtor has rights in** and that falls into a **collateral category** recognized by Article 9.

# üîó STEP 1: ATTACHMENT ‚Äì HOW CHASE LOCKED IN ITS SECURITY INTEREST

Before Chase can **claim anything**, its security interest must have **attached**. No attachment = **no rights** = **Chase gets nothing**.

üî• **High-Scoring Rule Statement:**

Priority is all about **who acted first**.

>

üí£ **Mnemonic: ""VCR"" ‚Äì Security Interests Get STUCK**

1. **V**alue given (**Chase loans Joe $50,000**).
2. **C**ollateral rights (**Joe owns the espresso machines, inventory, and accounts receivable**).
3. **R**equirements met (**Joe signed a security agreement that describes the collateral**).

üö® **Chase‚Äôs Security Agreement Covered:**  
‚úÖ **Equipment** (espresso machines, furniture).  
‚úÖ **Inventory** (coffee beans, cups).  
‚úÖ **Accounts** (customers who owe Joe money).  
‚úÖ **Proceeds** (any money Joe gets from selling collateral).

üî• **What If Chase Messed Up?**

* If **Joe never signed** a security agreement? **No attachment** = Chase is out of luck.
* If Chase **loaned money before Joe got the espresso machines**? **Attachment doesn‚Äôt happen until Joe has rights in the collateral**

Joe **put up** all sorts of assets as collateral, but **not everything can be attached**. Let‚Äôs sort it out.

# ‚òï The Great Collateral Breakdown

https://preview.redd.it/wj52qjee7rhe1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0ebfbf445fb2c38b8caa9f4cf793c751d1a8325

üö® **Things Chase CANNOT attach:**  
‚ùå **Joe‚Äôs personal wages** (you can‚Äôt collateralize your salary).  
‚ùå **Social Security or disability benefits**.  
‚ùå **Personal injury settlement money** (if Joe gets hit by a truck, Chase can‚Äôt claim his lawsuit proceeds).

# üìú STEP 2: PERFECTION ‚Äì HOW CHASE MADE ITS CLAIM PUBLIC

You can‚Äôt just **attach** and call it a day‚Äî**perfection** makes the world recognize your claim.

**Attaching a security interest is good, but perfection is how you win fights.**

üî• **High-Scoring Rule Statement:**

>

üí£ **Mnemonic: ""FPCAT"" ‚Äì Five Paths to Perfection (Don‚Äôt Be a Lender Without One!)**

1. **Filing** a UCC-1 (for most things, including Joe‚Äôs equipment and inventory).
2. **Possession** (for chattel paper, instruments, stocks).
3. **Control** (for deposit accounts‚Äîif Chase controls Joe‚Äôs business account, it wins).
4. **Automatic Perfection** (Joe‚Äôs laptop at home? If Chase had a **PMSI in consumer goods**, it‚Äôd be automatically perfected).
5. **Temporary Perfection** (Proceeds? **Automatically perfected for 20 days.** After that, Chase must act).

üöÄ **How Chase Perfected:**  
‚úÖ **Filed a UCC-1 financing statement on Joe‚Äôs business assets** (inventory, equipment, accounts).  
‚úÖ **Controlled Joe‚Äôs Chase Business Account** (meaning Chase automatically wins over any lender that just filed a UCC-1).

üî• **What If Chase Screwed Up?**

* If Chase **never filed**? They **lose priority to anyone who did**.
* If Chase filed **after another creditor**? **They lose unless they‚Äôre a PMSI lender who followed the rules.**

üî• **Exam Sneaky Move:** If **collateral is a bank account**, Chase **must have control**‚Äîjust **filing a financing statement is useless**.

# ‚è≥ STEP 3: TIMING ISSUES ‚Äì HOW FAST CHASE HAD TO MOVE

Priority is all about **who acted first**.

üî• **High-Scoring Rule Statement:**

>

üí£ **Mnemonic: ""FAST CASH"" ‚Äì First to File, Always Stays Hot**

1. **F**irst to file or perfect wins (**Chase filed first, so they win unless a PMSI jumps ahead**).
2. **A**ll perfected interests beat **unperfected ones** (**Chase beats an unsecured lender every time**).
3. **S**tatutory liens (mechanic‚Äôs liens, tax liens) **can override** UCC security interests.
4. **T**imely PMSI notices **can override** Chase‚Äôs earlier filing.
5. **C**onflicting PMSIs ‚Üí **Inventory PMSI must be filed + prior creditors notified before delivery.**
6. **A**ccessions (add-ons to secured goods) **go to the secured party of the whole thing**.
7. **S**urvival of the BIOC (**a Buyer in Ordinary Course of Business takes free of Chase‚Äôs interest**).
8. **H**ome fixture rules (**real estate mortgage wins over Chase unless Chase filed a fixture filing**).

üö® **Timing Example:**

* Chase filed **on all assets in January**.
* Local Lender gave Joe a **PMSI in espresso machines in February** but **didn‚Äôt notify Chase**.
* **Who wins?** **Chase wins** because PMSI wasn‚Äôt properly perfected (no notice = no super-priority).

# üíÄ STEP 4: CHASE WANTS ITS MONEY ‚Äì REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT

Joe **missed three loan payments**. Chase is ready to **collect**.

üí£ **Mnemonic: ""STRIP"" ‚Äì Secured Party‚Äôs Last Resort**

1. **S**elf-help repossession (**allowed if no breach of peace**).
2. **T**ake possession via court order (**if Joe resists**).
3. **R**esale of collateral (**sale must be commercially reasonable**).
4. **I**nsufficiency (**Chase sues Joe for deficiency**).
5. **P**roceeds order (**expenses ‚Üí Chase‚Äôs debt ‚Üí junior creditors ‚Üí Joe gets surplus**).

üî• **What Chase Can Do Right Now:**  
‚úÖ **Repo Joe‚Äôs espresso machines** (but no breaking and entering).  
‚úÖ **Freeze Joe‚Äôs Chase business account** (because Chase has control).  
‚úÖ **Claim proceeds from inventory sales** (as long as Chase **acts within 20 days**).

üö® **Joe‚Äôs Rights to Fight Back:**

* **Redemption:** Joe can **pay off the full debt before Chase sells**.
* **Notice:** Chase **must notify Joe** before selling anything.
* **No Breach of Peace:** If Chase tries **midnight repo tactics**, Joe can **sue them**.
* **Commercial Reasonableness:** If Chase **sells the espresso machines for $500**, Joe can argue the sale was **bogus and avoid the deficiency judgment**.

# ‚öñÔ∏è STEP 5: DEFICIENCY JUDGMENTS ‚Äì WHEN CHASE STILL GETS TO SUE

üî• **High-Scoring Rule Statement:**

>

üöÄ **Example:**

* Chase **repossesses and sells** Joe‚Äôs espresso machines.
* Sale price? **$10,000** (but Joe still owes **$40,000**).
* Chase can **sue Joe for the $40,000 deficiency**.

üö® **But Joe Can Fight Back If:**  
‚ùå Chase **sold too cheap** and **didn‚Äôt market it properly**.  
‚ùå Chase **failed to give proper notice**.  
‚ùå The repo involved a **breach of peace**.

# üî• FINAL CALL: CHASE WANTS ITS MONEY ‚Äì YOUR MOVE, LAWYER.

‚úÖ **Repossess Joe‚Äôs espresso machines.**  
‚úÖ **Freeze Joe‚Äôs business account.**  
‚úÖ **Seize cash proceeds from inventory sales.**  
‚úÖ **Sue for a deficiency judgment if needed.**

**Now go win this case and prove you belong at Chase.** üöÄ

1ik131s,https://www.reddit.com/r/margaritavilleatsea/comments/1ik131s/a_review_of_my_recent_trip_on_margaritaville/,A review of my recent trip on Margaritaville Islander,"I wanted to give a run down of some of my thoughts and experiences on the Margaritaville at Sea Islander 1/14-1/19/2025.  The trip was Tampa to Key West and Progresso.

This might be a little out of order and I might give a little bit too much of my background but I think it's important to better understand my perspective as there's a cruise for everyone and not all cruises are for everyone.

TL:DR My wife and I and two sons (8 & 3) had a fantastic time, my kids have asked to go back many times since we've been back. My 3 yr old's preschool teacher texted saying she heard we had a lot of Margaritas! We will make sure to go again but have trips booked pretty full 2025/26 so our plan is January 2027 but we would like to find a time to go sooner.  We live in Buffalo/Niagara Falls, NY so if flights are cheap enough we'll go sooner.

We were staying in a suite so our experience will reflect the express pass type features included with that as well as the Islander dining room and concierge.  We also booked a cabana in the 5 O'clock Somewhere pool area. This is NOT a brag, I just want you to know that our experience did include upgrades but I will try to make observations of the experience as a whole.

Boarding was fast and easy, we had a lounge and priority boarding time/place but observing the regular lines it also looked relatively efficient and well laid out.  It was a nice modern terminal relatively easy to navigate.

The room was gorgeous. I have watched many YouTubes (you probably have as well) and so I knew the d√©cor, layout etc. but in person it was just as nice. The room was very nicely refinished and in the suite it has a hardwood look laminate that really made it feel special.  The wainscoting walls were also a very nice tough.  Our bathroom was very big with a double sink and tub/shower with jets that our 3 yr old enjoyed.  Seeing the other rooms online I'm sure they are also just as nice if this level of attention to details was followed which I'm sure it was, just a little bit less space.  The balcony being exposed to the saltwater was the area needing the most work, it was nice and large but could use more furniture and such which I'm sure will evolve over time.

Most every area of the ship had already been updated so while the ship is over 20 yrs old it felt new in most ways and old in the ways that count, SPACE.  This was back when cramming every last inch wasn't as important and even main lines (Costa/Carnival) built ships to impress people with space. (If you want to learn more about the designer, the legend look up Joe Farcus and also check out This Cruise Life on YouTube, Mark and Rocky are big Farcus design fans). Margaritaville at Sea has taken a beautiful albeit overly Italian (my mom is Italian I can say it that way lol) Costa/Farcus ship and just really brought out that design in a fun beech loving Buffett/Margaritaville way.  Every spot they touched (most of the ship) builds on the great design and in most areas it really sets the tone and the laid back vibe.

Kids areas: So here I'm going to do a little Disney Cruise Line jabbing.  For perspective we are huge Disney people and went there on our way to MaS Islander (flew into Orlando) and my kids went on Disney Wish in August, my wife and I are former WDW cast members and she had been on DCL before the Wish.  MaS Islander is an AWESOME ship for kids.  My kids loved it.  There are four kids clubs.  My kids were in the two youngest, Jolly Mon and Parakeets which art connected and when there weren't a lot of kids there or they were doing an all ages program they had them together but when doing things like Gagaball (IYKYK) they did that for the bigger kids only.  The staff was fantastic, all of them, DCL has a great kids club staff and MaS does too.  The space is no DCL Wish, but my kids had just as much fun.  My 8 yr prefers activities like Gagaball to character meet and greets (though MaS has those too with Parrot Pete).  They had themes for each part of the day, something DCL should do, those themes related to crafts or activities for that part of the day.  They had movies and video games for the kids as well and my kids always wanted to go back.  The top deck is a kids (and adults) paradise (pun).  There is a pickleball court, 9 holes of minigolf and 9 holes of a cornhole golf (really near) all themed brilliantly Margaritaville.  There is also a playground with dry slides and climbing and a multistory waterslide all called the Caribbean Amphibian (see Disney IP section below for that). My older son said he was going to go down the slide 50 times and I bet he did.  The nice thing of this ship was there are tons of kids things but its not filled to the rafters with them so a playground is not overrun its very nice, the waterslide almost never had a line and so you can have nice spaces which admittedly would be very difficult on DCL, Royal or Carnival where there are just ton of kids.  I'm sure on school breaks these could become busier but this was nice.  The ship also had some of the largest pools and hot tubs we've seen at sea.  There are three of each with two being all ages and one in the HUGE adults only deck (more on that later).

The lido deck is where all three pools and hot tubs are, the buffet, Cheeseburger in Paradise, Mexican Cutie Cantina, Frank & Lola's Pizza, Margaritaville Coffee shop, a stage in the retractable dome 5 O'clock Somewhere pool and bar and the big outdoor screen in the Landshark Pool and bar area.  We were fortunate enough to rent a cabana in the 5 O'Clock somewhere pool area for the length of our cruise so we always had a home base to eat, drink or hang out in the pool area.  Compared to other cruises there were not as many ""chair hogs"" which may have been mitigated by having to give your room info when getting towels (also where you got putters and pickleball equipment) or it may have been mitigated by the fact that there's tons of lounge chairs on the upper deck that look out at the ocean and the MAS crowd is a more ocean focused bunch, certainly Jimmy was.  The pools had an awesome spill over area where our 3 yr old liked to play but also in water loungers could be place and there was good seating and even in pool table(s) to put your drink and watch the kids.  People are much more chill on MAS and didn't seem to mind the kids playing.  Having a HUGE adults only pool (same size as the other two pools) also probably helped, more on that later. My wife and I when we cruise alone will rarely be found on the lido deck, I like to look at the ocean not the pool but we found ourselves there a ton.  Fortunately our cabana could see both the pool and ocean which helped but also with kids this area served as our hub.  One night they watched Jurassic World (IYKYK) on the big screen by the Landshark pool but for the most part we were in the 5 O'Clock pool area where the ice cream machines (one on each side) and other food options lived.

Food: While there were a few dishes that were misses the food overall was great, with some being absolutely excellent.  Many have gone into lots of details on the food so I won't go on forever but I'll go through it all.  We did the ""food pass"" whatever its called so we got something from every specialty restaurant.  We also had a cabin class that included the Islander dining room (its a certain balcony level and above).  There's been a lot said on Fins vs Islander so I will take an unpopular stance: I love the idea.  We have had suite class dining on past cruises and we enjoyed that but I really like the way MAS does it.  Both restaurants Fins the MDR downstairs and Islander the suites etc. MDR upstairs have the same base menu, Islander has an insert that included additional choices.  In the past in suite dining (Celebrity) we have asked for the MDR menu to expand the choices especially for apps so it was nice to just be given it all.  I also like that Islander can just be added on for $20 if you would like to experience it.  Most in the internet groups hate all this elitism but to me this gives you so many ways to get in its the opposite.  The food pass also includes it for one night as well as the champagne brunch Islander.  If you think there's value in it or if you like the menu that day or just want to try it, they let you.  That's what Jimmy would have done, that's not how other cruise line's suites dining room works.  Many have said its not worth it or whatever, that's their opinion.  I ordered off of the insert at least one if not all of my courses almost every night we ate there.  For me it would have been worth it even if we didn't have it included.  Your mileage may vary, we all cruise in our own ways.  Islander also has different furniture and tablecloths if that does it for you. Tablecloths do nothing for me, but I do think it was a nice touch to differentiate for those that enjoy that. Enough on that.  We didn't eat a lot at the buffet which I find to mean the ship had so many choices.  We're not buffet people that's just our thing.  It's location was great though so my son could grab the things he wanted while we ate other things.  There was a prime rib day that looked good but we had other meal plans then.  It's a buffet, many say they wish it had more choices, it looked like a lot to me, and when we did get items they were good.  For cruise buffet aficionados maybe its not the best ever, idk, the other options were so good and open enough especially on sea days that I didn't need it much.  Cheeseburger in Paradise  got eaten a LOT especially by my kids.  The burgers were great, some of the best at sea and the toppings bar (don't miss it you can) had the right options.  They also use it and the toppings bar as a sort of buffet extension for breakfast complete with one omelet station (more at the pizza place) which was AWESOME.  Mexican Cutie Cantina was also a favorite, opposite Cheeseburger in the 5 O'clock pool area it served some excellent custom tacos (don't miss the toppings bar) and for breakfast they had breakfast tacos, an awesome touch.  In the buffet area towards the aft there are two other eating areas. Frank & Lola's Pizza and the Margaritaville Coffee shop.  Frank & Lola's is included and does omelets for breakfast, pizza most of the day and in the evening they switch to deep dish pizza, a great touch.  The pizza was good and a convenient thing to bring back to the room.  There is room service (not included) but we did not try it.  The coffee shop (not included but VERY reasonable) had great coffee, the rest of the ships coffee like most ships was not great.  The sandwiches and pastries there also not included were very good and worth a few bucks to my wife, which she often grabbed and brought back to our balcony in the AM.  Moving further aft the adult deck has not one but two restaurants which I will mention in the adults deck section.  Other food.  Sushi in the Farside Lounge was excellent, I love sushi, eat it frequently and it was awesome.  Ask for it to go and they will package it really nice to take wherever.  I've saved the best for last JWB Steakhouse (James William Buffet). Located way up top with a cool glass staircase if you don't want to take the awesome elevators, JWB is decorated in a fun nautical but also sophisticated way with lots of Jimmy nods.  The food was excellent.  All of it.  The wagyu meatballs have been covered and they lived up to their hype.  The steak was great (tried my wife's) and ... the lamb was some of the best I have ever had and I order a LOT of lamb (weirdly).  I would say the best I've ever had and I've ordered it at some really nice places.  Side note 1923 one of the 'MDR' options on DCL Wish had excellent lamb just a notch or so below this but for an included option that speaks volumes, I was very impressed with 1923 we ate there twice in our rotation.  Back to JWB, it was excellent, its worth the upcharge (or dining pass).  I will make sure to go again.  We also drank at the bar there after dinner because we enjoyed the space so much.  They have a sophisticated coffee setup there too (espresso martini) but if you don't want the base coffee this is another option after dinner.

Adult Deck: Again the adult deck was huge.  My understanding is this is the space of the Serenity Deck on the Carnival Spirit class which is often rated the largest/nicest of those in the fleet. Which is funny because even though these are sister ships both spaces were not originally that.  The deck has gorgeous wake views with a full sized pool and hot tub, lots of deck chairs, cabanas for rent (two I believe) and two restaurants and a bar complete with in the shade dining seating.  We had our kids, a balcony and the aforementioned cabana in the other pool area so we didn't spend a lot of time there but I wanted to check it out.  With the food pass we were able to eat at both the Island Eats and Tiki Grill (otherwise upcharge) food and everything from lobster rolls to tiki wings (we're from Buffalo so we don't order ""hot"" chicken wings elsewhere LOL) were very good.  Too much food was included in the pass.  We ordered it and brought to the room to share with our kids and had way too much.  On our next trip we might skip because there's just SO MANY good food options, but if you're in the adult deck a lot its awesome there are TWO food options.  I enjoy an adult deck and this one is a really nice large one with a great location.  The bar was cleverly themed and there were lots of seats but it was always a hub of activity.  The vibe back there was definitely island fun and without our kids we might have spent more time there though there are so many great places on the ship.

Bars, Lounges.  I don't know where to start with this.  We checked out most of the bars and had drinks at about half of them.  Many have covered this so I will just say: Our favorite bar was Havana Daydreaming and my wife had the best Cuba Libre (Rum and Coke) she has ever had and that is her favorite drink so she has had LOT of them.  How do you make a good rum and coke... muddle the limes apparently, but anyway its a great Cuba themed sports bar with live music.  If you don't like a bar's theme, drinks or music, there's so many, just find another.  We also had great bar service and good drinks at the pool deck.  There was drink service in row in the theater which was awesome.

Entertainment: Again with kids this was little different.  We did make the Honky Tonk show with the kids and the theater is a great space with lots of room, something you don't see any more, space.  The show was great, even if you don't like country music most of the songs were very well known, live band is something few shows have anymore and the acrobatics were really well done.  Can't speak to the rest of the shows unfortunately.  The entertainment schedule was plenty for us, on a printed daily schedule with QR code (though I like carrying it around).  We did superhero trivia (while waiting for sushi), origami, board games, circus tricks with the kids club staff, the Hero's Salute, and other things I'm sure I'm forgetting.  There was certainly a LOT of things we didn't do and a bit of something for everyone.  We don't typically do much except the shows/comedians (who I heard was good) when we don't have kids so this is not usually a big area for us but we were pleasantly surprised.  We also took the bridge and engine control room tour, not included but that was worth it to us, we saw a lot and learned a lot, if you have interest in the workings of a cruise ship I would recommend.

Speakeasy: I won't say much except it was a really fun and worthwhile experience to us.  If you are even slightly into Jimmy Buffett (even if your not) but if you are, its probably worth it.  We were lucky to have a Margaritaville Executive and friend of Jimmy's with us to enhance it, but its a really cool thing and while we might not do it every sailing, they intend to change the memorabilia and experience for repeatability and even made some tweaks that we were the first to see.  And the drinks were great, diverse and plentiful.

Suite Stuff: I know I mentioned the room already but I wanted to cover the suite perks as a lot of people have glossed over them and unlike many cruise lines the suites are not insanely priced (relative to the industry) so this might be your chance.  The suite itself as mentioned was really nice and updated.  A lot of space which is very nice with 4 people.  Besides the nice large room, bathroom and balcony the suite comes with large water bottles daily.  Priority boarding, disembarking, and going ashore in port.  Priority theater seating, Islander dining along with a concierge and lounge with pop/soda cans.  Our experience with concierge services while cruising is they are what you make of them and sometimes they can be really helpful, otherwise if you don't ask they can't help.  They reserve the theater seating and help you skip the line to get off the ship, but I have found (by not using them and wondering what I'm missing on other lines), ask them first, they don't always have the answer but it doesn't hurt to start there, it skips a long line most of the time and often they can call in favors or make things happen.  Is this worth it? That depends on what reservations etc. you might want.  We got all the reservations (QMN, JWB) and such we wanted so that's all I can ask.  I will say the Shore Excursion Desk was excellent and helped book and gave the ship tour and took us right up to Lido to look at all the cabanas on the first day.

Disney IP lovers: I have joked that there is just as much Disney IP on Islander as on Wish and if you're a Muppets fan there is actually more.  The playground and slide area is called the ""Caribbean Amphibian"" this is a reference to Jimmy Buffett's song with Kermit the Frog (yes that guy) which he wrote in the 80's and is seen singing alongside Kermit in a 1999 special (YouTube this).  There are zero Muppets references on Wish and only one I know of on the entire DCL fleet.  PS that is not the only song Jimmy sung with a Muppet, look up his rendition of Mr. Spaceman with Gonzo and Rizzo.  I also might have nudged them to make another Kermit reference in the speakeasy, it isn't there yet but there was a conversation, so you're welcome Disney fans LOL.  More Disney IP:  Jolly Mon is the name of Capt. Jack Sparrow's small ship in the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie.  It is the name of Jimmy Buffett's children's book about pirates and the writers named it after Jimmy, so there's roughly the same amount of Pirates of the Caribbean references as Wish.  In the arcade (still looking for the Wish arcade PS) there is a Star Wars video game so there are also more Star Wars video games on the Islander and for the price I paid for Wish my kids could play it on Islander 24/7 LOL. I just love little things like that.  My kids love that stuff too.., the know Caribbean Amphibian by heart, they have read Jolly Mon and just as you can... program.... I mean teach your kids to love Disney IP so can they learn Margaritaville IP.  PS One IP we found on Islander that my kids LOVE that you won't find on DCL: Jurassic World which was shown both on the main pool screen and in the rooms and in the kids club.  Jimmy Buffett is in that movie (yes) and my kids have the action figure (also yes) and think its hilarious, there is also a Margaritaville restaurant in the movie.  PS I hate Disney IP when it is just slapped on shit... I'm an Epcot guy, I worked there and I think it is important to build your own identity but I love little tiny and totally relevant nods.  Well done MAS, the Caribbean Amphibian was brilliant.

I know I went into silly details on some things and glossed over others. I am happy to share more of MY experience in the comments if you have specifics.  Again this is my take and yours will vary.  But I really enjoyed and am happy to see a new entry into this cruise space and will be going again.

My background, if you don't care or just think this is a brag skip this, I just like to know my author's point of view: My wife and I are 40 and have two boys, 8 and 3.  They have been on Disney Wish before, this was their second cruise.  Between the two of us we have been on Carnival a few times, including booze cruises in our 20's; NCL including a Mediterranean cruise for our honeymoon; and Royal (girls trip for her).  Along with Disney (her with and without our kids), Celebrity (in Retreat more than once) and the Ritz Carlton Yacht Evrima on one of its first sailings (#6).  Our next two booked cruises are NCL and Princess (Alaska). We have been to Castaway, CocoCay and Great Stirrup Cay for private island experiences along with the Virgin Beach Club (Bimini) while on one of our Celebrity trips.  We are both working professionals in the Buffalo/Niagara area who enjoy vacation, as mentioned we love Disney and are former cast members but we also love history and have degrees in it so we enjoyed our Key West tour.  Our oldest takes Junior Sailing (I am a poor sailor myself learning as an adult) so he loves boats but I think he prefers to have someone else sail for him.  Our experience on a diverse number of cruise lines, destinations and people with us is there is a cruise for everyone and not all cruises are for everyone.",1,1738950819.0,margaritavilleatsea,0,1.0,False

1ik0zvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1ik0zvv/the_simple_technique_i_use_to_cultivate_buddha/,The simple technique I use to cultivate Buddha Nature,"Every meditation should begin by reminding yourself that it‚Äôs an achievement to be sat there. You‚Äôre already doing what 99% of the population don‚Äôt.

Remind yourself that the opportunity to practice is a blessing. There are countless people out there that wish to commit to a practice, but have life circumstances that make it incredibly challenging.

Your sitting meditation practice is an opportunity to build concentration and cultivate mindful awareness. These tools can help you attain insight into the true nature of reality; the most precious realisation.

# Seeing the nature of reality

The objective of insight meditation is to realise that truth of suffering. It is caused by our attachment and identification to empty and impermanent phenomena, including the construct of ‚Äúself.‚Äù

All these phenomena are mere projections of mind, and it these same projections of mind that stand as the only barrier between the temporary, suffering form of who we‚Äôve become mistakenly identified with, and the infinite, formless, cosmic consciousness of what we truly are.

Our objective is not to understand this on an intellectual level, from the outside in. Our objective is to realise it from the inside-out, through the core of our being, through direct experience.

***We can break free from mind constraints.***

***We can become liberated from our suffering***

***We can become empowered to help other do the same.***

Striving to do this and become a¬†*Bodhisattva*¬†is one of the highest achievements we can set in this lifetime. This is¬†*Bodhicitta*; the desire and compassionate mind to attain¬†*Buddhahood*¬†for the benefit of all sentient beings.

# Handling mind-wandering

It goes without saying that attaining Buddhahood is not an easy feat to accomplish.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to clearly set your intentions in meditation; to remind focussed on the meditation object (commonly the breath) and gently, but firmly, redirect your attention when it has drifted.

When your attention drifts, as it inevitably will do, you can use¬†*The AARC Approach*;

***Acknowledge that the mind has wandered***

***Accept it without resistance or judgment***

***Redirect your attention to the meditation object***

***Connect with your higher purpose***

The final step of connecting is what people ask the most questions about, and that‚Äôs what I want to shed some light on.

# The seed of enlightenment

What is is that we all share, deep within, that we can connect to when meditation gets hard? That would be our¬†*Buddha Nature*, of course.

This is the seed of enlightenment that lies within all of us. It is simply the potential to awaken and realise what we truly are, behind all our narratives, projections, identifications, attachments and aversions.

Buddha simply means awakened one, and that was why Siddhartha Guatama became¬†*The Buddha*.

After enlightenment, he was no longer the prince with which his consciousness had previously identified. He became connected to something far more expansive, beyond what words.

# Cultivating sati

So what can we simple people do to connect with this? Meditation is a good start, but there‚Äôs more to it than that.

Mindfulness originates from the Pali word,¬†*sati*, which roughly means remembering. More specifically, it means remembering to be the observer, the consciousness itself, rather than the objects of consciousness.

Living with mindfulness, in pure awareness, opens us to the possibility of anything, to have what Shunryu Suzuki called Beginner‚Äôs Mind, or¬†*Shoshin*. It is not dissimilar to having the innocent mind of a young child, free from projections and preconceptions.

***‚ÄúIn the beginner‚Äôs mind there are many possibilities, in the experts, there are few.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäShunryu Suzuki***

Think about it. How many experts do you know that seem happy and free? Not many, because most of them think they already know everything. No matter their domain, they‚Äôre closed off to any new possibilities that life may have to offer.

So, do you want to be the expert that thinks they already know everything about life, or do you want to live with the invigorating curiosity of a child?

Wouldn‚Äôt you rather be open to realising new possibilities in each moment and seeing the world in a different way? Enlightenment is possible.

# A new framework for enlightenment

I‚Äôve tried to create a simple framework to help you channel this perspective, I call it¬†*The ABC Method to Enlightenment*.

It doesn‚Äôt guarantee enlightenment, but using this framework should help you live your life in such a way that brings you closer to awakening to your true nature. The best thing is that it‚Äôs simple. In fact, it‚Äôs as easy as ABC.

# Acknowledge your Buddha Nature.

Recognise the seed of enlightenment that lies within you. The source of creation is a part of you, it has to be for you to exist. Feel it deep within and understand that awakening is a real possibility. It is simply realising what you truly are, behind the narrative.

# Believe in the potential for the seed to germinate.

Your Buddha Nature is not profound. It simply the latent ability within you to realise what you truly are beyond this temporary human experience. Stop believing it is something out of reach. Although believing doesn‚Äôt make it certain, failure to believe makes it impossible.

# Create the space for the seed to flourish.

Make conscious choices in the way you live. Bring mindful awareness into your life. Drive without the radio. Eat without watching the TV. Do one thing at a time. Allow yourself to live a little, but these are all ways you can create space.

# Always be prepared

If you truly believe that awaking is a possibility, then you must also accept that it could happen at any time, not just during a meditation or yoga session.

If you realise this, then you might decide to take a few deep breaths and enjoy the moment as you queue for your coffee. It creates space for the light to come in, unlike what most people default to; checking emails or scrolling their socials.

***Awakening is possible, but it your responsibility to put in the work and create the space for it to unfold.***

***It is your seed, and you are responsible for cultivating it.***

When you‚Äôre stuck or feel like you‚Äôre lost your purpose during meditation, use The ABC Method to connect with your Buddha Nature.

When you lose motivation to live with mindful awareness, use The ABC Method to remind yourself that awakening could occur at any time.

It's all about Dopamine Beta-Hydroxylase (DBH) dysfunction.,"I've been lurking here for a while, observing all your symptoms, comparing them to my own, and trying different approaches. I've explored every possible theory, so trust me when I say I know what I'm talking about. This encompasses all aspects of HE

I know it's a bold claim, but this honestly seems like the only logical conclusion: **Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) deficiency**, a.k.a. not enough norepinephrine in your system.

# Why do I think it's DBH deficiency?

I compared all the reported symptoms and the remedies that seem to work anecdotally. It was that simple.

# Do you experience:

* Almost constant low blood pressure, orthostatic intolerance (POTS)?
* Brain fog, distractibility, mild memory lapses?
* Anxiety, mood swings, occasional irritability?
* Low energy, feeling ""tired but wired,"" sudden energy crashes?
* Sleep issues, trouble waking up, feeling unrested despite sleep?
* Cold hands and feet?
* Temperature regulation problems, excessive sweating or no sweating at all?
* Runny or stuffy nose?
* Ptosis (drooping eyelid)?
* Difficulty breathing?
* Gut issues like slow digestion and bloating?
* Muscle, joint, or body pain?
* Coffee making you feel worse instead of better?
* Even erectile dysfunction and other sex-related issues?

All of these are symptoms of **DBH deficiency/dysfunction**, and from my perspective, it seems like 90% of the users here experience them. If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me.

# But the biggest question is: Why is this happening to our bodies?

It can be explained by **norepinephrine deficiency** caused by **downregulated or dysfunctional DBH**.

For example:

* **Low Blood Pressure & POTS** \- Norepinephrine is crucial for vasoconstriction. Without it, blood vessels stay too relaxed, causing blood to pool in the lower extremities.
* **Brain Fog & Attention Issues** \- NE is vital for focus and cognition. Lack of it mimics ADHD symptoms.
* **Cold Hands & Feet / Sweating Issues** \- NE helps regulate body temperature and blood circulation.
* **Runny Nose & Ptosis** \- These are hallmark symptoms of DBH deficiency due to autonomic dysfunction.

# What is DBH?

DBH is the **enzyme that converts dopamine into norepinephrine (NE)**. When DBH levels are low, dopamine builds up while norepinephrine remains deficient, causing an imbalance in:

* Energy levels
* Focus and attention
* Blood pressure
* Autonomic nervous system function

# What makes you feel better?

All of these factors **increase norepinephrine in some way**:

* **Vitamin C** \- 90% of people here report benefits, and it happens to be (**+Copper**) the **#1 co-factor for DBH**.
* **Alcohol hangovers (not just alcohol itself)** \- A severe stressor that increases norepinephrine.
* **Sleep deprivation** \- Another stress response that boosts norepinephrine.
* **Illness** \- Temporarily raises norepinephrine levels.
* **Extreme heat/cold exposure (saunas, hot tubs, cold showers)** \- Stress response = norepinephrine boost.
* **Stressful or extreme situations** \- Many people report needing to feel anger to function properly.
* **Ephedrine & Pseudoephedrine** \- Directly increase norepinephrine.
* **Atomoxetine (Strattera)** \- A norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor frequently reported to help.
* **Thiamine (B1)** \- Acts on the vagus nerve, influencing autonomic function.
* **Probiotics** \- Affect gut microbiome, which plays a role in neurotransmitter regulation.

At this point, some of you might be thinking:  
*""Oh great, another genius just describing ADHD, CFS, etc., and concluding that stimulants work.""*

But let me be clear, this goes beyond just **ADHD, CFS, or anxiety**. It‚Äôs actually a **complex HPA axis dysfunction** driven by **chronic low norepinephrine levels**. This isn‚Äôt just a simple neurotransmitter imbalance; it‚Äôs a **systemic norepinephrine deficiency with far-reaching effects**. And no, **stimulants don‚Äôt always work**, or at least, not in the expected way.

# Here‚Äôs why:

Over time, this condition **leads to upregulation of adrenergic receptors**, making them **hypersensitive**. This throws off both the **sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems**, creating a state of dysregulation.

# What does this mean in practice?

It means that **even the slightest surge of norepinephrine** can cause **adrenergic receptors (alpha and beta) to overreact**, leading to **intense anxiety and nervous system overactivation**. The body, in an attempt to compensate for the norepinephrine deficit, starts **overproducing adrenaline**, further amplifying the stress response. **norepinephrine** is primarily released from **nerve endings**, while **epinephrine (adrenaline)** is released from the adrenal glands.

To make things worse, **some stimulants increase dopamine production** rather than norepinephrine. But we **don‚Äôt need more dopamine, because** we already have **too much**. This **dopamine overload** becomes another major driver of anxiety, compounding the issue rather than resolving it.

That‚Äôs why some of us actually **feel worse on certain stimulants** or even experience **paradoxical reactions when increasing norepinephrine**.

Since our adrenergic receptors are already **hypersensitive** from prolonged norepinephrine deficiency, any sudden increase (whether from **medication, stress, or other triggers**) can push the nervous system into **overdrive**, leading to extreme anxiety, overstimulation, or even a crash.

# But What‚Äôs Causing It?

To be honest, I don‚Äôt know for sure. There are a few possibilities, and it‚Äôs likely a **combination of factors** rather than just one root cause.

# 1. A Mild Genetic Disorder

One possibility is that some of us have a **mild genetic mutation** affecting **dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) production or function**.  
Genetic variations in the **DBH gene** could lead to:

* Reduced enzyme activity, causing **too much dopamine** and **not enough norepinephrine**.
* A nervous system that is constantly trying (and failing) to compensate.
* Increased sensitivity of adrenergic receptors over time.

# 2. Epigenetic Deficiency

Even if the **DBH gene itself isn‚Äôt mutated**, certain **environmental or lifestyle factors** may be **suppressing its function** through **epigenetic changes**, such as:

* Chronic stress
* Inflammation
* Nutrient deficiencies (Vitamin C, Copper, B Vitamins)
* Exposure to environmental toxins

# 3. The Microbiome or The Gut-Brain Connection

Our **gut microbiome** plays a major role in **neurotransmitter regulation**, and **disruptions in gut bacteria** could contribute to **low norepinephrine levels**.

One key factor here is **P-cresol**, an **old friend to this sub** and a microbial byproduct.

# What is p-Cresol and How Does It Affect Norepinephrine?

* **p-Cresol is a toxic byproduct** produced by some gut bacteria.
* High levels of **p-Cresol inhibit dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH)**, preventing dopamine from converting into norepinephrine.
* This leads to **high dopamine, low norepinephrine**, causing the exact issues we‚Äôre seeing.

# Final Thoughts

This post is already quite long, and I don‚Äôt want to delve too much into speculation‚Äîespecially since we‚Äôre right at the limits of what science currently understands. I also have a collection of research and links that support these findings, but lets keep things simple.

However, I‚Äôd really love to hear from you all, your experiences, thoughts, and insights. Let‚Äôs start a discussion and see where it leads!

If you‚Äôre like me and need a mix of good coffee, decent food, and enough space to not feel cramped, here‚Äôs my take on a few spots esp if you're digital nomad or just want to go out and work outside for the day without breaking bank.

# Brew Coffee House ‚Äì My Top Pick

This is hands down the best spot I‚Äôve found so far. It‚Äôs spacious, has good food, and the coffee is decent. The seating is comfortable, and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in the way if I stay for a few hours. If you‚Äôre looking for a solid place to work remotely, this is my recommendation.

# Spoonaz ‚Äì Good, But Too Small Inside

Spoonaz has a nice vibe, and if you don‚Äôt mind working outside, the deck is an option. But realistically, Belize is hot, and I don‚Äôt want to be sweating while trying to work. The inside is a bit too small for my taste, so while I like the spot, it‚Äôs not my go-to for work.

# Mapp Street ‚Äì Good Food & Friendly Staff

This is another solid option, especially if you want more variety for lunch. The seating is comfortable, and the staff is always welcoming. It‚Äôs a good balance between a work-friendly environment and a place to grab a nice meal.

# Bleu ‚Äì Best Pastries, But Not a Work Spot

If we‚Äôre talking pastries, Bleu is my favorite. Their selection is top-tier. But as a workspace? Not so much. The inside is tiny, and with limited seating, I feel bad taking up one of their few tables for hours. Great for a quick coffee and treat, but not a place to camp out with a laptop.

# Biltmore Caf√© ‚Äì It's okay...

Biltmore Caf√© is another great option, especially if you‚Äôre looking for a quieter place to work. The space is bigger than some of the other caf√©s, and it has a more relaxed atmosphere. The coffee is good, and they have solid food options if you plan to stay for a while. Definitely worth checking out if you‚Äôre looking for a comfortable spot.

Here are three Greek myths reimagined in the world of *Parks and Recreation*:  

---

### **1. Leslie Knope and the Labors of Pawnee (The Twelve Labors of Hercules)**  

After being unfairly demoted by the Pawnee City Council, Leslie Knope must complete twelve impossible tasks to prove her worth and earn back her role as Deputy Director of the Parks Department.  

1. **Wrangle the Raccoons of City Hall** ‚Äì Pawnee's aggressive raccoon population has grown out of control. Leslie must capture the elusive ""King Raccoon,"" who has been living in the air vents and stealing waffles from JJ‚Äôs Diner.  
2. **Obtain Ron Swanson‚Äôs Approval** ‚Äì Ron, as the department‚Äôs ""god of wisdom and woodworking,"" has refused to give Leslie any advice. She must get him to compliment her work ethic.  
3. **Clean the Pit** ‚Äì The infamous pit behind Ann Perkins‚Äô house must be filled and turned into a park without using government funds.  
4. **Out-drink Donna Meagle** ‚Äì At the Snakehole Lounge, Leslie must outlast Donna in a drinking contest while still making it to work on time the next morning.  
5. **Return Jerry‚Äôs Stolen Mug** ‚Äì The most legendary item in Pawnee: Jerry‚Äôs missing coffee mug. It has been lost for years, and only Burt Macklin (aka Andy Dwyer) can track it down.  
6. **Win Over Eagleton** ‚Äì Leslie must convince the snobbish residents of Eagleton to attend a Pawnee event.  
7. **Survive a Town Hall Meeting** ‚Äì She must get through a three-hour public forum without losing her cool (or being pelted with corn dogs).  
8. **Defeat the Curse of the Harvest Festival** ‚Äì A Lil‚Äô Sebastian-related catastrophe threatens the event. Leslie must appease the Pawnee deities (aka the citizens) to save it.  
9. **Retrieve Ron‚Äôs Lost Steak** ‚Äì A legendary steak from Mulligan‚Äôs Steakhouse has gone missing. Leslie must track it down before Ron swears off government forever.  
10. **Build a Park with No Budget** ‚Äì Can Leslie create a fully functional park using only donated materials and favors?  
11. **Convince Ben Wyatt to Love Calzones Again** ‚Äì After a tragic calzone-related food poisoning incident, Ben has sworn them off forever. Leslie must restore his faith in the ""perfect pocket of deliciousness.""  
12. **Throw the Greatest Galentine‚Äôs Day Ever** ‚Äì The final task: unite all the women of Pawnee for the best Galentine‚Äôs Day celebration in history.  

Leslie triumphs, proving that bureaucracy is no match for her determination (and binders full of plans).  

---

### **2. The Trojan Treat Yo‚Äô Self (The Trojan War)**  

Tom Haverford and Donna Meagle‚Äôs annual **Treat Yo‚Äô Self** day has gotten so extravagant that Eagleton refuses to let them in. Enraged, Tom devises a plan: the **Trojan Treat Yo‚Äô Self**, a luxury-filled gift basket they will present as an ‚Äúapology‚Äù to Eagleton, while secretly sneaking inside to take back their rightful place at the spa.  

Inside the lavish basket are Donna, Tom, and Jean-Ralphio, armed with platinum credit cards and extravagant outfits. Once inside, they unleash pure chaos: renting out the entire spa, ordering gold-flaked waffles, and singing karaoke versions of ‚Äò90s R&B hits.  

Eagleton eventually surrenders, agreeing to let Pawnee citizens partake in their luxurious services, as long as Jean-Ralphio never returns.  

---

### **3. Andy Dwyer‚Äôs Journey to the Underworld (Orpheus and Eurydice)**  

When April is forced to temporarily move to Washington, D.C., Andy (as his alter ego, Burt Macklin, FBI) embarks on a heroic quest to bring her back.  

Guided by Ron (a reluctant Charon, ferrying Andy via his truck), he navigates the dark depths of **Washington‚Äôs Bureaucratic Underworld**, facing many perils:  

- **The Red Tape Hydra** ‚Äì A multi-headed paperwork monster at the Department of the Interior.  
- **The Lobbyists‚Äô Siren Song** ‚Äì Wealthy influencers trying to convince Andy to abandon his mission and endorse their causes (including an all-calzone restaurant).  
- **The Final Test: The April Gaze** ‚Äì Just like Orpheus, Andy must resist the temptation to look at April before she‚Äôs officially allowed back in Pawnee. Unfortunately, he immediately FaceTimes her while riding home, causing a slight delay in her return.  

But in true Andy-and-April fashion, everything works out in the end, mostly by accident.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Coffee lovers find joy in experimenting with different flavors and textures. If you follow a vegan lifestyle, there‚Äôs no need to miss out on that creamy, delicious cup of coffee. Here are seven vegan coffee hacks to make your brew rich and velvety, all without dairy.

### 1. Nut and Seed Milk

One of the best ways to achieve a creamy texture in your coffee is to use nut or seed milk. Options like almond, cashew, and hemp milk are fantastic choices. They blend well with coffee and add a slight nutty flavor that elevates your drink. Cashew milk, in particular, is thicker and creamier, making it perfect for lattes. To make it at home, soak your nuts overnight, blend with water, and strain through a cheesecloth.

### 2. Coconut Cream

Coconut cream is another rich alternative that can transform your coffee experience. It‚Äôs smooth and fluffy, offering a tropical vibe to your morning brew. You can either scoop it directly from a can of full-fat coconut milk or make your own by blending fresh coconut meat with water. A dollop on top of your coffee or mixed in will add a luxurious texture, making every sip delightful.

### 3. Oat Milk Magic

Oat milk has surged in popularity for good reason. It‚Äôs naturally creamy and has a subtle sweetness, which makes it an excellent option for coffee. When heated, oat milk froths beautifully, perfect for cappuccinos. Just look for brands that don‚Äôt contain added sugars or preservatives for the best flavor and consistency. You can easily make oat milk at home by blending oats with water, then straining it.

### 4. Aquafaba Whip

Aquafaba, the liquid from cooked chickpeas, is an excellent plant-based alternative to whipped cream. It can be whipped into soft peaks, adding a fluffy texture to your coffee. Just whip aquafaba with a touch of vanilla and a sweetener of your choice until it reaches the desired consistency. This not only adds creaminess but also a fun element to your dairy-free coffee drink.

### 5. Silken Tofu Blend

If you want your coffee to be ultra-rich, consider blending in silken tofu. It's packed with protein and offers a creamy texture that makes your coffee thick and satisfying. Blend a small amount with your favorite sweetener and extract. Add this mixture to your brewed coffee for a creamy and filling drink. It‚Äôs particularly great for those who enjoy a protein boost any time of day.

### 6. Flavored Creamers

You can easily make your own flavored creamers at home. Combine any plant-based milk with natural sweeteners and your favorite spices. Here‚Äôs a simple recipe: mix almond milk with maple syrup and a pinch of cinnamon. This adds not only creaminess but also a delightful twist to your morning coffee. Play around with different flavors such as vanilla, hazelnut, or even mocha to suit your palate.

### 7. Vegan Foam Topping

Missing a frothy topping on your coffee? Use a milk frother with your chosen plant-based milk to create that creamy foam. You can enhance the taste by adding a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon to the frother. This foam adds a caf√©-like experience right in your kitchen and is perfect for topping off lattes and cappuccinos. Depending on your choice of plant milk, you‚Äôll achieve different textures and flavors.

By implementing these creative vegan coffee hacks, you can enjoy a deliciously creamy experience without relying on dairy products. Experiment with these options to find the perfect blend that suits your taste buds while enhancing your coffee ritual. Savor the richness and enjoy your morning brew guilt-free, knowing you‚Äôre making a compassionate choice for both your taste and the planet.

If you have trouble digesting lactose, plant-based milks provide a fantastic alternative. They are naturally lactose-free, allowing you to enjoy your favorite coffee drinks without discomfort. This accessibility means that coffee enjoyment is no longer limited by dietary restrictions.

### Lower in Calories and Fats

While cow's milk can be quite caloric and fatty, many plant-based alternatives offer a lighter option. For instance, unsweetened almond or cashew milk typically has fewer calories than traditional milk. This makes it easier to enjoy your coffee without worrying about calorie overload, especially if you're watching your weight.

### Easy to Find

In recent years, the availability of plant-based milk has skyrocketed. Most grocery stores and coffee shops offer a variety of options, making it accessible for everyone. Whether you‚Äôre at home or stopping by your favorite caf√©, you‚Äôre likely to find a dairy-free option that suits your taste.

I got the nespresso vertuo pop about two months ago and loved it at first. I tried most of the starter pods that come with the machine and then got a sleeve of the sunny almond vanilla. I like it, but I don't love it. I'm an iced (or sometimes hot) latte girl, which worked well with the double shot sunny almond vanilla pods. I want to taste the coffee with a hint of sweet (usually vanilla) to balance out any bitterness.  

Fast forward, I got the single espresso orafio and voltesso to try because I felt like the double shot was giving me ~anxiety~. These are both pretty low intensity... and now my lattes suck - what am I doing wrong!? 

Do I try a higher intensity single shot pod? Go back to double shot pods and not fix what isn't broken? Feeling: discouraged :( ",2,1738949726.0,nespresso,5,1.0,False

Are you actually running your business, or is your business running you?

If your daily routine looks something like this:  
  
‚ùå Drowning in emails before you‚Äôve even had your first coffee.  
‚ùå Juggling client calls, invoices, and social media like a circus act.  
‚ùå Spending hours on admin tasks while your big ideas sit on the back burner.  
‚ùå Working late nights and weekends, telling yourself ""this is just temporary"" (it‚Äôs not).

Then, my friend, you‚Äôre not scaling‚Äîyou‚Äôre stuck in survival mode.

The worst part? It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way.

# 1. You‚Äôre Wasting Hours on $10 Tasks Instead of $1,000 Moves

Time is money, right? Then why are you:  
üì© Sorting emails like it‚Äôs an extreme sport?  
üìÜ Scheduling meetings when automation exists?  
üìä Tracking invoices when someone else could do it in half the time?

Imagine if you reallocated those 20+ hours a week to:  
üöÄ Building strategic partnerships  
üöÄ Closing high-value deals  
üöÄ Developing new revenue streams  
üöÄ Actually taking a break (crazy idea, huh?)

Instead, you‚Äôre spending your time on low-impact, high-drain tasks.

# üí° Solution: Delegate to a [Virtual Assistant ](https://www.wishup.co/service/virtual-assistant)(VA) who can take over these time-sucking tasks while you focus on business growth.

# 2. You‚Äôre ‚ÄúToo Busy‚Äù to Scale ‚Äì And That‚Äôs a Problem

Let‚Äôs play a quick game:

If a new client wanted to work with you tomorrow, could you handle it?

Or would you:  
‚ö†Ô∏è Push them off for a few weeks because you're slammed?  
‚ö†Ô∏è Scramble to fit them in, making everything chaotic?  
‚ö†Ô∏è Drop the ball on existing clients just to make room?

This is why some businesses scale fast while others stay stuck‚Äînot because one works harder, but because one delegates smarter.

# üí° Solution: A Virtual Assistant helps streamline your operations, so your business can scale without breaking you.

# 3. You Think Hiring Full-Time is Your Only Option (It‚Äôs Not)

Look, hiring full-time employees is expensive.

üí∞ Salary costs  
üè¢ Office expenses & software licenses  
üìë HR paperwork, training, and onboarding  
üõë The risk of hiring the wrong person

For startups, solopreneurs, and small businesses, this is a heavy lift‚Äîand completely unnecessary when Virtual Assistants exist.

# üí° Solution: A VA gives you all the benefits of a full-time employee‚Äîwithout the overhead.

‚úÖ No long-term contracts  
‚úÖ No costly hiring process  
‚úÖ Scale up or down as needed

It‚Äôs flexible, affordable, and ridiculously efficient.

# 4. Your Leads Are Falling Through the Cracks

You spend money on ads, optimize your website, and drive traffic‚Äîbut then what?

Leads come in, and‚Ä¶  
üìâ They sit in your inbox for days (oops).  
üìâ You forget to follow up, and they ghost you.  
üìâ Your slow response time hands them to your competitor.

Let‚Äôs be real: Leads expect fast responses. If you‚Äôre too busy, you‚Äôre leaving money on the table.

# üí° Solution: A VA can manage follow-ups, respond to inquiries, and keep your pipeline warm‚Äîso you stop losing revenue due to slow communication.

# 5. Your Business is Thriving‚ÄîBut Are You?

Let‚Äôs check in:  
‚òï Running on coffee and deadlines?  
üì± Glued to your phone on ‚Äúvacation‚Äù?  
üòµ Haven‚Äôt had a stress-free day in‚Ä¶ forever?

Newsflash: Your business isn‚Äôt supposed to consume your entire life.

The most successful entrepreneurs don‚Äôt work harder‚Äîthey delegate smarter.

# üí° Solution: A Virtual Assistant helps you reclaim your time, sanity, and quality of life‚Äîwithout slowing your business down.

# üí° So, What‚Äôs the Next Move?

üî• [Hire a Virtual Assistant](https://www.wishup.co/). üî•

üöÄ Emails? Handled.  
üöÄ Leads? Followed up.  
üöÄ Invoices? Organized.  
üöÄ Your sanity? Restored.

Wishup VAs are pre-vetted, U.S. time-zone aligned, and ready to start in 30 minutes.

So‚Ä¶ are you finally ready to delegate, or should we check back when burnout fully kicks in? üòè

I lost 5 pounds this week!

I was worried that stepping on the scale world make me feel defeated because it wasn't a large amount. I do know 5 pounds is a good start. I'm not sure how much is water weight because I did lose weight before beginning phentermine. 

There arw non scale victories though! I look thinner, i can kind of tell in the mirror. For me to notice it says something. My clothes arw atartinf to fit better. My atomach is getting squishier (which meeans there is less in there)

The ‚Äúhigh‚Äù feeling when I take it has subsided more when I take it.  I still do feel more energy. I have been drinking less coffee. I even went to the gym before having any.  Vv 

I went to the gym 3 days this week.  I have small gym goals, walk a mile and focus on one muscle group. Day one was arms, day two legs, day three stomach. I definitely get sore after, but i don't push it!  

I did get protein shakes from sams club, and they are very helpful! My appetite is back a little more in the evening. I've really loved rotisserie chicken with salad and ranch lately! 

I've been sleeping about the same as before I started, though I feel more rested. 

I'm really trying to focus on the non scale victories over the number and making more sustainable lifestyle changes.

1ik0fno,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/1ik0fno/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 07/02/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of ‚Ç¨1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

* **[SteamRep](https://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198074920693)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

She‚Äôs a nurse and I think this machine was a bit much for her on-the-go life and ‚Äòupgraded‚Äô to a Nespresso machine.

Since we were gifted it, I‚Äôve started getting some tools to dial in my shots. I replaced the stock pressurized portafilter with their brand naked portafilter, a coffee distributor, a spring-loaded tamper, a dosing funnel and WDT tool, a knock box, and a tamp mat. I already owned the Baratza, and I have a precision basket ordered since I fuck with light roast single-origin coffees and I heard precision baskets can help with better extraction for lighter roasts. I store all of my tools in an old Gurkha cigar box.

I‚Äôve seen some people get roasted for their ‚Äúbudget‚Äù setup being too expensive, but I think I did pretty ok. I‚Äôve spent a little under $200 on all of the upgrades and tools, the most expensive being the naked portafilter ($38.99; I specifically wanted the brand that matched my machine) and a handful of items were just under $30 (the distributor, the tamp, and the precision basket). I was gifted my Baratza a few years ago, but that goes for $149.99 and the machine goes for $139.99. I‚Äôve also had my Hario scale for about a decade, my pastry brush was a buck at IKEA, and my wooden bowl for weighing coffee was found at the Target Dollar Spot back when everything was actually a dollar, so overall the setup is a hair over $500.",3,1738948962.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Roasted on Dec 04, 2024, so I‚Äôm in the peak window per their instructions, which have yet to lead me astray yet. Grinder is the Sculptor 078, set to 6. Origami dripper with Sibarist fast flow filters. Filtered water is set to 95C. 15g coffee brewed at 1:16-17. 50g bloom for 1m with 1 swirl to level. Pour the rest in at 6g/s with an additional swirl to level during the draw down. It‚Äôs usually fully drained at 2 minutes. 

The tasting notes are usually very clearly represented, and I‚Äôm used to getting relatively bright acidity up front with rounded fruit sweetness towards the end with this recipe.

I‚Äôm getting a pretty bland cup with this recipe from this roast and have tried adjusting everything I can think of, to no avail. Grinding more finely adds bitterness, and more coarsely it loses body and any of the already subdued flavors I was getting. I don‚Äôt typically mess with water temp as 95 is about as hot as I can take it without adding bitterness. Same with the swirl, any more and it‚Äôs too much agitation; any less, and it‚Äôs not enough to extract anything. 

Thoughts on adjustments? Or do you think this just a case of my palate not liking a roast?

1ik0a75,https://i.redd.it/sptj4jhp3rhe1.jpeg,I recently moved from Breville to Go. Here‚Äôs my first thoughts,"
Once there are a lot of people thinking about the same here I go.

The go looks more solid. Everything, from the portafilter to the baskets, looks robust. No offense, I was happy with the BBE, but know it looks like a toy. 

PID and pressure control are great. I just lost one coffee and now I‚Äôm brewing fine. It‚Äôs a nice feeling dealing with it. 

Heating time: it takes around 5 minutes for the machine to be ready for coffee. You have to flush it once because the fast heating feature requires it. BBE on the other hand was almost immediately (but not perfect). Once the temperature is achieved it‚Äôs solid. I have set it to 92. BBE was this temperature too but I think the Go is warmer.

The Go requires some time for you to change from coffee to milk. It will take around 2 minutes to be ready again. You need to steam it once, wait around 10 seconds, steam again. Buut the pressure is much higher than the BBE. Now I‚Äôm starting to make some latte art better.

Does it make your coffee taste better?
Maybe a little, I think it‚Äôs more cream, the temperature is fine and they‚Äôre more predictable. I never lost any coffee since I‚Äôm using it, they‚Äôre never too acid or too bitter. I‚Äôm still waiting for my new grinder so this I think will make a difference. 

The bad: the space between the portafilter and the tray is small. You will need small cups. 

If you‚Äôre in a hurry and drink too much milk maybe you won‚Äôt like to wait. 

Do I regret? Not at all! It‚Äôs like a 9/10 satisfaction.

1ik0a6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenDogTraining/comments/1ik0a6g/taming_barking_before_the_baby_comes/,Taming barking before the baby comes,"Hello all, I have a 5 month old Samoyed puppy who I love dearly. We certainly didn‚Äôt intend to get pregnant so soon after adopting him as we always planned to have a dog be older than 1 y/o when we have a baby in the house, but here we are  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I know he is still a puppy, and also a chatty breed. My problem isn‚Äôt that he barks, l can handle the occasional barking, and I don‚Äôt mind his barks that are him ‚Äútalking‚Äù to me (the talking barks are lower in pitch). It‚Äôs the specific instances that he barks that are problematic, they are much louder ‚Äúdemand‚Äù barks that I am worried will bother our baby, her ears, and our sanity. Our old dog we were able to train an ‚Äúindoor bark‚Äù volume within a few months, and with our Samoyed he can quiet bark on cue but can‚Äôt translate it into real scenarios no matter what I do. 

Our puppy likes to bark in three specific scenarios: 

1) at our cats - he wants them to play with him and they will have nothing to do with him. I‚Äôve done intervention training with him where I either try and prevent him from barking in the first place, or train him how I would prefer he acts around cats. He gets rewarded when he is not barking at them. But he still loves to bark at the cats. 
2) demanding to be let out of his crate early in the morning - he usually needs to go potty between 5 and 6 am, we take him out and then he gets back into his crate until 7:15. But usually he starts barking at 6:45 and demands to be let out to play. He will bark pretty consistently until it‚Äôs finally 7:15. He gets into too much trouble to allow him to go out unsupervised. He has a chew toy and soft toy in his crate but he just wants out at that point. 

3) demanding to be let outside on a walk immediately in the morning. He does not need to go potty (he goes again right when I let him out of his crate), he just is excited for his morning walk. I have a strict ‚Äúafter mom‚Äôs had breakfast and coffee‚Äù rule which I want to keep up as much as possible because when the baby comes, our mornings will be much more hectic :). 

I know a lot of this is still puppy phase behavior. But our baby is due in August and I would like to minimize this behavior as much as possible before she arrives. I am open to bark collars but also alternative techniques/ training routines I might not be aware of. Any advice you have is much appreciated!

I currently work at a retail craft store as a replenishment (merchandise) manager. My store manager there recently left after 20 years, and is now a store manager at Starbucks. Long story short, he's in need of a shift supervisor and really wants me to take the job. It's like $6/hr more than I'm currently making, but I know there are downsides as well. The job is much farther away from my house (currently live 4 mins away from work, the Starbucks location is 25 mins away). I know absolutely NOTHING about Starbucks, or even coffee in general. I don't drink coffee, I've been inside a Starbucks maybe 3 times in my entire life? 

I have however been a food service manager for many years. I worked food service jobs for 15 years, managed for 10. So I know my way around the food service industry. 

Here's my questions:

I'm not even necessarily looking for a career change, but that kind of money and working with a boss i love is hard to pass up. 

Is it worth it?
What kind of hours do SSVs work? Like what is a normal weeks schedule?
Do you like your job?
Starbucks is a big corporation, do you feel like they treat their employees well?
How difficult would it be for someone with literally ZERO coffee knowledge to learn the job? Is it even feasible?


I don't even know what other questions I should be asking.

I 18 female,  started working during the summer. It was my first summer job. I started working there when I was 17, and after a month, I turned 18. That‚Äôs when a guy approached me. He was Indian and in his early 30s I will call him Tom. I asked people that are frienswith him  about him, and they told me he was super nice, friendly and that he was like a fun dad to tham (yes, these were people around my age). We started talking, and Tom asked me to go out for coffee. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, so I said yes bc at the time he seemed nice and friendly and he always hung out with people my age so it wasnt that alarming. The next day, after work, we went for coffee. I did let my best friend and bf know where i was going and I did shared my location. While driving, he was talking a lot about himself and he did gaster with  his hands, Tom touched my leg a few times while he was talking. I didn‚Äôt say anything and i dint think much of it . The coffee was okay we talked and had a good time. That same evening, he asked me to go out again because he wanted to show me something. It was a cemetery, but it had a beautiful view of the city. We started talking, and he tried to kiss me. Something I didn‚Äôt mention is that I had a boyfriend of three years at the time, and Tom knew about it. This made me uncomfortable, to be honest. About 30 minutes later, we left. He apologized, and I just said, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know how to react. I did tell him about my boundaries and tried to keep my distance, but he kept trying to kiss few more times. Tom even tried to get in bed with me by telling me he wants to show me his apartment, and when he was giving me a tour he took my hand and started leading me to his bed, I told him I needed to do somthing so i left.  At some point, he even found out where I was staying. I tried to leave that relationship  few times by sending him long messages explaining everything, but he would only say, ‚ÄúWe will talk about it,‚Äù and we never did. I didn‚Äôt want to block him because I still had to talk to him at work. At some point, Tom confessed that from the moment he saw me, he knew I was the girl for him and that i have beautiful body and how much he liked me. He even said this in front of our boss (I wasn‚Äôt there), and the boss told him I was still a kid and that he shouldn‚Äôt do anything. Tbh I dint want to belive this was happaning to me. After I left that job, we had a long talk, and he apologized for everything, saying it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. We still kept in touch I gave him benefit of the doubt bc I belived pople can change. When I was in town for my exams witch is close to where I worked,  he came to visit me even though I told him not to. I was trying to be as nice as possible but I still kept my distance. Soon after he left for another country. One day, after he left we were talking, and I told him I wanted to kms. (For context  even before I met Tom, I was in therapy and I struggled with my mental health.) Tom said to me ""You need a big d### to f you so you‚Äôll feel better."" I lost it. We had an argument, and I left. 7 months later, I can say I am doing much better, without him but he is still trying to contact me.

 I told my friends about this, and they were supportive, but some said I was leading him on and that I was the bad guy in this situation bc I dindt said to him not to touche me and that i didnt set boundaries. Witch I tnik is a common sense that you wont touch someone you barely know and 12 years younger? Somthing I feel I  need to say no I didnt wore any reveling outfits. I dont think am a bad guy I just think yes I should have stood my ground and set my boundaries much earlier.

It‚Äôs ridiculous, isn‚Äôt it? To think that fate could be that careless, that it could throw someone into my life for a fleeting moment, only to snatch them away just as quickly. A drunk stranger, tall and completely out of my league, stumbling into my night like some half-written story with no ending. And on my very first night in Perth, no less.

He passed by me twice. The first time, he tried to get my attention by waving his phone, trying to tell me something. I noticed he was handsome, but I'm used to not getting any kind of attention at all, and he was obviously drunk so I avoided eye contact. The second time, we saw him crouched in a street corner, trying to type on his phone. He waved it again as I walked past. I thought that was the last I'd see of him until we decided to eat outside City Kebabs in Murray St near our hotel. We were waiting for our food when I saw him walking unsteadily towards us again, and pulled out a chair from another table. He placed it beside me and sat with me and my family - uninvited but not unwelcome. It turns out he accidentally locked his phone and couldn't get it to open. My uncle told him to just wait there and asked him if he needed anything. He said no - not coffee, not food, not even water. He just laid his head on the table beside me. Every once in a while, he would glance up at me. His eyes found mine, hazy yet intent, like he was trying to remember me in a way that made no sense. Do you know Cabanel's Fallen Angel painting? That's what he looked like to me at the time. It still haunts me up to this day. He barely spoke, just watched, as if he had something to say but couldn‚Äôt find the words through the alcohol clouding his mind. I didn't say a thing.

And maybe that‚Äôs why I let myself wonder. Because if he had been sober, if we had met under different circumstances, maybe he would have said something that mattered. Maybe I would have. Maybe he would have asked for my name, maybe I would have given it to him. Maybe we would have laughed, talked, stayed just a little longer.

But we didn‚Äôt.

He wouldn‚Äôt even have noticed me if he was sober.

That‚Äôs the thought that lingers, the quiet truth I can‚Äôt ignore. If he hadn‚Äôt been drunk, if his world hadn‚Äôt been spinning, if his mind had been sharp and clear, I would have been just another face in the crowd. Just another passing moment in a night he wouldn‚Äôt have thought twice about.

But he wasn‚Äôt sober.

He was careless and unguarded, drawn to me in a way that was probably more about circumstance than choice. His gaze, heavy and lingering, wasn‚Äôt intentional - it was the byproduct of blurred lines and slow thoughts. And I let myself feel something for a second, let myself wonder, because for once, someone was looking at me like I was worth noticing.

And maybe that‚Äôs the saddest part.

Not that he‚Äôs gone, not that I might never see him again, but that I was only worth a second glance because he wasn‚Äôt in his right mind. That, in another reality - one where he was sober and steady - he wouldn‚Äôt have sat down, wouldn‚Äôt have stared, wouldn‚Äôt have existed in my story at all.

I felt something when our eyes met. And now my heart aches at the thought of possibly never seeing him again.

For a fleeting second, it felt like recognition - like something deep and unspoken passed between us. But maybe I‚Äôm just romanticizing a moment that meant nothing. Maybe I just miss the feeling of being noticed.

Because when was the last time someone really looked at me? Not through me, not past me, but at me - as if I mattered, as if I was something worth remembering. Maybe that‚Äôs why I keep replaying it, why I let myself wonder about a stranger who was too drunk to see me clearly.

Eventually, we left him there - locked out of his phone, locked out of whatever this moment could have been. He might wake up tomorrow and not remember me at all. But I will remember him, not for who he was, but for the possibility of what he could have been.

And that will have to be enough.


--

TL;DR:

I met a stranger in Perth - drunk, handsome stranger who might have been something if circumstances had been different. He sat beside me, uninvited but not unwelcome, glancing up every so often like he was trying to remember me.

But he wasn‚Äôt sober. And that‚Äôs the part that lingers.

If he had been, he wouldn‚Äôt have looked at me at all.

Maybe I‚Äôm just romanticizing a fleeting moment. Maybe I just miss being noticed. Either way, he might wake up and forget, but I‚Äôll remember - not him, but the possibility of what could have been.",1,1738947880.0,MissedSoulmates,0,1.0,False

# Understanding the Causes and Effects of Wine Belly

Wine belly, often referred to as beer belly but more commonly associated with regular wine consumption, is a term used to describe the accumulation of fat around the midsection, particularly the abdominal area. This condition can affect both men and women and is often linked to a combination of factors including diet, lifestyle, and genetics. Understanding the causes and effects of wine belly can help individuals make informed decisions about their health and well-being.

One of the primary reasons behind the development of wine belly is the high calorie content in wine. A typical glass of wine contains approximately 125 calories. Over time, consuming multiple glasses of wine regularly can lead to a significant caloric surplus, causing weight gain and fat accumulation around the abdomen. Unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine also contains sugar, which can contribute to increased calorie intake and fat storage.

The type of wine consumed can also play a role in the development of wine belly. Sweet wines, such as dessert wines and some ros√©s, contain higher levels of sugar and can contribute more to weight gain than drier varieties like cabernet sauvignon or pinot noir. Additionally, the frequency of wine consumption is crucial. Drinking wine occasionally may not lead to significant weight gain, but regular consumption, especially in large quantities, can increase the risk of developing wine belly.

Lifestyle choices also contribute significantly to the formation of wine belly. Sedentary lifestyles, lack of physical activity, and poor dietary habits can exacerbate the problem. Consuming wine alongside unhealthy foods, such as fried snacks or fast food, can further increase the likelihood of fat accumulation in the abdominal region. Regular exercise and a balanced diet are essential in maintaining overall health and preventing the development of wine belly.

Genetics also play a role in determining how alcohol affects an individual's body. Some people may be genetically predisposed to store fat more easily around their midsection when consuming alcohol. This genetic factor can make it more challenging for certain individuals to avoid developing wine belly, even with moderate consumption. However, this does not mean that it is impossible to manage; adopting healthy habits can still mitigate these genetic tendencies.

The effects of wine belly extend beyond just the cosmetic concerns of a protruding belly. Excess abdominal fat, including visceral fat, can pose serious health risks. Visceral fat, which lies deep within the abdominal cavity and surrounds internal organs, has been linked to various health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Regular monitoring of waist circumference and overall body composition can help identify potential health risks early on.

To combat wine belly, individuals can take several proactive steps. First, moderating wine consumption is crucial. Limiting the number of glasses per day and choosing lower-calorie options can reduce the caloric intake significantly. regular physical activity into one‚Äôs routine, such as cardio exercises and strength training, can help burn off excess calories and reduce fat accumulation. Eating a balanced diet rich in whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables can also support overall health and weight management.

* Moderate wine consumption to control calorie intake
* Incorporate regular physical activity to burn excess calories
* Eat a balanced diet rich in whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables
* Monitor waist circumference and overall body composition

Understanding the causes and effects of wine belly is the first step towards managing and potentially reversing this condition. By making informed choices about diet and lifestyle, individuals can reduce their risk of developing wine belly and maintain a healthier, more active life. Remember, small changes can lead to significant improvements over time.

# Lifestyle Changes to Reduce Wine Belly

Wine belly, often referred to as beer belly but more common among those who frequently consume alcohol, particularly wine, can be a challenging issue to tackle. It's not just about the extra pounds; it's about understanding how alcohol impacts your body and making necessary lifestyle changes to reduce its effects. Here‚Äôs a guide on how to manage and minimize wine belly through practical adjustments to your daily routine.

# Understanding Wine Belly

Wine belly is primarily caused by excessive alcohol consumption, which leads to fat accumulation around the midsection. Alcohol can increase appetite and lead to poor food choices, contributing to weight gain. Additionally, the liver works overtime to process alcohol, which can slow down metabolism and hinder fat burning.

# Adjust Your Diet

Improving your diet is crucial in reducing wine belly. Start by cutting back on processed foods and opting for whole, nutrient-dense options like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Incorporate more fiber into your meals, as it helps you feel fuller longer and aids digestion. Consider meal planning to avoid impulsive unhealthy choices, especially when you‚Äôre hungry after drinking.

* **Choose Whole Foods:**¬†Opt for fresh fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains.
* **Increase Fiber Intake:**¬†Include foods high in fiber to aid digestion and keep you feeling full.
* **Plan Your Meals:**¬†Prepare meals in advance to avoid unhealthy snacking.

# Exercise Regularly

Regular exercise can significantly help in reducing wine belly. Aim for a mix of cardiovascular activities and strength training. Cardio exercises like running, cycling, or swimming burn calories and boost your metabolism. Strength training builds muscle, which helps in burning more calories even at rest. Consistency is key, so try to incorporate physical activity into your daily routine.

* **Cardiovascular Exercises:**¬†Running, cycling, swimming, or brisk walking.
* **Strength Training:**¬†Incorporate weightlifting or bodyweight exercises to build muscle mass.
* **Consistency:**¬†Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.

# Manage Alcohol Consumption

Reducing alcohol intake is perhaps the most effective way to combat wine belly. Try to limit yourself to one or two drinks a day, or consider going alcohol-free for a few days each week. Opt for lower-calorie alcoholic beverages like light beer or wine spritzers. Drinking water before and during alcohol consumption can also help reduce overall intake and mitigate the impact of alcohol on your body.

* **Limit Drinks:**¬†Stick to one or two drinks per day.
* **Choose Lower-Calorie Options:**¬†Light beer or wine spritzers can be better alternatives.
* **Stay Hydrated:**¬†Drink plenty of water before and during alcohol consumption.

# Improve Sleep Quality

Poor sleep can contribute to weight gain and affect your metabolism. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Establish a consistent sleep schedule, avoid screens before bedtime, and create a relaxing bedtime routine to help improve sleep quality.

* **Consistent Schedule:**¬†Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.
* **Avoid Screens:**¬†Limit screen time before bed to reduce blue light exposure.
* **Relaxing Routine:**¬†Develop a calming bedtime ritual, such as reading or taking a warm bath.

# Reduce Stress Levels

Chronic stress can lead to overeating and poor food choices. Engage in stress-reducing activities like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. These practices can help you manage stress and maintain a healthier relationship with food.

* **Yoga and Meditation:**¬†Practice regularly to manage stress levels.
* **Deep Breathing:**¬†Take short breaks throughout the day to practice deep breathing.
* **Healthy Coping Mechanisms:**¬†Find activities that help you relax and unwind.

# Final Thoughts

Managing wine belly requires a holistic approach that includes dietary changes, regular exercise, controlled alcohol consumption, better sleep, and stress management. By implementing these lifestyle changes, you can reduce the appearance of a wine belly and improve your overall health. Remember, consistency is key, and small steps taken daily can lead to significant results over time.

# The Role of Alcohol in Weight Gain: A Focus on Wine

When you think about weight gain and alcohol, often the first thing that comes to mind is beer bellies. However, the impact of alcohol extends beyond just one type of drink.¬†**Wine**, especially, has its own set of effects on the body, which can lead to a phenomenon known as a¬†**wine belly**. Understanding how alcohol influences weight gain requires looking at both the direct and indirect effects of drinking wine.

**Caloric Content of Wine**

One of the main reasons why wine can contribute to weight gain is its high caloric content. A glass of wine typically contains around 125 calories. While this might not seem like much, over time, these calories can add up. For instance, if you have two glasses of wine every night, that's an additional 250 calories per day. Over a month, this could translate into an extra 7,500 calories, which is equivalent to about 2 pounds of body weight.

**Metabolic Effects**

Alcohol is metabolized differently than other foods and beverages. When you consume alcohol, your body prioritizes its metabolism over other macronutrients like carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. This means that while your body is burning off the alcohol, it‚Äôs not effectively burning fat. As a result, excess calories from food may get stored as fat, contributing to weight gain.

**Sugar Content**

Some wines, particularly sweet varieties like dessert wines, contain significant amounts of sugar. This added sugar can spike blood glucose levels, leading to increased insulin production. High insulin levels can promote fat storage, especially around the midsection. This is where the term¬†**wine belly**¬†comes from‚Äîaccumulated fat around the abdominal area due to regular consumption of sugary wines.

**Inhibition of Appetite Control**

Another factor contributing to weight gain from wine is its effect on appetite control. Alcohol can disrupt the hormones that regulate hunger and satiety, such as ghrelin and leptin. This disruption can lead to overeating, especially during or after drinking sessions. Additionally, many people tend to pair wine with calorie-dense foods like cheese, charcuterie, and desserts, further increasing their caloric intake.

**Behavioral Factors**

The social aspect of drinking wine can also play a role in weight gain. Often, wine is consumed during relaxed, social occasions like dinners or gatherings. These settings can encourage more eating and less physical activity. Moreover, the habit of drinking wine regularly can become a routine, making it harder to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regimen.

**Strategies to Mitigate Weight Gain**

To enjoy wine without the risk of gaining a¬†**wine belly**, consider implementing some strategies:

* **Monitor Your Portions:**¬†Stick to one glass of wine per day. Using smaller glasses can help control portion sizes.
* **Choose Dry Wines:**¬†Opt for dry wines, which generally have lower sugar content compared to sweeter varieties.
* **Eat Healthily:**¬†Pair your wine with nutrient-dense foods like vegetables and lean proteins rather than high-calorie snacks.
* **Stay Active:**¬†Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine to offset the caloric intake from wine.
* **Stay Hydrated:**¬†Drink water between glasses of wine to stay hydrated and reduce the likelihood of overindulging.

**Final Thoughts**

While wine can certainly contribute to weight gain, understanding its effects allows you to make informed choices. By being mindful of portion sizes, choosing healthier options, and staying active, you can continue enjoying wine without the unwanted side effects. Remember, moderation is key, and a balanced lifestyle is the best way to enjoy life‚Äôs pleasures, including a glass of fine wine, without compromising your health goals.

# Dietary Adjustments to Combat the Expansion of Wine Belly

Wine belly, often associated with frequent consumption of alcoholic beverages like wine, can lead to an accumulation of fat around the midsection. This isn't just a cosmetic issue; it can also indicate potential health risks. If you're looking to combat the expansion of wine belly, making dietary adjustments is a crucial step. Here are some effective strategies to help you manage and reduce this belly fat.

# Understanding Wine Belly

Wine belly is a term used to describe the belly fat that accumulates due to excessive alcohol consumption, particularly wine. Alcohol is high in calories and can disrupt the body's metabolism, leading to weight gain, especially around the midsection. Understanding how alcohol impacts your body can help you make informed dietary choices.

# Calorie Reduction

* **Limit Alcohol Intake:**¬†Reducing the amount of wine you consume is the first step. Opt for lower-calorie alternatives like light beer or sparkling water with a splash of fruit juice.
* **Choose Healthier Drinks:**¬†When you do drink, choose drinks with fewer calories. For instance, opt for dry wines over sweet ones, as they contain fewer carbohydrates and sugars.

# Balanced Diet

* **Increase Fiber Intake:**¬†Eating more fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes can help you feel fuller longer and reduce overall calorie intake.
* **Protein-Rich Foods:**¬†lean proteins such as chicken, fish, tofu, and legumes into your diet can boost metabolism and help maintain muscle mass, which is essential for burning calories.

# Portion Control

* **Be Mindful of Portions:**¬†Overeating, even healthy foods, can contribute to weight gain. Use smaller plates and bowls to control portion sizes.
* **Avoid Late-Night Snacking:**¬†Eating late at night can lead to undigested calories being stored as fat. Try to finish your last meal of the day at least three hours before bedtime.

# Hydration

* **Drink Plenty of Water:**¬†Staying hydrated is crucial. Drinking water before meals can help you eat less and feel fuller faster.
* **Limit Sugary Beverages:**¬†Replace sugary sodas and juices with water, herbal teas, or unsweetened coffee. These changes can significantly reduce your daily calorie intake.

# Regular Exercise

* **Incorporate Cardio:**¬†Activities like running, cycling, or swimming can help burn off excess calories and reduce belly fat.
* **Add Strength Training:**¬†Building muscle through strength training can increase your metabolic rate, helping you burn more calories throughout the day.

# Healthy Snacking

* **Opt for Nutritious Snacks:**¬†Choose snacks that are low in calories and high in nutrients, such as nuts, seeds, yogurt, or fresh fruit.
* **Avoid Processed Foods:**¬†Processed snacks tend to be high in sugar and unhealthy fats. Opt for whole foods instead.

# Mindful Eating

* **Eat Slowly:**¬†Taking time to chew your food thoroughly and savor each bite can help you eat less and enjoy your meals more.
* **Avoid Distractions:**¬†Eating while distracted by screens or other activities can lead to overeating. Focus on your food and enjoy the flavors.

# Support System

* **Find a Buddy:**¬†Having a friend or family member who supports your goals can make it easier to stick to your plan.
* **Join a Group:**¬†Consider joining a support group or fitness class to stay motivated and accountable.

Making these dietary adjustments can help combat the expansion of wine belly. Remember, consistency is key. Small changes made regularly can lead to significant improvements in your overall health and appearance. By focusing on a balanced diet, regular exercise, and mindful eating habits, you can work towards reducing belly fat and achieving a healthier lifestyle.

# Exercise Routines Tailored for Shrinking Wine Belly

When it comes to tackling a wine belly, incorporating targeted exercise routines can significantly help. A wine belly, often associated with excess abdominal fat, can develop due to various factors including poor diet, lack of physical activity, and even genetics. By focusing on exercises that target the core and overall body fat, you can start seeing improvements in your physique. Here‚Äôs a comprehensive guide to exercise routines tailored specifically for shrinking a wine belly.

# Understanding the Wine Belly

A wine belly is a term used to describe excess fat accumulation around the midsection, often more pronounced around the lower abdomen. This type of fat, known as visceral fat, can pose health risks if left unchecked. While reducing a wine belly requires a combination of diet and exercise, targeted workouts can play a crucial role in achieving your goals.

# Cardiovascular Exercises

Cardiovascular exercises are essential for burning overall body fat, which includes the fat around your midsection. regular cardio into your routine can help reduce the size of your wine belly. Some effective cardio exercises include:

* **Brisk Walking:**¬†Start with brisk walking for 30 minutes a day, gradually increasing the duration and intensity.
* **Jogging:**¬†Aim for 20-30 minutes of jogging three to four times a week.
* **Cycling:**¬†Whether outdoors or on a stationary bike, cycling is great for cardiovascular health.
* **Swimming:**¬†A full-body workout that‚Äôs gentle on the joints and effective for fat loss.

# Core Strengthening Exercises

While spot reduction isn‚Äôt possible, strengthening your core muscles can help tighten and tone the abdominal area. Focus on exercises that engage multiple muscle groups to maximize calorie burn. Some effective core-strengthening exercises include:

* **Planks:**¬†Hold a plank position for 20-30 seconds, gradually increasing the time as you build strength.
* **Bicycle Crunches:**¬†Perform 3 sets of 15-20 repetitions, alternating sides.
* **Leg Raises:**¬†Lie flat on your back and raise your legs to a 90-degree angle, then slowly lower them without touching the floor. Aim for 3 sets of 15 repetitions.
* **Mountain Climbers:**¬†This dynamic exercise works your core while elevating your heart rate. Do 3 sets of 30 seconds each.

# Strength Training

Including strength training in your routine helps increase muscle mass, which in turn boosts your metabolism and aids in fat loss. Full-body workouts are particularly effective for targeting overall body fat. Consider these strength training exercises:

* **Squats:**¬†Perform 3 sets of 12-15 reps to work your legs and glutes.
* **Lunges:**¬†Add lunges to your routine, aiming for 3 sets of 12-15 reps per leg.
* **Push-Ups:**¬†If standard push-ups are too challenging, start with knee push-ups. Aim for 3 sets of 10-15 reps.
* **Dumbbell Rows:**¬†Use dumbbells to perform rows, which target your back and shoulders. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps per arm.

# Yoga and Pilates

Both yoga and Pilates offer numerous benefits for reducing a wine belly. These practices focus on flexibility, core strength, and mindfulness, contributing to overall fitness and wellness. Incorporate these exercises into your weekly routine:

* **Warrior Pose:**¬†This pose strengthens your legs and core while improving balance.
* **Bridge Pose:**¬†Target your glutes and lower back muscles, promoting core stability.
* **Rolling Like a Ball:**¬†A Pilates move that engages your entire core, helping to flatten the belly.
* **Teaser:**¬†Another Pilates exercise that challenges your core and improves posture.

# Combining Diet and Exercise

No matter how effective your exercise routine is, combining it with a healthy diet is key to shrinking a wine belly. Focus on eating whole foods, lean proteins, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Avoid processed foods and excessive sugars, which can contribute to fat accumulation. Drinking plenty of water also helps flush out toxins and keep you hydrated.

# Consistency and Patience

Reducing a wine belly takes time and consistent effort. Be patient with your progress and stay committed to your routine. Celebrate small victories along the way, and remember that every little bit counts. Consistency is crucial‚Äîaim to exercise most days of the week and maintain a balanced diet.

By integrating these exercise routines into your lifestyle, you can effectively tackle a wine belly and achieve a healthier, more toned midsection. Remember, the journey to a flatter belly involves both diet and exercise, so stay motivated and focused on your goals.

# Conclusion

Making informed choices about your alcohol consumption and lifestyle can significantly impact your waistline. By understanding how wine contributes to weight gain and adopting healthier habits, you can manage and reduce the appearance of a wine belly. Opt for a balanced diet rich in whole foods and limit your wine intake. Regular exercise, especially activities targeting the abdominal area, can further aid in shrinking the belly fat. Remember, small changes over time can lead to big results. Prioritize your health by making conscious decisions about what you eat and drink. With persistence and the right approach, you can enjoy wine while maintaining a trim and healthy figure.",1,1738947639.0,SipCity,0,1.0,False

I feel devastated because under no circumstances would I ever do anything to harm her in anyway, and now she views me as a terrible, predatory type of ex. Her main reasoning being that she disagreed with my opinion on sex being reciprocal and mutual beneficial for both parties. This might be a little too TMI, but while having sex I had made her finish then cleaned her up. After that, thinking that sex should be reciprocal and mutual beneficial for both parties, I made the mistake of saying ‚Äúmy turn‚Äù. Admittedly, in retrospect it sounds kinda bad and selfish, but in the setting and the pace of our intercourse it seemed fine in the moment. (For context, she was hyping up this night for a while because she had just finished her cycle and we had both cancelled our plans with our friends to have this special night. Also, she brought over a mystery bag of a bunch of sex toys‚Ä¶so it seemed she was super into this freaky night.) She didn‚Äôt say anything in the moment and then seemed happy to continue. Only about 15 mins later I could tell that she wasn‚Äôt enthusiastic as she was at the start so I asked her if she was ok and if she wanted to continue. She said no and I didn‚Äôt question it, wasn‚Äôt disappointed that we had to stop, and didn‚Äôt ask twice. She put her show on and I fell asleep in 5 mins.

**What is the Book about?**

Tao is an immigrant fortune teller, traveling between villages with just her trusty mule for company. She only tells ‚Äúsmall‚Äù fortunes: whether it will hail next week; which boy the barmaid will kiss; when the cow will calve. She knows from bitter experience that big fortunes come with big consequences‚Ä¶

Soon, they‚Äôre joined by a baker with a knead for adventure, and‚Äîof course‚Äîa slightly magical cat.

Tao sets down a new path with companions as big-hearted as her fortunes are small. But as she lowers her walls, the shadows of her past are closing in‚Äîand she‚Äôll have to decide whether to risk everything to preserve the family she never thought she could have.

**My thoughts while reading it**

If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned from books with intriguing titles, it‚Äôs that they set up expectations.¬†*The Teller of Small Fortunes*¬†promised a story built on charming, whimsical divinations‚Äîlittle fortunes that, in their own curious way, shape lives in unexpected but delightful ways. I imagined an atmosphere where tiny prophecies found in coffee grounds or scattered tea leaves would nudge people into heartwarming, if slightly absurd, situations. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not quite what I got.

The core premise had potential. The idea of a fortune teller whose predictions come in small, seemingly inconsequential ways could have been the perfect foundation for a cosy fantasy‚Äîsomething light, filled with quirky characters and unexpected joys. But instead of a gentle, meandering story of intertwined fates, the book leaned into a more stripped-down quest structure. Now, I usually enjoy a good quest story, but this one was poorly executed and far from cosy. Our protagonist, Tao, packs up her tent, gathers her ragtag team of unlikely companions, and sets off on an adventure to find a missing daughter. While this setup isn‚Äôt inherently bad, it lacked a fresh twist to keep it engaging.

The cast had promise. Tao, the fortune teller, is more of a wandering mystic than a showman, and her powers are subtle, almost underwhelming. Then there‚Äôs Mash, a hardened warrior and the desperate father searching for his lost daughter, who at first comes across as cold and ruthless but has layers of grief beneath his stern demeanour. His companion, Silt, is a former thief struggling to leave his past behind, and while his dynamic with Mash hints at an interesting ‚Äúgrumpy father ‚Äì naive son‚Äù dynamic, it never fully develops. And finally, we have Kina, a young woman who works as a baker for her uncle but has the unfortunate talent of creating the most ugly pastries imaginable. On paper, this should have been a rich tapestry of personalities, but somehow, none of them truly came to life. Their struggles and arcs felt underdeveloped, their interactions lacking the spark that makes you truly invest in their fates. Also the interaction between these characters is very underdeveloped, so you don‚Äôt get this found family trope, what I‚Äôve hoped for.

Ultimately, the book never quite delivered on what its title suggested.

Instead, it was neither fully cosy nor fully adventurous, leaving it in an awkward middle ground where it never truly found its footing. A promising premise, but a missed opportunity.

1ijzmzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ijzmzo/aio_for_not_feeling_affection_for_my_neice/,AIO for not feeling affection for my neice?,"A long one, sorry. 

I can't help but be annoyed with her & I feel like a dick about it as an adult. I raised my nephew and my little brother. They are 2 years apart in age and came to me when I was 17 & they were 3 & 5 originally (both parents got care back for a very short time and failed again) - my brother (Dads son but both children were living with my brother & his long term partner - both had addiction abuse issues, my Dad is an abusive alcoholic who my mother left when myself and my 2 siblings were much younger) was harder to raise because he was older and saw more - so we had a few little clashes, like not showering when asked and just a fewpush back behaviours at 13 - nothing serious. He sometimes aggravated me, but nothing like what my neice does. Both boys have amazing manners. So I'm unsure if this is some subconscious jealousy, even on my behalf. 
I don't feel jealous, just persistently aggravated. 

The 2 boys are older now, made successes of their lives (working and self sufficient) and live out of home at 19 & 21 (not far away from me & often visit). 

I became very emotionally burnt out in recent times. I've been an emotional caretaker for my mother, general caretaker for the boys, and both friends and other family members. I recently flew across states to housesit for my well-off sister & her dogs. This gave me some time alone while she was away. 
She has a 16yr old who's father is also an abusive narcissistic/drinker. 

She's 2 weeks on 2 weeks off with her Mom and father. 

Now this girl plays up every issue she has - self diagnoses (BPD, ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, chronic joint issues, Heart Issues) I actually DO have Heart issues(surgery required), ADHD (can't be medicated)  depression & anxiety (diagnosed) and I've got a collagen deficiency that affects my joints and it only seems that as soon as she heard I had these she had them. She even made her mother take her to get ADHD diagnoses (after researching the symptoms).  I haven't been  a HUGE part of her life except for a few holidays and visits, etc.

She has been mirroring everything I do and some other things the kids do at school. People she admires or wants to be??
Her father's family talks absolute shit about my sister and she was present for SOME of her father's emotional abuse - I will NEVER take away from what effect that has one children (Experiencing it myself, I gave a lot of benefit of the doubt.) but she still goes there and listens to it.
She often talks disparagingly about her father and at first wanted nothing to do with him. Except her father and his family are rich. Like really
well off. 
 
I slept horribly at my sisters and one day had to gather the strength to go on a clothing shopping trip I really didn't want to go on. It was crowded and I've been getting really easily overwhelmed  & I hate shopping in general (I hate this as I was always good at moderating my moods) my neice kept at me and I told her this. 
Minutes later She went and found my sister, and all of a sudden, we had to leave, ""as [Blank] was overwhelmed and hated shopping.""
I benefited, so I noted it but didn't care. 

I mentioned some brain fog. Now, she keeps mentioning her brain fog.
My sister is well off, and it's actually costs me way more to housesit than I anticipated. 


I clean and cook as my sister doesn't much. I stopped after a period and just tidied my mess. 
Now eating certain foods is now her thing (i.e., Eating fresh tomatoes like apples). 

Every treat I buy myself,  my neice eats without asking.
She just helps herself. A box of biscuits I got 1 out of. I shared a few the night I opened them, but I didn't give any permission to help herself, and when I went back, they were gone. 
Cured meats and cheeses she just wants as snacks. A WHOLE bar of chocolate and a bag of chocolates - I didn't get any of these things. My iced coffee. 
My sister has overcorrected and let's her have freedom because of our childhood. However, she hardly ever kept in contact with her mother until I've  been around. Finally messaging her daily because I did find it a little odd my sister would text her and it would take her DAYS to reply if at all and she was with a known abuser and his family is participating In a bit of parental alienation but accusing my sister of doing it. 

She has the WORST hygiene I've ever come across, not washing for days and genuinely being pungent. I was sitting next to her on the couch, and she lifted her leg, and this God awful smell wafted. 
She won't grab toilet paper, even noting to me there was none but still not refilling the roll holder by the toilet. She used a baby wipe and left it on the floor. I bagged the bin, and she left a pad on the top of the bag, not inside. She left her used floss (when she DOES brush her teeth) on some of my things on the counter. There was some used toilet paper (unsure what it was used for, but it didn't look horrible, however) on the counter. She never puts her dishes in the dishwater, just leaving them in the sink.

The temperature was really high at the time 115¬∞F and she went to school, didn't shower or brush her teeth, then went to school the next day and then didn't wash again until the next day. 

My neice also told me she ""charms some of her teacher which doesn't always afford her a grading bias but they tend to help her more than the other children."" She has mentioned a few things that lean toward manipulation of people. She has said to me, ""You mirror them. That's how you get them."" When talking about an ex boyfriend She had in casual conversation.  

She's meant to be ""gifted"" and didn't take her medication for 2 months during the school holidays. When she got back on them she wouldn't shut up, including risking our lives on a driving lesson and extended a 35 minute drive to an hour because she ""knew where she was going"" but just kept going on about herself and ignoring instructions, delaying other drivers at turns and roundabouts. I've never been beeped at so much in life (which annoys me because I hate panicking or pressuring learner drivers in general, give them a break they could hurt themselves or someone else when they're highly anxious). 
Not to mention the free counselling & the school drive taking 2 1/2 hours out of my day. 

My sister has been pushing me to move with them and seeming has a hero complex, but there other things bothering me about this situation that aren't down to my neice but that's another issue. 

I really have this block with this child and she's a child, so I feel absolutely awful feeling this way. 
She is stubtley rude in many ways too, and her trying to ""joke"" is ""messing with me."" However, I come from a family of straight faced, rude jokers, and this isnt that. 

Am I being a COMPLETE asshole here?

Added note which I feel is relevant - the dog's have only just been recently handed over by my sisters husband (he used the as controlling tools, and she fought in court to get them back). When they arrived they were in a really bad condition.. sore, unwashed fat or unhealthy (unwalked) , infected and too long nails, but my neice was at this house with them for 2 weeks each time. 
She doesn't walk them when she's at her Mom's. I'd done it more than both of them tbf but my sister works full time.

Note 2.
They're both kind of pressuring me in ways regarding moving. They both did not consider my life in my hometown, me having to go back to employment and my other family. I was considering it in the beginning, and my neice put it on me about going back, and I feel awful that despite the opportunity it may provide no longer wanting to.

*‚ÄúIn the evenings, when they sat a table near the hearth eating fresh-baked bread with stewed turnips for supper, Tao let the others carry the conversation and enjoyed the novelty of simply being part of a group with nothing expected of her but her presence.‚Äù*  
  
**What is the Book about?**  
  
Tao is an immigrant fortune teller, traveling between villages with just her trusty mule for company. She only tells ‚Äúsmall‚Äù fortunes: whether it will hail next week; which boy the barmaid will kiss; when the cow will calve. She knows from bitter experience that big fortunes come with big consequences‚Ä¶  
  
Even if it‚Äôs a lonely life, it‚Äôs better than the one she left behind. But a small fortune unexpectedly becomes something more when a (semi) reformed thief and an ex-mercenary recruit her into their desperate search for a lost child. Soon, they‚Äôre joined by a baker with a knead for adventure, and‚Äîof course‚Äîa slightly magical cat.  
  
Tao sets down a new path with companions as big-hearted as her fortunes are small. But as she lowers her walls, the shadows of her past are closing in‚Äîand she‚Äôll have to decide whether to risk everything to preserve the family she never thought she could have.

**My thoughts while reading it**  
  
***If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned from books with intriguing titles, it‚Äôs that they set up expectations. The Teller of Small Fortunes promised a story built on charming, whimsical divinations‚Äîlittle fortunes that, in their own curious way, shape lives in unexpected but delightful ways. I imagined an atmosphere where tiny prophecies found in coffee grounds or scattered tea leaves would nudge people into heartwarming, if slightly absurd, situations. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not quite what I got.***  
  
The core premise had potential. The idea of a fortune teller whose predictions come in small, seemingly inconsequential ways could have been the perfect foundation for a cosy fantasy‚Äîsomething light, filled with quirky characters and unexpected joys. But instead of a gentle, meandering story of intertwined fates, the book leaned into a more stripped-down quest structure. Now, I usually enjoy a good quest story, but this one was poorly executed and far from cosy. Our protagonist, Tao, packs up her tent, gathers her ragtag team of unlikely companions, and sets off on an adventure to find a missing daughter. While this setup isn‚Äôt inherently bad, it lacked a fresh twist to keep it engaging.  
  
The cast had promise. Tao, the fortune teller, is more of a wandering mystic than a showman, and her powers are subtle, almost underwhelming. Then there‚Äôs Mash, a hardened warrior and the desperate father searching for his lost daughter, who at first comes across as cold and ruthless but has layers of grief beneath his stern demeanour. His companion, Silt, is a former thief struggling to leave his past behind, and while his dynamic with Mash hints at an interesting ‚Äúgrumpy father ‚Äì naive son‚Äù dynamic, it never fully develops. And finally, we have Kina, a young woman who works as a baker for her uncle but has the unfortunate talent of creating the most ugly pastries imaginable. On paper, this should have been a rich tapestry of personalities, but somehow, none of them truly came to life. Their struggles and arcs felt underdeveloped, their interactions lacking the spark that makes you truly invest in their fates. Also the interaction between these characters is very underdeveloped, so you don‚Äôt get this found family trope, what I‚Äôve hoped for.  
  
The worldbuilding, while functional, did little to stand out. Cosy fantasy doesn‚Äôt necessarily require wildly original settings, but there has to be something that gives it heart. If I compare it to The Spellshop‚Äîwhich, despite not being a personal favourite, at least had a sense of warmth and charm and really cute and unique creatures‚ÄîThe Teller of Small Fortunes fell flat. The classic fantasy obstacles felt too familiar: a troll guarding a bridge, a phoenix protecting its egg. How worn out are these things, please? Without a unique spin, they were more obligatory hurdles than memorable encounters.

But if what happens doesn‚Äôt make sense because it would never happen in real life, even with all the possible happy endings, then at the end you just ask yourself why?

1ijzk94,https://i.redd.it/bb7zxnwiyqhe1.jpeg,Should I use my motion logo in email marketing campaigns?,"Email marketing‚Äî You finally got yourself a sleek motion logo. It‚Äôs crisp, it‚Äôs dynamic, it‚Äôs everything you dreamed of. And now you‚Äôre thinking: Should I put this masterpiece in my email campaigns?

Let‚Äôs break it down.


---

Hooking Attention: A Motion Logo‚Äôs Superpower

Imagine this: Your email lands in the inbox. Instead of a boring static image, BOOM‚Äîa logo that elegantly animates, subtly catching the eye. It‚Äôs smooth. It‚Äôs mesmerizing. It makes the recipient pause for just a second longer.

And in the email marketing world, one second is the difference between a sale and getting ghosted.

It‚Äôs like showing up to a party in a designer suit versus your old college hoodie. The animation says, We‚Äôre modern, we‚Äôre cutting-edge, and no, we don‚Äôt use Comic Sans.


---

The Dark Side: When Motion Goes Wrong

Now, let‚Äôs not get carried away. Motion logos in emails can backfire faster than a boomerang.

Not All Email Clients Play Nice ‚Äì Some email providers block GIFs or animations. Instead of a smooth transition, your masterpiece might look like a frozen frame of disappointment.

File Size Matters ‚Äì A motion logo that‚Äôs too large can slow down loading times. And let‚Äôs be honest, nobody has the patience for an email that loads like it‚Äôs on 2003 dial-up.

The Distraction Factor ‚Äì If your logo is doing a full Broadway performance, the reader might forget why they even opened your email in the first place.


It‚Äôs like putting fireworks in a PowerPoint presentation‚Äîcool, but is it necessary?


---

The Best Approach: Motion, But Make It Smart

So, should you use a motion logo in your email campaigns? The answer: Yes, but don‚Äôt go overboard.

Use subtle animations ‚Äì A simple fade-in, a slight bounce, or a light shimmer can be elegant and engaging.

Optimize file size ‚Äì Keep it under 200KB so it loads faster than your customer‚Äôs morning coffee.

Test before sending ‚Äì Some email clients (looking at you, Outlook) handle animations worse than a potato. Make sure it displays properly everywhere.



---

Final Verdict: Motion Logos‚ÄîA Marketing Flex or a Risky Click?

A motion logo in an email is like a well-timed joke. Done right, it grabs attention and leaves an impression. Done wrong, and‚Ä¶ well, now your audience is confused, and your email is in the spam folder.

So go ahead, flex that animated logo‚Äîbut keep it smooth, smart, and subtle. Otherwise, you might just give someone a reason to unsubscribe‚Ä¶ including your mom.

After a long career of just observing and being a specialty coffee shop visitor, I got lucky on my birthday and got this beauty as a present from my wife.

I have tried to do make a double espresso couple of times following one of the most basic yt tutorials about this very machine.

My noob questions:
1. Do I always need to rinse the water ( with turning the brew mode on and empty glass under ) for 150ml after turning the machine on?

2. Do you always turn off the machine after making coffee or you keep it on throughout the day? Just curious about this one because it takes ~10 min for it to heat it up at least as per the tutorial.

3. How long should the brewing be? I am using the standard portafilter with the ‚Äúinfusion‚Äù pin and my espresso or double espresso usually are closer to the quantity and consistence of americano? Should I stop the brew mode quicker?

P.S. The beans were grinded at the local coffee shop with specifically requesting for a suitable grind for this machine.

I'm an idiot, I quickly found out. Every time I read a cruel one my head thought it was from you to me. So I thought this might be therapeutic or something similar, though I still don't trust in things of a therapeutic nature.

I think I got a little addicted to making you laugh. Please understand that it wasn't intentional. I wouldn't have minded keeping my distance, but I'm sure whatever magnetic trait you had possessed remains still. Please don't use that power so cruelly on the next person you find interesting.

It felt as though I was your whole world at times and I know you knew that. I don't know how you did it. Over and over I'm a deeply mistrusting person.  
I didn't know who I was, but you knew what you were. At least the parts that counted. I don't think we knew what *we* were, but maybe that's still na√Øve of me. I don't have a definition for you in my mind, you're just this thing that's clung to me ever since.

The kindness you had wasn't constant, sometimes you were even cruel, and I'm afraid being kept in the dark made me a lovesick slobbering dog. I think of our time together as sunny and painful. Thinking of you even now makes my chest heavy. I think that weighted thing is my heart, the only time I've ever really felt it, and you've made the sensation painful.

The worst part is I still feel tricked by you. I still don't know whether it was my own fault or yours. Whether you got bored of me; or you didn't and I just got scared. I can't look back and judge myself critically anymore.  
I think back then I was a terrible person. I know I tried to sculpt who I was *for* you when we got close. But then, that fakeness was the closest thing I'd ever had to anything true.

I'm sorry for making you feel as though I could never hurt you. I could. I think those cruel words were the only honest ones between us towards the end, and everyone deserves honesty. What that all came from was a desire to see you happy, and I think you're the only person I've ever wanted to see happy. If that ever happens again I hope that it won't turn out to be so much of a mess.

I think now, because of you, I'm less of a terrible person.  
I'm judging and angry at things, but at least I'm me. At least I'm honest. I don't think I'll ever get addicted to a narcissist again. Life has tossed me around a bit since then, and I've let it pass me by and I've sped towards collision. I've been self destructive and terrible to myself. I've felt I've been everything I can be since then (which is horribly, awfully bipolar) and hopefully that chaos will one day find actual order.

I don't know. I'm sorry. Or I'm not sorry. I'm afraid you've made me a *better* mess. It's just... sometimes I get this nagging notion that I'd want to know what you'd think about this or that. Fuck you if you liked that I needed you. I don't now. But I wouldn't mind grabbing a coffee if you ever asked to meet again.",4,1738946365.0,UnsentLetters,4,1.0,False
1ijz9h4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ijz9h4,Finally decided to add some lore,"Thank you MoffetiArtist for this beautiful artwork

Lore: He is a human who traded his head for the power of the Watcher, he uses it to judge and destroy unworthy lifeforms, they have a symbiotic relationship where the host gets the crowns powers and the crown gets partial control and gets to do his job as a watcher more efficiently.

The relationship works by severing the hosts physical bonds and restrictions and making a stronger soul bond where they share the same mind-scape, most hosts can‚Äôt handle the amount of information and they decay, but some like Note are strong minded enough to withstand it.

The hosts name is Note and the crowns name is Calamorn. They communicate telepathically because no head(duh).

His powers are even stronger than gods because he is the one who judges every living thing and that includes them, he can easily level a solar system and kill gods.

His powers include: Omnipotence(he is all powerful), omniscient(he knows everything because he watches everything), Foresight(he can see into the future and knows all your next moves, even in other universes).

Weaknesses include: Hitting him in the eye, ruining his suit(he gets mad), he also can‚Äôt hurt People that don‚Äôt pose a threat to the flow of the universe.

Things Calamorn likes: Other watchers, calm intelligent individuals, void coffee(it‚Äôs coffee made from void), Books in his infinite library.

Things Calamorn dislikes: Things that make no sense, his host(they try to hide it but they have a sibling relationship), fuzzy animals.

Things Note likes: Calamorn, void coffee(he does not know what it tastes like, it just feels familiar. . .), Other people(when he became a host he stopped meeting people because he spends all his time in the Watchers domain), fuzzy animals(they are so cute).

Things Note dislikes: Nothing really.

Personality: Calamorn is stoic and easily annoyed while note has a more fun inviting demeanor, Calamorn can only speak in cursed speech like TÃµÕåÕïhÃ∏ÃÑÕéiÃ¥ÃõÕîsÃµÃäÃ∞ while Note just speaks normally.

They spend most of their time in the Watchers domain watching the universe and eradicating threats to it.",5,1738946358.0,RobloxAvatars,6,1.0,False

The humility and humanity of my fellow country folk.
The respect and compassion to treat people like dignified human beings.

What happened to us? Do you look in the mirror and recognize the person you see? What leads people to *really* feel the way they feel?

Millions of divided people, and for what? What happened to maintaining dialogue and understanding? Everybody has their biases, but what is the point of being a unified nation if not to learn and grow together? What is preventing YOU from taking the steps to grow?

There is no progress in stagnancy, no growth in the rejection of the future, and no compassion in division.

Can we stop drawing arbitrary lines that only seek to halt our own ability to grow? Can we stop basing our lives around politicians? Directing anger at fellow humans who just seek to grow and live? Can we NOT take every single word that comes out of lawmakers mouths like gospel without doing our own due diligence in verifying the reality? I wish people would stop putting all of their energy into systems that have demonstrated time and time again to not give a single shit about ANY of us. 

Gender? Immigrants? Left Vs Right? All of these red herrings that only serve to take away attention from the root of the problem.

I don‚Äôt care about political affiliation, I don‚Äôt care about culture wars, and I don‚Äôt care to be stuck in a loop of learned helplessness. 

I miss Canada, but I believe in its people. I believe in the vision of a place of community and compassion. A country free of prejudice against others for their existence. A country which fosters knowledge and understanding, before hatred and malice.

And it is bot like we talk daily. We used to text quite often but sometimes there is a gap. And this drove me off. So now we dont text all that often. He is hot and cold. I was very invested initially but this hot an cold behaviour, and these gaps in talking pushed me away. And I am not all that invested now. For me consistency is key. I like to talk daily but not much but atleast a 2 min convo. We went out for coffee and We held hands and he said he felt like kissing me and that he wanted to kiss me a few times. But I politely declined. Because though we have known each other for the past couple of years, we have only started flirting and talking well now.

Like, he comes off so strong and then just vanishes or acts so cooly like nothing happened at all. I tried to call him that day and he was out and said we will catch up later.

This is my first post in this group, as I also want to inspire new people to try this awesome and fascinating experience.

I'm a 46 years old man (1m83, 85 Kgs), who practices martial arts on one side, but who also likes to enjoy life on the other side (I love to eat and I drink alcohol every weekend). My life philosophy is to maintain a permanent balance between health and pleasures. I have started intermittent fasting (16 hours 6 days per week + 24 hours 1 day per week) a few years ago and have stopped alcohol 15 days ago for 1 month in order to experience my first zero calories (only coffee, tea, 3,5 liter water per day and electrolytes) fast of 6 days. 

Here is my personal feedback on the different days :

Day 1 : As I do this every week since a few years, it was a normal day for me. 

Day 2 : My martial arts training was awesome, even better than usually and I was full of energy. My concentration at work was also unchanged, which surprised me. 

Day 3 : The day at the office went fine, but I noticed that I was more irritable. My martial arts training was awesome however, like the day before. In the evening, I had a weak moment, as there was a wonderful smell in the kitchen and my son tried to make me quit by putting his plate below my nose and telling me how awesome it was. When I went to bed, I had a feeling of hunger and cold, but I had enough willpower to overcome it. I suppose that this was my first day in autophagy.

Day 4 : Everything was fine but I noticed that I was more sensible to food smell, even from the outside of houses during my daily walking at lunch time (as I had nothing else to do and wanted to stay in mouvement for my muscles). 

Day 5  :  This was the most difficult day. When I woke up the next morning, I was feeling dizzy, so I drank water with electrolytes, which helped a little, but the feeling came back from time to time during the day. The martial arts training was difficult, as I felt a lack of energy ; my mouvements were precise and I had no other choice than to train slowly by saving up my energy, but despite of this, I had to stop sometimes because of low blood pressure. I suppose that on that day, I didn't drink enough water.

Day 6 (present day) : I feel awesome since the start of the day and I have no doubt that I will be able to finish it like planned. The body seems now in a state where it has accepted that it won't get any food. Some of you are speaking of a feeling of clear mind, which I didn't notice (but my mind is very concentrated and focussed, like usual) ; maybe I have to fast longer in order to experience this. The only disturbing thing is my awful mouth smell, which is not ideal when you work with other people (or when your own family rejects you ). I feel that I could continue, but for a first experience, I prefer to stop here, especially because of my martial arts training, which I can't continue normally at this state. Now I must be careful with how I will reintroduce food tomorrow and hope that the body won't punish me.

Even if I knew about the theory, I am fascinated about this experience as well as the natural capabilities of the human body and I now plan to renew this every quarter.

But gold isn't worth a damn in this place, so this should come in handy.","[Hey](https://i.imgur.com/6oYH1sG.png#sprite) hey everyone. Before going any further, I wanted to take a moment to thank all of you for joining us for another Experimental Trial. DICE wouldn't be able to field new applicants for our training program without your continued support, and there isn't a day that goes by where we don't appreciate that. 

[We](https://i.imgur.com/55kz0ij.png#sprite) at DICE have noticed it can be really easy to lose track of the finer details when so much information is being thrown at the players all at once. That's why we decided to implement a new system for this year's batch of applicants called the ""Summary Thread."" Sorta like a synopsis that you'd find in an RPG reminding you what quests you've done so far.

[Each](https://i.imgur.com/r3ujDmN.png#sprite) part will be summarized below; that way the roleplayer can refresh themselves on the most important aspects of the conversation quickly and jump back into discussion with little interruption. If you notice any inaccuracies, or you disagree with any of the comments being made below, we encourage you to leave a helpful suggestion with your local human resources representative.

[Good](https://i.imgur.com/DDIwBxY.png#sprite) luck and don't forget to save regularly.

[Cut!](https://ik.imagekit.io/drrp/sprites/kokichi/02.png#sprite) Perfect! Why didn't you tell me you were such a natural in front of the camera!? You're a PR dynamo! 

[Next](https://ik.imagekit.io/drrp/sprites/kokichi/01.png#sprite) on the to do list! We‚Äôve been getting way too many complaints ~ so the big wigs figured we could reduce our intake 100% by firing the HR department! Genius, right!?

[So!](https://ik.imagekit.io/drrp/sprites/kokichi/02.png#sprite) I need you to give the same speech again! Except this time, instead of pretending someone will listen to our employees, remind everyone about how we got pizza for the office that one time! Oh! Oh! And how every other Tuesday is Tacky Tie Tuesday!

[Ready?](https://ik.imagekit.io/drrp/sprites/kokichi/10.png#sprite) Aaaaaaaaaaaaand ACTION!

#Truth Bullets

[Nanami File](#bullet) The victim is Byakuya Togami. Probably. Byakuya should have died at, maybe‚Ä¶10:35PM‚Ä¶ish? I think?

[Mikan's Autopsy](#bullet) The cause of death is suffocation from blood filling his lungs due to a stab to the neck. The death was within less than a minute. Yes, it was Byakuya Togami. 10:35PM matches what Mikan concluded from her analysis.

[DICE Directive #1 - The Friend Ship](#bullet) What ship never sinks? That‚Äôs right! The Friend Ship! Unfortunately, Hope‚Äôs Peak isn‚Äôt friendship, it‚Äôs a building, and it‚Äôs filling up with water with every passing moment. In an undetermined amount of time the entire school will be submerged. Unless‚Ä¶

[Adaptation is Key](#bullet) As the first floor was submerged, the astute staff working hard at DICE realized certain necessary faculties were no longer accessible. The fifth floor biology lab was converted into a room with a kitchen area and a dining area. Showers and additional sinks have been added to each communal bathroom on their respective floors. The Physics Lab on the fourth floor was turned into a theater room. Lastly, all classrooms are equipped with a basic lock that can only be locked from the inside.

[Byakuya's Adapted Library](#bullet) The library showed clear signs of Byakuya modifying to his personal preferences, with furniture shifted and personal items scattered. Some include the many books stacked on the table, a corner to write with a notebook and pens, another to sit and listen to vinyl records, and another for snacking and drinking. One particular modification is that there was originally a small glass vase on the front counter, but now only shattered pieces remain.  
 
[The Archives](#bullet) Byakuya repurposed the Archives, a room inside the Library, to become his sleeping quarters. The walls are lined up with shelves almost fully packed with volumes to long encyclopedias, each row being a different edition. Seemingly, the last book on one of the rows is missing. There is a sleeping bag on the floor and a small coffee table. The door to the Archives can be locked from the inside and showed no signs of tampering. 

[Uneven Coffee Table](#bullet) The coffee table inside the Archives had one of the four legs broken, needing about three inches to balance. Byakuya placed the twenty-first volume of The DICE-Revised Universal Compendium of All Knowledge‚Ñ¢Ô∏è under the leg to fix this problem.

[Slumber Party Massacre](#bullet) Rooms are less plentiful as the school fills with water ~ so people had to get creative with sleeping arrangements. The following people have confirmed their location of rest (courtesy sleeping bags and pillows provided by DICE): 

Byakuya - Archives

Ibuki + Himiko - Classroom 2A

Mondo + Chihiro - Classroom 2B

Komaru + Mikan - Classroom 3A

Yasuhiro + Gundham - Classroom 3B

Mukuro - Classroom 4A

Kaede + Maki + Kaito - Classroom 4B

Kirumi + Angie - Classroom 5A

Korekiyo - Classroom 5B

Fuyuhiko - Classroom 5C

[Idle Hands are the Devil‚Äôs Workshop](#bullet) At 8:00 AM this morning DICE sent a personalized message to every student. It indicated that their orientation period has finished and they are now to begin the training program in earnest. Each student was given a list of tasks unique to them that must be completed before midnight unless they were tired of that whole ‚Äúliving‚Äù thing.

[Isolation](#bullet) Upon finding out they were being ~~forced~~ invited into a DICE Killing Game, most of the class used this as a chance to unify. Byakuya was not one of those people. Shortly after the situation was apparent to all, Byakuya claimed the library for himself and would only occasionally leave for minimum periods of time for necessities such as going to the bathroom. 

[Body Discovery](#bullet) Shortly after 11 PM a loud noise sounding like glass shattering was heard coming from the library. Ibuki, Himiko, Chihiro, and Mondo followed the noise and found the library unlocked. They found Byakuya‚Äôs corpse after walking into the library and noticing the scent of blood from the Archives room. Upon seeing the corpse the body discovery announcement rang out (11:20 PM) and the remaining class members arrived shortly after. 

[Crime Scene](#bullet) Byakuya was found in the library archive lying face down head towards the door. Blood can be found on his neck where the stab wound was made and a trail can be observed from his sleeping bag to the door. Blood is on his hands and the door knob. 

[Knives Out](#bullet) A knife was found at the scene of the crime next to Byakuya‚Äôs body. The knife has stains of blood on the blade.

[Missing Glue](#bullet) Angie noticed that Fast Acting Glue went missing from the art room at 3:30pm. 

[All the World‚Äôs a Stage](#bullet) Chiaki and Kokichi confirm that Byakuya's task was to do public dramatic readings. From 3:30-5:00 PM  Byakuya performed different renditions of Shakespeare to the absolute delight of Kokichi. Chiaki and Komaru were there as well.

[Maintenance Issues](#bullet) Korekiyo investigated the Chemistry Lab and something seems to be clogging the drain of the sink.

[Stuck Books](#bullet) Gundham attempted to move some of the books on a shelf of the Archives and was unable to dislodge any book in the row whatsoever.

[Glass Pieces](#bullet) Fuyuhiko tried to gather the scattered glass shards. He used a book to transport the pieces but quickly abandoned the idea when the jagged edges began slicing into the book‚Äôs cover with minimal pressure.

[Kirumi's Testimony](#bullet) Kirumi claims that her task entailed cooking a lot of food, so she kept the Kitchen (Biology Lab) occupied from 7:45AM to 10PM. She can testify that Kaito, Maki, Ibuki, Yasuhiro, Komaru, Gundham, Angie, and Himiko, and only these people, entered the kitchen at various times outside of usual meal hours, when the kitchen was not off-limits.

[Knife Holder](#bullet) The kitchen knives are stored in a stand affixed to the countertop, but one of the knives is missing. The object is coated with water on the outside.
 
[Ibuki's Testimony](#bullet) During investigation, Ibuki was investigating the kitchen, and while handling the knife holder, accidentally let her ring fall inside one of the slits. She tried several methods to get it out, but she couldn't find a way into the opening. 

[Mukuro and Maki‚Äôs Testimony](#bullet) During their investigation, Mukuro and Maki discussed the possibility of hiding in the Archives. They confirmed that the entrance offered a clear view of all corners. Although they identified a way for a makeshift stack of books to possibly conceal someone, it would stand out enough to arouse suspicion.

[Kitchen Fire](#bullet) Kaito was attempting to cook a very masculine strawberry cake with pink frosting before one thing led to another and (in what could have happened to anyone) started a kitchen fire at around 10:30 PM causing the sprinklers to douse the room in water. Maki discovered the commotion and was appropriately disappointed in him. They left the room about fifteen minutes after, with permission from Chiaki, as the room would fix itself overnight.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Since childhood, I have grown accustomed to the familiar images of returning home for Tet by train, airplane, or bus. However, my first experience traveling more than one thousand kilometers in a four-seater car‚Äîa new gift from my father‚Äîopened an entirely new chapter in my ‚Äúfirst life experiences.‚Äù This journey was not merely about traveling from the city to my hometown; it was also a voyage of self-discovery, an examination of my health, and a test of my ability to cope with life‚Äôs unexpected challenges.

**I. A Challenging Journey on Vietnam‚Äôs Roads**

Sitting in a car for the first time, I vividly experienced the hardships of a long journey as I had to remain seated from morning until night in a cramped, confined space. Although the new car only accommodated five passengers, it was the means by which my entire family‚Äîeven my cousin‚Äîtraversed over a thousand kilometers along highways and national roads. Throughout the trip, the cramped conditions became increasingly evident: I could not stretch my legs, which led to overwhelming fatigue, numb thighs, back pain, and even worries about developing a herniated disc.

Additionally, the car‚Äôs interior was permeated by a mixture of odors‚Äîthe scent of gasoline, the air conditioner, and other unusual smells‚Äîthat amplified my discomfort. I never imagined that such unpleasant odors could gradually wear me down, even causing nausea. Despite my attempts to open the windows slightly to allow fresh air in, the confined space forced me to surrender to sleep as a way to escape both the offensive smells and the onset of motion sickness.

**II. Real Moments and Coping Strategies**

In addition to battling fatigue from prolonged sitting, I also had to manage various issues that arose along the way. The need to frequently stop for breakfast, lunch, and dinner‚Äîwith meals prepared at home, such as fruit‚Äîwas economical but did little to alleviate the discomfort of eating on the go in less-than-ideal conditions. At times, a roadside coffee shop became a rare haven where I could pause, take a breather, and address personal needs in a dignified manner.

Interestingly, after several trips, I gradually discovered a ‚Äútrick‚Äù to counteract the unpleasant odors in the car‚Äîespecially the smells of gasoline and the air conditioner, which were the primary triggers for my motion sickness. Previously, I had experimented with opening a can of fruit-flavored soda or using orange and tangerine peels to mask the offensive odor, but these measures were not very effective. After experiencing near-nausea each time I encountered the car‚Äôs smell, I learned a valuable lesson: one must prepare a type of fruit juice with a strong, distinctive fragrance to replace and neutralize the car‚Äôs odor. This soda‚Äîinfused with flavors like passion fruit, coconut, peach, and mango‚Äînot only provided a refreshing sensation but also helped me avoid motion sickness. Simply opening the can allowed its aroma to spread, effectively masking any unwanted odors.

**III. Lessons on Health and Maturing Spirit**

My journey across Vietnam was not just about overcoming geographical distances‚Äîit was also a voyage of personal health exploration. Whether traveling from the city to the countryside or vice versa, I came to understand the limits of my own body. Sitting continuously, being unable to stretch, and constantly being exposed to the car‚Äôs odors taught me to recognize my physical boundaries: whether I possessed the endurance to handle long trips and whether my body was prone to environmental allergies.

Through these challenges, I learned how to better prepare for future journeys. I realized that equipping myself with small ‚Äútools‚Äù‚Äîsuch as pleasantly scented fruit juice, using a face mask to counteract foul smells, or even choosing between a newly built highway and a slower national road‚Äîcan greatly enhance the comfort of the journey. I also witnessed firsthand the transformation of Vietnam‚Äôs transportation infrastructure, evolving from old national roads to modern highways, such as the Cam Ranh‚ÄìNha Trang‚ÄìD·∫ßu Gi√¢y expressway spanning approximately 300 kilometers, which, despite its challenges, significantly reduced travel time.

**IV. Connecting Personal Experiences with the International Academic Journey**

Reflecting on that long journey, I realized that every challenge, every bout of fatigue, and every creative solution was an invaluable lesson in personal growth. Overcoming the discomfort of sitting all day, managing the car‚Äôs persistent odor, and enduring motion sickness taught me the virtues of patience, problem-solving, and the importance of listening to one‚Äôs body. These experiences have built a solid foundation for me to face new challenges‚Äîincluding those that come with studying abroad.

Traveling across Vietnam was not merely a homecoming trip; it was a journey of self-discovery, a test of my physical limits, and an exercise in adaptability. It taught me that no matter where I am, thorough preparation and a relentless pursuit of learning are the keys to overcoming any obstacle. Consequently, I am confident that if granted a scholarship for international study, I will eagerly embrace new challenges, continue to learn, and further develop myself in a global academic environment.

**V. Conclusion**

My first journey by car was not simply a memory of long, exhausting hours on the road‚Äîit was a transformative experience filled with precious life lessons. It enabled me to better understand my own health, to push past my limits, and to devise creative solutions to adapt to challenging circumstances. These experiences have instilled in me a firm belief in my resilience and a passion for continuous learning, qualities that I believe will serve as invaluable assets as I embark on my academic journey abroad.

1ijyttv,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ijyttv/espresso_beans_what_works_what_doesnt_and_why_you/,"Espresso Beans: What Works, What Doesn‚Äôt, and Why You Should Care ‚òï","I‚Äôve been geeking out over this for a while now, and I think it‚Äôs time to share some thoughts, experiences, and maybe save a few of you from some¬†*facepalm*¬†moments. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è That said, I‚Äôm no ultimate authority‚Äîjust a fellow coffee lover sharing what I‚Äôve learned. If I get anything wrong or miss something, please point it out in the comments! üôè

First off, let‚Äôs get one thing straight:¬†**NOT ALL COFFEE BEANS ARE CREATED EQUAL FOR ESPRESSO**. I know, I know, it sounds obvious, but you‚Äôd be surprised how many people just grab any bag of beans off the shelf and wonder why their shot tastes like burnt rubber. üò¨

# What Makes a Bean ""Espresso-Worthy""?

1. **Roast Level**:
   * **Medium to Dark Roasts**¬†are your best friends here. Light roasts can be tricky because they‚Äôre more acidic and less forgiving when it comes to extraction. Dark roasts? They‚Äôre bold, rich, and usually easier to dial in, but don‚Äôt go¬†*too*¬†dark unless you want your espresso to taste like charcoal.
   * Personally, I‚Äôm a¬†**medium-dark**¬†guy. It gives me that sweet spot of complexity without losing the espresso‚Äôs signature body. But hey, taste is subjective‚Äîwhat works for me might not work for you!
2. **Bean Origin**:
   * Single-origin vs. blends? Both can work, but they bring different vibes to the table.
   * **Single-origin beans**¬†are great if you want to taste the unique flavors of a specific region (think fruity Ethiopian or chocolatey Colombian).
   * **Blends**, on the other hand, are often designed specifically for espresso. They balance acidity, sweetness, and body to create a consistent shot. My go-to blend right now is a Brazil/Colombia mix‚Äîsmooth, nutty, and a little caramel-y. ü§§ But again, this is just my preference‚Äîyour mileage may vary!
3. **Freshness**:
   * This is non-negotiable. If your beans aren‚Äôt fresh, your espresso will taste flat, stale, or just plain sad. üò¢
   * Look for a¬†**roast date**¬†on the bag (not just a ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date). Ideally, you want beans that were roasted within the last 2-3 weeks. And please, for the love of all things caffeinated,¬†**grind your beans right before brewing**. Pre-ground? Just‚Ä¶ no. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# My Top Picks (and Why)

1. **Lavazza Super Crema**:
   * A classic Italian blend that‚Äôs super forgiving for beginners. It‚Äôs creamy, balanced, and works well with most machines. Plus, it‚Äôs easy to find and won‚Äôt break the bank.
2. **Stumptown Hair Bender**:
   * If you‚Äôre into more complex flavors, this blend is a game-changer. It‚Äôs got notes of citrus, dark chocolate, and a hint of sweetness. Perfect for those who like to nerd out over flavor profiles.
3. **Onyx Monarch**:
   * A bit pricier, but oh-so-worth-it. This blend is rich, velvety, and has this amazing dark fruit vibe. It‚Äôs like a luxury espresso experience in a cup.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

1. **Using Beans Meant for Filter Coffee:**
   * Just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúspecialty coffee‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good for espresso. Filter beans are often roasted lighter and can lead to under-extraction or sour shots.
2. **Ignoring the Grind:**
   * Even the best beans won‚Äôt save you if your grind is off. Invest in a good grinder (I‚Äôm looking at you, Niche Zero fans) and take the time to dial in your shot.
3. **Storing Beans Wrong:**
   * Keep your beans in an airtight container, away from light, heat, and moisture. And please, don‚Äôt freeze them unless you want to ruin the flavor.
