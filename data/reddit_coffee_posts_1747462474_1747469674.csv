So I'm a pretty sensible guy *99% of the time*. But sometimes, I get that little voice in my head that says, ""Go and do something wild!"". Here I am, caving into that voice, seeing what the world of Reddit might have in store for me.

What am I looking for? I'm pretty open-minded, so long as it's fun :). If you want to chat, meet up, or much wilder things besides, then that's all on the proverbial menu. Do you have a bucket list of things you want to do? Maybe we could tick a few things off...

A few bits about me. I work a senior finance job in London (boring!) but I make sure I enjoy myself outside of work. I'm a bit of a music nerd and love discovering new bands (or just rinsing my old favourites). If you have any bangers you want to share, then feel free to send them over! When I get the chance I also like live music and sometimes play in a band (when people stop leaving it lol). I'm hoping to get more gigs in the diary this year.

Aside from that, I enjoy typical millenial blokey stuff like video games, running (when my knees co-operate), reading, gentle strolls in the park trying to avoid squaring up to squirrels, and buying overpriced coffee.

In terms of physical traits, I'm 5'9"" (not getting any taller, sorry), White, Slim, Shaved head and bearded, the typical Redditor look lol. I'm well-groomed, hygienic, and like to take care of myself, so hopefully you're similar :)

If any of that floats your boat, then sail into my DMs.",1,1747469195.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

It was a lovely day here and me and the misses decided to go into town and grab a burger. Started off with a decaf coffee (I'm allergic to caffeine) and landed on a ginger ale to go with my burger. It was lovely. No booze. No pressure. After that we went to do some fun shopping, so we hit the record store and bought some really great albums. I'm not gonna bother you with my obscure musical taste, but let's just say Nick Drake is criminally underrated. Also, our vacuum broke the day before so we got a new one. Holy hell, are those things expensive! 

Anyway - after that it was like 4 in the afternoon and that's usually the time I start drinking. Or in this case, would continue to drink, because we all know I would have had at least three beers with that burger. But.. while I did feel the urge to drink, I didn't. I mentioned it to my wife and she was supportive as ever. So I didn't bump into the local liquor store or pub and went home. My stepdaughter came over that night and I made diner. It was a lovely evening and we had a nice long walk after diner.

So I would like some advice especially from women. My dating game is really bad. Like I have been in relationships but all of them went from being friends to then getting closer. I am not really good at flirting etc.

There's this girl at my work. I have been noticing her for sometime. More than a couple days back I introduced myself and then after that for 2 days have been going on small walks with her for breaks.  
On both the days the conversation was friendly. It wasn't flirty. I am not sure if I should have taken it in that direction. Anyways I am not that smooth with flirting. I did compliment her nails which are super cute ngl and also her dressing sense. It's cute.

I don't really know how to proceed from here. We did follow each other on instagram. Sometimes there have been glances being passed, smiles etc etc.

I am nervous. It's after a 2 year span I have a crush on someone. Idk what to do.

What I am thinking? - I was thinking of pinging her on instagram. Seeing if she replies and maybe do some small talk. If that works maybe ask her out for a coffee or something.

I don't know what to do. A part of me says be you. If it's meant to be it'll. Although one advice I want to know. People usually say don't compliment girls on their appearance in the beginning. Just wanted to know how true this is. It's just that I have never seen someone as cute as her to the extent that when she walked into the hall that day my mind could only process one thing ""You're fucked!"".

1konphb,https://www.reddit.com/r/prediabetes/comments/1konphb/looking_for_advice/,Looking for advice,"I got an hba1c test back in March, with a reading of 41mmol/mol which I was told was normal and okay but other sources say it's prediabetic so I was a bit worried, but with busy life I hadn't been able to start making any changes. 

I'm starting them now, including losing some weight and trying to eat a little better, and I bought a blood glucose machine to keep track (Beurer GL44). I'm worrying that I'm either doing something really wrong, or I've progressed somehow this quickly into full blown diabetes. 

  
I've been testing multiple times at once to try and be accurate, but the readings make no sense to me. Yesterday, I was using a vanilla scented soap which I learned can mess up the readings so today I used a normal unscented soap.

08.05 - First reading without eating was 6,8mmol/L

08.09 - Second reading minutes later without eating was now 7,0mmol/L

I reused the same lancet twice, but two different strips. I also squeezed my finger a bit both times because I can't seem to get enough blood otherwise.

  
I ate breakfast at around 09.00, which was a tofu scramble with peppers, a little oil, a tbsp of oat milk, and some salt. I also had a coffee with around 100ml of a lighter (lower sugar) oat milk and Torani Sugar Free syrup. I also vaped some nicotine and took my medication (Concerta).

  
10.14 - 6,0mmol/L (new lancet, squeezed finger)

10.15 - 9,7mmol/L (same lancet as 10.14, squeezed finger)

10.24 - 11,7mmol/L (new lancet, squeezed finger)

  
This kind of jump doesn't make any sense, right? Is it because of squeezing my finger? Is it more likely to be that the first reading is more accurate (6,0mmol/L)? What can I do to make sure that I'm getting the most accurate results? I noticed if I don't squeeze a bit the blood can take a while or not come out enough, I wasted a couple test strips before because the strip couldn't get enough blood. 

  
I guess I'm also just quite anxious about these higher readings, worrying that I've progressed from an hba1c of 41mmol/mol (5,9% - average of 6,79mmol/L) to diabetes in just two months. I know stress can affect sugars too, which I'm trying to be mindful of, but diabetes is a very scary thing for me to think about and a number one cause of a lot of my health anxiety. 

  
In terms of changes, I'm starting to eat better and losing some weight (I'm very slightly into the obese category), as well as eating more in the right order. I'm just worried with these readings that I'm too late. I don't really have any of the major diabetes symptoms like excessive thirst, fatigue, frequent urination, etc. ",1,1747468627.0,prediabetes,0,1.0,False
1kono5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1kono5v/water_on_sickness_on_energy/,Water: On sickness & On energy,"I just wanted to make this post because these two thoughts keep popping to mind. 

1. Sickness

A few years ago I read a book on fasting from 1910. It‚Äôs called Rational Fasting by Arnold Ehret and while what we know about the human body is far more today and science has grown in leaps and bounds, it‚Äôs interesting to read the perspective of this 100+ year old book. And of all the things in that book one of the things that is a recurring thought is - he says you don‚Äôt see animals sick in the wild. When animals get too sick to hunt for food, they rest and fast near water. And by drinking water and not eating, they heal themselves. 

You could probably find a way to argue any or all of that but for whatever reason the idea that we are biologically designed to be able to self repair sickness by just shutting down, drinking water, and giving the body time to repair itself is kind of an amazing thought. 

2. Energy

I‚Äôve done three day dirty fasts before when the only thing other than water was zero sugar energy drinks. (Guys, they are the worst thing for you, never drink them. I know that. You know that. But we all have vices.)  But recently I did a 100 hr fast without energy drinks or coffee. Without any sort of caffeine

And I had more energy. But calm energy. Not over stimulated energy. I didn‚Äôt have fidgety nervous energy.

And that got me thinking about why - and there‚Äôs a lot of information on this. According to that information - Coffee doesn‚Äôt give you energy. Caffeine does not give you energy. It just makes you stimulated. I was tired - but stimulated.

Our energy levels aren‚Äôt low - we just haven‚Äôt flipped ON the ‚Äúuse x as our energy fuel source‚Äù toggle - which we absolutely can do. You‚Äôre a warehouse of energy waiting to be burned. Most of your body can be used as an energy source in the right conditions.. Fat is broken down into energy if you‚Äôre adapted to that. Things like skin cells, and damaged tissue, and bacteria can all be burned for energy. Even muscle can be broken down into energy.

So if you are looking to burn fat for energy - then simulating energy through caffeine will not feel the same. And when you do start being fat-adapted to burning fat - it‚Äôs way more energizing and a cleaner calmer energy than how the caffeine stimulant felt. 

And in that regard, just water was the better energy drink. 

But if the caffeine helps, and you need it, by all means, you do what‚Äôs right for you. I do. 

Anyway, this is all probably debatable and I don‚Äôt claim to be an expert, so don‚Äôt take any of that as fact. It‚Äôs just some thoughts that have stuck with me and I wanted to share. 

As always, do your own research and do what‚Äôs right for yourself. Cheers.

**Chapter 1 I'm Not My Boyfriend's Bride-to-be**



""I'll marry you, Mr. Foster.""  
  
Yvonne Scott made this call after downing half a bottle of wine.  
  
There was silence on the other end of the line before a deep, annoyed voice, rough from sleep, finally replied.  
  
""Do you realize what time it is?""  
  
Yvonne hadn't paid attention and quickly checked her phone‚Äîit was already 2:00 a.m.  
  
""Sorry about that. I'll call back tomorrow.""  
  
""Alright. My wife-to-be""  
  
""Huh?""  
  
""By the way, I'm heading overseas for a business trip tomorrow. I'll be away for about a month. Once I'm back, we can register for marriage.""  
  
""Okay.""  
  
After ending the call, Yvonne felt a little lightheaded.  
  
A couple of weeks earlier, her aunt from the countryside gave her a call, eager to introduce her to a potential boyfriend, Hendrix Foster.   
  
He was the grandson of their neighbor, Laurel Reed.  
  
He had been an outstanding student since childhood. After graduating from a university in Northville, he landed a high-paying job with an excellent work-life balance and ample growth opportunities.  
  
Although Yvonne had agreed verbally at that time, she didn't take it seriously and only intended to go along with the suggestion out of politeness. However, that very evening, Hendrix contacted her. He bluntly stated that he wasn't interested in blind dates or dating and proposed skipping straight to marriage if she was willing.  
  
""Is he crazy?""  
  
That was her only thought at that time.  
  
Before she could respond, he told her to think it over and abruptly ended the call.  
  
In truth, Yvonne hadn't given it any thought over the past two weeks. But tonight, she decided to say yes.  
  
Meanwhile, the internet was abuzz with trending news.  
  
The famous actress, Eliana Watson, was rumored to be pregnant, with speculation that the father was a married Best Actor.  
  
Shortly after Eliana was labeled a 'mistress' and became a trending topic, the second heir of the Jackmans, Zaid,  stepped forward to clarify. He announced that Eliana was his only and one girlfriend, and the baby she was carrying was his. They were planning to get married soon.  
  
Facing skepticism from many netizens, he released a video as proof. The footage at Eliana's recent birthday party showed him kneeling to propose.  
  
This revelation flipped public opinion. Fans and netizens alike began to offer their blessings.  
  
The top trending topic was ""Zaid Jackman and Eliana Watson are gonna get married"".  
  
Yvonne glanced at it and felt a pang of irony.  
  
*If Eliana is his only and one girlfriend, then what about me?*  
  
*What about the eight years I have spent by his side?*  
  
Realizing her foolishness, Yvonne decided it was time to stop it.  
  
Her decision to marry Hendrix had stemmed from his simple but heartfelt words.  
  
""I want to live an ordinary life with my wife‚Äîsupporting each other, respecting one another, and growing old together.""  
  
It was her desired life, but Zaid had never been willing to give it to her.  
  
With her thoughts sorted, Yvonne began packing her belongings.  
  
The villa belonged to Zaid, so she needed to move out quickly.  
  
Since Yvonne had to work an early shift, she only managed to get a couple of hours of sleep before waking up.  
  
When she went downstairs, she noticed Zaid sprawled on the couch, his hair a mess and his face tense. It was clear he'd had too much to drink last night and was still feeling the effects.  
  
Choosing to ignore him, she headed into the kitchen to prepare breakfast.  
  
While she was cooking pasta, Zaid stumbled in, reeking of alcohol. He hugged her from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder.  
  
""Ugh, my head is killing me. Make me a cup of coffee,"" he mumbled.  
  
Yvonne went into the kitchen, pulled a can from the top shelf of the cabinet, and inside was his favorite coffee beans. He only drank freshly ground coffee, so whenever he wanted some, she would grind the beans and brew it slowly.  
  
Once it was done, she added milk, and while she was pouring the latte art, she couldn't help but laugh at herself. She'd been making coffee for eight years‚Äîenough to warm his stomach, but not his heart. As she finished a heart shape, she couldn't resist drawing a long line through the center of it.  
  
When Zaid came out of the shower, Yvonne placed the coffee in front of him. He quietly picked it up, seemingly not planning to explain what had happened last night. When he noticed the long line in the heart, that was when Yvonne broke the silence.  
  
""Congratulations.""  
  
Zaid glanced up, his handsome face showing a hint of confusion. ""What for?""  
  
She answered calmly, ""For proposing to Eliana on her birthday again and finally getting a yes after all these years.""  
  
She had always known about Zaid's feelings for Eliana. His love had spanned 15 years, beginning when they were in junior high.  
  
Every year on Eliana's birthday, he proposed to her. Even during the eight years he had been with Yvonne, that pattern hadn't changed.  
  
Yvonne had cared deeply, of course. But her love for Zaid had been so self-sacrificial that she endured it.  
  
Zaid's expression darkened. ""You've seen the news, haven't you?""  
  
Yvonne didn't respond, simply meeting his gaze.  
  
After a moment, he nodded and said nonchalantly, ""Eliana and I are only entering into a fake marriage. Once the media frenzy dies down, we'll get divorced.""  
  
""A fake marriage?"" Yvonne was momentarily speechless and smiled. ""Will there be a marriage certificate? A wedding?""  
  
""Obviously. Without them, neither of our families would agree to it.""  
  
""Then how is it a fake marriage?"" she questioned.  
  
""It'll be fake. There's no need for you to understand everything."" After sipping the coffee, Zaid stood and headed toward the stairs.  
  
Yvonne stopped him. ""I have no interest in interfering with your choices, but we need to settle things between us.""  
  
Zaid turned back, his tone impatient. ""What are you trying to say?""  
  
Taking a steadying breath, she replied, ""Let's break up.""  
  
""You still don't get it, do you? My marriage to Eliana is just for show. We'll get divorced soon enough. What's the big deal? It's none of your concern. You could just turn a blind eye! Are you trying to make yourself relevant?""  
  
*Make myself relevant? So funny.*  
  
Lowering her gaze, Yvonne spoke firmly, ""It doesn't matter if your marriage to Eliana is real or fake. I'm done with you. I want to end this.""  
  
""Yvonne!""  
  
""I'm exhausted,"" she said, closing her eyes. ""I've loved you for eight years, giving everything I had. I can't do this anymore. It's over.""  
  
""Fine, you want to break up? Don't come crying back later!""  
  
Zaid didn't bother going upstairs. He grabbed his coat and stormed out in anger.  
  
For Yvonne, that was the end of it. She felt surprisingly lighter, as though a weight had been lifted.  
  
She worked as a doctor in the obstetrics and gynecology department at Cloudstream Hospital. Arriving at the office early in the morning, she began receiving patients while overhearing gossip from the nurse, Molly Zinn.  
  
""Do you know whose baby Eliana is carrying? They said it was a married actor's before. Seems like it could be Andrew's, but Zaid claimed it was his last night. Such drama. Honestly, if it were me, I'd pick Zaid. He's not just wealthy, but also incredibly handsome. I heard Zaid is very faithful. He's been in love with her for 15 years! Who wouldn't be impressed by his dedication?""  
  
Yvonne wasn't interested in the gossip and promptly asked Molly to take a pregnant patient upstairs for an examination.  
  
However, her brief moment of quiet didn't last long. Zaid called her again.  
  
""Eliana will be coming to your hospital for a prenatal check-up tomorrow. Be ready to take care of her.""  



**Chapter 2 He's Faithful, but I'm His Backup**



Yvonne's patience snapped. ""There are plenty of hospitals in Cloudville. Why did you have to come here? And why involve me?""  
  
Despite her protest, Eliana still arrived early the next morning.  
  
As soon as she stepped out of the car, she was swarmed by obsessive fans and paparazzi. With security arranged in advance and Zaid's protection, she managed to make it into the hospital.  
  
Yvonne had already handed the case to another obstetrician, but Eliana insisted they were friends. That led Glen Baxter, the hospital director, to instruct Yvonne to take over.  
  
The prenatal tests were completed quickly, and Yvonne reviewed the report. Everything appeared normal.  
  
""The pregnancy is estimated to be ten weeks and three days. Since this is your first check-up, you'll need to prepare a pregnancy test manual,"" Yvonne said, glancing away from the computer to look at Zaid. ""The instructions are posted on the wall behind you. Just follow them.""  
  
Zaid frowned, finding it bothersome. ""You handle it. I'll stay with Eliana.""  
  
Yvonne's tone turned firm. ""I'm sorry, but this manual must be processed by the patient or their family. As a doctor, it's not my responsibility.""  
  
""Yvonne, can't you see Eliana needs me right now? Couldn't you show some understanding?""  
  
""If every family member expected me to be understanding, I'd end up running errands all day,"" she replied flatly.  
  
Zaid frowned. ""You‚Äî""  
  
""Next!""  
  
He was about to argue, but Eliana intervened.  
  
""Yvonne, please don't be upset. I won't burden him.""  
  
Yvonne looked at Eliana. For 15 years, Eliana had maintained a close relationship with Zaid, just enough to feel his need, but never to the point of overstepping boundaries. Even though Zaid had once been Yvonne's boyfriend, Eliana had accepted his devotion while presenting herself as Yvonne's friend.  
  
""He's your fianc√©,"" Yvonne said calmly. ""Isn't it normal to ask him for help? Why would I be upset?""  
  
""Is it because of me that you two argued?"" Eliana asked.  
  
""There was no argument. We've already broken up.""  
  
""Yvonne, you're misunderstanding Zaid. He was only trying to help me.""  
  
Raising her hand, Yvonne cut her off. ""You don't matter to me. You're not the reason we broke up. Don't think highly of yourself.""  
  
""Yvonne, how dare you treat Eliana like that? Apologize to her!"" Zaid yelled.  
  
Yvonne had tried to hold back, but she couldn't anymore.  
  
""Get lost!"" she snapped.  
  
Her harsh response led to a report being filed against her. Zaid made the complaint call right in front of her.  
  
After they left, Yvonne was summoned to Glen's office.  
  
""Do you know that our hospital is under Jackman Healthcare?"" Glen asked.  
  
Yvonne stayed silent, fully aware of it.  
  
""The two people you just received are Eliana, a famous actress, and Zaid, the second son of the Jackmans,"" Glen said, looking at her, hoping she'd realize the seriousness of her actions.  
  
""So what?"" Yvonne replied nonchalantly, hands in her pockets.  
  
Glen slammed the table in frustration. ""Yvonne, do you even want to keep your job here?""  
  
""If the issue is simply that I refused a difficult request from Mr. Zaid, making him unhappy and risking my job, then I think I need to file for labor arbitration,"" she answered.  
  
""You don't get it, do you? That's the second son of the Jackmans! You're just a doctor. Do you think you can afford to offend him?""  
  
""I still have patients to take care of. Unless you have more instructions, I'll get back to work,"" Yvonne responded, ready to leave.  
  
""Why are you so stubborn?"" Glen asked, blocking her exit. ""There's one more thing. Ms. Watson trusts you a lot, but she can't come to the hospital. From now on, you'll be her attending physician and provide home visits whenever necessary.""  
  
""I refuse!""  
  
""You don't have a choice!""  
  
Back in her office, Yvonne felt overwhelmed. She couldn't understand why Zaid treated her so badly.  
  
After loving him fully for eight years, was her devotion now the reason he was bullying her?  
  
""The manual is ready.""  
  
She hadn't expected Zaid and Eliana to show up, and their faces held no sign of guilt.  
  
Yvonne smiled bitterly and silently took the manual, entering the information into the computer.  
  
""The manual outlines what pregnant women need to be aware of. Please read it carefully. I'll mark the next check-up date in the manual‚Äîdon't forget to come,"" she said, writing down the date.  
  
""We're both busy. I need you to remind me about the appointment. I'll bring her then,"" Zaid said.  
  
Yvonne paused for a moment, then replied, ""I'm probably busier than both of you. I don't have time to worry about your affairs.""  
  
""Eliana's affairs are my affairs, and mine are yours. Just remind me when the time comes. No need for nonsense.""  
  
Yvonne glanced at Zaid, filled with conflicting emotions, but they quickly faded. ""We've already broken up. I don't want to say more. You can keep complaining about me, but I treat all my patients the same, following the hospital's system.""  
  
Zaid pursed his lips, sensing a firm resolve in Yvonne.  
  
""I'll remember that,"" Eliana said and pulled Zaid's hand, offering a generous look. ""Thanks, Yvonne. I may trouble you later.""  
  
""It's no trouble. It's just part of the job.""  
  
""Then we won't keep you any longer.""  
  
""Goodbye.""  
  
As they were about to leave, a group of obsessive fans rushed in, their phones aimed at Eliana and Zaid.  
  
""Ms. Watson, are you and Mr. Andrew Lloyd just friends? How do you explain both of you coming and going from the hotel late at night?""  
  
""Mr. Jackman, did you truly propose to Ms. Watson? Or is this just for show?""  
  
""Are you truly a couple? Ms. Watson, didn't you clarify before that you and Mr. Jackman are only good friends?""  
  
The crowd pushed forward, shoving each other.  
  
Zaid immediately shielded Eliana, though he was still jostled.  
  
The security guards couldn't get through, so Yvonne quickly came around from behind the desk to help Zaid keep the crowd away.  
  
Seeing her approach, Zaid handed Eliana to Yvonne.  
  
""Take care of Eliana!""  
  
With that, he turned to the fans and paparazzi, yelling, ""Leave now!""  
  
But the crowd didn't listen, and they kept pushing closer to dig up the news.  
  
One person managed to get closer to Eliana, but others behind pushed them forward, causing a domino effect that ended with Eliana getting bumped.  
  
Yvonne swiftly stepped in front of her, but two people shoved her, sending her crashing into the edge of a table.  
  
""Ouch!""  
  
Already in pain, Yvonne barely recovered before Zaid, pulling Eliana with him, accidentally bumped her again, causing her to hit the table corner once more. She cried out in pain.  
  
At that moment, Zaid pulled Eliana into a hug and then kissed her.  



**Chapter 3 It Turns Out I'm Not Worthy**



In front of a crowd, with cameras flashing and live broadcasts streaming, thousands of people were watching.  
  
Zaid kissed Eliana softly. His affection was evident in the gentle kiss.  
  
Yvonne stood there like a backdrop, appearing redundant and laughable at that moment.  
  
""See that? Do you still have doubts?""  
  
Zaid was furious, pointing at the obsessive fans and paparazzi crammed into the office.  
  
""Want to know our love story? Fine, I'll tell you today!  
  
""I've been in love with Eliana since junior high. I confessed to her after graduating high school, and we've been together for eight years. During that time, I've loved no one but her, and I'll love her forever!  
  
""I'll give her a grand wedding. Only Eliana is worthy of my love‚Äîno one else can compare!""  
  
He passionately declared his feelings, and his words were witnessed by countless people online and offline.  
  
The sound of applause interrupted the moment, causing everyone to look toward the source.  
  
Yvonne, dressed in a white coat and with neatly cut short hair, radiated a simple yet graceful elegance.  
  
She smiled and clapped, encouraging the fans, paparazzi, and onlookers to join in.  
  
Zaid glanced at her, his eyes flashing with a brief sense of guilt.  
  
""Mr. Jackman's dedication is truly touching. I wish you both happiness,"" Yvonne said calmly.  
  
Zaid's expression instantly darkened.  
  
""Keep your blessings to yourself. We don't need them!""  
  
He then took Eliana's arm and stormed out.  
  
As they left, the obsessive fans and onlookers dispersed, and the office fell silent.  
  
Yvonne sat down, holding her side where she had just bumped into something, the pain from the bruise throbbing. She lifted her clothes to reveal two bruises there.  
  
Later that afternoon, just before leaving work, Yvonne's phone buzzed. She saw a new message from someone adding her on WhatsApp.  
  
""I'm Hendrix Foster.""  
  
*Hendrix?*  
  
Yvonne paused for a moment, trying to remember who Hendrix was.  
  
She realized she had only spoken to him twice, both times over the phone. Since they were engaged, she should have added him on WhatsApp, so she accepted his friend request.  
  
Once the request was accepted, she was left staring at a blank screen, unsure of what to say. After a moment of thinking, she decided to close the app and finish packing up for the day.  
  
Yvonne had worked the day shift and finished her rounds in the inpatient department. By the time she left the hospital, it was already dark. She was about to hail a taxi when a black Maybach pulled up in front of her.  
  
The window rolled down, and Xavier Lambert waved with a smile. ""Yvonne, Sean's bar is opening today. He specifically asked me to pick you up after work to celebrate.""  
  
Xavier stressed the word 'specifically' and chuckled.  
  
Xavier and Sean Howard were Zaid's childhood friends, and Yvonne was also friendly with them, so she agreed to join them for the celebration.  
  
Inside the car, Xavier handed her a bottle of water.  
  
""I was there for Eliana's birthday too,"" Xavier said, sounding a little guilty.  
  
Yvonne twisted off the cap and took a few sips of water. She had seen the video of Eliana's birthday celebration. When Zaid knelt to propose, Xavier loudly cheered, ""Marry him! Marry him!""  
  
""I thought I was just a regular part of Eliana's birthday celebration. I didn't take it seriously, and I don't think Zaid did either. Who would've thought Eliana would say yes? I'm sure she had her reasons, but it's a little unfair to you.""  
  
""Thanks for acknowledging the unfair part.""  
  
""Uh, Zaid only did it to help Eliana.""  
  
""If it's just as friends, and you had to choose between me and Eliana, who would you pick?""  
  
Without hesitation, Xavier responded, ""Of course, it's you!""  
  
Yvonne smiled. ""Even if you're lying, it still makes me feel better.""  
  
He shook his head. ""I'm not lying. Even though I've known Eliana longer, I prefer being friends with you.""  
  
""That's why you came to pick me up today, and I got in your car. But let's not bring up Zaid again. We're done.""  
  
Xavier stuck out his tongue. ""People say things in the heat of the moment. What you said doesn't count.""  
  
Yvonne frowned. Did he think she was just upset and didn't truly want to break up with Zaid?  
  
Sean's new bar was tucked away at the back of an alley in a courtyard. The walls had theatrical decorations, and there was a small pond in the middle. Lamps hung along the corridor, giving the place a quiet, atmospheric vibe.  
  
Xavier pointed to the room at the far end and then left for the restroom.  
  
As Yvonne approached the door and was about to open it, she heard Zaid's voice, full of anger.  
  
""Sean, you're so annoying! She's the one who caused the breakup, not me!""  
  
Sean sighed. ""But it's your fault after all.""  
  
""Eliana needs my help.""  
  
""But what about Yvonne‚Äî""  
  
""Yvonne doesn't matter compared to Eliana!""  
  
""You'll regret it!""  
  
""No, she's the one who'll regret it! Every time Eliana needs me, Yvonne threatens to break up. But in the end, she's the one who asks for forgiveness. This time won't be any different. I'll just leave her hanging.""  
  
""Enough. You're acting without thinking just because you know Yvonne loves you. But love doesn't last forever. I've got a bouquet of roses for you. Use it to apologize to Yvonne later.""  
  
Upon hearing that, Yvonne took a deep breath and opened the door.  
  
Sean quickly stood up, smiling. ""Yvonne, I'm so glad you came.""  
  
Knowing that his bar was about to open, she had already brought a gift.  
  
""Congratulations on the opening,"" she said, handing it to him.  
  
Sean took it with a smile. ""Thank you.""  
  
He signaled to Zaid and then turned to Yvonne. ""Have a seat. I'll go greet the other guests.""  
  
""No, thanks,"" Yvonne replied, following him outside. ""I'll come back to support you another day.""  
  
""Yvonne ... ""  
  
""Thanks for the invite,"" she said, smiling politely at Sean before turning to leave.  
  
Just as she reached the door, Zaid rushed after her. ""Yvonne, are you mad?""  
  
Yvonne ignored him and kept walking out.  
  
""I've explained everything! Don't push me too far!""  
  
Zaid blocked her way, looking impatient.  
  
Yvonne stared at him and sneered. ""I heard what you said in the room. I used to lower myself, thinking I was worthy of you. I was wrong. These eight years have been my punishment for my mistakes, but I won't make the same mistake again.""  
  
She tried to leave, but Zaid grabbed her wrist, his gaze intense.  
  
""Do you have to act like this?""  
  
""Let go of me!""  
  
Zaid tightened his grip, his eyes filled with anger. But then, he suddenly pulled her toward the car.  
  
""Zaid, I'm not getting in your car!""  
  
""Let's go home first!""  
  
""I won't!""  
  
""It looks like I've neglected you lately. You're even willing to break up with me! I'll make it up to you tonight. You won't be leaving the bed for the next two days!""

**Chapter 4 I Don't Love You Anymore**



Yvonne tried to pull Zaid's hand off, but he held her tightly from behind.  
  
She attempted to bite him, but he pinched her chin.  
  
Then, he shoved her into the car and told the driver to start driving.  
  
Levi, Zaid's driver who also knew Yvonne, glanced back and sensed the tension in the air.  
  
""Levi, he's crazy! Let me out!"" Yvonne begged.  
  
""Mr. Zaid, Ms. Scott is‚Äî""  
  
""Who are you listening to? Who pays your salary?"" Zaid snapped.  
  
Levi, sensing they were just having an argument and not wanting to get involved, quickly drove off.  
  
Yvonne couldn't break free, so she calmed herself down.  
  
""Zaid, I'm not arguing with you. We broke up already. There's no need to make things worse.""  
  
Zaid, filled with anger, scoffed. ""Break up? I don't agree!""  
  
""You're going to marry Eliana. Can't you just let me go?""  
  
""No!""  
  
""You‚Äî""  
  
Zaid tightened his grip around her and gritted his teeth. ""Remember when you wanted to have a baby with me? I'll make you pregnant tonight!""  
  
""You jerk!"" Yvonne yelled, turning around and slapping him. The car fell silent.  
  
Zaid stared at her in disbelief. ""How dare you hit me!""  
  
Tears burned in Yvonne's eyes, but she clenched her jaw to hold them back.  
  
He was the man she had loved for eight years, and now he could say such hurtful things to her, showing no respect.  
  
""Zaid, what do I mean to you? A maid, or some lowly hooker?""  
  
Zaid, furious from the slap, shot back, ""You know exactly who you are! Whether you're a maid or a hooker, it's your choice! You're the one who chased after me!""  
  
Yvonne stared at him for a long time before letting out a bitter smile.  
  
""You're right. I deserve it.""  
  
""You just want to marry me, don't you? Are you even worthy of that?""  
  
""I'm not.""  
  
""You ... I know you're jealous of Eliana. Can you even compare to her?""  
  
""I can't.""  
  
""You ... you..."" Zaid stammered, growing more agitated.  
  
Yvonne, growing calmer, watched as his frustration grew.  
  
""You let me sleep with you for free for eight years! Do you think any man will want you now?"" he shouted.  
  
""So in your eyes, am I already worthless?""  
  
Zaid clenched his jaw. ""Yes, you're nothing but trash!""  
  
Yvonne nodded.  
  
At that moment, she felt completely clear-headed and thankful. She finally saw Zaid for who he truly was.  
  
Eight years wasn't short, but she still had many more years ahead of her.  
  
With that thought, Yvonne laughed.  
  
""What's so funny?"" Zaid growled.  
  
She looked at him with a smile. ""Zaid, from now on, I don't love you anymore.""  
  
Zaid went silent. Yvonne had threatened to leave him before, but she had never said she didn't love him anymore.  
  
""Levi, please pull over,"" Yvonne told the driver.  
  
Levi, who had stayed quiet, hesitated. ""Ms. Scott, we're still on the highway.""  
  
Yvonne didn't want to get off on the highway just to vent her anger. ""Then drop me off after the highway.""  
  
At that moment, Zaid's phone rang. His anger softened when he saw it was Eliana calling.  
  
Eliana explained she was on set, but paparazzi had surrounded the area. She needed him to pick her up.  
  
""Alright, I'll be right there!"" Zaid said, hanging up. He told Levi to head toward Northville at the next intersection.  
  
Yvonne frowned. Her house was in Southville District.  
  
""Levi, please pull off the highway and drop me off,"" she said.  
  
""Stop the car and let her out,"" Zaid ordered, his patience thinning.  
  
Levi hesitated. ""But this is the highway‚Äî""  
  
""I said stop the car!"" Zaid barked.  
  
Levi had no choice but to stop the car in the emergency lane.  
  
Zaid pushed Yvonne out of the vehicle. As she regained her balance, she realized her bag was still inside.  
  
She turned to see the car speeding away, disappearing into the distance.  
  
The highway was crowded with cars due to rush hour. Yvonne started walking along the side of the road toward the nearest exit, surrounded by honking horns and drivers yelling at her from their windows.  
  
After over an hour of walking, she finally reached the end of the highway. But with no phone or money, she had no choice but to continue walking home.  
  
The cold night wind made her shiver as she wrapped herself tightly in her clothes.  
  
With fewer cars on the road, she reached a corner, where a drunk man tried to grab her. She clenched her teeth and sprinted as quickly as she could, only to stumble and scrape her knee.  
  
Despite the pain, she couldn't stop and limped away until she managed to shake the drunk man off.  
  
Her villa was on the outskirts of the city. When she reached it, the sun was already beginning to rise.  
  
The soft glow of light coming from the house made her pause before knocking on the door.  
  
Eliana was the one who answered the door. Her hair was messy, and she was wearing a low-cut nightgown.  
  
When she saw Yvonne standing there, she exclaimed, ""Why are you back so late?""  
  
Yvonne frowned, confused as to why Eliana was at her house.  
  
""What are you doing here?"" she asked.  
  
Eliana blinked and replied, ""Zaid brought me here.""  
  
Yvonne walked past her and entered the house, only to bump into Zaid, who was coming out of the kitchen holding a steaming plate of pasta.  
  
She hadn't known he could cook.  
  
Once, when Yvonne was sick with a fever and sweating heavily, Zaid came home late from work, complaining that he was hungry and demanding she cook for him.  
  
Feeling helpless, she had said, ""If you don't like eating out, why not learn to cook? You can't starve when I'm not here, right?""  
  
He hugged her and stubbornly replied, ""I won't learn. I want you to cook for me forever.""  
  
Yvonne couldn't help but smile sadly at the memory.  
  
The truth was that Eliana was his true priority, and she was just someone to serve him. After all, he would never cook for a maid.  
  
Zaid shot her a cold look before leading Eliana to the living room. He placed the pasta on the table and then gave Eliana a cushion to lean against.  
  
""I'm not hungry."" Eliana pouted.  
  
""You need to eat. Breakfast is important,"" Zaid insisted, picking up the plate to feed her.  
  
Eliana reluctantly tried a bite, shook her head, and said, ""It's too salty.""  
  
""Really?"" Zaid tasted it, then nodded. ""It's indeed too salty. I'll make a fresh plate.""  
  
He didn't mind the extra effort and quickly went back to the kitchen to cook again.  
  
Yvonne was exhausted and just wanted to lie down for a nap.  
  
She made her way to the bedroom, only to find it in disarray‚Äîthe bed was unmade, the pillow on the floor, and Eliana's clothes were hanging on the hanger while her clothes were carelessly tossed on a chair nearby.  
  
Suppressing her anger, Yvonne went downstairs and asked, ""Who slept in my room last night?""  
  
Zaid glanced at her and replied, ""From now on, Eliana will live here.""  
  
""This is my house. I didn't agree to that,"" she said sharply.  
  
He frowned. ""This is my house, not yours. My decision is what matters.""  
  
Yvonne's expression stiffened.  
  
Zaid was right. The house did belong to him.  
  
After university, she rented a place, but Zaid thought it was too small, so he asked her to move in with him.  
  
Even though she didn't pay rent regularly, she covered all the other household expenses. She didn't owe him anything.  
  
Eliana smiled and said, ""Zaid and I are planning to renovate this place into a new home. We can set up a room for you.""  
  
""No need!"" Yvonne snapped.  
  
She immediately went upstairs, grabbed a suitcase, packed her things, and came downstairs, ready to leave.  
  
""Yvonne, I don't have the patience to let you make a scene. If you leave with your luggage, we're done for good. There's no coming back,"" Zaid said through gritted teeth.  
  
Yvonne was already standing by the door. At his words, she turned around, looked him straight in the eye, and placed the keys on the shoe cabinet.

Chapter 1: Exposure

The chemicals swirled like dark dreams across the photograph, revealing layers of life hidden beneath the surface. Elena Rodriguez moved with practiced precision, her hands steady despite the nervous energy coursing through her veins. Red light bathed the small darkroom, transforming the cramped space into a sanctuary of visual storytelling.

Another print emerged ‚Äì an elderly woman sitting on a fire escape, her weathered hands clutching a cup of coffee, eyes fixed on something beyond the frame. Elena recognized Mrs. Ramirez from down the block, a woman who had survived more than most could imagine.

""Perfection isn't about capturing everyone's smile,"" her mentor Miguel had once told her. ""It's about revealing the truth that lives between breaths.""

The clock read 2:37 AM. Outside, the Lower East Side hummed with a restless energy that never truly slept. Elena pinned the latest print to dry, stepping back to assess her work. Each photograph was a fragment of a larger narrative ‚Äì her narrative.

A soft knock interrupted her concentration.

""Come in,"" she called, carefully not moving to disturb the developing images.

Her younger brother Roberto pushed open the door, bringing with him a gust of late-night city air. ""Again? Mom's going to have something to say about you being out this late.""

Elena rolled her eyes. ""Mom has something to say about everything.""

Roberto leaned against the doorframe, his tall frame blocking what little additional light might have entered. ""The newspaper called. Again.""

She didn't need to ask which newspaper or what they wanted. Rejection had become as familiar to her as the chemical smell of the darkroom. ""And?""

""They said your portfolio is 'interesting' but not what they're looking for right now."" He emphasized the word ""interesting"" with air quotes, a gesture that made Elena smile despite herself.

""Interesting is code for 'we don't understand,'"" she responded, carefully moving another photograph onto the drying rack.

The image captured a group of children playing soccer in a makeshift court between tenement buildings. Their joy was uncontainable ‚Äì a moment of pure freedom that transcended the economic limitations surrounding them.

""You're going to make it,"" Roberto said, his voice carrying a mixture of certainty and hope. ""Mam√° just wants you to have a stable job. You know how she worries.""

Elena knew all too well. Stable meant teaching. Stable meant marriage. Stable meant becoming someone else entirely.

""Photojournalism is stable,"" she argued, not for the first time. ""Just not in the way she imagines.""

Her current project was more than just photographs. It was a documentation of resilience ‚Äì Puerto Rican communities in New York navigating a world that often seemed designed to push them to the margins. Each image told a story of survival, of dignity maintained against overwhelming odds.

Roberto approached, studying the photographs with a critical eye. Unlike their mother, he understood Elena's vision. ""These are powerful,"" he murmured.

The moment was interrupted by the sound of a police siren cutting through the night. Both siblings tensed instinctively ‚Äì a reaction born from years of living in a neighborhood where official protection felt more like a threat.

""I have a meeting with a small independent magazine tomorrow,"" Elena said, breaking the tension. ""They're interested in a photo essay about community resilience.""

""Independent magazine sounds like code for 'we can't pay you much,'"" Roberto teased.

""Recognition isn't always about money,"" she retorted. ""Sometimes it's about being seen. Really seen.""

As the photographs continued to dry, Elena reflected on her journey. At twenty-five, she had already fought more battles than most. Being a woman. Being Puerto Rican. Being a photographer who refused to sanitize reality.

Her camera was her weapon. Her darkroom, her war room.

The images before her were more than just visual records. They were testimonies. Declarations of existence in a world that constantly tried to render certain communities invisible.

""I'm making them see us,"" she whispered, more to herself than to Roberto.

Her brother seemed to understand. He squeezed her shoulder ‚Äì a gesture of solidarity that needed no words.

As dawn began to break, casting its first tentative light through the small window, Elena knew her day was just beginning. The photographs would need to be sorted, prepared, pitched. Another round of potential rejections awaited.

But something burned inside her. A conviction that went beyond mere professional ambition. This was about representation. About truth.

""Get some sleep,"" Roberto said, sensing her determination. ""You can't change the world if you're exhausted.""

Elena laughed. ""Changing the world takes exactly that ‚Äì exhaustion and persistence.""

After Roberto left, she returned to her photographs. Each one a battle. Each one a story. Each one a piece of a larger truth she was determined to tell.

The city outside continued its endless dance ‚Äì Puerto Rican families preparing for work, children getting ready for school, street vendors setting up their stands. Another day in the Lower East Side was beginning.

And Elena Rodriguez would be there to capture it, one frame at a time.

# Chapter 2: Academic Dreams

Sarah's fingers crashed against the typewriter keys, each strike a tiny rebellion against the academic world that sought to silence her. Through the window of her library carrel, Columbia University's autumn painted itself in gold and red, leaves drifting like memories waiting to be captured. But her world lived entirely in the words emerging on the page before her, a landscape of hidden histories and unspoken truths.

""Tell it right this time,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible above the rhythmic clacking. She was surrounded by her fortress of forbidden books - underground lesbian magazines brittle with age, feminist manifestos dog-eared and marginalia-filled, protest pamphlets that crackled with defiance. This was her ammunition in a war against academic silence, against the institutional erasure of queer women's experiences.

The keys clicked out another line: ""In 1956, Maria held Sofia's hand beneath a Greenwich Village table, their love hidden by tablecloth and shadow, a moment of intimacy stolen between the harsh judgment of a world that refused to see them.""

A throat cleared behind her. The sound was deliberate, calculating. Sarah's shoulders tensed, her spine straightening with a mix of anticipation and resistance.

""Quite the reading list, Ms. Cohen."" Professor Thompson's voice dripped with academic disdain, each word carefully enunciated to convey maximum disapproval. He lifted a dog-eared copy of ""Sapphic Voices"" like it might contaminate his immaculate tweed jacket, holding it between two fingers as if it were something distasteful.

""Primary sources,"" Sarah met his gaze without blinking. Two years of graduate school had taught her not to flinch, to stand her ground in a world that constantly sought to push her to the margins. ""Direct testimony from the women who lived it. Who survived it.""

""Your dissertation proposal-"" he paused, his mustache twitching with barely contained frustration, ""it's raising significant concerns among the committee.""

""Because it's true?"" The words escaped before she could catch them, sharp as a blade. She knew the risk - knew how dangerous such directness could be in the hallowed halls of academia.

Thompson's face hardened, the lines around his eyes deepening. ""Because it lacks academic distance. These personal narratives, these... underground publications. They're hardly what we would consider scholarly sources.""

The door creaked open - a blessed interruption that momentarily broke the tension. Rebecca Chen appeared, bearing coffee and an aura of quiet rebellion, her sociology textbooks tucked under one arm like shields against institutional narrow-mindedness.

""Saving you from the academic abyss,"" she announced, waiting for Thompson to leave before settling into the adjacent chair. Her eyes held a knowing humor. ""He looked extra pompous today.""

Sarah grabbed the coffee like a lifeline, the warmth spreading through her hands. ""Apparently documenting lesbian history threatens the foundations of scholarly inquiry.""

""God forbid marginalized voices speak for themselves,"" Rebecca muttered, peering at the manuscript pages. ""How's Maria's story coming?""

""Raw. Beautiful. Terrifying."" Sarah pushed the latest draft forward, her fingers tracing the typed lines. ""She photographed the first protests, you know? While cops were swinging batons, breaking bones and spirits, she kept shooting. Kept witnessing. Kept proving we existed.""

The typewriter hummed between them, a machine of memory and resistance. Sarah's fingers found the keys again: ""They called them deviant, dangerous, sick. Maria answered with her camera, showing their humanity frame by frame, challenging every lie society had constructed about their existence.""

""Your mother called,"" Rebecca said quietly, a gentle interruption.

Sarah's hands stilled. ""Let me guess - nice Jewish boys and teaching jobs?""

""She wants you safe.""

""She wants me normal."" Sarah's laugh held no humor, just a sharp edge of understanding. ""Should I tell her about the women I'm interviewing? Their courage? Their scars? The way they built communities in the shadows, created families when the world denied them that right?""

Outside, students streamed between classes, following paths laid out in college brochures, their futures seemingly predetermined. Sarah watched them, remembering when life seemed that simple - before she understood the complexity of identity, of love, of resistance.

""The committee's going to fight this,"" Rebecca said, gentle but honest.

""Let them."" Sarah turned back to her typewriter, her resolve hardening like steel. ""These stories deserve to be told. The raids, the resistance, the love that survived despite everything.""

Her current chapter captured a hidden romance from 1950s New York, pieced together from late-night interviews with women who'd risked everything for love, for authenticity, for the simple human right to be seen.

""Sofia wore red lipstick to their secret meetings,"" Sarah typed, the words burning true. ""A flash of color in their gray world of hiding, a small act of defiance against a society that would rather they disappeared.""

Rebecca squeezed her shoulder before leaving. ""Don't let Thompson win.""

Sarah worked until sunset painted her pages gold, the library carrel transforming into a sanctuary of memory and hope. Women's stories rarely fit academic outlines. They spilled over margins, defied categorization, insisted on their own truth with a fierceness that could not be contained.

The typewriter's rhythm steadied her heartbeat. Each word a brick in the foundation she was building, a home for voices long silenced, a testament to survival and love.

Professor Thompson could keep his scholarly distance. Sarah chose intimacy, chose truth, chose to tell these stories the way they deserved - with love and rage and pride.

Her fingers struck the keys with renewed purpose. Another page emerged, another voice rescued from history's shadows.

# I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""

# 

# ""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""

# 

# ""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.



""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.



I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.



""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""



""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""



I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.



The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.



Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

That was before everything fell apart.



My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.



But everything changed the night of the setup.



I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.



Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.



Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.



What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.



I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.



""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but‚Ä¶ we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""



I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.



""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.



""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.



Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.



""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.



I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.



The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.



There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.



I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.



""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.



I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.



She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.



My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.



She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.



She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.



""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.



""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""



My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.



Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.



""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""



Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.



I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?



""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""



Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""



Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.



""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.



I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.



As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.



Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""



I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.



Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""



A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.



When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.



...

Olivia's POV



Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.



The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.



But that was before.



Before everything fell apart.



Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.



""Who cleaned my room yesterday?"" Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.



I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. ""I did.""



Lennox's expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.



""Then tell me, Omega,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, ""where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?""



I froze, my heart racing as Lennox's words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.



""I‚Ä¶ I didn't see any necklace,"" I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.



Lennox's eyes narrowed. ""Don't lie to me, Omega,"" he growled, his tone laced with anger. ""The necklace didn't just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.""



""I'm not lying!"" I protested, panic creeping into my voice. ""I cleaned the room, but I didn't take anything. I swear!""



He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. ""You expect me to believe that?"" he snapped. ""You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.""



His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.



""I didn't take it,"" I repeated, my voice steadier this time. ""You can search me if you don't believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.""



Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.



I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers' pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.



Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.



""I can't find it, Olivia. It's gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?"" he asked in anger.



I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. ""I did not take it‚Ä¶""



""Lies!"" he angrily cut me off.





Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. ""This doesn't make sense,"" he muttered. ""You cleaned my room. You were the last one here."" His gaze hardened. ""Don't lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?""



When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.



""You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!"" he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.



Lennox's words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn't matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.



""Only two people came into this room yesterday,"" Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. ""You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?""



I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.



I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior's silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha's Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.



Who would dare enter Lennox's room and steal something so valuable?



No one.



No one except Anita.



But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn't say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I'd only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.



""I didn't take it,"" I said again.



Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. ""You think I'm stupid, don't you?""



I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn't. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn't matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.



""You know what, Olivia?"" Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. ""I'm done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn't turn up by the end of the day, I'll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.""



His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. ""I didn't take it,"" I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.



Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. ""I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,"" he growled.



I didn't need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.



Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn't believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.



""Here you are, Olivia,"" a guard said as he walked over to me. ""Levi is looking for you, and he doesn't seem happy.""



The guard's announcement made my heart sink in fear.



""Why? What happened?"" I asked, terrified.



Joshua, the guard, shook his head. ""I don't know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.""



Shit! What could it be this time?



...

Olivia's POV



""Start talking, Olivia‚Ä¶ before I lose my patience,"" Levi demanded, his voice laced with anger.



I stood frozen, unable to form words as I struggled to process the accusation. Again. I was being accused of stealing‚Äîagain.



""Olivia!"" His voice thundered through the room. ""Don't make me lose my patience! Where is the bundle of dollar notes I kept in my drawer? Speak, you thief!""



My eyes widened in shock. But Before I could respond, the door to Levi's room burst open, and Louis stormed in, seething with rage.



""Olivia, where is the money I kept in my drawer?"" Louis demanded.



I took a step back, my breath hitching as both Levi and Louis glared at me with fiery rage. My heart pounded in my chest‚Äînot out of guilt, but out of sheer disbelief. This wasn't happening. Not again.



""I didn't take anything,"" I managed to say, my voice trembling.



Levi scoffed, running a frustrated hand through his hair. ""Really? Then tell us who else could have taken it. Who else enters our room if not you?""



Louis folded his arms, his frown deepening. ""Don't play innocent, Olivia. Just return the money and save us all the drama.""



Tears gathered in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. At least not now.



Swallowing the lump in my throat, I forced myself to speak. ""I didn't take your money,"" I repeated, louder this time, my voice shaking with suppressed emotion. ""I would never steal from any of you.""



""Liar!""



I flinched at the new voice and turned to see Lennox standing at the doorway. His eyes, filled with cold hatred, locked onto mine.



""The necklace I bought for Anita is missing too,"" he announced, turning to his brothers.



All three of them‚ÄîLevi, Louis, and Lennox‚Äîlooked at me as if I were the worst kind of filth.



Levi was the first to walk toward me, and out of panic, I tried to run away, but it was useless. I was surrounded by the triplets.



Levi pinned me against the wall, lifting my hands above my head while his burning glare was staring right into my eyes.



""This is your last chance to confess and return what you stole, or you'll be dealt with accordingly,"" he threatened.



A tear slid down my cheek as I met his angry gaze. I knew, regardless of what I said, they would never believe that I didn't steal from them. They would never believe that their precious Anita was the one stealing from them.



""One‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶"" Levi began counting, and all I could do was shed more tears.



I sobbed silently, knowing the punishment for stealing in this household was brutal. Some thieves were thrown into the dungeons, like my father. Others had their hands chopped off. Some faced even worse fates.



As Levi counted, my mind raced. Would I end up like my father, rotting in a dungeon? Or worse?



""Ten.""



He released my wrists and took a step back.



""She's just like her father‚Äîa stubborn thief,"" Lennox sneered. More tears slipped down my cheeks.



""Guards! Bring some maids!"" Louis ordered sharply.



As we waited for the arrival of the maids, my heart raced in my chest. What were these men going to do to me? Why were they sending for maids?



My gaze met Lennox's, and he glared at me with so much hate, which made me wonder‚Äîdid he really hate me just because my father was accused of stealing? Was this all about it, or was there something else involved? How could a man who once cherished me now look at me with such disgust?



Three maids walked in and bowed their heads to the triplets.



Levi was the one to usher the punishment. ""Take her to the mansion rooftop. Strip her and apply pepper to her naked body. Make sure she kneels under the sun.""



A tear slid down my cheek, but I didn't say a word. Compared to what was done to anyone accused of stealing, this was a lesser punishment for me.



""Take her away,"" Lennox demanded coldly.



The maids took hold of my arms and led me out of the room. I didn't struggle. There was no point. As we walked through the mansion, I saw my mother. She was sobbing, her entire body trembling, but she didn't dare approach me. If she did, she'd share my punishment.



When we reached the rooftop, the maids let go of me.



""Please undress,"" one of them urged softly.



I hesitated, my entire body trembling, but there was no escape. Swallowing hard, I began removing my clothes, my tears falling freely.



One of the maids picked up a bowl of ground pepper and moved closer. My body tensed.



The moment the first handful of pepper touched my skin, an agonized scream tore from my lips. My body convulsed as the fiery sting spread across my skin. They rubbed it everywhere‚Äîevery inch of my exposed flesh except for my face. The burning sensation was unbearable. My knees buckled, but I forced myself to stay upright.



""You have to kneel,"" one of the maids said.



I hesitated, but my body was already giving in. Slowly, I sank to my knees, my sobs wracking my entire being. The scorching sun hit down on me, intensifying the torment. My entire body felt like it was on fire.



How could anyone be so cruel?



I wanted to scream, to beg for the pain to stop, but I knew it would only make things worse.



It was as if the sun was against me because it began to heat even more. My whole body was burning with pain, and it felt like I would pass out soon. The pain was unbearable. I had never imagined I would go through such torture.



With tear-filled eyes, I looked at the maids who stood in a corner, staring at me with pity. Painful tears trickled down my cheeks while my entire body burned. As the excruciating pain enveloped me, my vision blurred, and my head spun.



Painful memories flashed through my mind. The triplets used to adore me. They used to fight over who got to spend more time with me. They used to playfully argue about which one of them would marry me when we grew up.



How did everything change so drastically?



How did men who once cherished me suddenly hate me so much?



I wished my father hadn't been framed. I wished he had been proven innocent. Then, maybe‚Ä¶ maybe, the triplets wouldn't hate me this much.



The fiery sting of the pepper intensified, searing every inch of my exposed skin. I struggled to remain upright, my knees weakening beneath me. With each agonizing breath, the world seemed to tilt and sway until, finally, I could no longer fight the overwhelming sensation of nausea and torment.



My body gave way, and I crumpled to the ground. Distant voices called my name, but I was already slipping into darkness, into the past. Into the days when the triplets swore they'd protect me. Back when they fought over who would marry me, not who would break me. But those boys were gone. And so was I.



...

Lennox's POV



An uncomfortable silence hung in the air as neither my brothers nor I spoke. The tension was thick, almost suffocating. An uneasy feeling settled in my chest as my thoughts drifted to Olivia‚Äîto the pain she might be going through. A part of me wanted to stop the punishment, to let it go. But if I did, it would show weakness, a soft spot for her. And I didn't want that. I couldn't afford that. Not after what she did to me.



""I wonder what she plans to do with all the things she stole,"" Levi spat, his voice sharp with anger, breaking the silence.



I turned to look at him, noticing the anger in his eyes. He was just as pissed as I was.



""Maybe she has a boyfriend she plans to give them to,"" Louis grunted.



The mere thought of that sent a sharp, uncomfortable pain through my chest, but I shoved it down and stood abruptly. ""Tell the guards to search her things. Perhaps they're still in her room.""



Without waiting for a response, I left the room, heading back to mine.



The mess I had created in my earlier frustration still littered in my room‚Äîbroken glass, overturned furniture, scattered papers. I ignored it and walked straight to the minibar, grabbing a bottle of whiskey. Uncorking it, I took a long swig, feeling the burn slide down my throat.



With a sigh, I sank onto the bed, but no matter how hard I tried, my thoughts kept drifting back to Olivia. The punishment she was enduring on the rooftop. I glanced at the window‚Äîthe sun was scorching.



""If you're so worried about her, then stop the punishment."" My wolf's voice rumbled in my head.



I clenched my jaw. ""Why should I? Did she think about how I felt years ago when she hurt me? When she said those things?""



The door to my room pushed open, and Anita stepped inside. Her brows furrowed as she took in the mess in my room before her gaze landed on the whiskey bottle in my hand.



""Lennox, are you drinking because of the missing necklace?"" she asked, concern lacing her voice.



I swallowed hard. No. The necklace wasn't why I was drowning myself in whiskey. It was Olivia. But I couldn't say that to Anita.



""Yes. It was a gift for you,"" I murmured instead.



Anita sighed and walked closer, kneeling before me. Gently, she took the bottle from my hand and placed it aside before looking directly into my eyes.



""You don't have to do this to yourself over a necklace. You can always get me another one, right?"" she said, her voice soft, comforting.



And she was right. Money wasn't the issue. My brothers and I were the sons of the richest Alpha in the world and soon to be Alphas. A stolen diamond necklace shouldn't be enough to put me in this mood.



""Or‚Ä¶"" Anita tilted her head, her gaze searching mine. ""Is there something else bothering you?"" Anita asked, raising a suspicious brow.



I quickly shook my head.



She studied me for a moment before a slow smirk curled her lips. ""I know exactly what you need.""



Before I could ask what she meant, she reached for the hem of her dress and pulled it over her head, letting the fabric fall to the floor. My gaze traveled over her exposed skin, the smooth curves of her body.



""Come on,"" she whispered, her voice sultry. ""Let me help you take out your frustration.""



I said nothing as she unclasped her bra, letting it slide off her shoulders. Then, she moved closer, pressing her body against mine. Her hands traced down my chest, her fingers slowly unbuttoning my shirt before pushing it off.



""Use me, Lennox,"" she breathed, tilting her head up to meet my gaze. ""Pour all your anger into me. Take what you need.""



A dark hunger stirred inside me‚Äîthe need to lose myself, to forget everything‚Äîeven if just for a moment. I grabbed the back of her neck, pulling her into a bruising kiss. She gasped against my lips, but I didn't slow down. I pushed her back onto the bed, climbing over her, my body pressing her into the mattress. I ran hungry and angry kisses all over her body before pulling away and standing before her.



Anita lay back on the bed, her legs spread, her body on full display for me. Her smirk was teasing, her eyes dark with anticipation. She knew what I wanted‚Äîwhat I needed‚Äîand she was more than willing to give it to me.



I didn't waste time. My belt hit the floor with a sharp clink, and I shoved my pants down, my cock already hard and aching. I crawled onto the bed, grabbing Anita's ankles and yanking her closer, making her gasp in surprise.



""So rough, so dominant,"" she purred, but I wasn't in the mood for her teasing.



I wrapped my fingers around her throat, squeezing just enough to make her gasp. ""Shut up,"" I growled, watching her eyes widen with excitement.



Her lips parted, her breath hitching as I tightened my grip just a little more. ""Yes, Master,"" she whispered.



That sent a dark thrill through me. I released her throat and grabbed her hips, flipping her onto her stomach in one swift motion. She barely had time to brace herself before I yanked her up onto her knees, positioning her exactly how I wanted.



I ran a hand down her spine, feeling her shiver under my touch. ""You're wet already,"" I noted darkly, dragging my fingers through her slick folds.



She whimpered, pressing back against me, silently begging for more.



But I wasn't feeling generous tonight.



I grabbed a fistful of her hair, yanking her head back as I aligned myself with her entrance. ""Beg for it,"" I commanded.



She moaned, her fingers gripping the sheets. ""Please, Master,"" she gasped. ""I need you.""



That was all I needed.



With one hard thrust, I slammed into her, making her cry out. I didn't give her time to adjust‚ÄîI didn't want to. I set a brutal pace from the start, pounding into her relentlessly. The bed frame creaked beneath us, the sound of skin slapping against skin filling the room.



Anita moaned loudly, her body rocking forward with every thrust, but I pulled her back against me, keeping her exactly where I wanted. My grip on her hips was bruising, my nails digging into her flesh as I took her hard and rough, just the way I needed.



""Who do you belong to?"" I growled, yanking her head back again.



""You, Lennox,"" she panted, her voice breaking with pleasure. ""Only you.""



I smirked darkly. ""Damn right.""



I released her hair and pressed her chest down onto the mattress, driving deeper into her. My control was slipping, my wolf growling as I fucked her like an animal.



She was screaming now, her body shuddering beneath me, but I didn't stop. I couldn't stop. Not until I had taken everything I wanted from her.



And I wasn't done yet.



Anita's body trembled beneath me, her moans filling the room as I drove into her relentlessly. But no matter how hard I took her, no matter how much she screamed my name, it wasn't enough.



Because it wasn't her.



I clenched my jaw, trying to push the thought away, but it was useless. My mind betrayed me, painting a different picture. It wasn't Anita's dark hair spilling over her shoulders‚Äîit was Olivia's. It wasn't Anita's moans filling my ears‚Äîit was Olivia's breathless whimpers, the way I knew she'd sound if I ever had her like this.



""Lennox‚Ä¶"" Anita gasped, her voice breaking with pleasure as she arched her back, pressing against me. But for a moment, I didn't hear Anita. I heard Olivia.



A violent need surged through me. I pulled out of her suddenly, making her whimper at the loss. Before she could protest, I flipped onto my back and grabbed her by the waist, pulling her over me.



""Ride me,"" I ordered, my voice rough with need.



Anita grinned, straddling me eagerly. She reached down, positioning herself before sinking onto my cock with a moan. Her head fell back, her nails digging into my chest as she took me deep.



I gritted my teeth, my hands gripping her hips tightly as she began to move. But I wasn't watching Anita anymore.



I was watching Olivia.



In my mind, it was her above me, her red lips parted in breathless pleasure. It was her soft skin beneath my hands, her tight pussy wrapped around me.



""Fuck,"" I growled, my grip tightening. I drove my hips up hard, making Anita cry out. But all I saw was Olivia.



How would she look like this? Would she be shy? Would she try to fight the pleasure, or would she surrender to it completely?



I imagined her whimpering my name, her nails dragging down my chest as she came apart for me.



A low, possessive growl rumbled from my chest. Olivia wasn't supposed to be in my head like this. She wasn't supposed to be the one I craved. I hated her. She had hurt me, but I couldn't stop thinking about her.



And no matter how hard I tried, no matter how many times I fucked Anita or anyone else, no one could take her place.



Anita's pace quickened, her nails scraping against my chest as she rode me harder, chasing her release. My grip on her hips was firm, guiding her movements, but my mind was elsewhere.



Not here. Not with her.



With Olivia.



I could almost see her‚Äîimagine the way her body would tremble above me, the way her lips would part in a gasp as she took me deep. My control slipped at the thought, my grip tightening as I thrust up into Anita with brutal force.



""Lennox‚Äî"" Anita gasped, her body tensing. She was close.



I was too.



With one last punishing thrust, I sent her over the edge. Her body clenched around me as she cried out, shuddering in pleasure. The sensation pushed me past my limit, and with a low growl, I let go.



Pleasure ripped through me, my release spilling into the condom as I buried myself deep inside her. My breathing was heavy, my chest rising and falling as I rode out the aftershocks.



For a brief moment, silence filled the room, broken only by Anita's soft panting.



Then, without a word, I reached down and pulled out of her. My body was still humming with satisfaction, but the moment was already fading.



Because it wasn't Olivia.



It never was.



Anita stretched beside me, her fingers lazily trailing down my chest. ""Damn, that was hot,"" she breathed.



I didn't respond. Instead, I reached over and pulled her into my arms. For a moment, we didn't say a word until the door opened and Levi and Louis walked in.



""So you two were having fun without us,"" Louis said, and Anita, loving the attention, giggled softly.



""Move away, Lennox,"" Levi grumbled.



I sighed and rolled out of bed as Levi and Louis positioned themselves beside Anita, wasting no time before devouring her like hungry animals.



I moved away from the bed, walking into the bathroom and turning on the shower. As I stood under the cold water, I could still hear the muffled moans coming from my room.



My brothers and I did practically everything together. We shared everything‚Äîso sharing Anita, or any other woman, was nothing new. But we also competed against each other.



Who was the best fighter.

The strongest wolf.

The fastest shifter.



Sometimes, it even came down to who fucked better. Who Anita enjoyed more.



And most importantly‚Äîwho would end up being her mate.



We all knew that on her eighteenth birthday, she would be mated to one of us. And if fate was cruel enough, to all three of us.



And whoever she was mated to would be Dad's favorite. The pack's favored Alpha.



So, in a way, we were all competing for her.



But that didn't mean we didn't love each other.



Sighing heavily, I thought of Olivia, of the good memories I had of her. Of how I fell in love with her even as just a little boy of twelve. How I competed with my brothers, assuming they liked her too.



As we grew older, I thought she liked me too.



But I was wrong. So damn wrong.



Turning off the shower, I tied a towel around my waist and walked back into the room.



Back in my room, I found Levi and Louis fucking Anita dominantly. She was on her knees, Levi's cock in her mouth while Louis fucked her from behind.



Their moans filled the air, but I ignored them, walking over to grab a pair of simple track pants. I needed a run. I needed to clear my head.



I pulled them on and left the room without another word.



But just as I stepped into the hallway, a female servant rushed up to me, looking panicked.



""Young master, Olivia just fainted on the rooftop,"" she announced, her voice trembling.



My breath caught. Panic surged through me, but I forced myself to stay composed.



""Then wake her up and send her back in,"" I said, sounding nonchalant as I hid my worry.



""That's the problem,"" the servant insisted.

""We've tried waking her, but she's not responding.""



I furrowed my brow, my frown deepening. ""What do you mean?""



She swallowed hard, her eyes wide with fear. ""She's not breathing.""",1,1747467684.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

**Alexander**

I‚Äôve often wondered what it‚Äôs like to be ordinary. To wake up without a schedule planned down to the minute, without the weight of centuries-old expectations pressing on your chest like an iron crown. I imagine it feels like breathing freely for the first time‚Äîbut then again, imagining is all I‚Äôve ever been allowed to do.

The morning began as it always does: early, cold, and mechanical. My valet, Gustaf, knocked sharply at the door before entering, carrying the day‚Äôs itinerary. ""Your Highness,"" he said with a crispness that never wavered, setting the document on my bedside table. The thick curtains were drawn open, letting in the faint glow of dawn. Outside, the Northern Lights still shimmered faintly, their colors fading as the sun began its slow ascent.

*Oh, coffee and my favorite kanelbulle? You shouldn‚Äôt have‚Ä¶*¬†The sarcastic thought flickered through my mind, a small rebellious contrast to the words that actually came out of my mouth.

""Thank you, Gustaf,"" I murmured, sitting up. The sheets were heavy, luxurious‚Äîthe kind only royalty could afford‚Äîbut they might as well have been chains. Another day, another performance.

As he helped me into my tailored suit‚Äîdark navy, perfectly fitted, with an understated gold tie‚ÄîGustaf briefed me on the first event of the day: the International Youth Environmental Forum. Held annually in Stockholm, the forum gathered young leaders, activists, and scholars from around the globe. This year, I had the dubious honor of delivering the opening speech.

The silk shirt clung smoothly to my chest, the fabric stretching ever so slightly over muscles honed through years of discipline in my private gym. Two hours every morning might seem excessive, but perfection demanded no less. The mirror across the room caught my reflection as Gustaf adjusted the tie, the deep blue accentuating my pale complexion and drawing attention to my turquoise eyes‚Äîthe one feature even my harshest critics couldn‚Äôt deny held a certain charm.

It wasn‚Äôt vanity, I told myself, as I ran a hand through my neatly styled blonde hair, inspecting the flawless result of my morning ritual.¬†*It‚Äôs image management*, I thought with a faint smirk.¬†*Royalty comes with a dress code‚Äîand I‚Äôm going to wear it well.*¬†In case all else fails‚Ä¶ I took a deep breath, trying to forget I was about to speak in front of a crowd.

‚ÄúThe world is watching, Your Highness,‚Äù Gustaf reminded me as he adjusted the cuffs of my shirt. His tone was not unkind, but it carried the weight of unspoken expectations. ‚ÄúYour father is particularly interested in the impression you‚Äôll leave on the attendees.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy father is always interested in impressions,‚Äù I replied dryly, earning a sharp glance from the older man. I offered him a slight smile to soften the remark. It wasn‚Äôt his fault; he was only doing his job. But it wasn‚Äôt mine, either. Being a prince wasn‚Äôt something I chose.

Breakfast was brief and solitary, as usual. A delicate spread of smoked salmon, lingonberry jam, and freshly baked bread sat untouched on the table. My appetite, apart from the sinful cinnamon buns I keep hoping for, had abandoned me years ago, replaced by a constant knot of nerves and duty. I sipped my coffee, staring out the grand window at the palace gardens. Snow dusted the evergreen hedges, and a thin layer of ice glinted on the fountains.

In everyone‚Äôs eyes, I lived on a beautiful postcard, with a picture-perfect family, in a dream-like world. But reality was far from royalty fairytales. Raised in the palace, I‚Äôd never gone to school with other children, never snuck out to a party‚Äîapart from society balls where every smile was scrutinized‚Äîand I‚Äôd only dated candidates deemed ""suitable"" for the royal throne. Real friendships? Real relationships? They were luxuries as foreign to me as the everyday life I sometimes imagined.

At my twenty-one years of age, freedom felt as distant as the stars.

The forum's venue was as grand as one might expect‚Äîan imposing hall lined with flags from every attending nation. Delegates filed in, their chatter a hum of various accents and languages. Cameras flashed as I stepped out of the royal motorcade, flanked by security. Smiles, waves, perfectly measured steps‚Äîevery movement was calculated for effect.

The opening ceremony was a blur of handshakes and introductions. When it was time for my speech, I stood at the podium, the lights glaring down like a tribunal. My prepared remarks were carefully written to inspire without offending, to sound passionate without stirring controversy.

‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen,‚Äù I began, my voice steady but hollow. ‚ÄúWe stand at a crossroads in history. The choices we make today will define the world we leave for future generations.‚Äù

Polite applause followed each rehearsed point. I spoke of sustainable innovation, cooperation, and hope. But even as the words left my mouth, I felt detached from them. They were not my own. They never were.

The crowd didn‚Äôt seem to notice‚Äîor mind it, if they did. Behind every polite glance, I imagined young men and women in my same position, fulfilling their boring duties by attending my unexciting presentation. I could feel their lack of interest in their unexpressive faces and absent glances.

And then, I saw him.

He sat near the middle of the audience, arms crossed, his posture exuding a kind of relaxed defiance. I recognized the Italian flag colors embroidered on his chest‚Äîhe was royalty, but of the most unusual kind. His dark eyes‚Äîsharp and unyielding‚Äîlocked onto mine, and for a moment, my carefully constructed fa√ßade wavered. His thick, raven-black hair fell casually over his forehead, a stark contrast to the polished perfection around him. He didn‚Äôt clap. He didn‚Äôt smile. He just watched me, unblinking, as if he could see through every pretense I‚Äôd spent years perfecting.

Curiosity struck first.¬†*Who the hell is this stranger who dares to look at a prince with such boldness?*¬†Then came the jealousy. He sat there, utterly unbothered by the weight of expectations, free to be whoever he chose. And beneath that, a pang of something deeper, something more unsettling: longing.

*What does he know about freedom?*¬†My mind whispered the question even as my chest tightened. It wasn‚Äôt fair‚Äîthis invisible rope he‚Äôd thrown around me with just a glance. I hated him for it. And yet, I couldn‚Äôt look away.

The rest of the speech passed in a haze. I stumbled over a line, earning a subtle frown from my father in the front row. When I finally concluded, the applause was polite but muted. As I stepped away from the podium, I stole another glance at him. He was whispering something to the woman beside him, a slight smirk playing on his lips. My chest tightened further, though I couldn‚Äôt say why.

Backstage, I leaned against the wall, exhaling sharply. My hands trembled as I loosened my tie. The forum was far from over, and already, I felt like I was losing control.

*What is wrong with you?*¬†Quite a monarch you‚Äôre preparing to be when it only takes one thing‚Äîor one stranger‚Äîto throw you off.

I pressed my palms against my temples, willing the thoughts to disappear. But his image lingered‚Äîthose dark eyes, that maddening confidence. Whoever he was, he‚Äôd unsettled something deep inside me.

And I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted it settled.

# Capter Two

**Leonardo**

I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt want to be here. Political conferences? Not my scene. Not even close. But of course, my darling mother‚Äîthe President of the Council of Ministers‚Äîinsisted I come. She didn‚Äôt say it outright, but her tone carried that unspoken command:¬†*Behave, Leonardo. Don‚Äôt embarrass me.*

Being a true rebel at heart, I always seemed to find myself getting dragged into these things, all in the name of keeping her precious image intact and avoiding yet another lecture about how I needed to be more responsible, more serious. Blah, blah, blah.

*As if.*

What she didn‚Äôt seem to understand was that I wasn‚Äôt cut from her stuffy, high-necked cloth. I was twenty-one, free, and damn proud of it. Life wasn‚Äôt a chessboard to me, all calculated moves and carefully placed pawns. It was art‚Äîmessy, unpredictable, and wild. A playground just begging for me to leave my mark on it. No plans, no rules, just me, the media spotlight, and a new adventure waiting at every corner.

Okay, maybe I had a thing for stirring the pot‚Ä¶.¬†*Just a little*. Was it my fault the press loved to make a spectacle of my ‚Äúreckless‚Äù lifestyle? And yeah, I did enjoy being in that spotlight a bit too much. The press ate it up. They loved the wild, charming Italian president‚Äôs son who had more fun than he could fit in his perfectly tailored suits. The fact that it drove my mother absolutely insane? Even better.

But no, today was about her, not me. Today, I had to sit through a conference I couldn‚Äôt care less about, listening to some uptight, stick-up-the-ass prince drone on about sustainable innovation or some other nonsense that had absolutely nothing to do with real life‚Äîor, more importantly, me.

I‚Äôd already checked the time twice, debated pretending to faint just for the drama of it, and was on the verge of texting my best friend to stage an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù when something‚Äîor rather, someone‚Äîcaught my attention.

I almost dropped my espresso.

Alexander. The Swedish Crown Prince.

*Holy hell.*

I‚Äôm not one for speeches, but the sight of this guy? It made my heart flutter for a second. His posture, that effortless yet refined elegance‚Äîeverything about him screamed perfection, like he was carved from marble and misplaced by a few centuries. He had this intensity about him that made everything else in the room fade into background noise.

And those eyes. Ice-blue, so cold and carefully controlled they could have frozen over the Mediterranean. I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder how much of him was real and how much was just a huge royal bullshit performance.

There he was, standing tall, completely unaware of the storm he was causing in my chest. His sharp jawline. That mess of dark blond hair that, despite being perfectly placed, still had that¬†*I woke up like this*¬†charm. His lips‚Ä¶ Damn, those lips. I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from imagining what they‚Äôd feel like against mine. Maybe bite them a little‚Ä¶.¬†*Or a lot.*

And there I was, objectifying Swedish royalty in a room full of diplomats. Not my finest moment.

And damn it, I was shameless in my thoughts.

It took everything in me to stop staring like some lovesick teenager. But I was stuck here, in this godforsaken room, at a table full of snobbish elites who had no idea how to live, let alone how to feel. They‚Äôd never get the allure of someone like Alexander. They probably thought he was just another pretty boy in a too-tight suit. But for me? Shit, it wasn‚Äôt nearly tight enough... I saw the way he was locked in this golden cage, struggling to breathe but doing it with such grace.

He‚Äôd seen me. I was sure of that, but somehow he‚Äôd moved on. Unusual. I leaned back in my seat, one arm draped casually over the chair next to me, my other hand lazily spinning my empty espresso cup on my lap, right over my slight bulge. It wasn‚Äôt about being subtle‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt. I wanted him to see me.

I caught his gaze for a split second, his blue eyes flicking toward the movement before returning to the moderator. But that moment was enough. I tilted my head slightly, offering the barest smirk, as if to say, Yes, I caught you staring.

His jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.¬†*Intriguing*. And, suddenly he lost his train of thought and stumbled over a line.

I almost laughed.¬†*Gotcha!*¬†But then I saw the look the man in the first raw gave him. I realized it was his father, the king, and I almost felt bad for the poor guy. Almost.

I was so damn sure he hated being there. Which made me want to make him feel something else.¬†*Everything*¬†else!

The debate was about to start, and I could already feel the excitement building inside me.¬†*Finally! A fun challenge.*

It had been a while since I‚Äôd been interested in a total stranger, but this one I wanted, and I‚Äôve never known how to play nice when I wanted something‚Äîor someone.

This wasn‚Äôt just about breaking him‚Äîit was about peeling back the layers. I wanted to see what was underneath that polished surface. Or that fancy suit‚Ä¶ Oh yeah, I totally wanted to see everything under that uniform. Have my cake and eat it too. I chuckled a little at the thought, then wondered if he might not share my sense of humor. He looked like the not-so-humorous type of guy.

Did he have a temper?¬†*Oh, he would look so sexy when angry*‚Ä¶ And that could be totally arranged. I wondered if there was a spark of rebellion buried somewhere deep.¬†*And if not, could I be the one to light that fire?*

Alexander started speaking, his voice as smooth as silk and twice as dangerous. The room fell silent, captivated by the same charm that had me biting the inside of my cheek to keep from smiling like an idiot.

Fuck the speech. In my head, we were already getting laid. It was a matter of time.

He didn‚Äôt know it yet, but he was going to fall for me.

I glanced at the other people around. Zero competition.¬†*Good*. None of these guys, or girls, I didn‚Äôt know which way he swang, had shit on me. The fact that most weren‚Äôt even drooling over him, was proof of it.

As Alexander‚Äôs speech was about to end, I let my eyes linger on him a little longer than I should have, daring him to notice me. He didn‚Äôt‚Äîyet. But I had time. I always did.

The debate began, and I got ready. Alexander¬†*would*¬†notice me.

I was going to eat him alive.",1,1747467631.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

# Understanding the Living Room Dining Room Combo

The contemporary approach to home design has increasingly favored the living room and dining room combination space, often referred to as a ""great room."" This layout merges two traditionally separate areas, enhancing the overall functionality and aesthetic appeal of a home. The appeal lies primarily in the seamless flow between spaces, which promotes interaction and engagement among family members and guests. In an age where open-concept living is on the rise, the integration of these two vital areas allows for multitasking without the hindrance of physical barriers.

One of the primary benefits of a living room and dining room combo is the enhancement of social interaction. With the removal of walls, these areas can accommodate larger gatherings, fostering a more inclusive environment. This design encourages an inviting atmosphere where hosts can communicate with their guests while preparing meals or serving drinks. In homes with limited square footage, this layout maximizes the use of space, providing a feeling of openness and airiness that smaller, compartmentalized rooms often lack.

However, merging living and dining areas does come with its challenges. The foremost consideration is achieving a cohesive design that maintains the unique character of each space. Selecting furniture and decor that complements both areas can be difficult; consequently, collaboration with skilled [**Interior designers in Ahmedabad**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-ahmedabad/)¬†becomes essential. These professionals can help ensure that the design remains functional and visually appealing. 

Homeowners must also consider effective zoning strategies, which may include the use of rugs, lighting, or furniture arrangements to define spaces within the combo area. Overall, while there are challenges to creating a living room and dining room combo, the advantages of improved flow and social connections outweigh the difficulties, making this layout a preferred choice for modern homeowners.

# Choosing a Color Palette

https://preview.redd.it/dw9nc72xpa1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6313c4f2b22f367a8788e7c380a884d8468ac3a9

The selection of a cohesive color palette is crucial for creating a harmonious living room and dining room combo. A well-thought-out color scheme can not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also provide a sense of continuity throughout the space. Interior designers in Ahmedabad emphasize the importance of color theory, which suggests that certain colors can evoke specific emotions, making the choice of hues even more significant in shared areas. For instance, calm neutrals, such as soft grays or beiges, can promote tranquility, while warm colors like soft yellows or gentle reds may create an inviting atmosphere.

When choosing complementary colors, consider the size and lighting of the combined space. Lighter colors tend to make a space feel larger and airier, while darker shades can add intimacy. By opting for shades that naturally complement each other, one can achieve a balanced look. For example, pairing a soft blue with a light cream can produce a refreshing yet warm ambiance, which is ideal for inviting social gatherings in this blended area. Furthermore, it is beneficial to select a primary color for the dominant elements, such as walls and large furniture, and then choose secondary colors for accents in smaller decor pieces.

Incorporating accent colors can also play a significant role in enhancing the overall ambiance. This can be achieved through decorative pillows, artwork, or dining accessories. Interior designers in Ahmedabad for home projects often recommend introducing various textures and patterns in accent colors, which can inject personality into the jointly used space without overwhelming it. With the right color palette, this combination can become a striking feature of any home design, showcasing the expertise of famous interior designers in Ahmedabad. By carefully considering color choices, you can ensure that your living and dining areas feel interconnected and cohesive.

# Selecting Furniture That Fits 

https://preview.redd.it/2jq0t951qa1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f1d7afebce000a80615d5ffb4422488a8cc58d7

When designing a living room and dining room combo, selecting the right furniture is crucial to achieve a harmonious and functional space. The first step is to consider the scale and proportions of each piece. Oversized furniture can quickly overwhelm a combined area, leading to a cluttered and uncomfortable setting. Therefore, selecting furniture that complements the dimensions of the space is essential. For instance, consider lightweight furniture that can easily be rearranged, such as a slim-profile sofa or a round dining table, which can enhance traffic flow without sacrificing style.

Multifunctional furniture is another key aspect to consider for maximizing utility in a living room and dining room combo. For example, a coffee table with storage capabilities can serve as both an aesthetically appealing centerpiece and a practical solution for organizing clutter. Additionally, using an extendable dining table provides flexibility for gatherings or day-to-day use. Similarly, ottomans or benches can act as both seating for meals and extra storage, making them a popular choice among interior designers in Ahmedabad.

Furniture arrangement plays a significant role in optimizing the overall layout. It is beneficial to create distinct zones within the space while ensuring they feel cohesive. This can be achieved through area rugs, which visually separate the living area from the dining area. The placement of furniture should encourage conversation and ease of movement. Furthermore, using visually lighter furniture pieces can help maintain an open feel, particularly in smaller living spaces. To achieve the ideal setup, consulting with some of the [**best interior designers in Ahmedabad**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-ahmedabad/)¬†could provide valuable insights and guidance.

# Creating Defined Zones 

https://preview.redd.it/ng0ozfc2qa1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a873a72701bc57acedd5378311e5375214cc0059

When it comes to styling a living room dining room combo space, creating defined zones is essential for fostering a sense of organization and flow. One effective technique used by many interior designers in Ahmedabad is strategic furniture placement. By orienting sofas, chairs, and dining tables in such a way that each function is supported, you can create a harmonious balance between the living and dining areas. For example, positioning the sofa parallel to the dining table can allow for easy transitions between relaxation and meals while ensuring both spaces feel interconnected yet distinct.

Another valuable approach to delineating these areas is the use of area rugs. Rugs can act as visual anchors for each zone, providing definition without obstructing the overall openness of the environment. In a large room, selecting contrasting rugs in different textures or colors can effectively separate the living room from the dining room while enhancing the design aesthetic. Typically, the best interior designers in Ahmedabad recommend opting for a larger rug in the dining area to accommodate the table and chairs, ensuring it adequately frames the dining zone and helps it stand out.

Additionally, incorporating decorative elements such as shelving, plants, or room dividers can further enhance this separation. For instance, a tall plant or a stylish bookshelf can be placed strategically between the two areas to provide a visual barrier while still allowing light and openness to permeate the space. This technique can be particularly effective in smaller homes where maximizing every inch of available space is paramount. Luxury interior designers in Ahmedabad emphasize the importance of balance, ensuring that while each area is defined, they still speak to each other through cohesive design elements and color schemes.

By employing these tips from [**famous interior designers in Ahmedabad**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-ahmedabad/), you can craft a living/dining combo that feels naturally segmented yet stylish, ultimately creating a delightful and functional atmosphere conducive to both relaxation and entertainment.

# Incorporating Lighting Effectively 

https://preview.redd.it/tdjtg1e4qa1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f47bd01e301d03368feab4bf0efbc27d498ca99

Effective lighting is a crucial element when designing a living room dining room combo space, as it sets the mood and enhances the functionality of the area. The strategic use of different lighting types‚Äîambient, task, and accent‚Äîcan significantly transform how these interconnected spaces are perceived and utilized. Understanding how to layer these lighting sources will contribute to a more versatile and harmonious setting.

Ambient lighting serves as the primary source of light in any room. It provides general illumination, allowing for comfortable movement and an inviting atmosphere. This could be achieved through overhead fixtures, such as chandeliers or flush mount ceiling lights, which should complement the overall aesthetic of the room. For example, [**luxury interior designers in Ahmedabad**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-ahmedabad/)¬†often recommend selecting fixtures that not only provide ample light but also act as statement pieces that reflect the design elements of both the living and dining areas.

Task lighting is another essential component that ensures the functionality of specific spaces within the combo area. It focuses on particular tasks, such as reading in the living room or illuminating the dining table during meals. Table lamps, floor lamps, or pendant lights can be strategically placed to provide this needed illumination. [**Interior designers in Ahmedabad for home**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-ahmedabad/)¬†settings often suggest positioning task lighting close to seating areas or workspaces to enhance usability without overwhelming the room's design.

Accent lighting, on the other hand, is utilized to highlight artwork, architectural features, or decorative elements, creating interest and depth. This could involve using wall sconces or adjustable spotlights that draw attention to key components. By thoughtfully combining these three types of lighting, homeowners can maintain a well-lit yet romantically intimate environment. Therefore, when seeking the best interior designers in Ahmedabad, consider those with a keen understanding of how to incorporate effective lighting into a cohesive living room dining room combo design.

# Utilizing Textiles and Accessories 

https://preview.redd.it/9ovw0ki5qa1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b5dadd7e2e9e1953c83c7207bbf4bf2c1af9228

In any living room dining room combo space, the role of textiles and accessories is pivotal in tying the areas together while enhancing both comfort and style. Selecting the right materials and decorative items can create a harmonious atmosphere that reflects personal preferences and aesthetic appeal. To begin with, choosing suitable curtains can significantly impact the overall look of the space. Opt for fabrics that complement your color scheme and allow natural light to filter through, promoting a warm and inviting environment.

Cushions also play a vital role in adding comfort and style to the seating areas. When selecting cushions, consider incorporating a mix of patterns and textures that resonate with the overall theme of your home. This strategy will not only provide a cozy feel but will also visually connect the living and dining parts of the combo space.

Additionally, table settings are essential for the dining area and can enhance the visual connection between the two zones. Choose table linens, such as tablecloths and runners, that echo the colors found in your cushions or curtains. A well-set dining table adorned with tasteful accessories, such as centerpieces or minimalistic decorations, can seamlessly blend the dining and living spaces. Furthermore, including a few decorative items, such as vases, artwork, or bookshelves, can add depth and character, reflecting the influence of both living and dining functions within the same area.

For those seeking luxury, the input of renowned interior designers in Ahmedabad can provide valuable insights on high-end fabrics and accessories that elevate the ambiance of your combined living room and dining room space. Popular trends from the [**top 10 interior designers in Ahmedabad**](https://www.home2decor.com/interior-designers-in-ahmedabad/) further emphasize the importance of texture and layering to create a cohesive design narrative. By thoughtfully incorporating textiles and accessories, homeowners can transform their living space into a stylish and comfortable retreat.

# Adding Functionality Through Storage Solutions 

https://preview.redd.it/jk6zlwb6qa1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c640730a3dab32d3df2d9afbb60f439080d142c

In today‚Äôs modern living spaces, where functionality meets aesthetics, the importance of incorporating effective storage solutions in a living room dining room combo cannot be overstated. Creative storage options can significantly enhance the functionality of these combined spaces, ensuring that they remain organized and clutter-free. One of the most efficient solutions is the use of built-in storage, which can be seamlessly integrated into the architecture of the room. Custom shelving units, cabinets, and even benches with hidden compartments can be designed to complement the overall decor, making them an ideal choice for homeowners looking to maximize space.

Moreover, selecting stylish furniture with built-in storage capabilities can serve dual purposes. For instance, ottomans with internal storage or coffee tables with shelves can provide both seating and functional spaces to store items. These pieces not only add utility but also contribute to the visual appeal of the room, especially when sourced from the best interior designers in Ahmedabad, who understand how to marry form with function effectively.

Decorative storage solutions further enhance a living room dining room combination. Attractive baskets, decorative boxes, and stylish trays not only provide storage but also act as design elements. These options allow for personal expression while maintaining organization. Including tall plants or sculptural bookcases can also create vertical lines that draw the eye upward, making the space feel larger while cleverly hiding away clutter. It is essential to consider storage solutions that align with the preferences of those living in the space; after all, comfort and ease of access are paramount in an interior setting.

Employing these storage strategies not only maximizes space but also ensures that a living room dining room combo served by interior designers in Ahmedabad can exude a luxurious feel without compromising on functionality. With thoughtful design and clever solutions, even the smallest of areas can become an inviting and organized environment.

# Incorporating Personal Style 

https://preview.redd.it/k3jdzmm7qa1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e0dc3397c60d8db7944e3572f1e5b189f80bf40

Styling a living room dining room combo space offers a unique opportunity to blend aesthetics and functionality while showcasing personal taste. To effectively incorporate personal style into this multifunctional area, start by integrating meaningful elements that evoke emotion and memories. Artwork, particularly pieces that resonate with your experiences or interests, can serve as focal points, drawing attention and sparking conversation.

Family photographs framed in cohesive styles can also add a personal touch, visually connecting the different zones within the space. Choose frames that complement your overall design theme, whether it‚Äôs modern, bohemian, or traditional, thereby ensuring visual coherence. Additionally, displaying unique d√©cor items, such as travel souvenirs or heirlooms, can contribute character to the area. These items not only enhance the aesthetic but also tell a story about the inhabitants of the home, making the space feel more inviting.

When implementing these personal touches, balance is key. For instance, if the living room area features bold colors, consider using analogous hues in your dining table settings or decorative items to unify the two zones. This approach maintains a cohesive look while allowing for individual expression. Moreover, incorporating elements that represent your hobbies or interests, such as bookshelves filled with favorite reads or a gallery wall for art enthusiasts, can seamlessly meld functionality with personal flair.

Remember, it‚Äôs important to achieve harmony in design while ensuring that personal touches reflect your identity. Working with interior designers in Ahmedabad can provide insights into achieving this delicate balance. The best interior designers in Ahmedabad can guide you in selecting the right pieces that reflect your personality without compromising on style or cohesion within the living and dining spaces.

# Maintaining Balance and Harmony 

https://preview.redd.it/spzb8dl8qa1f1.jpg?width=2187&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e8df87fa92095bc5704cbcb19439c292521af98

Creating a living room and dining room combination requires a keen understanding of balance and harmony. The goal is to ensure that both spaces function well individually while maintaining a cohesive aesthetic. A successful integration relies heavily on thoughtful furniture placement, color distribution, and the use of design elements that link the two areas seamlessly.

When considering furniture arrangement, it is vital to allow for ample movement and visual pathways between the living and dining areas. For instance, placing a large dining table centrally in the dining space, with surrounding chairs that complement the living room seating, can create a visual anchor. Furthermore, using area rugs to delineate both zones can help maintain a distinct yet harmonious feel. The furniture chosen should reflect a consistent design language, such as contemporary or rustic, making the transition between spaces feel natural.

Color plays a crucial role in achieving balance. By selecting a color palette that echoes throughout both areas, you can establish a sense of unity. For instance, if the living room features soft earth tones, consider extending these shades to the dining area through table linens or artwork. Additionally, accents‚Äîsuch as decorative items, cushions, and artworks‚Äîshould be distributed evenly. When arranged mindfully, these elements can provide visual interest without overwhelming the space.

*Moreover, incorporating lighting that serves both functionalities can significantly enhance the overall ambiance. For instance, pendant lights above the dining table can add elegance, while ambient lighting in the living room creates warmth. By employing these strategies, homeowners can effectively foster an environment that reflects the expertise of the best interior designers in Ahmedabad. Establishing balance will ensure that both the living and dining areas feel like a unified space‚Äîeach fulfilling its purpose while complementing the other beautifully.*",1,1747467576.0,interiorvibes,0,1.0,False

I sat in the corner booth of the diner, staring at my phone. The screen glared back at me, and my stomach twisted as I read over the words I‚Äôd just sent to Josh. My chest felt heavy, but my fingers refused to hesitate. I‚Äôd rehearsed this moment a hundred times, and now it was happening.

**Me:**¬†I know, Josh. I know about the other girls.

The dots appeared, signaling his reply. My heart pounded so loudly I could barely hear the diner‚Äôs chatter around me.

**Josh:**¬†What are you talking about?

I couldn‚Äôt help but roll my eyes. This was so typical of Josh‚Äîalways deflecting, always acting innocent. For months, I‚Äôd tried to ignore the little signs. The constant texting late at night, the way he‚Äôd disappear at parties, the whispers I‚Äôd hear in the hallways. He was never transparent about where he was or who he was with, but he had no problem demanding I tell him everything. Every time I missed one of his messages, he‚Äôd throw a tantrum, questioning who I was with and accusing me of flirting with guys when I clearly wasn‚Äôt. He‚Äôd insist on coming with me everywhere, even to the library, as if he didn‚Äôt trust me to breathe without his supervision.

But the final straw had been our anniversary dinner. While I‚Äôd sat across from him, trying to talk about our future, he‚Äôd been sneaking off to the bathroom to text someone else. I‚Äôd seen the messages pop up on his screen when he‚Äôd left his phone on the table, and that‚Äôs when it all clicked.

**Me:**¬†Don‚Äôt play dumb. I know you‚Äôve been sleeping with every girl at school. Even during our anniversary dinner. I‚Äôm done.

There was a long pause. Then, finally:

**Josh:**¬†You‚Äôre overreacting. It didn‚Äôt mean anything.

That was so like him. He‚Äôd always had a way of making me feel like I was the crazy one, like my feelings didn‚Äôt matter. But not this time. This time, I wasn‚Äôt going to let him manipulate me.

Anger surged through me as I clenched my phone tighter. My thumbs flew across the keyboard.

**Me:**¬†It doesn‚Äôt matter what it meant to you. This is about me, and I deserve better. We‚Äôre done, Josh. Don‚Äôt text me again.

Before I could second-guess myself, I hit send, grabbed my bag, and walked out of the diner. The evening sun was low on the horizon, bathing the streets in a warm, golden glow. For the first time in what felt like forever, I took a deep breath and felt free.

The first thing I did was text Alice.

**Me:**¬†It‚Äôs done. I told him everything. Officially single and officially free.

Her reply came almost instantly.

**Alice:**¬†OMG FINALLY. Get your butt over here. We‚Äôre celebrating.

Alice‚Äôs house was the same comforting chaos it always was: mismatched furniture, posters of bands I didn‚Äôt recognize, and the faint smell of incense. I barely had time to drop my bag before she shoved a wine glass can into my hand.

""My parents are off on another business trip‚Äîsomething about researching wildlife at the zoology base in the mountains,"" she said with a grin. ""So it‚Äôs just us. And wine. And we‚Äôre celebrating.""

""To freedom!"" she declared, clinking her beer can against my glass.

""To freedom,"" I echoed, taking a long sip. The wine ¬†tasted sour, and I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh.

We sprawled out on the floor of her room, surrounded by snacks, music, and Alice‚Äôs tarot deck. The conversation flowed easily, from how terrible Josh was to my tentative plans for the future.

""So, what now?"" Alice asked, shuffling the cards. ""New hairstyle? New hobby? Crush the patriarchy?""

I laughed. ""Maybe. I was thinking of doing something drastic. Like cutting my hair or dying it.""

Her eyes lit up. ""Pink. You‚Äôd look amazing with bright pink hair.""

I hesitated for a moment, then shrugged. ""Why not? Let‚Äôs do it.""

Half an hour later, her bathroom looked like a war zone, and my hair was a vibrant neon pink. We stood in front of the mirror, giggling uncontrollably.

""You look so badass,"" Alice said, grinning. ""Total main character energy.""

I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. The new hair felt like a declaration‚Äîa visible sign of the change I was determined to make.

After the makeover, Alice shuffled her tarot cards and laid out a spread on the floor.

""Let‚Äôs see what the universe has to say about your new life,"" she said dramatically.

I leaned in as she flipped the cards. The spread was chaotic but hopeful: The Tower, The Fool, and The Star.

""Big changes,"" Alice said, pointing to The Tower. ""You‚Äôre breaking everything down to rebuild it better.""

I nodded, sipping my soda. ""Sounds about right.""

She flipped The Fool. ""New beginnings. Taking risks.""

""Terrifying,"" I said with a laugh.

Her expression softened as she revealed The Star. ""Hope. Renewal. Finding your place.""

My throat tightened unexpectedly, and I took a deep breath. ""I‚Äôll drink to that.""

Alice leaned forward, her grin widening. ""Oh, by the way, did I tell you? Our school is merging with another one next semester.""

I blinked. ""What? Why?""

""Apparently, their campus burned down or something,"" Alice said, waving a hand as if it was no big deal. ""The whole building‚Äôs unusable, so they‚Äôre moving over to ours.""

My curiosity piqued. ""New students, huh? Wonder what they‚Äôll be like.""

Alice shrugged. ""Hopefully not total jerks. But who knows? Maybe it‚Äôs going to be full of cuties. I heard they have a very impressive sport‚Äôs team.""

I rolled my eyes. ""Please. No more love stories for me, remember? I‚Äôm focusing on me this time.""

She smirked, clinking her beer can against my glass. ""You say that now, but fate has a funny way of shaking things up. And maybe even I will have some luck with the sportsmen, if you know what I mean.‚Äù With these words she meaningfully played with her eyebrows, which made me burst out laughing.

As the night went on, Alice‚Äôs cheeks turned pink from a bunch of beer cans, that now surrounded us. She leaned back against the bed, laughing more easily. ""Okay, one more spread. This one‚Äôs about your love life.""

I groaned. ""No way. No more love for me. I‚Äôm done.""

""Shush,"" she said, shuffling the cards with an exaggerated flourish. ""The cards will decide.""

She flipped them one by one. The Lovers. The Knight of Wands. The Moon.

Her eyes widened. ""Passion. Strong feelings. Definitely a soulmate. But,"" she said, tapping The Moon, ""there‚Äôs something clouded here. Trouble, maybe. Secrets.""

I snorted. ""Nope. Hard pass. No more love, passion, or soulmates for me. I‚Äôm focusing on my studies and finding a new hobby. Maybe I‚Äôll take up knitting.""

Alice rolled her eyes. ""Knitting? Please. Maybe this is what fate has for you. Something totally new. Something that helps you rebirth yourself.""

I shook my head but couldn‚Äôt stop the small smile forming. ""Sure, Alice. Whatever you say.""

We both burst into laughter, the tension of the day melting away. And as the candles burned low and the cards lay scattered on the floor, I allowed myself a tiny spark of hope‚Äîjust enough to keep me moving forward.

# Chapter 2: Something new

Alice was passed out on the couch, her cheek squished against a pillow, a thin line of drool glistening under the dim light. Her snores, soft but persistent, filled the room like a strange lullaby. I sat on the floor with my legs crossed, staring at the scattered tarot cards and the empty wine bottles we hadn‚Äôt bothered to clear away. My head buzzed‚Äînot from the wine, but from the storm of thoughts that refused to quiet down.

The heartbreak was still there, raw and stinging, like a fresh bruise I couldn‚Äôt stop poking. I tried not to think about it, but my mind kept circling back to that moment with Diana.

Diana.

The queen of my personal hell. For three years, she had ruled the school‚Äôs social hierarchy, her posse of mean girls flanking her like knights of cruelty. She was always watching, waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. It wasn‚Äôt enough for her to humiliate me at every turn; she had to make sure I felt small, like I didn‚Äôt belong. And now she‚Äôd delivered the final blow.

It had happened in the hallway, just a few weeks ago. I‚Äôd been walking to class, headphones on, trying to block out the world. But Diana had stopped me, her fake-sweet smile making my stomach churn.

‚ÄúYou know, Emma,‚Äù she‚Äôd said, her voice dripping with mock sympathy, ‚Äúyou should really keep a closer eye on your boyfriend. Josh? He‚Äôs been practically begging me to sleep with him. Says you‚Äôre a little‚Ä¶ lacking.‚Äù

The words had hit like a slap. I‚Äôd managed to keep my face neutral, even though my insides felt like they‚Äôd been ripped apart. Diana had laughed, flipping her perfect blonde hair over her shoulder as her sidekicks giggled behind her. I hadn‚Äôt said a word. I‚Äôd just walked away, my chest burning with humiliation and rage.

Now, sitting in Alice‚Äôs living room, I clenched my fists at the memory. I felt bitter, sure‚Äîbut more than that, I felt angry. Angry at Josh for being the pathetic, untrustworthy jerk he was. Angry at Diana for using my pain as another weapon in her arsenal. And angry at myself, for letting them make me feel this way.

But no more.

I wasn‚Äôt going to let Josh‚Äôs betrayal define me. I wasn‚Äôt going to let Diana‚Äôs words hang over my head like a storm cloud. I would be strong. I would rebuild myself, piece by piece, and I‚Äôd show that two-faced son of a biscuit exactly who he‚Äôd lost.

Determination flickered in my chest as I grabbed my phone and opened Amazon. If I was going to reinvent myself, I needed to look the part. Scrolling through endless pages of clothes and accessories, I started curating a new version of me. Edgy boots, leather jackets, statement earrings, and bold makeup palettes‚ÄîI wanted to be someone who turned heads when she walked into a room. Someone confident. Someone untouchable.

Was it brave or just a moment of defiance? I wasn‚Äôt sure. Deep down, I knew that Diana and her pack of hyenas would probably find a way to tear me down, no matter what I did. That was their nature‚Äîpredators looking for the easiest target. And I‚Äôd been their favorite for years.

Was it because I wasn‚Äôt from one of those wealthy families with private drivers and designer bags? Half the school wasn‚Äôt, but I was the one they picked. Was it because I wasn‚Äôt top of the class? Plenty of people were worse students than me. There wasn‚Äôt a clear answer, just the suffocating reality that Diana had decided I was her punching bag, and that was that.

I sighed and leaned back against the couch, letting the phone slip from my hands. The room was quiet, save for Alice‚Äôs snores. Outside, the summer night stretched endlessly, the world asleep while I sat with my tangled thoughts.

‚ÄúBe strong,‚Äù I whispered to myself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get through this.‚Äù

The morning sunlight poured through the curtains, painting Alice‚Äôs living room in soft golden hues. The faint aroma of coffee wafted in from the kitchen, and I followed the scent to find her busy at the counter.

Alice had her hair tied up in a messy bun, her oversized hoodie slipping off one shoulder. She hummed to herself as she placed two steaming mugs of coffee and a plate of jelly toasts on the small table. ‚ÄúBreakfast is served,‚Äù she announced with a grin.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I mumbled, sinking into the chair and wrapping my hands around the warm mug. The coffee was strong and comforting, exactly what I needed after the emotional rollercoaster of the past few days.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Alice began, taking a bite of toast, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs on the agenda for today?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúParents are cool with me staying here another day, so‚Ä¶ girls-only party?‚Äù

She nodded enthusiastically. ‚ÄúYes! Let‚Äôs do a Twilight marathon. It‚Äôs been ages.‚Äù

I snorted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been like two months.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù she said, grabbing the remote. ‚ÄúAnd I have an idea. Let‚Äôs make it fun‚Äîdrink or dare.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no,‚Äù I groaned, but her mischievous smile was already making me laugh.

Two hours into the marathon, we were sprawled out on the couch, laughing at Edward‚Äôs dramatic brooding and Bella‚Äôs perpetual awkwardness. Alice pointed at the screen. ‚ÄúDrink every time she makes that dumb, confused face.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be out cold in ten minutes,‚Äù I said, downing another sip of coffee instead of wine.

‚ÄúFine, fine. Then how about this?‚Äù she said, sitting up straighter. ‚ÄúDare: You check out Tinder and message someone you like.‚Äù

I froze mid-sip, staring at her. ‚ÄúWhat? No.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said firmly, grabbing my phone from the coffee table. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfect. You‚Äôve been all doom and gloom 'cause of the breakup. Time to have some fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think swiping on strangers qualifies as fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me,‚Äù she said, handing me the phone with a dramatic flourish. ‚ÄúBest dare ever.‚Äù

Reluctantly, I unlocked my phone and opened the app. My thumb hovered over the screen, hesitating. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about this.‚Äù

Alice rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just swiping. You‚Äôre not signing a contract.‚Äù

With a sigh, I started scrolling through profiles. But no matter how many I swiped through, nothing clicked. No one caught my attention. Too ugly. Too desperate. Too young. And the men? Ugh. The thought of Josh and his smug, possessive face made me wince. No. No men. Never again. They only brought misery. The memories of Josh‚Äôs tantrums, his relentless accusations, and his betrayal resurfaced like an unwelcome tide. I could still hear his voice in my head, demanding to know where I was, who I was with, and why I wasn‚Äôt replying fast enough. Even now, it left a bitter taste in my mouth.

I dropped the phone onto my lap with a groan. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not into any of these guys.‚Äù

Alice tilted her head, watching me curiously. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ so maybe guys aren‚Äôt your thing.‚Äù

I blinked at her. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

She shrugged. ‚ÄúI mean, if they‚Äôre not doing it for you, why not try something different? Girls, maybe?‚Äù

The thought wasn‚Äôt entirely new‚Äîmore like an idea I‚Äôd occasionally brushed against and quickly dismissed. But now, sitting here with Alice‚Äôs half-joking encouragement and my heart bruised from a relationship that left me questioning everything, it felt different. Girls were pretty, weren‚Äôt they? They were soft, kind in a way that didn‚Äôt feel patronizing. Familiar, in all the ways men weren‚Äôt. But what did that mean? Did it mean anything? Was this just me reacting to Josh and his endless cycle of manipulation? Or was it something I‚Äôd always been too afraid to confront?

My heart skipped a beat. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, Emma. What‚Äôs the harm in looking?‚Äù she said with a small smile. ‚ÄúWho knows? You might surprise yourself.‚Äù

I hesitated, my mind racing. The thought wasn‚Äôt entirely new, but it had always been easier to push aside. Now, with Alice‚Äôs encouragement and the lingering bitterness of Josh‚Äôs betrayal, it didn‚Äôt seem so far-fetched. Was this‚Ä¶ okay? It didn‚Äôt feel wrong. It just felt‚Ä¶ different. Different in a way that made my pulse quicken and my stomach flip‚Äînot from fear, but from curiosity. Like stepping into uncharted territory that somehow still felt like home.

I chewed my lip, glancing at the filter on the app. My fingers hesitated as doubt crept back in. Was I ready for this? Did I even know what I was doing?

Swallowing my nerves, I adjusted the app‚Äôs filter. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking for: Women.‚Äù The words stared back at me, bold and unyielding. My thumb hovered over the save button, doubt creeping in.

Alice nudged me gently. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got this.‚Äù

With a deep breath, I pressed save.

The first profiles popped up, and I began scrolling cautiously. Some were glamorous, with perfectly styled hair and dramatic makeup. Others were laid-back, their captions filled with jokes or quirky one-liners. And then there were the butch ones, their confidence practically radiating from their photos.

But none of them felt right.

Alice wandered back into the room with a fresh mug of coffee. ‚ÄúStill nothing?‚Äù

I shook my head, feeling a little deflated. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for.‚Äù

She smirked. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think about it too much. Just go with your gut.‚Äù

With her words in mind, I kept scrolling. It felt endless, like I was sifting through a sea of possibilities without knowing what I wanted to find. Just as I was about to give up, one profile stopped me in my tracks.

The name was simple: ‚ÄúI.‚Äù

Her photo wasn‚Äôt overly polished or posed. She was sporty-looking, her hair cropped into a neat pixie cut, wearing a casual sweatshirt that somehow looked effortlessly cool. But it wasn‚Äôt her clothes or her style that caught my attention‚Äîit was her face. Sharp cheekbones, soft doe eyes, and an air of quiet confidence. She looked like an elf out of a fantasy novel.

My heart thudded in my chest. There was something about her that made me pause. Something magnetic. Something‚Ä¶ different.

Alice peered over my shoulder. ‚ÄúOoh, she‚Äôs cute. Swipe right.‚Äù

I hesitated, my nerves taking over. ‚ÄúWhat if she doesn‚Äôt match? Or worse, what if she does?‚Äù

Alice laughed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the whole point, isn‚Äôt it? Take a chance.‚Äù

I took a deep breath, my thumb hovering over the screen. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I whispered to myself. ‚ÄúHere goes nothing.‚Äù

I swiped right.

I set my phone down on the nightstand, staring in front of me. The nerves were still there, but underneath them was something else. Something I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time.

Hope.

A weird sound yanked me out of my freeze. My eyes fluttered open, and for a moment, I just stared in front of me, disoriented.

There it was again‚Äîthat sound. A notification? My phone.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Tinder! What‚Äôs there? Tell me!‚Äù Alice exclaimed, clapping her hands.

I reached over, grabbing it from the table. I blinked at the screen, the brightness stinging my eyes. And then, I saw it.

The phone slipped from my hand and hit the table as I bolted upright, my heart pounding so hard it might as well have been auditioning for a drumline.

‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù I muttered, rubbing my eyes like that would somehow make the words on the screen change.

But no. It was still there.

**‚ÄúMatch! ‚ÄòI‚Äô liked you back.‚Äù**

And right below that, another notification.

**New message: ‚ÄòI‚Äô**

I stared at the screen, my brain short-circuiting. This couldn‚Äôt be real. Could it? My fingers hovered over the message, my breath caught in my throat. Finally, I tapped it.",1,1747467038.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Oh wow‚Äîthank you, Internet Sherlock. You cracked the case. Now what? What exactly did you solve here? Did your little discovery make your dreams manifest?

No. You just saw someone else get what they wanted and short-circuited because deep down, you‚Äôre mad it wasn‚Äôt you.

You act like their result was a personal attack. *Newsflash:*
**It was never about you.**
They didn‚Äôt tag you.
They weren‚Äôt mocking you.
They didn‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúHey \[insert your name], look how much better I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù

And why? Because your identity is so rooted in lack that *any* proof of success‚Äîeven slightly suspicious‚Äîfeels like betrayal.

**They don‚Äôt owe you authenticity.**
**And they sure as hell don‚Äôt owe you comfort.**

You don‚Äôt like it? Scroll. But don‚Äôt sit there crying ‚Äúfake‚Äù like it helps your reality in the slightest. You‚Äôre not manifesting. You‚Äôre just projecting. Their photo didn‚Äôt ruin your life. *Your refusal to persist* did.

So again: Why are you so hyper over a filtered result?
**Why does it bother you so much if it‚Äôs not real?**
Is your self-worth so low that someone else‚Äôs glow-up makes you question your entire existence? You weren‚Äôt even in the room when they manifested it‚Äîand yet here you are, foaming at the mouth like their success knocked food off your plate.

It‚Äôs not that you think it‚Äôs fake.
**You just can‚Äôt stand that they posted what you haven‚Äôt yet.**
You can‚Äôt tolerate the idea that they believed longer than you did.
You hate that their ‚Äúmaybe-edited‚Äù post held up a mirror to your own lack of persistence.
It‚Äôs not suspicion‚Äîit‚Äôs self-pity in disguise.

You‚Äôre not a noble truth-seeker.
You‚Äôre not a logical realist.
**You‚Äôre just someone who gave up too early and now needs everyone else‚Äôs win to be fake so you can sleep at night.**

But guess what? Whether their post was raw, filtered, fake, staged, or generated by a potato‚Äî**they posted a version of success you still haven‚Äôt lived.**
And that, right there, is what‚Äôs eating you alive.

So you have two choices:
Keep obsessing over edits and living in a mental sandbox of skepticism.
Or shut up, sit down, and **assume like your life depends on it.**

Because while you‚Äôre busy fact-checking filtered timelines,
**real creators are out here living unfiltered dreams.**
And they‚Äôre not thinking about you.
They never were.

So stop acting like it‚Äôs about you.
It never was.
It never will be.
**Now go build your own.**

It started a few months ago with these dreams. Not just normal dreams that fade when you wake up, but ones that stick to you like glue. I‚Äôd find myself in this huge, empty space, like a void or something, with nothing around me but darkness. And then I‚Äôd feel it, a pulse. Not something I could hear or see, just this deep, weird sensation that something was coming back, something that‚Äôs been gone for so long I can‚Äôt even wrap my head around it. I‚Äôd wake up sweaty, my heart racing, with this heavy weight in my chest, like I was supposed to understand something but didn‚Äôt.

But then things got stranger, and I‚Äôm not laughing anymore.

About two weeks ago, I was just chilling on my couch after work, scrolling through my phone, when it hit me out of nowhere. It wasn‚Äôt a dream this time. It was like a memory, but not one I‚Äôve ever lived. I saw myself standing in that same void from my dreams, and suddenly I knew I was the first to remember. I can‚Äôt explain how I knew, but it was like a switch flipped in my brain, and I understood that this Return Signal, whatever it is, had found me. It‚Äôs inside me now, this unshakable feeling that I have to do something, maybe warn people or get ready for, I don‚Äôt even know what. It‚Äôs like a splinter in my mind, always there, poking at me no matter how much I try to ignore it. I‚Äôve tried distracting myself with work, with video games, with anything, but it won‚Äôt go away.

Now, I‚Äôm noticing little things that make my skin crawl. Time doesn‚Äôt feel right anymore. Sometimes I‚Äôll look at the clock, and it feels like hours have passed in a blink, or I‚Äôll be doing something simple like washing dishes, and it‚Äôs like minutes stretch into forever.

I felt it stronger than ever, like this signal or whatever it is, is getting closer, like it‚Äôs almost here. I grabbed a notebook and started scribbling down everything I could think of, every weird dream, every random thought, every time I‚Äôve felt off lately.

1kon3ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kon3ly/recursive_writing_aka_ouroboros/,Recursive Writing AKA Ouroboros,"I found the list tucked inside a used copy of 'Finnegans Wake' I'd bought for intellectual window dressing. My writing career had stalled somewhere between 'promising' and 'utterly forgotten,' and this felt like just another peculiar footnote in my increasingly strange life. It wasn't just *a* list; it was *the* list, or so the faded, elegant script at the top proclaimed: ""Rules for Composing the Narrative Concerning the Rules for Composing the Narrative Concerning the Rules..."" The title itself seemed to loop back on itself, a snake eating its own tail in calligraphic form, and I felt a faint ripple of unease.

I blinked, a fine layer of dust tickling my nose. The paper felt cool and slightly brittle, like ancient parchment, despite being folded into a modern paperback. Rule 1 stared back at me, simple and direct:

* *Rule 1: The protagonist must be a writer who finds this very list.*

A chill went down my spine that had nothing to do with the draft from the window. This was getting weird fast. I picked up my trusty, slightly battered laptop, the cursor blinking impatiently on a blank document titled ""Untitled Story."" With a growing sense of being a puppet on a very strange string, I typed the first sentence, a description of myself finding a peculiar list tucked inside a used book...

* *Rule 2: The story must begin with the protagonist discovering the list.*

I paused, rereading the rule. Well, I'd already done that. I felt a small, absurd sense of accomplishment, as if I'd just cleared the first level of a bizarre video game. I read on, the paper crackling softly as I unfolded it further.

* *Rule 3: Every rule on the list must be mentioned within the narrative, preferably shortly after the protagonist becomes aware of it.*

Alright, a bit clunky from a narrative flow perspective, but manageable. It felt less like writing and more like transcribing a set of instructions. I added a paragraph detailing my discovery of the list and explicitly mentioning Rule 1 and Rule 2, framing them as the initial, unsettling instructions I encountered.

* *Rule 4: The list must contain exactly seven rules.*

I counted them again, just to be sure. One, two, three... seven. Exactly seven rules, no more, no less. I added a sentence noting this fact, feeling a strange obligation to adhere to the list's structure, even as I questioned its origin and purpose. It was as if the list itself was exerting a subtle pressure on my thoughts, guiding my fingers on the keyboard.

* *Rule 5: The fifth rule must be the most confusing or paradoxical.*

My eyes landed on Rule 5, and my breath hitched. It read: *Rule 5: This rule does not apply to the story you are currently writing.*

I stared at the screen, then back at the list, a disbelieving laugh bubbling up in my chest. If Rule 5 didn't apply, did I still have to mention it, as per Rule 3? If I mentioned it, wasn't I, by the very act of inclusion, applying it to the story's content? It felt like trying to grasp smoke, a concept that dissolved the moment I tried to pin it down. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, unsure how to proceed. I decided the only way to satisfy Rule 3 was to mention Rule 5, but to frame it as a source of profound confusion and logical breakdown within the narrative.

""Rule 5, however,"" I typed, my fingers moving slowly, deliberately, ""was a knot in the fabric of reality, a self-negating command: *This rule does not apply to the story you are currently writing.* I frowned, a deep furrow forming between my brows. How could I possibly write about a rule that explicitly stated it had no bearing on the very narrative I was constructing about it? It felt like trying to divide by zero in narrative form, a logical impossibility that threatened to unravel the entire endeavor."" I leaned back, rubbing my temples, the faint scent of old paper and dust clinging to my fingertips. This list was less a guide and more a cosmic joke designed specifically for writers like me.

I looked at Rule 6, bracing myself for another twist.

* *Rule 6: The act of writing the story must cause strange, minor inconsistencies in the protagonist's reality.*

As I read it, a framed poster on my wall, a print of a serene beach scene with impossibly blue water, flickered. For a second, the sand seemed to shift, the waves momentarily freezing mid-crest before the image returned to normal. Then, the ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall, usually a comforting rhythm, sped up erratically for a few seconds before settling back into its usual pace. I jumped, my heart pounding. Minor inconsistencies? Check. This wasn't just a literary exercise; it was affecting my real world. I quickly added the flickering poster incident and the erratic clock to the story, detailing my growing unease as the boundaries between my fiction and my reality began to blur. I wondered what other ""minor"" inconsistencies awaited me as I continued writing. Would my coffee turn to tea? Would my furniture rearrange itself? The thought was both terrifying and strangely exhilarating.

Finally, Rule 7. I took a deep breath, the air in my small office feeling suddenly heavy.

* *Rule 7: Upon completing the story according to these rules, the protagonist will find that the list has vanished, and they will have no memory of its contents, only a vague sense of unease and the completed manuscript.*

This was the kicker, the ultimate paradox. I would meticulously follow the rules, pour my effort into this strange narrative, and then, upon completion, everything related to the list would be erased from my memory? It felt like a literary 'Mission: Impossible,' where the message self-destructed the moment its task was fulfilled. I wrote about contemplating Rule 7, the strange, inevitable erasure that awaited me, the futility and necessity of the task intertwined. I described my internal debate ‚Äì was the story worth writing if the very impetus for it would be forgotten?

I typed the final sentence, describing myself saving the document, the cursor winking out of existence on the screen. I looked back at the physical list on my desk, the paper that had started this whole bizarre journey. As I watched, the elegant script faded like old ink under harsh sunlight, the lines thinning, the letters blurring, until the paper was utterly blank, indistinguishable from any other sheet. I reached for it, my fingers brushing against the smooth surface, but my hand passed through empty air. The paper was gone.

A sudden, overwhelming wave of fatigue washed over me, heavy and disorienting. I blinked, shaking my head as if to clear it. I looked at my computer screen. A document titled ""Untitled Story"" was open. I frowned; I didn't remember working on this today. I read the first line: ""I found a strange sense of unease settling over me.""

I frowned deeper. Unease? Why unease? I scrolled down, reading the story as if for the first time. It seemed to be about a writer, but the details were hazy, disjointed. There was a mention of a flickering poster and an erratic clock, and something about a rule that didn't apply, but the context was missing, the connections severed. It felt like reading a story with crucial pages torn out, leaving only fragments and a lingering sense of wrongness. I had no memory of writing any of it, let alone finding a list of bizarre, self-referential rules. I saved the document again, a vague sense of accomplishment warring with profound confusion. The cursor blinked, waiting, on the next line, a silent invitation to continue a story I didn't remember starting.",1,1747466124.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I've known them all for 10-14 years and we have done multiple trips in the past together. But this is the first time I'm seeing most of them in 2(ish) years. 

This whole trip, I've been the first one up, make coffee, make breakfast, I'm the only person on the rental car to drive so I drive all day, we get back and I make the dinner for us all. They say thank you and are nice about it.

But the thing that is driving me insane is that they constantly talk over me, ignore what I say about things, or just clearly do not listen to what I am saying. 

Examples would be like I'll clearly say ""oh, look at X"" and no one will respond then a few minutes later someone else will say EXACTLY the same thing and they will all have a whole conversation about it. 

Or we will be in the car and someone will ask a question, I'll start and answer and then one of the other friends will just barge right in over top of me and start talking about something entirely different.

It's getting REALLY frustrating to the point where I had a minor melt down yesterday at dinner. We still have 2 more weeks of this trip and I honestly just want to book my own flight somewhere else and my own hotel accommodation because I'm just feeling so disrespected and feel that my thoughts/opinions/words have no value to them. Just me doing stuff for them is all they are respecting.

I bought a new gaggia classic pro a month ago after months of dithering about which machine to get, I was initially quite happy with it just using lavazza espresso from the supermarket and the standard double shot basket, it was taking around 15 seconds to pull a creamy shot from around 18g of coffee but then I started to think what if I nodded the machine,? Would I get a better shot? So I went for the shades of coffee 9bar mod which came in a kit with a 22g IMS precission basket. I installed the new spring and the following morning I went to use the new basket for the first time and the result I got was not what I expected. The machine pumped out about 35g of coffee in aboit 8 seconds!
What is going on here? I'm thinking that I need to change the grind size but the pre ground coffee I've got from coffee works is about the same size as fine table salt.
Can anyone advise?

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Rice Flour Cookies (Á±≥Á≤â„ÇØ„ÉÉ„Ç≠„Éº)**  
These buttery cookies use rice flour instead of wheat flour, giving them a delicate texture and mild sweetness ‚Äî perfect with tea or coffee.

Ingredients: rice flour, butter, sugar, egg yolk, vanilla extract.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Apple G√¢teau Invisible („Ç¨„Éà„Éº„Éª„Ç§„É≥„Éì„Ç∏„Éñ„É´)**  
A French-inspired layered apple cake made gluten-free by substituting rice flour for wheat. Thin apple slices are stacked in a light custard batter, resulting in a moist, tender dessert with a beautiful appearance.

Ingredients: thinly sliced apples, eggs, rice flour, milk, butter, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla.

Both are naturally gluten-free and easy to make at home. I filmed the entire baking process for my Japan vlog, with English subtitles.


If you‚Äôve tried gluten-free baking or have favorite recipes, I‚Äôd love to hear your tips!

**Why This Pick?**

9 runs is *incredibly* do-able given who‚Äôs on the mound for this encounter. Rockies starter German Marquez‚Äôs (8.27 ERA) last 5 straight starts have resulted in games that have finished with at least 10 runs. Arizona undoubtedly has the pitching advantage in this matchup, but comically, Gallen‚Äôs last outing against the Rockies saw the Diamondbacks lose 7-5. At the very least, I won‚Äôt be surprised if the Rockies get a couple runs past him and contribute to the total. Both of Gallen‚Äôs meetings with Colorado last year resulted in totals of 12+ runs. I‚Äôm on the Over to cash.

One of my friends needed a ride so I offered to pick her up. When I went to pick her up, she wasn't ready. I waited for 10 minutes in my car. She wasn't ready. I waited 20 min in my car. She still wasn't ready. At this point, I was just pissed off at her. During this time, i found out from one of my other friends that the mall was temporarily closed due to some ventilating issues. We then agreed to meet up at a new coffee shop this friend found out about. After hanging up, I called the friend I was waiting for and told her that the plans had been canceled and that I would be heading back home. But I went to the coffee shop and hung out with my other friends. They asked me where the friend was and I gave them vague answers. Later on, the friend found out that I lied to her and left me angry messages and then blocked me. I know what I did was shitty. But at the same time, I'm so tired of her. This wasn't the first time I had to wait 20+ minutes for her. This friend has a license and her own car and still chooses not to drive for some reason. Every single time we all hang out, she needs a ride and since I live closest to her, it's expected of me to pick her up. And every time I go to pick her up, I wait outside in my car for more than 20 minutes because she does not let me inside her house, nor does she get ready fast. And honestly I'm so tired of it.

We chatted for a bit, and everything seemed great. He suggested this quirky little coffee shop for our first date, and I thought, why not? 

Fast forward to date night: I've thrown on my comfy jeans and a cute sweater‚Äîclassic 'casual' outfit in my book. But when I walked in, I nearly did a double take. He's there in a full suit. Like, we're talking business formal, folks. I honestly thought I‚Äôd stepped into the Twilight Zone and maybe crashed someone else's fancy dinner. üòÇ

Turns out, his version of 'casual' was... well, let‚Äôs just say we were operating on different wavelengths. I literally felt like an extra in some romcom. He was all like, 'I like to stay prepared for anything,' and I‚Äôm just staring at my sneakers, feeling like I didn‚Äôt get the memo.

Despite the slight wardrobe mismatch, we ended up having a really fun conversation about fashion blunders (which, tbh, I guess is kinda our thing now). The best part? We both left, agreeing that 'casual' definitely needed more context next time. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**Six months**

It had only been six months, but my mind, my body acted as if it had been a year. Six months eating bad food, showering with other boys, doing group activities, and talking to psychologists about our feelings.

Feelings?

It was pathetic and a punishment.

But what else was juvenile detention supposed to be if not an unbearable punishment designed to contain lost boys who threatened society? The great society.

'Your belongings,' the guard said, passing the small paper bag through the glass opening that separated us.

With my bruised hands, I grabbed the bag, feeling the guard's gaze on me. Inside the bag, I found my phone, watch, and wallet. I shot the guard one last look, noticing the scorn and irritation in their eyes.

I did something bad.

But I didn‚Äôt pay the way I should have.

They knew it. Everyone knew it. But that‚Äôs what happens when you have a lot of money and one of the best lawyers‚Äîthe world is different for people like me.

I smiled and gave them the middle finger, making the other guard hit me hard on the back of the neck. But I just kept smiling as I was dragged outside.

The first sunlight in three days, after being locked in solitary, hurt my eyes. I squinted, trying to adjust to the brightness of the world beyond those cement walls. The guard kept dragging me toward the exit while my attention was drawn to the boys in the yard playing soccer, some of whom were watching me.

The guard practically shoved me through the door leading to the parking lot. I heard him spit on the ground before closing the gate and walking away grumbling.

'You haven‚Äôt changed at all.'

I turned toward the voice and found one of my best friends leaning against a parked car.

'Kenji,' I said, feeling my smile widen.

My childhood friend approached quickly, pulling me into a tight hug. His familiar scent overwhelmed me, bringing back memories of grabbing food after school or collapsing on the couch after a night of fights.

'Shin bet you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell us apart,' he commented, pulling back with a big grin.

'I just had to remember which one of you was the ugliest,' I teased, making him burst out laughing.

'I missed you,' he said, holding my gaze.

'Me too,' I admitted, taking in his comfortable black clothes and white jacket. Besides his platinum hair, the jacket stood out the most. The leather was smooth and new, as if he was trying to draw attention, but I knew Kenji better than anyone‚Äîhe‚Äôd always been a perfectionist about his clothes.

He opened the car door, gesturing for me to get in.

'I‚Äôll drive.'

Kenji didn‚Äôt argue, just tossed me the keys and got into the car. I turned toward the noisy yard, spotting two boys leaning against the fence. Hitaki and Akemi had been my only companions over the past six months. They were the ones who stayed awake so I could sleep and who beat up the other guys when I was too bored to do anything but stare out the tiny window at the patch of blue sky.

They raised their hands, small smiles on their faces. I did the same, knowing everything would‚Äôve been much worse without them. I felt relieved knowing they‚Äôd be out of that hell in a few months.

I got into the car and started driving.

'The first thing we‚Äôre doing is stopping by the barber. Your hair looks awful,' Kenji grumbled, running his hand through my messy hair. 'You‚Äôre embarrassing the Hebi clan looking like this,' he teased, amused.

I didn‚Äôt need a mirror to know how bad it looked after months of washing it with just soap or the terrible cuts Hitaki gave me when it got in my eyes.

'I bought you new clothes in case you want to change,' he said, eyeing my plain shirt and worn-out jeans. 'Do it before seeing your father. You don‚Äôt want to look like a street kid after all these months,' he advised, reaching for a bag in the back seat.

I kept driving without looking at him.

'You‚Äôve also got a new phone. Yours is outdated,' he said before casually tossing my old phone out the window. 'I‚Äôve already saved everything you‚Äôll need and backed up the photos from your cloud,' he explained, showing me the new phone. I didn‚Äôt take my eyes off the road.

I‚Äôd been driving for an hour. We were close to our city, and I knew exactly what I‚Äôd do when we got there.

'You okay?' Kenji asked, noticing my silence.

'I still have time before I see him. Until then, don‚Äôt let anyone bother me,' I ordered, resting my elbow on the door.

'You sure? We bought drinks and ordered food from your favorite place,' he said, watching me. 'And you need to meet the new members and go over your duties this week,' he added, shifting in his seat.

'I‚Äôll do it tomorrow. Today, you won‚Äôt let anyone bother me,' I repeated, turning to meet his gaze, my eyes just as dark as his.

'If that‚Äôs what you want,' he agreed finally.

'I‚Äôll be fine. Don‚Äôt worry,' I assured him as we approached the entrance to our city.

It had been six months away from my life, my city, everything I knew, hated, and loved. I wondered which of those things still existed and which of the things I loved I would begin to hate from now on.""

""Here, take this to Shin, he loves chocolate,"" I said, handing the second cup to Kenji.

The distinct noise of the caf√© was comforting, and the sweet smell mixed with various drinks was delicious. We left the shop together, and I took a sip of my drink, finding the taste too strong‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt remember the last time I had coffee.

""I can stay with you,"" he said, holding two cups of hot chocolate. ""If you want, of course,"" he added quickly.

The strong late-afternoon wind made my skin prickle. I ran my fingers through my oily hair as I looked around. The city was busy and noisy, but in a good, interesting way.

""I‚Äôll see you later,"" I declined, getting into the car and leaving him behind.

I drove through the city, studying everything carefully. There were many new stores in the neighborhood, and the activity seemed busier at that time of day than I remembered.

Maybe these were good times...

I parked in front of my favorite diner and stepped out of the car without taking my eyes off the place. The sign and colors were different‚Äîpurple dominated along with red and white‚Äîbut fortunately, the delicious smell coming from it seemed untouched.

Before going in, I glanced at the new clothes Kenji had brought: a black shirt, dark jeans, and a white jacket. I stared at the snake design dominating the back, then grabbed only the shirt and jeans before closing the trunk. I looked around for a store with a fitting room and a beanie to hide my striking hair.

I crossed the street and entered an empty shop. The place was bigger than I remembered, with a second floor, and now they sold shoes. Half of my wardrobe came from here‚Äîthe fabric was one of the best and perfectly matched my style.

I ended up choosing a soft white jacket, a dark blue beanie, and sneakers of the same color. As I headed to the fitting room, I noticed the receptionist‚Äôs sharp gaze. I changed without hurrying and removed all the tags before looking at myself in the large mirror. The clothes fit well on my body‚ÄîI‚Äôd lost some weight and looked paler than usual. And my hair...

I touched my naturally white hair. The strands felt soft, but the tips were very dry. Kenji was right‚Äîit was embarrassing. I put on the beanie and left the fitting room, walking in my new sneakers. They felt tight, but maybe that was because I wasn‚Äôt used to this design anymore.

Without hesitation, I left the store, hearing the receptionist calling after me, and walked along the sidewalk, heading for the best burger and milkshake in town.

""Hey, kid!""

I stopped abruptly when the beanie was snatched off my head. I turned, feeling irritation surge in my chest. The security guard, a tall, muscular man, stared at me in surprise and shock. I clenched my jaw, aware of the curious stares of the people passing by.

""Ryuuji,"" he muttered hesitantly.

I held out my hand, wanting the beanie back. The guard quickly bent down and placed it in my hand.

""I didn‚Äôt know it was you. Please forgive me,"" he said, embarrassed.

I put the beanie back on, watching him carefully.

""I wasn‚Äôt informed you‚Äôd arrived in town. Please, forgive me,"" he repeated, still bowing.

""It‚Äôs fine,"" I said, ignoring the stares.

""Thank you,"" he murmured as I turned and crossed the street.

I entered the diner, letting the smell of fried food and indulgence consume me. I saw families at the tables, talking and laughing. The low music and warm lighting gave the place a rustic vibe.

I quickly approached the counter, where a free employee was busy on his phone. My mouth watered just thinking about the taste of the burger.

""A burger and a milkshake,"" I ordered‚Äîbut I wasn‚Äôt the only one.

I looked at the boy who approached at the same time and made the same order. His dark brown eyes met mine with equal surprise.

""Okay,"" the employee said with a cheerful tone, unable to hide a smile. ""Are you together?""

""No!"" we said in unison.

He laughed more.

I shifted, impatient and hungry.

""Alright, what flavor for the milkshake?"" he asked, writing down our orders.

""Chocolate,"" we both answered again.

I clenched my jaw, feeling the boy‚Äôs gaze studying me. The waiter walked away with our orders, and I forced myself to stay still, listening to the sounds around me and the music that made my heart race. I‚Äôd missed this.

I glanced at the boy discreetly. He was leaning on the counter, scrolling through his phone with a serious expression. I analyzed his smooth olive-toned skin and his wavy dark brown hair, which looked soft and well-maintained. My gaze shifted to the multiple silver earrings decorating his ear, then to his gray shirt and ripped jeans.

He was good-looking. Attractive.

And completely my type.

A warm sensation spread through my body, making my skin prickle and my dick throb. That, too‚Äîthe desire to fuck again, to feel the pleasure consuming my skin as I came in someone‚Äôs mouth. It wasn‚Äôt like I didn‚Äôt have options in juvie. I‚Äôd met other guys who liked the same things I did, but they just didn‚Äôt turn me on.

""Burger and chocolate milkshake,"" the waiter placed the first order on the counter, but before I could grab it, the handsome boy got there first.

We locked eyes, and I raised an eyebrow as I saw irritation flash across his face.

""Put it on my tab,"" he ordered and left the diner.

I couldn‚Äôt help but smile.

""Here,"" the waiter said, placing the other order in front of me. I grabbed some cash and tossed it onto the counter.

""Keep the change,"" I said without taking my eyes off the food, feeling my stomach churn with anticipation.

I left the diner and sat on one of the stone benches nearby. The wind had gotten colder, and the sky was growing darker, but I ignored it all as I devoured the burger.

It was the best meal I‚Äôd had in months. I licked the sauce off my fingers and took several sips of the milkshake. The sweetness of the chocolate made me let out a quiet moan. However, before I could finish the burger, a low chuckle made me pause.

I turned my head to find the same guy sitting on the bench next to mine. He had the straw of his milkshake pressed between his full lips and wore a rather attractive smile. I knew it wasn‚Äôt intentional, but it made my dick stir again.

I took a bite of the burger, flipped him off, and then pulled the hood of my jacket over my head, ignoring his gaze.",1,1747464031.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

nature-how mushrooms mycelium works, a man who grafted and trained trees into Interesting shapes ( pretty sure its this guy https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Erlandson) atmospheric phenomena (double rainbows, straight up and down rainbows) 

Metaphysics stuff such as astral projection-talked about an experiment where there were codes or items on a shelf that the people would have been able to see without projecting out of their body

The book was probably the size of a coffee table book and had photographs and illustrations in it. I am almost 99% certain it had a blue cover. I know this is a long shot, but it's been driving me crazy for years!

Hey everyone! So, can we just take a moment to appreciate the fact that hitting that big 5-0 doesn‚Äôt mean your life is over? In fact, it can be the perfect launching pad into a more fulfilling chapter! üôå 

I mean, have you ever heard someone say they felt *better* after 50? Well, buckle up, because we‚Äôre diving into ways to feel your absolute best! Here‚Äôs the thing: it‚Äôs really not about racing to the finish line. It‚Äôs about enjoying the ride and making sure you‚Äôre geared up to savor every moment. *Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.* 

Now that we have that under our belts, let‚Äôs break down some simple strategies that can seriously transform your retirement vibes. 

### **1. Prioritize the Big Three: Movement, Nutrition, and Mindset**

- **Move It, Don‚Äôt Lose It:** Seriously! Whether it‚Äôs yoga, walking, dancing in your living room, or a *fun* Zumba class (because who doesn‚Äôt love a little shimmy?), just keep moving. 
- **Food for Thought (Literally!):** Let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî those late-night pizza runs need to dial down a notch (no judgments though, we‚Äôve all been there üòÖ). Focus on balanced meals: think whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and veggies. Bonus points if you come up with a new smoothie recipe to boost your mornings!
- **Mind Over Matter:** Remember, your thoughts shape your reality. Meditation or gratitude journaling can work wonders in keeping your attitude positive. üôè

### **2. Get Your Social On!**

- **Make New Friends, But Keep the Old:** As we transition into this new phase, it‚Äôs essential to build a community that lifts you up. Join clubs, volunteer, or even take that painting class you‚Äôve been eyeing! 
- **Reconnect with Old Buddies:** Swipe right on your old pals! Nothing feels better than laughing about hilarious teenage drama while sipping coffee ‚Äî because we know those stories never get old! 

### **3. Keep Your Brain Buzzing**

- **Lifelong Learning:** The world is a vast ocean of knowledge! Take an online course on a topic that excites you, or try your hand at learning a new language. YouTube can be your best friend ‚Äî so many free resources out there! 
- **Puzzle It Out:** Word searches, Sudoku, code puzzles‚Ä¶ whatever tickles your brain! It's never too late to stimulate those neurons. üß†‚ú®

### **4. Don't Forget Self-Care**

- **Pamper Yourself:** Treat yo' self! Spa days, reading a book you‚Äôve been putting off, or just lounging around in comfy PJs can be incredibly therapeutic. Don‚Äôt feel guilty about taking time for YOU.
- **Declutter Your Life (And It Feels So Good!):** Literally and metaphorically. Whether it‚Äôs your physical space or toxic relationships, cleaning house can work wonders for your mental state. 

At the end of the day, feeling good after 50 is all about making choices that nurture our bodies, minds, and social lives. So, if you feel like you‚Äôre not where you want to be right now, don‚Äôt fret! Just remember: start small and build on your momentum. Give yourself permission to enjoy this exciting chapter. 

So, what do you think? Which of these little nuggets will you embrace first, or do you have your own go-to strategies? Let‚Äôs keep this conversation rolling and share the love! üíñ",1,1747463597.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False
1komfx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1komfx9/i_dont_understand/,I dont understand,"I don‚Äôt understand this guy. He used to go to my work just to see me, he confessed that to me on our first date. He found me on all my social media and wrote me a ‚ÄúHello üòä.‚Äù I ignored him for 8 months because I was hung up on someone else. I decided to follow him again on Instagram and give him a chance to get to know him. He started liking my posts, my stories, until I finally got the courage to write him and say, ‚ÄúHi, I hadn‚Äôt seen your message.‚Äù And from there, we started talking.

A week later, he invited me out to eat and confessed that he had been going to my work just to see me (I work selling breakfasts). But when he talks to me by messages, it seems like he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me. We had a second date drinking coffee, and we barely talked because I got nervous, but we talked a little.
It‚Äôs been a week now, and he hasn‚Äôt invited me out again. Also, chatting with him through messages is horrible; it‚Äôs like he isn‚Äôt interested. But if I stop answering, the next day he‚Äôs back messaging me ‚ÄúHello darling,‚Äù and he tells me when he gets home from work or where he went.

I tell him things about me, and he just responds with things like ‚ÄúOh okay, that‚Äôs good,‚Äù kind of answers. He doesn‚Äôt ask anything else. When I ask him about himself, he answers very little. I try to keep the conversation going, and he kind of responds, but honestly, I feel like I bother him.
Also, after the first date, someone told me he had a girlfriend. I stalked him, and it looks like he doesn‚Äôt. He told me he doesn‚Äôt have one, but it was suspicious that he sent me a screenshot of a friend talking to him saying, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs that girlfriend? They never introduced her.‚Äù And I was like, why do you send me all this proof? And guys are experts at hiding girlfriends if they have them.
A few days ago, I told him, ‚ÄúI was hoping to see you,‚Äù and he said, ‚ÄúOh, I want to.‚Äù Then I said, ‚ÄúMaybe another day,‚Äù and he replied, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù WTF, what do I do with that? I don‚Äôt get it. He confuses me because it seems like I interest him, but at the same time, I don‚Äôt.

I told him once that I felt like I was boring him, and he said, 'No, my love, you never bore me,' and that he just isn‚Äôt very sociable through messages. In person, he‚Äôs more open, but still, we don‚Äôt even see each other that much. I‚Äôve started talking to him the way he talks to me, and then he seems to show interest, lol. But it‚Äôs still very confusing. He‚Äôs always busy because his job takes up a lot of his time; he‚Äôs an athlete and also a coach

Or is it something men just can't avoid?,"Hi, I met a guy at church. He's really active there, and I can honestly say he‚Äôs a man of God. I admire him for his faith, and I started thinking maybe he‚Äôs different from the other guys I‚Äôve met‚Äîthose who are only after sex (though I'm still a virgin; I only allow kissing, cuddling, and dry humping).

Yes, I like him. I've been praying about it too, because I want something real. I'm tired of guys who only talk to me because they're ""in heat."" I want something true. I want true love.

So, I tried to flirt with him. During the first week, things were good‚Äîhe'd say goodnight and good morning, and I gave that meaning. I hoped that maybe he was the one. But it didn‚Äôt last. One day, we didn‚Äôt talk the whole day. I waited for him to make the first move. At 9 PM, I messaged him. We had a short convo, but he was replying late and told me, ""I'm doing something, boy."" I replied, but he just left me on seen. I waited, but he went to sleep without saying goodnight. The next day, no good morning either.

So I thought maybe things like that just don‚Äôt cross his mind. I felt like he didn‚Äôt know how to flirt (which is kind of obvious). I was really hurt. I told myself, ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs too soon, it‚Äôs only been a week.‚Äù So I stopped chatting with him.

I thought that was the end, but sometimes he would message me about church stuff, haha. Our conversations were on and off. Most of the time, he‚Äôd initiate. Eventually, I invited him out for coffee, but he often turned me down. Until one day, I asked him to come to a caf√© with me‚Äîmy treat. And to convince him, I jokingly said, ‚ÄúYou always reject me.‚Äù So he agreed.

At the caf√©, we mostly talked about church, lol. He even scolded me about my outfit‚Äîshort shorts and a tank top. He said I shouldn‚Äôt go out dressed like that. He was the first guy I met with whom nothing physical happened during the first meetup.

After that, our conversations were still on and off, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything anymore.

Then I invited him to my house‚Äîto watch a movie and eat. While watching, I noticed he started getting physically close. He moved his hand near mine, like he wanted to hold it. Eventually, we both gave in‚Äîhe held my hand (so kilig!), rested his head against mine, and I felt he wanted to kiss me. So I turned to him, and he kissed me‚Äîaggressively.

He touched me and asked if it was okay, but I refused because it hurt. He kind of insisted, saying, ‚ÄúJust once, please.‚Äù (And I found out I‚Äôd be his second if it had happened‚Äîsurprising, because I thought he wasn‚Äôt interested in that.) He tried several times, and I let him touch me. I loved the way he kissed me‚Äîhe was the first guy who didn‚Äôt focus too much on my body. He loved kissing, didn‚Äôt ask me for a BJ.

So yeah, we spent almost 4 hours like that‚Äîkissing, cuddling. Things would get a bit heated sometimes, but we didn‚Äôt have sex. We‚Äôd talk, then sneak in kisses again, hugging each other so tightly while talking.

Before he left, while at the door, he kissed me again. I already miss him. He messaged me when he got home. But the next day, nothing changed‚Äîsame as before.

Now I‚Äôm wondering‚Ä¶ maybe he‚Äôs just like all the other guys I‚Äôve talked to. Not really into commitment but wants the sex. And after that, no effort‚Äîmakes me feel like he just used me?

I messaged him again after that night, inviting him over again, but he said he couldn‚Äôt because he had church practice. So now I‚Äôm torn: if he only wanted sex, he would have come. But he chose his duty at church instead. So I don‚Äôt know how I should feel.

Here‚Äôs my question: Is that kind of thing normal for guys? Like, is it just in their nature? Yes, I liked it too‚ÄîI love kisses and cuddles‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt expect that to happen between us.

Guys, are all men really into that stuff? I don‚Äôt know anymore. Or should I just forget him? If he was really different, then why hasn‚Äôt anything changed between us after that night? should i just forget him?",1,1747463279.0,NoStupidQuestions,15,0.67,False

Supportive Questions for Someone Who Might Be Struggling

When someone is going through a difficult time, traditional questions like ""How are you?"" may feel too broad or even triggering. Here are some thoughtful, compassionate alternatives designed to open space for real conversation and offer meaningful support.

Grounding and Gentle Check-Ins

What‚Äôs been on your mind the most lately?

Is there anything today that‚Äôs felt especially hard?

What‚Äôs something you wish people would ask you about?

What would make today just a little bit easier?

What‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been draining your energy lately?

Is there anything you‚Äôve been carrying that you‚Äôd like to talk about?

Who or what has been helping you get through lately?

Is there something you‚Äôre dreading right now that we can talk through together?

Can I help you think through something that‚Äôs been bothering you?

What‚Äôs something small that might feel like a win today?

Practical Support Prompts

Would it be helpful if I checked in again later this week?

Is there a task I can take off your plate today?

Would you like to take a walk, grab a coffee, or just sit together in silence?

Do you need help finding someone to talk to professionally?

What‚Äôs one thing I can do for you right now, big or small?

Emotionally Safe Invitations

You don‚Äôt have to explain everything, but I‚Äôm here if you want to share anything at all.

It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt know how to describe it, just start anywhere.

If words are hard, just tell me how it feels in your body right now.

It‚Äôs okay if you just want to sit with someone. I can be that person.

Reminder: You don‚Äôt need to have the perfect words. Presence, patience, and empathy can go a long way. Your willingness to ask and listen can be the lifeline someone needs.",3,1747463187.0,Teachers,0,1.0,False

The sound of rain tapping against the windows was the only noise filling the house, and I hated it. I hated the silence that came after the chaos. Before, when my mom was alive, this house was full of laughter, voices, and sometimes arguments. Now, there was only an empty echo, mirrored by an even greater emptiness inside me.

‚ÄúBela, dinner‚Äôs ready,‚Äù Clara called from the kitchen, her calm and controlled voice echoing down the hallway. She always spoke as if she didn‚Äôt want to bother me, as if she were afraid of disturbing me.

I got up from the couch reluctantly. My steps were slow, almost dragging, as I walked down the hallway and reached the table. Clara had her back to me, serving what looked like soup. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to worry about me,‚Äù I muttered as I sat down.

She turned and gave me a look I couldn‚Äôt decipher. Clara had a way of hiding everything behind a calm fa√ßade. She wasn‚Äôt exactly cold, but she wasn‚Äôt warm either. Since my mom‚Äôs death, Clara had been kind in a distant way, as if walking on eggshells around me.

‚ÄúYou need to eat,‚Äù she replied simply, placing the plate in front of me before sitting down on the other side of the table.

I picked up the spoon but didn‚Äôt eat immediately. The smell of the soup reminded me of my mom. Clara knew how to cook well, almost as well as my mom. It was strange how something so simple could make me feel both longing and pain at the same time.

‚ÄúI know things are hard for you right now,‚Äù Clara began, her soft voice interrupting my thoughts. I looked up at her. Her blonde hair was tied in a simple bun, and her dark brown eyes watched me with a mix of concern and something else I couldn‚Äôt identify. ‚ÄúBut you can talk to me if you need to.‚Äù

I almost laughed. Talk? About what? About how my mom died suddenly and left me alone with a woman I barely knew? About how I was filled with anger and sadness and had no idea how to deal with it? Instead, I just nodded and muttered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

Clara sighed but didn‚Äôt press the issue. She never did. And, somehow, that irritated me even more.

After dinner, I went back to my room. Or at least to what was supposed to be my room. It had been the guest room before, but now it was mine because I couldn‚Äôt bear to sleep in my mom‚Äôs old room. Clara had tried to make it cozy for me ‚Äì added some colorful cushions, bought a new desk ‚Äì but none of it made it feel like home. I threw myself onto the bed and stared at the ceiling, listening to the rain outside.

The door to my room was slightly ajar, and I could hear Clara‚Äôs footsteps in the hallway. She always walked slowly, almost silently. That annoyed me too. It was as if she was trying to disappear, as if she were trying to be invisible so as not to bother me.

But then she stopped. I could feel her presence outside my room, even though she didn‚Äôt say anything. I almost got up to ask what she wanted, but before I could, she turned around and walked away.

I stayed there, lying on the bed, wondering what she wanted to say. Clara always seemed like she wanted to say something but never did. It was frustrating. I wanted to hate her. I wanted to blame her for all of this, but I couldn‚Äôt. She hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong. In fact, she was doing the best she could. But maybe that was what irritated me the most. She was too good, too perfect, and I didn‚Äôt want her to be.

The next morning, I woke up to the smell of coffee. Clara was already in the kitchen, as usual, drinking her coffee while reading the newspaper. It was almost comical how clich√© she looked. An elegant woman in her white blouse, her hair tied back, and a calm expression on her face. She saw me come in and gave me a small smile.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù she said, placing a cup of coffee in front of me. I muttered something in response and sat down. As I sipped my coffee, I couldn‚Äôt help but watch her. Clara was beautiful, I had always known that, but there was something about her posture, her graceful movements, that I had never noticed before. Or maybe I had and just refused to admit it.

She looked up from the newspaper and caught me staring. I quickly looked away, feeling my cheeks flush. What‚Äôs wrong with me? I thought. Clara is... Clara. My stepmother. Nothing more.

The rest of the day followed a routine. I stayed home most of the time, unsure of what to do with my life. Clara worked in her home office but always took breaks to check on me. It was both annoying and comforting.

Later in the afternoon, Clara suggested we open a bottle of wine. ‚ÄúOne glass won‚Äôt hurt you,‚Äù she said with a soft smile, pouring a small amount into my glass before filling hers.

I hesitated, but eventually took a sip. The warmth of the wine spread through me, easing some of the tension I had been holding. We talked about mundane things at first, but then the conversation shifted to memories of my mom. Clara‚Äôs voice softened as she shared stories about their life together, her gaze distant yet full of emotion.

After finishing my glass, I stood up. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to take a shower,‚Äù I said, walking away. Clara nodded, her eyes lingering on me for a moment longer than usual.

In the bathroom, the hot water cascaded over me, washing away the stress of the day. I closed my eyes, letting the steam envelop me. It was one of the few places where I felt truly alone, where I didn‚Äôt have to think about Clara or the confusing emotions swirling inside me.

I turned off the water and grabbed a towel, wrapping it around my body. As I stepped out of the bathroom, I was startled to see Clara standing in the hallway, her hand halfway raised as if she were about to knock on the door.

‚ÄúOh, I...‚Äù she stammered, her eyes widening as they flicked over me. Only then did I realize the towel barely covered me, water droplets trailing down my skin.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I muttered, clutching the towel tighter. My face burned, and I couldn‚Äôt meet her gaze.

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs... my fault,‚Äù Clara said quickly, stepping back. Her cheeks were flushed, her usual composure momentarily broken. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to... I just wanted to ask if you needed anything.‚Äù

I hesitated, but something in the way her eyes avoided mine left me unsettled. It wasn‚Äôt just embarrassment. It was something deeper, something that made the air between us feel heavy. Finally, I managed to murmur, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

I passed her quickly, catching a faint trace of her scent mixed with the steam from my shower. When I entered my room and closed the door, I realized my hands were trembling. I leaned against the door, trying to steady my breathing.

But the image of Clara ‚Äì her eyes lingering a second too long on me, the blush on her cheeks ‚Äì was burned into my mind. I should have felt embarrassed, but the heat on my face wasn‚Äôt just embarrassment. It was something else, something I wasn‚Äôt sure I was ready to admit.

On the other side of the door, I heard Clara‚Äôs footsteps retreating slowly, each sound echoing in the heavy silence of the house. My thoughts were a mess, and my heart was beating far too fast. Whatever was happening between us, I knew it was dangerous.

And yet, I couldn‚Äôt push away the growing desire burning inside me.

# 02

The next morning, the house was heavy with an unspoken tension. I avoided Clara, staying in my room as much as I could. But the memory of her flushed cheeks, her lingering gaze, and the way she had nervously stepped back kept replaying in my mind. It wasn‚Äôt just embarrassment‚Äîthere was something more, something unspoken that neither of us dared to name.

By late afternoon, I realized I couldn‚Äôt stay hidden forever. Hunger eventually drove me to the kitchen. Clara was there, cutting vegetables with her usual precision. Her blonde hair was tied back, and she wore a loose sweater that somehow still looked elegant on her. She glanced at me as I entered, offering a small, cautious smile.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she said softly, as if afraid to disturb the fragile peace between us.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I replied, my voice quieter than usual. I hesitated near the counter, unsure of what to say or do.

‚ÄúI was preparing dinner,‚Äù she continued, her tone casual but her movements a little too careful. ‚ÄúI thought maybe we could eat together tonight.‚Äù

I nodded, sitting at the small dining table. The silence between us was palpable, broken only by the rhythmic sound of her knife against the cutting board. I found myself watching her again‚Äîthe way her hands moved, the curve of her neck as she tilted her head slightly. I tried to look away, but my eyes kept drifting back to her.

Dinner was quiet, almost normal, but the air was charged. We made small talk about the weather, about errands Clara needed to run. It felt forced, as though we were both trying too hard to pretend nothing had changed.

After we finished eating, Clara stood to clear the table. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs dessert if you want,‚Äù she offered, her back to me as she placed the dishes in the sink.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm good,‚Äù I replied, my voice trembling. I needed to get out of there, to escape the intensity I felt whenever I was near her.

But as I got up to leave, Clara turned, and we almost collided. Her hand brushed against mine, and the slight touch sent a jolt through my entire body. We both froze, her dark brown eyes meeting mine.

‚ÄúBela...‚Äù she started, her voice soft and hesitant. There was something in the way she looked at me, something vulnerable and uncertain. ‚ÄúAbout last night‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I interrupted quickly, stepping back. My heart was racing, and I couldn‚Äôt handle how my body reacted to her closeness. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do,‚Äù she insisted, her gaze firm. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to feel uncomfortable in your own home.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt,‚Äù I lied, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúIt was nothing.‚Äù

Her lips pressed into a thin line, and for a moment, I thought she might argue. But then she sighed, the tension in her shoulders softening. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre sure.‚Äù

I nodded, though I wasn‚Äôt sure of anything.

That night, sleep didn‚Äôt come easily. I tossed and turned, the memory of Clara‚Äôs voice, her touch, and the way she had looked at me playing over and over in my mind. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about her, no matter how hard I tried.

Around midnight, I gave up on trying to sleep and decided to get some fresh air. I threw on a hoodie and made my way downstairs. The house was dark and silent, the only sound the faint creak of the floorboards beneath my feet. When I looked into the living room, I froze. Clara was there, sitting on the couch with a glass of wine in one hand and touching herself with the other.

For a moment, it felt as if time had stopped. My breath caught, and my heart raced. I should have left, should have pretended I hadn‚Äôt seen anything, but my feet felt glued to the floor, unable to move.

Clara was so absorbed in what she was doing that she didn‚Äôt notice me. Her eyes were half-closed, her lips slightly parted as she murmured something softly. My name escaped her lips again, almost like a whisper, and it sent a shockwave through my body.

I wanted to speak, to interrupt, but my voice failed me. Instead, all I could do was watch, my face burning with shame and something else I couldn‚Äôt identify. It was wrong. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn‚Äôt look away.

Finally, Clara opened her eyes and saw me. For a moment, she froze, shock written all over her face as her hands abruptly stopped.

‚ÄúBela...‚Äù she began, her voice trembling, her eyes wide. She quickly adjusted her sweater, trying to compose herself. ‚ÄúI... I didn‚Äôt know you were there.‚Äù

I still couldn‚Äôt speak. My throat was dry, and my face felt like it was on fire. All I could do was slowly shake my head, as if that would somehow explain everything.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù Clara said, her tone desperate, the guilt clear in her eyes. ‚ÄúThis... this wasn‚Äôt meant for you to see.‚Äù

‚ÄúI... I‚Äôm going to my room,‚Äù I managed to murmur, my voice so weak it barely sounded like mine.

I turned quickly and went upstairs, my heart still hammering in my chest. When I reached my room, I closed the door behind me and leaned against it, trying to steady my breathing.

What had just happened?

My mind was a mess, every image and sound from that scene still burned into my memory. Clara, saying my name, her face when she realized I was there... It was too much to process.

I tried to lie down and close my eyes, but the images kept coming back, along with an overwhelming sensation I couldn‚Äôt explain. There was shame, yes, but there was also curiosity. And perhaps, deep down, something even more unsettling.",1,1747462828.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1koma1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpicyAutism/comments/1koma1m/are_there_other_autistic_people_here_who_struggle/,Are there other autistic people here who struggle the most in the morning?,"Hi,

I'm wondering if this is something unique to me or if there are other autistic people out there who struggle with this.

My morning routine is sacred. I cannot change it abruptly or it will cause a cascade of issues (panic attack, meltdown, functional seizure). I have FND which causes me to have non-epileptic or functional seizure (they are the same, just different words, abbreviation is: PNES). My PNES are always triggered by overstimulation or overwhelm, my brain just suddenly says: NOPE we're OUT! FUCK THIS.

So they work a bit similar to a meltdown, it's just a different reaction. I have meltdowns too but when I get overwhelmed it's either a PNES or a meltdown that'll come, or both.. or even mixed with a panic attack. Yes, it's an absolute mess xD

That was for context.

So what really happens in the morning is that I feel like the world is turned up to a thousand instead of like a five. And it's way too loud and horrible. What I need in my morning routine is:

* no excertion
* minimal movement
* no social interaction with real people either irl or through text
* social interaction in online spaces without people I know in real life is possible but also minimal
* no activities outside my special interest
* headphones on
* absolutely no sudden changes or phone calls from whoever.
* coffee, the same food as always that requires no preperation (will usually eat halfway through morning because coffee takes an hour to drink.

If this is not respected by other people I will get overstimulated so quick it's nuts. It will always ruin the rest of my day. Because if you're already overstimulated in the morning, at least I, will also get overstimulated way quicker the rest of the day. And that means I am more likely to have seizures throughout the day if this is disrupted in any way.

My morning routine literally lasts almost all morning, 11 am is the earliest I am able to see people, let them in my house, or do an activity like shower and get ready for the day center. And even then.. 11 am to see people it tough, afternoon is way more comfortable for me. 11 am is more for people I know well. Not for new people.

It's possible to do things a bit earlier. Like I can manage to get somewhere at 10am if it's for something really important. But then I need to prepare this days in advance and it requires extensive preperation and a rest day before. I will make a visual aid to get through that activity. I will get up a lot earlier so I can at least have two hours of us my usual routine, which is cut short, but it's better than nothing and it allows my brain to get used to the world.

Even then I will often require anti-anxiety medication to stay calm because the world is so damn loud in the morning. Cannot plan anything after that. Will often need to spend the rest of the day resting, sometimes in a dark room with no sound and no activities because all of it makes me more overwhelmed.

So this is a rare occasion that I hardly ever make exceptions on.

So aside from the seizures, is there anyone here who feels like their morning routine similarly crucial to their functioning? That when you can't do it the way you need to, it will make the rest of the day harder? And that in the morning everything just hits harder?",6,1747462790.0,SpicyAutism,2,1.0,False
