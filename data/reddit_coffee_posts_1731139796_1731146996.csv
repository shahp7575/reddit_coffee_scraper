1gn6ybq,https://www.reddit.com/r/STD/comments/1gn6ybq/how_i_treat_gonorrhea_without_antibiotics/,How I treat Gonorrhea without Antibiotics,"A little background: Tested for Gonorrhea after doing a raw, I got Antibiotics prescription for a week.

Just 3 days in, my stomach is rekt, so I stop it. Nevertheless, the gonorrhea symptom stopped, and I got better.

Fast-forward about 5 months later, I got it again. Took the Antibiotics medicine for 2 days, then I stopped it, because my stomach was hurt badly.

Fast-forward about 3 months later, I got it again. This time, I decide to not take Antibiotics at all because the stomach pain is just worse than gonorrhea pain itself.

How I cope with gonorrhea for the first 3 months:  
\- No coffee, alcohol, cig  
\- Drink water a lot, like once every 30mn (This helps reducing the urination pain)  
\- 50% of the diet is fruit (For the first few days, I ate only fruit, mainly for the fact that they are digested fast. Recommend apple and banana)  
\- Put tissues in your underwear to help with the pus, and change every time you pee.   
\- No sex for 1 month, after that once a week should be fine.

By the end of the 3rd months, I have no longer urination pain but still have pus. From that day, I use cig, coffee, and alochol fine, sex is fine. The only problem is the pus, so you have to keep using the tissues.  
  
By around the end of 6th month, one day randomly, the pus is gone completely. And I'm back to normal.

Virtual Reality (VR) headsets have become one of the most exciting and transformative technologies of the 21st century. They have the power to transport us to completely different worlds, where we can experience things that were once limited to our imagination. Whether you‚Äôre battling space invaders in a galactic war, exploring the depths of the ocean, or walking through ancient civilizations, VR headsets allow us to immerse ourselves in experiences like never before. But what is it that makes VR so cool? Why are these devices changing the way we play, work, and live? Let‚Äôs take a closer look at how VR headsets are revolutionizing our world.

# A Whole New World at Your Fingertips

One of the first things that make VR headsets so cool is the sheer scale of their possibilities. When you put on a VR headset, you‚Äôre no longer bound by the constraints of the physical world. You enter a space where gravity, distance, and time can be bent to your will. From exploring outer space to diving underwater, VR opens up worlds that were previously out of reach for most people.

Imagine traveling to ancient Egypt and walking through the Pyramids, or journeying through a dense rainforest filled with vibrant wildlife. In VR, you can touch and interact with these environments in ways that feel incredibly real. The visual fidelity has come a long way, and modern VR headsets boast impressive graphics that make it easy to forget you‚Äôre in a simulated environment. The sense of immersion is so powerful that it can sometimes be hard to tell where the virtual world ends and the real world begins.

# Escaping Reality

Sometimes, life can be stressful. Whether it‚Äôs the pressure of school, work, or just the daily grind, everyone needs an escape now and then. VR headsets offer a form of entertainment that allows you to disconnect from the real world and immerse yourself in something completely different. Whether you're looking for an exciting adventure, a peaceful meditation experience, or just a place to unwind, VR has something for everyone.

Games, in particular, are one of the most popular ways people use VR headsets. Virtual reality gaming takes traditional gaming to an entirely new level. No longer are you just holding a controller or clicking a mouse. Instead, you are the character, moving, fighting, and exploring in a world that feels real. Games like *Beat Saber*, where you slash through blocks to the rhythm of music, or *Half-Life: Alyx*, a gripping first-person shooter, offer experiences that engage your body and mind in ways flat-screen games simply can't.

In fact, VR gaming is so immersive that it‚Äôs easy to lose track of time. A simple thirty-minute gaming session can feel like it‚Äôs flown by in an instant. And it‚Äôs not just for hardcore gamers‚ÄîVR is becoming accessible to all kinds of players, with simpler, casual games that anyone can enjoy.

# The Social Side of VR

Beyond just the thrill of gaming and exploration, VR has unlocked a new way for people to connect with each other. Social VR platforms like *VRChat* and *AltspaceVR* allow you to interact with other people from around the world in virtual spaces. These platforms are much more than just text chats or voice calls. In VR, you can meet your friends face-to-face (virtually, of course) in an immersive environment where you can see each other‚Äôs avatars, hear each other‚Äôs voices, and even engage in shared activities, like playing mini-games or attending virtual concerts.

One of the coolest things about VR social spaces is the creativity they enable. In these virtual environments, you can create anything. Want to hang out in a virtual nightclub or a cozy coffee shop? You can. Want to visit a space station in orbit around a distant planet? You can do that too. The ability to create, customize, and share experiences is one of the biggest draws of VR social platforms, making them a fun and engaging way to connect with people in ways that go beyond traditional online communication.

# The Future of Work and Education

While gaming and entertainment are often the first things people think of when it comes to VR, its potential for work and education is equally exciting. VR headsets are beginning to transform industries by providing immersive training simulations, virtual meetings, and educational experiences.

In fields like medicine, VR is being used to train doctors and surgeons by providing realistic, 3D models of human anatomy that can be explored and studied in detail. Rather than relying on textbooks or flat images, students can now interact with a digital representation of the human body, gaining hands-on experience in a safe, controlled environment. This makes learning more effective and can even save lives by allowing students to practice skills without the pressure of real-world consequences.

In the workplace, VR is helping to revolutionize remote collaboration. Virtual meetings are becoming more lifelike, with colleagues able to meet in virtual offices or conference rooms. This helps eliminate the sense of isolation that can come with remote work while making collaboration more dynamic. VR can also be used for product design and engineering, allowing teams to explore 3D models and test prototypes before they‚Äôre built in the real world.

# Health and Wellbeing

Virtual reality isn‚Äôt just for entertainment or education‚Äîit‚Äôs also making a positive impact on health and wellness. Therapists are using VR to treat a wide range of conditions, including PTSD, anxiety, and phobias, by immersing patients in controlled virtual environments. This form of exposure therapy helps individuals confront their fears in a safe and controlled setting.

Additionally, VR has become a powerful tool for physical therapy and rehabilitation. Patients recovering from injuries or surgeries can use VR exercises to regain strength and mobility in an engaging way. Rather than doing repetitive physical exercises, VR allows patients to perform their rehabilitation in a more interactive and enjoyable environment, making the process feel more like a game than a chore.

# Accessibility and Innovation

What makes VR even cooler is its accessibility. Advances in technology have made VR headsets more affordable, with a variety of options available to suit different budgets and needs. VR is also evolving to be more comfortable and user-friendly. Many headsets now come with adjustable straps, wireless capabilities, and advanced tracking to enhance the user experience. As technology continues to improve, we can expect even more advancements that will make VR more accessible to people of all ages and abilities.

One of the most exciting developments in VR is the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI). As AI becomes more sophisticated, it will allow virtual environments to respond dynamically to a user‚Äôs actions. This means that virtual worlds will become even more responsive, personalized, and immersive. The possibilities are endless, and as the technology advances, we can expect VR to become an even more integral part of our daily lives.

# Conclusion

There‚Äôs no doubt about it‚ÄîVR headsets are cool. They give us the ability to explore new worlds, connect with people across the globe, learn in innovative ways, and even improve our health. As the technology continues to evolve, we‚Äôre bound to see even more incredible uses for VR, from entertainment to education, medicine, and beyond. The future of VR is bright, and it‚Äôs only just getting started. So if you haven‚Äôt yet experienced the magic of virtual reality, now is the time to dive in. With a VR headset, the world is yours to explore, and the possibilities are as limitless as your imagination.

**Why You Should Get a VR Headset: A Journey Into the Future**

Imagine this: You slip on a sleek, lightweight headset, and in an instant, you‚Äôre no longer sitting on your couch or at your desk. Instead, you‚Äôre standing on the edge of a cliff, gazing out over a vast ocean. You can hear the wind rustling through the trees behind you, feel the sun on your skin, and even see the waves crashing below. You turn your head, and suddenly, you‚Äôre in the middle of a bustling city, walking through a crowded street as neon signs flicker above. No, this isn‚Äôt some dream or a movie‚Äîit‚Äôs your new reality. Welcome to the world of Virtual Reality (VR).

Now, you might be thinking, *Why should I get a VR headset?* After all, your current entertainment setup‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs your TV, gaming console, or computer‚Äîalready offers plenty of options for fun and relaxation. But trust me, VR is not just ""another gadget."" It's an entirely new way of experiencing the world, one that transforms entertainment, learning, and even personal growth in ways you‚Äôve never imagined.

Here‚Äôs why you *should* get a VR headset:

# 1. Immersive Entertainment Like Never Before

One of the most obvious reasons to get a VR headset is for entertainment. Whether you're a gamer, movie buff, or just someone who enjoys exploring new content, VR opens up a world of possibilities that traditional media simply can‚Äôt match.

In VR, you‚Äôre not just watching a movie; you're *in* the movie. Picture this: you're inside a sci-fi thriller, surrounded by futuristic cityscapes, dodging laser beams, and solving puzzles in a virtual world. In traditional gaming, you‚Äôre often separated from the action by the screen. But in VR, you‚Äôre *living* it‚Äîevery movement, every sound, every detail is designed to make you feel like you‚Äôre right there. Games like *Beat Saber* (where you slice through glowing blocks to the rhythm of music) or *Half-Life: Alyx* (a first-person shooter that places you in a detailed, immersive world) provide experiences that are *alive* in a way traditional gaming just can't match.

But VR isn‚Äôt just for gaming. You can attend virtual concerts, travel to faraway places, or even watch a 360-degree movie where you can look around and feel like you're part of the scene. Imagine watching a live concert in VR where you can turn around and see the crowd, or explore the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu without leaving your home. The level of immersion VR provides will make you wonder why you‚Äôve been watching movies and playing games on a flat screen all this time.

# 2. Travel the World Without Leaving Your Home

Getting a VR headset is like unlocking the ultimate travel experience. VR allows you to explore places you may never be able to visit in real life‚Äîwhether it's because of budget constraints, time, or physical limitations. Ever dreamed of walking on the surface of Mars? Or diving to the bottom of the ocean, exploring vibrant coral reefs and swimming with exotic sea creatures? With VR, all of this is possible. And it doesn‚Äôt just stop with faraway places‚ÄîVR can also help you visit art galleries, museums, and historical sites in full 3D.

Platforms like *Google Earth VR* let you soar over mountains, fly through cities, or land in remote parts of the world. You can stand at the foot of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, stroll through the streets of Tokyo, or even watch a sunset on a beach in Bali. All you need is your VR headset. For people who can‚Äôt travel easily due to health reasons, or those who simply want to explore the world from the comfort of their couch, VR is a game-changer.

# 3. The Future of Fitness and Health

Surprised? Believe it or not, one of the coolest reasons to get a VR headset is to help you stay fit and healthy. VR isn‚Äôt just about sitting back and relaxing‚Äîit‚Äôs about moving, sweating, and getting your body involved in new ways. VR fitness has exploded in recent years, with games and apps designed to make exercise feel more like a game than a workout.

Games like *Beat Saber* (again, yes, it's that good!) or *Superhot VR* combine intense movement and strategy to create a fun, full-body workout. You'll be dancing, dodging, and slashing through virtual worlds‚Äîall while breaking a sweat. Whether you‚Äôre doing high-intensity workouts, practicing yoga, or even just engaging in playful sports like boxing, VR brings a new level of engagement that will make you forget you're even exercising. You‚Äôll find yourself working up a sweat, not because you're focused on hitting a fitness goal, but because you‚Äôre having fun in a completely immersive environment.

And it's not just about gaming‚ÄîVR is also being used in physical therapy. Doctors and therapists are using VR to help patients recover from injuries by providing virtual exercises that engage both the mind and body. If you‚Äôve ever dreaded a long, repetitive rehab session, VR might be the solution to make it more enjoyable and effective.

# 4. Learn in Ways You Never Could Before

Learning doesn‚Äôt have to be boring. With a VR headset, you can completely change the way you experience education. Imagine taking a history class where you‚Äôre not just reading about ancient Rome in a textbook, but *walking* through it. You could tour the Colosseum, meet ancient Romans, and see the world through their eyes. Or maybe you‚Äôre studying biology‚Äîwell, now you can literally explore the human body from the inside, watching cells divide and interact in real-time.

VR allows you to interact with subjects in a way that is both hands-on and deeply immersive. Medical students can practice surgeries without the risk of harming a patient, architecture students can walk through their designs before breaking ground, and anyone can take virtual field trips to places that would otherwise be out of reach. The way VR breaks down barriers and enhances engagement makes it a tool not just for fun but for serious learning.

# 5. Socialize in New and Creative Ways

Not only is VR transforming how we play and learn, but it‚Äôs also changing how we interact with others. While video calls and text chats have allowed us to connect with people from around the world, VR takes it a step further. In social VR platforms like *VRChat*, *AltspaceVR*, or *Rec Room*, you can meet people from different countries, make new friends, and participate in group activities as if you‚Äôre all in the same physical space.

You‚Äôll create your own digital avatar and engage with others in fully immersive environments, whether that‚Äôs hanging out at a virtual bar, playing games together, or attending a live virtual concert. Social VR makes the online experience feel far less flat and more human, offering a depth of interaction that traditional social media or video calls can't.

# 6. Escape and Relax Like Never Before

Life can be stressful. The constant demands of work, school, and daily responsibilities can leave you feeling drained. But with VR, you can escape all of that, even if it‚Äôs just for a little while. Whether it‚Äôs meditating on a quiet beach, taking a walk in a serene forest, or simply lying back and watching the stars from a mountaintop, VR can transport you to peaceful, calming environments where you can relax, unwind, and reset.

Some VR apps are specifically designed for relaxation and mental health, offering immersive, calming experiences that help with stress, anxiety, and even sleep. VR can become your personal sanctuary‚Äîan easy way to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and find a little peace.

# Conclusion: The Future Is Waiting

The reason you should get a VR headset is simple: it‚Äôs not just a gadget. It‚Äôs a portal to new experiences, an immersive way to explore, learn, play, and relax in ways you‚Äôve never imagined. Whether you‚Äôre gaming, traveling, working, or connecting with others, VR is changing the way we interact with the world.

Don‚Äôt let the future pass you by‚Äîstep into a world where anything is possible. All you need is a VR headset to start your journey.**Why VR Headsets Are Cool: A Journey Into the Future**

One of the coolest things about VR social spaces is the creativity they enable. In these virtual environments, you can create anything. Want to hang out in a virtual nightclub or a cozy coffee shop? You can. Want to visit a space station in orbit around a distant planet? You can do that too. The ability to create, customize, and share experiences is one of the biggest draws of VR social platforms, making them a fun and engaging way to connect with people in ways that go beyond traditional online communication.

# The Future of Work and Education

While gaming and entertainment are often the first things people think of when it comes to VR, its potential for work and education is equally exciting. VR headsets are beginning to transform industries by providing immersive training simulations, virtual meetings, and educational experiences.

In fields like medicine, VR is being used to train doctors and surgeons by providing realistic, 3D models of human anatomy that can be explored and studied in detail. Rather than relying on textbooks or flat images, students can now interact with a digital representation of the human body, gaining hands-on experience in a safe, controlled environment. This makes learning more effective and can even save lives by allowing students to practice skills without the pressure of real-world consequences.

In the workplace, VR is helping to revolutionize remote collaboration. Virtual meetings are becoming more lifelike, with colleagues able to meet in virtual offices or conference rooms. This helps eliminate the sense of isolation that can come with remote work while making collaboration more dynamic. VR can also be used for product design and engineering, allowing teams to explore 3D models and test prototypes before they‚Äôre built in the real world.

# Health and Wellbeing

Virtual reality isn‚Äôt just for entertainment or education‚Äîit‚Äôs also making a positive impact on health and wellness. Therapists are using VR to treat a wide range of conditions, including PTSD, anxiety, and phobias, by immersing patients in controlled virtual environments. This form of exposure therapy helps individuals confront their fears in a safe and controlled setting.

Additionally, VR has become a powerful tool for physical therapy and rehabilitation. Patients recovering from injuries or surgeries can use VR exercises to regain strength and mobility in an engaging way. Rather than doing repetitive physical exercises, VR allows patients to perform their rehabilitation in a more interactive and enjoyable environment, making the process feel more like a game than a chore.

# Accessibility and Innovation

What makes VR even cooler is its accessibility. Advances in technology have made VR headsets more affordable, with a variety of options available to suit different budgets and needs. VR is also evolving to be more comfortable and user-friendly. Many headsets now come with adjustable straps, wireless capabilities, and advanced tracking to enhance the user experience. As technology continues to improve, we can expect even more advancements that will make VR more accessible to people of all ages and abilities.

One of the most exciting developments in VR is the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI). As AI becomes more sophisticated, it will allow virtual environments to respond dynamically to a user‚Äôs actions. This means that virtual worlds will become even more responsive, personalized, and immersive. The possibilities are endless, and as the technology advances, we can expect VR to become an even more integral part of our daily lives.

# Conclusion

There‚Äôs no doubt about it‚ÄîVR headsets are cool. They give us the ability to explore new worlds, connect with people across the globe, learn in innovative ways, and even improve our health. As the technology continues to evolve, we‚Äôre bound to see even more incredible uses for VR, from entertainment to education, medicine, and beyond. The future of VR is bright, and it‚Äôs only just getting started. So if you haven‚Äôt yet experienced the magic of virtual reality, now is the time to dive in.

Virtual Reality (VR) headsets have become one of the most exciting and transformative technologies of the 21st century. They have the power to transport us to completely different worlds, where we can experience things that were once limited to our imagination. Whether you‚Äôre battling space invaders in a galactic war, exploring the depths of the ocean, or walking through ancient civilizations, VR headsets allow us to immerse ourselves in experiences like never before. But what is it that makes VR so cool? Why are these devices changing the way we play, work, and live? Let‚Äôs take a closer look at how VR headsets are revolutionizing our world.

# A Whole New World at Your Fingertips

One of the first things that make VR headsets so cool is the sheer scale of their possibilities. When you put on a VR headset, you‚Äôre no longer bound by the constraints of the physical world. You enter a space where gravity, distance, and time can be bent to your will. From exploring outer space to diving underwater, VR opens up worlds that were previously out of reach for most people.

Imagine traveling to ancient Egypt and walking through the Pyramids, or journeying through a dense rainforest filled with vibrant wildlife. In VR, you can touch and interact with these environments in ways that feel incredibly real. The visual fidelity has come a long way, and modern VR headsets boast impressive graphics that make it easy to forget you‚Äôre in a simulated environment. The sense of immersion is so powerful that it can sometimes be hard to tell where the virtual world ends and the real world begins.

# Escaping Reality

Sometimes, life can be stressful. Whether it‚Äôs the pressure of school, work, or just the daily grind, everyone needs an escape now and then. VR headsets offer a form of entertainment that allows you to disconnect from the real world and immerse yourself in something completely different. Whether you're looking for an exciting adventure, a peaceful meditation experience, or just a place to unwind, VR has something for everyone.

Games, in particular, are one of the most popular ways people use VR headsets. Virtual reality gaming takes traditional gaming to an entirely new level. No longer are you just holding a controller or clicking a mouse. Instead, you are the character, moving, fighting, and exploring in a world that feels real. Games like *Beat Saber*, where you slash through blocks to the rhythm of music, or *Half-Life: Alyx*, a gripping first-person shooter, offer experiences that engage your body and mind in ways flat-screen games simply can't.

In fact, VR gaming is so immersive that it‚Äôs easy to lose track of time. A simple thirty-minute gaming session can feel like it‚Äôs flown by in an instant. And it‚Äôs not just for hardcore gamers‚ÄîVR is becoming accessible to all kinds of players, with simpler, casual games that anyone can enjoy.

# The Social Side of VR

Beyond just the thrill of gaming and exploration, VR has unlocked a new way for people to connect with each other.

**Why You Should Get a VR Headset: A Journey Into the Future**

Imagine this: You slip on a sleek, lightweight headset, and in an instant, you‚Äôre no longer sitting on your couch or at your desk. Instead, you‚Äôre standing on the edge of a cliff, gazing out over a vast ocean. You can hear the wind rustling through the trees behind you, feel the sun on your skin, and even see the waves crashing below. You turn your head, and suddenly, you‚Äôre in the middle of a bustling city, walking through a crowded street as neon signs flicker above. No, this isn‚Äôt some dream or a movie‚Äîit‚Äôs your new reality. Welcome to the world of Virtual Reality (VR).

Now, you might be thinking, *Why should I get a VR headset?* After all, your current entertainment setup‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs your TV, gaming console, or computer‚Äîalready offers plenty of options for fun and relaxation. But trust me, VR is not just ""another gadget."" It's an entirely new way of experiencing the world, one that transforms entertainment, learning, and even personal growth in ways you‚Äôve never imagined.

Here‚Äôs why you *should* get a VR headset:

# 1. Immersive Entertainment Like Never Before

One of the most obvious reasons to get a VR headset is for entertainment. Whether you're a gamer, movie buff, or just someone who enjoys exploring new content, VR opens up a world of possibilities that traditional media simply can‚Äôt match.

In VR, you‚Äôre not just watching a movie; you're *in* the movie. Picture this: you're inside a sci-fi thriller, surrounded by futuristic cityscapes, dodging laser beams, and solving puzzles in a virtual world. In traditional gaming, you‚Äôre often separated from the action by the screen. But in VR, you‚Äôre *living* it‚Äîevery movement, every sound, every detail is designed to make you feel like you‚Äôre right there. Games like *Beat Saber* (where you slice through glowing blocks to the rhythm of music) or *Half-Life: Alyx* (a first-person shooter that places you in a detailed, immersive world) provide experiences that are *alive* in a way traditional gaming just can't match.

But VR isn‚Äôt just for gaming. You can attend virtual concerts, travel to faraway places, or even watch a 360-degree movie where you can look around and feel like you're part of the scene. Imagine watching a live concert in VR where you can turn around and see the crowd, or explore the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu without leaving your home. The level of immersion VR provides will make you wonder why you‚Äôve been watching movies and playing games on a flat screen all this time.

# 2. Travel the World Without Leaving Your Home

Getting a VR headset is like unlocking the ultimate travel experience. VR allows you to explore places you may never be able to visit in real life‚Äîwhether it's because of budget constraints, time, or physical limitations. Ever dreamed of walking on the surface of Mars? Or diving to the bottom of the ocean, exploring vibrant coral reefs and swimming with exotic sea creatures? With VR, all of this is possible. And it doesn‚Äôt just stop with faraway places‚ÄîVR can also help you visit art galleries, museums, and historical sites in full 3D.

Platforms like *Google Earth VR* let you soar over mountains, fly through cities, or land in remote parts of the world. You can stand at the foot of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, stroll through the streets of Tokyo, or even watch a sunset on a beach in Bali. All you need is your VR headset. For people who can‚Äôt travel easily due to health reasons, or those who simply want to explore the world from the comfort of their couch, VR is a game-changer.

# 3. The Future of Fitness and Health

Surprised? Believe it or not, one of the coolest reasons to get a VR headset is to help you stay fit and healthy. VR isn‚Äôt just about sitting back and relaxing‚Äîit‚Äôs about moving, sweating, and getting your body involved in new ways. VR fitness has exploded in recent years, with games and apps designed to make exercise feel more like a game than a workout.

Games like *Beat Saber* (again, yes, it's that good!) or *Superhot VR* combine intense movement and strategy to create a fun, full-body workout. You'll be dancing, dodging, and slashing through virtual worlds‚Äîall while breaking a sweat. Whether you‚Äôre doing high-intensity workouts, practicing yoga, or even just engaging in playful sports like boxing, VR brings a new level of engagement that will make you forget you're even exercising. You‚Äôll find yourself working up a sweat, not because you're focused on hitting a fitness goal, but because you‚Äôre having fun in a completely immersive environment.

And it's not just about gaming‚ÄîVR is also being used in physical therapy. Doctors and therapists are using VR to help patients recover from injuries by providing virtual exercises that engage both the mind and body. If you‚Äôve ever dreaded a long, repetitive rehab session, VR might be the solution to make it more enjoyable and effective.

# 4. Learn in Ways You Never Could Before

Learning doesn‚Äôt have to be boring. With a VR headset, you can completely change the way you experience education. Imagine taking a history class where you‚Äôre not just reading about ancient Rome in a textbook, but *walking* through it. You could tour the Colosseum, meet ancient Romans, and see the world through their eyes. Or maybe you‚Äôre studying biology‚Äîwell, now you can literally explore the human body from the inside, watching cells divide and interact in real-time.

VR allows you to interact with subjects in a way that is both hands-on and deeply immersive. Medical students can practice surgeries without the risk of harming a patient, architecture students can walk through their designs before breaking ground, and anyone can take virtual field trips to places that would otherwise be out of reach. The way VR breaks down barriers and enhances engagement makes it a tool not just for fun but for serious learning.

# 5. Socialize in New and Creative Ways

Not only is VR transforming how we play and learn, but it‚Äôs also changing how we interact with others. While video calls and text chats have allowed us to connect with people from around the world, VR takes it a step further. In social VR platforms like *VRChat*, *AltspaceVR*, or *Rec Room*, you can meet people from different countries, make new friends, and participate in group activities as if you‚Äôre all in the same physical space.

You‚Äôll create your own digital avatar and engage with others in fully immersive environments, whether that‚Äôs hanging out at a virtual bar, playing games together, or attending a live virtual concert. Social VR makes the online experience feel far less flat and more human, offering a depth of interaction that traditional social media or video calls can't.

# 6. Escape and Relax Like Never Before

Life can be stressful. The constant demands of work, school, and daily responsibilities can leave you feeling drained. But with VR, you can escape all of that, even if it‚Äôs just for a little while. Whether it‚Äôs meditating on a quiet beach, taking a walk in a serene forest, or simply lying back and watching the stars from a mountaintop, VR can transport you to peaceful, calming environments where you can relax, unwind, and reset.

Some VR apps are specifically designed for relaxation and mental health, offering immersive, calming experiences that help with stress, anxiety, and even sleep. VR can become your personal sanctuary‚Äîan easy way to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and find a little peace.

# Conclusion: The Future Is Waiting

The reason you should get a VR headset is simple: it‚Äôs not just a gadget. It‚Äôs a portal to new experiences, an immersive way to explore, learn, play, and relax in ways you‚Äôve never imagined. Whether you‚Äôre gaming, traveling, working, or connecting with others, VR is changing the way we interact with the world.

Don‚Äôt let the future pass you by‚Äîstep into a world where anything is possible. All you need is a VR headset to start your journey.**Why VR Headsets Are Cool: A Journey Into the Future**

The second case will introduce Mia Fey as the series-standard assistant girl, a with whom Diego will naturally flirt, main prosecutor (I'm guessing it will be either Byrne Faraday or custom prosecutor), and main detective (I think Tyrell Badd, or Jake Marshall will be just perfect.)
Third case should be made similar to third case in TGAA1, and it should make Diego doubt his clients more.
The fourth case can be done with Manfred von Karma as the prosecutor, and naturally the verdict is guilty, so as not to violate the canon.
And finally the fifth case, I think it is worth making the main villain without much influence, but at the same time tying all the cases together, and also at the end make it so that Diego cries for the first time, having come up with a rule: ""The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's over.""",2,1731145110.0,AceAttorney,1,0.75,False

1gn6hug,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1gn6hug/thank_you_rconstipation_poop_story/,Thank you R/constipation. Poop story.,"I‚Äôm usually someone who has a BM once a week, maybe a few times a week, sometimes it‚Äôll take 2 weeks. This has never really concerned me too much in the past as I just have never FELT the need to go, so it has never caused pain.

2 Days ago, something was different.

Tried to do a BM, won‚Äôt come out. 
Strain. (I‚Äôm so sorry)
Instant pain, still won‚Äôt come out. 
Okay i‚Äôll just leave it and go to work, this happens sometimes and it‚Äôs no biggie.

I come back from work, needing to go, so I go to the toilet.

Not happening.

Starting to hurt now as I feel a constant need to go but cannot. 

Still not panicking but has gotten to the point of saying to my partner: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm uncomfortable‚Äù

The night time comes around, I fall straight asleep. Wake up early morning, okay I‚Äôm sweating now and I feel like I need help. 

Partner drives me home because I think my body may just have poop anxiety, and it might be easier at home.

Nothing. Just pain. Straining again (sorry).

Goes onto google, types:

‚ÄúPoo hurt‚Äù,

just get medical pages pop up. Read them all but terrified of laxatives. Realize it‚Äôs probably impaction (because google is VERY trustworthy). 

Reads about impaction, sees suppository info, sees enemas, freaks out. I don‚Äôt want to do that because i‚Äôm scared (stupid I know but a valid feeling for someone who has never had to consider these things before).

Goes to reddit because real people talking about solutions usually helps me feel better and sometimes there‚Äôs a golden bit of info on reddit that solves my life.

Reads some stories on here that made me realize how difficult constipation is for people. Something that had never really crossed my mind before. You guys have to be some of the bravest people, I can‚Äôt imagine going through what you have been through. I‚Äôm wishing you all comfortable BMs.

I‚Äôm suddenly in a position where I cannot get up from one position. I call off work. Anytime I move, it‚Äôs like someone‚Äôs punching my stomach while it‚Äôs simultaneously cramping up.

Okay I need to do anything to sort this.

‚ÄúMum please help me I don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù

She‚Äôs laughing, she‚Äôs telling me about her nightmare experience with the same sort of thing, she brightens my mood a bit. My dad‚Äôs going to bring me some laxatives from the store.

Phone call: we recommend suppositories for your caseü´µ then take laxatives.

This is not music to my ears.
But anything to stop the pain I suppose.

I can‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôve got the suppositories in hand. I have the laxative bottle in hand. I cannot bring myself to do it. 

I‚Äôm drinking coconut water, i‚Äôm drinking pineapple juice, I drink coffee.

Everytime I go to the toilet, my body tries to sh*t and then just says ‚Äúnope‚Äù and gives up due to the pain. This is where I‚Äôm thinking ‚ÄúWHY DID I STRAIN, OH DEAR GOD WHY DID I STRAIN‚Äù because the pain is so bad. 
The watery stuff is now coming around the MASS. 
Not fun.

I scroll through nearly every post in this subreddit. Some stories are making me nervous. Some stories are making me feel relieved. Every ‚ÄúI just pooped post‚Äù i‚Äôm cheering on and wishing it was me. 

it‚Äôs getting late, only the second night of this horror but it feels intense. I‚Äôm thinking about hospital or doctor, anything to relieve the feeling. I‚Äôm praying i‚Äôll fall asleep and just get it over with while I‚Äôm asleep because anything to not feel the pain would be a relief. 

Wake up this morning. ‚ÄúI just gotta brave it‚Äù (I say to myself for the 15th time in the past 2 days). 

Go to toilet. Don‚Äôt strain (you‚Äôre welcome body).

I poop, with the help of pushing my hand against different places (thank you r/constipation)

I HAVE NEVER FELT SUCH RELIEF IN MY LIFE. 

It hurt the tiniest bit. I‚Äôm still sore from the last couple days, but BM hurt less than just trying to go yesterday.

It took maybe a few minutes, I was 90% sure my toilet wouldn‚Äôt flush but I shouldn‚Äôt have doubted my toilet‚Äôs sheer strength. 

I wanted to thank this subreddit because it brought me so much comfort and so many tips. Maybe after today i‚Äôll buy some prune juice haha.",2,1731144621.0,Constipation,1,1.0,False

The lead up to the binge. (Home alone, fast eating, eating unplanned sweets)

The binge foods. (Bread, wraps, butter, cheese, banana, date syrup, granola) 

The post binge ""recovery"". (Walk, ACV, tea and coffee and coffee and coffee!! Fasting, the journal entries, the thoughts of shame and self hate, burst of intense energy and motivation to ""clean up"" and fix my life). 

ALL THE EXACT SAME. EVERY TIME. 

Like, the times that I've binged on smt that isn't listed up there is few and far between. Even when we have ""bingeable"" junk food at home, I never actually binge on it.

Like I binged yesterdayüôÑüôÑ triggered by being home alone and a packet of chocolate biscuits. I ate a few chocolate biscuits (only had 2, not the binge) and I was sent into a ""binge frenzy"" and rather than eating more of the chocolate biscuits, the thing that I'd actually rather eat- I just instantly went and made wraps w butter, bread w butter, granola w banana and date syrup and like why????

I had been doing so well and successfully stopped a few binges recently, so I KNOW I'm able to do it. i guess I sorta wanted it? But I was eating and there was NOTHING. No enjoyment, no pleasure. I didn't even fucking like the taste of the food!!! 

So it just makes me think about how it's seriously JUST a habit at this pont, fully ingrained into my brain. I didn't even want those foods but I ate them anyway because I was in ""binge mode"" and that's just what I eat in ""binge mode"". 

As disappointed as I am in myself. I'm choosing to see the good. I see this merely as it is now, a habit. And I also acknowledge my ability to *not* eat food that I don't want to eat e.g. the rest of those chocolate cookies. If I can not eat those, I can choose to not eat the other stuff. And I HAVE!! So many times recently I HAVE chosen to walk away I HAVE THE POWER. I HAVE AND I CAN AND I WILL. 

I have to remember that. I have to remember 3 things, I think.

1) I am allowed to eat sweets and chocolate and junk. 

2) I have the ability and power to choose not to eat certain foods. I am in control of my own actions. Urges cannot do that. 

3) The foods I binge- I dont even enjoy! I didn't enjoy the taste of anything yesterday. Plain wraps and bread w just butter?! That's not as nice as the sandwich I could've made if I was actually hungry! Date syrup and granola?? I actively *dislike* the taste kf date syrup I realised yesterday. It's not as good as if I just had another chocolate biscuit!!!

# Mount Kilimanjaro

Mount Kilimanjaro is located three degrees south of the equator in Northeastern Tanzania. It is the tallest mountain in Africa and is the highest free-standing mountain in the world. This immense mountain is made up of three volcanoes: Shira, Mawenzi, and our goal, Kibo, the tallest one in the middle.  
Of the famous highest seven peaks in the world, this is the easiest to get to and the easiest to climb. It requires no technical climbing experience, and any moderately fit person can summit the mountain. Though Mount Kilimanjaro is frequented by an estimated 50,000 hikers a year, the trek is not to be taken lightly. Sufficient physical conditioning and a lot of preparations must be made in order to ensure a safe, enjoyable experience.  
[Kilimanjaro Climbing Routes](https://twendeafricatours.com/mount-kilimanjaro-climbing)**:**¬†All the Kilimanjaro routes we offer are very scenic and offer an exhilarating experience. The success rate for reaching the peak is greatly determined by your ability to acclimate to the high altitude. Spending more days ascending the mountain will give your body more time to adequately adjust to the altitude and low oxygen environment.  
**Trekking:**¬†Daily travel time varies depending on the route and day. On average you should expect to be hiking for 4-6 hours per day with the exception of ‚Äúsummit day‚Äù, which is an arduous 11-16 hour trek. Our guides will purposely set a slow walking pace to ensure group cohesion (‚Äúpole, pole‚Äù, or ‚Äúslowly, slowly‚Äù) in order to give each climber adequate time to acclimatize and adapt to the thinning air. Expect a lot of uphill and downhill walking, which is why you should make sure you‚Äôre sufficiently conditioned before your trip.  
Each route we use on our Kilimanjaro trek is well defined and screened for safety, but after heavy rains the lower slopes and areas near the summit can become muddy. The guides will help you along the path and ensure you‚Äôre safe when you encounter difficult areas.  
During the day you‚Äôll carry a medium sized backpack carrying the essential items you‚Äôll need for that day of climbing until you reach that night‚Äôs campsite. You should only carry essential supplies such as extra layers of clothing, water, snacks, sunscreen, insect repellent, etc.  
**Climate:**¬†Because bad weather affects your chances of reaching Kilimanjaro‚Äôs peak, choosing the right time of year is imperative to your summiting success.  
Kilimanjaro‚Äôs climate varies greatly depending on the time of year. It‚Äôs best to plan your climb during the driest months of the year ‚Äì Jan, Feb and Aug, Sep. But you‚Äôll experience reasonable weather any time between January-mid March and June-October. We don‚Äôt recommend trekking during the long rainy season between the end of March and the beginning of June or the shorter rainy season from November to the beginning of December.  
You should prepare to pass through a variety of weather conditions ‚Äì from forest terrains and desert valleys to snowcapped mountain trails and freezing temperatures near the peak. You can find information on what to pack for your Kilimanjaro trek on faqs page.  
**Best time to climb Mount Kilimanjaro:**¬†When to climb Mount Kilimanjaro safe, how to climb mount Kilimanjaro climbing route, When to climb Mount Kilimanjaro? or How to climb mount Kilimanjaro?  
The fact is most of the month have few rainy days makes it possible for climb in relatively good condition all year round.  
During the rain period of March and May, cloud tends to pile up and over the summit, dropping snow on top and at base. Visibility can be limited by cloud cover even when no rainfall. The temperature at this time of the year is relative warm.  
The dry season beginning in the rate June and through July can be very cold at night but usually is clear of cloud.  
August and September are also cool and can have completely clear days, but usually a dripping cloud belt girdles the mountain above the forest moorland. The summit can be totally clear.  
The shorter rainy period of October to December often has thunderstorms that pass over the mountain, dropping rains as they go. Typical the cloud disappear in the evening leaving the nights and morning very clear with excellent visibility.  
January and February are usually dry, warm and clear with brief rain showers which make good climbing condition.  
Even thought one can climb thought out the year, January, February and September are the best month with July, August, November and December are also good.

# Serengeti National Park

The Serengeti is vast and beautiful; it's one of Africa's most captivating safari areas. The sheer amount of game here is amazing: estimates suggest up to about two million wildebeest, plus perhaps half a million zebra, hundreds of thousands of Thompson's gazelle, and tens of thousands of impala, Grant's gazelle, topi (tsessebe), hartebeest, eland and other antelope - all hunted by the predators for which these plains are famous.  
Some of this game resides permanently in 'home' areas, which are great for safaris all year round. But many of the wildebeest and zebra take part in the¬†[migration](https://twendeafricatours.com/6days-great-wildebeest-migration)¬†\- an amazing spectacle that's one of the greatest wildlife shows on earth. If you plan carefully, it's still possible to witness this in wild and remote areas.  
The Greater Serengeti ecosystem  
The Serengeti National Park itself covers about 15,000km2¬†of mostly flat or gently rolling grasslands, interspersed with the occasional rock outcrops, or kopjes. But this is just the centre of a whole ecosystem which covers more than double that area, and includes Grumeti Reserve, Ikorongo Game Reserve, Loliondo Controlled Area, Maswa Game Reserve, part of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and also Kenya's relatively small Maasai Mara Game Reserve. This combined area is often referred to as the Greater Serengeti area, or the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem.  
Southern plains  
Vast short-grass plains cover the south of Serengeti National Park, stretching into the north of Ngorongoro Conservation Area, the south-west Loliondo and Maswa Game Reserve. Occasionally there are small kopjes which, like the forests around Lake Ndutu, harbour good populations of resident game. However, around these oases of permanent wildlife, the majority of this area is flat and open. It's alive with grazing wildebeest from around late-November to April, but can be very empty for the rest of the year. Places to stay here include  
The Seronera area  
In the heart of the national park, just to the north of the short-grass plains, Seronera has all the best features of the Serengeti and also, sadly, its worst. Scenically, it's a lovely area - with open plains, occasional kopjes and lines of hills to add interest. The resident game here is phenomenal, with high densities of relaxed leopards, cheetah and lion. These live off the resident herbivores, as well as the migrating game. The migration passes through here in April/May, but Seronera is within reach of both the Southern Plains and the Western Corridor - so from about November to June, it can be used as a base to see the migration. Seronera's big drawback is that it is always busy; places to stay include:  
Western Corridor  
Stretching to the west, almost to Lake Victoria, the Serengeti narrows into what's known as the Western Corridor. The key feature of this area is the two rivers, the Grumeti and the Mbalageti, which run almost parallel, each supporting a band of most, evergreen riparian forest. This area sustains a very good permanent game population, including plenty of zebra and wildebeest, all the predators and forest 'specialists' like colobus monkeys. The birdife is particularly varied. The migration passes through between about May and July - pausing to gather momentum before crossing the crocodile-rich waters of the Grumeti River, into the Grumeti Reserve. Camps in the Serengeti's Western Corridor include:  
Northern Serengeti  
Stretching from Seronera for about 100km north, to the Kenyan border, the northern Serengeti is gently rolling country, broken by small rivers and occasional hills and kopjes. There are good permanent populations of wildlife in several areas here, including the very beautiful Lobo Kopje. It's interesting, varied country that's far from the park's main entry point in the south - and hence it receives delightfully few visitors. The further you go north, the fewer vehicles you see. Even when the migration is here, between about August and October, you can still enjoy spectacular crossings of the Mara River. A particularly stunning are is the wild Lamai Wedge - the area of land between the Mara River and the Kenya Border - which includes the picturesque Wogakuria Kopjie, and a beautiful series of game-rich valleys and plains. This is the only area of the national park where off-road driving is acceptable. Here, we suggest you stay at:  
Grumeti Reserves  
Singita Grumeti Reserves covers almost 1,500km¬†2¬†of private reserves which run along the north side of the Western Corridor. Within this are three, very different luxury lodges. All offer unrivalled exclusivity for watching the migration as it journeys north, and recycle all of their profits into local conservation and community development initiatives.  
Loliondo Reserve  
West of the Serengeti National Park, between the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and the Kenyan border, lies Loliondo game Controlled Area - an area belonging to the Maasai tribes that live there. The western side of this, beside the park, is very much part of the Serengeti's ecosystem; it has much resident game and the migration passes through here as well.  
There are a few camps here which have the flexibility to offer night drives and walks, often using Maasai guides - and visits to local Maasai villages. Around about October and November, there's a good chance to see part of the migration here, as it returns south.  
Trips to the Serengeti  
Sadly, the Serengeti doesn't always live up to its potential. It's easy to end up with a herd of vehicles around you, destroying any sense of wilderness. It's tempting to opt to rush around on dusty, corrugated roads with little time to stop. It's also easy to simply miss the migration, which isn't nearly as predictable these days as many will tell you.  
Because of this, planning a safari here can be complicated; we need to guide you to choose the right camps at the right time of year, and get the best experience possible - especially when the wildebeest migration does vary every year.

# Ngorongoro Conservation Area

In 1951, the enormous Serengeti National Park was declared, encompassing the present Serengeti, plus the Ngorongoro area and surrounding Crater Highlands. Today, this is split into the present-day Serengeti National Park, and the current Ngorongoro Conservation Area. The conservation area now encompasses a large area of the short-grass plains on the southern side of the Serengeti Plain and also the Ngorongoro Highlands, a range of largely extinct ancient volcanoes on the west side of the Great Rift Valley.  
Ngorongoro Crater Safari  
The showpiece of the conservation area is undoubtedly the Ngorongoro Crater which was created when a large volcano exploded and collapsed on itself two to three million years ago. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978 and is the largest intact volcanic caldera in the world.  
It measures about 16-19km in diameter, with walls of 400-610m in height. However you measure it, the Crater is a strong candidate for any list of the world's greatest natural wonders. It is renowned both for its geological splendour, and for being a natural reserve which is home to some of the densest large mammal populations found anywhere in Africa.  
Ngorongoro Wildlife Safari  
Due to the enclosed nature of the Crater, it has virtually formed its own ecosystem. Besides the stunning scenery, one of the main attractions of this area is the variety of flora and fauna found in a remarkably compact area all year round. In the Southwest corner there is the Lerai Forest, which is mainly comprised of yellow fever trees (a member of the acacia family). To the north of the forest is a shallow soda lake called Lake Magadi and to the east you will find Gorigor Swamp and the Ngoitokitok Springs where pods of hippo are to be found. The north of the Crater is, on the whole, much drier and consists of the open grasslands which characterise the Crater floor; this is where the majority of the resident game resides. You are guaranteed to see large concentrations of game on any Ngorongoro safari. The mineral-rich floor of this spectacular bowl is largely flat, open and covered in nutritious grasses - much to the liking of large herds of zebra and wildebeest, which graze here. These extensive open plains are also home to herds of buffalo, Thomson's gazelle, Grant's gazelle and tsessebe (often called topi). You'll also find East Africa's best population of black rhinos here, which are often seen in open grasslands. Breeding herds of elephants pass through the Ngorongoro Crater itself only rarely, but you will see a scattering of old bulls, including some of the biggest tuskers left alive in Africa today. The only surprising absentees from the Crater are Impala and Giraffe; it is thought that this is perhaps because of the lack of open woodlands and browsing species of trees which these two tend to thrive on.  
The high numbers of herbivores support the densest populations of predators found anywhere in Africa. The reliable presence of these predators has helped to make a Ngorongoro safari so popular. The Crater's lion population varies significantly over time, the one constant being their complete disregard of vehicles; they will hunt within yards of a vehicle, and when exhausted even seek shade beside them. Spotted hyenas are even more common here, often competing with the lion, and there are a small but growing number of cheetahs. Leopards are around, especially in the vicinity of the Lerai Forest. Side-striped and the lovely golden jackal are often seen skulking around, whilst bat-eared foxes are a rarer sight.  
Having waxed lyrical about the Ngorongoro Crater's wildlife, the reality of safaris there isn't always as amazing. The sheer number of vehicles in the crater, combined with its open environment, can destroy any sense of wilderness. It can feel crowded and busy. Often, this will be mitigated by amazing game sightings, but not always. So whilst Ngorongoro's wildlife is stupendous, the Ngorongoro Crater safari experience isn't always as good as you might imagine.  
Access to Ngorongoro Safari  
The Ngorongoro crater and wider conservation area is easily accessible. There is a daily light aircraft flight to Arusha from Dar (other airstrips in Tanzania also fly to Arusha) where you would then be met by a safari guide in a close-sided pop-top 4 x 4 safari vehicle. Your guide will stay with you for your time down in the Crater, and possibly longer. The drive from Arusha is around 4 hours to begin a Ngorongoro Crater safari.  
Another alternative is to fly to Manyara airstrip, which is about an hour from the Crater. Depending on where you're staying - you may be met by the lodge, or picked up by a private driver guide.  
Alternatively, you could choose to stay on the nearby Rift Valley Escarpment in an area often referred to as Karatu. The lodges and camps here are all less than about 20km from the Crater and have a lot more character than the aforementioned lodges. Gibb's Farm, Plantation Lodge and the Ngorongoro Farmhouse Lodge are all true of this.

# Tarangire National Park

Tarangire National Park covers an undulating area of 2,600km2, between the plains of the Maasai Steppe to the south-east, and the lakes of the Great Rift Valley to the north and west. The northern part of Tarangire is dominated by the perennial Tarangire River, which flows through increasingly incised ravines until it leaves the north-western corner of the park to flow into Lake Burungi. In the south are a series of vast 'swamps' which dry into verdant plains during the dry season.

Although Tarangire is one of only four parks on Tanzania's sometimes frenetic 'northern circuit', it is often either missed out, or given less than 24 hours, by the many relatively cursory mini-bus tours. This means that few get beyond the park's busy northern section, where the majority of camps and lodges is situated.

If you decide to come to Tarangire at all, then we recommend spending a few days in the south of the park, which gets few visitors and retains a real air of wilderness.

Flora & Fauna of Tarangire National Park  
The park's most obvious features are the permanent Tarangire River, which runs the length of it, and the vast 'swamps' - which are, in fact, dry for most of the year. Despite the fact that Tarangire is drier than the Serengeti, its vegetation is generally much more dense including densely packed elephant grass, large areas of mixed acacia woodlands and some lovely ribbons of riverine forest.

# Arusha National Park

Arusha National Park is often overlooked by travelers rushing to the more famous sights of the Ngorongoro Crater and Serengeti. However, with a little time, Arusha National Park offers some lovely walking in the foothills of Mount Meru and canoeing on the Momela Lakes, plus gentle game drives. If you have the time it is well worth a day or two.  
There are a range of activities to do in Arusha National Park. This includes walking safaris which are always accompanied by a ranger and last for a maximum of four hours, during which you would stop for a break at one of the park's lovely picnic sites. You can also explore the far reaches of the park by vehicle, taking in some of the lovely views and keeping an eye out for wildlife. Another great activity here and one not found in other safari parks in Tanzania, is a canoeing safari which allows you to explore the Momela Lakes.

# Lake Manyara National Park

Lake Manyara National Park is very easy to access: it's about 90 minutes' drive from Arusha and barely an hour from the Ngorongoro Crater. Because of this, some of the northern side of the park can get very busy, especially in the afternoons. To see the park at its best, we recommend that you either stay within the park or spend two nights somewhere close, entering the park early for a full-day safari.

Safaris to Lake Manyara National Park  
Many people will often visit Lake Manyara National Park enroute to or from the Crater, as part of a short half day safari. Often they won't even spend the night in the area, but will rush on, so as to include as many areas, in as short a space of time as possible.

Though this can save on money, we feel that it restricts time and therefore only allows for visits to the busy northern quarter of the park. This can result in a rushed experience of Lake Manyara that can sometimes result in disappointment.

Instead we would recommend the following two options for visiting Lake Manyara National Park. The first is to stay within the park itself, either in a permanent camp or a more mobile one. This tends to be the more expensive choice, but it is certainly the best way to explore the park. It enables you to be on safari before most others, and explore deeper into the park which day visitors won't have the time to do. Without any doubt, staying inside the park is the best wildlife experience.

Secondly you can opt to stay somewhere outside, but near to the park gate. From here you can enter the park early and enjoy the whole day exploring. There are some economical accommodation options outside the park, some of which are dotted along the top of the Rift Valley Escarpment with great views down across the park

Entrances to the National Park  
There are two main entrances to Lake Manyara National Park, a gate in the north and in the south. Almost everybody uses the northern gate, since the majority of accommodation options are situated here and as a result the northern part of the park is by far the busier one. The gate in the far south is not commonly used and also has restricted access. Only few camps and lodges can use this entrance. Please contact us for more information on camps that can enter via this quiet gate.

# Chemka Hot Springs

The drive to Kikuletwa Hotsprings also known as Rundugai Hot springs or commonly known as Chemka Hot Springs will initially start on a paved road toward Arusha, before turning left onto a gravel road about 30 minutes later. The road will take you thru the gorgeous African countryside pass bush landed, dry riverbeds, baobab and acacia trees among many others.

This vast area, which used to be a hunting ground for Europeans during the 1800s, is home to members of many different tribes, peacefully co-existing as neighbors. Although the game has long since migrated, it is still a haven to many animal species, including a variety of birds.  
When you reach at Kikuletwa village it will appear as an oasis surrounded by sprawling fig trees, in the middle of this semi-arid landscape. You will see crystal clear water bubbling from underground caves, giving the impression that it is boiling, hence the name ""Hot springs"".

Crowdfunding remains one of the most effective ways to reach a wide audience for fundraising for disabilities. By setting up a campaign on platforms like WhyDonate, you can tell your story, explain the needs, and attract donations from supporters around the world. This is especially helpful if you have a network willing to share your campaign on social media to expand its reach.

# 2. Virtual Walk-a-Thons or Challenges

Hosting a virtual walk-a-thon or fitness challenge can engage a community of supporters and raise awareness. Participants can set their own distance goals or time limits, and friends and family can donate to support their efforts. For example:

* **Miles for Mobility**: Each participant commits to a specific distance and raises funds per mile they achieve, with proceeds supporting accessibility resources.
* **Adaptive Fitness Challenges**: These can include activities that cater to different abilities, allowing participants to choose exercises that match their capabilities.

# 3. Auction or Raffle Events

Hosting an online or in-person auction can bring in significant donations while encouraging local businesses to contribute items or services.

I ended breaking up with that specific guy and we'll call him ""Puke"". I met my current boyfriend through Puke with him trying to find a way for me to ""get high and stop bitching and being sad."" From the beginning my current boyfriend we'll call him ""Shawn."" Shawn didn't like the way Puke would talk or ""handle"" me. While talking to him as I was hitting his pen Shawn and I were talking and then Puke grabbed me and started screaming at me in a hallway. For context I(15) female, Puke (17) male, Shawn(18)male. This is some background to understand a little bit more for what is to come. After that Shawn and I didn't talk again.¬†

Fast forward three months after I ended things with Puke and was going through therapy to help with the ptsd. I was a mess when a guy I thought was cute and recognized talked to me and my friends he offered to put a couple shooters in my coffee to see how it would taste. At the time drinking or getting high was how I was wrongly coping, so I said yes (in a couple weeks I was turning 16 keep this in mind). So I left and Shawn and I start talking and we really hit it off. We talked about exes and how both have never had a good stable relationship I now know this was us bonding over common negative expieriences.¬†

Fast forward three months we've now been sneaking around having a relationship behind everyones back. I am now 16 and Shawn is now 19. We did some really stupid stuff and we did the ""giggity"" about 3 or 4 times. I was head over heels. Skip to almost our 8 month mark, I got laced with molly when smoking weed. I don't really remember the night, but I did some really stupid things and cheated. I don't remember, but for that I know I was in the wrong. I'm now sober, I got baptized and my relationship with God has never been stronger, and I am trying to truly better myself. At this time in my life I have a lot of difficult things going on, and Shawn knows this. He forgave me and gave me another chance. I finally told him how he wasn't my first time and how my ex took that from me... about an hour later he wanted to do the ""giggity"" over the phone. I wasn't in the mood, but it was the first I had seen him happy the whole night so I forced myself and tried.. he made me ball my eyes out after saying I was ""dry like a granny"".. instantly I started seeing red flags after thinking of our past and the things that would happen and how he speaks to me. I'm thinking of leaving him completely.¬†

I want to end things, but i'm very worried that he'll hurt himself or worse.. i'm scared because he's said that he would if I ever left him before multiple times and/or me and/or if I moved on.

I met my BFF not long after we both moved to the same city. We had a lot in common and quickly became good friends. We spent a lot of time together, we would hang out most days for 2 years. 

When my now husband proposed to me, she was the first person I told and celebrated with (she helped me with ring shopping so we both knew it was coming) and after a few months of being engaged, I asked her to be my bridesmaid. She was thrilled, as was I, and we celebrated over a glass of wine.

During the planning stages, it was extremely difficult to get any help from her and my other bridesmaid (my second BM was in another state so couldn't make it to a lot of things but helped as much as she could), to the point of my then fianc√© calling her whilst we were at the shops to come and meet us like we had organised to try on BM dresses and shoes for the wedding. We were getting dangerously close to running out of time at this stage, so it really couldn't wait. I am completely understanding and supportive of the fact that she has 2 children, but didn't really ask much of anyone when it came to planning the wedding and didn't really think this was too much to ask for, especially considering I was paying for everything for my 2 BM's. After my fianc√© spoke to her, she came and met us, we found the dresses and shoes and checked them off the list.

Planning my bachelorette party was an impossible mission for my 2 BM's, despite having 3 months to plan it, and the day before it was meant to be booked for there was still nothing booked! My husband and I ended up booking something for us all to make sure we still all had a super fun night out, which we did.

The day before the wedding I had a huge meltdown and my 2 BM's helped me through it and the day of the wedding they were absolutely amazing! Anything that went wrong they dealt with and hid from me and made sure my day was absolutely perfect. The day after my wedding, there was a huge fight in my family and a lot of drama happened that caused me to go no contact with most of my family for a solid 8 months, which she was extremely supportive of and helped me through... until the fight between us happened.

So one weekend, a couple of months after the wedding, we were all meeting at my house for a BBQ dinner. My husband and I had spent the entire day doing a deep clean of the house, so it was sparkly ‚ú®Ô∏è. My BFF and her family had been out to the beach that day so the kids were tired from a big day, so we all just sat down and chilled out until dinner.

Whilst we were sitting at the table eating dinner, her daughter decided to be a bit cheeky and whilst staring me dead in the eyes, slowly started tipping her cup upside down and when she got half way, turned it completely upside down. I didn't know the cup was now empty as it was full of water at the start of dinner, so I said ""No wait, stop! Don't tip the water over!"" which was enough to upset her daughter. In my mind, I had just spent the entire day cleaning and didn't want to have to clean up anything else, let alone a full cup of water being spilled and just reacted to the situation. Once I realised that the cup was empty, I apologised and said ""wow, she really is tired after today"" to which my BFF replied ""what did you expect to happen after you roused on her""? I was gobsmacked and didn't really know how to respond to this, so I just let it go. Not long after, they went home and everything was good... or so I thought.

For the next week, she completely ignored any calls, messages, etc from me. That week, I was hit by a car whilst riding my motorbike to work and sent a photo of ice-packs tied to my knee with a tea towel and received a response from her husband, but nothing from her. I just let it go, thinking nothing of it.

That weekend, my Aunty had invited me to go see a movie and have dinner with her, so I went to spend some time with her to relax and have a fun day out after a long week of work and injuries. Whilst we were in the movies, my BFF tried to call, which I didn't see until the movie was finished and I got into my car. I called her back to see what she wanted, and the conversation went about as well as a house fire on an isolated island full of dry bushland.

She started to gaslight me, accusing me of ""being not okay"" (I was going through some stuff with my family and found out some pretty upsetting things earlier the day of the BBQ, which she knew about because I rang her and told her about it), asked me to meet up for a coffee o have an ""adult conversation and hug it out"" (I was 1.5 hours away and already had plans, so that wasn't happening), told me I don't take accountability for anything, went on about defence mechanisms, etc. When I told her that this was reactive abuse, she didn't like it and we went round and round for about 20 mins until I said ""I'm out trying to have a nice day with my Aunty and husband and don't have time for this"" to which she accused me of not having time for her, asking why our friendship wasn't important enough to me to talk it out and accusing me of being a bad friend. I hung up on her mid sentence because by this stage, we were going round in circles getting nowhere, and quite simply I had had enough of the conversation and wanted to enjoy the rest of my day. I was visibly upset after I got out the car and told my Aunty and husband about it. After having a quick chat about it, we forgot about it for the rest of the day and went out to continue on with out activities and have some fun.

The following week, my BFF and I had a few text exchanges where everything was laid out. She told me that the table was already messy because we had just eaten dinner, I pointed out that this was irrelevant and the disrespect to myself and my husband from her for blaming me instead of pulling up her daughter was unacceptable. After a few days of this and her refusing to acknowledge that she did anything wrong and apologising, she told me she needed time to think about everything which could take months, so I decided that I was not going to let this slide or wait around for her and ended the friendship.

My husband and I went back to where we got married for our 1 year anniversary, and I started to really miss my ex-BFF, so i reached out to her asking if we could meet up for a coffee and a chat to see if we could move past this, to which I received radio silence. Her husband thinks this is all ridiculous and I did nothing wrong, as do my husband, family and friends that I have spoken to about this, but I'm still not sure if I was in the wrong.

So  I'm here now asking all of you, AITA?

I don't know if 40's people can relate, Pag 40's kna kase, you would rather seek slow mornings over malling, deep talks over clubbing,  cuddles over going out, sex over gyn.. coffee over wine... Deep conversation and sweet nothings, we have everything na, graduates na... She is stable na, ako ganon din, mas mayaman nga lang cia.

To me it doesn't matter so long as our humor and intellect match. We can't be with together kase hindi pa naman ng kame. What she knows is that crush ko cia. She's a doctor and I'm a digital marketer-agency owner. 

And because I'm not a fan of slowburn scenarios.. I will pursue her na... Next month, like 3 days before she will be on leave. I will be sending her set of flowers on delivery + different gifts on each hospitals where she is connected with. 

Yung 3rd place pala, ipapaabot ko sa friend ko na ka work niya

She is a very private person so I want to hear from the ladies here who are Introverts, by doing the act .. mapapakilig ko ba cia? Or maooffend ko ba cia, I don't know her home address kase eh so I don't wanna go naman to that path kase parang ang private na non. I'm not a masc nga pala I'm a femme. She is a femme too. I'm 43 and she might be around 45. Reason I'm doing this kase if it's a no.. malaman ko na rin.. And nakakagoodvibes din kase sumabay sa season ng simbang Gabi di ba üòÄüòÄüòÄ. So happy lang... Gift #1 would be perfume, #2 bottle of wine, #3 is a bathrobe na maganda. Very special kase I want her to feel special. Pag naintroga cia sken might be my key to our first date na rin soon. I'm hoping for the best but if not, it's totally fine.

Ngayon ko lang ito gagawin sa buong buhay ko sa totoo lang. Suerte tlga ito ni crush haha Any reactions, suggestions with my actions let me know... Kung kayo nakatanggap (as an introvert, what would you prefer) - take note... Mayaman na cia. Kaya I want to make it simple Pero classic 

Thanks guys!!! This will help me understand introverts more kase ako, ambivert ako leaning towards extrovert.",6,1731140388.0,PHSapphics,6,0.88,False
1gn5j0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1gn5j0l/lengthy_pass_writeup_as_an_adhd_chaotic_mess_3/,Lengthy PASS write-up as an ADHD chaotic mess <3,"For context im a pretty average student, US IMG, on ADHD meds. I took around 6-7 months to study for this exam.

**My study resources:**

* I never studied much during med school so I figured I'd need around 6 months to get all my basics down and also to account for my pretty poor memory lol
* I used bootcamp as my MAIN resource it is just amazing!!!! ADHD folks this is for YOU!! I can only focus on things if I'm interested in it and bootcamp lectures are very engaging, short, and they just overall teach really well. Shoutout to David from bootcamp I fucking hate OBG so much but his humor and chill vibes made it soo much more bearable!!! 
* I barely touched first aid, I ended up only looking at my bootcamp notes that i annotated. For the qbank also I did the entire bootcamp qbank and i got through maybe only like 40% of uworld lol
* I wasted a lot of time setting up my anki deck only to abandon it after like 2 days. Idk that shit is just useless for me I prefer to review by going over my entire subject notes in one go, even better if I pace around and explain it to a poor civilian (sorry dad- he's fallen asleep to me explaining immunology too many times rip)
* Also holy hell there's no way I would've passed without visual mnemonic aids!! Sketchy for micro and pixorize for biochem, pharma, immunology, and neuroanatomy. I have pdfs of the notes i made on another post. Also I did use sketchy pathology for a few really hard to remember topics like bone tumors and ovarian tumors, it was pretty useful.
* Also i started skimming through the mehlman pdfs in the last month it reallyyy boosted by nbme scores and it was amazing for revision since its so short and concise!
* Biostats i did randy neil and i looked through the mehlman pdf- there were just a few equation questions and they weren't direct easy questions, so just know your concepts really well.
* And don't forget to go through the nbme images pdfs in the last month or so, a few images got repeated for my real exam! And of course all the nbme questions are super super high yield know those concepts inside out-  a lot of those same concepts and even the same questions came up in my exam. 

**How I actually sat down and studied:**

* So to begin with I made a list of subjects I hated and subjects I liked, and then I would alternate doing them. So for me Cardio was a good subject and OBG was a shitty subject. I'd alternate the subjects so I wouldn't have a fucking aneurysm doing the ""bad"" subjects continuously. 
* I would give myself a deadline of so many days to complete each subject although holy shit Biochem sucked the life out of me I spent like 3 times the expected days on that shit.
* After each subject I would do the bootcamp qbank of that subject- their qbank is pretty small and concise  so its doable.
* So I would take my meds first thing in the morning with some coffee around 8 am, have breakfast, fuck around and procrastinate and usually start studying around 10 am. For subjects that were really interesting I just powered through without taking any breaks- just watching bootcamp on 1.5x speed and annotating notes on my tablet. Also always keep captions on while watching vids.
* After I finally finished all the bootcamp videos and the qbank I started cramming uworld subjectwise. I only finished 40% in a month and my average was barely around 60%.
* When it came to subjects I hated, various things I did to keep myself accountable was: 

1) Try sitting in an open area like a library, your living room, a coffee shop with other people around with noise cancelling headphones- so if you start procrastinating they can see everything- SHAME yourself into studying lmao

2) Sometimes I would join these online study groups on discord- and SHARE your screen for accountability and keep your camera on too! Or if you have friends who are also getting work done do this with them on discord. Body doubling works wonders. Make sure to tell someone what u plan on doing each day and at night tell them if you did it or not.

3) If you're a real degenerate like me- sometimes for reallyyy boring subjects I would play music on very low volume while watching videos, and maybe crank up the speed of the video a little more. And sometimes if I was feeling particularly burnt out I'd play a random youtube video on mute in a pop up screen - something not too distracting eg a gaming stream, slime videos, cat videos, cafe vlogs, etc. 

Tbh studying very slowly is still better than not studying at all lol- ABANDON your perfectionist tendencies that shit will NOT WORK for these fucking exams

4) Motivational music works wonders for me- something about romanticizing your life to feel like an anime main character just does it for me. This is a playlist I've compiled over years: there's a little bit of everything- marvel, pixar osts, anime osts, mario kart music, and its all instrumentals ONLY - for no distractions.

[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4BwJZOZG6kZY4OQoYFsT3d?si=4afbb5c651f94730](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4BwJZOZG6kZY4OQoYFsT3d?si=4afbb5c651f94730)

5) I would switch up my pomodoro sessions sometimes I'd do 1 hour study with 20 min breaks but near the end my willpower was paper thin so I was doing 25 min study with 5 min breaks. Up to you- I think it really depends on which subject you're tackling.

6) Have trouble sitting still like me? If you by any chance have a yoga ball- use it instead of a chair im so serious. If you can afford a standing desk I'm so jealous. And unless you absolutely need to be sitting down just go and pace around and study- it'll give you a sense of urgency and get your blood flowing. 

7) Also another good technique is to switch up where you're studying when you feel yourself getting bored- you can go anywhere as long as you put on your noise cancelling headphones - eg kitchen counter, living room table, your siblings bedroom, your parents bedroom, your balcony, your friends house, a library, etc.

8) If you have a whiteboard or a chalkboard i found it really helpful while doing qbanks to write everything out because sometimes just seeing the clues to a vignette written out will trigger something in your deep memory. Also really good to use it as if you're a teacher trying to explain to a kid (yourself)- that combination of writing and saying it out loud (try speaking in a goofy accent or making stupid/vulgar jokes) really helps you remember shit

9) This is obvious but KEEP YOUR SURROUNDINGS CLEAN - NO clutter, only the few basic stuff thats required for studying. Even better if you keep a timer on your desk right in front of your face. Noise cancelling headphones are so lifesaving use them even if you're sitting in your room alone! You don't even realize how much random background sounds are disturbing your focus!!! Better yet you can practice using earplugs like the ones you use on exam day.

10) I used a loot of different study apps:

**Forest:** really cute I wish I had friends to do the plant trees together option! It's very aesthetic and you can set it to lock you out of certain apps while you study

**Yeolpumta:** this one I used religiously to track my study time- this is really important for ADHD peeps since we are soo good at losing track of time! Plus it helps me track how much time I think I'll need for a subject versus how much time I actually take- so I can plan the next subjects accordingly. Also their feature to study with other people and join study groups is really great for accountability, generally not feeling alone while studying and it forces you to get off your phone while you study.

**Focumon:** this is soo great for pomodoro and making a to do list and getting that satisfaction of crossing off all my to do list stuff. Basically you get to collect these pixelated focumon creatures theyre so adorable! And to level them up and evolve them you need to work to collect level up materials. Everyday there's a free pull so you can get focumon or trainer skins. Think gacha game but for working adults lol.

**Think Divergent:** Basically this app will pair you with someone randomly- so you can get a body double online. It's very chill since it's all through texting.

On my laptop I downloaded **Read Aloud** browser extension- so instead of trying to read things I can just listen to it. Or if you're using microsoft edge you can use the built in read aloud function; it's really fun to use because I love changing the voice and hearing my notes being read in different accents - especially the Irish accent that dude gives me so much joy

**Stayfree:** I downloaded this as an app on my phone and as a browser extension- I set it to ask me everytime I open up a non educational app/site, how much time will I spend on this site. And after that time is up it automatically closes the app and doesn't let you open it until the cooldown time is over.

**Lock Me Out:** Sometimes when I really struggled with going back to studying after taking a break, I'd use this app- every time I'm going to take a break I'd set this app to lock me out of all my apps at a certain time- so I'd be forced to end my break and start studying again.

**NBME Scores:**

* So I started doing nbmes a month before my exam and I did one every week: NBME 29: 58%, NBME 30: 61%, NBME 31: 63%. I only had like a week left till my exam and I hadn't finished properly revising so I postponed my exam for 2 weeks, because I wanted at least 2 scores above 65% before i went for the exam.
* Then I did one week of solid revision with my notes and mehlman pdfs and a bit of uworld in between when I got bored of reading notes. I took NBME 28 and got 73%, and a few days later i took the free120 and got 73% again lol. So I was pretty confident, and I went and wrote it since it said I have a 99% chance of passing.

**Day of the Exam:**

* The day before my exam I didnt study much. I tried to do some revision stuff which I had left to the last minute but I was burnt out from studying and tired from travelling so I just kinda fucked around on my phone that day.
* I slept around 11 pretty fine not very stressed but then I kept waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to sleep and I finally dragged myself out of bed at 4 am since I couldn't sleep.
* In the morning I had some standard indian food for breakfast, I barely had any appetite though. In the morning I just crammed all the equations in my head again and revised some topics which I hadn't seen in a while. I still didn't feel completely ready for the exam but meh I guess you'd have to be a psychopath to think that. 
* I packed a lot of food- some granola bars, chocolate covered coffee beans, coconut water, regular water, a cheese sandwich, sliced apples, a cookie.
* Most important two things you MUST have is your exam permit and your passport id. And show up to your test center at least half an hour beforehand. Factor in for traffic, bad weather, getting lost, etc.
* I hadn't planned out how I was gonna take my breaks since I figured I'd just see how I feel after each block. In the end I didn't take a dedicated lunch break instead I took a 5-10 min break after each block- went to the bathroom, I tried to eat a few bites of something but didnt have much of an appetite. I actually barely ate anything I would NOT recommend doing this. I recommend bringing some kinda moist food because my mouth was so dry from anxiety that I didn't feel like eating my food.
* I also brought a paracetamol and my adhd meds in a plastic bag. I brought my own ear plugs which I ended up not using since they gave me noise cancelling headphones which were pretty good although theyre pretty annoying to wear with glasses.
* I really regret not bringing EYE DROPS - oh my goddd my eyes were red and burning by the end!! You do NOT get to adjust the brightness on the screen! Even though I was using night mode my eyes were absolutely fried by the end and that's while I was wearing my blue light glasses!!

**After the Exam:**

* I walked out feeling pretty neutral; the difficulty level was exactly like the previous nbmes which wasn't so scary since I had gotten good scores on those even though I felt shitty writing them. Only thing is I wish I had spent more time on ethics- there was like 30-40% ethics in EACH BLOCK! Don't underestimate it! Do lots of practice questions!
* The next 2 weeks I didn't think of my results at all I thought they'd take around 3-4 weeks to come out, but suddenly I got an email from prometric saying my result was available and I HAD PASSED ü§Ø
* Overall I'd say don't fall for all the fearmongering on this subreddit- just look at your nbme scores objectively and don't be afraid to postpone if you think it'll boost your confidence!",9,1731140341.0,step1,0,1.0,False
