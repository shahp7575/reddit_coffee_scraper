The focal distance at it's greatest is roughly 152mm (6in). Some squirrels got curious and got playful and it started drooping under the weight and droop so it caused this interesting effect where the sun goes in front of the house. The light leak was because a squirrel chewed through the side of the lid. I'd love to get thoughts help taking cleaner photos!

Been going through a rocky patch in the relationship. I‚Äôve tried to get him to therapy but he refuses. And a few weeks back he said jokingly that he will work on the relationship if I give him a ‚Äúhall pass‚Äù while he‚Äôs on his trip with friends. Didn‚Äôt think much about it then. I had access to his Instagram. He changed his password a week before the trip and didn‚Äôt give me the password and I didn‚Äôt ask for it. But this felt weird and I correctly guessed the password and logged in on the first day of his trip. Saw message notification from an unknown person and opened it and figured she was the waitress at a bar he visited. He has followed her on Instagram and given her compliments and asked if she wanted to meet for coffee. And the next day he invited her to the hotel he was staying at and invited her for a coffee again. She declined saying she has a boyfriend. He deleted the chats immediately but I had seen the whole thing unfold. I felt deeply hurt and I couldn‚Äôt function. I‚Äôve been loyal to this person and to this relationship and I can‚Äôt imagine myself doing something like this.

They make mineral sticks for preparing brewing water at home. It's basically like Third Wave Water but based in Europe, which is cool because it's way cheaper and TWW shipments to Europe is ~50‚Ç¨.

However their website doesn't look very professional and I haven't found anything about them online, so I would like to know if any of you has ordered from them before and how was your experience.

I ordered some sticks a few days ago, but they haven't arrived yet. If anyone is interested I'll update this post when I have them with me!

English drug baron Rick McNicholl decides to capitalize on this and rake in the profits, laundering profits via British charities and English private schools.","In the not-too-distant future, a continent-wide food and coffee shortage sweeps most of Western Europe, including the British Isles and food imports and government bailouts fail to ease the unusual crisis.

During this time, the use of illicit drugs shoots up across the country - a country with a rich history of widespread farming, childhood gluttony and force-feeding, a strong food culture and fast food chains and grocery chains - especially amongst under-45s, as Brits attempt to ""weather the storm' and ""disract their brains from hunger pangs and depression"" and ""keep motivated and positive"".

English drug baron Rick McNicholl decides to capitalize on this and rake in the profits and then launders profits via charities, private schools and high street shops.

Whilst a few years ago the price per gram of Cocaine was between US$45 (‚Ç¨41) and US$85 (‚Ç¨78), street prices have now shot up to as high as US$250 (‚Ç¨220).

Armed with an abundance of cocaine, McNicholls enjoys extremely high sales in a market where demand is fast outstripping supply.

However, what McNicholls doesn't consider is the long-term impact his flooding of drugs will do to the country.

Despite warnings from his more ""cautious"" associates, McNicholls dismisses stories as ""scare tactics"" and insists that illicit drug epidemics depicted in Hollywood are ""completely unrealistic and over-the-top"".",0,1730577843.0,stories,0,0.5,False

Same ratio 1:16.5. I used 20.1 grams of Granja Paraiso 92 from Moonwake. I used u/empiricalwater in both. 1:3 bloom at 45 sec, 5 pulses with 30 sec between. I think I set the flow rate at 5ml/sec. (But I'll have to double check that when I get home)

The Aiden took about 1 and a half to 2 minutes to program. Super easy and intuitive. The Gevi took me over 10 minutes to program. Actually gave up trying to program it from scratch and just modified a similar recipe I had put in a few days ago. 

I ground both using the grinder on the Gevi. I was going to use my DF64ii but I had already programmed the gevi for whole beans and didn't want to start the programming over to start from ground beans. Both set at 96c.

The coffee:

 The smell of the coffee from the Aiden was the hands down winner. The aroma of sweet peaches just filled the cup.

 The coffee was quite a bit darker from the Aiden

 The taste from the Gevi was sweet and smooth and clear. No bitterness or sour notes. A beautifully made coffee. The Aiden was a bit over extracted. The first sip started off with lots of milky peaches, almost peach pie. But was quickly taken over by an overwhelming bitterness. 

As much as I hate programming the Gevi, the cup it made was way more enjoyable. 

I'm going to try to dial in the Aiden to get a similar cup. Maybe go a little coarser or a little cooler. Should be easy enough to change those parameters on the Aiden. But if the results were reversed,  I'm not sure if would spend the time trying to get equal results from the Gevi.",1,1730577754.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

To my right was a fresh pile of puke and a guy smoking. As I walked the two blocks to the subway station a lady with a raspy voice asks, ""Hey buddy, have a dollar?"" I respond with ""Sorry."" and she replies with ""Liar!""



I make it to the subway station and some idiot is standing right in front, blocking the entrance while chatting on his cell. A loud ""excuse me"" gets him to move.



As I walk down the steps, I look to my right and notice a large pile of HUMAN SHIT. I glance away in horror.



I approach the turnstile, a lady is blocking it (standing in the turnstile) while looking through her purse for a subway card. The other turnstiles are being used by people exiting.



Once I get through and down the stairs the subway pulls away from me. I actually watch the doors close in my face as I dash for it. I wait another 10 mins and the next train comes. I walk in and notice a bum with his socks and shoes off PICKING AT HIS TOES! The smell in unbearable! I rush to try and get to the next car, but can't make it. So I'm stuck for a stop in a bum-feet filled train car. The lady next to me is gagging at the smell.



I switch cars at the next station only to come across a bunch of stomping kids doing back flips while yelling ""DONATION! DONATION! DONATION!""



I make it to my destination station and as I get to the sidewalk a chubby guy walking in front of me starts SNORTING, like shaking the ground snorting. He proceeds to hack shit all over the place and finishes with a few farmer blows.



As I approach the intersection, The light turns green for the cars to go. No more than a split second goes by and all the cars on the block begin to LAY ON THEIR HORN. Take note that the car at the front hasn't even had a millisecond to raise his foot off the brake pad.



After crossing the street I pass a staircase that REEKS of human PISS. As I look down, I notice the trails of dried piss passing under my feet. The smell stings my nose.



I get to my office and grab a cup of coffee from the break room.

1gi4wux,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1gi4wux/the_alien_detective_agency_part_0_welcome_to_the/,The Alien Detective Agency: Part 0- Welcome To The Weird,"**This is a story that I originally conceived as a Teen. For the fans of Doctor Who, The X Files, Sarah Jane Adventures, Mona The Vampire, and anyone who loves young adult fiction. This is a very British tale of Teenagers helping aliens in the small fictional town of Brindley, in West Lancashire:**

My name is Trinity Jones. I am 14 years old, I go to West Bank Secondary School, and live with my Mother and Stepfather Ryan. Dad lives in Scotland with his wife Kirsty, and the Baby, Roag. I like to sing, and I watch old episodes of Murder She Wrote with my Grandad. Life was pretty boring here in Brindley. At least until a couple of weeks ago.

I spend Wednesdays at Choir practice with 13 other kids, and Miss Loeb, the Music Teacher. Nice woman, smells a bit like Coffee, always wearing a long floral skirt and creme cardigan. As we were getting to the end of practice, singing Katy Perry's Firework, a text from Mum set into a motion a chain of events:

Mum: Hi Trin, stuck at the Hospital for a meeting. Won't be able to pick you up x

Me: No Probzz x

It was a probzz, but Mum has had a lot on at work recently, so I let it slide. As a compensation, she gave me ¬£7 to go to Donna's for a kebab and some fries, so not all bad. I left school with Jess, my best friend, who always seems to have a new problem everytime I speak to her:

*'...And Ryan is still Snapping her, and still liking her TikToks. I don't get it, she's a sucky person. She can suck lemons like she sucks-'*

*'JESS'*¬†I laughed¬†*'You can't say that'*. Jess' scrunched face and pouted lips suggested that she wasn't too happy with her brother's Tik Toking habits. I won't lie, she had a point about Indyah D'amica, the poutiest girl in Year 11, but her and Ryan are 2 years above us, and while I would love for him to like my TikToks, I know he probably won't.

*'Yeah, well, I just don't like her is all. Anyways, got to get home. Dad's making Lamb chops tonight, and I would not like to miss out'.*¬†Jess quickly said, hugging me, and parting ways. Donna's was just down the road anyway, but it looked strangely abandoned. The lights were on, the door was open, but no one was inside. Full of a morbid curiosity, and love of putting myself in dangerous situations, I found myself compelled to go inside, and see why it was empty. As I entered, the various week old glossy magazines, newspapers, and other things I see on my Breakfast table were strewn across the floor. The fryer was still on, and food was left on the counter, with a single Can of Miranda rolling on the floor. I look over the counter, and I see it. It was horrifying.

A toddler sized, brown creature sitting on the floor. It's oversized belly filled with curry sauce, grabbed from one of the partially empty tubs on the kitchen floor. Its head turned 180 degrees, and two illuminated eyes gazed at me. Its face was covered in a canvas of blue bubblegum soda, yellow curry sauce, and white mayonaise. I stood there froze, as the creature pointed at me and screamed, standing on its feet, and jumping on the counter, yelling, and getting its sharp, thick, black talons protruded to slash at me. I found then that my hand was grabbed from behind, and I was suddenly pulled out of the store by a lad from school:

*'Terry?'*¬†I shouted.

It was Terry. The weird kid in Year 10. He was not wearing his blazer or tie, but he was wearing his usual black trenchcoat. His messed up mousy hair was crudely put into a quiff, as he reached for his spectacles.

*'Hi, Trinity. What's up'*¬†he asked me, non chalantly.

*'I...well...yeah...THERE IS A BABY SIZED ALIEN IN DONNA'S'*¬†I replied, struggling to even get a sentence out of my mouth.

*'No. That's not a baby sized alien. But it is a Baby Charmiloid, from the Planet Kevlar IX'*¬†he calmly smiled, as my eyes bulged as much as the alien that nearly tried to eat my face¬†*'They're not harmless, but worst she would've done is scratch you. Her Mum left her when their disguise was malfunctioning. Do us a favour, when I go in, shut the door, and keep it shut?'*

That request sent me back into reality¬†*'No, Terry. I am not letting you do that! IT IS EVIL'*¬†I pleaded, as I didn't know what a baby Charizard...Charziboid...whatever it was was. However, Terry was confident that he could do it, so I reluctantly joined in. I had my back turned as I kept the door shut. I could hear the clang of metal, a few swear words, and food being thrown against the window. I then heard a knock at the door, as Terry reappaeared, hair messier than before, scratch on his hand, and a little girl smiling, holding a lollipop, and wearing a teddy bear Onesie.

*'What just happened?'*¬†I asked meekly.

Terry explained, once again in that calm, and relaxed manner he had¬†*'Her Mum called us to get her home safely. She probably scared off the rest of Donna's staff. Don't worry, they're all fine, just getting their minds wiped'.*¬†Terry then asked if I wanted to walk the girl to her home, and I, again, meekly replied yes.

We then walked 10 minutes up the road, and Terry took the girl home, and handed the Mother a ticket. He then walked up the path, and we started walking home. The walk was silent, only interrupted by my attempts at awkward small talk. As we approached my house, Terry spoke again:

*'Well, Trin'*¬†he said, before I interrupted him

*'Don't call me Trin'*¬†I frowned.

*'Sorry, Trinity. But I have to say you did really well then'*¬†he said, smiling that bright, clueless smile.

*'Oh...Thank you?'*¬†I answered bemused, half expecting to be zapped by a Men in Black memory pen.

Terry became serious, his smile turned into a solumn stare, as he was delivering an important announcement:¬†*'Yeah. In fact, I want to make you an offer. Now you know that Aliens are, well, here, you have the option of getting your memory wiped, or joining us'*

*'Us?'*¬†I asked puzzled\*. 'Who else knows about...this?'\*

*'I am part of the Alien Detective Agency. A secret group of Teens and Adults who investigate crimes, incidents, and the many mysteries involving alien life. You have what it takes to join us. I saw you go into Donna's, and I saw that you didn't run from the Charmaloid. We need you.'*

And like that, my world shattered. Everything I ever knew or will ever know changed right at that second. An hour ago, I was listening to my best friend moan about her Brother not being with me. And now? There's so much more. I can be more. I looked Terry straight in the eye, and I uttered one word that would cement this change forever:

I am 14 years old, I go to West Bank Secondary School, and live with my Mother and Stepfather Ryan. Dad lives in Scotland with his wife Kirsty, and the Baby, Roag. I like to sing, and I watch old episodes of Murder She Wrote with my Grandad. Life was pretty boring here in Brindley. At least until a couple of weeks ago. 

I spend Wednesdays at Choir practice with 13 other kids, and Miss Loeb, the Music Teacher. Nice woman, smells a bit like Coffee, always wearing a long floral skirt and creme cardigan. As we were getting to the end of practice, singing Katy Perry's Firework, a text from Mum set into a motion a chain of events:

Mum: Hi Trin, stuck at the Hospital for a meeting. Won't be able to pick you up x

Me: No Probzz x

It was a probzz, but Mum has had a lot on at work recently, so I let it slide. As a compensation, she gave me ¬£7 to go to Donna's for a kebab and some fries, so not all bad. I left school with Jess, my best friend, who always seems to have a new problem everytime I speak to her:

*'...And Ryan is still Snapping her, and still liking her TikToks. I don't get it, she's a sucky person. She can suck lemons like she sucks-'* 

*'JESS'* I laughed *'You can't say that'*. Jess' scrunched face and pouted lips suggested that she wasn't too happy with her brother's Tik Toking habits. I won't lie, she had a point about Indyah D'amica, the poutiest girl in Year 11, but her and Ryan are 2 years above us, and while I would love for him to like my TikToks, I know he probably won't. 

*'Yeah, well, I just don't like her is all. Anyways, got to get home. Dad's making Lamb chops tonight, and I would not like to miss out'.* Jess quickly said, hugging me, and parting ways. Donna's was just down the road anyway, but it looked strangely abandoned. The lights were on, the door was open, but no one was inside. Full of a morbid curiosity, and love of putting myself in dangerous situations, I found myself compelled to go inside, and see why it was empty. As I entered, the various week old glossy magazines, newspapers, and other things I see on my Breakfast table were strewn across the floor. The fryer was still on, and food was left on the counter, with a single Can of Miranda rolling on the floor. I look over the counter, and I see it. It was horrifying.

A toddler sized, brown creature sitting on the floor. It's oversized belly filled with curry sauce, grabbed from one of the partially empty tubs on the kitchen floor. Its head turned 180 degrees, and two illuminated eyes gazed at me. Its face was covered in a canvas of blue bubblegum soda, yellow curry sauce, and white mayonaise. I stood there froze, as the creature pointed at me and screamed, standing on its feet, and jumping on the counter, yelling, and getting its sharp, thick, black talons protruded to slash at me. I found then that my hand was grabbed from behind, and I was suddenly pulled out of the store by a lad from school:

*'Terry?'* I shouted.

It was Terry. The weird kid in Year 10. He was not wearing his blazer or tie, but he was wearing his usual black trenchcoat. His messed up mousy hair was crudely put into a quiff, as he reached for his spectacles.

*'Hi, Trinity. What's up'* he asked me, non chalantly.

*'I...well...yeah...THERE IS A BABY SIZED ALIEN IN DONNA'S'* I replied, struggling to even get a sentence out of my mouth.

*'No. That's not a baby sized alien. But it is a Baby Charmiloid, from the Planet Kevlar IX'* he calmly smiled, as my eyes bulged as much as the alien that nearly tried to eat my face *'They're not harmless, but worst she would've done is scratch you. Her Mum left her when their disguise was malfunctioning. Do us a favour, when I go in, shut the door, and keep it shut?'*

That request sent me back into reality *'No, Terry. I am not letting you do that! IT IS EVIL'* I pleaded, as I didn't know what a baby Charizard...Charziboid...whatever it was was. However, Terry was confident that he could do it, so I reluctantly joined in. I had my back turned as I kept the door shut. I could hear the clang of metal, a few swear words, and food being thrown against the window. I then heard a knock at the door, as Terry reappaeared, hair messier than before, scratch on his hand, and a little girl smiling, holding a lollipop, and wearing a teddy bear Onesie. 

*'What just happened?'* I asked meekly. 

Terry explained, once again in that calm, and relaxed manner he had *'Her Mum called us to get her home safely. She probably scared off the rest of Donna's staff. Don't worry, they're all fine, just getting their minds wiped'.* Terry then asked if I wanted to walk the girl to her home, and I, again, meekly replied yes. 

We then walked 10 minutes up the road, and Terry took the girl home, and handed the Mother a ticket. He then walked up the path, and we started walking home. The walk was silent, only interrupted by my attempts at awkward small talk. As we approached my house, Terry spoke again:

*'Well, Trin'* he said, before I interrupted him

*'Don't call me Trin'* I frowned.

*'Sorry, Trinity. But I have to say you did really well then'* he said, smiling that bright, clueless smile.

*'Oh...Thank you?'* I answered bemused, half expecting to be zapped by a Men in Black memory pen.

Terry became serious, his smile turned into a solumn stare, as he was delivering an important announcement: *'Yeah. In fact, I want to make you an offer. Now you know that Aliens are, well, here, you have the option of getting your memory wiped, or joining us'*

*'Us?'* I asked puzzled*. 'Who else knows about...this?'*

*'I am part of the Alien Detective Agency. A secret group of Teens and Adults who investigate crimes, incidents, and the many mysteries involving alien life. You have what it takes to join us. I saw you go into Donna's, and I saw that you didn't run from the Charmaloid. We need you.'*

And like that, my world shattered. Everything I ever knew or will ever know changed right at that second. An hour ago, I was listening to my best friend moan about her Brother not being with me. And now? There's so much more. I can be more. I looked Terry straight in the eye, and I uttered one word that would cement this change forever:

1gi4r4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gi4r4l/faceless_mary/,Faceless Mary,"Hey nosleep. I‚Äôm Trish, I‚Äôve lurked on this subreddit for a while now, reading everyone‚Äôs experiences and what not. I always was skeptical of them, until about a month ago. I‚Äôm in high school, junior year to be exact, and at homecoming something happened.

My best friend, Mary, was always a bit of a recluse. Even when we were five she would fake being sick just to stay at my house for the day. Even after our parents stopped talking to each other my dad would always let her stay the night despite his own issues with her parents. I never knew what happened between them, I don‚Äôt think I ever will after what happened.

Mary liked to prank people, a lot. She got in trouble with so many of our teachers because of her pranks. I remember this one day in our freshman year, she was pitching a scheme to me. She wanted to glitter bomb our homeroom teacher, ended up suspended for a day because of it.

I think that fueled her pranks, honestly I wish it never did. I wish she just stopped. I wish she didn‚Äôt get worse. She kept pranking our teachers, kept getting suspended and getting detentions. It got worse. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it when it happened, I was like a frog in a slowly boiling pot. I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was until it was too late. How could I?

She stuck to her glitter bombs for a long time, it was harmless minus the mess. No one would think anything of it. I certainly didn‚Äôt. When she started taking interest in those more advanced glitter bombs I didn‚Äôt care. It was just glitter. In our sophomore year she started taking a mechanics class.

She was so excited about it. She‚Äôd rush to my house after school each day and have me make things with her. I didn‚Äôt fully get all of it, but Mary was so happy. Even when she started bringing car parts over I didn‚Äôt think anything of it.

One time she came over and slammed this car engine onto the coffee table, I nearly fell out of the couch at the slamming noise.

‚ÄúBe careful, that‚Äôs an old table!‚Äù My dad called from the kitchen. He always avoided her when she came over.

‚ÄúSorry, Mr. Davidson!‚Äù Mary called back, before whipping her head over to me. She blew some of her black hair out of her face, smiling wide. ‚ÄúGuess how much I got this for!‚Äù

I sighed, moving to stand up. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a dump right by your house, I know you got it from there.‚Äù

‚ÄúActually that closed, dangerous conditions or something I don‚Äôt know. Nah, Mrs. Forrest gave it to me!‚Äù Mary said. ‚ÄúCompletely free of charge. She phrased it as a school project, but apparently it‚Äôs not exactly for a grade.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot exactly?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe phrased it weirdly.‚Äù Mary shrugs.

‚ÄúAh. So what do you need to do to it?‚Äù I asked.

Mary beamed. ‚ÄúClean it out, get rid of some dents and the rust.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound fun.‚Äù I point out

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt make it fun.‚Äù Mary retorted

I shrugged, not knowing how to reply to that. For the rest of the day Mary and I worked at it until she had to head home. I never liked working at car parts, but she loved it. Mary always loved the mechanical aspect of things. Maybe she should‚Äôve been a suspect when things first started to happen.

Mrs. Forrest, Mary‚Äôs mechanics teacher, ended up hospitalized three months later. I never learned too many of the details, but I remember when the cops came to my door. They asked me if I knew her, knew anyone who had a grudge against her in her class, all of that. Apparently a fuse blew while she was grading a project, and she couldn‚Äôt remember which one went off.

Everyone knew it was some sort of foul play, but no one knew who it was. I never suspected Mary, and maybe it never was her, but everything else lined up so well. She just seemed so worried. She was my best friend, how could I suspect her? Why would I? Surely the police would figure it out and make an arrest, but they never did.

More incidents occurred, all to teachers. Mrs. Forrest was the only one who taught Mary, but all of them had a similar case. Something blew in their house, and their face became heavily scarred as a result.

After the fourth incident, Mary started acting weird. She became fixated on her face. Whenever she came over she‚Äôd pick and scratch at it. Her face became red and raw. My dad started to buy her face creams, and he even considered talking to her parents. I didn‚Äôt know why he worried so much. I didn‚Äôt know why then.

Once the school year ended, the incidents stopped. Mary became more aggressive to other students in our year, but never to me. Then junior year began. It was going to be our first year having a prom. We were gonna go together, as we always did with homecoming.

Even then, we still treated homecoming as serious as we could. We went dress shopping where we always did. It was this small store owned by Ms. Ellen and her grandkids. Ms. Ellen would always make the most intricate dresses, and we loved them.

We were looking through the store, every year Ms. Ellen would make something new and we were excited to see what it was. This time all of her dresses had some sort of bow motif. Mary found a sleeveless red dress with a large frilly skirt, the waist was wrapped with a black ribbon with a bow in the back. It was beautiful, and Mary looked beautiful in it when she tried it on. I ended up with a blue dress, it was the same design as Mary‚Äôs, but with a white ribbon instead.

Mary seemed blank that day, staring into space almost every minute. I wasn‚Äôt bothered, she always spaced out. Yet this was different. It was longer, and she seemed focused on whatever she was staring at. Once I saw her moving her jaw up and down, almost like a dummy being puppeteered to talk.

It was creepy, but maybe it was nothing. I ignored it. I ignored every sign until it was too late, until homecoming came and I saw what she became. Maybe if I noticed sooner, maybe if I said something, maybe she‚Äôd be ok.

Homecoming was the same as always, at first. I got there before Mary, sticking by the food table as I waited for her. Music was going, and it covered up the squeaking of shoes on the gym floor. It was dark, only being lit up with colored spot lights.

I was focused on the doors, and soon enough they opened. Into the gym stepped Mary. She was completely barefoot, dirt and grass sticking to her feet, her hair was barely brushed, draping down her masked face, yet her dress was perfect, having no stains or tears. It was almost like a doll you played with too much.

For some reason, I didn‚Äôt walk over to her. My feet were glued to the ground. She slowly moved her hand to her face, her fingernails looked sharp and like they were stained with something. Mary carefully removed her mask, hair falling to the side.

She didn‚Äôt have a face. It wasn‚Äôt there. I mean it was there but it just wasn‚Äôt. Instead of the red and raw skin, there wasn‚Äôt any skin at all. Instead rough, patchy, bleeding flesh. She tore off her own face.

A chaperone quickly went to check on her, while another took out his phone to presumably call an ambulance. Before the chaperone approaching her could even get a word out, Mary lunged at her. She was like an animal, tearing at the screaming chaperones face.

The homecoming turned to chaos. Some braver students attempted to shove Mary away, only to get stabbed by the knife she wielded. I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt notice it at first. Many ran, the chaperone calling 911 got through. I‚Äôm still convinced that‚Äôs why so many survived. I doubt we would have without him. Mary got off of the chaperone she had mauled, and began to charge at whoever she could. She stabbed, she tore, she fought. Mary was like an animal. I didn‚Äôt run like so many others. No one tried to get me.

Soon enough, Mary and I were the only breathing things in that room. Bodies littered the ground, their faces all bloodied or gone. Mary limped forward towards me, I guess someone got a lucky hit. She tilted her head, hazel eyes shining in the remaining lights.

I finally managed to convince my body to cooperate, taking a step backwards. ‚ÄúMary..?‚Äù I began slowly.

She let out an animalistic grunt, the muscles around her eyes contracting in what I could only assume was a smile.

For some reason, she didn‚Äôt seem like a threat to me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I was terrified, but I just knew she wouldn‚Äôt hurt me. Somehow I knew. I didn‚Äôt step closer, I wasn‚Äôt stupid, but when she got right in my face I didn‚Äôt step away.

She reached a hand up to my hair, tracing through it. Her fingers twirled through the blonde and her muscles contracted in that smile. Her fingers were sharp, almost like claws. I‚Äôm not sure what happened, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever know what happened.

When the sirens approached, Mary jerked away from me and ran. Police rushed into the gym, and when they saw me as the only living thing there they took me away and wrapped me in a shock blanket. It wasn‚Äôt cold, but the heavy and uncomfortable fabric soothed me. I told the police what I saw, and when the other survivors confirmed the story the police got off my back.

They‚Äôre still looking for Mary, and even if they haven‚Äôt found her it‚Äôs only been a month. We all know she‚Äôs still out there. They would have more answers, but when the police went to her parents house they found their fate. According to the police there were symbols tattooed on their backs.

I know my dad knows something about it, but he won‚Äôt tell me anything. He says it‚Äôs not worth it. He says Mary‚Äôs gone now. I know she‚Äôs not. I know she‚Äôs still out there, still in this neighborhood, still lurking. I know she won‚Äôt hurt me, but anyone could be next. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I still care about Mary, and I know she cares about me but I can‚Äôt just go after her can I?

I‚Äôm scared, I just want my friend back. How am I supposed to go back to school? How am I meant to recover?

I don‚Äôt know. Everything went away, everything I cared about left me and my dad doesn‚Äôt even care enough to tell me what he knows.",1,1730576976.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

After 10pm most nights, do you ever find yourself nodding off to sleep for seconds at a time? I DON'T mean while watching TV on the couch, but during conversation and especially mid-sentence. I've been struggling with this off and on since 2020 and my friends say that it's not normal, no matter how tired I might be. Plus, it's during conversations with my best friend, so it's not like I'm bored to death. 

I thought it was a processing-COVID thing, but I also have been doing a lot of inner work since then and am wondering if this is my body's newest way of narcotization. My life isn't going how I want rn so I assume it's psychosomatic. Of course, it could also be straight-up health related and be some kind of mild narcolepsy, I guess lol. I've been doing coffee or monster at night to self-medicate, so I'd like to get to the bottom of it. Thanks in advance!",1,1730576895.0,EnneagramType9,0,1.0,False
1gi4py6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1gi4py6/burnout_vyvanse_having_to_relearn_how_to_say_no/,"Burnout, Vyvanse, & Having to Re-Learn How to Say No","Can anyone help me relearn how to have boundaries with colleagues who want to be friends when I don't, to protect my wellbeing in recovery from probably autistic burnout and/or chronic fatigue? Scripts would be especially helpful!

It's a long one, no worries if long ones aren't for you today or ever, some days they aren't for me too.

I thought I had learned how to Say No as an adult after growing up as a people pleaser with no boundaries. Not expertly, but decently enough, you know? For a couple years this woman at work seemed on a mission to MAKE us become friends and I kept flatly turning down her every suggestion to hang out no matter how awkward it got. She reminds me of my younger self (though she's a littleolder than me) - desperately seeking approval, oblivious to all boundaries unless brutally explicitly stated. Weirdly now it's like I can't even remember the words I used to say no to her before or how I made myself feel okay about it.

How have I suddenly gone backwards, you ask? 

The things that's changed is I got an ADHD dx and started Vyvanse a month ago. Now when I'm in the drug's active window (most of my work day) I feel pretty peppy and can-do. And now when this woman asks me to get lunch or whatever (because she NEVER STOPPED TRYING), I just say yes? And I kinda feel fine about doing it at the time, it's like ""Oh this isn't so bad actually, for sure I'd rather be researching my latest hyperfocus or catching up on messages with actual real friends, but this is fine I guess"". But the crash I get in the evening when the Vyvanse wears off is real hard, my energy and mood plummet off a cliff and I feel like my soul has been sucked out through my nostrils. When not medicated, I'm still REALLY not doing okay. 

I think the Vyvanse masks my symptoms of autistic burnout and chronic fatigue during the day, but those conditions are still there and I still need to take care of myself by limiting my exposure to surface level social interactions and other sensory simulations that drain me, even if I don't feel drained in the moment.

I'm only now realising that I have always relied on that pit-of-the-stomach feeling of UTTER DOOM, GOD I FEEL LIKE I WILL DIE IF I SAY YES TO THAT to give me permission/impetus to say No to people. That's eye opening to realise and I see two problems with it straight away. 

Immediate problem: I don't get that feeling of wrung-out dread on Vyvanse so I've gone right back to saying Yes by default like there's no other choice, and it's worsening my burnout/fatigue.

Wider problem: Realising I have ALWAYS had to be in burnout or fatigue flareup already before I feel like it's okay to say no to things! That's not taking care of myself well enough and I want and need to up my game in this department.

I would love suggestions and scripts to shut down the following scenarios, bearing in mind I HAVE been thoughtlessly and foolishly saying yes recently and now she thinks she Finally Made It and were totally friends now, so I feel extra guilty about going back to No Thank You! 

- ""Hey do you you want to get coffee together at lunch tomorrow?""

- ""What's the gossip, tell me what's going on in your life! Tell me something about you I don't know!""

- Finding something to ask me about literally every time I have to pass her desk to collect something off the printer. Sometimes personal, sometimes work-related but just a curiosity like ""why does this software do X this way?"" I never mind giving help when actually needed, like when it's crucial enough that she comes to my room to ask for it, but this feels more like opportunistic grabbing at any opportunity to interact and I am super, SUPER just here to do my job and get paid like the autistic mofo I am.  

- Asking about my plans and asking for more details about those plans, and then asking afterwards how they went and for more details. I feel kinda crazy about this one, it feels normal and like I'm the one being crazy for hating it. I have a hobby I do on Tuesdays and literally EVERY Tuesday it's 'Are you going to X tonight? What will you do there this time?' and EVERY Wednesday it's a cross-examination for every detail of what I did at my club and I know this is just how people try to make each other feel cared about but I feel so monitored and invaded and icky, am I nuts?

For reference I am English and even our NT folks are known for being a bit standoffish, and my colleague has lived in England 10+ years but grew up in Europe so there could be cultural clash in play as well as NT/ND clash. She is the only woman in our small workplace, I am nonbinary but nobody takes that seriously where we work so she sees me as the only other woman in the office and I think that's why I'm her ceaseless target for Girly Gossipy Friendship Stuff which I HATE both on a gender level and an autism level. I'm very sure she doesn't mean any harm and I don't think it's realistic or necessary to make all of it stop completely but I desperately need to: 

a) get the level of non-work related chatter down, and
b) get back to feeling like a person who is capable of saying no to this stuff so I don't feel so helplessly forever trapped in it out of the mandate to 'be polite' lest some unspecified and terrifying punishment come upon me. 

Thank you so much if you made it this far. I really appreciate any suggestions and scripts you can offer, or any solidarity stories of people struggling with anything similar. üíö",1,1730576883.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False
1gi4p65,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/1gi4p65/vote_no_on_judge_hilton/,VOTE NO ON JUDGE HILTON!!!,"TLDR= VOTE NO, he is unhinged, erratic and dangerous. Greiten‚Äôs appointed Judge Hilton repeatedly makes decisions and rulings that are so sick and crazy letting perpetrators and people who murder innocent teens and toddlers out on bond. I‚Äôm only including in this post what can be substantiated, there are plenty more stories that back this sick behavior up. I know this is long- but this much craziness has been reported in the news in the last 5 years. 

HERE IS BASICALLY A SCRIPT OF A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JUDGE HILTON‚ÄôS SICK COURTROOM. HORRIBLE TO VICTIMS, THEIR FAMILIES AND THE DISABILITY RIGHTS COMMUNITY. 

* MISSOURI FAMILY AND DISABILITY ADVOCATES OUTRAGED AFTER MAN WHO ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY ABUSING A STUDENT WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IS ALLOWED TO POST BOND AFTER JUDGE HILTON  IN THE PRIOR HEARING SAID HE WOULD NOT LET HIM OUT ON BOND, MULTIPLE ADULTS WERE FIRST HAND WITNESSES TO THE MOLESTATION. Judge Bruce Hilton originally ordered Smith be held without bond when he was first charged, but then reversed course and allowed him to post his family‚Äôs property as a $250,000 bond. At the first hearing he said  ‚ÄúI believe the bond amount is high enough that I don‚Äôt believe that he will be able to secure a $250,000 cash-only bond,‚Äù Hilton said.
Eight days later, JUDGE HILTON allowed Smith to post his family‚Äôs property as bond. The family‚Äôs attorney noted the form Hilton signed allowing Smith to post his family‚Äôs property as bond contained typed information about the property and said she didn‚Äôt know how it got there. Hilton said he wrote it, and offered no explanation as to why his order did not reflect what he said he would do in court. 

The victim's mother claimed at Smith's sentencing hearing that Smith tried to harass and intimidate her family into silence, according to the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.
The mother said Smith pleaded guilty not out of remorse, but ""because all these cruel tactics and tricks did not work as he had hoped - and they did not silence or intimidate us.""

Prosecutors asked the judge to reprimand Carlson for serving the subpoenas, calling it ‚Äúnothing more than harassment,‚Äù and noting all of the witnesses had to miss work, arrange for childcare and should be reimbursed for mileage and attorney‚Äôs fee costs. *The judge asked prosecutors to put the complaints in writing.* 

The alleged victim‚Äôs father spoke in court, calling Smith, ‚Äúevery parent‚Äôs worst nightmare come true.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis was premeditated over months,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe infiltrated the classroom, the lunch table intentionally and targeted children with disabilities.‚Äù

The alleged victim‚Äôs father also told the judge he had gathered affidavits from all of the supporters who attended the hearing in April and heard the judge say Smith would get a $250,000 cash-only bond. Judge Hilton told the boy‚Äôs father:
‚ÄúThe next time you think you can send things to the court, you should talk with legal counsel,‚Äù Hilton said. ‚ÄúThis court will not be swayed.‚Äù
Hilton then denied the motion to reconsider the bond, allowing Smith to remain free on bond.

Hilton admonished the victim‚Äôs supporters who packed the courtroom after his decision to allow Smith out on bond. Those supporters included members of the Down Syndrome Association of St. Louis. ‚ÄúThis court will not be intimidated or influenced by outside sources,‚Äù Hilton said then (‚Äúoutside sources‚Äù???!!! The disability community supported a non- verbal child who there were adult eye- witnesses who reported it- this is the type of insanity that is Judge Hilton).

Smith sat in the gallery during the hearing and walked out of the courthouse with an ankle monitor when it was over.

St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell‚Äôs Office was disappointed in the judge‚Äôs decision, said Sam Alton, Bell‚Äôs Chief of Staff.
‚ÄúWe're unhappy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe strongly disagree with the court's ruling. We respect the court. We always do. But we strongly disagree with the ruling today.
‚ÄúIt seemed to us it was very clear that the court held that the defendant had to post $250,000 cash only, and that was the only way that the defendant was going to be released pending his trial.‚Äù

St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell‚Äôs Office then asked for a change of judge, which was granted.

In the end, with a new judge:
 A former Eureka High School custodian was sentenced to three years in prison Thursday after pleading guilty earlier this month to molesting a child with Down Syndrome.
Robert Smith pleaded guilty on April 9 to fourth-degree child molestation. He was originally charged in February 2022 with one count of first-degree sexual abuse after police said he molested the student over their clothing in a special needs classroom on Feb. 11. The hearing was attended by dozens of people in support of the victim, including members of the Down Syndrome Association.

*ROCKY HALE‚ÄôS MURDER:
Rocky Hale‚Äôs murder should not have happened. Azavian Royal was out on $100 bond for a handful of charges‚Äîamong them, felony escape from confinement, first-degree property damage, and armed robbery, at the time he shot and killed Rocky Hale.

According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Royal was arrested in December 2022 after he and two other inmates reportedly lured an employee of the St. Louis County Juvenile Detention Center into a restroom, attacked him, shattered a window, crawled out, jumped ‚Äú30 feet‚Äù to the ground, and made their escape. A few days later, Royal and an accomplice reportedly robbed a discount general store at gunpoint, leaving the scene‚Äîin ski masks, in the Midwest summer heat‚Äîabout $167 ‚Äúricher.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when Judge Hilton‚Äîover the objections of prosecutors in both the escape and robbery cases‚Äîgranted his release on $100 cash bond.
That‚Äôs not a misprint or a misplaced decimal.
That‚Äôs one ‚ÄúBenjamin‚Äù‚Äîbarely even enough for a one-month supply of ‚Äúventi skinny vanilla lattes‚Äù at the local coffee shop a block from Hilton‚Äôs third-floor courtroom.

As part of his conditions, Judge Bruce F. Hilton ordered Royal to stay with his mother, a St. Louis County jail guard who is charged with helping her son after the escape. He was also ordered to stay out of St. Louis city.

St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell said his office opposed both bond reductions ‚Äúbecause we believed and believe this defendant poses an immediate threat to our community.‚Äù

*WOMAN LINKED TO DEATHS OF 4 CHILDREN IN STL RELEASED ON BOND.
Judge Hilton approved the release of a woman linked to four child drug-related deaths since 2020, including one while she was out on bond in another case. Circuit Judge Bruce Hilton agreed to reduce the bond for Mary Anne Curtis, 30, of Jennings, who is charged in the death of a friend‚Äôs 17-month-old child who overdosed while in Curtis‚Äô care. That death came while Curtis was out on bond for charges stemming from the death of one of her three infant children who have died in the past three years because of drug exposure, according to prosecutors‚Äô statements in court.

Hilton agreed to reduce Curtis‚Äô bond from $1 million to personal recognizance, meaning she will not have to put up a cash deposit for her release. She will be under house arrest and will be required to wear a GPS monitor and undergo drug tests. Bond conditions also include a 9 p.m. curfew and a requirement that she stay away from children younger than 3.

St. Louis County assistant prosecutor John Schlesinger argued against the release.

‚ÄúShe has demonstrated time and time again she will not follow bond conditions,‚Äù Schlesinger told the judge. ‚ÄúShe broke all her bond orders last time, and another child died.‚Äù

Schlesinger said prosecutors fear she will put her unborn child at risk.

In court Judge Hilton said, ‚Äúif she trips up, she will be back,‚Äù telling her aunt that Curtis must stay off drugs while she‚Äôs out of jail. ‚ÄúShe needs to be clean, or she will kill this child.‚Äù 

Two of four deaths tied to Curtis over less than four years have led to charges.

January 2020: Curtis gave birth to twins who died within two days at a St. Louis hospital, according to arguments from St. Louis County prosecutors. At the time, Curtis told St. Louis police she had used drugs during the pregnancy and told them: ‚ÄúI had God take them. I‚Äôm not going to lie,‚Äù Schlesinger told Judge Hilton in an earlier hearing. She was never charged in those deaths.

Court documents allege the baby had enough methadone in his system to kill an adult. A toxicologist determined the baby ‚Äúwas purposely given methadone as there was too much methadone in his system to come from breastfeeding,‚Äù police wrote in court records.

Three weeks after Curtis was granted release for the charges connected to the death of her infant son, she was accused in yet another death, this time of a friend‚Äôs toddler.

Charges allege Curtis was tasked on March 20 with babysitting 17-month-old Brailey Stevenson for a few hours when the child overdosed in the 5600 block of Janet Avenue in Jennings. Brailey was pronounced dead at a hospital and tested positive for fentanyl and xylazine, a veterinary tranquilizer that‚Äôs not approved for human use but is increasingly mixed with fentanyl in the U.S.

Prosecutors said in court earlier this month that Curtis has given birth to a total of eight children. In addition to her three children who died drug-related deaths, another of her young children is in state care and will have lifelong developmental delays that state workers attribute to drug exposure, Schlesinger told the judge in a July hearing.

* CLAYTON HOMICIDE SUSPECT WAS OUT ON BOND BY HILTON. Less than two months before Trenell Johnson allegedly fatally shot a Clayton man earlier this week, a GPS company told Judge Hilton he had violated his GPS monitoring and it appears nothing was done about it.
According to a memo obtained by the I-Team, Community Services of Missouri, Inc. wrote: ‚ÄúDear Judge Hilton: please be advised that Mr. Johnson is no longer being monitored on GPS by this agency. His bracelet has not been charged and he will not return messages left by this agency‚Ä¶‚Äù Johnson was out on bail after police say in March, he fled from police in a stolen Kia, weaving in and out of traffic and into oncoming traffic. A police helicopter monitored the stolen car until it collided with a Metro Bus near Ferguson Avenue and St. Charles Rock Road. It then continued and struck a truck, which left the Kia inoperable, according to court documents. 
Johnson then ran away from the stolen car, and ""displayed a firearm in a threatening manner"" toward a detective who was chasing him. The detective was able to disarm Johnson and arrest him, according to court documents. 

Bell's office asked the judge for a $30,000 bail, ""because we are cracking down on these car theft cases because they have become a scourge in this community.""

Hilton reduced it, allowing Johnson to post $3,000 or 10%.

GAL, LAWYER, AND JUDGE HILTON COLLUSION REVEALED. This story is a little mangled, a lot of back story to all of this, but here‚Äôs the jist:
Judge Hilton‚Äôs time as a family court judge is just as disgusting. Multiple women have reported a targeted, sadistic behavior during their divorce process. 

In a divorce case, a Petitioner‚Äôs minor child disclosed to a therapist that she was molested by the Respondent, the girl in this custody made repeated disclosures of sexual abuse and Pudlowski demanded that the dad see her unsupervised over the objections of several therapists. A motion filed by the Petitioner‚Äôs attorney suggests widespread abuse in the case, particularly by the judge Bruce Hilton. Judge Bruce F. Hilton, who was the presiding Judge in this case, and had been allegedly accused of Bias, Prejudice, Harassment, Discrimination, Threats, Intimidation, Denigration and Hostile Acts, to name a few, toward Petitioner.

GAL-selected and Court-ordered therapist Evangeline Bauer witnessed Judge Hilton threatening Mom on March 12, 2018: ‚Äúkeep it up and I will take her from you. Get out of my courtroom.‚Äù‚Ä¶

Judge Bruce F. Hilton has in fact recused himself on January 12, 2021, with no explanation for his outrageous behavior, in a family court.

His best buddie Elaine Pudlowski, corrupt as hell, and well- documented he defends in regards to further legal trouble she got into in this case (maybe he could have displayed this level of kindness and consideration towards all of the families that are twice  victimized by his behavior, no he says this about a deplorable, corrupt GAL who so many have reported is a disgusting bottom- feeder in family courts and gets her kicks just like Judge Hilton off abusing their power and effing with peoples lives and stability.) Judge Hilton states in his recusal, ‚ÄúThis Court finds that Ms. Pudlowski has tirelessly served the Family Court of St. Louis County as a Court Appointed Guardian Ad Litem for over two decades with the utmost integrity, professionalism and in numerous instances without compensation.‚Äù

MARCELLUS WILLIAMS

Circuit Judge Bruce Hilton declined to throw out the conviction of Marcellus Williams, who was sentenced to death for the killing of Felicia Gayle.

‚ÄúThere is overwhelming evidence that Marcellus Williams‚Äô trial was constitutionally unfair,‚Äù said Tricia Rojo Bushnell, the organization‚Äôs executive director. ‚ÄúThere is still time for the courts or Governor Parson to ensure that Missouri does not commit the irreparable injustice of executing an innocent person.‚Äù

Bell gave arguments that Black people were stricken from the jury pool for racial reasons have been argued in past appeals. During one of the hearings the Prosecutor asked the judges to find that testimony from the trial prosecutor, Keith Larner, proved that race played a role in removing potential jurors. 

With its decision, the court rejected the effort by Williams‚Äô attorneys to obtain a stay of execution. Gov. Mike Parson issued a statement that he would not intervene in the case.

‚ÄúThere is no basis for a court to find that Williams is innocent, and no court has made such a finding,‚Äù Hilton wrote in his opinion. ‚ÄúWilliams is guilty of first-degree murder and has been sentenced to death.‚Äù

St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell, whose office filed the motion to vacate the conviction in January, said in a statement he was ‚Äúimmensely disappointed‚Äù in the ruling.

‚ÄúI believe that those who are convicted of committing crimes should be brought to justice. And, for something as consequential as the death penalty, the evidence must prove the defendant to be guilty without a shadow of a doubt,‚Äù Bell said. ‚ÄúThere are detailed and well-documented concerns regarding the integrity of Mr. Williams‚Äô conviction.‚Äù

Hilton agreed with Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey, writing that Williams did not present ‚Äúany evidence from which this court could find that the State destroyed potentially useful evidence in bad-faith, let alone clear and convincing evidence of the same.‚Äù

With its decision, the court rejected the effort by Williams‚Äô attorneys to obtain a stay of execution. Gov. Mike Parson issued a statement that he would not intervene in the case.

Side notes:

Knowing Judge Hilton and his immense toxic ego, he may have had it out for Wesley Bell for removing him from the molestation case and other statements Bell Publicly made. 
‚Äî///////‚Äî-

The much-anticipated trial of a discrimination lawsuit aimed at St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell has been delayed until next year ‚Äî well after Bell makes a run for Congress. he jury trial, originally set to begin Monday, has been rescheduled for Jan. 27, after a hearing Friday before St. Louis County Circuit Judge Bruce Hilton.

The case took on a harder edge in late March, when Hilton ordered a new deposition at which Bell would have to answer questions he had avoided in a previous deposition.

I don‚Äôt know much about this case, but I do know it sucks like hell to be held hostage in Judge Hilton‚Äôs court room and have your life be held in the hands of a monster.

For context I'm the head barista at a cafe/roastery that's quite well known for high end specialty coffee. I was until recently the most recent employee at the shop and am still the youngest (I think this might be relevant) so since everyone works really well together and everyone has high standards, I've taken more of a focus on quality control and making sure the shop is fully stocked with coffee and menus are up to date and such. 

So today I was working with our new hire who's a part time barista who has come in from a well respected cafe doing high volume every day (more volume then our cafe does), so she naturally has a good eye for improving work flow, this is great, I'm always looking for improvement in the shop! The problem is though that she has been a bit dismissive when I try to explain why we do things a certain way which has been a bit frustrating.

 The real issue that's been bothering me today was when I was trying to complete a task that I considered important enough for some customers to wait for me to complete before I serve them. In this case I expected either she finishes her task first and then serves or I finish mine then serve, but then she asks me to serve before I finish my task, which I did. After this she says that because I am the head barista and get paid more than her that she shouldn't be working harder than me and that I should take more responsibility. 

I'm willing to admit that in this case, whether or not I should have served before completing my task is a grey area but regardless I believe we were all working very hard and all of us pushed through a busy Saturday shift together. 
I guess what I really need advice on is if I need to clear up this situation and what I should say to her because I don't think any barista should be criticising a co-worker while on the bar. But a part of me really thinks she's right to say that because she has more experience than I do and I know she really cares a lot about making the shop run well. 

Also just going to throw in there that I hate confrontation and will only call out one of our baristas if it's private and fully warranted.

1gi4mw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackadder/comments/1gi4mw6/baldrick_family_a_hypothetical_article/,Baldrick family: a hypothetical article,"The Baldrick family is a British family best known for producing several servants to the prestigious aristocratic Blackadder family. Their relationship has effectively promised that whenever a Blackadder was alive, a Baldrick was likely serving them in some capacity.

Origins

Few pieces of historical evidence suggest a definitive origin point for the Blackadder family, yet the Baldrick lineage‚Äôs origins are much more certain. The Baldrick family themselves claim to be descended from a Robin Baldrick, a fifteenth century dung cleaner based in Chigwell, Essex, and that his son was squire to Prince Edmund, younger son of Richard of Shrewsbury. Historians have come to the universal conclusion that this claim is impossible, as Richard of Shrewsbury disappeared aged nine or ten in 1483. Like the Blackadders, the Baldricks are suspected by historians to have originated on the island of Great Britain or from abroad settlers.

Celtic theory

The first theory is that like the Blackadders they would serve, the Baldricks are of Celtic ancestry. Put forward as evidence for this is a Celtic named Bad Reek, a participant in the construction of Stonehenge. However, whether Bad Reek had lived at the same time as the Celtic Blackadder theory‚Äôs Edmun is unclear.

Roman theory

The second origin theory posits that the Baldricks are of Roman ancestry, having arrived on Great Britain in the mid first century CE. As evidence the Roman theorists state that records give mention of a legionary named Baldricus. If the theory is true, then Baldricus, an assistant to the centurion Edmundus Blackaddicus, is the first Baldrick known to have served or accompanied a Blackadder. However, the Celtic theorists point to the possibility that the two men were merely local conscripts into the Roman Empire‚Äôs forces in Britannia.

Middle Ages

Since the family legend of descent from Robin Baldrick is universally accepted to be false, no medieval Baldricks have ever been confirmed.

Tudor Era (1558-1603)

The Baldricks first made a confirmed appearance in historical record during the Elizabethan era, in the form of a servant to Edmund, Lord Blackadder. This Baldrick had been in the Blackadder family since 1532 but ‚Äúso [had] syphilis.‚Äù despite verbal disdain from his employer, was deeply loyal to him, even volunteering to serve as bridesmaid at Lord Blackadder‚Äôs ultimately cancelled wedding.

Stuart Era (1603-1714)

The only known Baldrick at this time is Baldrick Esq., a servant to Sir Edmund Blackadder during the English Civil War. Accepting the job of executing King Charles I (even though Sir Edmund was a Royalist), Baldrick planned to save the king by passing off a pumpkin as his severed head. This failed on account of the fact that the pumpkin was not convincing at all. Sir Edmund ultimately betrayed Baldrick by switching to the Parliamentarians at the very last minute to save his own life. Following the Restoration in 1660, the Baldricks reappear in English high society; in 1680, Lord Blackadder PC was tasked with overseeing Charles II‚Äôs fiftieth birthday celebrations. Lord Blackadder sarcastically declared that in the matter of Royal galas, more musical talent is demonstrated whenever his servant Baldrick farts.

Regency Era (1811-1820)

The Regency period saw the reemergence of the Baldrick line as Sodoff Baldrick, dogsbody to the Prince Regent‚Äôs butler Mr. E. Blackadder Esq. Sodoff‚Äôs uncle was a thespian who starred in the Scottish Play as the Scottish Lord‚Äôs codpiece for his fight scenes. Meanwhile, his cousin Bert Baldrick was Thomas Gainsborough‚Äôs butler‚Äôs dogsbody, and appearently boasted greater, almost uncharacteristic intelligence than Sodoff. Sodoff was noted for his carelessness, such as burning the dictionary of Samuel Johnson, and his use as a pawn to keep the Prince Regent on the Civil List when threatened for his outrageous spending on luxury socks. E. Blackadder is recorded as having died from interrupting a duel between his employer and the Duke of Wellington over the Prince making unsolicited advances upon the latter‚Äôs nieces.

Victorian Era (1837-1901)

Sodoff‚Äôs son, Mr. Baldrick, would come to work at the shop of Mr. Ebeneezer Blackadder, E. Blackadder Esquire‚Äôs son, by Christmas 1858. Unlike many Baldricks, Mr. Baldrick knew nothing short of kindness from his employer. However, come Christmas morning, Mr. Baldrick lamented the sudden change in character Ebeneezer had apparently underwent, from ‚Äúthe nicest man in England‚Äù to the cunning, manipulative, witty cynic for which his bloodline is better known.

Global Era (since 1901)

Mr. Baldrick‚Äôs grandson S. Baldrick would continue his family‚Äôs unfaltering fealty to the Blackadder family as a private serving as Captain Edmund Blackadder‚Äôs batman in the trenches of the Western Front of the First World War. By 1917, Private Baldrick‚Äôs cooking was reduced to less than favourable circumstances, on account of running out of coffee and sugar, and using mud and dandruff for these respectively. Baldrick nearly caused his superior to be executed for shooting a carrier pigeon by foolishly insisting ‚ÄúCaptain Blackadder did not shoot this delicious plump-breasted pigeon.‚Äù Private Baldrick presumably died charging across No Man‚Äôs Land, along with his colleagues Lt. St Barliegh, Captain Darling, and Captain Blackadder, however Captain Blackadder narrowly evaded the German attack via taking cover in the next trench.

On New Year‚Äôs Eve 1999, Captain Blackadder‚Äôs grandson Lord Edmund Blackadder plotted to trick his guests into ten thousand pounds each for one item he could fetch with a time machine Baldrick, his septic tank cleaner, built. When Lord Blackadder found it was an actual *working* time machine, the duo had to resolve history after getting Robin Hood killed, getting into a scuffle with William Shakespeare, and allowing Napoleon Bonaparte to win the Battle of Waterloo and conquer the United Kingdom. However, Lord Blackadder had another idea, a ‚Äúvery, very, very cunning plan,‚Äù and the two set off to change history for their own benefit; by Y2K, Lord Blackadder is the widely commended King Edmund III, and Baldrick is his puppet Prime Minister.

The only twenty-first century Baldrick known is one who was gardener to Sir Edmund Blackadder, Chief Executive Officer of Melchett, Darling & Darling Bank.

Beyond the Stars (?????)

In the Distant Future, a Blackadder is Grand Admiral of the navy of a civilization ruling the entire known universe. Baldrick reappears as Grand Admiral Blackadder‚Äôs slave. Whether Grand Admiral Blackadder‚Äôs rise as ruler of the universe elevates Baldrick‚Äôs status is anyone‚Äôs guess.",1,1730576657.0,blackadder,0,1.0,False

A week ago I had a little dizziness that got worse. I stayed home from work 3 days, not comfortable driving. Husband took me to only available doctor appointment within a week. After blood work doc messages me and says iron is a little low, take a supplement. Ok, which one?  How much?  She said 65mg with vit c. 

And nothing else. Even the bottle doesn't say to avoid advil or pepto or coffee. I've had my second dose today (every other day) and with a banana no crushing nausea. However...

I'm very dizzy in the morning. It gets better as the day goes on. Even as I write this after being up for 7 hours I'm still a little unsteady. It feels like being a teeny bit drunk?  Or maybe coming down from cold meds?  Really hard to explain and I do not like it. I have to work and I have to do errands!

Doctor was useless on any additional info. So I have many questions. 

Should I bulk up on high iron foods?  I don't want to overdo it and feel weird from too much of a vitamin (last year got close to vit d toxicity so I've learned)

How long should I do all this?  Should I have another blood test in 6 months?

What would cause this (according to reddit any one of thousands of possibilities)  I'm 43 female. I eat really healthy. Fruit, veggies and chicken every day. I'm not a super athlete. But I walk 5 to 8 miles at work 6 days a week. Periods are light. Been on the pill for 20ish years. 

When will I feel better?!  I can't drive in the morning and that's my only time to get stuff done. 

I really don't understand what most of this means yet as I just got this news a few days ago but pics of blood work included. I know it's not as bad as some....I'm just having a hard time understanding it all and what I need to do. Thank you for reading my small novel and any advice you may have for me.

Smoked at 225 to 170 internal; wrapped and kept going to 210, then let it sit there for a couple hours. My intention was to overcook it a bit so it would be fork tender.

I did forget to add beef broth and orange juice when wrapping.

Sliced into 1"" strips, and cubed the stubborn bits. Fried some bacon in a Dutch oven, then sauteed onions, peppers (bell and ripe jalapeno) and garlic in the bacon fat. Added brisket, 2 cans beans, 3 cans RoTel, 2 cans tomato sauce, and 1 can corn.

Added 2 bottles amber ale and 1/2 cup leftover coffee for liquid.

Seasoned with chili powder and paprika to taste. Added a little of my own chili powder (smoked, dried, and pulverized jalapenos, serranos, and poblanos) as well as a tablespoon of brown sugar.

Now it's simmering, already tastes delicious, and smells amazing.

1gi4e7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/awesomelinks/comments/1gi4e7p/the_beautiful_madness_how_coding_affects_your/,The Beautiful Madness: How Coding Affects Your Sanity,"Coding might be rewarding, but the cost on mental and physical well-being is high. Here‚Äôs a quick look at the toll it takes:

1. **Sleep and Insomnia** For developers, sleep is a luxury. Late-night coding sessions blur the lines between day and night, turning insomnia into a constant companion. Chronic sleep loss affects emotional control, making even simple questions feel irritating.
2. **Isolation and Social Disconnect** Hours spent coding often lead to isolation. Declining social invitations becomes routine, leaving coders fluent in code but struggling with small talk, worsening loneliness and mental health.
3. **Emotional Highs and Lows** Coding‚Äôs unpredictable challenges create emotional rollercoasters. The temporary thrill of solving a problem keeps developers hooked, despite the stress of unpredictable errors and setbacks.
4. **Mental Strain from Multitasking** Juggling multiple projects affects cognitive performance. Basic tasks slip, and even personal life becomes a forgotten background as deadlines loom.
5. **Impostor Syndrome** Despite achievements, many developers feel like frauds. Success seems like luck, while every setback feels like proof they don‚Äôt belong, intensifying self-doubt.
6. **Addiction to Coding** Coding offers a dopamine rush, similar to addiction. Many start coding not out of necessity but out of an inability to stop.
7. **Caffeine Dependency** Coffee fuels coding marathons but adds anxiety and restlessness, making true relaxation difficult to achieve.
8. **Existential Crisis** Coders regularly question their life choices, knowing their work may be obsolete in a few months, feeding existential dread.
9. **Physical Strain** Poor posture and endless screen time lead to physical strain, yet coders often prioritize code over health.

**Conclusion**  
Coding is a relentless mix of challenge and passion, driving developers to the edge of sanity. Despite the toll, the occasional breakthrough keeps them coming back.

How do I get past this? ,"I've recently found out that during a rough period for us my boyfriend's (together 2 and a half years) contact with his ex shifted to a level I'm not comfortable with.

I'm friends with my ex, he is friends with his. I text my ex maybe once every couple of weeks/months to check in, ask how the cat is, meet for a coffee once in a while. I am very open with it. He would check in with his ex once in a while too, a similar situation except she lives further away so less actual time together. 

During a recent rough patch he visited family to help out at their business where his ex also works. This resulted in him seeing her every day and shifted to him spending more time with her socially too, but also texting an uncomfortably large amount... Good morning texts, good night texts and chats throughout the day every day for hours and hours, walls of texts. Nothing overtly sexual or flirty, but some slightly uncomfortable texts and lots of closeness... kisses, miss you texts, texts where he says ""I know it's not the same, but I'm still here"" after he comes back home. 

It's also obvious from the texts they had a lot of one on one time in person together talking. 

I found out by reading his phone, which I know is really out of order and manipulative, I've held my hands up to that and feel terrible for doing it, but before he knew I read the texts he massively downplayed the amount of time he saw her and said he hardly text her at all.

I'm aware this is far from my finest behavior here

But he can't explain what that change in their communication meant to him, nor can he understand why I'm struggling to understand and get past it. He says he ""knows it looks bad"" but there was nothing in it, and ""it was just nice spending time with her"" he says ""I've explained it, but you're not hearing or not willing to hear it""

And let me tell you, it‚Äôs like living in a world where feelings are those awkward relatives you avoid at family gatherings. Here are 10 facts about alexithymia that are so unknown, even the emotions are confused about them!

1. **Emotional Blindfolds:**¬†People with alexithymia have a unique superpower‚Äîthey can walk into a room and NOT feel the awkward tension! It‚Äôs like wearing emotional blindfolds, but the downside? You still awkwardly wave at the emotional wallflower in the corner.
2. **The ""Feeling"" Dictionary:**¬†While everyone else is flipping through their emotional thesaurus, those with alexithymia are stuck on ‚ÄúHappy, Sad, Angry, and... uh, what‚Äôs that one with the puppy?‚Äù Their emotional range is basically ""It‚Äôs fine"" and ‚ÄúNot fine.‚Äù
3. **The Ultimate Chill Pill:**¬†If you‚Äôre ever in a high-stakes emotional situation, just call up your alexithymic friend! They‚Äôll be completely unfazed when you spill coffee on their favorite shirt‚Äîprobably because they didn‚Äôt realize they had a favorite shirt in the first place!
4. **Therapy Sessions Are a Rollercoaster:**¬†A therapist once asked an alexithymic to describe their feelings, and it turned into a game of ‚ÄúGuess Who?‚Äù Spoiler alert: all the feelings were hiding behind the couch.
5. **Award-Winning Misdirection:**¬†Ever tried to express your feelings? It‚Äôs like trying to explain a meme to your grandparents. ‚ÄúSo, you see, it‚Äôs funny because... wait, let me Google ‚Äòemotional expression‚Äô first!‚Äù
6. **Emotional GPS Malfunction:**¬†‚ÄúTurn left at sadness, then right at confusion. Recalculate route once you hit existential dread.‚Äù Navigating emotions is a bit like trying to get directions from a GPS that only speaks in riddles.
7. **Incredible Poker Faces:**¬†If poker was an emotion-based game, alexithymics would be champions. Their faces stay as blank as an unsaved Word document, making bluffing impossible... or is it?
8. **Group Texts Are a Minefield:**¬†‚ÄúHow‚Äôs everyone feeling?‚Äù Ah, the dreaded question! Cue the silence while everyone else shares their deep feelings, and the alexithymic replies with a simple, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm breathing.‚Äù
9. **Emotional Hangovers:**¬†You know that feeling when you‚Äôve laughed so hard you can‚Äôt breathe? Imagine never experiencing that because you can‚Äôt connect the dots between laughter and joy. It‚Äôs like being at a party where the music is great, but you forgot to bring your dance moves.
10. **The Ultimate Icebreaker:**¬†‚ÄúSo, tell me about your feelings‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†*Cue the tumbleweed.*¬†It‚Äôs the ultimate test of friendship! If they stick around after that question, they‚Äôre a keeper.

So, there you go! Next time you hear ‚Äúalexithymia,‚Äù just remember it‚Äôs not a fancy dessert, but it‚Äôs definitely a recipe for some hilarious misunderstandings! üç∞üíî

1gi47yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1gi47yn/my_experience_with_uvbrite_water_bottle_worth_it/,My Experience with UVBrite Water Bottle ‚Äì Worth It or Not?,"I recently got my hands on the **UVBrite Water Bottle**, and I‚Äôve been using it every day for about a month now. It‚Äôs one of those **self-cleaning water bottles** that uses **UV-C light** to kill germs and bacteria in your water, which seemed like a neat idea, especially since I‚Äôm always on the go. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been working out for me and whether I think it‚Äôs worth having around.

# Why I Wanted a UV Purifying Water Bottle

To start, I drink a lot of water, whether I‚Äôm at the gym, at work, or traveling. But I have a bit of a pet peeve about water that tastes or smells odd ‚Äì I always end up tossing out reusable bottles because they start smelling funky, even if I wash them regularly. When I heard about the UVBrite water bottle and the **UV-C purification technology**, it seemed like the perfect solution. Plus, the idea of being able to fill up my bottle from almost any source and have it purify the water for me? That was hard to resist.

I did some reading and found that **UV-C light** is already used in hospitals and even the International Space Station to disinfect surfaces and water. This made the tech feel reliable for something as important as the water I drink. What‚Äôs cool is that this light kills up to 99.99% of germs and bacteria in your water ‚Äì no added chemicals, no filter changes.

# First Impressions and How It Works

When my **UVBrite bottle** arrived, it looked sleek and felt sturdy. It‚Äôs a stainless-steel, double-walled bottle, which means it‚Äôs insulated. I‚Äôve found it keeps my drinks cold or hot for a good chunk of the day ‚Äì about 12 hours or more. The bottle has a simple one-button design. You just fill it up, press the button, and the UV-C light does its thing for a couple of minutes. There‚Äôs a cleaning indicator light, so you know when it‚Äôs working.

I didn‚Äôt expect much from the **self-cleaning feature** at first, but it‚Äôs surprisingly effective. Every six hours, the UVBrite automatically activates a cleaning cycle to help prevent bacteria buildup inside the bottle. This has been a big help for someone like me who‚Äôs prone to forgetting to wash their bottle regularly. I only have to give it a proper cleaning every few months.

[**Here‚Äôs a link if you‚Äôre interested in checking it out.**](https://www.elprsdnt.com/8SWM4W1/DCC1P68/?uid=38397&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# How Effective is the UV-C Light?

Now, I don‚Äôt have the tools to test for bacteria, so I can‚Äôt ‚Äúprove‚Äù that it‚Äôs eliminating 99.99% of germs. But I‚Äôve used this **UV-C water bottle** with tap water, fountain water, and even in places where the tap water usually tastes off. The water from the **UVBrite water bottle** tastes and smells fresh every time, which has definitely boosted my confidence in it.

The **self-cleaning water bottle** feature alone has been a game-changer. In past bottles, I‚Äôd always notice a weird smell or metallic taste after a while. With the UVBrite, there‚Äôs none of that, even if I leave water in the bottle overnight or for a couple of days. It‚Äôs like having a fresh bottle every time I take a drink.

# Pros and Cons

# Pros

1. **Self-Cleans Every 6 Hours** ‚Äì This keeps it fresh without a lot of maintenance.
2. **Good Insulation** ‚Äì I like that it keeps my drinks cold during the day and hot for my coffee in the mornings.
3. **Portable and Rechargeable** ‚Äì It‚Äôs a bit heavier than regular plastic bottles, but it feels durable. Plus, I can take it anywhere since it only needs a recharge about once a month (and I use it a lot).
4. **Eco-Friendly** ‚Äì By now, I would have used at least 100 plastic bottles if I wasn‚Äôt using the UVBrite. It feels good knowing I‚Äôm reducing waste.

[**Here‚Äôs another link if you want more info.**](https://www.elprsdnt.com/8SWM4W1/DCC1P68/?uid=38397&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# Cons

1. **Pricey** ‚Äì It‚Äôs not the cheapest option, but considering that I won‚Äôt need to replace it anytime soon, it feels like a good investment for something I use every day.
2. **Limited to Clear Water** ‚Äì The UVBrite can‚Äôt purify murky water. It works best with clear tap water, filtered water, and clear water from natural sources.
3. **Slightly Heavier Than Plastic Bottles** ‚Äì This doesn‚Äôt bother me too much, but it‚Äôs worth noting if you‚Äôre used to lightweight bottles.

# Long-Term Use and Battery Life

One thing I was curious about was how often I‚Äôd need to charge the **UVBrite water bottle**. It turns out that a single charge lasts for around 60 cycles, which is roughly 9 gallons of water. I only need to recharge it once every three weeks or so, which is pretty convenient. It charges via USB, so I usually just plug it in overnight, and it‚Äôs ready to go by morning.

The UV-C light itself has a long life, and I read it‚Äôs supposed to last for years without needing a replacement. Given how frequently I use it, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs designed to last without needing maintenance.

# Verdict: Who is UVBrite For?

In my opinion, the **UVBrite Water Bottle** is best for people who are always out and about, drink a lot of water, or just don‚Äôt want the hassle of constantly cleaning their water bottle. The **UV-C light purification** makes it ideal for anyone who travels, hikes, or spends time in places where water quality might be questionable. I‚Äôm the type of person who likes being able to fill up wherever I am, so having that extra layer of purification is a big plus for me.

If you‚Äôre particular about the taste and quality of your water, this bottle can help ease any worries you might have. And if you‚Äôre trying to cut down on single-use plastics, it‚Äôs a solid choice.

# Final Thoughts

Using the UVBrite has made me a lot more confident about my water, especially when I‚Äôm filling up from public fountains or during outdoor activities. I used to carry around bulky filters or resort to plastic bottles when I wasn‚Äôt sure about water quality, but now this bottle pretty much handles it all. It‚Äôs a relief knowing I don‚Äôt have to worry about bacteria buildup inside the bottle or deal with bad odors.

Yes, it‚Äôs an investment, but I think it‚Äôs worth it if you‚Äôre looking for a high-quality, **self-cleaning water bottle** that lets you drink confidently from almost any clear water source.

It‚Äôs one of the newer names being talked about in keto and weight loss forums, and people seem curious about whether it really helps with weight loss. The idea behind Lipozem is to support natural weight loss by working with the body‚Äôs metabolism, controlling cravings, and boosting energy levels. But does it actually work, or is it just hype? Here‚Äôs a closer look at what Lipozem claims to offer, its ingredients, and whether it might be worth trying out.

# What is Lipozem?

Lipozem is marketed as a natural weight loss supplement designed to work with the body instead of against it. Unlike extreme diets or heavy stimulants that can make you feel tired or jittery, Lipozem claims to help the body burn fat more efficiently, control hunger, and even improve energy and focus. The idea is that by supporting these different aspects of weight management, Lipozem could help people get better results without as much struggle.

The main focus of Lipozem‚Äôs formula is **metabolism and fat burning**, which is why it‚Äôs popular with people following low-carb or keto diets. This supplement is manufactured in the USA and uses a blend of natural ingredients to avoid synthetic additives. But what‚Äôs in Lipozem, and how do these ingredients actually work?

# Lipozem‚Äôs Ingredients

One of the first things I look at with any supplement is the ingredients. With Lipozem, there‚Äôs a mix of natural components that each have their own roles. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key ingredients:

1. **Garcinia Cambogia**: This tropical fruit is often used in weight loss products because of its active compound, hydroxycitric acid (HCA). HCA may help block an enzyme that the body uses to make fat, potentially reducing fat storage. It‚Äôs also thought to boost serotonin levels, which can help control appetite and cravings.
2. **Green Coffee Bean Extract**: Green coffee beans are just regular coffee beans that haven‚Äôt been roasted. They contain chlorogenic acid, which might help with weight loss by lowering blood sugar levels and reducing fat absorption. This ingredient is popular for its potential to help control cravings without causing energy crashes.
3. **Raspberry Ketones**: Known for their ability to support fat burning, raspberry ketones can help increase the release of a hormone called adiponectin, which regulates metabolism. This could make it easier for the body to break down fat and use it for energy.
4. **African Mango Extract**: African Mango is becoming more common in weight loss supplements for its appetite-suppressing properties. It‚Äôs believed to help people feel full longer, making it easier to stick to a calorie deficit.
5. **L-Theanine**: Found in green tea, L-Theanine promotes relaxation without making you feel drowsy. It‚Äôs often included in supplements to support stress management and quality sleep, both of which can be essential for weight loss. Quality sleep helps regulate hormones related to hunger, so it‚Äôs an interesting addition to the formula.

Each of these ingredients has a specific role, which makes the formula seem well-thought-out. The combination of metabolism support, appetite control, and energy might make it easier to stick to a weight loss plan.

# How Lipozem Works

Lipozem is supposed to help in a few main ways:

1. **Boosting Metabolism**: With ingredients like raspberry ketones and garcinia cambogia, Lipozem aims to increase the body‚Äôs ability to burn fat. This could be especially helpful if you‚Äôre following a low-carb or keto diet, as it could enhance the fat-burning process.
2. **Controlling Appetite**: One of the toughest parts of weight loss is dealing with cravings. Ingredients like African mango extract and garcinia cambogia are included to help curb hunger, making it easier to stick to your diet.
3. **Increasing Energy**: Low energy is a common issue on a calorie-restricted diet. By including green coffee bean extract, Lipozem provides a natural energy boost without the jitters, which can help you feel more alert and active.
4. **Supporting Stress and Sleep**: L-Theanine is in the mix to promote relaxation and improve sleep quality. Good sleep is important for weight loss since it keeps hunger hormones in check and helps with overall recovery.

These four elements combined make Lipozem a pretty unique supplement in the weight loss world, targeting multiple areas that impact weight loss rather than just one.

# Pros and Cons of Lipozem

# Pros

* **Natural Ingredients**: For those who prefer plant-based supplements, Lipozem uses natural ingredients without synthetic fillers.
* **Multi-Targeted Approach**: It supports more than just fat burning, aiming to help with energy, cravings, and even sleep.
* **Money-Back Guarantee**: Lipozem offers a 180-day money-back guarantee, which provides a bit of reassurance if you‚Äôre on the fence about trying it.

# Cons

* **Price**: Lipozem isn‚Äôt the cheapest option out there, and you may need to use it for several months to see full results, which can add up.
* **Results May Vary**: Like any supplement, Lipozem might work well for some people and not as much for others. A lot depends on your diet, lifestyle, and consistency.
* **Not a Quick Fix**: It‚Äôs not a replacement for a balanced diet and exercise. To see the best results, you‚Äôd still need to follow a healthy lifestyle.

# Does Lipozem Actually Work?

The real question with any supplement is whether it delivers. The ingredients in Lipozem all have some science behind them, especially for people following a low-carb diet. BHB (Beta Hydroxybutyrate) isn‚Äôt in this particular formula, but Lipozem has a mix that still supports fat burning and metabolic health, which could be beneficial for keto or low-carb followers.

Based on the ingredients, Lipozem seems more likely to make weight loss a bit easier rather than producing instant, dramatic changes. You‚Äôll still need to eat well and stay active, but Lipozem might give you an edge if you struggle with energy, cravings, or maintaining a calorie deficit.

# Is Lipozem Worth Trying?

So, should you give Lipozem a shot? If you‚Äôre looking for a natural supplement to support weight loss, it might be worth trying. The combination of ingredients targets different areas that can make weight loss challenging, and the money-back guarantee means there‚Äôs not much risk involved. You can check out more information on the [**Official Website**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/2F98D3JW/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) if you want to learn more or see the different package options.

Lipozem probably won‚Äôt work miracles, but it could be a good support for people who need a little help with cravings, energy, or mood. It‚Äôs always smart to keep realistic expectations with any supplement. Lipozem might make things easier, but it won‚Äôt replace healthy habits.

# Final Thoughts

Lipozem seems like a well-rounded option for those looking to support their weight loss efforts with natural ingredients. With components aimed at boosting metabolism, reducing appetite, and enhancing sleep, it targets a few of the main challenges in weight management. If you‚Äôre consistent with your diet and exercise and are looking for something to make the journey a bit easier, Lipozem might be a good fit.

Her side; I am terrible with money. I don‚Äôt earn enough money. I can‚Äôt afford our house, cars, kids, etc‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt work hard enough. I‚Äôm a good dad, love my kids, but I get short tempered and snippy lately bc we never have money. (That part is true) 

My side; I work 3 jobs. One main job, 2 side hustles that bring in like 50k/yr in cash. We have joint accounts, I keep literally 10% of my main job‚Äôs paycheck to pay for gas and coffee. I haven‚Äôt touched our joint account in at least 2 years. She Amazon bills coming out of our account totaling over $2500 monthly for years (which also the amount of our mortgage). She has a brand new car. She spent $35,000 on bullshit ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù stuff (Botox, face lifts etc ‚Ä¶), my 2 year old has a $3000 bedroom set. And SOMEHOW I managed to keep up with all this for a really long time. The moment I couldn‚Äôt keep it up, I became the failure. 

Thats the cliff notes version. I can earn money. Thats just what I do. I have no doubt. I‚Äôve decided w/ my financial advisor and an attorney friend that even paying her off with ridiculously unfair percentages still leaves me in a better situation oddly enough. And it forces her into a position where the money she gets needs to be spent on necessities for the kids and housing before she can squander it. I‚Äôm at peace with this. 

Here‚Äôs the thing though, I am just assuming the role of failure bad guy. 50/50 custody, but The kids will be with her, I don‚Äôt want people around us thinking she‚Äôs a bad mom (she isn‚Äôt except for spending ) and prolonging anything.

Here's a new edition of ""Directors at the Box Office"", which seeks to explore the directors' trajectory at the box office and analyze their hits and bombs. I already talked about a few, and as I promised, it's Peter Weir's turn.

Weir attended The Scots College and Vaucluse Boys High School before studying arts and law at the University of Sydney. His interest in film was sparked by him meeting fellow students, including Phillip Noyce and the future members of the Sydney filmmaking collective Ubu Films. After leaving university in the mid-1960s, he joined Sydney television station ATN-7, where he worked as a production assistant on the groundbreaking satirical comedy program *The Mavis Bramston Show*. During this period, using station facilities, Weir made his first two experimental short films. He would then get a job at Commonwealth Film Unit, directing short documentaries. He would leave the CFU to finally direct films.

From a box office perspective, how reliable was he to deliver a box office hit?

That's the point of this post. To analyze his career.

#**It should be noted that as he started his career in the 1970s, the domestic grosses here will be adjusted by inflation. The table with his highest grossing films, however, will be left in its unadjusted form, as the worldwide grosses are more difficult to adjust.**

#**The Cars That Ate Paris (1974)**

*""148 people live in the township of Paris and every one of them is a murderer.""*

His directorial debut. It stars John Meillon, Terry Camilleri, and Kevin Miles. The film is set in the fictional town of Paris in which most of the inhabitants appear to be directly, or indirectly, involved in profiting from the results of car accidents.

There are no box office numbers available. The movie struggled to find an audience in Australia, changing distributors and using ad campaigns that pitched it alternately as a horror film and an art film. However it has become a cult film. By 1980, $112,500 had been returned to the producers. It also received positive reviews, with one of its fans being Stanley Kubrick. Weir was just getting started.

#**Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975)**

*""On St. Valentine's Day in 1900, a party of schoolgirls set out to picnic at Hanging Rock... some were never to return.""*

His second film. Based on the novel by Joan Lindsay, the film stars Rachel Roberts, Dominic Guard, Helen Morse, Vivean Gray and Jacki Weaver. The plot involves the disappearance of several schoolgirls and their teacher during a picnic at Hanging Rock, Victoria on Valentine's Day in 1900, and the subsequent effect on the local community.

The novel was published in 1967. Reading it four years later, Patricia Lovell thought it would make a great film. She did not originally think of producing it herself until Phillip Adams suggested she try it; she optioned the film rights in 1973, paying $100 for three months. She hired Weir to direct on the basis of his short film *Homesdale*, and Weir brought in Hal and Jim McElroy to help produce. Screenwriter David Williamson originally was chosen to adapt the film, but was unavailable and recommended noted TV writer Cliff Green. Joan Lindsay had approval over who did the adaptation and she gave it to Green, whose first draft Lovell says was ""excellent"".

Weir recalled that when the film was first screened in the United States, American audiences were disturbed by the fact that the mystery remained unsolved. According to Weir, ""One distributor threw his coffee cup at the screen at the end of it, because he'd wasted two hours of his life ‚Äî a mystery without a goddamn solution!""

The film was a box office hit, earning $5.12 million in Australia (or $3.36 million in US dollars). It received critical acclaim, and it has been named as one of the greatest Australian films ever made.

- **Budget:** $443,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $49,582. ($95,909 adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $3,414,057.

#**The Last Wave (1977)**

*""Hasn't the weather been strange... could it be a warning?""*

His third film. It stars Richard Chamberlain, Olivia Hamnett, David Gulpilil, and Nandjiwarra Amagula. It follows a white solicitor in Sydney whose seemingly normal life is disrupted after he takes on a murder case and discovers that he shares a strange, mystical connection with the small group of local Aboriginal people accused of the crime.

The film was another box office success and earning positive reviews.

- **Budget:** $818,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $866,250. ($4.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $1,692,800.

#**Gallipoli (1981)**

His fourth film. It stars Mel Gibson and Mark Lee. The film revolves around several young men from Western Australia who enlist in the Australian Army during World War I. They are sent to the Gallipoli peninsula in the Ottoman Empire, where they take part in the Gallipoli campaign. During the course of the film, the young men slowly lose their innocence about the purpose of war. 

Weir had wanted to make a film about the Gallipoli campaign since visiting Gallipoli in 1976 and discovering an empty Eno bottle on the beach. He wrote an outline of the script and gave it to David Williamson to turn into a screenplay. The script went through many variations; the South Australian Film Corporation did not like an early draft and said they did not want to fund the film, which then had a proposed budget of A$4.5 million. In May 1979 Weir asked Patricia Lovell to produce the film. The script then began to focus on the story of two runners. Lovell managed to raise A$850,000, which was not enough to make the film. 

However, Rupert Murdoch and Robert Stigwood announced they were forming a film company, R&R Films, later known as Associated R&R Films. This was a joint venture between News Corporation and the Robert Stigwood Organisation. They pledged an investment total of A$10m in local productions, with *Gallipoli* being the first.

The film was another critical and commercial success for Weir.

- **Budget:** $2,800,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $5,732,587. ($19.8 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $13,420,461.

#**The Year of Living Dangerously (1982)**

*""A love caught in the fire of revolution.""*

His fifth film. Based on the novel by Christopher Koch, it stars Mel Gibson, Sigourney Weaver, Bill Kerr, Michael Murphy, Linda Hunt, and Noel Ferrier. The story is about a love affair set in Indonesia during the overthrow of President Sukarno. It follows a group of foreign correspondents in Jakarta during the weeks leading up to the attempted coup by the 30 September Movement in 1965.

A number of filmmakers were interested in buying the rights to Koch's novel including Phillip Noyce. It was Weir who was successful. Koch wrote an early draft but Weir was unhappy with it. Alan Sharp wrote three more drafts, then David Williamson was brought on to do several more drafts. Koch later came back on to work on some of the voice over, although he never spoke with Peter Weir. The film was originally backed by the South Australian Film Corporation and the Australian Film Commission, with international distribution arranged by MGM/UA Entertainment Company. However, the SAFC then dropped out and Weir's agent suggested MGM provide the entire $6 million budget themselves, which is what happened. It was by far the most ambitious Australian film undertaken at the time and was one of the first co-productions between Australia and a Hollywood studio.

Dancer David Atkins was originally cast as Billy Kwan. However, during rehearsals Weir began to feel that the relationship between his character and Mel Gibson's was not working so he decided to recast. Several actors auditioned, including Bob Balaban and Wallace Shawn, when Weir saw a photo of Linda Hunt. He asked for her to audition and decided to cast her. Weir said on casting Hunt, ""I never would have started out looking for a woman, [...] But from the moment I saw her test, I knew she was appropriate."" To accomplish the role during production, Hunt shortened ""her hair and dye[d] it black[,] wore padding around her waist, shaved her eyebrows, and carried something in her shirt pocket.""

The film was a modest success at the box office, and it earned critical acclaim. For the film, Linda Hunt won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, making her the first person to win an Oscar for portraying a character of the opposite sex. However, in subsequent years, the film is often mentioned as an example of yellowface, as Hunt portrayed a Chinese-American man. 

- **Budget:** $5,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $10,278,575. ($33.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $12,183,525.

#**Witness (1985)**

*""A big city cop. A small country boy. They have nothing in common... but a murder.""*

His sixth film. The film stars Harrison Ford, Kelly McGillis, Josef Sommer, Lukas Haas, Jan Rube≈°, Danny Glover, Alexander Godunov, Patti LuPone and Viggo Mortensen. Its plot focuses on a police detective protecting an Amish woman and her son, who becomes a target after he witnesses a brutal murder in a Philadelphia railway station.

Producer Edward S. Feldman, who was in a ""first-look"" development deal with 20th Century Fox at the time, first received the screenplay in 1983. Originally titled *Called Home*, which is the Amish term for death, it ran for 182 pages, the equivalent of three hours of screen time. The script, which had been circulating in Hollywood for several years, began with an idea by novelist Pamela Wallace for a novel about an Amish woman who witnesses a murder in Los Angeles. Earl W. Wallace, who wrote for the television Western *How the West Was Won* recalled an episode with a similar plot and contacted its writer, William Kelley. Earl Wallace and Kelley wrote the original screenplay together. Nevertheless, Fox turned down the script, saying they don't do ""rural movies.""

Feldman sent the screenplay to Harrison Ford's agent Phil Gersh, who contacted the producer four days later and advised him his client was willing to commit to the film. Certain the attachment of a major star would change the studio's mind, but they insisted that as much as the studio liked Ford, they still were not interested in making a ""rural movie."" Feldman sent the screenplay to numerous studios, and was rejected by all of them, until Paramount finally expressed interest. Feldman's first choice of director was Weir, but he was turned it down due to scheduling conflicts. Then, as financial backing for his film fell through, Weir became free to direct *Witness*, which was his first American film.

With a major studio backing him with a big star, Weir had his biggest success. It had a slow start, but picked up steam very quickly, closing with $68.7 million domestically and $116.1 million worldwide. It also received critical acclaim, and Ford's performance is considered by many as the best of his career. Weir received his first Oscar nomination for Best Director, and the film was also nominated for Best Picture. He hit it big in America.

- **Budget:** $12,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $68,706,993. ($201.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $116,106,993.

#**The Mosquito Coast (1986)**

*""How far should a man go to find his dream? Allie Fox went to the Mosquito Coast. He went too far.""*

His seventh film. Based on the novel by Paul Theroux, it stars Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren, Andre Gregory, and River Phoenix. The film tells the story of a family that leaves the United States and tries to find a happier and simpler life in the jungles of Central America. However, their jungle paradise quickly turns into a dystopia as their stubborn father's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and aggressive.

Producer Jerome Hellman bought the rights to Theroux's novel as soon as it was published, and Weir committed to filming it. Jack Nicholson was originally offered the lead role, but backed out over salary disputes.

As the film went into pre-production, and Weir was in Central America scouting for locations, the financial backing for the film fell through and the project was suspended indefinitely. In the meantime, Weir was approached to direct *Witness* starring Harrison Ford. The film, which was Weir's first American production, was a critical and commercial success. During production, Weir discussed *The Mosquito Coast* with Ford who became interested in the role of Allie Fox (though Ford's agent was less enthusiastic). With Ford attached to the project, financial backing and distribution for the film was easier to find.

While Weir and Ford hit a home run with *Witness*, it wasn't the same here. The film bombed at the box office, and received lukewarm reviews, although its reputation has grown in subsequent years.

- **Budget:** $25,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $14,302,779. ($41.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $14,302,779.

#**Dead Poets Society (1989)**

*""He was their inspiration. He made their lives extraordinary.""*

His eighth film. It stars Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Josh Charles, Gale Hansen, Dylan Kussman, Allelon Ruggiero, James Waterston, Norman Lloyd, and Kurtwood Smith. The film is set in 1959 at a fictional elite boarding school called Welton Academy, and tells the story of an English teacher who inspires his students through his teaching of poetry.

Jeff Kanew was originally hired as the director, and Kanew had envisioned Liam Neeson in the role of Keating. Other actors considered for the role were Dustin Hoffman, Mel Gibson, Tom Hanks and Mickey Rourke. Robin Williams, who was Disney's preferred choice, was ultimately cast, but on the first day of shooting outside Atlanta, Williams did not show, for he did not want to work with Kanew. The studio burned down the already-built sets, and replaced Kanew with another director. In late 1988, Weir met with Jeffrey Katzenberg at Disney. Katzenberg, who oversaw Touchstone Pictures, suggested that Weir read Tom Schulman's script. On the flight back to Sydney, Weir was captivated, and six weeks later returned to Los Angeles to cast the principal characters. It was when Weir was given directing duties that filming began in earnest.

In Schulman's manuscript, Keating had been ill and slowly dying of Hodgkin lymphoma, with a scene showing him on his hospital deathbed. This was removed by Weir, who deemed it unnecessary, claiming that it would focus audiences' attention on Keating's illness, rather than on what he stood for. Early notes on the script from Disney also suggested making the boys' passion dancing rather than poetry, as well as a new title, *Sultans of Swing*, focusing on the character of Mr. Keating, rather than on the boys, but both were dismissed outright.

Disney decided to let the film begin in limited release, allowing word of mouth to spread. And it worked, as the film gained extraordinary reception (""A+"" on CinemaScore), closing with $95 million domestically and $235 million worldwide. It also received critical acclaim, with many naming it one of the best films of the 80s. It received 4 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, winning Best Original Screenplay. 

- **Budget:** $16,400,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $95,860,116. ($243.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $235,860,116.

#**Green Card (1990)**

*""The story of two people who got married, met and then fell in love.""*

His ninth film. It stars G√©rard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell, and focuses on an American woman who enters into a marriage of convenience with a Frenchman so he can obtain a green card and remain in the United States.

Despite mixed reviews, it was a box office success.

- **Budget:** $12,500,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $29,888,235. ($72.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $37,888,235.

#**Fearless (1993)**

*""Some people are afraid of nothing.""*

His tenth film. Based on the novel by Rafael Yglesias, it stars Jeff Bridges, Isabella Rossellini, Rosie Perez and John Turturro. Max Klein, a survivor of a plane crash, is unable to relate to his former life. Coping with changes in his personality, he also helps another survivor, a grieving mother, deal with her loss.

The film received critical acclaim, but it was a box office bomb.

- **Budget:** $20,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $6,995,302. ($15.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $6,995,302.

#**The Truman Show (1998)**

*""On the air. Unaware.""*

His 11th film. The film stars Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Ed Harris, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone, Holland Taylor, Paul Giamatti, and Brian Delate. The film depicts the story of Truman Burbank, a man who is unaware that he is living his entire life on a colossal soundstage, and that it is being filmed and broadcast as a reality television show which has a huge international following. All of his friends, family and members of his community are paid actors of whose job it is to sustain the illusion and keep Truman unaware about the false world he inhabits.

Andrew Niccol completed a one-page film treatment titled *The Malcolm Show* in May 1991. The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Niccol stated, ""I think everyone questions the authenticity of their lives at certain points. It's like when kids ask if they're adopted."" Scott Rudin purchased the script for slightly over $1 million, and Paramount agreed to distribute. Part of the deal called for Niccol to make his directing debut, though Paramount executives felt the estimated $80 million budget would be too high for him. In addition, Paramount wanted to go with an A-list director, paying Niccol extra money ""to step aside"". 

Brian De Palma was under negotiations to direct before he left UTA in March 1994. Directors who were considered after De Palma's departure included Tim Burton, Sam Raimi, Terry Gilliam, David Cronenberg, Barry Sonnenfeld and Steven Spielberg before Weir signed on in early 1995, following a recommendation of Niccol. Bryan Singer wanted to direct but Paramount decided to go with the more experienced Weir. Under Weir's leadership, the film managed to cost $20 million lower than anticipated.

One of Weir's requests was that the film needed to be funnier, feeling that Niccol's script was too dark, and declaring, ""where [Niccol] had it depressing, I could make it light. It could convince audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7."" Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming. Niccol rewrote the script twelve times, while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show's history. He envisioned backstories for the characters and encouraged actors to do the same.

In 1995, Jim Carrey signed to star, but because of commitments with *The Cable Guy* and *Liar Liar*, he would not be ready to start filming for at least another year. Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role. Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in *Ace Ventura: Pet Detective*, citing that Carrey's performance reminded him of Charlie Chaplin. Carrey took the role so he would be known as a multifaceted actor, rather than being typecast in comedic roles. Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do the film for $12 million. Carrey also said it was the fastest that he ever accepted a role. Carrey brought his own innovations to the role, including the idea for the scene in which Truman declares ""this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy"" to the bathroom mirror.

The film started production with Dennis Hopper in the role of Cristof, but he left in April 1997 soon after filming began. Hopper later stated that he was fired after two days because Weir and producer Scott Rudin had made a deal that if they did not both approve of Hopper's performance, they would replace him. A number of other actors turned down the role after Hopper's departure, until Ed Harris agreed to step in. Harris later stated that he pitched the notion of making Christof a hunchback, but Weir did not like the idea.

The film debuted with $31 million, legging out to $125 million domestically and $264 million worldwide, becoming Weir's highest grossing film. It received universal acclaim, becoming one of the most iconic films of the past 30 years. Weir received another Oscar nomination for Best Director, while Niccol and Harris also received nominations. It has become one of the most analyzed films ever.

- **Budget:** $60,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $125,618,201. ($242.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $264,118,712.

#**Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)**

*""The courage to do the impossible lies in the hearts of men.""*

His 12th film. Based on the Aubrey‚ÄìMaturin series by Patrick O'Brian, it stars Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. In 1805, aboard the H.M.S. Surprise, the brash Captain Jack Aubrey and his trusted friend, the ship's scholarly surgeon, Stephen Maturin, are ordered to hunt down and capture a powerful French vessel off the South American coast. Though Napoleon is winning the war and the men and their crew face an onslaught of obstacles, including their own internal battles, ""Lucky Jack"" is determined that nothing will stop the Surprise from completing its mission.

20th Century Fox executive Tom Rothman had wished to adapt O'Brian's novels since first reading them, recognizing the potential for a film franchise. When he became the CEO, he recruited director Weir to helm the project. The film combines elements from three different novels by O'Brian, but its principal source is his tenth novel, *The Far Side of the World*.

While Fox gave it $150 million, the film could only earn $211 million worldwide. But it received universal acclaim, earning Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Director. Weir was just killing it quality-wise. Originally intended to spawn a franchise, it has been stuck in development hell. A prequel was confirmed in 2021, and in a recent interview, 20th Century Studios said the script was ready but are still looking for a director.

- **Budget:** $150,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $93,927,920. ($160.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $211,622,535.

#**The Way Back (2010)**

*""Their escape was just the beginning.""*

His 13th and final film. The film stars Jim Sturgess, Colin Farrell, Ed Harris, Saoirse Ronan, Alexandru Potocean, Sebastian Urzendowsky, Gustaf Skarsg√•rd, Drago»ô Bucur and Mark Strong. The film is inspired by *The Long Walk*, the memoir by former Polish prisoner of war S≈Çawomir Rawicz, who claimed to have escaped from a Soviet Gulag and walked 4,000 miles (6,400 km) to freedom in World War II.

The film received positive reviews, but bombed at the box office.

- **Budget:** $30,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $2,701,859. ($3.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $24,172,201.

#**The End**

Well, if you were wondering ""why is Peter Weir not making a new film? Where is he?"" He already answered that, and it ain't good news.

Ethan Hawke suggested that he lost interest in movies and that ""Russell Crowe and Johnny Depp broke him."" Weir himself debunked that statement, saying that it must have been taken out of context. And then, we got a word from the man himself, who confirmed what many feared: he was retired.

> ""for film directors, like volcanoes, there are three major stages: active, dormant and extinct. I think I've reached the latter! Another generation is out there calling ""action"" and ""cut"" and good luck to them.""

And in another interview last year:

> ‚ÄúI am retired. Why did I stop cinema? Because, quite simply, I have no more energy.‚Äù

#**The Verdict**

While not all his films were profitable, Weir has proved himself to be a very reliable filmmaker.

The most fascinating thing about him is his versatility. He doesn't stick to just one genre. He has made a horror comedy, a mystery film, a war film, a crime thriller, a coming-of-age film, a rom-com, a psychological dramedy, a historical epic, and a survival film. With a complete mastery of his craft. He emerged as one of the strongest figures of the Australian New Wave.

News of his retirement is quite bittersweet, albeit a predictable outcome. When you spend over a decade without a single project, rumors start circulating that you're done with movies, which he later confirmed to be true. On the one hand, it's sad that won't get more films, given that he is a damn excellent filmmaker. From 1998 to 2024, we've had just 3 films from him. On the other, he has said he simply doesn't have energy like he used to back in the day, and that's understandable. If a filmmaker feels he already told whatever he wanted to say, who are we to tell him to continue churning out films if he doesn't want to? The Legend is 80 years old, pals. Let him enjoy retirement.

Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.

The next director will be **Michael Cimino**. There's making a flop, and then there's making a flop so huge you destroy a whole damn studio and era.

I asked you to choose who else should be in the run and the comment with the most upvotes would be chosen. Well, we'll later talk about... >!Taika Waititi.!< Is it truly Joever?

November 11-17 | Sam Mendes | How cool is it to win an Oscar on your first film?
November 18-24 | Guy Ritchie | Justice for *King Arthur*.
November 25-December 1 | Taika Waititi | Can he bounce back?

Who should be next after Waititi? That's up to you. And there's a theme.

We already covered this with the Coens, but I'm bringing it back. And that theme is... **directing duos.** A team of two or more who directed films. You know, the Wachowskis, the Farrellys, the Safdies, etc. They can direct films separately, but they still have to be known for being a duo.

Hello!

I've had my breville infuser for several years and it's worked great. However this morning I pulled my usual double shot with 15g-16g  for my partner and it worked fine.

Immediately after that I made myself a cup of coffee but when I went to pull it, nothing came out. It sounded like it was working, even doing the pre infusion and you could hear it increasing pressure. But the pressure gauge didn't move, it just showed no pressure and the water went into the drip tray.

What's odd is if there's no grind in the portafilter it'll go through the group head and not to the drip tray. It's only when I add coffee that it'll immediately go to the drip tray with no pressure showing on the gauge.

So far I've descaled it using powder and cleaned the group head the best I can. It's still having problems.

Any thoughts?

She has always been critical of me. Nothing has ever been good enough. The last straw, when I gave her a piece of my mind, was being told that being sexually active (as she assumes, in truth depends if you consider dry humping sexually active) outside of marriage makes me ""nothing short of a common slushie"".

As a result of my response. I've been told she doesn't want to see or hear from me again.

Other criticisms include:

Im not a ""real"" girl. The reason I have an intersex condition and am unable to have children isn't because I inherited a faulty X chromosome from my mother, but because, just like the [nasty word for black people], I wasn't as valiant in the pre-existence.

I've never had any respect as evidenced by, about 8 years ago when her son was being baptised, I referred to the font as the sheep dip.

I left the church, not because intensive study showed me it was bullshit, but because I couldn't live up to its standards.

Piercing my nose and drinking coffee means I treat my body as a penny arcade, not as a temple.

im a student who discovered this cafe 2 minutes from my dorm, it‚Äôs not like a regular cafe it‚Äôs more like sit down vibes, anywho, the first time i saw him he immediately strikes up a conversation with me, about the most awkward thing, how small the bathroom is üò≠ i wasn‚Äôt really interested in chatting but he had a playful energy and he even complimented my star pimple patches. the next time i saw him, when he saw me, he went, ‚Äúhey!‚Äù quite excitedly, but still i didn‚Äôt really think much. this escalated to a moment when i was sitting in the park with my friend at around 9pm when we notice this waiter come up to us with his friend, his friend comes and asks us what material do we think his (the waiter) jacket is, i stupidly say cotton, and then he laughs and says boyfriend material. then he says, he‚Äôs italian and wants your number. the waiter is so embarrassed and is begging his friend to stop embarrassing him, and we politely decline. i thought this moment was just a coincidence and that we were just random people they came up to in the park, but now im not so sure.

following that experience i became more excited to see him at the cafe. i would ask how he was more, and seemed generally interested in him. this is when things escalated, he would put his hand on my shoulder more now, or linger on my back when he said goodnight. this would make me blush and i didn‚Äôt mind. one night i went to get some dessert and he seemed very stressed out, he shared some things that were going on in his life and i felt very bad about them. so, i devised that next time i would see him id give him a small gift, a chocolate bar and a card to cheer him up, and when i gave it to him, he gave me a long hug and paid for my coffee. 

this brings us to today, the flirting in the cafe has continued. but i never thought it would be serious or mean anything until now. he walked by me in the park a couple days ago, and said wait here 10 minutes, then he came back with fruit and i invited him to sit with me and we talked for 30 minutes and shared blueberries. he told me that he‚Äôs going back to italy on the 12th and i told him that made me very sad. i went back to the cafe on halloween and asked him to chat with me on the bench again, and we are meeting on tuesday at 2, and i said id bring raspberries which he said he loved. 

am i crazy for thinking anything could happen before he leaves for italy?? i really like him, or should i just leave it as two friends who talk on the bench. am i crazy. idk. i keep thinking about our interactions.   ",1,1730574505.0,datingadvice,2,1.0,False

I work for a company and oversee multiple locations each having their own therapy director. I‚Äôm in an executive position overseeing them all and a PT by trade. 

I‚Äôd really like to get some nice holiday gifts for each of them this year and I‚Äôm scouting for ideas! I usually default to coffee gift cards but wondering if there is something else that would work. 

We are not all in the same state, so it does need to be something that I could mail.  I also have both male and female directors so I need some thing that‚Äôs pretty neutral. Not everyone drinks alcohol so that is kind of out as well. 

I can probably afford max $50/person (I know I said exec, but it‚Äôs not that glamorous actually lol) and I‚Äôm buying this myself, not company money. 

I just appreciate them so much and they‚Äôve been working so hard this year, I really want to make sure they know that. 

So what would you all like for the holidays?!

Hey keto friends! üôå I've been on a journey to find a good substitute for Coffee Mate in my coffee. Coffee Mate is a tasty go-to for many, but it‚Äôs definitely not keto-friendly with the added sugars and carbs. So, I've been experimenting and wanted to share a few great alternatives that don‚Äôt knock me out of ketosis.

# 1. Heavy Cream ü•õ

This is the most straightforward option‚Äîheavy cream has almost no carbs and adds a nice creamy texture. It‚Äôs rich, but a small amount goes a long way.

# 2. MCT Oil or Powder üíß

MCT oil or powder is amazing if you want a quick energy boost. It keeps my coffee super creamy and helps me stay full longer. Just a heads up, too much MCT oil can mess with your stomach, so start small if you're new to it.

# 3. Coconut Cream ü••

If you like a bit of coconut flavor, coconut cream is a great alternative. It‚Äôs low in carbs and has a subtle sweetness without added sugars.

# 4. Nut-Based Creamers üå∞

Brands like Nutpods or Califia Farms have almond and coconut milk creamers that are low-carb and work well on keto. Some come in flavors like vanilla or hazelnut if you‚Äôre missing the flavored Coffee Mate options.

# 5. Butter or Ghee üßà

Sounds odd, but bulletproof coffee (adding butter or ghee) is really popular in keto circles. It adds a creamy texture and keeps you full‚Äîjust blend it to get a frothy consistency.

**Bonus Tip**: If you need a touch of sweetness, monk fruit or stevia works well without the carbs!

Hope this helps anyone else looking to replace Coffee Mate! What‚Äôs your favorite keto coffee addition? Let‚Äôs swap tips! ‚òï

I just moved into a townhouse and I‚Äôm struggling to figure out how to decorate. For size reference, the couch is 80‚Äù long. 

The things I like the location of currently are:
- Bookshelf behind couch
- Shelves on the wall
- Couch/T.V.

I‚Äôm unsure about:
- Plant stand (please note I have a secondary one in another room and I‚Äôm not opposed to bringing it in here.)
- Where/how to hang pictures. I have a few smaller sized frames and what you see already on the wall. 

Things I intend to get:
- Rug
- Coffee Table (The tv stand will be swapped out and the tv will be mounted to allow space for this.)

I thought about moving the bookshelf to be in that empty space next to the TV but it‚Äôs heavy and I don‚Äôt want to move it if I‚Äôm just going to hate it after. 

Eventually there will be a rug, but the walls just look so bare. I have a 6‚Äô vertical mirror I‚Äôd like to hang in the living room but I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out if that would look good either. Please help. My computer is broke so I can‚Äôt use the sims to lay it all out :‚Äô( 

Also, the internet cables and all that mess will eventually be moved out of this room so ignore those.

This morning I decided to wake up early, get myself all ready and bundled up for the rain, and drive to a new coffee shop in my hometown. It was dark when I left my house. I arrived there at 7am and I was the only one there. I ordered a latte and a scone. As the rain was pouring outside, I felt so cozy and wonderful. I even brought a book with me and read a chapter as I finished my drink. 

It was such a nice experience, almost felt like I found a special quiet space that I could hang out at in the mornings. Somewhere I could spend time before work/errands.

1gi3pd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gi3pd3/why_do_i_keep_feeling_faint_f25/,Why do I keep feeling faint? F25 ,"Hi, some advice or insight into what this is would be great! 

So, I‚Äôve always had times in my childhood and teens where I have felt faint, and whilst it hasn‚Äôt happened a lot I do feel like it has happened more frequently than most - often I put this down to perhaps dehydration or not eating enough. When I was younger it would often feel like I was going underwater with large block spots in my vision 

Recently however, I feel like it‚Äôs become more frequent and whilst at times I could say maybe I was dehydrated it also feels very random (I‚Äôm mentioning the dehydration a lot as I definitely should be drinking more water and so far in the past I‚Äôve put it down to this). In more recent occasions I‚Äôve often felt better by sitting down though and just taking deep breaths. 

Typically what will happen now is when I move my head about or my eyes it feels like the motion of it happens very quickly, I will begin to feel really warm and as though I can‚Äôt focus. In some ways I feel mostly out of it and whilst I can go on to pretend to be ok I find it easier to take a seat and have a few deep breaths. 

The stand out two times have happened within a month, both when I was out shopping. The first I had felt tired, drank a coffee to help and then fifteen minutes later I felt the usual symptoms however then I felt quite panicked. Not mentally but when people around me would move or talk it was as though I kept getting a jump scare. After leaving the area I was nearly crying but in my mind I didn‚Äôt understand why. I do think this was perhaps a small panic attack which was brought on my being tired and then shooting my adrenaline up due to the coffee

Yet, it happened earlier today when I was shopping once more. I had half an hour or more before eaten a healthy salad and had a large drink and felt fine before later feeling the same symptoms. I removed myself from the situation and sat down so it didn‚Äôt escalate but even after I have I still don‚Äôt quite feel myself 


I‚Äôm really confused what this may be and why it feels like it‚Äôs happening much more frequently all of a sudden - any suggestions would be great!

Crispy on the outside, tender and slightly chewy on the inside, these low carb snickerdoodles are everything you love about a great keto cookie! The toasty coating of cinnamon & sweetener makes these keto snickerdoodle cookies simply perfect with a cup of coffee!  Cookies are my absolute favorite sweet treat.  Mostly because I like their portability, built in portion control (unless you eat all of them. . . not that I'd know from experience ?,) and the fact that you can eat multiple keto cookies of different kinds without committing to one large  a person who likes to try a bite of everything, low carb cookies are my dessert  year I put together a collection of 30 of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, and now I'm adding a few more to the blog for you to try - starting with these low carb snickerdoodles! Like all of my favorite low carb cookie recipes, these are pretty easy to make! A bonus because when I start thinking I could go for a cookie, I like to be eating said keto cookie within 30 minutes or less.  ???

To make these keto snickerdoodle cookies, all you need to do is mix up your ingredients, roll the cookies into balls and dip in the cinnamon and sweetener mixture, then flatten slightly and bake for 15 minutes.  Mission accomplished! ?Toasty, cinnamon-y, cookie perfection.  Believe it.  I tried freezing these low carb snickerdoodles to see how they would hold up and they were just as good if not better than before I'd frozen them. They keep perfectly at room temperature in a sealed container for up to four days (that's how long ours  inside texture of the cookies got a little chewier every day, while the outside stayed toasty and crisp - it was awesome! I implore you to make these keto snickerdoodle cookies ASAP, and then report back as to what you thought of them! I have a feeling that once you try them, you'll be making them over and over again like I have!

1gi3ntt,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/1gi3ntt/i_worry_that_i_am_indeed_being_defeatist_in/,I worry that I am indeed being defeatist in relation to overcoming social isolation as a young person.,"I‚Äôm 26 and I know there is no such thing of what a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù social life should look like. Nor do I feel like I‚Äôm missing out or feel that my lack of socialising impedes on my quality of life. I enjoy spending time on my own going to botanical gardens and looking at sheep. I go on day trips alone, go have a coffee in a cafe.  Basically, I do what other people may prefer doing with a family member or friend that I personally enjoy doing on my own.

My question was prompted after seeing my GP who asked whether I‚Äôm seeing people more often. To which I responded that I go out with people only a couple times a year, but i‚Äôve always been like this. I always try to clarify that my normality is to socialise to the bare minimum. That the goal of becoming more socially active for me is not about me returning to a state where I want to do things I once did, it Is about learning to be socially active. Which is not something I have desire to start doing. 

I do have some concerns. One is growing confusion over why people seek romantic/sexual partnerships and too many other ‚Äúwhy‚Äôs‚Äù in other social ties between people. The largest concern is that I do feel a bit like I‚Äôm just waiting until things come to an end and  wonder what the heck should I be doing for the next 40 years or so. I find myself increasingly confused about the excitement and fuss over annual events. I know this sounds contradictory, but I feel that my confusion isn‚Äôt a sign of  being discontent. I‚Äôm ok with my life, but there‚Äôs a niggling feeling of being an outsider not able to comprehend the world they are living in. That maybe something is not quite right.

A common pattern in my relationship attempts is that once things are going just right and I feel like I need to make the next step forward I chicken out and run away from them. Usually keep telling myself some stupid reason why they are not enough or too much for me and back out from the relationship.

Anyways lets go back to this girl, I basically befriended this entire friend group this year and turned out she was the nicest prettiest girl in that group. I like her a lot and I feel that she likes me too. Although we are just friends rn, sometimes we can be really open with each other and I decided to ask her out. 

Basically it was never said out loud that its a date since I just kindof invited her to join me on my journey doing some stuff in the center and grab some coffee besides that. So she arrived, I bought some things i needed then we went for a coffee which lasted for like 2 hours and also went for a decent walk after that before walking back to the station. I actually enjoyed the meet a lot and although I never asked her how she felt after that, we still text to this day.. its school break so still a couple days till we see each other.

this meet was pleasant but very friendly. I was asking a couple of my friends if they think this is a problem either because on my part that I may not be attracted to her or because just in general when you ask her out you should make your intentions clear So the 1mil$ question is that can that attraction develop and do I try to push another girl away cause shes not perfect for my standards or I just overthink this because im lonely as fuck and want to jump into a relationship to ease my pain.

I‚Äôm excited to share a project my buddy and I have been working on, and we‚Äôre curious if anyone would like to learn more about it.

Our project is an open-source upgrade for the Gaggia espresso machine, designed to add smart controls that improve the coffee-making experience. By adding a display and custom electronics, you‚Äôll be able to monitor and control the machine with ease. If you‚Äôre familiar with Gaggiuino, it‚Äôs similar‚Äîbut with some important differences.

The biggest difference is that our project, GaggiMate, is completely open source (unlike Gaggiuino, which recently went closed-source) and more affordable. Plus, I think the interface has a better look and feel (though I might be a bit biased! üòÑ).

You can check out the project on GitHub here: https://github.com/jniebuhr/gaggimate.

Our lead developer, Jochen, is based in Italy and recently put together a custom board for GaggiMate to simplify the setup process. We‚Äôre currently organizing a small group-buy for the board and would love for anyone interested to join in! More info on this will be on the discord channel dedicated to this project.

**Features Ready So Far**

We‚Äôre actively developing the project, and here‚Äôs what‚Äôs already functional:

* Temperature Control: Monitor boiler temperature to maintain the best brewing conditions.
* Brew Timer: Set and run your desired brew time with accuracy.
* Steam and Hot Water Mode: Control pump and valve functions with ease, including a steam booster that‚Äôs currently being refined.
* Safety Features: Includes an automatic shutdown if the system overheats or becomes unresponsive.
* User Interface: A simple, intuitive display for seamless control and monitoring.
* HomeKit Integration: Move the controls to your phone for remote operation. (We‚Äôre also planning MQTT integration for Home Assistant users.)

We‚Äôre also actively working on new features that we‚Äôll be sharing soon!

**Cost**

While we‚Äôre still exploring manufacturing options, we estimate the custom board cost will be around ‚Ç¨20, and an additional ‚Ç¨40-‚Ç¨45 for screen, SSR and thermocouple should be expected for the full kit.  
It is however possible to build everything from self-sourced parts, and the github repo has a BOM with links if you want to build it from scratch.

We‚Äôve attached some pictures showing a Gaggia Paros fitted with a development kit version of GaggiMate, along with screenshots and concept images. Don‚Äôt worry if you have a Gaggia Classic Pro ‚Äî photos and videos of the mod on that model are coming soon.

1gi3iub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fidelity/comments/1gi3iub/account_blocked_second_time_not_sure_why_this_time/,"Account blocked second time, not sure why this time","I'm a relatively new member of Fidelity (signed up in May) and had gotten my account blocked in July after depositing the check that was sent by my last bank. I then learned that banks do put blocks if they see any amounts being deposited that are >10k because of ""structuring,"" which makes sense. It's reasonable to block accounts that deposit big amounts if the suspicion is based on fraud, but these were my meager savings. How else would members deposit cash with a new bank if they have even larger savings? 

When I verified with them on the call in July, they told me they found it strange that two of my other accounts are empty. That is fair but I didn't think having no money in two accounts was necessarily a violation of their policy and I wanted to keep them there once I had more knowledge about finances.

They removed the block nonetheless and had my Bill Pay also enabled once more. Prior to the verification, I wondered if I was a target of a cyber attack but I thought it was unreasonable considering I'm a new member and my info wasn't in any data breaches of recent. I didn't think much of it anymore after my account was unblocked, esp after I learned about the stupid trend of check fraud. 

Fast forward to October and I have my account blocked along with Bill Pay cancelled. I already called their representative yesterday and he told me the only thing he could do was send in a service request to their back team. I asked him if the bank was just doing this as a precaution based on the check fraud trend. He told me he can't say because it could be for a number of reasons and he can't see. We ended the call based on the notice that the back team may call me in 7-10 days (business days). 

This is incredibly frustrating considering I didn't deposit any checks recently and don't think I did anything suspicious. The only thing I can think of that may have been weird was making more transactions because of a recent trip where I ate out a lot, but how would eating at restaurants be a cause for concern? Other thing I can think of is also making more regular payments at cafes for coffees and whatnot, but I don't think this is out of the regular. Probably many more people out there making more frequent transactions than myself and sipping coffee everyday. 

I don't know what triggered the block, but this was out of the blue and has been a major cause of distress. I'm not sure if anyone else has dealt with something similar.",3,1730573616.0,Fidelity,11,0.8,False
1gi3ifj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1gi3ifj/brutal_ex/,Brutal ex,"I met this guy at work, we clicked in so well, we started dating everything was pitch perfect. He would buy me things, spend quality time, go out, take risks together just name it. Later he ended up giving me a skin condition and blamed me for having it the entire time (which I never did) it was passed on from him. That was some trauma I dealt with. I snuck him into my house this one time and the next morning my mom knocked on the door so I had to hide him. He forgot to take his phone with him and of course I had a intuition so I snooped through his phone and found out he had another instagram, a post of this ‚Äúlong distant‚Äù girlfriend with the caption ‚Äúhappy national gf day‚Äù which was posted 2 months prior. And 2 months ago I realized this mf crashed my car and I had to take the fault for it to protect him. I was furious I tried kicking him out and breaking up but he pins me down and begs me to forgive him. I was so blinded in love that the excuse he used: ‚Äúshe‚Äôs suicidal I couldn‚Äôt just leave‚Äù and claims to say he barley spoke to her. I believed it and told him to back off slowly. (Ofc that was a lie.) we tried moving further but it was so complicated. He switched blames just because I had a guy best friend in the beginning of our relationship which caused him to be ‚ÄúJealous.‚Äù It‚Äôs stupid cause I cut my best friend off. Anyways we bettered things he gave me a promise ring (his family knew of me.) I somehow logged into his ‚Äúsneaky‚Äù instagram account and found the whole truth that he‚Äôs been dating this girl for about 3-4 years and she‚Äôs underaged. I felt sick to my stomach and next thing you know he pulls up to my house ‚Äúto talk‚Äù forces me in his car and threatens to not drop me home till I don‚Äôt tell him ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs our next move.‚Äù I told him my parents will be worried and this mf had the audacity to say ‚Äúthey‚Äôll think you moved out.‚Äù Anyways I somehow managed to get dropped home.. it‚Äôs a blur we still continued to date, but then again after all this bs he pulled I was lacking on trust, love, and respect which caused arguments and ofc I was the one to get blamed for it. Recently I thought we were doing great, he rode his bike 1h to come see me at work bring me coffee all that extra shit and the next day I was going through my email somehow I was logged into his and found out he had another sc account filled with girls. I told him to fuck off and he switching blames and has the audacity to get pissed. 4years of this bs where broken up now for good I‚Äôm not blinded I now see that this mf deserves some sort of penalty ",1,1730573586.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

1gi3f7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_juicytasty/comments/1gi3f7h/trump_tariffs_household_calculation/,Trump tariffs household calculation,"I heard that the proposed Trump tariffs of 60% on goods from China and 20% from other countries outside of the US will cost the average household $4,000 per year, and I wanted to calculate that to find out if it would be accurate my family. According to my calculations, my family will spend an additional $410 a month or $4,920 a year on tariffs. Do my calculations seem accurate? Am I leaving something out?

Some questions and observations:

* How will this change my family's diet? I don't think we'll consume less coffee, tea, bananas,  chocolate, or pasta, but I might start buying California wine and olive oil over European wine and Mediterranean olive oil.
* Will clothing manufacturers shift more production away from China and toward Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia?
* I knew being able to buy cheap batteries on Amazon was just too good to last. Do any countries besides China manufacture batteries? Is there any chance of this moving to the US?
* It's interesting how my envelopes from Staples are manufactured in 3 different places: UAE, India, and Vietnam.
* Lysol all purpose cleaner is made in Poland?!
* I'm glad that this year, we won't be buying a new car. But our next Subaru, which cost $40,000 last time, might be 20%, or $8,000 more!
* Next time we upgrade our iPhones, if it's made in China, a $799 phone would cost $1,438.
* My $500 glasses frames were made in Japan and next time I buy them, they may cost $100 more.
* My spouse buys lots of stuff from Lowe's that are not on the list.  A few months ago we built a new fence and I believe the lumber came primarily from Canada.
* Do the tariffs impact heating oil and gas prices? What about airplane travel?

1gi3e1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1gi3e1v/summary_of_my_long_covid_history/,Summary of My Long COVID History,"I wanted to share the comprehensive timeline of my health journey with those who might be interested. Honestly, I‚Äôm not the talkative type, and I‚Äôm not entirely sure why I‚Äôm sharing this‚Äîmaybe writing it down will help me think more clearly or make sense of everything. Anyway, here it is.

**2020‚Äì2021: The Start**

* While freelancing from home with minimal exposure to others, I unexpectedly developed serious lung issues. A visit to the doctor revealed *pneumonia* and *pleural effusion (fluid accumulation in the lungs)*. This came out of nowhere. I was prescribed treatment, and a couple of months later, COVID hit the news.
* Half a year later, the acute illness subsided, but I developed an extreme sensitivity to allergens like pollen and dust. My cough returned after being exposed to COVID-positive people at various events, but every test I took came back negative.

**First Diagnoses and Treatments**

* Further medical visits revealed nodules in my lungs and a diagnosis of allergic asthma. I was prescribed different allergy medications and inhalers (including disc-type ones), which I used as prescribed.
* In 2022 my cough worsened after frequent contact with crowded environments and COVID-positive people. This led to more antibiotics and inhaler prescriptions. Once again, COVID tests were negative, but I saw some temporary improvement.
* At the same time, I was exercising intensely, pushing myself daily.

**Vaccination and Downhill Spiral**

* Things began to unravel after I took the Pfizer mRNA shot, receiving only the first dose. Initially, I experienced no side effects, but about a week later, I developed bloating, stomach cramps, and muscle twitches. My focus started slipping, I had hearing problems, and I noticed a clear cognitive decline. I was confused and blamed my diet and weight.

**Lifestyle Changes and Temporary Relief**

* Determined to fix things, I changed my lifestyle and lost 30 kg (66 lbs) by starting with a 15-day water fast. During the fast, all my symptoms disappeared. I then transitioned to six months of strict ketosis: no sugar, alcohol, energy drinks, coffee, salt, fried food, or oil. My weight dropped to 76 kg (168 lbs), but the symptoms gradually returned.
* At the end of 2023, despite scoring well in a hearing test, I struggled to comprehend speech properly‚Äîit felt like hearing words but not processing them.

**2024 Medical Investigations**

* An internal medicine consultation showed an infection and hormonal imbalances in my bloodwork. Suspecting my lungs, I went through thorough checks, which revealed perfectly healthy lungs with no nodules or signs of asthma. I was baffled when my doctor couldn‚Äôt explain how my allergic asthma had seemingly vanished.
* Visits to a gastroenterologist were met with initial skepticism, but I insisted on an endoscopy and colonoscopy due to frequent bathroom visits (up to 4 times a day). The results showed an infection in my small bowel, chronic gastritis, and a 1-inch ulcer. Despite no detected bacteria or viruses (biopsy), medication cleared the infection, and my restroom habits returned to once a day. Yet, many other symptoms persisted.
* I also visited an eye doctor for my impaired vision. My eye prescription remained the same, but the doctor noted that my oil glands were clogged and my tear glands were tiny, producing very little tear. He prescribed steroid-antibiotic eye drops. I had never experienced a problem like this before, and despite using the prescribed medication as directed, my vision problems have remained unchanged.

**Lingering and New Symptoms**

* Skin issues: lesions, comedones, oily skin, and reactions that make me wash my face up to 5 times daily.
* Eye problems: red veins around the sclera, occasional blurry vision, temporary shaky vision, needing eye drops three times a day.
* Cognitive issues: declining attention span, quick disinterest in complex tasks.
* Chronic fatigue, loss of ambition and pleasure, and constant tinnitus (a ‚Äútssss‚Äù sound that never stops).
* Persistent neck and head pressure, joint pain (especially in the shoulders), random muscle and vein twitches (e.g., neck to chin, temples, eyelids), stiff neck.
* Stomach cramps, random heart racing during sleep, and sudden chest stinging.
* Forgetfulness and difficulty multitasking, whether on the computer, speaking, or navigating outside; ""stalling"" when tasks suddenly change or become complicated during a steady event.

**Notable Observations: Changes from 2020 to 2024**

* Methylphenidate, once effective for my ADHD with no side effects, now triggers severe side effects like heart pain, blurred vision, shaky hands, and stomach cramps.
* Wellbutrin caused a severe panic attack for the first time in my life during an important event, something I had never experienced before.
* I used to drink bottles of milk and consume dairy products weekly, but now I am suddenly lactose intolerant for no apparent reason.
* I used to eat processed foods, junk food, and fast food without any issues. Now, even a small packaged cake makes me bloated, almost as if I can‚Äôt tolerate any preprocessed food. Even pasta affects me negatively, while only white rice seems to have no impact.
* Immunace vitamins help slightly (5‚Äì7%), depending on deficiencies.
* In the early years, energy drinks and coffee initially helped clear my mind but worsened my stomach over time.
* In the early years, painkillers and muscle relaxers were beneficial at first but led to worsening issues.
* Ketosis improved my baseline significantly (30‚Äì40% improvement) by reducing exhaustion and improving resilience, but many long COVID symptoms persisted.
* Piracetam helped memory (\~10% improvement), while other supplements like lion‚Äôs mane, ginseng, gingko, bromelain, and L-tyrosine offered small gains (5‚Äì7%).
* Water fasting was the most effective (60‚Äì70% symptom relief), likely due to autophagy, but it isn‚Äôt sustainable once I dropped below a certain weight.

**Final Thoughts & Frustration**

I can't shake the feeling that authorities knew more than they let on and suppressed dissent regarding the vaccine's potential risks. Doctors seem aware of the issues but without solutions, they move on, leaving people like me as collateral damage. Watching honest discussions from doctors now is infuriating, as more transparency at the start might have kept me from taking the shot.

Right now, what I struggle with most is stalling. When I'm staring at a PC screen‚Äîwhether it's an article to read, a game to play, a video, or a work-related task, it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs entertaining or not‚Äîthe moment my brain decides that it‚Äôs overwhelming, it shuts my attention down. If I push myself to focus, my vision gets blurry, and my eyes lock into a stall state, staring at corners. Then I grab my phone and lay down on the couch, starting to scroll. I guess my brain is looking for constant dopamine somehow. What‚Äôs interesting to me is that before COVID, when I needed quick dopamine, music, junk food, opening the window for fresh air, having a short walk, or a hot shower always helped, and I could stay focused for 1-2 hours more. Now I can't even focus for 10 minutes, and it's destroying my life. The feeling is like when you dive underwater; everything gets slower, blurrier, and harder to process. I‚Äôm in a constant state like this. When I look in the mirror, I see a dementia patient. I know my true self is in there somewhere, but no matter what I do, I can't ""activate"" it.

So, the last year has been spent going to doctor appointments, trying to find a cure, shuffling through supplements, and learning AI and stable diffusion very slowly to keep myself busy. But I‚Äôm not doing anything seriously productive, and I can‚Äôt keep living like this forever.

I plan to see an endocrinologist next, followed by a neurologist if necessary. If all else fails, I‚Äôm even considering ECT to reset my brain and forget who I was before. Unfortunately, my reality is that I‚Äôm very pessimistic about these doctors finding a cure. From my point of view, when I read their body language, they seem pretty much aware of what's going on, as if something is amiss. But because there is no specific protocol for this or a cure, they play along and offer generic advice like ""exercise, take a rest, take a chill pill.""

From Big Pharma's perspective, a cure is not profitable since long COVID patients are not a majority. And from the government‚Äôs perspective, accepting the vaccine‚Äôs long-term damages would mean admitting they caused harm knowingly, which could lead to questions about whether people like me were disabled on purpose.

I'm Emin :)
I'm 24, and looking for some friends in Berlin. I'm living here already for 2 years, but so far I have not really had any time to go out and meet new people. 

If you are a female/male around my age, who speaks English, Russian or Turkish, likes to ride around the city and discover new places, eat d√∂ner and have discussions on different topic, or enjoy three-four cups of coffee per day: let's meet!

Originally, I am from Kazakhtsan, Almaty. I grew up there, and then finished my studies in Northern Cyprus and Ankara. I work full time, but I have a very flexible schedule and like to go driving around the city. I live in Marienfelde with my girlfriend and my dalmatian dog, so I really would love to distract myself a bit in the city center or even around Berlin. 

By profession I'm an Aerospace engineer, I work in Wildau. I also teach academic English in my free time. I like gardening, going to the gym, learning languages and having discussions on various topics.

Hit me up if you want to hang out! I would be happy to meet :)",3,1730572917.0,berlinsocialclub,0,1.0,False

1gi35qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/aisalescopy/comments/1gi35qy/the_surprising_truth_about_using_an_ai/,The Surprising Truth About Using an AI Copywriting Tool,"Quick story...

It started as most of my writing sessions do: with a cup of lukewarm coffee teetering on the edge of my desk and a heavy, mocking silence hanging between me and my laptop screen.

The blank page stared back, a void daring me to fill it with something, anything.

The stakes were high‚Äîclients waiting, deadlines tight.

But the words, they felt like marbles, rolling around in my head without purpose.

I leaned back, eyeing the bookshelves lined with half-finished notebooks, each one an echo of past creative struggles.

And then, out of nowhere, like remembering a song you haven‚Äôt heard in years, it hit me.

A few weeks back, during a networking event that felt as stale as day-old popcorn, someone mentioned **AI copywriting software**.

It wasn‚Äôt just a passing remark, either‚Äîit was delivered with the fervor of a convert who'd just discovered fire.

The name AI Copy Cub came up, murmured with a nod as if it held secret powers

 At the time, I‚Äôd dismissed it as another gimmick.

After all, how could a program do what I, with my hard-won experience and caffeine-driven stubbornness, struggled to accomplish?

But now, with my cursor blinking like a taunt, I figured, why not?

I typed in ""best AI software for copywriting"" into the search bar and watched as suggestions flooded the screen like ants at a picnic.

One headline caught my attention: ""Write sales copy with AI in minutes!""

The skepticism rose, warm and familiar, but so did curiosity. 

Opening the AI Copy Cub homepage of felt like cracking open a mystery novel at midnight.

I watched the demo and created an account, no frills, no hesitation‚Äîjust a desperate need for words.

The interface was clean - it was still in beta - and within moments, I was staring at a prompt box with the intensity of someone hoping for a magic trick.

I typed in my request, something vague about needing an engaging introduction, and hit what they call the ""magic button.""

Seconds later, there it was: a series of sentences that made me blink in surprise.

They were sharp, almost cheeky, with a rhythm that hummed with potential. (But don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt perfect. A few lines were stilted, mechanical, but it was something, and something was better than nothing.)

I shifted in my chair, the old wooden thing creaking like it was sharing my excitement.

I leaned in, tweaking phrases, adding my touch, but it felt less like slogging through a swamp and more like sculpting clay. It hit me that the best AI copywriting tools weren‚Äôt here to replace me‚Äîthey were here to make me faster, sharper, like a marathon runner using energy gels to push that last mile.

Somewhere in the whirlwind of edits, the thought bubbled up: *is AI copywriting worth it*?

That, I‚Äôd soon find out.

The output improved with every prompt, adapting as if it had been listening to the voice in my head.

It wasn‚Äôt flawless.

There were moments when it sputtered out sentences that felt like they belonged in a college essay or broke character with phrases that felt as artificial as a mannequin smile.

But each round of generation brought me closer to the final draft, and that alone made my heart knock a little louder with relief.

It wasn‚Äôt just me noticing the shift, either. A week later, a client emailed, gushing over a campaign draft‚Äîwords like ‚Äúpunchy‚Äù and ‚Äúmagnetic‚Äù jumped out from the screen.

They asked me, ‚ÄúHow did you manage this so quickly?‚Äù

I stared at the question, fingers paused above the keyboard, and a grin twitched at the corner of my mouth. Oh, if they only knew the secret weapon humming quietly behind the scenes.

Still, AI isn‚Äôt a golden goose.

It‚Äôs more like that friend who shows up with great advice but occasionally forgets your birthday.

The generated copy sometimes felt flat, or a little too ‚Äòperfect‚Äô in a way that lacked that human lilt, that raw edge.

I‚Äôd tweak sentences, add in an unnecessary ellipsis for drama (because why not?) or shift the structure entirely to throw in a tangent.

That‚Äôs where the human touch came in, the messy, beautiful chaos of real writing.

And yes, the notion that you can write sales copy with AI sorta sounds like a pitch from a sci-fi movie, but with platforms like the one I found at [aicopycub.com](http://aicopycub.com), it‚Äôs real‚Äîand weirdly, it‚Äôs fun.

You feed it a simple idea and watch it spin, sometimes sputter, like a toddler learning to talk.

You give it direction, nudge it when it veers off-track, and suddenly, there‚Äôs a paragraph that almost sings.

Not all tools were created equal, though. I flirted with a few others‚ÄîJasper, Writesonic‚Äîbut AI Copy Cub kept me hooked.

It was like choosing between coffee shops: sure, they all offer caffeine, but one just knows how to get the foam right on your latte.

The best AI copywriting tools will do that‚Äîmatch your style, learn your quirks.

Of course, some days, I wondered if it was cheating, a bit like having GPS tell you where to go when you could just pull out an old map.

But then I‚Äôd think of the grind, the relentless task of stringing words when my brain felt like a fried circuit. 

The real art was in the edit, in shaping what the AI gave me and pushing it into something uniquely mine.

So, if you really want to know... is AI copywriting worth it?

If you‚Äôre looking for an extra set of hands‚Äîor, rather, a set of circuits‚Äîthat can give you a head start, then yes, with a capital Y. 

ust don‚Äôt expect it to be your muse.

That‚Äôs still your job.

The best writing will always come from that tangle of nerves and dreams inside your head, but with a bit of help, that journey to the perfect paragraph just got a whole lot shorter.

And if you want to boost your writing and connect with your audience instantly, I suggest you check out the AI copywriting tool that creates the exact ‚Äúbuying words‚Äù your prospect needs to hear‚Äîin seconds.

We‚Äôve been good friends for almost two years now and spent a lot of time together. (We were college buds and reconnected online some time ago.) We play video games together, I hang out with him, his bother and their friend group, and I also host movie nights as well. 

He knows I‚Äôm gay and used to join D&D sessions at my
ex‚Äôs place. Ever since I became single back in February, we‚Äôve been spending more time together and hanging out. He doesn‚Äôt have a 9-to-5 job and makes some money helping his dad out with landscaping. As a kind gesture, I‚Äôve bought him a couple video games over the summer and recently got him a pair of socks that he saw at the store. (He‚Äôs been trying to watch his spending.) 

Honestly, I‚Äôve started developing feelings for him. We have similar interests, get along well, could talk for hours, he‚Äôs my type physically, etc. But I‚Äôve always kept a lid on it and never expressed that aloud. I value his friendship above all else and wouldn‚Äôt want to jeopardize that. 

Recently, he invited me to the gym a couple weeks ago and he‚Äôs been my ‚Äútrainer,‚Äù so to speak. He also brings me along as a guest so I don‚Äôt have to pay. He‚Äôs super nice and I‚Äôve talked to him about my ex, a couple dates I‚Äôve been on that haven‚Äôt worked out, etc. He never directly brings up his own dating life, but I know he‚Äôs single and hasn‚Äôt dated in a long time. He has a couple friends who tend to disrespect his time by showing up super late to gym workouts, don‚Äôt answer his texts, don‚Äôt hit him up to see how he‚Äôs doing, etc.

Long story short, I surprised him with some Halloween candy to share with his family. I also throw in some mocha coffee he likes since it was on sale. He was a bit taken aback at first, but gave me a hug and said thank you. I told him that I appreciated him and his efforts to hang out, let me work out with him, etc. Just expressing my gratitude. The convo seemed fine and we moved on to other subjects.

The next day, he texted me that the gift giving needs to stop. And he said I‚Äôm a cool dude, but felt that I was putting him in a weird place with the gifts and telling him I appreciated his companionship. He said that he‚Äôs straight and only figured I must have feelings for him to do this. He specifically said, ‚ÄúMy friends don‚Äôt do this.‚Äù 

I told him that I got where he was coming from, but I didn‚Äôt meant to cross any boundaries or put him in a weird spot. I also said I can struggle with showing appreciation for folks without overdoing it, but I appreciated him being upfront with me. Now today, after I asked if we were still cool, he told me that I‚Äôm a good friend, he was sorry for taking a while to reply, and that we can still be friends. 

Any advice on how I should approach things? Maybe he‚Äôs not used to friends showing gratitude and appreciation? Granted, I *do* like him, but I see him as a good friend first and foremost. I like to give small gifts for people if they‚Äôre platonic friends or otherwise.  

TL;DR: Straight friend felt uncomfortable with small gifts I gave to show appreciation, thinking I might have feelings for him. I apologized, and then he said I‚Äôm a good friend and wants to keep things going. Any advice on moving forward?",1,1730572588.0,askgaybros,3,1.0,False

At most we meet up for lunch or coffee every few months, and we never really saw eye to eye on a lot of things. Despite all this, I thought we had a positive, if just distant, relationship.

I always knew she leaned red growing up, and being very aware of the political differences between her and my father, a leftist and the one I lived with full time (my mother had me every other weekend). But I felt that, between the two of them, I could get a healthy dose of both sides, something I could pride myself in on hearing out everyone.

The first time I could vote was 2020, and I had voted for Biden, as the MAGA rhetoric was picking up, and having recently stepped out of the closet, it had made me nervous. I would later find out my mother participated in Jan. 6. We got into a pretty nasty argument and stopped talking for a while, though eventually went back to status quo. 

A couple weeks ago, we met up for coffee again, and the topic eventually did turn to politics. Not only was she voting for Trump, claiming that MAGA actually isn't about racism, but purely economy, and because I align myself as leftist but not Democrat, many Democrats would think I'm an evil Republican, and that the COVID shots had potentially made me sterile. 

My youngest siblings on my mom's side aren't vaccinated. All four of my siblings living with my mom are being home schooled, and while I understood why the other two siblings were, since they were being bullied for being on the spectrum, I do not think my mom nor her husband have the capability to give them a good education, though I'm praying to be proven wrong. When I explained to her that it doesn't matter if Trump doesn't openly endorse Project 2025, there's enough people in his circle that do and/or participated in making it, and despite knowing that I'm NB, and recognizing that P2025 does imply capital punishment for ""transgenderism,"" she doesn't believe it would actually happen.

I've realized I'm starting to resent her, I've started to think her as stupid, though I hate typing that out, since she was one of the few on my maternal side that accepted me coming out. Her actions are going to hurt her kids, and her vote could potentially hurt millions more.

My husband said hey let‚Äôs go vote and get some breakfast. I said ok and started to get ready. I was feeling weird shaky legs which is usually first thing in the morning before I hydrate. 

I showered got dressed even put makeup on. I started to plan ahead. I said one are going to be standing in line for awhile let me take a propranolol. I fixed myself a cup of coffee, downed a bottled water and a water with some hydrate in it. 

We got to the voting site which was a library. We stood in line for about 30 minutes. It wasn‚Äôt too bad other than the fact that it was very hot outside. I also noticed I‚Äôm the only one that can‚Äôt stand still I have to rock back and forth and I look like an emo. I have tried standing still to appear normal and I‚Äôm honestly just not comfortable me so I sway because it somehow makes me feel better. 

We vote then go out to breakfast. I start getting a horrible migraine so I get my food to go. I‚Äôm not sure if the propranolol caused the headache, it usually doesn‚Äôt. 

I took a maxalt at about noon and it takes the migraine away. 

I checked my blood pressure this morning and it was 119/89. 

I checked it at about 2pm and it was 99/75, a side effect of the propranolol is that it lowers blood pressure.

I have very bad anxiety when it comes to pets, so I was hoping someone could offer advice, reassurance, anything. ",1,1730571776.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False

1gi2srr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gi2srr,DIY aged potion bottles for my witch cottage. Close ups and how to. ,"Someone asked for more pics/info on these so I figured I‚Äôd add a detailed step by step if anyone wanted it. 

Top row: Welch‚Äôs grape juice bottle, glass Starbucks frap bottle, and the other two are bottle from Michael‚Äôs (like $2 each) 

Bottom row: Starbucks bottle, bread crumb container, J√§egermeister bottle (I liked the green and figured kids wouldn‚Äôt notice üòÖ), Starbucks bottle, minced garlic container. Also used some glass sauce jars not shown in this picture. 

The Starbucks bottle and bread crumb container I spray painted on the outside. Though I‚Äôd recommend that for anything cardboard, definitely don‚Äôt recommend for glass. It ends up chipping off very easily. 

For the other containers, I mixed black and/or green acrylic paint with a bit of water. Enough water so that it‚Äôs easy to pour, but not too too thin. Each container only needs one or two tablespoons of the mix. I poured it into the container, swirled it around so that it was on all of the sides, and dumped out the excess. Then, while it‚Äôs still wet, take dry dirt from outside and sprinkle it onto the wet paint. It helps the paint dry in place and gives it a dried out/evaporated look while still holding color. Make sure the dirt is ground up and very fine, not chunky. Without the dirt, I was never able to get the paint to coat the inside of the container like I wanted. It would always drip down and be too thin/transparent. 

I also found powder that glows under black light and experimented with that a bit. I tried mixing it with clear glue and mixing it with slime. Those were all difficult and messy and the effect was not great on any combination of them. The best luck I had was sprinkling the powder directly onto the wet paint just like I did with the dirt. It shined the brightest, was the easiest to execute, and gives me no concern with it reacting weirdly to changing temperatures while it‚Äôs stored or on display (I live in the Midwest and my Halloween decor is stored in a shed. It needs to stand up to temps anywhere from 0-100 degrees). 

For the outside, some bottles are tied with twine on top. Some I used wax and wax stamps. The wax I got on Amazon and is shaped like a hot glue gun stick. You use it in a hot glue gun. This is something you can‚Äôt leave sitting in a hot glue gun while you work, it has to be done right away or it drips out of every crevice of the gun!! Definitely needs its own designated glue gun because of the residual it leaves behind inside. It doesn‚Äôt seem to damage the glue gun tho and dried quickly which was a plus. For things I didn‚Äôt save the lids for (the Starbucks bottles and bread crumb containers) I just cut down cardboard to size, painted it black with the acrylic/water mix and glued on a wood bead with a flat bottom and round top. Then glued the cardboard to the container. 

All of the bottles were sprayed with hairspray and then sprinkled with dry dirt from the garden to make them look dusty. Did a few coats as needed and then sprayed one last time with hair spray to get it to stick. Make sure you sprinkle the dirt from above to get a realistic dust effect. Most of these were made this year, but I had a couple I did 3 years ago that have held up wonderfully since I made them. Hairspray is surprisingly effective adhesive in this situation! 

For the labels, I cheaped out and bought a sticker pack off amazon. The downside of that was that they were all pretty small, I had to cut off the white boarders, and some were definitely AI generated and made no sense. For the ones I made a few years ago, I printed them out, crumpled them up a bit, and used coffee grounds to age them and then glued them on (the poison one in the top middle is one of those labels). I would definitely recommend going this route instead. 

There‚Äôs a few bottles that I tried to fill with what the label said they had. One was pine needles, cat whiskers (I had some floral with whisker looking bits I cut off), crow feathers, and dead fingers (finger sized sticks I painted white to look like bones). I didn‚Äôt go to this length for all of them, but it was fun to add a few with these extra touches.

I cannot begin got fathom what I've heard today. He texted me saying he wanted to meet me. Since I had some previous commitments I told him I would be busy to which he said this could wait for later. Eventually I did meet him after spending time to take a bath, dress up and head over for coffee. Only to be sat down and told last night I visited her place, got drunk and ended up sleeping with each other. 

To give you context I feel I have a huge chutiya written on my forehead. While I was angry and frustrated calling him all shit that he is I asked him if he would stop seeing this woman to which he said I'll meet her but I won't sleep with her. 

And later than our salvage didn't matter much when it came to her and that she will always be more important to him. 

He always kept telling me I had nothing to worry about and that it was over but she will always remain an important part of his life. To the extend that I met her in person over dinner. The audacity of both of them. 

After sex she says she was taken advantage of by him. What the fuck are you a minor who doesn't understand consent?

I have always been in loving relationships where I've been wanted. And I somehow end up with this absolute shit piece of a human being. I ended up texting his gf letting her know that he is all hers. ",78,1730571509.0,TwoXIndia,30,0.92,False

So..... Idk if I'm a reader or not, i mean i do read(every once in a while) but not that much. The thing is idk if I'm qualified enough to be called a reader or if sometimes i can't even stick to one book. I'm not posting this in r/PakistanBookClub bcz well its related to other things too. Idk wt the issue is but i have a very short attention span, I've read a book of almost 1100 pages in 8 hours and I've read a 82 page book in 1 year (no other books that year). 

Also my interest keep jumping from one thing to another and i keep researching stuff that doesn't even makes sense like there are days i read random stuff till 4 and there are days where i can't even move and am lazy af scrolling,and also like ik palmistry but not that much just basic (like top 5 relationship line, career lines, romantic line, health line  etc). Not interested in doing for anyone and YES IT IS HARAM IN ISLAM. I just love to put my nose in different things just to chck them out and see how much truth exists. Also i know basic numerology (enough to know its haram and there's conflict if abjad system is halal or not). I started coding did the courses on coursea finished them but know nothing coz also i have memory span of dory. Forget details in an hour and sometimes remember things for lifetime, i also know brain enough to tell u which harmone or which part of ur brain is responsible for which thing. I also learned about the dark side of spells and djinns and how there's contradiction as if only djinns exist or other creatures exist too(never dwell in it, too afraid of consequences of Islam and of ofc everything that can go wrong) read a bunch of books on Muslim scientists too. Also i was called an alien by my class fellow bcz of how much things ik about the world yet still i barely pass at uni and idk how to feel about that too. I also can't keep my thoughts coherent but psychologist and psychiatrist cleared me out (the best ones in isb). 

I also knw about hypnosis, i can name 5 galaxies pretty easily, i have average iq(near to 98) also i just had 10th cup of coffee rn. I also know ratios of stuff like how much ppl have MS, Huntington and some other genetic diseases 

And whatever ik about the things i mentioned and the things i didn't are basically just introductory stuff, like i can talk about any of those topics for just 2 hours max but after that i stopped studying about them
