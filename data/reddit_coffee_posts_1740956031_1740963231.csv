1j26g6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/lookingforfriendship/comments/1j26g6p/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1740963109.0,lookingforfriendship,0,1.0,False

Exmo from Brazil here. Today I caught myself wondering what the church does to avoid the cultural faux-pas of declining a cup of coffee in Brazil. For exemple: when the missionaries were visiting me, they would always be received in the front door first by my mom with cake, cheese bread, cookies aaaand‚Ä¶ coffee. My mother never did it for a bad reason, it‚Äôs just a cultural thing where we live. You offer your visits a lot of food and coffee. And it‚Äôs a faux-pas to refuse. After I explained to her that they didn‚Äôt drink coffee, she started offering them juice, but I always felt she was never interested in the church mainly because it started off with this coffee issue (and I mean it. She didn‚Äôt want to read the Book of Mormon and only really agreed to attend a couple sacramental meetings - that‚Äôs how we say in english? - with me. Smart woman). Before you ask, for me it was easy: I was sick in the hospital for months when I first talked to the missionaries and coffee and wasn‚Äôt really my priority then.

After I left the church recently, I was talking to a coworker that commented that a coworker of ours was a mormon and it was the weirdest thing how she didn‚Äôt drink coffee ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no excuse to don‚Äôt drink it!

1j26dhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1j26dhx/all_where_did_the_guard_go/,[All] Where did the guard go?,"In Return's opening episode, some Sam had been tasked with watching a glass box if anything appeared inside. The box was in a warehouse up a New York City highrise. A passcode was needed to access the location. In the lobby where the elevator was, there was a guard at all times.

When some Tracey came to see Sam for the second time, the guard was mysteriously gone. They looked for him but there was no trace.

>Sam: ""Weird. Where is he?""

So, *where* was he? And *how* weird would the reason be?

Earlier, when Tracey came for the first time and the guard was still there, she was carrying **two cups of coffee** which she left for Sam. Clearly, she had the intention they would enjoy the drinks together but the guard didn't let her go in. Everything was top secret. Sam took the cups, went in, sat down and started drinking from one of the cups. 

Sam gave the coffee an approving look. Clearly, Tracey knew what he liked. This was probably the regular he usually had.

[They met over coffee.](https://preview.redd.it/xxyif4sradme1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=906d5211fd4a253d5ddae93947fa0ea70058ceb7)

Later in P6, some Miriam also got **two cups of coffee**. She was chatting with Shelly and Heidi in the RR Diner.

>Miriam: ""Oh, hey, can I get two cups of coffee to go? One decaf for me and one regular for *one of the moms* who loves Double R coffee?""

She then left carrying two cups on a tray, as if challenging us to find the connection to Tracey who appeared in the New York lobby with another tray that had two cups of coffee on it. Both women would have had a cup for themselves while the other was for ""one of the moms"" and Sam, respectively.

Miriam's cups were seen last when she locked eyes with Richard driving past in a truck. He was coming from a crossroads where he had accidentally hit a little boy. The boy had run to the pedestrian crossing just as Richard was speeding through. 

There were a lot of people in the crossroads, but Miriam wasn't one of them. By the time Richard and her saw each other, he was already far away from the site of the accident. She couldn't have known what had just happened. Regardless of that, something was going on between them.

[It was the crossroads he needed to watch.](https://preview.redd.it/0ulzcts0bdme1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be23df2cee9bf8284958578dcde0d1039731d3dd)

A crossroads has the shape of a large letter X. There was also a large X in Sam's warehouse, holding together the glass roof of the central box that he needed to keep staring. Thus, **both Richard and Sam were coming from an ""X""** when they saw the woman with a tray that had two cups of coffee.

Another hint suggested the same. Because several cars had lined up at the crossroads, just waiting there, and agitated Richard moved to the left lane to pass them. On the lane, there was ""SCHOOL"" written in large white letters. That meant Richard was coming to the crossroads from the direction of a school that was somewhere behind him.

[Coming from school to watch the X.](https://preview.redd.it/2d9u5i9fbdme1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12e8e45fd2f5fc96f2bb24a87bbb2e67bf645bcc)

School was where Sam was supposedly spending his days before coming to stare at the glass box and the X on top of it, like he explained to Tracey.

>Sam: ""It's just a job I got to help with *school*.""

Richard sitting in the truck and Sam on the sofa, both looking at a large X and coming from school seem to have been *the same situation* and these two men *the same character*. This would imply that ***when Richard and Miriam saw each other, the story jumped to Sam and Tracey meeting in the lobby***, from the last shot of Miriam's cups to the first shot of Tracey's.

[Watch it!](https://preview.redd.it/jsdo2yvdcdme1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c567a41dd0da92077abd35d155a461c03f9c8a8)

Since the crossroads already seems to have been [an illusion created by the Black Lodge waiting room](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1izsqey/all_wrapped_in_plastic/), this would make *the New York warehouse yet another incarnation of the same place*, used as the rationale for extreme transitions and transformations of locations and the characters in them. 

The real mystery would have been who these people really were and why they had got stuck in the Lodge. Acting as a kind of dreamscape, the lodge would have kept throwing them from one story to another. In each new life, they would have been cast as seemingly independent characters whose fates would nevertheless echo the underlying main plot, like our daily lives tend to creep into our dreams. But this time it was all real - although dying in Lynch's Dreamland might have been just a change.

For Richard / Miriam to have turned into Sam / Tracey, Sam's cup of coffee should find its way to the one Miriam didn't get for herself, the cup for ""one of the moms"". What this was supposed to mean was hinted shortly before all hell broke loose in the usually silent warehouse. 

[You have the right to remain one of the mums.](https://preview.redd.it/j8swgeylcdme1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c00bc7820233bbc1f7bec13c91d8d4ff00132490)

While Sam and Tracey were making out, something materialised in the glass box. Sam noticed it, asked Tracey to *stop* and then hushed her to keep *quiet*.

Later in the same episode, some William Hastings was arrested by Detective Macklay. We didn't get to hear the accusation but the detective reminded Hastings of his rights.

>Macklay: ""You have the right to remain *silent*.""

Another word for silent is *mum*, pronounced the same as ""mom"" and also the British spelling for the same word. If you choose to remain silent, you remain mum, making you *one of the mums*.

Assuming then that Sam's character was later arrested after another series of abrupt transitions, the cup meant for him would have been the *regular* one. Another kind of regular is a *soldier* for which another word is a *private*.

[The \\""regular\\"" and how he disappeared.](https://preview.redd.it/w084gkfvcdme1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7337074b650af29cf21c123bb677052232482951)

When we got a closeup of the guard in the lobby, we could see there was text written on his shoulder patch, saying, ""PRIVATE SECURITY OFFICER"". Of the three words, ""PRIVATE"" was turned towards the camera. 

The ""regular"" for ""one of the mums"" might not only have been *the cup of coffee* but also *the guard* watching that no one got to Sam who had the right to remain mum because he was going to be accused of a crime. Sam getting the coffee and the guard would have been the same thing.

This would then become an explanation for the guard's disappearance. **When Sam drank his regular coffee, he also drank the private guard**. Thus, the guard was not in the lobby anymore because he was in Sam's stomach. 

Weird, yes. But Sam told us it would be.

As usual, however, even if ideas presented here had been figured out as intended, at least in principle, the story probably was not this, uh, ""straightforward"".

[Wouldn't have happened without the other trucker.](https://preview.redd.it/izhld7a0edme1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f4b2429d25f8e32538c2d3cce7cce7bc95eb598)

Richard's truck was not the only truck in the crossroads. There was also *another*, a larger one, a Volvo parked right next to the pedestrian crossing. Unwittingly, its uncredited driver played a part in the accident by gesturing the mother and the boy to step forward to the road. Also he was alone in the car, sitting there and watching the crossroads. 

As it seemed, neither the nameless trucker or Richard ever meant to harm the boy - yet, together they got him killed. Going forward, one would have been accused of the killing while the other could have felt equally guilty, seeing some terrifying nightmares.

[Let's electrify this place with an X right here.](https://preview.redd.it/sfgtofa6edme1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=452ac55a56d1efcf6d90805ac35c40972a032661)

As for why there would have been a large X in the Black Lodge waiting room, we probably need to think about the character's general use as **the symbol for a kiss**. That would have been the odd kiss the Laura lookalike woman, who felt like she had known her, gave to Cooper first in E2 and then again in P2.",1,1740962890.0,twinpeaks,0,1.0,False

She even asked me to get her coffee a few times, which I did. She was happy and talkative when I did, but she never said thanks. This past week, she didn't ask for coffee, so I just drove her to work and she was extremely hostile and glued to her phone the entire time. On Friday, I told her, ""Have a good weekend!"" She slammed the door without a word.

That bothered me, so I texted her saying I don‚Äôt mind driving but need respect. Today, she texted me and claimed she never asked for rides (even though she did ask once) and would walk from now on. I told her I‚Äôd just appreciate kindness all the time, not just when she wants coffee. I said she is capable of being nice because I have seen that side of her. I also said she can talk to me when she‚Äôs emotionally mature enough to do so (if she ever is). I also mentioned her need for God. Finally, I said I still care and wish her all the best and am rooting for her in this life.

Her response? ""Absolutely not. Don‚Äôt f***ing push your f***ing religion on me."" I said, ""Okay, I‚Äôll honor that. I desire peace."" She replied, ""F*** off."" I ended with, ""I don‚Äôt want to engage in hostility. I‚Äôm here if you ever want to talk calmly."" Her final words? ""F*** off.""

She isn‚Äôt the person she pretended to be at the start. She mirrored me, but now I know that isn't really her. She has borderline personality disorder which is why I have had so much compassion.

Sorry in advance for such a long post. 

I (35 - M) come from a large family. My mother the second oldest of 12, my father is the middle of 9. My parents separated when I was in 1^(st) grade. Growing up there was a lot of physical and mental abuse between my parents and directed at me by both of them. I lived primarily with my mother until one day at 9 years old. During this time my mother and I were at a party, while playing with other kids I pulled a muscle in my neck, I was screaming and crying saying I needed to go to the hospital. My mother gave me an Excedrin put me in the car and told me to stop crying then went back to party. She left me there for 3 hours. I cried the whole way home begging, she said no. I was not allowed to speak to bring it up to a doctor for 5 years until my mother had a new boyfriend with will call ‚ÄúS‚Äù who took me for a checkup and told me to tell. By then the damage was done and I now have a spinal deformity that causes pain constantly. Back to when I was 9, I was living with¬† my mother and her boyfriend at the time (we will call ‚ÄúB‚Äù) spent the night constantly. B constantly abused me, hitting me, making me drink a gallon of hot sauce, punching me but one day after school I was beaten by him worse than he had in the past. After he was done hitting me with a belt and threw me as hard as he could against walls, he held me up by my throat choking me while punching me in my face, then threw me on the ground held my arms down with his knees and continued to punch me in the nose. In that moment I made peace with the fact I was being beaten to death and that I would not leave that room alive. He tired out, and I was bleeding profusely from my nose, so he yelled at me to clean myself up. The next day at school I tried talking to my teachers and principle, but they were all busy and told me they could not talk to me despite physical signs of what I had gone through, so after school I walked to the sheriff‚Äôs department and reported it. The thing I remember most was a deputy looking at me dead serious saying ‚Äúwe are going to hook you up to a lie detector test and if you are lying you are in big trouble‚Äù. Thankfully the social worker came soon after and I was placed in foster care.

I was in foster care only 2 weeks before being placed with my father where physical abuse continued. After a couple years I was placed back in the custody of my mother where the physical abuse stopped. For brevity I won‚Äôt go into individual instances, but the abuse consisted of hitting me for no reason, throwing me on walls, making me eat food off the dirty floor. As I got older the mental games with my mother started. She convinced a psychiatrist I was bipolar and wanted me medicated but I ran track, and he refused as he said I could overdose. Looking back, I wonder if he could tell and was saying that so she would not pursue it further but did not have enough to report? She accused me of stealing her sex toys in front of my friends, and constantly told people behind my back that I was mentally unstable and dangerous, despite the only time I have put hands on anyone was when a kid in 7^(th) grade tried to fight me so I blocked his punches. When I was an adult but still living at home, my mother and I took a class at a local community college together. She was constantly telling me that I was not studying, or taking the class seriously. After the first quiz, I had the highest grade in the class, this upset her. On the drive home she said ‚Äúyou will NEVER get a better grade than me again‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt. She also refused to study with me, even though we lived together. Another time, she woke me up screaming at 11pm because a pillow fell of the couch, starting a huge fight. I was an adult when this happened and my mother abuse started to evolve back into attempting to be violent again but in a different way. She would often block my exit from a room, or try to get me in a corner, then be physical in a way that I would have to defend myself. Knowing the mind games she plays, I never went along with it, and would keep furniture between us when arguing. That night she did it again, but I made sure to stand with an exit out of the house and keeping the couch and coffee table between us. After she could not get close to me, she called 911 crying saying that she was in fear for her life. She gave the cops the description of me being a big muscular black man. (My mother is half black, half white, very fair skinned, my father is black. So I am much darker than her). You can guess why she did this.

My father basically stopped talking to me after I placed back into my mother‚Äôs custody. As I mentioned I have a lot of aunts and uncles, so where were they when all this happened? Most lived in the same metropolitan area as us. In fact my fathers other brother lived in the house next to my mothers, I could see into his living room from my bed. He would often have family parties and I was never invited, so a couple times as a teenage I just went over but it was made clear by how I was treated I was not welcome so I just went back home, next door and tried to drown out the sounds of the music, talking, and laughing. I would constantly see my father going over there and even when I was outside he would not speak to me. It became a game, when I had frineds over, if my dad was over, I would show them my father walking down the street.

I also would constantly call my mother siblings begging them to let me come stay with them but they always said no. I was treated as the black sheep of the family. Only 1 time did one of my aunts (we will call her ‚ÄúK‚Äù showed up to court, that is when the abuse from B went to court and they were determining where I would live after foster care, if could be returned to my parents‚Äô care. After I was placed back into my mother‚Äôs custody, she told me K was there as an alternative if the court did not want to place me back with my parents. Years later I found out this was not true, we will return to this later.

At 25 I moved away to a new city hundreds of miles away and cut ties with most of my family. I had been in therapy and continued in my new city. This is when I learned what a narcissist is, and that my mother is most likely one. A few years after living away K passed away. I went home and stayed with an aunt for the funeral, we will call her M. While with her, she told me that all me my aunts and uncles knew of the abuse and that I had a horrible childhood. In the moment I felt seen and that I was not crazy. But as I proceeded over the proceeding days I realized they knew and told me know when I called them crying begging to live with them, so I ended up cutting off my entire family including my siblings.

A few years later at 31 I became very sick and needed surgery. The surgery did not go well, and I needed an additional 7 operations and was in the hospital for months at one point fed through a tube in my chest. A friend of mine who knew my family reached out to them against my wishes because he said I should not be in the hospital alone. I was not upset with him, but I told him, since you did this, you are required to watch what happens next. Immediately, my aunts and uncles start calling me, saying they will leave in the next couple days to come see me and to let them know if I need anything. After the initial day of calls and texts, it became a couple a week then nothing. None of them to let me know they were not actually coming to see me. Eventually after I was released from the hospital and doing better two aunts did come see me, M and another aunt we will call H. I cooked a huge lunch, was anxious but excited to see family. Within 10 minutes of them being there they are berating me about a decision I made. This decision was to adjust the terms of an agreement with a friend after that friend violated the agreement several times.

I got very upset and cut them off and told them I did not invite them into my home after I was released from the hospital for them to berate me. H got upset, started crying saying she was my aunt and I should show her respect. I let them know, they are guests in my house, if they don‚Äôt like how I am speaking or what I am saying they are welcome to leave but they will not continue to berate me in my own home. H went outside crying. M stayed and tried to get me to see it from their POV. I let her know, in so many choice words, I was already not happy with them, as they had said they were coming a few weeks earlier but never let me know plans had changed, I had to hear it from a cousin second hand they went to the mountains the same weekend they said they were coming to see me. M response was ‚Äúwe were actually stopping by on our way to visit your cousin‚Äù insinuating I should be grateful for the crumbs of attention given to me. She then proceeded to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not the only one going through a hard time right now, your aunt (H) is having a hard time too‚Äù. ¬†ATP I stopped talking to her and asked her to leave. Because I knew even then, without knowing what she was referring to, H had not just spent the last 3 months fighting for her life in the hospital. A couple years later, I found out what the hard time was, H lost her job. The reason was, she was a MFT at the VA seeing couples. She was seeing a couple, one of the two developed feelings, long story short, they got divorced and 5 years later my aunt was married to that person. This violated the VA rules as well as a ton of professional ethics.

After the incident where my mother called the cops on me for the pillow being on the ground, the next day she called over her brother. He came over with his wife, and him and I sat in my room talking for 3 hours, mostly telling him everything, no longer holding back or trying to protect anyone‚Äôs image. Now it is important to add her, when my mother was in her early 20‚Äôs she took in her sisters so they would not be abused by their parents, but while they lived with her, she was more abusive, often beating them until they bled, throwing them though windows and then turning around saying to them ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do that‚Äù when they would ask her why she was hitting them. I found this out from M when I went to K‚Äôs funeral. So before I was born it has been known my mother is abusive, and her siblings have experienced it. So back to the conversation with my uncle. After I spent hours telling him all the horrific things my mother had done. His only response was ‚Äúshe is your mother; you have to respect her and she can treat you how she wants‚Äù. I said okay, realizing there was no point in continuing. I then told him I was going to just pack my bags and leave. As I was packing, my mother came in started yelling at me, feeling empowered from my uncle I guess going outside and telling her what he said to me. She started shoving me while yelling trying to get me in a corner. I put my hands in the hair, walked backwards so I would not turn my back on her, and went to the back yard. I told my uncle that she is putting hands on me, and to please keep her outside while I pack and leave. He did, and I left. I would go on to sleep in a rental car and living with a meth addict while I got back on my feet financially.

I have always struggled to keep friendships as I have never been great at discerning the people that are good for me. Over the last year in therapy, I realized that because my family members are towering neon red flags, when someone has a small lighter shade of red flag, I dismiss it as its ‚Äúnot that big of a deal‚Äù. I also often recognize the way I was treated as a sign someone cares about me. I have and am still working through a lot of that but it has caused me to reevaluate every relationship I have.

¬†Through all this, I was able to become a first-generation college graduate with honors and started grad school last year. However I work from home most days, and my grad program was online asynchronous. This pulling back from social groups, working from home, and studying alone at home, has caused extreme isolation with no support group. So I withdrew from my grad program while I apply to other programs were I will be able to interact with others. Additionally my friend have never understood what I have gone through, and I realized earlier this year, I don‚Äôt have the same interests as them and I was hanging out with them out of familiarity but always leaving not feeling great about myself.

So, I am at a point in my life, I am 35, Bisexual & Biracial single with no real friends currently. My interest somehow have been too straight for my queer friends, but to gay for my straight friends. I am not some 6‚Äô2 ripped body gym obsessed guy, but I still work out, I just don‚Äôt care about abs. So I don‚Äôt have much luck dating. With Black folks I have shown interest in, comments are made that let me know I am too white and nonblack folks I get comments that let me know I‚Äôm too black or they are fetishizing me, wanting me to fit a fantasy of theirs. Without going into details, I have been sexually assaulted by 3 people I have dated or gone on dates with, once ended up in the hospital getting¬† a rape kit done. The only community I have to speak of, are the people I play COD with pretty much daily after work and on the weekends. I would like to go out, to bars, or museums, or events but right now the thought of people and being around them socially scares the shit out of me.

This is so very difficult because all I want is to have community, to have a chosen family of people who will fight for me. I am tired of fighting for my sanity and happiness alone. I would also love a partner to hold and to be held. I recently read a story here on Reddit about a group of women who went over to their friends house a week after she gave birth and forced their way into her home and then into the bathroom, she locked herself into because they knew she was going through something. I see my friends doing this for each other, but no one has ever cared enough for me to do anything close to that. I withdrew from the group chats on IG and iMessage and only told one person from the group why. I then told him, that him always having something with family come up when we have plans has contributed to me feeling isolated. When I say always, for the past 9 months we have made plans about twice a month to see each other, in that time we have seen each other 3 times.

Since pulling back socially, I have been working to build community and be intentional where I do it. I still am not at a place where I am comfortable meeting people in person since when I see someone socially, I feel like a burden, they only see me out of pity and I actually annoy them. In the past 5 years or so, I have stopped allowing friends to take pictures of me, as I feel like I ruin the picture and make it ugly, and they would be happier forgetting I was there with them.

I know therapy is a journey and it becomes hard at times, but this stretch I am in is really testing me. Logically I know doing the work will put me in a position to have healthier relationships but emotionally and the trauma I have experienced, tell me I will never be healthy enough mentally to have any kind of meaningful relationship with anyone and that it‚Äôs the kind thing to do for others is to just stay isolated for the rest of my days.

I was staring at a wall in silence on the verge of just crying needing to talk to someone but in my current situation‚Ä¶ so I decided to come here as this is what this Sub-Reddit is for. Being an adult survivor of abuse‚Ä¶ there really are no words for how difficult it is.

I would love a queer chosen family of people of all ages, genders, orientations where we spend holidays together, check in, and just be there for each other. I have always wanted  a friend I can go over and just sit in their room or house silently when I feel this way while they just do whatever. I once had a friend like that and it was very healing, until he did doing something unforgivable. It's the feeling that I am welcome enough they don‚Äôt need to cater to me as a guest, but also that my presence does not disrupt their life. Being the burden I was to my family, that is very much needed.

I am hoping one day I can find and build that community of a chosen family.

Anyways, if you made I this far, thank you for reading. I‚Äôm going to go nap then cook for the week or play COD, hopefully that will help my mood a bit.",1,1740962832.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

More recently, people have also told me that I look like I‚Äôm in my mid 30‚Äôs with kids. I want to add that for most of my life I didn‚Äôt wear sunscreen, and I started noticing the effect it had on my skin texture around the age of 15. I also have some hyperpigmentation that I began to notice about a year ago, probably due to that same reason. I‚Äôve also had acne problems but I‚Äôve been able to solve that for the most part.

one of my friends came over last night for a sleepover (we are both university students so i live in student accommodation). she ended up clogging my toilet in the morning while i was making coffee. no big deal, she told me and said she is waiting for the water to go down to use the plunger and try unclogging it. 

she had a bus pass valid till 30 more minutes (a new pass would take maximum 10 CAD) and she intended to catch the bus before that but the toilet hadn‚Äôt been unclogged yet. so she kept hinting at how she‚Äôll miss the bus if she doesn‚Äôt leave soon. after a while i got pretty tired and said ‚Äúif the mess isn‚Äôt too bad, you can leave i guess‚Äù, half hoping that she would stay up and clean after herself first. she jumped at this opportunity and said she would leave. mind you, she hasn‚Äôt apologized to me until this point. all she said was that she ‚Äúfeels bad‚Äù leaving it like this (then don‚Äôt???) 

fast forward to an hour, i tried to unclog it but it wasn‚Äôt working and i ended up spending 2+ hours getting it to work. basically, half of my sunday afternoon was spent here. 

i texted her telling her that it wasn‚Äôt fair and inconvenient. she chose not to reply to that text which angered me even more. so i ended up telling her that she wasn‚Äôt welcome in my home if this is how she is going to treat my space. 

i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs big enough to fight over, but cleaning up after someone‚Äôs smelly poop was not on my sunday to-do list!

one of my friends came over last night for a sleepover (we are both university students so i live in student accommodation). she ended up clogging my toilet in the morning while i was making coffee. no big deal, she told me and said she is waiting for the water to go down to use the plunger and try unclogging it. 

she had a bus pass valid till 30 more minutes (a new pass would take maximum 10 CAD) and she intended to catch the bus before that but the toilet hadn‚Äôt been unclogged yet. so she kept hinting at how she‚Äôll miss the bus if she doesn‚Äôt leave soon. after a while i got pretty tired and said ‚Äúif the mess isn‚Äôt too bad, you can leave i guess‚Äù, half hoping that she would stay up and clean after herself first. she jumped at this opportunity and said she would leave. mind you, she hasn‚Äôt apologized to me until this point. all she said was that she ‚Äúfeels bad‚Äù leaving it like this (then don‚Äôt???) 

fast forward to an hour, i tried to unclog it but it wasn‚Äôt working and i ended up spending 2+ hours getting it to work. basically, half of my sunday afternoon was spent here. 

i texted her telling her that it wasn‚Äôt fair and inconvenient. she chose not to reply to that text which angered me even more. so i ended up telling her that she wasn‚Äôt welcome in my home if this is how she is going to treat my space. 

i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs big enough to fight over, but cleaning up after someone‚Äôs smelly poop was not on my sunday to-do list!

But between soul-crushing routines and the 47th cat video your aunt sent you, feeling inspired feels like chasing a squirrel on espresso. Chill. I‚Äôve got zero-fluff strategies to kickstart your brain without waiting for a lightning bolt.

Stop Waiting for ‚ÄúThe Moment‚Äù (It‚Äôs a Trap)
Spoiler: That ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment in movies where the hero scribbles genius on a napkin? Lies. Inspiration loves consistency, not drama.

Try this: Brain dump for 5 mins every morning. Write anything‚Äîgrocery lists, rage about slow walkers. Ideas pop up when your guard‚Äôs down.
Pro hack: Follow weird Instagram accounts. Mushroom art? Niche history memes? Let algorithm chaos fuel you.
Your Environment is Sabotaging You
Trying to feel inspired in a room that looks like a laundry bomb exploded? Hard pass.

Glow-up move: Add one ‚Äúvibe‚Äù thing‚Äîa neon light, a plant named Steve, a poster of Dolly Parton staring into your soul.
Game-changer: Work in a new spot. Coffee shop? Park bench? Bathroom floor? Novelty = brain spark.
Consume Garbage (Yes, Really)
‚ÄúOnly read classics!‚Äù Nah. Watch bad reality TV. Scroll Etsy for crochet cryptids. Inspiration thrives on weird combos.

Example: ‚ÄùWhat if Selling Sunset‚Ä¶ but with aliens?‚Äù Boom. Story idea.
Guilty pleasure: Steal like an artist. Remix dumb stuff into your thing.
Movement > Meditation
Sitting cross-legged chanting ‚Äúom‚Äù isn‚Äôt for everyone. Shake your body instead.

Science says: Walking boosts creativity by 60%. Pretend you‚Äôre a detective solving a mystery. Ideas‚Äôll creep in.
Hack: Dance breaks. Blast Beyonc√©. Flail like no one‚Äôs watching (they‚Äôre not).
Embrace the Cringe
That voice saying ‚ÄùThis idea sucks‚Äù? Mute it. First drafts are supposed to be trash.

Mantra: ‚ÄùDone is better than perfect.‚Äù Repeat while burning your inner critic‚Äôs notebook.
Pro move: Share your half-baked idea with a friend. Their hype‚Äôll polish it for you.
Steal From Your Past Self
Old journals are gold mines. Cringe poetry from 2012? Plot twist: It‚Äôs a song lyric now.

Do this: Revisit abandoned projects. Time = fresh eyes.
Fun fact: The ‚ÄùOMG I wrote this?!‚Äù feeling is free dopamine.
Quit Trying to ‚ÄúFind‚Äù Inspiration‚ÄîCreate It
Passivity is the enemy. Inspiration isn‚Äôt found‚Äîit‚Äôs built.

Example: Challenge yourself to make something ugly on purpose. Ugly painting. Terrible poem. Takes the pressure off.
Try this: ‚ÄúReverse engineer‚Äù art you love. How‚Äôd they start? Copy their process, not their product.
Burnout is Inspiration‚Äôs Kryptonite
You can‚Äôt force creativity on 3 hours of sleep and 17 coffees.

Fix it: Schedule guilt-free lazy days. Binge anime. Nap. Let your brain reboot.
Truth bomb: Rest is productive.
Collaborate With Chaos
Team up with someone who does everything differently than you.

Case study: Musician + graphic designer = album art that slaps.
Low-key genius: Join a Discord group or local meetup. Random convos = unexpected sparks.
TL;DR
Inspiration isn‚Äôt about waiting‚Äîit‚Äôs about doing. Messily. Imperfectly. Consistently. Ditch the pressure to be original. Steal ideas. Embrace weird. And remember: Even Beyonc√© has off days.

Hey Atrioc fans,

You probably know the famous inside joke in the Atrioc community that Atrioc has ""glizzy hands"", supposedly stating that his fingers are made of hot dog wieners. This, of course, is the pinnacle of comedy, and will be the magnum opus of humanity throughout its entire history on this planet. However, I would like you all to consider a new joke to make about Atrioc. Perchance.

Here is my idea for a joke: Atrioc is a ""coffee cow"". The joke here is that it's saying that Atrioc really likes coffee, and in fact, is a ""cow"" for it. 

Now, I don't know Atrioc's actual opinions about coffee, but nevertheless, it could be funny to bring it up on stream. We can consider two outcomes of this joke:

1. Atrioc is not a fan of the ""coffee cow"" joke

If Atrioc does not like the joke, he will tell chat statements such as ""no chat I am not a coffee cow"" and ""what does that joke even mean?"". By telling his chat that he doesn't like the joke, the chat will not follow his directions and keep repeating the ""coffee cow"" joke to annoy him, generating more content.

2. Atrioc is a fan of the ""coffee cow"" joke

If Atrioc does like the joke, he will play into the bit, repeatedly calling himself the ""coffee cow"". Chat will also play into the bit, such as like they did with ""the smoothie king"".

I believe this joke has a lot of potential. Think of the things we could have by using this joke. We can have a ""CoffeeCow"" emote, leeches can use this joke in their videos, and Ludwig has a new thing to call Atrioc now! The #1 thing that we should do is repeat this joke nonstop for 1.5 years. I think doing that will be extremely beneficial to the Atrioc community. Perchance.

I hope you all consider this, and decide what's best for all of us.",3,1740962035.0,atrioc,1,1.0,False

1j2609a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delphitrial/comments/1j2609a/brief_notes_on_baldwins_2nd_dd_appearance_on_21725/,Brief Notes on Baldwin's 2nd DD Appearance on 2/17/25,"I once again took detailed notes, but the result was a very tedious read. Baldwin‚Äôs interview was little more than an incessant verbal flood. I was hoping he would hand off the case, but now I suspect that moment may never come so I'm posting the reader's digest version. This visit was notably shorter and more focused compared to his previous appearance, so I opted to provide a summary for the benefit anyone who may be interested. Bob Motta pontificated more in this episode and somehow made more outlandish statements than Baldwin.

**Baldwin Summary:**

Andrew Baldwin stated that Ricci Davis (RD), an inmate at New Castle Correctional Facility, requested his help in getting moved to a different pod due to safety concerns regarding KK. Baldwin used an IDOC contact to facilitate the transfer, after which RD ended up in segregation. RD told Baldwin he hoped for an investigation into KK and RL‚Äôs alleged involvement in the Delphi case, as he had spoken to both men about it. Baldwin ""uncovered"" RD‚Äôs 2017 conversation with RL in discovery, where RL allegedly confessed to him, but he never received the video recording of that interview despite RD insisting it existed. Baldwin reached out to the prosecution about it but never got a response.

During a February 2025 meeting, RD apologized to Baldwin for withholding information and revealed he had sent eight letters to prosecutor Nick McLeland starting in August 2024, detailing KK‚Äôs alleged confessions. Baldwin had never seen these letters and immediately requested them from McLeland, who vaguely responded that they had ""everything he provided."" Baldwin believes the letters should have been disclosed but acknowledges the possibility that RD could be lying. He filed a motion to preserve evidence to ensure any records of the letters are not lost. Baldwin admits the risk of making himself look foolish but insists it was necessary to file. He suggests a letter campaign to journalists to push for an investigation and remains frustrated by what he sees as a lack of transparency from the prosecution.

**Baldwin Is A Shit Judge of Character and Proud of It:**

Baldwin believes Ricci Davis is truthful because he has not requested any sentence reduction or personal benefit in exchange for his information, which is unusual for jailhouse informants. He also notes that RD placed himself at significant personal risk by speaking out, as he could face retaliation from other inmates, particularly KK. Baldwin found RD‚Äôs demeanor sincere and stated he showed no signs of deception, even becoming emotional when discussing his belief in RA‚Äôs innocence. Additionally, RD provided specific details about his interactions with KK and RL, and Baldwin, along with his team, spent time cross-referencing these claims with crime scene evidence, finding them ""very, very interesting."" While Baldwin acknowledges RD could be lying, he believes RD's willingness to subject himself to scrutiny and potential danger lends credibility to his statements.

**Crazy Things Baldwin Said:**

Baldwin made several outlandish or speculative statements throughout his discussion of Ricci Davis and the Delphi case. He suggested it was almost divine intervention that RD happened to be in pods with both RL in 2017 and KK in 2024, implying some larger cosmic connection to the case. Despite acknowledging that RD might be lying, Baldwin insisted that if he was, he must be a ""psychopath"" because Baldwin detected no deception‚Äîan assertion that seems overly confident given RD's criminal background. He also claimed that KK gave RD a ""blow-by-blow"" account of the Delphi murders that matched RL‚Äôs past statements but refused to disclose any specifics beyond calling them ""very, very interesting."" He also tells an anecdote about meeting some sketchy people in a shady motel about a tip that involved cannibalism.

Baldwin speculated that McLeland‚Äôs vague responses about RD‚Äôs letters were part of an effort to make him look foolish rather than just incompetence or bureaucratic inefficiency. He further asserted that if McLeland had overlooked the letters and later apologized, RA would forgive him because he‚Äôs ""such a good guy,"" an oddly subjective claim given RA‚Äôs conviction. In one of his most bizarre statements, Baldwin confidently stated that when RA is freed, they wouldn‚Äôt go for a celebratory beer but instead get coffee and Taco Bell. Throughout the interview, Baldwin repeatedly expressed frustration that he keeps getting ""sucked back in"" to the case despite wanting to move on, suggesting forces beyond his control keep dragging him into legal battles and media attention. He feels everyone's prayers for him. He also claimed that Davis used the word ""memorialized"" twice to refer to the prison keeping records/scans of outgoing mail - I am calling bullshit on that one. He mentions he has a buddy, Dave, who is completely in love with Ali because he also vapes.

**Crazy Things Bob Motta Said:**

Bob begins by calling RD‚Äôs 50-year sentence ""obscene,"" arguing that RD was treated unfairly when he turned himself in for a warrant without acknowledging the circumstances of the case. He acknowledges RD‚Äôs past as an addict but insists that this does not mean RD is inherently a liar, suggesting that addiction does not equate to dishonesty. Bob believes RD is credible because he did not seek a reduced sentence in exchange for information, noting that RD‚Äôs decision to come forward puts him at risk from both KK and other inmates. Bob also claims that McLeland either intentionally withheld RD‚Äôs letters, lost them during trial prep, or never received them, though he dismisses the latter as unlikely. He accuses McLeland of acting in a ""borderline unethical"" manner.

He mocks those who question the shifting suspects in the case and instead shifts focus to promoting Odinism as a valid angle. Bob emphasizes that whether intentional or not, a Brady violation still stands if the letters were lost or withheld. He also dismisses rumors that the defense team wanted a trial for media attention, insisting everyone's involvement is genuine. He suggests using Baldwin‚Äôs IDOC contact to help KA visit RA, as RD was able to get a transfer. He also proposes a letter-writing campaign to push journalists to investigate the missing letters, claiming that ""real investigative journalists"" on YouTube and social media, rather than mainstream outlets, will uncover the truth about RD‚Äôs claims.

**Reasonable Things Ali Motta Said:**

She is not signed up for another 4 hours with her husband and Baldwin.

Because the Odinist subculture in the area is locally well-known, it could be used as a red herring.

**Crazy Things Ali Motta Said:**

This is insane. This is completely insane. It‚Äôs like all of the avenues that they had right in front of them are all converging and they just ignored all of this and shoved in under the rug.

She‚Äôs baffled that Judge Gull is not suspicious of all of the bizarre coincidences in this case which seemed to be deliberate acts by the Prosecution to sabotage the Defense‚Äôs case.

**My Favorite Part:**

Bob reads a mean comment, laughs it off, and goes on a rant about how people have been leaving nasty comments for two years while he‚Äôs just trying to teach about due process, fair trials, and the constitution. He gets all fired up with anti-government rants, suggesting that anyone who disagrees with him thinks people should be locked up without trial. Meanwhile, Baldwin starts squinting like he's trying to read the fine print on a coupon. By the time Bob finishes, Baldwin's eyes are basically slits because even he wasn't full of shit enough to follow what Motta is saying. He looked like this: üòë

On the straightedge sub, any word mentioning caffeine gets auto-deleted, which seems a bit unfair but it‚Äôs their house. 

Straightedge is not a monolith. Especially when combined with veganism, we combine compassion for living things with clear-eyed world view. 

To this end, we can agree that coffee is an eddicrive drug, yes? Ok. 

While it has some benefit for the consumer, it often has a detrimental effect on the local producer. Child labor, modern-day slavery, corporate control and oppression are all rampant in the global south due to western, wealthy consumption. 

For the above reasons, coffee consumption is problematic for my vegan straightedge ethos. 

Here‚Äôs one of many many articles on the topic:

We‚Äôve been getting closer and closer‚Äîshe‚Äôs truly amazing and such a fun person. We speak in Italian, make fun of people in Italian, idk, we just have a great time when we hang out.

We usually hang out every weekend, go to bars, get some drinks, and dance. The first time we hung out, I asked her to grab a coffee, and she said yes. Then I asked if we could make it a date, and she told me she has a boyfriend who‚Äôs in Italy (they‚Äôre doing long distance). This was before we had ever met in person, so she had only seen pictures of me. Nothing happened at that coffee meetup.

But then we hung out the next weekend and went to a bar, where we got pretty drunk. I still knew what was going on, though. So we‚Äôre drinking, talking‚Äîit‚Äôs just me and her. Then, while we‚Äôre walking through the crowd, she reaches out for my hand to hold, which I didn‚Äôt think was weird, just normal. But then at the bar, we‚Äôre standing close, laughing, and she starts getting touchy‚Äîhugging me from behind, holding onto my arm, all that. And honestly, I liked it. I‚Äôve had a thing for her for a while, so it definitely made my night.

Now, I have no idea what‚Äôs going on with her and her boyfriend. She never talks about him, never mentions him, but she has a picture of them as her wallpaper. Anyway, after the bar, we hug, I go home, and a week goes by. During that week, she‚Äôs texting me every day‚Äîstuff like what are you doing‚Äîjust casual, but consistent.

The next weekend, we go out again. First, we grab a drink at a restaurant, just me and her, both sober. Even then, it‚Äôs flirty, we‚Äôre laughing, having fun. We start talking about relationships, and all she says is, I‚Äôve had one serious relationship. She doesn‚Äôt mention her boyfriend at all. She does talk about having other guy friends, though‚Äîlike, she mentioned two‚Äîwhich I don‚Äôt mind, but it made me wonder, does she act like this with all of them?

Then we head to the bar, and on the way there, she puts her arm around mine and rests her head on my shoulder. At that point, it was pretty obvious (at least to me) that we were flirting and being touchy. We get to the bar, and even while sober, she‚Äôs holding my hand, pulling me through the crowd, staying close.

But then I see her on her phone. I didn‚Äôt check it or anything, but I caught a glimpse, and it looked like an argument‚Äîjust a bunch of short messages being sent back and forth. I have no idea if it was with her boyfriend, but I saw a heart in the contact name, and I think I saw ‚Äúamore mio‚Äù (which means my love in English).

So now I‚Äôm stuck. I don‚Äôt know if she actually likes me, if she‚Äôs just like this with everyone, or what‚Äôs going on.

In short, instead of granting spells, the Kineticist's Gate Attenuator gives them a bonus impulse (Greater gives two, Major gives three). The Impulses they give are a set list, but if the Kineticist already has that impulse, the Attenuator gives any Impulse of that element. It must also be a level equal to or below the level the Kineticist gained the original impulse (If they gained Eternal Torch at Level 9, they gain any Fire Impulse which is Level 9 or lower). Impulses still scale with your level nonetheless.

Here's my initial list (Standard, Greater, Major):  
\- Air: Whisper on the Wind, Clear As Air, Body of Air  
\- Earth: Stepping Stones, Igneogenesis, Assume Earth's Mantle  
\- Fire: Eternal Torch, Thermal Nimbus, Furnace Form  
\- Metal: Flash Forge, Scrap Barricade, Alloy Flesh and Steel  
\- Water: Ocean's Balm, Return to the Sea, Sea Glass Guardians  
\- Wood: Fresh Produce, Wooden Palisade, Hedge Maze

After going through all the elements, this is what I came up with. Point was to pick the least combat options possible, focus on utility and for Major to grant a new form, but I wish there was more consistency among impulses.",1,1740961425.0,Pathfinder2e,0,1.0,False

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and postcards, and would like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to give that to someone else as well.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into the other or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time.

My ideal communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US. I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal - cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences, so I'm more open to people from parts of the world more distinct from my own. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

* I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else. Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life. I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction. Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.
* I'm INTJ and am Type 5. I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

I feel like I'm chasing an imagination of a person that can hardly be reached by an actual person out there, because, well, it is an imagination.

And the weird thing is, I'm kinda fine with it. There are indeed moments of solitude and melancholy where I wish for that perfect person to share the peaceful sunset on a mountain top with me. But often enough I've realized the people I go on dates with don't meet my ""standards"".

I'm in love with a specific person who is, however, a friend. We're too far apart from each other though, also on an emotional level. Just the idea of us being together in some parallel universe gives me peace.

Maybe my standards aren't that high. But maybe that type of person wouldn't roam dating platforms and go out on boring coffee dates.
I have so much to share. Some of the most secret and beautiful spots all around Europe. To watch the sunset, the stars, wild animals or the polar lights. But they're like a treasure to me. I don't want to share them unless it's the right person to be let in into my secret little world.
It's because the appreciation for those places matters so much to me. I want to cover her eyes and then uncover them when the perfect light hits the mountain cliffs during sunset. Look over a sea of fog and not say a word, just listen to the sound of the wind echoing through the gorges and feeling that connection of our minds and hearts without talking.

I want the exact level of excitement I have about my favorite shows, music and books. I want to dive into a Stranger Things marathon or listen to M83 and talk about each different album, quote some books during the right moments or light up the fire place at home and just sit there and enjoy the coziness on a winter evening.

Yeah I guess that's pretty much it.
I prefer those vivid imaginary scenarios that I sometimes relive in my dreams over another boring date in a bar or caf√©.

Am I extra weird or is this indeed an INTP thing?

But first, some disclaimers. The majority of students and faculty at BYU were kind, honest, hard working, and deeply dedicated to their faith. They were outstanding people and remain a bright light in memories that are mostly dark. I wish that I could have been truly honest with them.

Also, I acknowledge that I wasnt ""forced"" to attend BYU. For a long time I carried guilt and shame for choosing to stay in a place where I clearly didn't belong. But I'm also old enough now to appreciate the pressures that led me to stay, and I've finally learned to give my younger self some grace. 

For as long as I can remember, I planned to go to BYU. My parents met there and most of my siblings graduated from there. With it's affordability, proximity to extended family, and competitive music program, it seemed like the obvious choice. So when I drove out with my then boyfriend (now husband), I felt excited for a new start.

I was, I'll admit, less excited for BYU's religiosity. The Californian public schools I grew up in normalized openly diverse beliefs in education. School-wide religious endorsement was considered an infringement on the rights of the non-religious, and to me that seemed fair. After all, as a ""weird Mormon girl"" I benefitted from the imposed respect of different beliefs just like anyone else.

So imagine my unease when nearly every class at BYU opened with a prayer, or included institutionally sanctioned (required even!) discussions about the eternal truthfulness of the LDS church. It felt gross somehow, like we were violating the principles of education and open thought. But initially I just sighed and reminded myself that religious indoctrination was the privilege of a private university. 

Still, things at BYU immediately felt ""off."" The student body appeared creepily homogeneous, and not just because it was mostly white.  Men had to have clean shaven faces and short hair, and women could not wear anything remotely ""revealing"" like skirts above the knees, midriff-showing crop tops, or (gasp!) sleeveless shirts. ""Extreme"" self expressions such as tattoos, multiple piercings, or weird hair colours were reportable offences. 

Reportable to who? Either the student's bishop or the Honor Code Office, a Big Brother-esque entity that ""encouraged"" students and staff to comply with all Honor Code rules. Their methods of encouragement usually involved threats of probation, suspension, or expulsion from BYU. Insidiously, students were encouraged and expected to snitch on their peers. The thought of being summoned to the Honor Code Office filled every student with dread.

Beyond dress and grooming standards, the Honor Code imposed strict rules of conduct both on and off campus. No drugs, alcohol, coffee, tea, swearing, unmarried sex, or any form of ""same-sex romantic behavior."" Students were even forbidden from entering the bedrooms of the opposite sex.

In recent years when retelling this story, this is the point when my nonmember friends would be visibly aghast at the level of control imposed on adults. They'd ask, ""How was this legal?!"" And I'd shrug. It's a private university. Their rules, their way. Meanwhile, my faithful friends would defensively berate me, saying that I agreed to this! And they'd be right. Before entering BYU, all students were required to sign the Honor Code.

But try to imagine the head space of a faithful 18 year old girl. I lived all my life following the rules outlined in the Honor Code, so continuing these rules seemed natural. Sure, the housing regulations were infantalizing, but I thought I could live with the Honor Code in exchange for a good education.

I was wrong. I underestimated the sense of freedom and curiosity that came with leaving home. I chafed at the stupid rules and the stifling religious monoculture, and I was disturbed by the institutionalized peer surveillance.

And even worse, my faith was cracking. LDS church history wasn't sitting right with me. Church leadership appeared increasingly inept as God's chosen emissaries. And as an young female adult, I found the church's unapologetic patriarchy and sexism suffocating. I started seeing hypocrisy and injustice everywhere, and within one semester even my faith in god was shattered.

Now at this part, I really wish I then showed some self respect, or just even basic self preservation, and transferred the hell outta there. But I didn't. I worked so hard to get into BYU and I truly thought I had no better options. I decided to grit my teeth, ""put my shoulder to the wheel,"" and finish it out.

At first I was honest to my bishops about my faith issues, naively believing they'd appreciate my integrity. But I quickly realized that some old white men were more understanding than others, and after a few close calls I learned to just keep my head low and play sweet. I buried myself in my studies and had zero social life in fear of exposing my apostasy. 

One could only live in this state of self-imposed oppression for so long before something had to give. Masking my true beliefs 24/7 was slowly killing me, and I found my only outlet on the weekends, when I would ""stay at Grandma's"" in a nearby city and spend the night with my boyfriend. There we engaged in all sorts of Honor Code violations and debauchery, like drinking coffee and playing video games his bedroom. 

Rebelling felt good, but it also felt infuriatingly dangerous. To quote an apostle, when leaders spoke the thinking was done, and spiritual dissidence was viewed with suspicion. Life on campus seemed like that dystopian world in A Wrinkle in Time, where all the children bounced their balls in sync with the heartbeat of IT. When I said something off-script, heads turned and the room fell silent. One pro-LGBT comment, one criticism of male leadership, one glimpse of me publicly wearing a tank top, and I risked getting reported and called in.

My annoyance at the institution morphed into anxiety and eventually full blown paranoia. As I progressed through my degree, I folded into myself and tried to be small and unnoticeable. This strategy helped me slip through the cracks, but it took an immense emotional toll. This culminated in a complete nervous breakdown when I unexpectedly failed my senior recital hearing. My music teacher clearly thought I was overreacting. He didn't understand my desperation; he couldn't know why staying for one more semester would kill me. 

I did, somehow, make it through my recital, although it still remains the most stressful day of my life. When graduation came, I didn't walk. And when my diploma showed up in the mail, I finally felt free and left the LDS church.

Now when I look back at that time, I'm filled with so much regret. Not because I broke the rules but because I chose to stay in a place that was openly hostile towards people like me. I chose silence and fear over authenticity, passivity over open defiance. I wish I could hug that young woman and tell her it's ok, that she did the best she could with the knowledge and circumstances she had. That she did enough by rejecting a belief system that told her she was nothing without it and ultimately nothing within it. I'd tell her she didn't deserve to suffer, but she will learn from it.

And this is what I learned:
1. Most people are inherently good regardless of the belief system they're in.
2. Society really does benefit from diversity in thought and culture. 
3. More of America is primed for authoritarianism than you know. The majority of BYU students reportedly have a great time there, which makes sense since we all enjoy interacting with like-minded people. But I also think people who fit within a system are less likely to notice or be bothered by the system's absurdities. I can't tell you how many times someone vehemently defended the most infantalizing rules and surveillance culture because they kept us pure and worthy of BYU. That if we're truly valiant, the rules shouldn't bother us. 
4. I will never again subject myself to living in the shadows and in fear. Things are crazy right now and I'm already hearing of people self-censoring at work and online. Last time I found myself in an oppressive system, I got in, got out, and quietly drove off into the sunset. This time around, I have my kid's futures to think of and far fewer f*cks to give. This time, I will not be silent.

The wand died probably 2 years in but I got a separate steamer so who cares. The pressure gauge died last year, but had just been eyeballing it since then and then the pressure of the system died and every shot came out the same water non-pressurized no matter the grind size.

I'm debating between ordering the same thing for $550, or going with a Bambino and a quality grinder for about the same or slightly less.

My only concern about the Bambino is that while I've been eyeballing without a pressure gauge for a year and my shots were coming out fine after some testing, it had helped that initially I had 7 years of using the pressure gauge to get a feel for each brand of coffee bean I used where the right grind size should be. Concerned I'll have trouble getting good shots out of the Bambino for a while.

Really wish there was a quality compact espresso machine like the Bambino but with a pressure gauge that's not crazy expensive.

Why I wouldn't just get another Barista Express? Well I have a bad back and it's heavy so not looking forward to getting it out of the box and up on the counter. Also I'd like to upgrade my grinder game after eight years and not just use the built in grinder and I already have a separate milk steamer I like so I don't need that aspect. I never need to make multiple shots like I'm throwing a party, so a smaller size and smaller size tank would be good.

But in the end I'll probably just get another Barista Express. But wondering if there's a more compact alternative?",1,1740960421.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

I'm trying not to shake as I'm pretty unsettled so I'll be as coherent as I can. about 2 hours ago, some number called. it was pretty weird, as it was already kinda late but I answered (I do expect a few calls these days, I don't usually answer to numbers I don't know). 

there was a guy on the other line, immediately calling me by name. asked if he got the number right, and he literally started to describe my physique. I was weirded out, and I automatically thought it's someone from uni who's trying to prank me. especially since a few days ago I had an argument with an acquaintance. I started questioning him, and he kept... telling me about myself. the college I go to, the group, my old address, hell, he even knew what kind of books I like. he kept telling me he liked me, he's from my uni group although he's not coming too often to lectures. at this point I'm creeped out - yet I'm trying to push him to tell me who he is, as apparently, I already know him from uni. he refused to give me his name, yet he invited me out for coffee. like what the hell?? he even offered to drive me to uni tomorrow, like, how big of an idiot do you think I am? 

he did tell me that it was that *acquaintance* (I'll call her x) of mine who gave him my number cause oh he has such a huge crush on me. I dm-ed x and she denied. well, now, I don't fully believe her. she is in fact the type of person who would do this. now I don't even know what to do...? I'm not even trying to think that it was her who gave my number, I'm pretty shaken. he clearly stalked me, he knows way too much. like... there were a few details not even x knew, and I know I may sound detached writing this, but I'm freaking out internally. I'm too freaked out to go to uni tomorrow, I even turned off my location just in case. 

and I don't know what to do. I woke up my mom when I called her, and she told me ""oh it's classic college boy behavior"" - like, Jesus Christ it's not??? a stranger literally called and started to describe me in very specific detail under the pretense he likes me - dude did some really deep digging. I'm pretty sure no normal college boy does that. 

there's a morning train, I'm thinking of going home cause I'm really unsettled to stay alone in this apartment, fully aware that he is able to find my new address (I just moved out, he still had my old one). I'm a bit afraid my parents would think I'm exaggerating. also, is the police able to find people based on phone number? I still have an officer's number due to an old incident (nothing bad just a mild theft), I was thinking of dm-ing him tomorrow, although I'm not sure if I'll been taken seriously. like, they ignore much bigger problems. 

sorry if I sounded weird in any way. I'm freaking sleep deprived and anxious right now. has anyone gone through anything similar? I've never been stalked on this level before, I'm not sure how to react or what to do next.

This time around, we checked out a few things we missed last time. We visited the Hill and were surprised by how Italian it was, very reminiscint of Chinatown and how Asian it was. Got a good coffee and some pastries at Cafe Dolce - very friendly staff! Charlie's gittos was not out favorite. The Alfredo was very bland but two thumbs up for fior Borghese dish - we think we would have liked some things like calamari, toasted rav, and the lobster bisque but already had ate so much that day!

Got some butter cake at Louie's Ouey Goeey butter cakes - Im sure I misspelled! St Louis is home of the butter cake and shout out to the friendly service!

The Ritz Carlton in Clayton exceeded our expectations. With a TV in the mirror, a balcony overlooking the Clayton Business district, a popping lobby bar, cigar lounge and sushi bar, we were impressed! I had a short cigar while my girl enjoyed one of the best espresso martinis of her life in the cigar lounge. Very professional and abundantly welcoming staff at Ritz St Louis and exceeded our experience at Ritz Chicago. 

Delmar loop had some cool shops and restaurants! Vibrant artwork was also cool. We ate at salt and smoke and shared a 3 meat platter, but sadly didn't get any pics. Great value and taste overall. 

Finished trip with just over an hour at city museum. As adults this was still so fun! I have never been and my girl not since a kid. We explored and spelunking in the cave system was a highlight. Pinball arcade in city museum left more to be desired, with several machines not working. We polished things off with a trip to protzels for sandwiches! Must be patient getting food here at lunch time - just over 20 mins for the line and checkout but worth it. Cool chips and Fitz root beer selection. We tried to visit Fitz restaurant but it was busy and never got around to it, so a couple bottles at protzels was a perfect alternative. 

Traffic was a bit heavier than last visit, but we didn't even know marti gras was happening until our Uber said something! We would like to come back to visit for that next year. The art museum was super busy in Tower Grove this morning and maybe because of marti gras. We just skipped it and opted for city museum instead.

I found out because his mistress reached out to me on social media and told me everything! She knew about me the whole time, I had no clue about her. I never thought my husband would even be capable of doing this to me. Anyway, I put him out and told him I was divorcing him. I ended up losing a very close family member about 2 weeks after I put him out. In a vulnerable state, I allowed him to come back home and try reconciliation. I was extremely depressed and spiraling. Reconciliation seemed to be going well. He was home a lot more. We were going on a lot of dates, and things seemed to be going well. Fast forward to the beginning of February, the same damn mistress reached out to me and told me they actually never stopped messing around! He would go over to her house and screw her, then come home to me as if nothing happened! I was crushed! This second discovery seemed to hurt worse than the first time. He literally was cheating on me while I was grieving and struggling mentally. I told him to leave and that I was done for good. I told him I was filing for divorce. Now, this is where I want to know if IATAH. Last week, while I was sleeping, my husband came in, took my phone, and went through it. I had no idea. He saw me messaging with an old male coworker of mine who was recently divorced. I was asking him for advice and basically venting. We met up for coffee twice. No romantic feelings are involved at all. Now my husband is saying that I betrayed him, and he can't believe I would do that and is now refusing to speak to me at all. He says that I cheated on him. We have been married 11 years, and I have NEVER cheated on him! I can't stand cheaters. He has told his mother that I cheated on him, and now she's harassing me. So please give me your honest opinion, AITAH?

Update: I noticed a few comments suggesting that I change the locks. I didn't know if I could or not. Am I allowed to change the locks even though we are still legally married and the house is shared property? Most of his belongings are gone, but he still gets mail here, and we share 2 sons together.

In hindsight maybe it's a good thing, because I've had to do a lot of my own research. Unfortunately, I'm still not really sure what I'm dealing with. 

It‚Äôs been quite a wild few days, ending with me sitting here in a Waffle House, scared out of my fucking wits. I'm confident that I'm safe here, though, so let's go back a bit.

While I was waiting around for answers here and for Diego to come home, I decided to poke around this ‚Äúfascination-endss‚Äù blog. I was hoping for some possible evidence leading to it being poached by a random who was just heartlessly fucking with me. Luka had used this blog quite regularly, and yet no matter how much I refreshed, everything had been wiped. The theme was the same, his icon was still that same Pierrot clown from some obscure Eastern European film, and the blog title and bio were the same as the day he'd set it up. But the posts were all gone prior to me interacting with‚Ä¶whoever was messaging me.

But after? One post. One post remained. Nothing that really stood out, it was a reblogged picture of some aesthetic-y cemetery. It looked like half a dozen other ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù pictures on the site, so in ordinary circumstances, it would not have meant much. But my circumstances were anything but ordinary, and I found myself dissecting each aspect of the post since I was done humoring whoever messaging me. 

A cemetery. Gravestones, specifically. Luka was dead, so the symbolism felt rather on the nose. The blog that posted was nonalimmen, and after some Googling, I found that nona meant ‚Äúninth‚Äù. It was originally posted April 9th, 2020. That date didn't really mean anything to me, but Luka supposedly reblogged it May 19th, 2020. When he was alive, Luka was very interested in numerology. I know fuckall about it, so if anyone can tell me if there's something here, please share. The only conclusion I came to was the number nine popped up a few times, but what's nine mean? Or am I missing something. The link is [here](https://fascination-endss.tumblr.com/?source=share), by the way. The blog is still up, though I‚Äôve tried to report the account multiple times now. 

As soon as Uncle Diego came home, I showed him the Tumblr messages from ‚ÄúLuka‚Äù on my phone. It didn‚Äôt take him long to read through them and completely dismiss my growing unease. 

‚ÄúIt's just someone being a dick on the internet.‚Äù

I figured he was going to say as much, but it was still frustrating. ‚ÄúBut how would they know I was back in town? And when I came back? That's clearly someone who knows me.‚Äù 

Diego couldn't really argue with that point. He was quiet for a minute before handing me back his phone. ‚ÄúI just don't know why you'd automatically assumed it was Luka. You know he's gone. You've got to move on.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho else could it be?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't know, you have anyone that hates you? What about Rosette's ex, didn't he hate your guts in school?‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúThis isn't some high school bully, Mike wouldn't stoop that fucking low, would he?‚Äù

Diego shrugged. ‚ÄúWell I don't fucking know then. Say it is Luka. Why is a ghost messaging you on Tumblr? Why is his ghost haunting you of all people? He died on his sister's property, why wouldn't he haunt her?‚Äù

I was speechless for a moment. ‚ÄúI was his best friend,‚Äù I whispered, a little hurt. ‚ÄúMaybe he's still mad at me for leaving.‚Äù

Diego sighed and shook his head. ‚ÄúBlock that person,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey've got you all messed up. You've gotta get over this stuff.‚Äù 

He was probably right, but that wasn't what I wanted to hear. But it was easier to leave it at that than fight it. 

I debated whether or not I should reply to the message before finally deciding it was in my best interest to block the account. And yet, when I got out of the shower, I had a new notification on my phone:


fascination-endss: ghost?

‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶‚Äù I knew I blocked the account. I was sure of it. And yet he was no longer on my blocklist. Still, I knew Tumblr wasn't a well oiled machine, so maybe it was a glitch? Against better judgement, I responded. 

Me: ghost? What, like you?

fascination-endss: you're ghosting me again 

Me: please leave me alone, whoever you are

fascination-endss: why? Now we can't be friends?

Me: you're not my friend

fascination-endss: Im not?

Me: You're not Luka. He's dead.

fascination-endss: im dead?

Me: stop fucking with me

fascination-endss: I know I'm dead but I'm here :)

Me: who's here?

fascination-endss: Luka

Me: OK troll, if you're Luka, what was he like? 

fascination-endss: Mute. Didnt have many friends. And then I died

At this point it was late, I was in bed on my phone, absolutely losing it. I should have just gone to bed, but I kept it going. 

Me: Ok smart guy, how did you die?

I figured maybe, in the rational part of my brain I was trying to listen to, before deleting them all, this person just saw Luka's posts and gathered that much about him. He did often use this blog as a diary, after all. But all that thought went out the window once they, he, replied.

fascination-endss: you were there, you should know. I fell down the gully. My neck snapped on the way down. My ribs tore into my lungs. By the time you made it down I was already suffocating on my own blood. And then I died :)

I threw my phone away from me, scared it was haunted or something. It smacked the wall and landed with an unceremonious thud on the floor, and I didn't hear another notification. Fine by me. 

I was in a cold sweat, and suddenly felt like I was being watched. But the idea of leaving the bed felt weirdly terrifying, and like a child, I hid under the covers with my inhaler and my thoughts. My entire being trembled with fear, making sleep impossible. 

After hours of silence, I slowly pulled the sheet away and sat up. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I could see the room was empty. The few things I had unpacked were untouched, and the curtain on the window danced delicately in the breeze. I figured I should probably grab my phone off the floor. 

Slowly, I placed a foot on the cold hardwood and immediately regretted it. The feeling I felt around my ankle can only be described as a cold hand, gripping and pulling. I yanked back in fear, letting out a yelp as I did so, but I got tangled in my sheet and ended up falling on the floor instead. 

‚ÄúFuck fuck fuck fuck--‚Äù I was now terrified that whatever the fuck grabbed my ankle was now able to get the rest of me. I grabbed my phone and scrambled out of the room like a bat out of hell, too scared to peek under the bed in fear that something would peek back. I finished the night on the couch, relieved that at least there were no new messages awaiting me. When I told Diego about it in the morning, he chastised me for cracking my phone screen (I threw it pretty hard) and said it was probably just a night terror.

Just a night terror. I guess you can call it that.

Diego was sure that I just needed to get out of the house. He lent me his truck and told me to go link up with old friends, as I had to get out of my head. Will had left town to live with an girl he met in Pennsylvania, but Rosette was still around, still working at the same diner she was when I first left the state. 

‚ÄúWell shit on my ass, is that Benny Gomez!?‚Äù Clearly, she was happy to see me, and she practically leapt over the counter to hug me. 

‚ÄúIn the flesh,‚Äù I replied. She may have been my ex from high school, but we had remained close friends despite it all and I was grateful for her. Her excitement to see me lifted my spirits. 

‚ÄúI heard you'd be coming back but you never told us when, how ya been Benny-boy?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI've been better.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's code for you're not doin‚Äô well. I heard about your Mama, I'm really sorry. But it's good to see ya, really. We're all gonna help ya get through this.‚Äù

She had me a little misty eyed at the mention of mom, and it wasn't long before she and I were sharing a booth and I was crying my eyes out, telling her my woes.

‚ÄúYanno your uncle don't live that far from me. Come over any time.‚Äù

I nodded, trying to compose myself. I'd already gone through at least thirty napkins. ‚ÄúIt's just, Luka and Mom back to back, I think it's got me going a little crazy.‚Äù I let out a nervous laughter. ‚ÄúH-hey, uh, by the way, do you know what Mike's doing these days?‚Äù

The mention of her ex had her visibly confused. ‚ÄúMike? Why?‚Äù

I hesitated for a moment, but ultimately decided to show her the Tumblr messages I'd gotten. ‚ÄúI can't think of anyone who hates me so much they'd fuck with me like this. And it has to be someone who knows me.‚Äù

Her face was pale as she read through each message, and her hand was shaky when she slid my phone back. ‚ÄúI, I don't think Mike would stoop that low. He beat you up in school but I don't think he's a psychopath, yanno?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen who is it?‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúI don't know, Benny. That's really weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's not all.‚Äù I told her about the other strange happenings. The clown on the side of the road. The scratching under the bed. The thing grabbing my ankle. 

Unlike Diego, she didn't immediately just dismiss my experiences. But she was obviously confused. ‚ÄúThat's weird. That's really weird. But I mean, why, if this is what you're implyin‚Äô and it's Luka's ghost, why's he bein‚Äô so mean to you? You were his best friend, Benny.‚Äù

I felt my old guilt bubble up within me. ‚ÄúWhat if he's angry? I was his best friend and I left to go live my life while he was stuck here. And I drifted away. And then I show back up, and I was right there-- and I didn't catch him. It's like symbolic, you know? Failing to be there for him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou gotta let that go, that don't even make sense. He was so happy for you, we all were. You were trying to follow your dreams, we all supported and understood that. He wouldn't be resentful.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why's he doing this?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you so sure it's him? They say demons like to feed off of bad energy, and you're carrying a lot of bad energy my friend.‚Äù

For some reason, I was skeptical of her theory, mostly because I wasn't religious. But she was Catholic, so of course her mind went there. Out of respect, I didn't argue. 

‚ÄúYou need a priest,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúOr some sage or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'll think about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThink about it? You should just do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno,‚Äù I sighed. There was an odd part of me that didn't want to exorcise what this was, because if it was Luka, for as cruel as he was being, I found some strange comfort in the fact he was still around. 

I came home to an box of things in my room. ‚ÄúDiego, what's this?,‚Äù I called, hoping it was something he knew about and not more of Luka's tricks. 

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù Diego wandered in half dressed and reeking of cologne. ‚ÄúOh yeah, Gia dropped that off for you. Only open it if you're ready though-- she said it's some of Luka's old stuff. She's trying to get rid of a lot but she figured he'd want you to have some of those things.‚Äù

‚ÄúI missed Gia? Damn‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShe ain't too far,‚Äù he assured. ‚ÄúYou gonna be alright with this tonight? I kinda got a date tonight, I didn't expect Gia to drop by. I can cancel if you need me to.‚Äù

I shook my head. I had to face this. ‚ÄúNah, have fun,‚Äù I said, waving him off. 

Gia was Luka's sister. On top of the box was a note from her: ‚ÄúBenny: Heard you were back in town. I hope you're doing ok. I'm sorry about your mother, especially so soon after Luka. He'd want you to have this stuff, they meant a lot to him. Try to visit soon, I would like to see you before I move. -Gia‚Äù

She also left me her current phone number and email. Setting the note aside, I opened the box up. Memories of Luka flooded in. She left me his prized comics, his CDs and his old sketchbook. There were also a few of his weird little porcelain Pierrot clowns.

‚ÄúYou really were into these guys, huh?,‚Äù I laughed to myself. They creeped me out, but I displayed them anyways out of respect. 

The two biggest, and probably most impactful, items in the box were Luka's old radio and his omnichord. Luka was very into music, not just listening to it but listening to it. I figured it was his way of having a voice since he was mute. 

To my dismay, I couldn't get the radio to work. A shame since I rather liked some of these CDs. I hoped to have some luck with the omnichord-- and I did. 

Hearing some of Luka's old saved music instantly got tears flowing. It was as nostalgic as it was melancholy. I set it aside and let it play through before continuing to sort through what was left to me.

It suddenly crackled a bit before shitting out. ‚ÄúAh, no‚Ä¶‚Äù I wondered if the batteries died. As I flipped it over to see what size I needed, however, the speaker played sound once more. 

But it wasn't Luka's music. It was a voice. It caught me off guard, and I told myself it was just something he'd sampled. 

There was no way he could have sampled this, though. This wasn't the voice of an actor or a song. That was MY voice. It was shaky and out of breath.

‚ÄúYou're gonna be ok. It's gonna be ok. Just hang on.‚Äù It crackled, and then repeated. ‚ÄúYou're gonna be ok. It's gonna be ok. Just hang on.‚Äù

I dropped the instrument on my bed and stared on in utter horror. Not only was that my voice, it was my voice from that night. My words of assurance that night. The last words I said to Luka. I ripped the batteries out and it stopped. 

‚ÄúThere's no shot,‚Äù I breathed. ‚ÄúNo fucking shot.‚Äù Had I said those same things some other time we'd hung out? And he recorded me without knowing? But what would have been the context? My thoughts raced like mad, but I couldn't come up with a memory to explain what I'd heard.

The fear had me nearly hyperventilating, and I reached for my inhaler. Strange, I thought I'd left it on the nightstand. I lifted the bed skirt to see if it'd fallen, but no luck. I ripped the covers off and shook them out, at this point getting a little worried now. ‚ÄúDiego!,‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúDiego!‚Äù

Oh right, he wasn't home. I searched the house, the truck, and still, no inhaler. My chest felt tight now. I returned to my room, continuing to tear it apart in search. I checked under the bed one more time-- there it was. How had I missed that? 

It was all the way under though, and I was straining to reach it. My panic grew as I squeezed myself in the tight space, especially since it was under this bed that weird shit was happening. 

‚ÄúGotcha--‚Äù Sweet relief flooded in as I was able to secure it, and I sat on the bedroom floor as I took a few puffs, breathing deep despite how shaken up I was. 

Once I was sure I wasn't going to have a real attack, I started to calm down. But as my heart pounding stopped flooding my ears, another sound became clear. That radio was finally working. 

And it was playing a song called ‚ÄúSuffocation‚Äù. 

‚ÄúNo way‚Ä¶‚Äù Of all the songs to crackle out of that old speaker, it was called ‚ÄúSuffocation‚Äù, and I couldn't breathe. I shuddered, afraid to approach the radio.

Out of nowhere, it stopped.

‚ÄúLuka?,‚Äù I asked aloud. No response. ‚ÄúLuka, was that you?‚Äù

Silence. 

‚ÄúStrange,‚Äù I muttered to myself. It wasn't strange though. It was horrifying. 

The rest of the night was quiet, which almost scared me more. It was the anticipation. I was waiting for Luka to do something again, whether through the radio or under the bed or something. I half expected those Pierrot dolls to get up and dance. But it was a quiet night, as was the following. 

Diego was confused by the omnichord, but he tried to assure me that I was misremembering, no matter how creepy it was. However, he struggled to convince himself, as I detected a lot of doubt in his voice. Same when he tried to blame the radio on faulty wiring. I didn't press him, as the doubt told me he was starting to believe me regardless. Maybe he was just trying to make me feel better. 

The following night was full of scratching under the floorboards. It was incessant and went on all. Night. Long. I couldn't sleep at all. 

In the morning, I saw I had a cheeky little message from Tumblr. Despite blocking the account, again. 


fascination-endss: Bennyyyy


This was the first time he used my name. 

fascination-endss: Benny you're not replying to me anymore. Tired?

Tired? Of course I was tired. I had been kept up the whole damn night. Still, I didn't reply. 


fascination-endss: come on Sleepyhead :(


Sleepyhead was always his nickname for me, and for some reason, it got me a little soft. What if Luka was just trying to make himself known, but just didn't know how? I mean, how does one haunt someone without being so‚Ä¶terrifying?


Me: Im very tired yes


fascination-endss: not sleeping well?


Me: you would know, wouldn't you?


fascination-endss: how would I know silly? Take good care of my stuff :) Those comics are a good read


Me: the trick with the radio wasn't funny


fascination-endss: What trick?


Me: you know


fascination-endss: I might :)


Me: why are you being so mean?


I didn't get a response. Of course I didn't. 

The following day, I decided to visit Gia. I wanted to thank her in person, but also, share all the insanity I'd witnessed.

Like Luka, Gia was a little eccentric. He made art with his music, she painted. She also like clowns, though not the black and white Pierrots like he did. She liked those creepy, rainbow circus clowns. Even though most of her stuff was packed up, there were still a few clowns out here and there. They gave me the creeps. 

‚ÄúI'm so sorry about your mother.‚Äù Gia had waited to have a real conversation with me until we were sat with coffee, as she'd wanted the ‚Äúvibes‚Äù to be right. Sitting on the patio with a Mason jar of iced coffee definitely brought back memories. 

I had grown a little tired of hearing it, but I knew she meant well. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said, not sure if that was the right response. ‚ÄúSame to you about Luka.‚Äù Though I'm sure she was tired of hearing that. 

‚ÄúI still can't believe he's really gone. It's so quiet here now without his little bloopy noises.‚Äù

‚ÄúI bet. Do you ever‚Ä¶‚Äù I hesitated a moment. 

Gia was always pretty open to most things. She was one of those free spirits, and it was her who told me stories about how supposedly haunted this property was. So I figured it would be safe to ask.

‚ÄúDo you ever think maybe he's like, still around? Like, you know, like spiritually or something?‚Äù

The question clearly caught her off guard, as she about choked on her coffee. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù I told her just about everything. 

When I finished, she was quiet a moment. ‚ÄúI do think he's around sometimes.‚Äù Her face looked disturbed. ‚ÄúBut nothing so frightening. Sometimes, the windchimes will sound like his music, or the things I thought I'd lost will pop back up. But nothing ever bad. Luka was always such a sweet, timid soul. Why would you think he'd do those things?‚Äù

I feared I had offended her. ‚ÄúI mean, maybe he's just mad at me?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe'd never be that mad.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut maybe that's how it like, manifests? As a spirit.‚Äù

She pursed her lips in thought, looking a little upset. ‚ÄúI still don't think he'd do such a thing, but I'm not denying what you're experiencing so don't think that, please. I just, I couldn't see Luka being so upset with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I just really hurt him.‚Äù

Gia stood, looking out across her property. A long, sad sigh left her. ‚ÄúI don't know. I don't know what to tell you, but I think I don't want to talk about it anymore. I mean, I kind of wish I could have such experiences to, you know, know he was listening or something. But, I'm trying to sell this place so I can move on. I think you need to find a way to do the same. Call me if you need anything, ok?‚Äù She turned to me. ‚ÄúI think you should go now.‚Äù

That could have gone better. But it could have gone worse, I told myself. I could only imagine how unsettling this was for Gia. Maybe I shouldn't have told her as much as I had. I probably did nothing but stir up old trauma.

That brings us to last night, the most active night thus far. You might be wondering why the fuck I'd still choose to sleep in this room after everything that's happened so far. Up until this point, thought, while scared, I haven't felt I was in any real danger. The closest I got to that was my ankle being grabbed, but given that nothing happened after, even as I was there on the floor, I figured he was just still trying to scare me. But last night, I felt real danger for the first time. 

After a shower, I decided to get back on my laptop to do some paranormal research. Did I have a ghost on my hands? A poltergeist? I needed answers and solutions, and at this point, I still had yet to get a response on my last post. My phone buzzed.

Another Tumblr message. I opened it up on my laptop. 

fascination-endss: up late?


Me: it's only nine.


fascination-endss: you'll be up late 


Me: for the last time really, who is this???? 


fascination-endss: it's Luka! Promise :)


Me: Luka's gone


fascination-endss: then who's messaging you?


Me: that's what I'm trying to figure out


fascination-endss: so you don't believe me? :(


Me: why should I?


fascination-endss: why not?


Me: because he's dead 


fascination-endss: and who's fault is that? 


I felt sick to my stomach, not wanting to respond. My hands hovered over the keyboard when I felt the absolutely unmistakable feeling of hot breath on my neck. Chills gripped me as I whipped my head around, expecting to see a face or something.

Nothing behind me. 

‚ÄúOf course not‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered to myself, shudderkng before turning back to my laptop. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶no no no no!‚Äù Every message was gone. Every last one. Any proof I had that this was still happening was gone. 


fascination-endss: They'll never believe it! :D


Then, in front of my eyes, that message disappeared as well, before the whole laptop shut off. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck,‚Äù I whispered, trembling as I set the laptop on the nightstand. Maybe the evidence would still be on my phone?

No dice.

I sat quiet in the dark, wondering what to do now. It was early, but I figured all I could do was sleep on it. As soon as I laid down, it started.

Scratch scratch scratch. 

It was louder and more violent than it had ever been, and even though I knew I shouldn't, I mustered up the courage to lean over the bed and look. A shaky hand lifted the bed skirt, and eyes met my own. 

A scream couldn't escape my mouth before before cold, stiff hands were over it, hands full of malice. Even in the dark there was no mistaking the face that stared back at me. Blood, twigs, white and black makeup. He twitched, causing me to close my eyes and flinch, and soon as I opened them again, he was gone. The hands were as well, but at this point I was so scared I couldn't even scream.

Too scared to leave the bed in fear he'd grab me, I backed myself into the corner, the sheets over my head like I was a scared child. That was certainly how I felt, helpless and small. The scratching started once more, but this time, it didn't sound like it was under the floorboards. It sounded close, like it was on the wall, the same wall I was now pressed to.

A hand started tugging on the sheet, but I refused to let go. I couldn't face him, not again. I didn't want to see him like that ever again. He pulled harder, and I started to plead with him.

‚ÄúIf this is Luka, stop! Why are you being so mean to me? Please!,‚Äù I wailed. ‚ÄúI'm sorry, ok? I'm so sorry, please!‚Äù 

The scratching just grew louder and more violent, the sheet was pulled so hard that I was now exposed. I saw nothing in the shadows, but felt something. Something cold and suffocating. That unmistakable sensation of hot breath came once more, this time against my cheek. My teeth chattered as I squeezed my eyes shut, continuing to whisper apologies. I felt something warm and wet slide from my chin to my eye-- a tongue?

My pleads grew louder, until tears spilled forth. ‚ÄúWhy are you being so cruel!?,‚Äù I sobbed. ‚ÄúYou were my best friend, weren't you?‚Äù

I cowered with my hands over my head as the sheets continued to be ripped off the bed. The scratching was now deafening, and the windows shook like there was a bad storm outside. I felt the sensation of what seemed like hundreds of hands all petting and pulling at me, and I was helpless as I curled tighter and tighter into a ball.

‚ÄúPlease stop--‚Äù I gasped, my sobs uncontrollable at this point. And somehow, it did. All at once, the room grew eerily still. I couldn't even hear crickets outside. It was just me and my own sobbing. Slowly, I uncurled myself, shivering as I looked around. Nothing was out of place. The paint should have been peeled off the walls with how violent that scratching was, and yet it wasn't. 

Mustering up every ounce of courage I could, got out of bed and peeked under. Nothing. 

‚ÄúWh-what the fuck, Luka?!,‚Äù I sobbed, dropping to my knees. ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù

The radio crackled. The song? 

‚ÄúBoys Don't Cry‚Äù.

Was he making fun of me? It felt like salt in the wound. 

I didn't even ask Diego to borrow his truck, I just had to get out of there. That brings me to now, feeling somewhat calmer. I'm typing this on my phone in a Waffle House, waiting for Rosette to return my call. If anyone knows what I'm dealing with, please let me know.

And what if they ARE Carlin?¬† Carlin manages to rise from her sick bed long enough to head over to the Boutique for a photo shoot after reading here that folks don‚Äôt even think she owns the place anymore.¬† She and Whitney twirl around in some overpriced sun dresses and pretend to know and like the women who actually run the store and then head off to brunch with Ellie.¬† This photo shoot just happens to line up with a Cash and Carry sale happening in Mid-March where the Bates will all be on hand to kiss babies, sign autographs and keep followers fooled so they keep buying this trash fashion.¬† Carlin comments on the Cash and Carry post and it‚Äôs the first time she has interacted with the Boutique since the holidays.¬† We find out that as she turns 11 weeks pregnant, her cravings are out of control and Evan has to attempt to make pancakes in the evening with Zade, who should be in bed.¬† Zade gets to stay up late for pancake content and to sell some fruit pouches and a Hydrojug.¬† Carlin also drops more pictures from her baby announcement photo shoot of the family in an all-white room wearing mostly beige clothing.¬† In the weekly vlog they reveal the pregnancy to Kelly Jo and Gil separately, the kids, Lawson and Tiffy, Whitney and Zach and Evan‚Äôs parents.¬† Everyone over acts and pretends this is not a third pregnancy.¬† Carlin has pregnancy baited for over a year by telling us all how much Layla wanted a baby sister, but the camera never lies and Layla needs several takes to act out the excitement her parents want.¬† Zade is trying to communicate but no one is backing up the few speech lessons he has had and bless his heart, he is just unintelligible without the ever present subtitles.¬† Layla isn‚Äôt much clearer and even though Carlin went to Target to buy baby items to ‚Äúhelp them make a connection‚Äù‚Ä¶ the entire thing ends up with the kids thinking they are getting 2 babies and one of them is for sure a boy bc everything Carlin bought is blue.¬† Evan talks to the camera while Carlin is on the phone with her doctor and there appears to be a third camera person in the reflection of the mirror‚Ä¶. Just in case you ever doubted that their entire home is a soundstage. Evan goes to a UT basketball game in his ongoing quest to be a man, but hurries home to gift the kids stuffed animals and balls from the game.¬† Layla and Zade need a lot more these days to be ‚ÄúSO ‚ÄòCITED‚Äù than just some concession stand junk and the whole thing ends up being an ad for pajamas.¬† 29 weeks to go‚Ä¶




2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†Katie Clark says she had never been to a concert until last week when she went to a Contemporary Christian show with Travis.¬† They get to go backstage to meet the star and Katie snaps a picture of Travis and says how ‚Äúproud‚Äù she is of him for talking with this performer.¬† Again, scouring the content for a reason to show ‚Äúpride‚Äù in these husbands is not an easy task.¬† Anyway, there is a poster of Phineas and Ferb in the background and Travis and this dude are basically doppelgangers of them.¬† She also shares pictures from Miles Balka‚Äôs first birthday where only the big 3 cousins, plus Zach and Whit‚Äôs kids and Aunt Michael attended.¬† Hailey got to let out her aggression by coloring all over the apartment walls so that Katie could shill for Magic Erasers and then they head over to the new studio‚Ä¶ I mean, house, to pretend clean while selling more products.¬† The rugs have finally arrived to warm up the stark whiteness of the place and of course Katie has a partnership with a rug company.¬† The rugs are from the Paris Hilton line and are different shades of‚Ä¶ no color whatsoever.¬† Anytime Katie gets a big sponsor, she gives away something to up the engagement on the post, and this time it‚Äôs a nugget ice maker.¬† They stock the pantry with a partner‚Äôs food and also sell a vacuum making that new house officially an Amazon storefront.¬† Hailey gets to ride her new jeep around in the empty garage before they head off to Jersey for PopPop Clark‚Äôs open heart surgery.¬† Their weekly vlog is filmed in Jersey and shows Travis‚Äô entire family coming together for his dad‚Äôs procedure.¬† They decide to spend some quality family time together‚Ä¶ at the mall.¬† The surgery gets moved to Friday instead of Wednesday and you can almost hear Katie gasp as she realizes she can‚Äôt beat a hasty retreat back down South.¬† Travis updates everyone later that his dad made it through the surgery just fine and it wasn‚Äôt as intensive as they first thought it might be.¬† Once the surgery is over‚Ä¶ Katie can get back to slinging links and shows us Hailey scrolling on an iPad like a pro picking out a show to watch on the Christian streaming service they are all shilling these days.¬† Baby Harvey shows up as a guest star and rolls over a few times to help mom keep engagement up.



¬†
3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Josie Balka likes to work out in her pool noodle and that is never going to change.¬† This week, after her workout, we see her coat her hair in $50 hair oil before slicking it all back in a pony and heading out to take the girls to swim lessons.¬† Showing her children in swim suits is also never going to change.¬† Josie hasn‚Äôt promoted her Effortless Beauty Shop in a hot minute, and the days of the huge blow out curls seem to be coming to an end.¬† She‚Äôs in a straight pony all week as she sells grocery delivery, meat sticks, tinted moisturizer and prepackaged meals. Josie seems to have plenty of free time during the week even though she is a mom of 3‚Ä¶ this week she heads out to a Pilates class with a friend.¬† She is always late and breathless‚Ä¶ but always has time to sit in her car and talk to her phone.¬† After Pilates our tradwife queen gets a date night with KTron and the very next day, she is off to brunch and shopping for new glasses.¬† Josie sprinkles stories in between ads and lately, it‚Äôs been all about her latte art.¬† The art has improved from looking like female anatomy to looking like‚Ä¶ male anatomy?? Not sure, but she seems super proud of herself.¬† She is back in the car to sell Erin‚Äôs beef fat lotion and Nurtrafol before taking pictures of herself in different glasses and asking her followers to help her pick a frame.¬† Points to Josie for showing her kids about 20% less than her other siblings‚Ä¶ but points take away because when she does show them they are in leotards, bathing suits or having hair and makeup done.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Alyssa Webster really wanted folks to think she was making some big changes down in that fundie jail she survives in‚Ä¶ but seasoned snarkers knew it was all a ruse, and this week proved just that.¬† First up was the Sunday line up of the girls in matching dresses and baby Rhett in his old man pimp suit.¬† Double breasted polyester vests and clip on neck ties on babies should truly be illegal.¬† After her glorious Sunday line up, comes the thundering sadness of Monday and Alyssa hopped on IG to whine about her house being a ‚Äúdump‚Äù, the kids being pure ‚Äúchaos‚Äù and the rain outside.¬† To fix her mood, she chunks all 5 kids in the car and heads to the coffee shop where she buys herself a cup of liquid sugar and the kids get free whipped cream.¬† Once the sugar rush commences, she comes back on to IG and says she didn‚Äôt really mean to complain, that her life is perfect and wonderful and everyone is living good.¬† She had to clear up the narrative bc she needed to sell silk pillowcases.¬† She shows an absolute shaft wagon full of clothes piled on her bedroom floor and says she knows that ‚Äúno one cares‚Äù.¬† Alyssa means Addee and Ellie don‚Äôt care bc they no longer show up to Auntmom her kids and play indentured servant for her.¬† Later in the week the kids get to go to the car wash after another trip to the coffee shop.¬† The shop must have been running low on whipped cream so they all get free hats instead.¬† Alyssa shows us Allie hard at work cleaning up the messy car while the other siblings play in the back of the car and pose painfully advertising their mom‚Äôs favorite coffee shop.¬† The hats show up all week, including on Alyssa and it‚Äôs obvious that she is either bribing the local workers so the whipped cream keeps flowing, or hoping for a partnership with this NATIONAL CHAIN COFFEE SHOP.¬† Way to support local, Lyss.¬† The Websters have now worn these darn hats twice as long as any of them wore their OWN HATS they were attempting to sell.¬† Maci has to clock in to work for her mom by acting out a scene where she asks to spend her piggy bank money to get a lemonade.¬† Alyssa then takes her to‚Ä¶you guessed it‚Ä¶ the coffee spot for a milkshake.¬† Doesn‚Äôt matter that it‚Äôs not what Maci asked for.¬† Alyssa is on a mission and no coin is safe until she secures it.¬† Maci will happily drink anything just to get her mother and that phone out of her face.¬† Baby girl is terrified.¬† Alyssa is putting out as much content as ever and shows Rhett and the girls playing outside at the park, on the sidewalk and her workout in the hot garage.¬† She also sells the healthy gummies again this week and shows some of the girls begging for them as she chunks them their way while reading the script in her monotone voice.¬† Talking to the phone in the car seems to be a Bates theme lately, and Alyssa does it with all of the kids in the back.¬† Poor Lexi tries to duck, dive and hide from the camera as Alyssa drones on telling her audience that Allie is on a trip to Texas with John to visit some family members.¬† Allie got to go because she is ten, Alyssa says.¬† Soooo John left his entire family to go on another trip solo and takes the oldest, easiest child with him, leaving her behind to struggle with the younger 4?¬† Doesn‚Äôt that sound awesome?¬† A friend of Alyssa‚Äôs drags her out of the house and takes them all to Sea World (thanks home school scholarship) and Alyssa makes it seem as though she has been through hell rather than a day at a theme park.¬† The biggest thing Alyssa features is her pigtails, which she is tremendously proud of.¬† She says over and over again that she ‚Äúknows no one cares‚Äù‚Ä¶ it seems so telling that she needs to preface everything with this Debbie Downer Disclaimer.¬† Warden is in town to head to the theme park with her, and he gets to carry Prince Rhett around on his shoulders.¬† Please remember that all of this content is shared through a dysmorphia inducing filter‚Ä¶ and that isn‚Äôt even all.¬† Instagram is no longer scratching that attention itch, so Alyssa is back on YouTube.¬† After saying a heavy, sad goodbye on January 3rd and blaming it all on Allie, 2 months later they are back.¬† Now, they did say that they would possibly share ‚Äúspecial events‚Äù, but do we really consider spending one night in John‚Äôs family‚Äôs back yard special?¬† The Websters are calling this a camping trip but it‚Äôs just really more insight into the kid mill they are running.¬† They head out to the same piece of land they gather at for Easter, where Alyssa directs Lurch on how to set up a tent.¬† The kids are wandering around aimlessly with no toys in sight.¬† They make a fire, eat a hot dog and some sketchy chicken skewers, and then Alyssa orders them all to bed in a line with strict instructions.¬† The next morning, they eat breakfast just as she instructs, and then that‚Äôs it.¬† Baby Rhett has been trained to plaster on a stinky face fake smile every time Alyssa turns her phone on him, so that is ALL the kid is giving.¬† He barely talks and the other girls seem lost and confused. BUT, Momma got her footage.¬† I hope John and Alyssa watch the Ruby Franke documentary, because‚Ä¶.whew‚Ä¶



¬†
5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Whitney Bates takes Kaci to work with her this week.¬† That includes a trip to Target, promoting an energy powder, meat sticks, and talking to us as she drives along with the daughter in the car.¬† She reposts Zach‚Äôs story showing him cooking in one of his real estate listings.¬† He is trying to sell a 1.6 million dollar lake home and feels the best way to do that is to splatter grease, cheese and mayo all over the gourmet kitchen. Zach also shows up on IG with Callie and says she will be joining him in the kitchen.¬† He wants folks to ask questions to the youngest Bates daughter and the oldest Bates‚Ä¶ but first we get a q and a with Kelly Jo.¬† Kelly Jo is a giggling mess during these as she tries to laugh at all of Zach‚Äôs dad jokes and bravado.¬† She tells us that I Love You Day will be super small this year, with none of the kids traveling home for it and that they may ditch the 50‚Äôs theme and just dress nicely and have dinner.¬† She says she buys everything and promotes everything her kids sell whether she needs it or not and Gil doesn‚Äôt like that.¬† Zach makes her visibly wince when he says they were ‚Äúflat broke growing up‚Äù.¬† Zach also says that there are so many Bates on YouTube they are constantly telling each other‚Äôs news‚Ä¶and then promptly suckers Kelly Jo into giving away a huge hint that at a second baby is due in June.¬† The biggest tale told is when Kelly says she lost a tremendous amount of weight by ‚Äúcutting out sugary drinks‚Äù.¬† She says after her hospitalization her GOAL is to start exercising, which she has never done.¬† Soooo a middle aged mom of 19 suddenly slims down several sizes by merely cutting out soda?¬† I seem to have a jingle stuck in my head again‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúO-O-O-Ozem‚Ä¶.‚Äù (allegedly)¬† Anyway‚Ä¶ they also cook a meatloaf that they destroy and have to redo and don‚Äôt have the correct ingredients for-per usual- Zach even tells his audience to just read the recipe from the caption, so WHY would we watch him cook it again?¬† Whitney is thrilled to be heading to a Boutique photo shoot starring her and her fake BFF Carlin, and later she washes her car to promote the car buying app.¬† They don‚Äôt buy a new car, but the company is apparently fine with her hawking their product by cleaning up the car she already owns.¬† JebJud is with them for the weekend, and Whitney tells us again how much she just loves, loves, loves having absolutely NO plans.



¬†
6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lydia Bates is struggling to find content 25 weeks into the second longest pregnancy ever recorded.¬† She features baby Ryker taking off his socks, tells us she has been under the weather and shows off her latest Ultrasound.¬† Trace is nowhere to be found in any of her content.¬† Lydia takes a trip to a thrift store to shop for her soon to be infant daughter and shows off the used clothes haul.¬† She readily admits she never bought second hand for Ryker.¬† She comes home and crams them in the dresser without washing them and my cleanliness alarms are deafening.¬† Trace finally shows up late in the week and they take Ryker to a local park.¬† Lydia films Ryker on a jungle gym and laughs that he is ‚Äúscared of heights‚Äù.¬† Trace intervenes to help him ‚Äúman up‚Äù.¬† They manage a sponsor for their vlog so are able to drop a new episode.¬† The sponsor is a furniture company who have given them chairs for Janie and Bill, 2 new chairs for their house and now a new rocking recliner for the nursery.¬† They are hard at work trying to move things around to squeeze 2 babies into that walk in closet of a second bedroom.¬† Someone in the comments tells them they should move in to that room and give the 2 children the larger room.¬† We all know Trace won‚Äôt do that when he and Warden can build bunks straight to the ceiling if need be.¬† A child in the ‚ÄúMASTER‚Äù bedroom?¬† Never!¬† Beyond that they go car shopping and test drive a few models while Lydia smirks at the camera and plays with her hair and Trace tries his hardest not to get tongue-tied.

7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The tension is at an all-time high in a nondescript house in a golf course subdivision in Florida, where we find our former fundie princess filming everyday life.¬† Yes, Erin is back to posting and Chad ain‚Äôt happy.¬† In fact, he is SO unhappy he refuses to look up, smile or even acknowledge his wife who is cheerfully narrating her day.¬† Erin tells us Chad is working on their home school room by creating some ‚Äúbuilt ins‚Äù for her.¬† I don‚Äôt think she knows what that means bc what he is actually building is book cases.¬† She shows off his handy-work and raves over the muted color they have chosen and the stain on the wood.¬† Chad Paine isn‚Äôt making anything ‚Äúbuilt in‚Äù bc he knows at a moment‚Äôs notice it could be in the back of a U-Haul flying up i95.¬† Erin glosses over very mad Chad and shows us the kids tearing up the flowers and the shrubs as they find ways to ‚Äúplay‚Äù.¬† Erin also shows us the family heading in to church and a trip to visit their goats.¬† The goats seem happy enough and the kids get to gather some eggs while visiting their friends with the farm.¬† Apparently Chad the martyr is still writing his weekly devotionals on their website, and Erin features one where he talks about a friend passing away.¬† He pointedly says you can‚Äôt BUY real friendships.¬† You hear that Travis and Evan?¬† It soon becomes clear just why Erin is back to posting and pushing their website‚Ä¶ her beef fat lotion is back in stock.¬† Momma needs some cash.¬† Kelly Jo is the first to promote it and says it is her absolute favorite skin care‚Ä¶ never mind the fact that she just said in Zach‚Äôs q and a that she doesn‚Äôt use any skin care at all.¬† Josie also helps sell it, but says she is giving it to a friend‚Ä¶it is definitely not expensive enough to touch Josie Balka‚Äôs face.¬† As long as the beef fat is for sale‚Ä¶ we will see the Paine kids, pensive, thin and anxious as they are.



¬†
8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Michael reposts Carlin‚Äôs baby announcement and congratulates her sister.¬† Michael, you can charge more for babysitting 2 kids and an infant, hon.¬† She also shows us pictures from baby Miles‚Äô first birthday party and it appears Tori nor Trace and families were there. Kelly Jo shows us that Brandon‚Äôs parents are in town and we see a picture of them all together.¬† She says JebJud considers them their second parents and that seems really telling.¬† Over in Keilen Corner, Michael finally debuts her cooking show.¬† It‚Äôs edited perfectly, less than ten minutes in length and everything is clean, neat, orderly and prepared.¬† She has pre-chopped, diced and even has overhead shots.¬† The food is basic and boring, but Brandon knows his audience and Zach should watch out.¬† At the end of the week, Michael travels to Florida, and Erin posts a picture of her with the Paine kids.

9.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†Before getting flamed on TikTok by the Red Flag Guy this week, Lawson and Tiffy dropped another cringy reel featuring ‚Äúdumb‚Äù woman and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù man.¬† Tiffy says that even though she has 7 years of college, Lawson is a million times smarter than she is.¬† The very fact that she SAID THIS tells me it is true.¬† What a terrifying thought.¬†They have a second YouTube vlog where they answer questions they have asked themselves. It‚Äôs basically an opportunity to pregnancy bait their audience. Lawson‚Äôs sage dating advice is that ‚Äú10s attract 10s‚Äù‚Ä¶¬†Tiffy lists her favorite people and the only Bates to make the cut is Addee. Baby Will‚Äôs new mode of transportation is a back carrier that only Lawson wears and it‚Äôs honestly a lot safer than being held in his dad‚Äòs arms because Lawson insists on throwing the child around like a sack of potatoes.  The rest of their week is spent at the zoo‚Ä¶ where the baby pulls his sun hat off and Lawson calls him defiant‚Ä¶ and rescuing a turtle from what Lawson describes as a busy road‚Ä¶ But the camera shows one car pass the entire time‚Ä¶ They put the turtle in a ditch and pat themselves on the back for their amazing content.  Lawson is still selling mix tiles and he has to be the only male Bates who scored that sponsorship‚Ä¶ Tiffany doesn‚Äôt show up in his ads at all.  In an effort to drum up some excitement, Tiffany shares a clip of her starring on an episode of Hannah Montana‚Ä¶ Not to be out done Lawson sings to the baby‚Ä¶ The baby continues to fear growing up.




        10. Bits and Bytes‚Ä¶ Zach has a new sponsorship selling pans and olive oil‚Ä¶. This week the siblings have all made it a point to comment on each other‚Äôs ad posts‚Ä¶The Double Date Podcast announced that it was postponing the premiere due to ‚Äúfamily illness‚Äù‚Ä¶ BSB has a huge markdown of Winter items and things that were once $65 are now $11-14‚Ä¶ KJ is back in SC helping with Poppa Bill.

It‚Äôs consumption conception for compensation.¬† Carlin kicks off the week with a pregnancy q and a where she answers pretend questions in order to push links.¬† At just 10 weeks pregnant, she tells us she has been very sick and that the baby was planned (by their financial advisor). She reposts the vlog in a reel format on IG to once again show her swishing a pregnancy test around in a cup of urine and then rubbing her fingers all over her face and mouth.¬† The comments are unhinged with debates on the safety of an epidural after her seizures, fans saying they are crying and sobbing with her and Josie, Kelly Jo and Joy Duggar all commenting that a positive pregnancy test is the ‚Äúbest feeling in the world‚Äù‚Ä¶. As if we expected members of the quiverfull movement to say anything else. A positive pregnancy test is like catnip to Alyssa and she comes out of hiding to ‚Äúlike‚Äù the post. Evan is featured as Dad of the century for brushing Layla‚Äôs hair as Carlin thanks him from her sick bed for ‚Äúhelping‚Äù because she can barely do anything she is so sick and says this has been a terrible pregnancy.

Debbie Downer Disclaimer.¬† Warden is in town to head to the theme park with her, and he gets to carry Prince Rhett around on his shoulders.¬† Please remember that all of this content is shared

3rd and blaming it all on Allie, 2 months later they are back.¬† Now, they did say that they would possibly share ‚Äúspecial events‚Äù, but do we really consider spending one night in John‚Äôs family‚Äôs back yard special?¬† The Websters are calling this a camping trip but it‚Äôs just really more insight into the kid mill they are running.¬† They head out to the same piece of land they gather at for Easter, where Alyssa directs Lurch on how to set up a tent.¬† The kids are wandering around aimlessly with no toys in sight.¬† They make a fire, eat a hot dog and some sketchy chicken skewers, and then Alyssa orders them all to bed in a line with strict instructions.¬† The next morning, they eat breakfast just as she instructs, and then that‚Äôs it.¬† Baby Rhett has been trained to plaster on a stinky face fake smile every time Alyssa turns her phone on him, so that is ALL the kid is giving.¬† He barely talks and the other girls seem lost and confused. BUT, Momma got her footage.¬† I hope John and Alyssa watch the Ruby Franke documentary, because‚Ä¶.whew‚Ä¶

I (19f) live with one of my best friends (20f). We‚Äôre in college and met last year. We lived with another one of my closest friends, but she transferred after fall semester so it‚Äôs just us. We both have very different schedules but we spend the majority of our free time together. She recently started a new job at a yoga studio and started getting her yoga instructor license which is eating up a lot of her time. She‚Äôs been really overwhelmed recently, but so have I with my job and school. So we‚Äôre both really busy. 

Last weekend, I asked her, my girlfriend whom she‚Äôs grown close with, and our old roommate to all go to a movie together this past Friday night. My roommate and I were talking on Friday morning about what time we should go when she realized that she has work until 8:45pm instead of 7:30 like she initially told me. I suggested going to an 8:50 showing, that way she‚Äôd only miss some previews and we wouldn‚Äôt be out late because I had to get to work at 7:30am. She said no and that she would be really stressed trying to get from the yoga study to the movie on time. I was kinda like‚Ä¶lol why? But then she got kinda upset and just told me to go without her. I was disappointed obviously because I was excited to spend time with all of them. 

After that very brief conversation, this is where I think I messed up. She had asked my girlfriend to go study with her at a coffee shop, and then asked me to join them. My girlfriend told me that she had to tell my roommate to invite me, which I thought was weird. Like, why do you want to spend time with my girlfriend and not me knowing that I don‚Äôt have class and have homework to do? So after the movie convo, I went back to tell her this. I basically just said ‚Äúit makes me sad that you asked my gf to hang out and not me‚Äù but kinda rudely. But still, it‚Äôs how I feel. She burst into tears at this and went to her room. This was Friday morning. 

Now it‚Äôs Sunday night. She hasn‚Äôt come home all weekend and she blocked me on text, Snapchat, and instagram. I realized this in the middle of my shift yesterday (which was horrible, and she obviously knew I was in the middle of my workday) and texted her friend to see what was going on. After I did that, my roommate dmed me on TikTok ( the only place she doesn‚Äôt have me blocked) to tell me not to involve her friend. 

I‚Äôve been agonizing over this all weekend. She has mental health issues and is extremely sensitive, which I understand and have always tried to be cautious of. I love her, she‚Äôs my best friend and obviously we live together. We also have already signed a lease together. I‚Äôm just genuinely at a loss. I definitely didn‚Äôt handle the situation correctly, but I didn‚Äôt think it warranted this reaction??? Someone please weigh in here. I can‚Äôt keep calling my mom about it. Thank you.

I popped one in, took a sip of water, and immediately regretted all my life choices. At first I thought it was tolerable and maybe I could deal with it, but it was like licking a bath bomb. And the taste kept building in my mouth even after I spit and rinsed.

Then I tried drinking coffee, water, and dousing my food in hot sauce to try to get rid of the taste in my mouth. But here I am two hours later feeling nauseated from the lingering floral mint flavor.

Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe none of this is real. But I need to tell someone, and this is the only option left I have to turn to. My name is Shawn, let me take you back to when it all started.

At twenty-five, I thought I had it all figured out. Ash and I were high school sweethearts, you know, the kind of love story people write movies about. When I slipped that ring on her finger, the whole world seemed to glow. And the wedding? God, she was radiant. Even her mom outshone every star in the sky that night. I couldn‚Äôt remember a lot about my childhood, I guess in a way that pushed me towards building a whole new family. 

Then life decided to throw its first curveball. One wrong move at my union job, and suddenly I was trapped in physical therapy, watching the weeks blur into months. The bills started piling up like the autumn leaves, and that's when the cracks began to show. Ash picked up extra shifts at a local store, while I... well, I found comfort at the bottom of a bottle. I should've known better, but I didn‚Äôt.

And that's not the worst part. Not by a long shot. No this seems like a minuscule compared to what I‚Äôm preparing to tell you. 

The divorce papers came as no surprise. Neither did losing the house. Ash deserved better than what I'd become, and I couldn't blame her for saving herself. So there I was, another statistic, another failed marriage, another guy starting over in the city. Found myself a one bedroom apartment ‚Äì you know how it goes, when the city folk flood into the suburbs, us working stiffs can sometimes catch a break on rent in the city. Waiting until they decide to come back and then my rent will be fucked. 

Living alone was a big struggle. Twenty-five years old, and I'd never really been by myself before. Not as far as I could remember anyway.

Everything was going as well as it could be at the new place, adjusting was difficult. Unfortunately though, I started to feel very deeply alone. No surprise, I knew there‚Äôd be a sort of grieving period when moving in on my own. But it became mind numbing.

Silence became my enemy. Strange, since I once craved those peaceful moments, but then the quiet felt like a black hole, swallowing everything that once made life worth living. The apartment groaned at night, and each sound was a cruel reminder, no more midnight ""Daddy"" whispers, no pitter-patter of sleepy feet down the hall. I've never felt more alone than in that king-size bed, a vast wasteland where Ash's warmth used to be.

Sometimes I forgot, just for a second. I'd turn to share something funny I saw on my phone with her, my lips already forming the words before reality crashes back, there's only empty space where she should be. Our wedding photo lied buried in a box I couldn‚Äôt bear to touch, along with Emma's messy finger paintings and Jack's worn baseball mitt, artifacts of a life I couldn‚Äôt bear live anymore. My hands still search for them in the dark, muscle memory refusing to accept what my heart knows.

Mornings were just motions. Coffee tasted like ash, breakfast is a symphony of silence, and Ash's chair mocks me from across the table, her half-finished crosswords forever frozen in time. I've started talking to myself, desperate to hear something, anything.

But weekends... God, the weekends are just endless. No sideline cheering at soccer games, no blanket forts during family movie nights, no kitchen chaos with pancake batter everywhere and sticky-faced kids giggling at the table. Three months in this place, and it was still just a shell with furniture. Home was wherever they were, which meant I was left in that husk, suffocating in all that goddamn quiet.

One memory surfaced tonight, cutting through decades of fog. I was small, nestled in my mother's lap, and for the first time since... well, since everything, I could see her. Really see her. Her hair caught the light like copper wire, waves cascading past her shoulders, and her hazel eyes shifted colors like autumn leaves in a stream - brown to green to something almost blue. Her fingers worked through my hair, gentle at first, until her words turned that tenderness into something else entirely.

""There are places,"" she whispered, her voice like honey over broken glass, ""where existence itself... changes. Not empty, exactly. More like a space between spaces, where everything we know just... stops.""

I twisted in her lap to look up at her, but her eyes were fixed on something far beyond our living room walls.

""We could reach it, you know. Leave everything behind, all the weight, all the darkness that follows us. And there are things there, beings that could show us the way. They don't belong in our world, but they understand the paths between.""

""Like monsters?"" My child's voice seemed to echo strangely in the memory.

She flinched, just slightly. ""No, more like... guides. They could take us somewhere safe. Somewhere where pain can't follow. Just you and me, in the right kind of nothing.""

""Would we be safe, mom?""

""Like we've always‚Äî"" Her voice crackled like static, her attempt at my name fragmenting into impossible sounds. ""‚Äîwanted.""

The memory releases me, dropping me back into my empty living room like a stone into dark water. Something about that conversation feels wrong, twisted, like a door that shouldn't exist in a familiar hallway. Why surface now, after all these years? Is it connected to my blank space, that yawning chasm between my thirteenth year, when my mother was attacked and I vanished, and my inexplicable return?

The therapists called it trauma response, this wall between me and my past. But this memory... I must have been nine, maybe ten. It's the first glimpse I've ever had of the time before, and now that I've seen it, something has changed.

My house started feeling wrong ever since that moment. The shadows don't just darken the corners anymore, they pulse with a sick, hungry rhythm. Each time I lift my beer, they seem to ripple, as if breathing. The emptiness has weight now, pressing against my ribs until each breath becomes a struggle. Something flickers just beyond my vision, too quick to catch but too deliberate to dismiss.

And I know, with a certainty that turns my blood to ice, that I'm being watched. The shadows have eyes. They've always had eyes. In crowds, in empty rooms, in the quiet moments between heartbeats - they're listening. Waiting. And somehow, I think they've been waiting since that conversation in my mother's lap, patient as only the truly ancient can be.

The first few incidents were subtle enough to doubt. My bedroom door, which I'd sworn I'd closed, would be cracked open at midnight, a sliver of darkness peering in. Then came the drawers, gaping open like hungry mouths when I'd return home. 

Cups vanished from countertops, only to appear days later in impossible places. The TV developed a mind of its own, crackling to life in the dead of night, its screen casting blue light across my walls, but the moment my footsteps approached, it would die, an electric wheeze following the darkness the empty screen brought.

The door incidents escalated. No longer content with subtle cracks, I'd wake to find it thrown wide open, as if something had burst through while I slept. I searched every inch of my house, my closet, under my bed, the tiny gap behind the water heater, convinced someone had taken up residence in my walls. But the apartment is small, not much room for people to hide, only shadows that seemed to deepen with each passing day.

Then, just as suddenly as hell broke loose, everything went still. The silence that followed wasn't peace though, it was worse. I tried to convince myself it was over, desperately clinging to that thought as days melted into weeks. Life took on same facade of normalcy I had before, wake up, work, come home, lose myself in mindless reality shows until sleep came.

I caught myself talking more and more to an empty apartment, I guess it had become a habit. Maybe it was the loneliness.

That Friday night, three bottles of beer deep into a game show marathon, I felt almost normal again. The contestant on screen fumbled an answer so obvious it might as well have been written in neon. A laugh bubbled up from my chest, loose and genuine.

""Idiot,"" I snorted, shaking my head at the TV. ""That was an easy question.""

The response that followed, the response I didn‚Äôt expect, came from just behind my left ear.

""Hey.""

The whisper slithered into my ear like ice water down my spine. I whipped around, heart thundering against my ribs. Empty room. Just the TV's laughter echoing and my ragged breathing.

""Hey.""

Closer this time. Intimate. As if something had pressed its lips right against my ear. I launched myself off the couch, fists clenched so tight my nails cut half-moons into my palms. ""Who the fuck is there?!""

The voice that answered wasn't human. It used my words, but wrong, like someone had recorded my voice and played it backward but it warped. ""Who the fuck is there?!"" it rasped, a wet, guttural mockery of my own terror.

I immediately called the cops. But they were useless. They swept through my house with flashlights and condescending smiles, finding nothing but a man they clearly thought was losing his mind. Maybe I was. The look in their eyes, that mixture of pity and professional detachment, told me everything I needed to know about how I sounded.

The activity resurged with vengeance. I tried escaping to bars, surrounding myself with the white noise of humanity, but it followed. Drinks would leap from tables when no one was near. My wallet would slip from my pocket again and again, no matter how securely I tucked it away. My keys would migrate across tables when I looked away, as if pulled by invisible strings. I stopped going out, terrified that whatever haunted me might attach itself to someone else.

I knew I couldn't keep waiting, letting whatever it was continue to torment me. So I made a choice‚Äîone I'd soon add to my ever-growing list of regrets. I called my father. Our relationship was complicated enough, but ever since I came back, he'd become something else entirely. A shell. A ghost wearing my father's face.

The phone rang once. Twice. Then a voice, unfamiliar.

""Hello, this is nurse Hannah at [redacted] Nursing Home. How may I help you?""

My throat tightened. ""This is Shawn [redacted]. I need to speak with my father, Austin [redacted].""

""One moment. Connecting you to room 12.""

The line crackled, and then‚Äî

""Who‚Äîwho the hell is this?"" My father's voice, raw and hostile.

""Dad? I need to‚Äî""

""Son?"" His tone shifted, broke. ""My son died a decade ago. Him and my wife both. Gone.""

Ice spread through my chest. ""Dad, I didn't die. I'm right here, talking to you. It's Shawn.""

""That's not my son's name!"" He was shouting now. ""My boy was Noah!""

""Please, Dad."" I pressed my fingers against my temple. ""Not this again. I just need Mom's maiden name. Maybe track down some family I never knew about.""

""Diane?"" His voice softened at her name. ""Her brother Kent lives out in the sticks. Weird one, that man.""

My pulse quickened. ""Kent who?""

He growled, low and angry, before spitting out: ""[redacted].""

""Thanks, Dad.""

""My son is dead, damn it!"" I hung up before he could spiral further. He'd been like this since I returned‚Äîscreaming that I wasn't his son, inventing this ""Noah"" person. I tried not to dwell on it, told myself it was just trauma talking. But sometimes, in the dark of night, his words would echo in my head.

Living alone was a big struggle. Twenty-five years old, and I'd never really been by myself before. Not as far as I could remember anyway.

Everything was going as well as it could be at the new place, adjusting was difficult. Unfortunately though, I started to feel very deeply alone. No surprise, I knew there‚Äôd be a sort of grieving period when moving in on my own. But it became mind numbing.

Silence became my enemy. Strange, since I once craved those peaceful moments, but then the quiet felt like a black hole, swallowing everything that once made life worth living. The apartment groaned at night, and each sound was a cruel reminder, no more midnight ""Daddy"" whispers, no pitter-patter of sleepy feet down the hall. I've never felt more alone than in that king-size bed, a vast wasteland where Ash's warmth used to be.

Sometimes I forgot, just for a second. I'd turn to share something funny I saw on my phone with her, my lips already forming the words before reality crashes back, there's only empty space where she should be. Our wedding photo lied buried in a box I couldn‚Äôt bear to touch, along with Emma's messy finger paintings and Jack's worn baseball mitt, artifacts of a life I couldn‚Äôt bear live anymore. My hands still search for them in the dark, muscle memory refusing to accept what my heart knows.

Mornings were just motions. Coffee tasted like ash, breakfast is a symphony of silence, and Ash's chair mocks me from across the table, her half-finished crosswords forever frozen in time. I've started talking to myself, desperate to hear something, anything.

But weekends... God, the weekends are just endless. No sideline cheering at soccer games, no blanket forts during family movie nights, no kitchen chaos with pancake batter everywhere and sticky-faced kids giggling at the table. Three months in this place, and it was still just a shell with furniture. Home was wherever they were, which meant I was left in that husk, suffocating in all that goddamn quiet.

One memory surfaced tonight, cutting through decades of fog. I was small, nestled in my mother's lap, and for the first time since... well, since everything, I could see her. Really see her. Her hair caught the light like copper wire, waves cascading past her shoulders, and her hazel eyes shifted colors like autumn leaves in a stream - brown to green to something almost blue. Her fingers worked through my hair, gentle at first, until her words turned that tenderness into something else entirely.

""There are places,"" she whispered, her voice like honey over broken glass, ""where existence itself... changes. Not empty, exactly. More like a space between spaces, where everything we know just... stops.""

I twisted in her lap to look up at her, but her eyes were fixed on something far beyond our living room walls.

""We could reach it, you know. Leave everything behind, all the weight, all the darkness that follows us. And there are things there, beings that could show us the way. They don't belong in our world, but they understand the paths between.""

""Like monsters?"" My child's voice seemed to echo strangely in the memory.

She flinched, just slightly. ""No, more like... guides. They could take us somewhere safe. Somewhere where pain can't follow. Just you and me, in the right kind of nothing.""

""Would we be safe, mom?""

""Like we've always‚Äî"" Her voice crackled like static, her attempt at my name fragmenting into impossible sounds. ""‚Äîwanted.""

The memory releases me, dropping me back into my empty living room like a stone into dark water. Something about that conversation feels wrong, twisted, like a door that shouldn't exist in a familiar hallway. Why surface now, after all these years? Is it connected to my blank space, that yawning chasm between my thirteenth year, when my mother was attacked and I vanished, and my inexplicable return?

The therapists called it trauma response, this wall between me and my past. But this memory... I must have been nine, maybe ten. It's the first glimpse I've ever had of the time before, and now that I've seen it, something has changed.

My house started feeling wrong ever since that moment. The shadows don't just darken the corners anymore, they pulse with a sick, hungry rhythm. Each time I lift my beer, they seem to ripple, as if breathing. The emptiness has weight now, pressing against my ribs until each breath becomes a struggle. Something flickers just beyond my vision, too quick to catch but too deliberate to dismiss.

And I know, with a certainty that turns my blood to ice, that I'm being watched. The shadows have eyes. They've always had eyes. In crowds, in empty rooms, in the quiet moments between heartbeats - they're listening. Waiting. And somehow, I think they've been waiting since that conversation in my mother's lap, patient as only the truly ancient can be.

The first few incidents were subtle enough to doubt. My bedroom door, which I'd sworn I'd closed, would be cracked open at midnight, a sliver of darkness peering in. Then came the drawers, gaping open like hungry mouths when I'd return home. 

Cups vanished from countertops, only to appear days later in impossible places. The TV developed a mind of its own, crackling to life in the dead of night, its screen casting blue light across my walls, but the moment my footsteps approached, it would die, an electric wheeze following the darkness the empty screen brought.

The door incidents escalated. No longer content with subtle cracks, I'd wake to find it thrown wide open, as if something had burst through while I slept. I searched every inch of my house, my closet, under my bed, the tiny gap behind the water heater, convinced someone had taken up residence in my walls. But the apartment is small, not much room for people to hide, only shadows that seemed to deepen with each passing day.

Then, just as suddenly as hell broke loose, everything went still. The silence that followed wasn't peace though, it was worse. I tried to convince myself it was over, desperately clinging to that thought as days melted into weeks. Life took on same facade of normalcy I had before, wake up, work, come home, lose myself in mindless reality shows until sleep came.

I caught myself talking more and more to an empty apartment, I guess it had become a habit. Maybe it was the loneliness.

That Friday night, three bottles of beer deep into a game show marathon, I felt almost normal again. The contestant on screen fumbled an answer so obvious it might as well have been written in neon. A laugh bubbled up from my chest, loose and genuine.

""Idiot,"" I snorted, shaking my head at the TV. ""That was an easy question.""

The response that followed, the response I didn‚Äôt expect, came from just behind my left ear.

""Hey.""

The whisper slithered into my ear like ice water down my spine. I whipped around, heart thundering against my ribs. Empty room. Just the TV's laughter echoing and my ragged breathing.

""Hey.""

Closer this time. Intimate. As if something had pressed its lips right against my ear. I launched myself off the couch, fists clenched so tight my nails cut half-moons into my palms. ""Who the fuck is there?!""

The voice that answered wasn't human. It used my words, but wrong, like someone had recorded my voice and played it backward but it warped. ""Who the fuck is there?!"" it rasped, a wet, guttural mockery of my own terror.

I immediately called the cops. But they were useless. They swept through my house with flashlights and condescending smiles, finding nothing but a man they clearly thought was losing his mind. Maybe I was. The look in their eyes, that mixture of pity and professional detachment, told me everything I needed to know about how I sounded.

The activity resurged with vengeance. I tried escaping to bars, surrounding myself with the white noise of humanity, but it followed. Drinks would leap from tables when no one was near. My wallet would slip from my pocket again and again, no matter how securely I tucked it away. My keys would migrate across tables when I looked away, as if pulled by invisible strings. I stopped going out, terrified that whatever haunted me might attach itself to someone else.

I knew I couldn't keep waiting, letting whatever it was continue to torment me. So I made a choice‚Äîone I'd soon add to my ever-growing list of regrets. I called my father. Our relationship was complicated enough, but ever since I came back, he'd become something else entirely. A shell. A ghost wearing my father's face.

The phone rang once. Twice. Then a voice, unfamiliar.

""Hello, this is nurse Hannah at [redacted] Nursing Home. How may I help you?""

My throat tightened. ""This is Shawn [redacted]. I need to speak with my father, Austin [redacted].""

""One moment. Connecting you to room 12.""

The line crackled, and then‚Äî

""Who‚Äîwho the hell is this?"" My father's voice, raw and hostile.

""Dad? I need to‚Äî""

""Son?"" His tone shifted, broke. ""My son died a decade ago. Him and my wife both. Gone.""

Ice spread through my chest. ""Dad, I didn't die. I'm right here, talking to you. It's Shawn.""

""That's not my son's name!"" He was shouting now. ""My boy was Noah!""

""Please, Dad."" I pressed my fingers against my temple. ""Not this again. I just need Mom's maiden name. Maybe track down some family I never knew about.""

""Diane?"" His voice softened at her name. ""Her brother Kent lives out in the sticks. Weird one, that man.""

My pulse quickened. ""Kent who?""

He growled, low and angry, before spitting out: ""[redacted].""

""Thanks, Dad.""

""My son is dead, damn it!"" I hung up before he could spiral further. He'd been like this since I returned‚Äîscreaming that I wasn't his son, inventing this ""Noah"" person. I tried not to dwell on it, told myself it was just trauma talking. But sometimes, in the dark of night, his words would echo in my head.

Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe none of this is real. But I need to tell someone, and this is the only option left I have to turn to. My name is Shawn, let me take you back to when it all started.

At twenty-five, I thought I had it all figured out. Ash and I were high school sweethearts, you know, the kind of love story people write movies about. When I slipped that ring on her finger, the whole world seemed to glow. And the wedding? God, she was radiant. Even her mom outshone every star in the sky that night. I couldn‚Äôt remember a lot about my childhood, I guess in a way that pushed me towards building a whole new family. 

Then life decided to throw its first curveball. One wrong move at my union job, and suddenly I was trapped in physical therapy, watching the weeks blur into months. The bills started piling up like the autumn leaves, and that's when the cracks began to show. Ash picked up extra shifts at a local store, while I... well, I found comfort at the bottom of a bottle. I should've known better, but I didn‚Äôt.

And that's not the worst part. Not by a long shot. No this seems like a minuscule compared to what I‚Äôm preparing to tell you. 

The divorce papers came as no surprise. Neither did losing the house. Ash deserved better than what I'd become, and I couldn't blame her for saving herself. So there I was, another statistic, another failed marriage, another guy starting over in the city. Found myself a one bedroom apartment ‚Äì you know how it goes, when the city folk flood into the suburbs, us working stiffs can sometimes catch a break on rent in the city. Waiting until they decide to come back and then my rent will be fucked.

I (25F) am a full time college student graduating this spring and moving immediately into a graduate program. I live with my family and work very roughly between 25-50 (sometimes more) hours per week. I do not pay rent as I live with family however, I am currently paying off student loans in very large chunks. Of course I also pay all of my own bills and groceries. Additionally, I am saving for a 2 month backpacking pilgrimage with a friend through Europe \~$7,000.¬†

I make \~$2,700/month. I spend \~$700-900 on gas, groceries, necessities, bills and an occasional outing/treat. I do my best to put the remaining \~$2,000 into savings (mainly Europe fund atm) and college. 

The pilgrimage is very important to me. Not that I need to justify it to anyone, I‚Äôve prayed about it a lot. I‚Äôm doing it for my faith, my relationship with Christ, getting in touch with history, entering Rome for the Jubilee and I‚Äôve worked very hard for it. I‚Äôve suffered greatly in my personal life and working hard for this trip has meant a lot to me‚Ä¶ It will be a miracle to see it come to fruition thanks be to God. 

About once a month I try to make an act of charity, not usually by way of money but through acts of service (like helping a friend, family member or stranger, buying someone's coffee, giving a ride, ect.). I help with Eucharistic ministry once a month and was curious if this could be considered a tithe? Especially with lent coming up, I have things like charity and tithing on my mind. I‚Äôve never really looked into tithing but I‚Äôm worried that I should?¬†

Without asking, a friend mentioned that I could offer my pilgrimage as a tithe so long I was going with the intention of praying for specific things (like the conversion of my family and friends, my future husband, ect.). Is this appropriate? Or things like this in general? Can I make a tithe each month by way of charitable acts or should it always be monetary? What is expected of me given my income, expenses and life circumstances that I should tithe?¬†

I don‚Äôt want to be stingy with my money, I want to give freely, lovingly and generously. However, working and being in college full time at such a great cost and with very little time, it is difficult‚Ä¶¬†

I am a Christian lesbian and my religion is really important to me and is personally something I don't foresee changing. However, I totally acknowledge the hurt others have experienced at the hand of religion, especially Christianity. This is most definitely true for those who are LGBTQ. 

Because of this, I don't ever want to continue the damage. I am theologically liberal and not a terf so I don't believe religion is an issue in the sense of making me an a-hole. 

I also don't want to ever force my religion onto someone else, which is why I think being with someone who is also religious or not struggling with religious trauma would be best for both sides. I never want to cause discomfort to anyone. However, my spirituality is important in that I pray a lot and read the Bible a lot and am trying  to get better about going to church. 

To be honest, my dream would be to be with someone who could go to church with me and also just share this part of my life with me. For example, Journaling and art are hobbies of mine and I have tied that with my faith. So I like to do paintings inspired by Bible verses and I also mail these as cards to elderly people from my childhood church who have no family or are sick. And I also like to read the Bible in coffee shops and make it all cute. It's just played a part of my life and has made me a better person. I do a lot of volunteer and charity as a part of my religion as well. 

So I would never want to be in a relationship where I am making someone else uncomfortable or in one where I resent the fact someone thinks I'm stupid for being religious. I don't care as much if someone believes or not but I really value mutual respect. And as someone trying to get into medical school, I would really hate to be seen as stupid because I work really hard not to be uneducated or unintelligent. I'm not a genius by any means but my ability to learn and think openly has been a source of confidence in my life so attacks to that really hurt. 

I guess my biggest fear is that me being a Christian may make is harder to date as a queer woman. I understand the LGBTQ community has suffered a lot at the hands of organized religion and that mistrust and dislike can remain. 

I also don't know how open to be about religion in the early dating phase? I don't want to come across as judgemental or disrespectful to those who aren't religous. 

And I dont know how picky I should be in terms of dating only within my religion or being open to those who are of other or no religion? 

I think sex would be the biggest area where it may matter. I am not a purity culture believer but waiting for a serious relationship is something I would prefer. Like at least wait until it's been a few months and I feel secure in a relationship. Marriage is something I would like, and I know others don't always seek that so that's also a potential area of disagreement. Im not strict about sex and I dont want to ever hold it above someone's head. On the flip side, I don't want a relationship where I feel pressured to have sex before I am ready. Waiting for marriage is already something I have learned will be impossible so it's not a standard I hold. And I should note that I am not ashamed of sex or think of it as dirty. In fact, I'm kinda a hopeless romantic who thinks it's beautiful. 

I just don't know the best way to navigate this all. Queer dating can be complicated enough when I have to figure out if a girl is into girls. Then I have to muster up the courage to make a move. And adding variables to an already small-ish dating pool can be challenging. So that is why I was hoping for advice on how much give and take is needed. And how to I approach this respectfully.

I literally can‚Äôt remember the last time I wrapped a whole standard sized towel around myself but today, it happened. I started in December at around 287 and last week in February I‚Äôm down to 259. 

I have a lot of conflicting feelings about losing weight. I‚Äôve always been prone to keeping weight on thanks to what are probably 100% Irish peasant genes which served my ancestors very well. My teen years were spent in the PEAK of the media portraying extremely normal looking women as morbidly obese, which fucked all millennial women up haha. 

Over the years I‚Äôve tried and failed to do all kinds of diets. I almost never eat fast food or sugars and don‚Äôt do a lot of processed foods.  I‚Äôd usually eat about two meals a day with a small breakfast and a big dinner. But I love carbs and cheese because they rock haha. 

It‚Äôs taken me probably ten years or more but I can genuinely say I am body positive and totally okay with being fat. I have fat on my body, just like everyone else. My health stats have always been impeccable. I spent a year working out for an hour and half 3x a week and never lost a pound but found a love of exercise and fitness. 

Then, in December at the age of 32 I was diagnosed with adhd and started on stimulant medication. It has completely changed my life around, specifically as it pertains to impulse control and dopamine. 

People who have adhd naturally have lower levels of dopamine, and a lot of people (especially kids) will self medicate or additionally medicate with sugar, but sweets have never really been my thing. But you know what is converted into sugar? Carbs. So when I‚Äôd start my morning with a coffee and a croissant, it was me unknowingly trying to boost my dopamine levels. When I smoked cigarettes (a stimulant) for years and years, same thing. And when I tried dieting by cutting out carbs, my body would panic and make up for it by impulsively binge eating everything in sight to try and regain that lost dopamine source. 

 Since getting on stimulants, I no longer impulsively reach for carbs. Instead, I crave protein. I‚Äôm not starving myself (which can definitely happen with a suppressed appetite) but my body‚Äôs needs have shifted now because the medication is providing the dopamine I used to have to get from foods. Now I drink protein shakes, eat salads, and say no when offered carbs or little treats not because it‚Äôs ‚Äúwrong‚Äù but because my body isn‚Äôt asking for it. 

For years I had to sit through well meaning lectures on ‚Äújust replace one meal a day with (whatever new fad is there)‚Äù or ‚Äúcount calories‚Äù or ‚Äúcalories in calories out‚Äù or the best one, ‚Äújust listen to your body.‚Äù

The thing is, I WAS listening to my body. My body needed dopamine, and food supplied it to me. No amount of white knuckling or calorie counting or intuitive eating would have solved it for me. 

I hope that as science of the brain expands, it will help solve a lot of the rhetoric of ‚Äúfat people are just lazy‚Äù or ‚Äúfat people just have no will power.‚Äù I am living proof that is not the case, especially considering I have had the will power to stop many addictions in the past, all except food ‚Äî until now. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk haha. Wearing a normal sized towel is surreal and pretty cool, and I‚Äôll continue loving my body in whatever form it comes in ‚Äî but I‚Äôm also excited now to be able to find clothes that aren‚Äôt just ugly af potato sacks or biz casual outfits made exclusively for someone who manages a neighborhood Wells Fargo bank hahaha.

1j250xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1j250xd/cultural_programming/,Cultural Programming,"Oh, now we‚Äôre diving into the real cultural programming. Everyone assumes sitcoms like The Simpsons, Seinfeld, and Friends and more were just harmless entertainment quirky characters, laugh tracks, and a comforting dose of escapism. But what if they weren‚Äôt just entertainment? What if they were carefully engineered tools of social conditioning, subtly shaping how we live, what we buy, and even how we think?

Look at the timeline. In the early 90s, as America was shifting away from the industrial age and into the era of consumerism and corporate dominance, we got a wave of sitcoms that defined our lifestyles. These weren‚Äôt just funny shows, they were cultural instruction manuals, teaching us how to behave, what to desire, and even what not to question.

Seinfeld, a show literally about nothing, yet it taught an entire generation that life is best spent being detached, cynical, and obsessed with petty grievances. It normalized a mindset where you don‚Äôt engage with the world in any meaningful way, you just observe and mock it. Instead of questioning authority or societal decay, we were trained to laugh at minor inconveniences and social awkwardness. Why fight the system when you can just complain about a bad date or a soup order?

Friends, what better way to push the urban consumerist fantasy? A show where a group of friends, who somehow afford massive apartments in NYC on barista and chef salaries, spend all their time hanging out, drinking coffee, and consuming. Think about how much product placement and lifestyle reinforcement went on everything from fashion trends to coffee culture to the idea that your social group should be the center of your universe. Not politics, not rebellion, not questioning anything bigger.

The Simpsons, on the surface, looks like satire mocking American life. But if you step back, it normalizes dysfunction. Homer is a bumbling idiot who somehow coasts through life with no consequences. The show trained us to see the decline of American family values, the incompetence of authority, and the corruption of corporations as funny rather than urgent problems to be solved. Sure, Mr. Burns is evil, but he‚Äôs also a punchline. Nothing changes, just sit back, laugh, and let the world burn.

This pattern isn‚Äôt accidental. Sitcoms didn‚Äôt just reflect reality, they shaped it. They conditioned us to aspire to certain lifestyles, accept certain norms, and internalize certain attitudes. Ever notice how people started dressing like sitcom characters, modeling their humor after them, even designing their homes and friendships around these artificial ideals? Ever wonder why no sitcoms really challenged the corporate system, the banking elite, or the real power structures? Because that was never their function. Their function was to pacify the masses, keep us entertained, distracted, and docile.

And it worked. Look at us now. Entire generations spent their formative years absorbing these shows, and what did we get? A society that mimics scripted television instead of challenging the script we‚Äôre actually living in. We became consumers, not revolutionaries. We measure life in laugh tracks, coffee orders, and pop culture references, not in personal agency or defiance.

So was this all just organic culture evolving, or was it engineered conditioning? Were we laughing because we enjoyed it, or because we were trained to? Maybe the joke was always on us.",15,1740958973.0,conspiracy,6,0.89,False

I'd like to preface this by saying I know I'm in the wrong. Nothing I did was done on purpose I just really fucked up.

We had a university dance event that everyone in our year went to, it was a really nice evening, the vibes were amazing and everyone was having a good time.

There was lots of drinking involved, everyone was getting very drunk and I joined in, however I fucked up and over did it.

I didn't eat before the event as I was so focused on getting everything ready (had to pick up a suit hire for it), and ended up getting too drunk.

Me, my friend and my girlfriends friend all got a bit too drunk, and whilst my girlfriend was drinking, she wasn't as bad as us, and so she had to get us back home.

She got us back home and I felt fucking horrible for putting her in that position, so we met up today and I bought her a coffee, and we walked around the beach just talking about it. She was joking about everything and saying things were fine, so I assumed they were.

That is until she texts tonight, I told her I was still feeling like a dick for what I did (it's been on my mind all day) and she agrees with me, and said she's low-key annoyed.

I call her and she said that the other two were fine as they are her friends and she didn't mind looking after them, but because I'm her boyfriend I should be the one looking out for everyone, and the fact she had to look after me made her feel like a mum.

She also said it was 'icky' which hurt but I understand where she's coming from, I really hate that I put her in that position.

I told her that I'd grow from it and if I'm gonna take anything away from this it's that I wanna become better from it, but she just said she needed space to think about it.

I just feel horrible, I hate that I made her feel like this, even unintentionally. I wanna make things right but I don't know how, I just really over did it last night and I feel nothing but regret and anger towards myself about it.",1,1740958712.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

I met with him at the coffee shop where I work part-time. He lives nearby and started showing up regularly. We got talking about life, culture, and hit it off. He‚Äôs a professor here and was already curious about Islam, which I didn‚Äôt expect.

After months of chats, told me he loved me and wanted to marry me. I was over the moon but freaked out, i told him I can only marry a Muslim, and my family might say no to a foreigner anyway. Then, out of nowhere, he said he‚Äôd been studying Islam, met an imam, and converted by saying the Shahada.
I set up a meeting with my dad and brothers, expecting a fight. But he spoke Arabic, showed respect, and they actually liked him. My dad said okay as long as he takes care of me, and my brothers didn‚Äôt push back. I was floored, they accepted it way faster than I thought. Now we‚Äôre planning somethings (gotta wait till I‚Äôm 25 for some legal rules here), and he‚Äôs fine staying in here.

I‚Äôm thrilled, but I‚Äôm also anxious about some things: 
Daily Life Stuff, he‚Äôs more used to American ways, big independence, casual vibes, and I‚Äôm from a tight knit family. How do we make this work day to day? Like, will he get frustrated with how much my family‚Äôs around, or me with his need for space?
Facing Judgment, I‚Äôm scared his family or friends might hate me for being Arab and Muslim or think I forced him to convert (I didn‚Äôt!). Have any of you dealt with pushback like that? How do I not take it personally if they‚Äôre cold to me?
His Side of the Family, He hasn‚Äôt told his parents yet, and I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll freak out about the conversion. How can I help him break the news, or prepare if they don‚Äôt like me?
I‚Äôm crazy about him, and I don‚Äôt want my background to screw this up. I just want us to be happy together. Any advice would mean the world, please keep it real with me. Thanks!

Hey Reddit, I need advice on handling a situation involving my close friend (Jake), the girl I‚Äôve been talking to (Mia), and my ex (Emma). I recently learned some new information about Jake that has made me question how to move forward in our friendship, and I‚Äôd appreciate some outside perspectives.

# Background

I met Jake in 2021 through my ex-best friend (Lena) when I was dating Emma. We had a solid friend group‚Äîme, Emma, Jake, Lena, and another friend, Sophia. Over time, things changed: Emma and I broke up in 2022, Lena had a falling out with me and Sophia, so it became just Jake, Sophia, and me hanging out.

In 2023, I started dating a new girl (Isabelle, 25F) and introduced her to Jake and Sophia. Everything was fine, and we all got along well. Fast forward to 2024, Jake and I joined a new friend group that went to music festivals regularly. In October, Mia joined the group. Jake found her attractive, so I played wingman for him‚Äîuntil Mia found out Jake had a girlfriend and confronted him about it.

Jake never told me about this, but he later admitted things wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere with Mia. Since I had been vibing with her, I asked if he‚Äôd be cool with me pursuing her, and he said yes. Over the next few months, Mia and I got close‚Äîwe FaceTimed regularly, I took her on a date around Christmas, and even after I moved from **State A** to **State B** in December, we stayed in touch.

# The Situation

A month ago, Mia told me something that changed how I saw Jake. She and Emma are from the same hometown friend group, and when Mia mentioned Jake to Emma, Emma casually mentioned that Jake had taken her out for coffee after our breakup. This caught me off guard because Jake and I had become really close over the last year, and he never mentioned this to me.

Mia was surprised I didn‚Äôt already know and asked me not to bring it up because she didn‚Äôt want to be involved in drama. I agreed, planning to handle it on my own. Since then, I‚Äôve been a bit distant from Jake but haven‚Äôt brought it up with him.

Recently, I vented to Mia about how much this bothered me, and she responded with something like, ""Why don‚Äôt you just talk to him directly?"" This confused me since she had previously asked me not to bring it up. When I reminded her, she said, ""Oh, right.""

At the same time, I‚Äôve noticed Jake and Mia still interact on social media, liking each other‚Äôs posts and sharing reels. Maybe it‚Äôs nothing, but given everything I‚Äôve learned, it makes me wonder if I‚Äôm handling this situation the right way. I also recently remembered that Jake had previously messaged Isabelle after our breakup‚Äînothing inappropriate, but enough that it now seems like a pattern.

# What I‚Äôm Considering

I‚Äôll be back in **State A** in two weeks and had already told Mia that I‚Äôd take her out on a date. However, after our last conversation, I feel like I may have been too emotionally open with her, and I‚Äôm re-evaluating how I approach my friendships moving forward.

I‚Äôm torn between two approaches:

1. **Not saying anything** and simply adjusting my boundaries, keeping my distance from Jake, and being more private about my personal life.
2. **Talking to Jake calmly** to hear his perspective and see if it‚Äôs worth addressing. Since it would just be a conversation between the two of us, I‚Äôm wondering if it makes sense to clear the air.",2,1740958307.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Me and my boyfriend started dating as we ended our senior year of high school (we were both 18) and after our first year of dating and visiting each other at work we started talking about on open relationship or adding another girl (I‚Äôm bi and have never been with a girl) long story short it didn‚Äôt happen because I was too insecure to let him go like that, I felt like he would find better and leave me. It‚Äôs cool and fine and we continue with the relationship. We moved in together almost a year ago now (we‚Äôve been together 3 years going on 4 in April) and we started talking about an open relationship again or adding someone to the bedroom. We both got on apps and started talking to people‚Ä¶..so I thought. It seems I had been talking to people (99% guys cause y‚Äôall know how that goes) and he got maybe 2 chats from girls. It hit his self esteem pretty hard and he got depressed and felt not good about himself. 
One night we have his friends over and are playing drinking games, well this was a naughty drinking game and ended with a 4some‚Ä¶.that happened a few more after that. One night it was happening he left the group to ‚Äúgo to bed‚Äù while the rest of us finished up. I finally go to grab my phone and clean up and there‚Äôs 8 missed calls (he was in the bedroom right next to us, there is a total of 2 doors in this apartment) and a bunch of texts, all of them pleading for me to please stop, come in the bedroom, stop, stop, please stop. I rushed into the bedroom to find him sobbing on the floor that I left him in there all by himself. I‚Äôm drunk and start crying because I didn‚Äôt mean to upset him, I love him and didn‚Äôt mean to hurt him (he had gotten so upset he punched the floor, which is concrete because we are the basement level) and we weren‚Äôt gonna be doing this anymore. 

He had given up on the apps and whatnot, claiming himself as unattractive and ugly, so I got off of them too because I felt guilty with 99+ messages from guys. (For context I never met with any of them and barely replied to any that I did message because he was my priority and I was too busy for anyone else) 
Well recently he‚Äôs gotten back into them which makes me a little happy cause maybe he feels a little better about himself, however he‚Äôs also gotten into shr00ms. He tried them for the first time after dinner on a week day (he could do so because he is switching jobs right now and just finished all the tests he needed to do for a license) and was fine, then came today aka Sunday. I was going to make myself coffee as I do on the weekends ( I only have those 2 days off btw, I don‚Äôt get to work from home like he does) and realized I was out of all my stuff, he volunteered to go to target with me, and told me he was planning on doing the mushies before we left, I told him no because they could kick in while we were shopping and I didn‚Äôt want to deal with that. He said fine but that he was going to take them when we got there. In the hustle and bustle of cleaning a bit before leaving, I forgot he said that. Timelapse to me parking and talking to him about I don‚Äôt even remember what, I realize he‚Äôs chewing something and I roll my eyes when I remember what he had told me. Whatever, shopping time. He‚Äôs getting snippy in the store, I‚Äôm getting pissed about his attitude. We get home and he asks what‚Äôs wrong, I explain everything I can, how I didn‚Äôt like how snippy he got and how he was dragging me through crowds of people and I didn‚Äôt like that. He apologized and said he figured it was an in and out trip and he was just trying to be fast. Whatever, he makes food and I sit down to cool off. A few minutes later I hear him groaning and go into the bedroom to find him on the floor, nauseous and feeling sick‚Ä¶..he didn‚Äôt eat before he took all those stupid gummies. Que 2 hours of groaning, burping, throwing up, and shitting 6 times. Then he goes back into the bedroom to try and fall asleep, which he did for 3 hours. All of which I had to be present for because I was anxious he could suffocate on his puke. I get 2 days off a week, he signed us up for plans with his friend Saturday which took away that day, I was looking forward to doing what I wanted to today and he knew that. 
I don‚Äôt want an irresponsible boyfriend who I have to take care of 24/7. I already don‚Äôt want kids because I had to raise my siblings and he knows that. 
Maybe I‚Äôm just burnt out from my job, maybe I‚Äôm just being too emotional about it, maybe I‚Äôm just jealous that he gets to work from home while I‚Äôm in a stinky hot kitchen for 8+ hours a day and still have to come home and clean and make dinner. 
He‚Äôs helped me through so much and been there for me as much as he could be. And we love each other and have 2 cats and a tiny apartment together. I don‚Äôt just want to break up with him but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to bring up the open relationship again incase that makes him depressed again. I know he‚Äôs been suicidal before and has cut and tried to end himself‚Ä¶.idk I‚Äôm just really confused and sad right now. 
What should I do? I‚Äôm sure a big conversation is in my future, but from past trauma I suck at conversations and tend to start crying immediately no matter what I‚Äôm talking about. Please let me know what you think‚Ä¶.am I the problem? ",1,1740957654.0,relationshipadvice,2,1.0,False

And there are many more...

So, look at all these incidents. Have ever wondered where and why the local gathered to attack the Punjabi's? Have you ever seen mod attacking a particular party when two parties are involved in the dispute? Here are few clues why and how it happened.

* These are same Hindutva mob attacks that are happening all over the country.
* Sikhs/Punjabi's are particularly targeted for their protest against Farm Laws. The venom Kangana was spewing is not just limited to her - many people follow her and agree with her. Same people made here MP. Those are the views of most of the Hindutva crowd.
* This Hindutva vigilante groups communicates through WhatsApp and target the their victims as a mob. Check this article to to see how they follow their victims and coordinate their attacks. They are operating everywhere and has full support of the local police. Yes, they operate in Punjab and Chandigarh too - only that they don't have full support of police there.
   * [In Mangaluru, Hindutva groups wield a web of informers to target interfaith friends](https://www.thenewsminute.com/karnataka/mangaluru-hindutva-groups-wield-web-informers-target-interfaith-friends-151860) \- According to the investigating police, the men who accosted them included a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member and activists of the Bajrang Dal, a pro-Hindutva organisation. Three men identified as Vinayachandra, a BJP member, Ajith and Bharat, affiliated to Bajrang Dal, then picked out the lone Muslim man and hit him on the head. They abused the students, particularly shaming the women for traveling with a Muslim man.
   * ‚ÄúIn other cases, we have seen shopkeepers, bus conductors and auto drivers inform groups like the Bajrang Dal or Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) about the movement of interfaith groups or couples. The fact that couples or groups are hanging out is enough to raise the suspicion of people, including bystanders,‚Äù a senior police official in Mangaluru says.
* Instigating/gaslight/provocate their target - In all of the above cases you will see that they were intentionally targeted by mob for minor (made up) parking issues. This is their same modus operandi like everywhere else - like how they go outside the mosques and try to provoke Muslims by playing loud songs etc.
* In all the cases police joined the mob and tried to erase the phone footage. Moreover, FRI's were only registered after media and social media outrage.
* Diljit Dosanjh was targeted in similar fashion by RSS/Hindutva crowd for his support for protests against farm laws.  The Right-wing outfit only had to dip into its moral panic playbook. First, there were the protests over alcohol sales at the concert. These were followed quickly by dire warnings about ‚Äúrampant drug consumption‚Äù and finally, the absence of segregated seating leading to ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äù, the VHP‚Äôs favourite project. But it was **VHP leader Avinash Kaushal who said the quiet part aloud:** ‚Äú**Through the media we learned that Diljit Dosanjh was involved in funding the farmers‚Äô movement and \[was\] a supporter of Khalistan.‚Äù -** [Diljit Dosanjh disrupts Hindu Right imagination‚Äîa masterclass in GOAT patriotism](https://theprint.in/opinion/diljit-dosanjh-disrupts-hindu-right-imagination-goat-patriotism/2425328/)

Hi, 
I have been having extremely debilitating fatigue for about 2 weeks now, and am now 6 days late for my period. I have been taking my thyroid medicine as directed and had recent labs that were fine. I took a pregnancy test and it was negative. I have two kids but my husband has been handling the waking up at night for me so I can rest. I've been eating around 1600 cal and 90ish grams of protein, and eating sufficient carbs.

Only other random symptoms I don't think are related are: -I've had a sore throat off and on for months from post nasal drip. -I've had random severe sharp pains under both ribs. It only lasts a few seconds and then it's done. -long history of biannual noncardiac chest pain. -past 3 days experienced almost fainting when I wake up in the morning after I stand up, and several episodes similar a day. 

What the fatigue looks like: 

Today I woke up after sleeping from 10-6, had my coffee and 30g protein for breakfast, struggled to get off the couch and get the day going (heavy limbs, brain fog, feeling incredibly sleepy). Throughout the day I'm exhausted. Around 2 I feel like i could fall asleep standing up. Got through dinner and its now 6pm and I'm laying down in bed trying to muster up the energy to go do bedtime with the kids. I've been also having waves of weakness, like being unable to carry or lift small but heavy things I normally can, like my kids. 

What do i do here? Is this normal? Should I see my pcp?

I have a situation and questions about an INF-J female and here it might reach the right people about this.

To me: I am 44 and diagnosed with Autism, so some of the struggle is because of this for sure. She: Is also 44, birthdays only a few days apart and she told me, that she is an INF-J.

Back then, she gave me her number and after 1,5 years from time to time texting, she said: ""You are for sure a cool dude, let us go out for a coffee some time soon."" 2 Days later we were there and it was great. We harmonized, acted like childs, she talked about decorating my appartement, bumped often into me because I teased her and she teased back and she was also very worried and couldn¬¥t sleep until she knew, that I was safely at home. 1-2 hours is her maximum time to be around with friends and family, but with me, she spent 7 hours strolling around and she also paid for lunch and dinner. We were sure to see us again and also wrote eachother the next 1-2 days and now its the 2nd side of this medal--

\-- sometimes she don¬¥t answer or even read my messages for 1-2 weeks. She is aware of her poor texting behavior and apologizes for it, she also feels very bad about this and said to me: ""Thank you for not beeing mad or angry with me because of this.""

First I thought she doesn¬¥t liked me nor she wants to see me again and was only polite, but when she answers to my messages, it is always an Intro of why she is late and then her answer takes every of my messages into account and often ends in a wall of text. It doesn¬¥t matter if I wrote 2 or 8 messages in this 2 weeks, she never was angry or mad about this. Last time I asked for her full name, because she knows mine and she told a funny story related to it and then gave me her full name.

As i wrote, I am a guy with Autism and often I don¬¥t get the signs or interpret them wrong, but I changed the ""She might not like me"" to a ""maybe she likes me more than she wants to admit"", even if its 2 months ago since we went for a coffee. As far as I know, INF-J¬¥s can be highly sensitive and she might try to be in her safe spot as long as possible is what I think atm.

My questions now are, do I interpret her behavior wrong? How do you INF-J¬¥s act or behave with people you like or dislike and what do you think about her behavior?

It's so insanely scary and has caused me extreme anxiety (already had health / heart anxiety but it's now 10000% worse)  
  
Because of this pain I have been to urgent care, the ER and to my PCP in the past two months. Had multiple EKG's, multiple labs / bloodwork, chest x ray. They claim it's not my heart. Gastro said esophagus is near the heart and pain is easily confused. FYI I'm only 37 and otherwise healthy.   
  
I did a few weeks of pepcid because I really didn't want to go on a PPI again (had GERD years ago and had a bad experience with Nexium) But a few days ago my PCP convinced me to go on Pantoprazole because she thinks my esophagus is inflamed. I'm on day 2 and it's helped my appetite but not the chest/stomach/back pain. Has anyone else experienced this? Does it ever go away? I'm so anxious waiting for the endoscopy and i'm not sure if I need to see a cardiologist (PCP says no - not heart) but I just can't get it out of my mind! I feel like i'm going crazy.

Also I always hear my name told right to my ear when I'm alone. In addition there's been times in which I've felt like a tap on my shoulder while, again, being all alone.

That's not the only weird shit that's happened to me here's a quick list:
- things get lost at my home (any home I've lived in)
- I've seen weird lights in the night sky moving in ways I can't figure our how (I live in a little town with little public lights and pitch black nights)
- a relative died when I was very little (4 or 5 years old) and during the funeral I talked with a man who looked on his 50s who looked very... not like most people on my town (again it's not a very diverse place and he looked like he was from another country). Also, I don't remember what we talked about and I just know this happened bc one of my siblings told me about it, this is relevant bc I've been seeing him at the corner of my eyes every now and then when I go out just to realize nobody is there once I turn to check
- Some friends have told me they've seen weirdly shaped shadows while staying at my home.
- Once on of those friends kept a short one-sided conversation with one of those shadows bc he said it looked like I was in the room and said the shadow ran away when he got closes and realized it wasn't me.

And finally, a friend of my recently got a  pendulum and is trying to learn how  to use it for future readings, I offered to be read so she could practice and nothing pretty remarkable was said in that session just very average stuff and confirmation questions about things we lived on high-school.

But what made me do this post is a dream I had some days afters: 

I dreamed I was at home making my children lunch and sending them to school, then someone knocked at my door; it was a tall good looking man on a luxury suit who entered like if it was his house, helped himself to coffee and sat down, signaled me to do the same and then told me pretty clearly that I should not read my future ever again. After that he left and I was scared enough to call my partner, tell him to pick up the children and since we've have to move away quickly since our lives were in danger. Then I woke up.

Sidenote: I'm not married and have no children.

So, I don't think I'm cursed nor anything but I wanted to ask if this is a common experience and just like my mind playing tricks or if I should be, I don't know, going to some church or a medium or something. Thanks for taking the time to read all this.",2,1740956463.0,Paranormal,1,1.0,False

Broke up with boyfriend over insanely transphobic & racial jokes.,"I (28F) broke up with my (now ex) boyfriend (29M). We'd been together for about 6 months - first few months was great. He was a provider, protector - all the nice things. Then occasionally start to make racist and/or homophobic jokes. Would tell him to stop, he'd apologize, stop for a couple weeks then go right back at it. Sat him down about a month ago w a serious conversation and explained how hurtful and unnecessary those comments are. I have a very diverse friend group, while I'm not part of the LGBTQ+ community, they're great people and humans like the rest of us.

Cut to this weekend. His family went to take a weekend trip and I couldn't make it because I've been working all weekend. Was giving him a very general ""I'm really busy, I'm working on a big project but I'm under NDA so I can't disclose"". He got really ""hurt"" by that and insisted I tell him. I didn't, I'm not jeopardizing my job/project for someone who I know has a loose mouth. Context: I work in media and he's a first responder. He told me he breaks HIPAA laws to tell me about his day (don't ever ask, he just tells me). I'm not too sure if he respects my boundaries either.

Had a late Friday getting things done, slept in on Saturday. I woke up to a handful of calls and he was asking if I was ignoring him. The first few text messages I read that morning was a story about how he WALKED out of a Starbucks because there was a ""tranny"" and ex ""didn't want them to touch their drink"". 

Super stern I told him 1) was sleeping in late because of working late/burnout 2) still peeved about the NDA conversation 3) there's absolutely no reason he should be saying comments like that. they're human just like us and they are simply making your order. 

His response? ""I like to make fun of them"" - that was my last straw. I couldn't put up with it and just said ""I have no words, take care. I have to block your number. You're ignorant and immature and I have no energy left trying to work with you"". 

I don't understand actively making fun of people who are different or have different views than you. Nonetheless walking out of a coffee shop because someone might be transgender and you don't them touching your drink? That's asinine.

Days are finally getting better and she is in a cycle of being very anxious about how to spend her days, the uncertainty of not knowing what to do after she wakes up is overwhelming and having to decide what to do by herself for a whole day is almost paralyzing in the mornings. She becomes really chill and great in the evenings because the day is almost over and she doesn't need to decide what to do with the time at all, she knows that she can just relax and go to bed. Obviously telling her to just relax in the morning is the opposite of helpful, and I had a thought that she seems to do much better when we have a morning appointment to go to (seeing the psychiatrist, needing to return to the psych ward, a morning walk with friends). She is someone who worked overtime her whole life and now doesn't know how to make sense of life without a purpose (i.e. a job) or routine. We are really struggling with developing new interests and setting goals for this free retirement time. But she is very open minded! She is fighting hard and has energy in small bursts to try something new.

Could you suggest some hobbies that we can go try? Here are somethings about her that might help:

* \- She basically has intense ADHD and cannot read a book or watch movies
* \- She was professionally trained at technical drawing and is artistic but colouring and painting are not bringing joy atm
* \- She likes to golf and is a good coach but it can't just be the driving range 24/7, we need something new
* \- She seems to have anxiety about 'having' to make meals, planning what to cook is very overwhelming and has never been something she liked doing her whole life
* \- She is a knick knacks person, I thought maybe volunteering at a thrift store would be great for someone like her
* \- She has trouble with games, I tried to show her animal crossing as that seems to be great for a lot of people's Moms but she hasn't warmed to the  idea of gaming
* \- She was a part of many cycling groups that go for long distance rides and are very social with coffee breaks, which is making winter extremely hard

1j240d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1j240d5/how_can_i_mom_best_show_up_for_my_husband_as_a/,How Can I (Mom) Best Show Up for My Husband as a Stay-at-Home Dad?,"Posting this here because while SAHDs aren‚Äôt unheard of, I know the SAHM perspective is far more common, and I‚Äôd love some insight.

Quick backstory: Parenthood started out with both of us self-employed and working from home. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but we could split the load and tap out when needed. Then, about a month ago, things changed.

I do freelance writing in a niche space and got a huge influx of orders, which led to a huge opportunity‚Äîaka, a ""real job"" as my boomer relatives would say üôÑ (If my freelance work wasn‚Äôt a real job, I‚Äôd like all that tax money back, please.)

I've never been a huge career person, but if I ever had a dream job, this would be it. It pays extremely well, and I genuinely love it.

My husband, also self-employed, works in a niche industry that‚Äôs been abysmal lately, causing stress levels that I worried might actually give him a heart attack. Since my new job more than covers us financially, I encouraged him to take a step back‚Äîand now he‚Äôs a full-time SAHD to our 6.5-month-old daughter.

He‚Äôs absolutely rocking it. He is so patient, loving, and deeply engaged. The bond they share melts my heart.

But damn, this shit is hard.

She‚Äôs in the 6-month-old separation anxiety era where if he dares to leave the room‚Äîeven just to refill her bottle‚Äîshe acts like he‚Äôs enlisted in the military and will never return.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: He has severe chronic pain. Four failed shoulder surgeries from high school wrestling. Trigeminal neuralgia (aka the ""suicide disease,"" considered one of the most painful conditions known to man). Many days, just existing hurts.

We are on our own in the state we live in. No family. Both of us didn't grow up in the best environment so moving back near family isn't really an option wr want to explore. 

His problem is that he is selfless to a fault. On my days off/after work, I have to beg him to take a walk outside, a hot bath‚Äîsomething to decompress. Twice now, he‚Äôs called me crying on the verge of a panic attack, and I had to remind him of what he always tells me:

""Put on your oxygen mask first. She will live if she has to cry for 10 minutes while you breathe in the backyard.""

I want him to feel seen. This is such an unseen job, and I know how deeply he gives himself to it. Saying, ""I love and appreciate you"" feels so... hollow in comparison to how much I actually feel it.

Somethings I currently do: 

- Handling as much housework as possible. His physical energy should go toward her, not dishes.

- Making mornings easier. He‚Äôs in the worst pain when he wakes up, so I leave his meds/supplements with water on his nightstand, coffee ready, and if time allows, a simple breakfast.

- Prepping baby stuff. She‚Äôs cleaned, dressed, and fed before I leave. Her formula pitcher for the day is ready.

- Honoring his love language. For both of us, that's physical touch (and yes, I do mean that kind of touch lmao). I asked if he experiences that ""touched out"" feeling I hear about in mom groups, and he said he gets it‚Äîbut at the end of the day, after being smacked, kicked, and holding her all day, the thing he wants most is that sacred intimate touch. Since I have the drive of a 16-year-old boy, we are more than set in this department. üòÇ


Where we differ slightly is our secondary love languages. Mine is words of affirmation, his is acts of service.

For the longest time, I couldn‚Äôt understand why my lack of follow-through on little things upset him so much. Like if he forgot to do the dishes, I‚Äôd just think, ‚ÄúEh, whatever, he had a long day.‚Äù But if I said I‚Äôd do something and didn‚Äôt? He‚Äôd feel hurt.

On the flip side, I couldn‚Äôt figure out why my long, emotional love texts didn‚Äôt seem to fully hit for him. He likes them, but he feels love when I do something for him.

So, I‚Äôve been really intentional about follow-through. Because, as I remind myself, it‚Äôs not ""just dishes"" when your shoulders have dislocated 100+ times.

He's also been intentional about honoring my love language‚ÄîI wake up to the sweetest text almost every morning.

Here‚Äôs where I need advice - I could ask him exactly what would make the day-to-day easier, but I hear a lot about the ‚Äúmental load‚Äù in mom spaces‚Äîwhere having to tell your spouse what needs to be done is another stressor.

I don‚Äôt want to ask in a way that makes him feel like I‚Äôm putting the burden of directing me on him. Instead, I want to just do.

So, SAHMs (and SAHPs in general), what makes you feel most supported by your spouse? What small or big things make a difference in your daily experience?

And if any of you also deal with chronic pain, what support from your spouse has helped the most?

I know this is a bit of a reversed situation, but I figure if anyone knows what it‚Äôs like, it‚Äôs you all.

TL;DR‚ÄîMy husband is a SAHD, a great one, and I want to make sure he feels how much I love and appreciate him beyond just words. How do I best show up for him?

1j240am,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1j240am/am_i_21m_at_fault_for_choosing_to_meet_with/,am i [21M] at fault for choosing to meet with business partner over my gf [21F]?,"THIS POST IS LENGTHY BECAUSE OF COPY/PASTED TEXT. if you would like to read the texts without the context, i marked the start of them.

some more context can be found in my last post on the relationship advice sub. TLDR on that post: my gf and i have not been in talking for the past 2 weeks after a big fight. i keep her updated and she does not because she blocks me on every form of communication. 

now my gf and i are back to talking a little bit throughout the day. a couple of days ago she asked me if we could talk but only if i truly reflected on what i want from this relationship and if i can prevent myself from getting frustrated or ruining the talking mood. i was honest with her and told her that i am not ready to talk but i still went over to her to reassure her that i still want to be with her. after that night, we have been texting very little throughout the day. i keep her updated and she keeps me updated a little bit. 

a little context about my business partner and i: i met him through my gf as he is the bf to my gf‚Äôs close friend. we get along well and we decided to start a business because during a trip a month ago, we got really into an idea and concept and we both want to flesh it out. we have been talking about starting it for almost a month now, and have slowly been working on starting up the company. we have both been itching to get started but our schedules are really busy so we havent found time to sit down again and have a meeting to truly get the ball rolling. my gf knows about this business as i have been telling her about it through the emails i send to her. today my business partner and i finally found time to meet today at 3:30 PM.

my gf was supposed to get coffee with a friend at 5:30 PM. we told eachother our plans yesterday. i had work from 8a-2:30p and then went home to freshen up and change. my business partner texts me and asks me if we could move the meeting time to 4:30. for more context, the plan was to meet in person at a cafe. i tell him that its okay and since i had an hour or so before meeting, i decided to get a quick workout in at the gym. when i get to the gym, my gf texts me and tells me that her plans were cancelled and that they might catch up over facetime or something. that was the last thing i heard from her regarding her hangout. i keep my gf updated about the gym and when i left to meet up with my business partner. we met up at 4:30 and i told my gf and she sends me ‚Äúblocked.‚Äù 

i take it with a grain of salt and continue to cook up my business with him. we ended up working and talking until 8 PM and then we decide that we are both hungry, so we decided to get tacos. during this time i only told my gf when i arrived to the meeting and when i left to get food. i didnt tell her anything after leaving to get food as i didnt think it was too necesary. i get food with my business partner snd we end up talking a bit more until 9:30. we both go our separate ways and i EMAIL (we havent been texting this whole time just through email) her that i am done and am going to head home because my head was starting to hurt (i get really bad migraines from time to time and headaches are no better) and that i was physically and mentally exhausted from the day and havent had time to rest.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîim going to send the email convo

- ME: 

‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùdone with [FOOD]. we talked a lot about business and ideas and visions that we have for the company. i want to tell you all about it. its so cold. we sat outside and ate because it was busy inside and i dont have a jacket. i think it made my headache worse too. im so tired and my head is hurting even more now probably because of the cold. im gonna go home and rest. did you actually block me on here?‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù


- HER:

‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùfuck you cunt

go fucking die in the cold. never living up to your word as always. yes you were blocked you fucking retard. imagine my disappointment when i check my blocked and NOTHING FROM YOU. i got too attached again. please go kill yourself. 

HAD A WHOLLEEE DAY FREE OFC YOU STILL DIDNT WANNA SEE ME. OF FUCKING COURSE. OFFFF FUCKING COURSE. DONT WANNA SEE ME DONT WNANA DRIVE ME DONT WANNA DO ANYTHING W ME ANYMORE HUH SINCE YOUR FUCKASS HAS NO DRIVE NOW. 

see. i blocked you bc i knew you wouldn‚Äôt keep me updated. of fucking course you act the way i expect you to. of fucking course you lie to my face again. again and again and again. wtv you already told me you‚Äôre used to not updating me and since you‚Äôre SOOOO USED TO NOT HEARING FROM ME YOURE NOT RVEN CURIOUS ANYMORE. YOU DONT EVEN FUCKING WORRY ABOJT ME ANYMORE. YOU DONT EVEN CARE I DROVE TO [45 MINS DISTANCE] BY MYSELF. FUCK YOU. I TELL U MY COFFEE CHAT GOT CANCELED AND YOU DONT EVEN CARE. YOU DIDNT RVEN TAKR CARE OF ME 

you keep fucking do this to me. to us. idk why. just lmk if you ever wanna talk.‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù

- ME:

‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùi do want to see you but i feel so terrible physically and i dont feel like id be able to give you my full attention with my headache right now. i did update you when i was gonna go to [FOOD] but im sorry for not telling you that i got there because [BP] got there before me and he called me asking where i was and i was focused on getting there and inside that i didnt stop to text you. im home right now and am gonna rest my head. i do want to see you but i feel physically terrible right now and im not making excuses i just dont want to give you part of my attention.‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù

- HER:

‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùmore focused on him than me alright. that porn watcher over me ALRIGHT HAHAHAHA fuck you. yeah stay home faggot keep making excuses

you only wanna see me at the end of the day?? cool so you don‚Äôt even wanna be seen w me. you didn‚Äôt update me at [MEETING]. you didn‚Äôt update me at [FOOD]. you didn‚Äôt give me shit. not even what yg are doing every minute and what you ate. oh so you don‚Äôt wanna fucking share that shit w me alright OKAAAYYY HAHAHA fuck you. ykw since you hate me so much, ill just accept my date invitation. 

don‚Äôt fucking bother responding. oh poor mr migraine that stops him from even sending one teeny tiny text that COMMUNICATES what the HELL is going on

oh sure sit in the cold and stay out late. you did this to yourself. as fucking always. you‚Äôre fucking horrible to yourself and everyone around you. 

honestly just do not contact me unless you are ready to talk. again, once you are ready to SERIOUSLY talk and give me full, thoughtful answers throughout the entire conversation. without a hint of attitude or bad energy. I deserve your full attention since you never ever gave me that during a talk. the boundaries are confusing right now. idk if it hurts more being disappointed while knowing you lost drive and you basically don't have any obligation towards me, especially since you let go of those obligations so often, or being disappointed when we're knowingly tgt and you do have an obligation to me. due to us being in contact for the past 2 ish days, it confused the boundaries again for me. leading me to leave time in my day to see you and expect the same from you. leading me to immediately thinking of seeing you the moment my plans got canceled. leaving to me being ready to plan around my plans to be able to see you. leading me to expect you to update me. yet you didnt update me and didnt even try seeing me after work or before your meeting or even after. i'm too confused rn lmfao. if i dont hear from you a month from now, we're officially over. [MUTUAL] and i both agreed that you already had this past month to get your shit tgt and decide what you want. i gave you space for the past month and you are still not ready to talk lol. I actually have a free day next week, if things work out, maybe you'll be ready to talk by that day. if not, see you in less than a month or never again. I dont need this back and forth. at least thats what it feels like, you never even gave me an answer last night nor today about whether or not you wanted to be in contact before we talk. you do not respect me. you never have and it seems like you never will. you will receive the same treatment.

this is the same as a year ago with your film shit. you do your film shit and you do your stupid business with [BP] and suddenly, i'm not a part of your life anymore?? i do not exist anymore? does not matter what you say. you treat me as if i do not exist whenever you get caught up in your individual life or whenever smtg ""inconvenient"" happens like smtg not going the way you want to. you only get back to me when you want to be babied or when you're not busy anymore. you dont want to create a balance in your life to include me in it? fine. but thats your fucking downfall. you're setting yourself up to die alone. or maybe it is just me youre doing this to. you go out with a psychological cheater even tho you dont feel well rather than spend that time with me. alright. I understand it now. it is just me. you think your time is better spent with a douche bag rather than someone who gave everything to you. nice.‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù


uhh yeah. kind of a lot. am i at fault for not visiting her today? what do you guys think about this situation? do i respond? what is the best course of action here? if you actually read through this i appreciate you. i will answer anything needed for context.",3,1740956186.0,amiwrong,4,0.8,False

My boyfriend has made a few comments that have stuck with me, and I‚Äôm not sure how to interpret them or what to do next.

The most recent example. We were at a coffee shop, and I mispronounced the name of a coffee bean. Later, he told me he was embarrassed because other people might think I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing.

Another time, I got really excited about a new coffee bean at a different shop, and he acted like I was being ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù These moments made me feel like I have to tone myself down to avoid embarrassing him.

I told him that I want to be with someone who doesn‚Äôt see small things like that as a problem and that he should be with someone he doesn‚Äôt feel embarrassed by. Sometimes I struggle with English, and I don‚Äôt want to feel bad about it in my own relationship.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to approach this. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?",1,1740956181.0,relationship_advice,17,0.67,False

So first, I'm not sure if I understand all the time travel stuff or if what they're trying to say about time travel makes a lot of sense but that doesn't matter. I love the story

1. We finally get the pay off on why M√∂bius loves jet skis so much.

2. Can we talk about the camera work in this show. Every shot in that opening sequence in the TVA was immaculate and through this whole season actually.

3. They made use of the time slipping again even after we thought it was resolved and actually it's now the only thing that can save the universe. I like that. Though I still don't understand why he can do that. Also I like that they acknowledge that it wasn't random. He was subconsciously going where he wanted to be. I feel like in other shows theyd just say, yeah he teleported right where he needed to be randomly, just so the story can happen. 

4. I, like everyone, love moments in media when the hero realises their potential. So when he figured out time slipping, I was very excited.

5. Loki is forced to face the fact that he was doing all of that work because he wanted to stay with his friends. It wasnt just about Kang even if those things aligned. Satisfying.

6. It's a shame that Sylvie's philosophy ended up being wrong but until time broke, they both had good arguments for doing what they were doing. And one of them had to be wrong at the end of the day. So it had to be her.

7. OB having the ability to build a Tempad was convenient but I'm not mad at it.

8. And having my boy Casey in Alcatraz. That was rough but it was good to show not everyone has a perfect life on the timeline and it showed how different one person can be when they're forced to exist in a shitty situation.

9. I liked how, after talking to Sylvie in the bar, when his glass of bourbon disappeared I thought, oh no someone on set messed up like the GoT coffee cup but not as bad. Then I saw Loki also noticed it vanished. So I mentally apologised for thinking this team messed up like that. 

I'm sure there are other things I haven't touched on or noticed but I wanted to share my appreciation. On to the finale!",5,1740956146.0,LokiTV,1,0.86,False
