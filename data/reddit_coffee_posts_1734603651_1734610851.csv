What's the weather like in those months? Can you recommend a nice place to rent for 2-3 months? Do you have any suggestions for nice communities for socialising or drinking coffee with someone? Or doing any creative or musical activities? I speak Brazilian Portuguese fairly well, but would love to know if it's possible to practice Portuguese with someone while staying in Madeira?

Also - do any of you know where the employment office is located?",1,1734610777.0,Madeira,0,1.0,False

Scar is surgical, courtesy of Patrick AFB hospital (they did a good job).  Did the C&P, examiner measured the scar (18.5cm x 4cm).  VA deferred asking for medical opinion.  

SOOOOOOOO…..I went to my private primary care doc yesterday and asked her to take a photo 😂.   It’s a beautiful photo.  A full color, hi def, picture of my hairy bobbing man ass (with the twins peaking out a little) with a glorious scar running from the ole bunghole north said 18.5cm.   Edited photo to make sure said ass looks amazing and then uploaded the photo to my claim.   

I’m thinking of having the photo enlarged and framed and then sending it to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs as a Christmas Gift.

I am tempted to post the picture, but I don’t want you all spitting out your morning coffee.

Basically I have many health issues including type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes and also, I went through a heart attack about 2 years ago.

I am focusing on lowering my cholesterol and balancing my sugar and I have all the medication to help me do that, as well, right now I'm focusing on changing the way I'm eating to assist doing this. My sugar seems to be under control for a while now, so that's not the issue.

Two months ago I started really changing how I eat.

I also suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome and that really affects the levels of my energy Since I've started changing to the way I eat I've noticed that I have a little bit more energy and I feel better. Also, I'm allergic to taking statins and I just started a new drug about 2 weeks ago, but in the past 3 months I've lowered my cholesterol by 50 points - simply by the way I eat.

I'm focusing on protein, eating 100 to 140 g of protein a day, And also trying to make sure I eat at least 30 grams of fiber a day focusing mainly on soluble fiber as much as I can. It should be about a third of your daily fiber and should be about 10 g a day.

I'm also not a meat eater., I do eat dairy but I'm finding  it easier to find protein solutions in vegan recipes. Chickpeas rule!!!!

Although I've been tracking what I've been eating on a simple Excel chart for almost 2 months now, I've started tracking what I eat on my fitness pal since 12.1.2024 and I've started looking at the breakdown of the food and the calorie source and it seems like I'm eating quite a bit of fat.  It's over 30% of the calorie source but I don't think there's anything I can change about my diet drastically,

I'm following several simple guidelines:

1. I make sure to eat 100 to 140 g of protein a day
2. to eat at least 30 grams of fiber aiming for 10 g of soluble fiber - mainly coming from food and not a supplements
3. I try to eat under 2,000 calories a day,
4. I refuse to stay hungry!

I've done that and I no longer am willing to put myself through that. Years of eating disorders are over for me !

5. I also know that I really have to avoid cheddar cheese. I LOVE cheddar cheese! cheddar cheese is probably not very good for my cholesterol. So that's the only thing that I avoid eating, although I did eat my first 100 g the other day, after an emotional day. but that's the first time I've eaten it in 3 months so I guess that's okay.

I cook. I love cooking. I meal prep.

I'm learning a lot about what food has in it I'm making my own recipes and adapting them to have more protein and more fiber. I do use protein powders and I make my own coffee with a little bit of protein powder also using oat milk instead of cow's milk means, that you get a little fiber with your coffee as well.

I'm not a big fruit eater but I make sure to eat an apple a day. With 4.5 to 5.5 g of fiber in one of these babies.

I'm just wondering if I'm eating too much fat.

I will point out that I have not weighed myself  for a while. I don't like going on the scale. I'll probably make myself do that next week just to have a number down, but I'm definitely overweight and feeling it in my body. I've always been overweight but not morbidly obese. I think I weigh somewhere between 100 to 110 kilos right now. I am tall at 5.9 ft.

My diet is filled with vegetables  and vegetarian protein sources.

Did I mention yet the chickpeas are SuperFood?

I also love lentils and as I said I don't have a problem with cooking and meal prepping, but I also don't want to be obsessed about this. I just want to feel better, lose weight and if the fat source calories are not a real problem then honestly? I don't see a point in time where I'm going to go ""when I'm done losing weight"", or ""when I'm done with this diet"" cuz I'm going to be eating like this for the rest of my life.

I'm enjoying eating, I'm enjoying cooking. I'm not hungry. I have energy and my sugar seems to be doing well.

I hope my cholesterol is going in the right direction and I have energy and that's the main thing.

(My fitness is in very bad shape. The worse it's ever been. Going back to track steps since that's always seem to be a good way for me to go. I've been tracking steps since 12.1.2024. My goal for this entire month is to walk 3,000 steps every day. and try to walk a little more each week on my weekly average. I will also be starting to work out in a program for making sure I'm ok with my heart. Just have to finish doing some tests first. So i'm ok and will get better).",1,1734610572.0,diet,1,1.0,False

1hhrlth,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1hhrlth/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

1hhrlhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1hhrlhb/mother_believes_that_im_unstable/,Mother believes that I’m unstable,"  I’m home for the holidays and I’ve been experiencing a hypomanic episode for quite a while now. Essentially, I haven’t slept more than 15 hours in three days. My mother found out I spoke to my psychiatrist and was prescribed seroquil. She immediately freaked out (because of past traumas that happened to involve the medication) and demanded that she speak to my psychiatrist (I am an adult) about prescribing me Xanax instead. 

Now she’s been blaming my episode on my behavior, namely caffeine. Both my therapist and psychiatrist have told me that with the amount of caffeine I’ve had, it should not be contributing to the mania. She’s continuously checking up on me when I’m out, searching my car for energy drinks/ coffee. She’s also asking my sister to check up on me. I’m staying with my family for the next few weeks, and since I’m in their house I feel like I’m being punished. 

She thinks that I’m letting myself go and I don’t care enough to work on my mania. But, she also freaks out if I discuss taking the medication that has been prescribed to me. She is so concerned that I’m going to do something drastic that she wants to monitor me and speak to my doctors. She watches how often I exercise and what I eat, and looks at receipts to see what I’ve been spending. She wants me to let her track me, again, I am an adult and I live six hours from her. I have never had any dangerous ideations. All she knows about my current state is that I’ve been struggling with sleep. No matter how much I tell her I’m okay (either truth or lies to keep some sort of privacy) she refuses to believe a word I say. 

My train home is scheduled for January 4th and I’m not sure how long I can handle this.

I also suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome and that really affects the levels of my energy Since I've started changing to the way I eat I've noticed that I have a little bit more energy and I feel better. Also, I'm allergic to taking statins and I just started a new drug about 2 weeks ago, but in the past 3 months I've lowered my cholesterol by 50 points - simply by the way I eat.

I'm focusing on protein, eating 100 to 140 g of protein a day, And also trying to make sure I eat at least 30 grams of fiber a day focusing mainly on soluble fiber as much as I can. It should be about a third of your daily fiber and should be about 10 g a day.

I'm also not a meat eater., I do eat dairy but I'm finding  it easier to find protein solutions in vegan recipes. Chickpeas rule!!!!

Although I've been tracking what I've been eating on a simple Excel chart for almost 2 months now, I've started tracking what I eat on my fitness pal since 12.1.2024 and I've started looking at the breakdown of the food and the calorie source and it seems like I'm eating quite a bit of fat.  It's over 30% of the calorie source but I don't think there's anything I can change about my diet drastically,

I'm following several simple guidelines:

1. I make sure to eat 100 to 140 g of protein a day
2. to eat at least 30 grams of fiber aiming for 10 g of soluble fiber - mainly coming from food and not a supplements
3. I try to eat under 2,000 calories a day,
4. I refuse to stay hungry!

I've done that and I no longer am willing to put myself through that. Years of eating disorders are over for me !

5. I also know that I really have to avoid cheddar cheese. I LOVE cheddar cheese! cheddar cheese is probably not very good for my cholesterol. So that's the only thing that I avoid eating, although I did eat my first 100 g the other day, after an emotional day. but that's the first time I've eaten it in 3 months so I guess that's okay.

I cook. I love cooking. I meal prep.

I'm learning a lot about what food has in it I'm making my own recipes and adapting them to have more protein and more fiber. I do use protein powders and I make my own coffee with a little bit of protein powder also using oat milk instead of cow's milk means, that you get a little fiber with your coffee as well.

I'm not a big fruit eater but I make sure to eat an apple a day. With 4.5 to 5.5 g of fiber in one of these babies.

I'm just wondering if I'm eating too much fat.

I will point out that I have not weighed myself  for a while. I don't like going on the scale. I'll probably make myself do that next week just to have a number down, but I'm definitely overweight and feeling it in my body. I've always been overweight but not morbidly obese. I think I weigh somewhere between 100 to 110 kilos right now. I am tall at 5.9 ft.

My diet is filled with vegetables  and vegetarian protein sources.

Did I mention yet the chickpeas are SuperFood?

I also love lentils and as I said I don't have a problem with cooking and meal prepping, but I also don't want to be obsessed about this. I just want to feel better, lose weight and if the fat source calories are not a real problem then honestly? I don't see a point in time where I'm going to go ""when I'm done losing weight"", or ""when I'm done with this diet"" cuz I'm going to be eating like this for the rest of my life.

I'm enjoying eating, I'm enjoying cooking. I'm not hungry. I have energy and my sugar seems to be doing well.

I hope my cholesterol is going in the right direction and I have energy and that's the main thing.

(My fitness is in very bad shape. The worse it's ever been. Going back to track steps since that's always seem to be a good way for me to go. I've been tracking steps since 12.1.2024. My goal for this entire month is to walk 3,000 steps every day. and try to walk a little more each week on my weekly average. I will also be starting to work out in a program for making sure I'm ok with my heart. Just have to finish doing some tests first. So i'm ok and will get better).",1,1734610332.0,Protein,0,1.0,False

Comparing Power Swabs with Other Teeth Whitening Products: Pros and Cons
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a brighter smile, many people look for effective teeth whitening solutions. Power Swabs have gained attention as a quick and easy way to enhance your pearly whites. But how does this product stack up against other teeth whitening methods available on the market? Let’s explore the pros and cons of Power Swabs compared to traditional whitening options like strips, gels, and professional treatments.

### Understanding Power Swabs

Power Swabs are a unique teeth whitening system that uses a patented swab applicator. The product claims to lift stains and whiten teeth without the sensitivity commonly associated with other methods. The application process is simple: you use a swab to apply the formula directly onto your teeth for a few minutes. This convenience appeals to many users who are always on-the-go.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Pros of Power Swabs

- **Ease of Use:** The swabs are compact and portable, making them easy to carry. You can use them virtually anywhere, ideal for travel or quick touch-ups.
- **Quick Results:** Many users notice a difference after just one use. Power Swabs often promise an instant improvement in the whiteness of teeth.
- **Less Sensitivity:** Users frequently report experiencing less tooth sensitivity compared to gels and strips.
- **Effective on Stains:** Power Swabs are designed to target stains from coffee, wine, soda, and smoking, making them appealing for users with these habits.

### Cons of Power Swabs

- **Higher Cost:** Compared to other whitening options like strips, Power Swabs can be more expensive per use, which can be a drawback for those on a budget.
- **Temporary Results:** While many users achieve immediate results, the effects can be temporary. Maintaining white teeth may require repeated use.
- **Limited Coverage:** The swab applicator may not offer the same level of coverage as a whitening tray or professional treatment, potentially leaving some areas less whitened.

### Comparing with Other Whitening Methods

To further understand where Power Swabs stand, let’s compare them with popular whitening options:

#### Whitening Strips

Whitening strips are a popular at-home option. They are thin, flexible pieces coated with a whitening gel.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Pros:** They are widely available and often less expensive than Power Swabs. They also provide even coverage over time.
- **Cons:** Many users report experiencing gum irritation and tooth sensitivity with prolonged use.

#### Whitening Gels

These gels are typically applied using a tray that conforms to your teeth.

- **Pros:** They can offer powerful results and longer-lasting whiteness with consistent use.
- **Cons:** The process can be messy, and some users dislike wearing trays for extended periods.

#### Professional Treatments

Going to a dentist for professional whitening can yield the most dramatic results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Pros:** Dentists use stronger whitening agents, which can dramatically whiten teeth in a single session.
- **Cons:** This option can be much more expensive and may not be accessible for everyone.

### Final Thoughts

When comparing Power Swabs with other teeth whitening products, it’s essential to consider your individual needs and preferences. If you value convenience, quick results, and less sensitivity, Power Swabs may be a suitable option for you. However, if you are looking for long-term results and don’t mind investing more time or money, other methods like whitening strips or professional treatments might be better suited. Ultimately, the right choice depends on your lifestyle, dental sensitivity, and budget.

Taking the time to research your options will help you make an informed choice on the best teeth whitening method to achieve that glowing smile you desire.

Let’s cut the fluff and get to the good stuff. The story of **Horny Hamster** didn’t come out of thin air. It’s rooted in the wild legacy of hamsters that have captivated the internet for years. And yeah, it’s got a little creative flair because what’s a good legend without some spice?

# The Hamster Who Started It All

Back in 2021, the world met *Mr. Goxx*, the legendary hamster who out-traded humans. This furry little beast ran his own cryptocurrency trading office, complete with a tiny wheel connected to a computer. Every time he ran on the wheel, he selected a cryptocurrency to trade. Then, using his ""decision tunnels,"" he chose whether to buy or sell.

Sounds like a joke, right? Well, *Mr. Goxx* actually crushed it. At one point, his portfolio outperformed Bitcoin, the S&P 500, and even Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway. While everyone else was losing their minds over market crashes, this hamster was casually stacking gains like a true baller.

https://preview.redd.it/1hxh188ums7e1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=85c155f140fe0ed78cb4955c9da50d519048bd63

# Enter Hank: The Hamster Who Took It Further

Inspired by Mr. Goxx’s success, our boy Hank had bigger dreams. He wasn’t just about trades—he wanted to build a legacy. And his story? Well, it starts in a pet shop, like most hamster tales, but with a twist.

Hank was no ordinary hamster. While his cage-mates were busy hoarding seeds and running in circles, Hank was plotting. He wasn’t about the wheel life; he wanted more. One fateful night, inspired by the stories of Mr. Goxx and fueled by his own ambition, Hank made his daring escape.

# Hank’s Rise to Glory

After escaping, Hank found himself in a dingy internet café, where late-night crypto traders yelled at their screens and spilled coffee on their keyboards. That’s where he discovered *crypto*. For weeks, Hank hid in the shadows, watching traders, learning their patterns, and absorbing every bit of chaos.

But Hank didn’t just want to trade—he wanted to build something. He saw how people rallied around Mr. Goxx and thought, “Why not take it further?” He didn’t just want to hustle; he wanted to create a coin that could unite the degens, the memelords, and the crypto underdogs under one ridiculous banner.

# The Birth of $HHAM

https://preview.redd.it/q0fp3bnwms7e1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=edd867b08e9643338d41801407771df2964a5c60

Hank launched **Horny Hamster ($HHAM)** as a nod to his chaotic roots and the hamster legends that came before him. He knew it needed to be more than just another token; it needed to have a story, a purpose, and a vibe.

* **10% Burn Fund:** Because Hank learned from the best—scarcity equals value.
* **30% Community Fund:** Powered by engagement and referrals. You show up, you bring people in, and you help build the hamster empire.
* **The Rest:** To keep the project running, the hamster wheels spinning, and the community thriving.



# Why $HHAM Is Different

What makes $HHAM special isn’t just the meme factor (though it’s top-tier). It’s the perfect blend of chaos and credibility. The real story of *Mr. Goxx* shows that hamsters can truly outperform expectations. Hank’s legend adds the spirit, the ambition, and the humor that make this coin more than just a novelty.

This is a token for the underdogs, the dreamers, and the people who look at the hamster wheel of life and say, “F\*\*\* it, let's build a rocket.”



# The $HHAM Movement

$HHAM isn’t just a token; it’s a reminder that even the smallest, scrappiest creature can take on the world. It’s built on hustle, chaos, and a legacy of internet history that proves hamsters are the **ultimate degens.**

So, is Hank real? Maybe he’s just a myth, or maybe he’s running his empire from behind the scenes. What’s real is the energy, the community, and the vision of **Horny Hamster ($HHAM)**.

Join the movement, embrace the chaos, and let’s send this furry bastard to the moon. 🚀

How to improve?","So I had a 1st date with a beautiful woman last night, honestly the most beautiful woman I've taken out so far, so that was a milestone in itself. I learned a lot about myself and where my weak points are with dating, so I'm proud of myself for that. We both had fun, like all of my dates, but also, like almost all 5 of my 1st dates (excluding hookups and 1 or 2), I don't think she'll want to go out again even though she texted back enthusiastically at night afterwards.

The first issue I ran into, is I noticed I talked about myself a little bit too much. I do this to try and break away from the interview feeling, I feel like I ask good questions and genuinely want to learn more about them but for some reason last night I kind of hit a wall. And normally can hold a conversation pretty well as that's part of my job but when it comes to a date for some reason it seems harder.

This leads me to my next point, for some reason I've been getting buzzed too easily lately, most people would say it helps them with dating but for me it makes everything harder I can't focus and my brain gets lazy, should I just do coffee dates from now on or is it acceptable to get a mocktail or non-alcoholic beer?

Now on to the biggest point, I can be dominant and masculine naturally, I'm normally a somewhat serious person with a good sense of humor. My issue is on dates or with women I'm into my voice for some reason gets a little higher pitched than natural, even though I keep it downward inflection naturally. I also have trouble being flirty/playful while still maintaining the masculinity, like the male to female interaction vibes. It's not that I get feminine but for some reason I get almost childlike, hard to describe but if you've been there you'll know. I know I need to get more comfortable just being myself, trick myself into not liking them as much, and just not try so hard I guess but it's a tough thing to reframe.

Overall, I'm glad I went on this date, she was literally like a damn supermodel so I know a lot of guys would have had some trouble, and it went better than I expected. I'm glad I was able to learn more about myself and what I need to fix about myself, this was probably the most productive date for that as well.

Disclaimer I've only been dating for about a month since my 7 year relationship ended, this was my fourth 1st date in about a week, one was a hookup, so I'm still pretty new. I've already gotten much better at texting for online dating and have plenty of matches I'm attracted to that I could take out, but I'm wondering if I should just work on myself, or keep taking women out since I'm learning fast on these dates even if I'm not getting the results I want.

If anyone has advice, comments, or just cares to share their own experience or relate feel free, I appreciate the interaction on here I know once I get these few roadblocks out of the way I'll start doing much better. ",0,1734608497.0,datingadviceformen,1,0.5,False

**Connections:**

* Both are obsessed with the supernatural (for Afton it is Remnant, for Crocker it is Fairys)
* Both target children to archive it while also being in a position that entrust them with the well being of children (Afton being one of the owners of a child entertainment/pizzeria, Crocker being a teacher) 
* Both use that position to hurt (physically and mentally) children
* Both have advanced somewhat supernatural tech.
* ~~Both look like they live on toast and black coffee and nothing else~~

**Debate:** Like most of Williams MUs it depends heavily on what you give him, but in this case it also depends what one gives Crocker

For example:

Low ball for both, making them street to wall level, then Crocker wins via arsenal.

High ball for both, Abra-Catastrophe Crocker And Fnaf World Purple Guy, both could be argue to Universe level do to

* Giving Crocker fairy magic which managed to stop aging for the universe.
* Scaling Afton to Animdude (Scott Cawthon) who created him and his whole universe and arguable more.

I say Crocker still wins but it would be closer.

**Plus point:** Fairy magic can erase someone from existence, further more, make them never been born. Meaning that Crocker could, through unintentional, save all of William victims from their demise. ",3,1734608038.0,DeathBattleMatchups,0,1.0,False

Considerably researching the market and thoroughly grappling with strategic plans are vital to establishing that your new products and services will take off. Diversifying your product line can help you attract new customers, firm up your brand identity and grow revenue. 

Using Amazon FBA’s logistical support, you can explore catalog diversification with fewer operational headaches than before. So, let’s take a closer look at product line expansion as a tool to build your Amazon success, and discuss some high-level steps to make it happen.

 

# Diagnostic of Deployment and Demographics

Monitoring market trends is a key linchpin of successful product line expansions, revealing insights into what customers are looking for. With shifting consumer interests, **Amazon FBA** Sellers who change course quickly can double down on high-demand niches.

* Take the rise in eco-friendly shopping for example. Home goods sellers could add eco-friendly options to their stores — like reusable kitchen towels or bamboo storage containers. 

 **Amazon FBA** Sellers can target environmentally-conscious buyers and find a new audience for their green products just by increasing their appeal with eco-friendly delivery methods.

* Best Seller Tip: You can analyze your sales data along with customer feedback for spotting the trends. Add to this with market research tools to keep an eye on trending keywords and search volume as well as competitors’ strategies.

 

# Creating a Bundle that Adds Value

Product bundling can help you increase the value customers think they are getting, while also encouraging them to purchase multiple products. Bundles are particularly useful for familiarizing customers with a wider selection of your offering.

* For example, a skincare seller might provide a trio of a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer. It is ideal for customers looking for an all-in-one into their skincare routine and position yourself as an expert in the space. Bundles also show up as unique search item types, allowing **Amazon FBA** Sellers to gain visibility over their competitors.
* Pro Tip for Sellers: Use Amazon’s virtual bundle tool (if available in your region) to try out different combinations of products before committing to physical packaging changes. Track the performance of these bundles so you can improve this strategy.

 

# Branching Out Into Seasonal Products

Seasonal product expansion enables **Amazon FBA** Sellers to take advantage of peak purchasing seasons. Items that are seasonal, like Christmas-themed home décor or Halloween costumes, tend to have predictable surges in demand, which can make them a demandable addition to your catalog.

* For instance, if you sell kitchenware, you might introduce festive bakeware sets around the winter holidays. Not only do these additions drive sales within the season, they also generate top-of-mind awareness with customers that can lead to repeat purchases across other categories.
* Pro Tip for Sellers: Schedule seasonal launches long term in advance. Use historical sales data to project demand and avoid overstocking items with limited appeal beyond the season.

 

# Catering to Niche Lifestyles

More than ever before, modern shoppers flock to products that match their particular lifestyles. Less saturated niches can also cultivate a strong sense of customer loyalty for **Amazon FBA** Sellers whose offerings branch into these specific areas.

* For instance, if you sell travel accessories, you could add compact laundry bags or portable laptop desks to your shop for digital nomads. Such targeted expansions give you a way to go deep with niche buyers and reach more buyers broadly.

 Visit forums, online social media groups and platforms to spot gaps in the market and fill the niches accordingly etc.

 

# Hearing Customer Feedback for Expansion Ideas

For the **Amazon FBA** Sellers planning on expanding their product line, customer feedback is a treasure trove of information. Reviews and inquiries often highlight unmet needs or enhancements buyers would like to see.

* As an example, a seller of hiking gear who received feedback on how difficult it was to stay hydrated on long hikes might introduce a compact hydration pack to solve this pain point. Customer feedback-led expansion guarantees the solutions you build are driven by actual demand to protect the products you make from dying on the shelf.
* For SellersPro Tip: Use your “Customer Questions & Answers” and product reviews as a means to know what the buyer needs? Maintain a record of recurring themes for future product development.

 

#  Introducing Premium Variants for Upscale Buyers

Premium products enable **Amazon FBA** Sellers to access a new audience of big spenders. Introducing new products with higher materials, better features, or exclusive designs enables sellers to increase average order values while improving their brand image.

* For example, if a seller offers regular kitchen knives, they could create a premium collection made up of Japanese steel blades and ergonomic handles. These products are designed for professional chefs or cooking enthusiasts willing to spend up for products.
* Tip for Sellers: Use aspirational products/ variants with high-quality images and one-of-a-kind descriptions.

 

# Diversifying Into Related Categories

Adjacent categories are a way for you to expand upon what you already offer. Capture most of your target audience’s spending by expanding into related categories.

* So, if your focus is yoga mats, think about other yoga products, such as yoga blocks, straps, or apparel. So they will likely explore complementary products that all offer the option to cross-selling as they are customers already interested in your products.
* Seller Pro Tip: Go to your product pages and check the “Customers Also Bought” section to see what categories your products are often purchased with. 

 

# Utilizing Cross-Selling for Increased Order Value

Once you have a broader range of products in your product line, the potential for cross-selling expands. They are items that act as supplementary products that will entice customers to increase their baskets (and your revenue). 

* If, for example, you sell camping tents, offer sleeping bags, lanterns, or portable stoves. These items meet customers’ wider needs while amplifying their journey with your brand.

Pro Tip for Sellers: Utilize your product detail pages to showcase complementary products by creating your own, custom “frequently bought together” bundles or utilize Amazon’s brand storefront.

 

# Releasing Limited Edition Products

Scarcity and exclusivity — limited-edition products make them want to buy right away. These launches are also a great way to try new things with minimal investment in inventory.

* For instance, a stationery vendor could launch a limited-edition planner with unique artwork for the back-to-school season. These types of products not only bring in new customers, but also deepen brand loyalty with current customers.
* Seller Pro Tip: Offer limited-edition products, promote them across social media and email, and see sales velocity increase.

 

# Broadening Price Points to Engage More Buyers

Offering products in different price ranges can appeal to a wider audience. You can range from entry-level to mid-level and premium, allowing you to serve the budget-conscious and the high-roller audiences.

* For example, a fitness company might sell a basic beginners style resistance band set, an advanced enthusiasts style set, and a full professional style set with extra accessories, etc.
* Sellers tip: Each price tier should clearly outline the feature and benefits otherwise it confuses your customer and dilutes your brand message.

 

# How Product Line Expansion Supports Better Customer Retention

Customers are less tempted by competitors when multiple products fit their needs in your catalog. For example, **Amazon FBA** Sellers in pet supplies may start selling highly indulgent dog food and branch out into related categories – like grooming tools, toys or pet travel. 

When they have a wide variety of products to choose from, the customers are going to consider the seller as a one-stop shop for all their purchases related to pets and become more inclined to stay loyal to the business.

 

# Ensuring Customer Satisfaction Beyond the First Purchase

By addressing their problems in a 360-degree way, this can be one of the biggest secret recipes for customer retention. Expanding your product line enables you to meet the varying needs of your audience at the same time they will be looking for solutions elsewhere.

* For example, if your business sells fitness gear, you may want to branch out from selling yoga mats, to foam rollers, to resistance bands so that your customers can build their entire fitness routine around your brand. By not having to shop from multiple **Amazon FBA** Sellers, this approach creates loyalty.
* Pro Tip: Analyze your customers purchasing behavior to discover other products you can offer them that make sense based on their interests. You can also look for expansion opportunities using Amazon’s “Frequently Bought Together” insights.

 

# Consistency: The Strategy for Brand Loyalty

Customers who care for your product will want trusting in other products from your brand. Broadening your product line allows you to leverage that trust.

* For example, a seller who sells organic skincare products could eventually expand into adjacent categories like body care and haircare. The customers who become loyal to the quality of your facial cleansers or serums will be more likely to purchase your new products, too.
* Pro Tip: It is important to keep your whole product line consistent. As a result, customers will only remain loyal as long as every product meets their expectations.

 

# Niche Solution Can Tighten the Bond

While modern consumers lean toward brands that reflect their own lifestyles and values. This allows you to develop a closer, emotional connection by branching into niche products — furthering the alignment with your audience.

* For example, if you specialize in travel accessories, offering eco-friendly packing cubes or baggage tags will attract environmentally-conscious consumers. This not only helps with retention but also establishes your brand as one that knows and cares about its audience’s values.
* Pro Tip: Provide the necessary prospective niche and individual values through customer feedback and social media listening.

 

# Sell Consumables to Find Repeat Purchases

Consumables — food, cosmetics or cleaning supplies — have a built-in retention advantage because customers must reorder them. Even more importantly, you can be guaranteed repeat business if you extend your product line to these categories.

* So, if you sell coffee makers, a line of branded coffee beans or cleaning tablets creates repeat-purchase cycles. In fact, customers are not only coming back for the original item you sold to them but also to purchase the consumables that will let them maintain or use that original item.

Did you know? Make the option to subscribe on consumables to drive consistent repeat purchases and increased retention!

 

# Expanding Into Seasonal Products for Year-Round Engagement

# Why It Works to Expand Seasonal Products

The demands of each season and holiday are unique. From summer barbecues to Halloween costumes and Christmas decorations, shoppers are looking for products that suit the moment. By tapping into these seasonal needs, **Amazon FBA** Sellers become relevant and trustworthy and earn a repeat visit. 

Seasonal items also lend themselves to impulse buying—one of the strongest forces that compel customers to make a purchase.

* For example, a home décor seller might start offering Christmas-themed candles in the winter or Easter-themed table runners in spring. These products excel at certain times throughout the year, attracting buyers who are specifically searching for these items.

 

# Implementing Seasonal Product Expansion

Seasonal product expansion is a fine line to walk and it necessitates proper future planning and market research. Start by researching your niche and noting relevant holidays or seasonal themes. A seller of fitness equipment might sell branded water bottles in summer or smart giftable yoga kits around the holidays.

Look to your current catalog for inspiration. Perhaps, if you sell party supplies, you’ll launch a seasonal line of themed decorations.

 If you work in fashion, think of seasonal clothing or accessories. By harnessing your existing expertise, you can create seasonal products that appeal to your audience.

* A home décor seller who used to only sell year-round products, like vases and wall art. They found that by extending into seasonal-themed pieces, such as Halloween-themed candle holders or Valentine’s Day wreaths, they were able to see a significant spike in sales during those time periods. 

Over the years, loyal consumers started to check back with their store every year for new seasonal collections ensuring themselves as the go-to seasonal brand.

 

# Increasing Customer Lifetime Value Through Upselling

For customers who buy from you, they already have trust in your brand at least once. Upselling leverages this solid relationship to provide them more advanced solutions or premium offerings that are in line with their objectives. 

These upgrades help to add value to the customer, thereby motivating them to come back to you and buy again.

* So, a seller of kitchenware may first sell a starter knife set. Eventually they might bring out a pro-style knife set that could have ergonomic handles or high-carbon stainless steel.

Customers who liked the basic set might view the upgraded version as a valuable investment and increase their total lifetime spend with the brand.

 

# Offering Exclusive Deals for Returning Customers

The next step to success long-term on **Amazon FBA** is to build customer loyalty, and offering exclusive deals for repeat customers is one of the best methods to accomplish this. This is where product line expansion presents a unique opportunity for **Amazon FBA** sellers to profit off their growing catalog while rewarding their loyal customers. 

 

# What Makes Exclusive Deals Attractive to Repeat Customers

Your best asset is the repeat customer. You already have established trust and brand reputation with them and they are more likely to buy more from your brand than one-time customers.

 Providing them with exclusive deals not only drives repeat business but also makes them feel valued, which plays a significant role in customer retention.

Use this by sending loyal customers a discount code for early access when launching a new product. 

* For example, a skincare brand that is releasing a new serum might send an exclusive 20% discount code to customers who previously bought from their moisturizer line. This generates excitement and a view of exclusivity, which helps to bring immediate and future sales.

 

# Creating a One-Stop Shopping Experience

delivering a one-stop shopping experience for your customers could be a killer app. Introducing product lines in categories they already associate you with helps you meet a wider range of customer needs, ensuring that they rely less on your competition.

 You naturally promote customer retention and the long-term growth of your brand by presenting yourself as the one-stop solution for their needs.

 

# Why One-Stop Shopping Works

Shoppers today place a high value on convenience. When you can cover all their needs in one place, they are less likely to look for other brands.

 Adding complementary products helps establish your store as the one-stop-shop for everything customers look for and allows them to find all they need in one place without having to go elsewhere.

* As an example, an outdoors dealer can define cheap hiking boots, portable cooking devices, and water filtration systems. A customer that buys a tent from you could also choose to buy these associated items, enjoying the convenience of 1 checkout process.

 

# The Guide To One Of The One-Stop Shop

* Identify Complementary Categories: Begin with an analysis of your product mix What do your customers most often buy in conjunction with one another? For instance, if you are selling yoga mats, think of selling yoga blocks, straps, or even yoga apparel.
* Give your customers great value for money by bundling your products. An outdoor gear seller, for example, might create a camping bundle that includes a tent, sleeping bag and portable stove.
* So, if you are expanding your product range, use the storefront to give a little highlight on your storefront. Group your products into easy-to-navigate categories and put a spotlight on your variety.
* Use product descriptions to suggest other products. For example, on a hiking boots product page, promote an exclusive deal on trekking poles.

For example, a seller who sells camping tents observed that many customers were buying lanterns and sleeping bags from other sellers as well. 

In order to serve this market, they start to offer these items, making their store a one-stop shop for outdoor enthusiasts. Inclusion of targeted marketing banners, optimized listings, and engaging storage ideas, boosted the seller’s average order value and encouraged repeat purchase.

 

# Launching Premium Versions of Your Existing Products

# Differentiate Premium Products with Clear Value Additions

One of the most important guidelines in launching a premium product is to provide clear, tangible benefits over your standard product. Such value additions can be more premium material, better functionality, or exclusivity driving a higher price point.

* Just imagine a seller selling basic stainless steel tumblers at a price of $15. For a more premium version, the seller could use 18/8 stainless steel, add a copper liner for temperature retention, and an ergonomic lid with a sliding mechanism. The $35 premium tumbler is designed for customers who care about durability and performance.

So, when creating your product listing, it is important to express these value additions. Focus on the limited-boundary improvements that differentiate the pro from the normal.

 Rather than just writing “Enhanced design,” for example, write, “Made with high-grade stainless steel for 10 times the durability and double-wall insulation to keep drinks cold for 24 hours.”

Try running the same ad or description but test to see whether buyers prefer “anti-leak technology” or “extra-large capacity.” Use this data to hone the features of your premium product. Delivering real-world value makes the product attractive too. 

* For example, if you’re selling fitness resistance bands, explain how the premium version offers higher resistance levels for advanced training or pairs with a workout guide for more bang for their buck. Practical benefits like these speak to buyers as they make the price of the premium product even more attractive.

 

# Optimize Product Packaging for a Premium Feel

For premium products, the experience begins even before the customer opens their box. Having great packaging does wonders in establishing expectations and increasing the perceived value of your product. 

Not only do premium packaging ensure product security, but also improve the unboxing experience, making the first impression of your buyers unforgettable.

 

# Why Packaging Matters

More luxe packaging also indicates quality and care. It speaks to consumers who equate quality products with high-quality presentation. For **Amazon FBA** sellers, with shoppers that typically cannot act on the product or feel it, pictures of luxurious packaging can mean all the difference when it comes to standing out.

 

* A coffee seller could elevate traditional paper bag packaging to reusable tins or giftable boxes. These not only add an elegant touch, but also provide a practical function, like keeping the coffee fresh. They may want to give premium coffee blends too, and eye-catching packaging makes the decision easier for them as well.

 

# How to Stand out on Packaging in Amazon

For premium [product packaging](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-attractive-product-packaging-improves-amazon-fba-reviews/), take high-quality images that highlight its unique design and features. Demonstrate how the packaging communicates the product’s luxury status, be it gold foiling, eco-friendly materials, or designs that are gift-ready. Use macros and lifestyle shots that illustrate the packaging’s sophistication.

* Tip: Include the exact packaging in your [product title](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/writing-balanced-product-title-features/) & description. For instance: “Reusable Designer Tin of Premium Arabica Coffee Blend – Ready to Give!” Highlighting this feature makes you attractive to both individuals and someone trying to find the perfect gift.

 

# Set Your Prices Intelligently to Align With Quality

Pricing is paramount when introducing a premium product. Higher pricing not only signals superior quality, but it also helps to market the product as exclusive and desirable. Still, the price needs to seem justified relative to the extra value provided.

Premium pricing conveys a message to customers regarding the quality of a product. Your product is also at risk of becoming less attractive to those that want to buy high end if you price it too low. On the other hand, overcharging without providing real value would lead to low sales. The key is to find the right balance.”

* A seller of basic yoga mats for $30, say, might now sell an eco-friendly, extra-thick yoga mat for $75. Eco-minded buyers willing to pay to get sustainable materials and additional comfort in the premium version. That hefty price tag makes it feel exclusive without scaring away price-sensitive shoppers.

 

# Tips for Strategic Pricing

Do competitive research and find out what similar premium products are being charged. Factor in the cost of materials, production, and packaging, as well as the perceived value of extras. During the launching phase, provide introductory discounts to your early adopters.

Psychological pricing, like $74.99 instead of $75 has the same effect; it sounds a little cheaper while keeping a premium appeal. 

 

# Write Persuasive and Detailed Product Descriptions

Unlike basic product description that goes only over the rudimentary features, a premium product description creates an emotional connection with your buyer. Using the kind of vibrant descriptiveness that emphasizes the product’s prestige, uniqueness and increased worth.

 

# Why Descriptions Matter

When purchasing premium products, customers like to feel certain about what they are buying. A good description puts their mind at ease that this product is a worthy investment. It also gives them the information they need to make an informed decision.

* So, instead of: “Made of stainless steel,” try: “Constructed of premium-finish stainless steel, engineered to provide maximum durability and elegance for the sophisticated consumer.

 

# Making Descriptions Engaging

Use words describing the senses, like “sleek,” “velvety,” and “precision-engineered.” Focus more on benefits than on features. Rather than saying, “Made with durable materials,” speak to how it will “last for years while staying in pristine condition.”

* Pro Tip: A description of your product with the words, “luxury,” “exclusive,” and “high-end,” can only serve you well in appealing to consumers looking for premium products.

 

# Leverage Storytelling with Amazon A+ Content

Amazon A+ Content lets you enhance your product page with rich visual and interactive content. This is particularly useful in the case of a premium product because a greater platform can be carved out to explain its differentiators.

Shoppers are interested in the story behind premium items. A+ Content allows you to visually present your craftsmanship, materials, design process, etc. It aids in establishing your brand’s credibility and authority as well.

* For instance, a seller of leather wallets could make an A+ Content module that features sourcing premium leather, handcrafting each wallet, and durability tests on each wallet. Add images, videos etc. to make the storytelling lively

However, they do not consider the value offered, and you can use A+ Content to compare your premium product to the standard version, informing them of upgrades, and highlighting the additional value given.

 

# Introducing Subscription Products in Your Line Expansion

# Identify the Right Products for Subscription Services

The most important products for subscriptions, are consumables or the daily needs products which customers will regularly purchase.

Subscription business works very well with these products since they guarantee the continuous demand. Good stuff is food, beverage, beauty products, pet supplies or household stuff.

* For example, a skincare brand could create a subscription set-up to send face creams or serums to avoid customers running out of the product or buying again at the store. This works really well if your customer buys that product every day which needs to be replenished every month🧴.

Tip: Analyze customer purchase data or feedback to understand the best performing reorders. Doing so will help you figure out what products would be a good fit for your subscription collection, increasing your chances of success.

 

Providing Different Plans for Subscription

The secret sauce to a great subscription model is flexibility. As every customer has specific needs, it is essential to provide several options for delivery frequency.

Breaking subscriptions into per week, bi-weekly, or monthly increments fits different lifestyles while ensuring consumers only order products they need.

* For instance, a pet supplies seller might provide subscriptions to dog food. Some customers may want monthly deliveries, while others, with smaller pets or less aggressive feeding habits, may only need shipments on a bi-weekly or even quarterly basis.

Indicate the flexibility of your subscription service in the product description and in the FAQPage. Providing clear communication on the next steps required to either pause, cancel, or modify subscriptions will help to alleviate customer anxiety and instill confidence in the process.

 

Provide Special Discounts to Subscribers

Everyone loves a deal, and a subscription-based pricing model is a great way to include exclusive discounts in the equation.

Provide a discounted price for customers willing to cover a subscription on a regular basis, if possible; it will give a stronger incentive to choose the subscription over the one-time purchase. Such a move generates customer retention plus consistent sales.

* An example would be a vitamin seller that gives you 10 percent off if you opt in for regular deliveries. But since there is free shipping, as well as the discount, this offer is far more appealing, especially for customers with larger orders.

Tip: Use your [product listings](https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/5-common-mistakes-made-in-amazon-product-listings-and-how/332068) to promote the subscription aspect of your product as cost saving, creating a costs comparison table. If customers can show how much they save over time, they are more likely to subscribe.

 

Focus on the Environmental Benefits

More consumers are becoming eco-friendly and value-wise consumers, and thus subscriptions on hair care and skincare products are getting more common.

Your subscription service can be the sustainable choice that supports the health of the planet by way of minimizing packaging waste and utilizing refillable or recyclable packaging.

* For instance, a seller of reusable cleaning products might also offer a subscription service for refill packs instead of full kits of products. “In this way, customers would simply receive the refills, thus minimizing waste and making the service more sustainable.

Prevention: Add sustainable messaging to product titles, product details, and product photos on Amazon. Slogans such as “Eco-Friendly Subscription” or “Reduce Waste with Every Refill” will appeal to these environmentally-conscious individuals and also serve to differentiate your brand.

 

Create a Sense of Exclusivity

Offer subscriber-only incentives to ensure that your program is unique and feels special. Such perks — from early access to new products and limited-edition items to members-only discounts — help foster a sense of belonging and appreciation.

* For instance, a gourmet snack company may offer subscribers exclusive, limited-edition or seasonal flavors not available to the general public. Subscribers could also be sent exclusive free samples of upcoming products to further excite and engage them.

TIP: Leverage Amazon’s email campaigns and social media to promote these exclusive offers. That exclusivity creates a sense of customer urgency and can drive registrations and customer loyalty.

 

Promote the Savings of Amazon’s Subscribe & Save

One of these is Amazon’s Subscribe & Save, a great subscription management tool that’s beneficial both for sellers and customers. Even better is that this program calculates and applies discounts for repeating deliveries; you get two for one, comfort AND savings!

* For instance, a cleaning supplies brand could offer a discount to encourage a subscription of multiple products (such as cleaning sprays, sponges and wipes) via Amazon Subscribe & Save. This not only keeps more customers on the platform, it also breeds bigger purchases.

Tip: Make Amazon’s Subscribe & Save clear in your product descriptions, and help customers understand how it benefits them. Employ terms such as “save up to 15%” and “auto-delivery convenience” to emphasize value.

 

# Use Engaging Content to Promote Subscriptions

For subscription-facing products, good product imagery and enticing descriptions are key. Use A+ Content to create visually rich, informative listings highlighting the benefits of subscribing. Emphasize how the service can save them time, effort and provide a consistent supply of superior products.

* Example: Simply a tea brand could use [A+ Content](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-resolve-a-content-upload-issues-on-amazon-fba/) to document the journey of their leaves, from the farm to the cup, and explain how a subscription means never running out of fresh, quality leaves.

Tip: Include high-quality photos, including lifestyle images that demonstrate the product in real-life context. Using customer testimonials encouraging the ease of use and quality of the subscription will also help improve conversation rates.

 

# Encourage Subscriptions With Initial Freebies

Encourage customers to try your subscription service with a free gift or trial. A small reward can be a big motivator for the half-interested customers to actually spend on a subscription. And, on top of that, free gifts are a great way to reinforce your brand’s value too, leading to customer retention.

* For instance, a fitness supplement seller might include a free shaker bottle or a sample pack of best products with the first subscription order. This added treat shows customers they are valued and encourages them to stay subscribed.

 

Tip: Highlight the freebie in your product images, title, or description, and make it clear that it’s available only to subscribers. A catchy phrase like “First Order Gets a Free Shaker Bottle!” can grab attention.

 

# Monitor And Continuously Optimize Performance

Now that you have launched your subscription service, you can track specific metrics to keep your service running smoothly; these are churn rates, customer feedback and subscription duration. 

By examining this information, you can pinpoint where to better, and adjust accordingly to create a better experience for customers.

 

* For example, If a seller for cleaning products observes that a lot of customers cancel their subscriptions after three months, they may provide incentives such as a discount or free gift on reaching one year of subscription.

Tip: Follow up with customers via email after their first subscription delivery thanking them and asking for feedback and any concerns. Use this insight to improve the service, tweak offerings, and customize the subscription experience.

 

# Scaling Marketing Campaigns for New Product Lines

A carefully considered marketing strategy is the bedrock of any effective launch. From there, your first step will be to define your target market, become informed about their pain points, and customize your message. 

Consider the key benefits of your new line of products — how do they help alleviate a customer problem or improve a customer lifestyle, for example?

* For example, if introducing a line of eco-friendly cleaning products, the messaging could highlight sustainability, non-toxic ingredients and health benefits for families.

Tip: Use customer personas to sharpen your strategy. But you can also glean insights from tools like Amazon’s Brand Analytics or using your own customer data to identify high-level segments.

 

# Use Amazon Sponsored Ads for Quick Visibility

**Amazon FBA** includes tools that can help put your new product line in front of potential customers just with paid ads, such as [Amazon Sponsored Products](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mistakes-to-avoid-with-amazon-sponsored-products/), Sponsored Brands, and Sponsored Display ads. Especially in the earlier stages of the launch phase, these ads drive sales.

* Sponsored Products: Advertise specific products to show within search results or on product detail pages.
* Sponsored Brands: Generate awareness by serving a banner ad featuring several products from your new line.
* Sponsored display — Re-target customers that show interest in similar products or visited your product page

For example: You are launching a new line of yoga equipment. You can use [Sponsored Brands](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-sponsored-brands-ads-a-quick-tutorial/) to create a customized banner featuring your entire product line and direct traffic back to your store or a cohesive landing page.

\`Tip: Start with automated targeting from **Amazon FBA** but keep an eye on your campaigns and optimize keywords and CTR. So you can concentrate on the most viable keywords.

 

# Incorporate Social Proof and User-Generated Content

Social proof plays a vital role in the purchase process of a buyer. Use existing reviews, testimonials or influencer endorsements to establish credibility for your new product line. You can harness user-generated content, including reviews, ratings, or unboxing videos, to share across your marketing channels.

* For example, say you’re launching a new high-performance blender: The customer reviews included in your content should discuss how the kit has made it easier to whip up smoothies or adopt healthier habits.

 By using social media, you can also share unboxing videos that would capture the feeling of getting your product.

Tip: Use Amazon’s “Request a Review” button to follow up post-purchase to encourage customers to leave reviews. Think about providing modest incentives such as discounts or entry into a raffle to encourage reviews.

 

# Schedule Email Marketing Campaigns for Hype and Customer Retention

Email marketing helps to expand your campaigns and to keep your customers’ ear. Mirroring pre-launch excitement will create early buzz; it’ll also stimulate customers to spend money before your product hits the market. 

Once your storefront is live, leverage email marketing to drive repeat business by announcing new arrivals, promotions, and personalized recommendations.

* For instance, if you are unveiling a new line of gym clothes, begin by designing an email that teases your subscribers about the collection. Once you launch, target with emails that offer product recommendations based on historical purchase behavior.

 

Tip: You should segment your email list so that you can personalize emails as per the customer’s preference and previous buying behavior. You are not going to convert many customers this way, but it helps to know that personalized emails have a much greater engagement and conversion as well.

 

# Collaborate With Brand Ambassadors And Affiliates

For a new product line, especially in a niche market, influencer marketing can drastically improve product visibility. Generating trust and credibility quickly can happen by partnering with influencers who resonate with your target audience.

* For example, if you have a new line of organic skincare products, collaborate with beauty influencers who are well-known in the health-focused niche. Their endorsement can deliver immediate traffic and create brand awareness.

Tip: Find out micro-influencers with good engagement rates, not just with big follower numbers. These influencers usually have more engaged and niche audiences.

 

# Social Media Lookalike Audiences on Target

Social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram provide options for you to target “lookalike audiences” — customers who have qualities similar to those of your best existing customers.

 You can upload your customer data onto these platforms and create custom audiences to bring the customers that have higher chances of conversion.

* For instance, if you have a successful line of workout shoes and are going to release a new line of activewear, you have an existing customer base that you can use to target lookalike audiences on Facebook. These new possible clients will possibly value your image’s wellness-related items.

Also use dynamic product ads (DPA) to serve users the products they displayed an interest in automatically. Because users see products they might actually purchase.

Since we split we stayed in touch, meeting up for an occasional coffee or walk with the dog (who has stayed with me) we tried to ""stay friends"" and in some ways that was nice, when he's sober he's a lovely guy, he's been a part of my life for 4 years and I wouldn't have stayed that long if there weren't happy times. But slowly things have started to feel stressful. A few disclosures from him about stuff that happened when we were together- the last 6 months of our relationship where I thought he was sober he was drinking 2-3x a week and I had no freaking idea. It's been an adjustment and there's been things he's revealed that have cast a darker shadow on my happier memories with him which has been hard. I'd been thinking about how to cut contact without damaging him, he's not in a good place and I felt like I would be a terrible trigger for his depression and drinking if I did. 

I've been dating again and that has been exciting, I tried to avoid telling him because I knew he'd find it hard to hear, but eventually he asked me outright and I answered honestly. I had put a clear barrier in that I wasn't going to tell him all about it, him knowing I was dating was the end of the discussion.

2 nights ago he came over to mine to ""drop off the dogs christmas present"". He was visibly upset and obviously had been drinking, said something about it being too hard to see me anymore. I encouraged him to go home and go to bed, call his parents. He left in floods of tears with a loaded comment about being ""done"". I later got a tonne of messages about how low he was and the comment that was the final straw ""when I kill myself I'll be thinking of you"". I was horrified but also want to be as far away from this situation now as possible. I sent some supportive messages, got his mum involved and stepped away. 

He tried to apologise over messages to me yesterday, I've sent a nice but clear response that space is what we both need and we shouldn't talk anymore as it's for the best. He has replied to say he agrees and accepts it which I'm glad about. I haven't blocked his number yet but I'm hoping he sticks to our agreement, I can't handle any more messages like the other night.

I thought it would be a lot harder to let him go completely, but it turns out the cumulative trauma of the past 5 years has made this a much easier decision. I think there's a part of me that's a little sad, but overall I can't cope with the anxiety that comes with him in my life. 

As for me, I've been seeing someone new now for 2 months, he's lovely, he has a healthy normal relationship with alcohol and I'm excited about my next chapter.",1,1734607006.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False

Link to YouTube review: [https://youtu.be/QZ-Sj4rGYV4?si=L3SKumJj68BARJG2](https://youtu.be/QZ-Sj4rGYV4?si=L3SKumJj68BARJG2)

If you recognise me from this sub or my YouTube, you'll know that all of my reviews contain binaural sound and ANC samples, as well as frequency response measurements. These review elements, I hope, add a layer of objectivity to the practical aspects of the review alongside my own subjective thoughts.

**INTRO**

Having been reviewing earbuds for around five years now, I've been amazed this year at how much you can get with a $100, even $50 budget. Decent ANC (at least for low frequency sounds), dual driver, xMEMS drivers, LE audio, endless customisation and even spatial audio, once the exclusive domain of Apple and Samsung's flagship models, is the norm nowadays rather than the exception. It's definitely a good thing, but it also means everyone is on a pretty level playing field, creating so much choice you get analysis paralysis trying to work out whether to buy Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, OnePlus Buds 3 and Realme Buds Air 6 Pro when they all look so similar on paper, and in reality, only differ slightly in emphasis rather than quality.

If you don't know about FIIL, they've been on the periphery of mainstream TWS without quite making a mark. They were the OEM supplier for Earfun with their Free Pro and Free Pro 2 re-badging the T1 Pro and T2 Pro. They are a brand that has always intrigued me, with interesting designs that break away from the norm a little. But whilst their newest release, the Key Pro, is probably their most orthodox-looking TWS to date, it does have a trick up it's sleeve that makes it a compelling choice if you happen to fit into their target market.

The Key Pro retails on the FIIL site for around £55, but it has dropped as low as £30 recently on AliExpress. They've paired a single 10mm wool basin dynamic driver with an Airoha multipoint-capable Bluetooth 5.4 chipset. There's no LE audio and no hi-res codecs, but having seen the mess some of their competitors have made of trying to integrate those features (ahem, Moondrop) maybe that's not a bad thing!

**DESIGN**

FIIL partner with German design house 'designaffairs', and this relationship has been pretty successful over the years, with both brands sweeping up design awards, including the ubiquitous Red Dot Award for Innovation! The charge case is small and squareish - kinda like a makeup mirror - with a semi-transparent lid and a nice orientation that makes it straightforward to get the buds in and out. It's super portable and is one of the reasons these have become my daily driver. 

The buds themselves are pretty unspectacular. They're in matte gunmetal grey to match the charge case, with a fairly short stem and flat surface to initiate the controls. The big unique selling point of the Key Pro, though, is related to how the buds are worn. Not only are these in-ear, with hybrid active noise cancellation and silicone tips, but through a small adapter they can be almost seamlessly converted to semi-in-ear. Imagine the Airpods Pro morphing into traditional Airpods when you need them - that's the Key Pro's super power.

Why would you need this? For people who don't understand and don't need this, it might feel completely unnecessary, but for me, my ears get tired, stuffy and sweaty after using silicone tips for long periods. I often find myself carrying two sets into the office - typically the Moondrop Moca and Realme Buds Air 6 Pro, so I can benefit from ANC when I need it, then switch to the Moca when my ears start to hurt or I need to hear my co-workers shouting over at me. Of course, I could always just switch on transparency, but it isn't the same - I've still got things stuffed in my ears and ambient mode is only really suitable if you're using it for close-up conversations.

The Key Pro solves the problem of owning or carrying two sets by fulfilling both criterion. In in-ear mode, they're pretty comfortable, even despite the larger, oval-shaped nozzles, similar in dimensions to Huawei Freebuds Pro series, Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, Redmi Buds 5 Pro, etc. The stock tips are nice and grippy, giving good stability. They passed the '100 jumping jack' test easily and their IPX5 moisture rating makes them good gym buddies.

Removing the tips and adding a small conversion adapter turns them into semi-in-ear mode. It isn't quite an Airpod clone in this configuration - more like the original 1MORE Comfobuds, and a similar principal to what 1MORE did with the Fit Open S50, giving you dual fit options. But unlike 1MORE there's no storage solution for these adapters, and that's an opportunity missed IMO. The whole point of having these two modes is being able to switch between them very quickly and easily. If I have no safe and secure method of transporting these adapters, such as a drawer built into the case, I'm much less likely to use them as intended. So a bit of a shame, really.

Once you've installed the adapter, it is advised to switch to semi-in-ear mode in the app to benefit from audio optimisation. You lose MAF (FIIL's name for ANC) in this configuration, which is also a shame since many even budget products like QCY HT10 and Soundpeats Air5 are offering this functionality. The stability in semi-in-ear mode is fine unless you try and use them for exercise - they dropped out of my ears after only 6 jumping jacks - but in general use they are more comfortable than most semi-in-earbuds and perfectly stable - fine for a brisk walk to get the train, at least in my ears (your mileage may vary)

**ANC AND TRANSPARENCY**

The hybrid active noise cancellation is about on par for the price point - effective when dealing with lower frequency sounds, less so for conversations. My testing in a busy coffee shop showed performance similar to the Moondrop Moca, though the Key Pro doesn't quite match the QCY MeloBuds Pro or Earfun Air 2 NC when it comes to reducing voices and other mid-frequency sounds. The overall noise reduction puts them solidly mid-table in the sub-$100 category. There's a binaural ANC recording in said coffee shop in the YouTube review if you want to hear if for yourself.

MAF gives you five different modes. You can toggle between ANC on and off either through the app or by holding the left bud for a couple of seconds. Monitor and Open modes both handle transparency, and both seem to do the job in a slightly different way. The 'Wind' mode does a decent job with breeze reduction, but don't expect much other noise reduction when it's active.

Being able to switch ANC modes during calls is really handy, but it's disappointing that you can't use ANC in single bud mode. Transparency is not bad by any means, but one of those modes is good for close conversations but not further away ones, and the other does the reverse. A combination of both would be ideal! I also found it could feel a little 'stuffy' with either mode, so some way short of the experience on the transparency kings - the Apple Airpod Pro 2.

**SOUND**

The Key Pro delivers a full, rich sound signature that really emphasizes the bass without going full-on Soundcore. There's a a slight EQ shift when you switch ANC off, with the sound signature turning to a brighter, Harman-hugging profile. There's more bite to percussion and more emphasis on female vocals, whereas with ANC on, you get a warmer presentation with more bass emphasis. It's a well-controlled and moderately textured bass - there's a slight lingering quality to it, but it's punchier than its boomier contemporaries from Soundcore and Earfun.

Despite the mids being recessed, they've managed to strike a nice balance between energy and musicality. The soundstage is fairly moderate and the imaging isn't going to blow you away, but that's pretty standard for TWS at this price point. FIIL has clearly played to the strengths of their driver choice here with two distinct sound profiles, both of which are usable. The FIIL app gives you tons of room to tweak the sound - you get three official EQs (bass, treble and normal), 12 preset options (Classic is particularly good for opening up the soundstage), and a proper 10-band custom EQ with a generous ±10 dB range - much better than the typical ±6 dB you get with most TWS. The driver quality is good - the distortion is low, even in the lower frequencies, so the room for maneuver isn't just limited to the app.

The Key Pro lands at number 11 in my subjective sound league table, and with a bit more soundstage width, they'd have almost certainly cracked the top 10. Remember, all of my YouTube reviews have binaural sound samples, so you can hear what the buds sound like for yourself, without having to take my word for it.

If you follow my reviews closely, you'll know that hi-res codecs are not a massive deal to me, as even using Tidal Hifi the difference is barely perceptible. The Key Pro doesn't give you a choice, topping out with AAC.

**CALL QUALITY**

Call performance isn't the Key Pro's strongest suit, but it's certainly acceptable. Your voice comes through a bit soft and occasionally gets lost in the noise reduction processing, but it's serviceable for most situations. and seems to handle wind better than many budget offerings. I've included lengthy call samples in real-life scenarios in the YouTube review.

**OTHER FEATURES & BATTERY LIFE**

Multipoint connectivity isn't enabled out of the box - you'll need to turn it on in the settings - but once it's active, it works really well. The voice prompts for device connection ('Bluetooth 1 connected' etc) are clear without being annoying. It's the usual mechanism of pausing one device to trigger the other.

The gaming experience is interesting - without low latency mode, I got close on 400ms of delay on my Sony Xperia 1 IV, which is definitely on the higher side. With gaming mode on it drops to a much more palatable circa 100ms, making it fine for casual gaming. I still prefer wired where possible, certainly for first person shooters where you'll also benefit from better directional cues with the right IEM.

The touch controls are probably the biggest annoyance with not only the Key Pro but FIIL's products in general. Not only did I get a few accidental triggers while adjusting the buds, the setup in advanced mode is pretty counterintuitive. Having to single tap the left bud for volume up or triple tap for down is FIIL's way of still giving you full control in single earbud mode, although it relies on you using the left bud - not helpful if you're deaf or partially deaf in that ear only. The frustration could be eased by allowing for customisable controls in their app, but FIIL don't give you that option, which is probably the biggest negative.

Battery life is OK - not outstanding for in-ear standards, but on the better-than-average side for semi-in-ear. You're looking at just under 6 hours with ANC off, dropping to about 4 hours with ANC on, multipoint active, and moderate call usage. The quick charge feature helps though, giving you an hour of playback from just 10 minutes of charging. This extends with the case by an additional three full cycles.

Features-wise, it's missing a few things like 'Wear Detection' and 'Find My Earbuds'. Increasingly we are seeing wireless charging in this price category, which you're not getting either. 

**SUMMARY**

Here in the earbuds subreddit, I've never seen the Key Pro recommended in the quest for good budget wireless buds, which definitely says more about FIIL's market presence than the quality of the buds. The convertible design is obviously its standout feature, but there's a lot more to like here - solid sound quality, good comfort in both modes, and perfectly acceptable ANC and call performance and ideal portability.

You're missing some nice-to-haves like wear detection sensors and wireless charging, and the control setup might even be a deal-breaker for some, but whilst they might be a harder recommendation at £55, at the current market price of around £30 they are definitely a contender. The app experience is nicer than the MeloBuds Pro, and unlike the Moondrop Moca, they aren't plagued with bugs and QC issues. The design is better and the experience more polished than the KZ Carol, and the ANC, call quality and battery life all trounce the Moondrop Space Travel. As with all budget buds, you're having to make a compromise somewhere, but for me it's good that FIIL are solid across the board whilst also offering a design differentiation that sets them apart from the crowd.

Any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

*This is not a paid or brand-affiliated review. I do this as a hobby and buy the overwhelming majority of sets I review both on Headfi and on YouTube. FIIL did send me the Key Pro(and Ultrasonic) for free, but there was no creative input into this review, no payment in exchange for the review and no terms imposed upon me, and like all of the other brands I've reviewed over the years, I've bought many of their products out of my own pocket, including the T1XS, CC2, T1 Pro and CC Pro and continue to buy product even though I could get it for free, partly to support the brands and do my bit towards encouraging innovation and partly to reinforce perceptions of my objectivity.*

However, I was told I need six sealants, a specialized gingivitis cleaning, and Invisalign to prevent my teeth from falling out in a few years.

I’m missing my second molars and all my wisdom teeth, and I still have a few baby teeth (I’m not sure of the name, but I’ll include pictures). I had a special exam done with a machine that measures the force of my overbite, and they said it’s causing my gum recession. They also told me that the test showed my teeth are wearing down quickly due to my overbite as well. I was quoted about $5k to fix most of this through Invisalign. They warned that if I don’t address these issues soon, my teeth could fall out due to the gum recession, so I need to fix it as soon as possible.

I don’t smoke, drink alcohol, and I occasionally drink seltzer water. I avoid most sugary drinks and foods, as well as coffee. Honestly, I also have a tendency to brush my teeth too aggressively with an electric toothbrush.

1hhqec8,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1hhqec8/i_have_a_near_perfect_life_but_i_will_never_get/,I have a near perfect life but I will never get in a relationship where someone couple possibly be attracted to me ,"I got my diploma at almost 30 years old. I immediately launched my company and get the full compensation for my labor. I don't even know how many hours I work but it barely feels like working (except in the morning when I hate to get out of bed). 
So I'm pretty well set. I can now imagine a future with a house. 

I have many friends and they're all pretty and handsome friends. My men friends are great guys really and are successful with women both because of their personalities and their appearances. I certainly have a good personality and people, especially women, like to talk to me. Apparently I'm so funny I have a reputation for that and people I never met expect me to be incredibly funny and apparently, I manage to keep up with these expectations. 

Yet, every time I talk to a woman I don't know or barely know (I'd never try that with a friend unless I somehow fall in love with one my girl friends (love them though)) in a more than friendly manner (ex: ask for her number or drink a coffee someday) because I like her, I either get shut down immediately and we resume in a more friendly manner or she cuts the conversation short and just leaves (I mean that they go talk to someone else sometimes without moving seat. But most women just pursue the conversation with me.). It doesn't matter that she was laughing or we had an interesting discussion about politics, science, game or whatever she likes (I somehow have at least surface level of any subject and if I don't they're always willing to teach me or tell me about it which is kinda nice of them.)

Now that's okay, appearances matter and I'm definitely trying my luck with women who are conventionally pretty. I'm not. So obviously if they are the same as me and go for the conventionally handsome, this is going nowhere. The thing is I don't think it's fair for anyone if I just decide to settle for a woman I don't think is the type of pretty that I would like. I wouldn't want a woman to do this to me. Also ""conventionally pretty"" doesn't mean ugly and it's more like ""not my taste"". 

 I don't like my face and the majority of people would say I'm either average or slightly below. That's not true. I don't know why but people's idea of averageness became flawed. So now it means ""I'm not attracted to them but they're not very unpleasant to look at"". I don't know if I'd want to change that. On one hand I'd like to be handsome but on the other hand I wish someone would still like me regardless. Like ""I'd love you even if you were a worm"" kind of thing. The last reason is that all of my handsome friends relationships don't last because, as great as these guys are with me, when the women they date stop caring about their faces it seems like they want out. It's too bad but it's because both sides of this relationship focused too much on their faces. 

So here I am, enjoying my near perfect life alone. It's not so bad but I know the idea of being alone is creeping in the corners and every night it's getting closer and closer. As if fixing every other issues of my life has awoken this one. I'll find a way to deal with that though. If a relationship is what I need to be happy then I don't want it. It should be a bonus. Next step is logging off reddit and find a sport I'd do for fun and not just to get leaner.

I had a lot of these materials on hand already so it cost me about $4. If you don't have any of the materials yet it might cost $20-$25). I put the steps to make it below if you're interested. 😊 Happy gaming!

Materials needed:
-3/4"" wooden dowel (approx 16-20"" of it)
-wood stain (optional. I stained with some walnut stain I had on hand)
-Sandpaper (optional for ends of dowels)
-printer / printer paper
-instant coffee, or strong freshly-brewed coffee
-mod podge, or other paper friendly crafters glue
-twine or string for hanging
-iron / ironing board


Instructions:
1. Print the rules - text is formatted to 6"" wide (I reformatted a little just to have important things in bold, etc. but otherwise it's right out of the rulebook.) Leave 6"" of blank space at top and bottom of rules for gluing to dowels.
2. Glued the pages together with mod podge (had to print 3 - 11x17 pages. More if you print in standard letter size). Careful not to get glue on the front of your scroll because the coffee won't stain through glue so it'll show up as a white spot on your scroll.
3. Mixed up some instant coffee and painted it on with a paper towel
4. Let air dry
5. Flip over onto blank side, throw a rag or cloth under it (in case the words bleed. Don't want to ruin your ironing board) iron out major crinkles with iron. Don't iron words side - it can smear the text. 
6. Cut 2 - 3/4"" wooden dowels to approx 8"" long each, or whatever looks good to you. Hand sand ends a bit for a more rounded look (optional).
7. Stain dowels with stain color of choice (optional)
7. Spread glue/mod podge all over the back of the blank spot of paper at top and bottom. Then wrap around the dowel and glue to the back of the paper. (See pic)
8. Tie a piece of twine to either side of the top dowel and hang!",16,1734605055.0,BloodOnTheClocktower,4,0.95,False

1hhq8m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1hhq8m4/qcrit_adult_dark_fantasy_eclipse_of_shadows_85k/,"[QCrit] Adult Dark Fantasy, ECLIPSE OF SHADOWS, 85K, First attempt. First 300","Hi! I posted a simlar storyline and it wasn't where I wanted to be and went back to the drawing board. 

Dear \[Agent’s Name\],

I am thrilled to present my debut dark fantasy adult novel, ECLIPSE OF SHADOWS. Complete at 85,000 words, this is a standalone novel with series potential. It blends the magical world and mentor-student love interest of ZODIAC ACADEMY, spiced with the grim monster tormenting Elspeth found in ONE DARK WINDOW.

Saela thought her magic was her greatest strength—until she realized it might destroy her. Cursed by her bloodline, she carries the Shadow King, a monstrous beast trapped in her mind. He protects her, but at a devastating cost: with every use of his dark power, she inches closer to becoming the beast herself.

When a mysterious man delivers a letter from Saela’s long-dead mother, her life is upended. The message reveals a chilling truth: her mother’s death wasn’t an accident, and one of the only clues she left behind is to find the Heartstone—an ancient artifact that will reveal the truth. But danger lurks at every turn—predatory creatures that feed on magic are already hunting her, drawn by her untamed power.

The mysterious man who delivered the letter turns out to be more than a messenger; he’s Dorianth, a professor at Thornheart Academy. Whisked away to the hidden school of magic, Saela must learn to control her volatile abilities while navigating the Shadow King’s growing influence over her. As Saela and Dorianth work to uncover the Heartstone’s location, a tangled web of betrayal, forbidden romance, and perilous secrets threatens to unravel everything. If Saela fails, she’ll lose more than her humanity to the monster within—she’ll forfeit justice for her mother and hand over her power to the dark forces pursuing her.



The day my mother died, the world didn’t stop. I remember how the sun still rose, bright and blinding, as if daring me to grieve in its light. I wanted the sky to crack open, for thunder to roll and winds to howl, but instead, it was just another ordinary day. People went on with their lives, oblivious to the black hole that had swallowed mine.

It's crazy how life moves on even when you aren’t ready. Days turned into weeks. I still wasn’t prepared to face the reality of life alone—at least, that's what it felt like. The bustling street below our tiny, two-bedroom apartment never missed a beat. I hadn’t left the apartment much since my mother’s funeral; the outside world felt too big, too overwhelming. In here, I could pretend I was safe. But it was a lie, and I knew it.

The old couch groaned beneath my shifting weight as I kicked up my boots on the quilted blue fabric. I was supposed to be at work, teaching a class of half-asleep college students about Mythical literature, but I couldn’t bring myself to leave. The thought of standing in front of them, pretending everything was normal, made my stomach turn.

Filtered light flitted across the coffee table, dancing on the top of the stacked books that seemed to live there. I picked up one at random, running my fingers over the cover. *The Art of War.* It was one of her favorites. A crumpled piece of paper caught my eye, wedged between the pages. I pulled it out and smoothed it flat on my lap. My eyes rolled almost instantly as I took in one of her sketches, a frantic drawing of a creature with black fur, glowing red eyes, and sharp teeth. Mother had always been a bit off. In her own world, if you will. Always talking about astrology and mythical legends. It’s surprising that anyone took her seriously. She’d never shown her drawings to me, but I’d found them scattered around the apartment, hidden in notebooks, tucked inside old magazines, stacked in the drawer of her desk. At first, I thought they were just figments of her overactive imagination. Perhaps the result of too many sleepless nights. But now, I wasn’t so sure.",1,1734605000.0,PubTips,1,1.0,False

Scouring through the DeFi space it can be hard to differentiate the diamonds from the trash.

People screaming out of their echochambers saying that their specific memecoin is the best.

so how do you make the judgement on what is truly good? I have seen so many communities claiming ""Mine is the best! we are different!""

Thats not to mention how many are literally made on a daily basis,

""Every day, between 40,000 and 50,000 new meme coins are created, according to BDC, an Estonia-based blockchain consultancy. Nearly 13 million have already been created in 2024""

So how do you determine what is best?

There often remains a clear lack of alpha, genuine content and general conviction in the shilling methods I see. Just AI images that dont reveal anything.

\-----------

**Let me introduce to you, what I believe is King.**

Kendu is set apart, but for good reason.

Kendu has just become 2nd of all time, out of millions (13 million in 2024 alone)  to complete the massive 50 000 certik votes organically, only behind Pepe which is 10B+ now.

The agreement has now been signed on both ends, with Certik being so impressed by our community that they will begin doing an awareness campaign for us. A memecoin literally being shilled by an audit company. 

We are also only 1 of 2 memecoins in existence with our own dedicated stocktwits page. Them also consistently making posts on X about Kendu being in the top 10-5 most active cryptos on all of stocktwits.

Not only do we dominate the digital scape though, but we have transcended beyond ""memecoin""

Our community knows that it is a game of awareness, so we do exactly that.

Recently one of our community members (OG chadette who helped run up Shiba inu to the billions) is smashing out murals in the middle of Miami. 

She attended the Miami Art Basel event handing out hundreds of our energy drinks cans, and placing this painting right on one of the busiest intersections, where it is now to reside for more than a year (only to be replaced by another kendu mural)

Here you can see just how beautiful our energy drinks are in front of the mural.

1hhq6ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1hhq6ug/likeable_but_fundamentally_unlovable/,"Likeable, but fundamentally unlovable.","I have friends. Plenty. Some closer than others, some older than others. All different types of genders and sexualities and religions and backgrounds. It's a wonderfully diverse group of people. And, platonically, I'm certain many of them love me.

But come on. We all know what I mean.

Romantically, I am unlovable. To an almost comical degree. I've had romantic relationships in the past, and the most notable one converted into a friendship. I'm glad to to have him as a friend, of course! Truly, our friendship means a lot to me. But don't try and sell me on ""romance isn't important/great/worthwhile/the only thing that makes life worth living"" bullshit that gets sold to the completely inexperienced. I know better.

Let's get on to the meat and potatoes of the post. Why, exactly, I'm unlovable.

First up, I'm ugly. Not hideous, but ugly. I could list every specfic flaw but I'd sound like a caliper happy incel. Suffice to say: I have a weird shaped head, unusual skull structure, odd fat distribution, and a tiny face on big head. Like a Charlie Kirk photo manipulation. It's not a ""haircut and exercise will fix you!"" situation. 

Second: I am disabled. I cannot be a provider. I, in fact, require a bit more care than the average person. While I'm entirely independent (living on my own, doing my own chores, et cetera) I'm unable to hold gainful employment. I cannot drive. I am reliant on social security, which I was fortunate enough tTo get on. But 1.2k a month is hardly an impressive salary or one that could support a partner.

Third: I am boring. I have all the personality of watered down black coffee. A bit bitter, but not enough to leave an impact. I have no job and my hobbies are generic nerd hobbies. They are either solitary or hetero-male dominated. I have little interest in exploration or the outside world and after years of searching I've found that there is little else that interests me besides what I already do.

Fourth: I do not want kids. This is a bit of an opinion thing, but as most people do want kids eventually, I'm including it.

Those are all the big minuses. And, yes, no one individual one of these makes romance impossible. But all together? Come on. Be honest. Even if you were really desperate, would you date someone like this? Someone with no money, no prospects, no personality, no looks and no hope?

But, I don't want people to accuse me of being unfairly biased against myself. I do have a few things going for me.

One: I'm well endowed. Not huge but big. And I know how to use it and my hands with skill. Speaking of. 

Two: I have some skills, domestic and scholastic. I'm good with money, well educated, and know my way around basic home maintenance and repair.

Recently, I went to a speed dating event (and no, the women weren't psychic and could read my thoughts, and yes, I did my best to put my best foot forward) and all my potential matches must have agreed with my self asses because despite meeting 9 women I got 0 matches. 

It's been a decade since I was in a relationship. It's not a matter of time. It's not a matter of effort. It's simply a matter of incompatibility with the realities of romance. 

To me, a life without romance and intimacy simply isn't worth living. It's certainly possible that even a life with romance isn't worth living either, lets not kid ourselves, but a life without certainly isn't. At least to me. So, I will be ending my life soon. I have a few social commitments to finish, and that will be it.

Hi everyone!

My husband and I (both 27) are visiting Mexico City from Los Angeles from **December 22 to January 2**, and we’d love some feedback on our itinerary (attached as a screenshot). This is our first time visiting, and we want to make sure we’ve planned it well while staying open to adjustments. We’re on a budget this year after a tough loss of income but are determined to have a good time and be grateful to visit such a vibrant and welcoming city.  
  
The Teotihuacan tour, trajinera ride, and Lucha libre match have all been booked with some discount tickets!

We’ll be staying near the **Sevilla subway stop** and prefer to walk as much as possible - we usually walk for hours when we travel, stopping to sit in a park or share a cheap coffee when we get tired. We have saved up to enjoy one or nice meals and one or two nice nights out for drinks. 

My husband loves mezcal, so I'm planning to take him to **La Clandestina**, and I booked **El Lugar del Mariachi on a whim for Christmas Day** as I was nervous it would be hard to get into places without a reservation. 

We’d love recommendations for a special dinner spot in the USD $100-150 range for one of the other nights as our wedding anniversary falls on during the trip.

# What I’d Love Feedback On:

1. **Should we change any days around or add something?**
   * For example, would it be worth doing a day trip to **Puebla** or elsewhere for one of the quieter days?
2. **Recommendations for first-time visitors**
   * Especially art-related spots, since we’re both big art lovers.
3. **Dinner recommendation** for a budget of $100-150 USD.
   * A cozy, memorable spot for great food and atmosphere.
4. What **museums are open on Christmas Day/New Year's Day?** I've been scouring the internet to see if the Anthropology Museum is open on these days but there is nothing explicit on the website, so I am hesitant to bank on that.
5. **Any bars you'd reccommend for a chill night but has unique cocktails**? I'm excited to try the spiced horchata at La Clandestina, and wonder if there are other places that do those kind of specialty drinks for a little cheaper.
6. Anything else we should know as budget-conscious travelers?

Thank you so much for any advice or suggestions! We’re really excited about this trip and appreciate all the help.

I just bought my first espresso machine, a Lelit Anna. I've got a Baratza Encore (not ESP) for grinding my coffee, which I use with the Sage Precision Brewer.

When buying the Lelit I knew the Encore wouldn't be the best for espresso but I just didn't want to spend another 300€ on a grinder right now.

So I ground my beans (not dark roasted) with the finest setting on the Encore and tried a shot.

The coffee flowed almost instantly, with a pressure no more than 3 bars.

Also, when removing the portafilter, all of the puck is stuck to the shower screen! I tried with 7g coffee using the 7-9g filter so I don't understand what's happening.

After reading some topics and viewing some videos I know the Encore can be used for espressos (even though it's not the best).

What am I doing wrong? Should I recalibrate it?

After cleaning it I found the burr holder is broken, so I plan to buy a knew one.
